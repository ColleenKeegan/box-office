And one evening he realises his fare from LAX airport could be his dream girl Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith) is sexy smart - a prosecuting attorney no less - and sassy enough to hand him her card when he drops her downtown. Hes still reliving their conversation as his next customer - the natty needlessly provocative and patronising Vincent (Tom Cruise) - starts trying against regulations to hire Maxs chauffeuring skills for the whole night. The temptation of fast money wins out and while Max sits snacking outside the first of Vincents stop-offs the dream turns into a nightmare his clients on a killing spree needs transport and isnt about to let Max go off telling tales...If its genre fare you want theres very little on offer better than this taut tight bluesy urban noir. Right from Max and Annies opening duet its clear Manns happy on his home turf the dialogues crafted with as much imagination and expertise as the action scenes while the acting is excellent throughout (Mark Ruffalo Peter Berg and Bruce McGill also impress as cops tracking Vincents bloody trail while Javier Bardem has a nice cameo as the hitmans employer). Some elements (as when a check on the cab is dropped thanks to a timely call to the cops) are contrived but that comes with the territory; at least Manns close attention to detail makes it all credible according to its own very suspenseful plot logic and pacing. Along the way he also provides another existential riff on his favourite themes of professionalism pride responsibility and the need to take active choices. In short this cool clever elegant piece of precision-engineering is as intelligent engrossing and exciting as youd expect from the maker of Thief and Heat. I loved it.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Writes entire histories for his characters. Took a year including eight months of swordfight training to prepare for his role in ""The Last Samurai."" Theres practically an orange glow above this intense actors house at night. And in the highly enjoyable ""Collateral"" he brings that high energy to Vincent a superbad supermotivated super-everything walking-talking weapon of mass destruction. Smooth gray-haired satanically stubbled and seductively friendly hes an executive prince of darkness. And when Max (Jamie Foxx) lets him into his taxi the good-natured cabbie has no idea whats about to hit him. Just before Vincent makes his entrance Max has met Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith) an impossibly wonderful conveniently confessional and chatty prosecutor who tells him shes not feeling good about a coming case. She gives him her card. She likes him. Max suddenly has promise in his future someone to live for. A big reason to survive Vincent. If ""Collateral"" is all formula its polished to a fine sheen. (The less said about a silly coincidence that ties up both plots the better.) Director Michael Mann the riverboat captain of narrative flow has a knack for making one moment lap into the next. The suspense in ""Collateral"" turns on desperation character and situation as opposed to firepower muscle and engine torque. Youre lost in Maxs immediate problems which happen to be this I thought I had an excellent deal with this dude in a suit who paid me 700 for my exclusive taxi services for an entire night. But I cant help noticing hes a contract killer and Im the guy who has to keep the engine running while he makes his lethal house visits But wait theres someone better than Cruise in this movie Foxx. As Max he quietly pries the movie from Cruises big-marquee fingers. What a revelation he is. But I was already prepped for this kind of emergence. He was terrific as star quarterback Willie Beamen in ""Any Given Sunday."" And he was a memorable Drew ""Bundini"" Brown in ""Ali."" And theres every indication hell come through big as Ray Charles in the upcoming ""Ray."" Here hes entirely believable as the reserved silent dreamer marking a little too much time (12 years) as a cabbie. Will he ever do something about that limousine company idea? In Steve Beatties adroit screenplay Vincent is going to be his worst nightmare and in a way his greatest blessing. COLLATERAL (R 120 minutes) -- Contains violence and obscenity. Area theaters.

"Collateral The Meter Keeps Running washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Collateral The Meter Keeps Running Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday August 6 2004 The not-so-funny thing is that Tom Cruise is a better samurai in ""Collateral"" than he was in his last movie in which he actually played a samurai. Cruise is the gray-hued symbol of the universes mayhem in the new Michael Mann film a killer with an ironic sense of self a knowledge of jazz clothes cool enough to get him into GQ and a remorseless will. Its really his movie all the way His Vincent frosty of hair and beard feral and fierce with glittery rat eyes lives by the code and will die by it. Cruises savage beauty that prominent blade of a nose his tiny perfect darkness his athleticism just a whisper of vanity -- all come into play in what is certainly his best performance since ""Magnolia."" The movie that sustains this conceit is terrific a fever-dream of urban violence set in a neon nightmare. In this world Vincent is king. Vincent from nowhere no back story no bio no parents or family or culture Vincent the consummate professional is in to kill five witnesses in a single night and catch the 630 a.m. out of LAX for parts unknown. He dresses Italian shoots German (suits by Versace pistol by Heckler amp; Koch) talks like Norman Mailers White Negro and improvises brilliantly. He will get the job done no matter the opposition. Thats what he does. Thats all he does. He needs a cab however and he picks Maxs. You might say Hmm wouldnt his employers have provided him with a driver? They are professionals themselves and they would understand that reliable mobility is the key to Vincents run. However while you might say it before the movie and you might still be saying it after the movie you wont say it during the movie; its that gripping. Vincent leaves the airport terminal picks up a briefcase full of firepower and a laptop with addresses and names on the hard drive and gets into the cab which just happens to be Maxs after Max has dallied over an encounter with the perfect fare (Jada Pinkett Smith). Vincent meet Max (Jamie Foxx). Vincent Max is everything youre not everything you should hold in contempt. Hes almost your opposite a dreamy kind of fellow whos only driving a cab temporarily although the ""temporary"" has now lasted 12 years. He imagines owning Mercedes S-Class limos but he seems to have made no progress. He lacks not only your laser focus your ease at expressing yourself through murder your professional joy in doing the job well your love of the challenge but hes dressed like a kid in a mall. Hes one of those schnooks wholl wake up from his nap to discover he died three years ago. Yet the crux of the movie is that in the strange way Vincents mind works he comes to rather like Max. He loves Maxs eagerness to please his unwillingness to challenge his perfect obedience. He may even be a little lonely and having Max along is amusing given the high-stress nature of the job. Together the two begin an odyssey across the nightscape from one kill to another while the camera studies Vinces sharp suit and black pointy-toed shoes and Max frets his way through acts of rebellion quashed easily by Vincent. If this sounds not so much dicey as vicey -- that is ""Miami Vicey"" -- it should; the director Mann brought this form of jazz cool to crime stories many years ago on ""Miami Vice"" and other television work. He expanded it with ""Heat"" that great bank-job epic then gave it up with two dim misfires (""The Insider"" and ""Ali""). Nice to have him back in the hood. Heres the wrinkle Under the slick stylings the neon-through-windshield blur the sense of fog in the night air the prevalence of lots of men wearing sunglasses in the dark (kids dont try that at home) the movie has something of a therapeutic subtext. Vincent and Max dont end up holding hands singing ""Kumbaya"" and fire-walking together but its clear that in some old-fashioned John Wayne way the frosty Vincent is serving as a mentor to Max. He forces him to do and be things the laid-back underachiever could never have done or been. In the end Max becomes that which seemed utterly impossible in the early going a hero. The movie goes a little wobbly when Mann leaves the intensity of the Max-Vincent pas de deux. For storytelling purposes -- Mann needs a chase structure -- he cuts away frequently to a team of cops who begin to piece together (the corpses are helpful) the nature of Vincents mission and thereby work out ways to intercept him. These sequences headlined by the fine actor Mark Ruffalo really dont come to much but they effectively modulate Cruises intensity. And each of the hits has a visual freshness to it We look away at a key moment or a gun comes from nowhere at a key moment ending a jazz riff or the movie goes momentarily John Woo with a Hong Kong-style shootout in a Korean nightclub or two street punks dont know how overmatched they are when they draw on Vincent and he handles them with the samurais utter speed and style. ""Collateral"" is the best kind of genre filmmaking It plays by the rules obeys the traditions and is both familiar and fresh at once. Collateral (105 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for extreme violence.

Starring Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Directed byMichael Mann. (R. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Collateral"" is a good idea for a movie backed up by expert execution. Its Los Angeles at night where the streets are menacing but the cabs can feel almost cozy. Its Tom Cruise with gray hair a crisp suit and ramrod posture and its Jamie Foxx finding different ways to look scared for two hours of screen time not an easy assignment. Its straight-up entertainment not something to see and then talk about a month later but definitely something to enjoy. The movie was directed by Michael Mann (""The Last of the Mohicans"" ""The Insider"") a meticulous filmmaker who can film frenzy without getting lost in it and whose quiet scenes are just as interesting as his busy ones. Manns alertness to the subtle movements inside characters and to the interplay of people is unmistakable and it helps explain why the performances in his pictures are consistently superior. This one is no exception. A measure of Manns talent for the quiet comes in an early scene. Max (Jamie Foxx) is driving his cab and a lawyer (Jada Pinkett Smith) gets in. Shes wound tight getting ready for a big case the next morning but he charms her into talking. The scene isnt remarkable. Whats remarkable is the time Mann lavishes on it. Every gradation of their budding intimacy is offered up for our scrutiny culminating in a long arresting close-up of Pinkett Smith as the lawyer decides whether she should answer a question the cabdriver has asked her. Any director can point at a character and tell us we should care about this person. With Mann we start caring long before we know weve been manipulated. Then she gets out and Vincent (Tom Cruise) gets in. Hes a well-dressed well-spoken man with a leather case someone who could easily be mistaken for a businessman except that theres something off about his look and manner. Hes too slick too Eurotrash and too Johnny Mnemonic to be a corporate drone and if he were a playboy he wouldnt be carrying that case. He asks Max questions and responds to his answers with agreeable platitudes but his mouth twists down at the sides as he talks. If Max could turn around and just look at this mans face hed know that any Los Angeles wino in the backseat would have been less of a safety risk than this guy. Tom Cruise has always been a good solid actor. What makes him better than just a good actor is that hes a game actor willing to throw himself into odd characterizations to hide inside a part and play at the fringes of his star image. In ""Collateral"" Mann has him with a head of gray hair and a closely cropped gray beard a look that reads as both decadent and mechanistic. Within the limits of the script -- which is great for surfaces but doesnt go very deep -- Cruise tries to suggest a guy whose soul has been cut off from the spiritual oxygen that feeds everyone else. Hes dead inside with a flat dead voice someone completely alone and incapable of being anything but alone. At the same time theres no play for audience sympathy. Hes the villain and the cabdriver is our guy. It is soon very soon revealed that Vincent is a contract killer and so Max is a hostage in his own cab. Vincents proposed agenda is for Max to drive him to a set number of locations and for Max to wait in the car while he gets out and kills people. You know kind of like helping someone with a paper route only more morally challenging. ""Collateral"" which starts out tense builds from there with a series of suspenseful encounters and with a climax on top of a climax. The movie never fails. It never deepens either never plays with the premise or goes somewhere unexpected but its always satisfying. Foxx can act. Hes up to the roles demands conveying fear confusion and frustration but more important the exhaustion and recklessness that can easily follow when someones been scared for so long. Mark Ruffalo as an honest cop on Vincents tail and Pinkett Smith are vivid in modest roles. In an even smaller role and just as vivid is Spanish superstar Javier Bardem who turns up as a drug kingpin with his back to the wall. Bardem can be the sweetest guy in the world onscreen. Hes not that here. -- Advisory This film contains strong language and violence.

"Collateral | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; collateral ) Collateral (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli Collateral is a classic example of how casting against type can sometimes result in a remarkable success. Here we have Tom Cruise who has spent the majority of his career playing the good-looking likeable action/romantic lead placed into the role of a grungy (graying hair and lots of stubble) soulless sociopath with penchants for existentialism and jazz. Then theres Jamie Foxx the TV-weaned comedian of ""In Living Color"" and ""The Jamie Foxx Show"" who plays a low-key meek cab driver caught in a web spun by a capricious whim of fate. And despite being so far from their respective familiar acting backyards both of these performers pull it off. Cruise is chillingly credible as the cold cruel Vincent. And Foxx shows unexpected depth and humanity as Max whose night encapsulates the clichA(c) about being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Although it has a unique premise Collateral isnt a shockingly original motion picture. But the strength of the lead performances and the stylish direction of Michael Mann obscure the weaknesses in plotting and credibility. Although the final act of the movie feels like it was grafted on from a more traditional action picture Mann keeps the level of tension high enough that we dont really care. Collateral doesnt stand up well to post-screening inspection but its one of those films where the flaws dont become apparent until after the lights have come up. And its easier to forgive problems uncovered during after-the-movie quarterbacking than those that leap off the screen while the movie is unspooling. Cruise plays a contract killer who has arrived in Los Angeles to wipe out five people involved in a trial that poses problems for his employer. In order to make his way around the city he hires Max to be his personal chauffeur for the night. Max is dubious about the prospect of having only one fare but 600 quells his doubts. At the first stop when a dead body falls onto the hood of his cab he learns that Vincent isnt just in town to close a real estate deal. After that he quickly learns that his passenger has no intention of finding another ride and if he wants to stay alive his only choice is to satisfy his customer. For Max the night spent in Vincents company includes a number of bizarre detours including a stop at a jazz club and a visit to the cabbies hospitalized mother (Irma P. Hall). Plus Vincent offers a few tips on Maxs love life opining that Max should call an earlier fare (Jada Pinkett Smith) who left him a business card and ask for a date. If that is they both survive the night. From time-to-time Mann has a tendency to go over-the-top with the way his films look making them more about his directorial prowess than about their stories. This isnt the case with Collateral. The movie is shot conventionally albeit using some interesting shots and angles. (There are a lot of overhead helicopter views of the cab as it travels the semi-deserted post-midnight streets of Los Angeles.) Instead of focusing on camera hocus-pocus Mann centers his attention on developing atmosphere (theres a decided noir look to the movie and a growing sense of claustrophobia) and generating tension. Vincent is quick smart and dangerous. How is Max going to survive? Although other actors briefly cross the duos path this movie is all about Foxx and Cruise (the former more than the latter). One wonders why Jada Pinkett Smith agreed to the small generic part of a potential love interest/woman in distress. Irma P. Hall shows her usual spunk in a semi-comedic part as Maxs irascible mother. And Mark Ruffalo Peter Berg and Bruce McGill are on hand as the obligatory law enforcement officials who end up on Vincents trail. This is not an unconventional buddy story. Max and Vincent do not bond or become close as the night wears on. Instead this is about how extraordinary circumstances bring to the surface Maxs hitherto unrecognized strengths. Previously a dreamer Max discovers that he must now act. Vincent is the catalyst that brings about this change. For the hit-man theres no character development. Vincent is the same at the end as he is at the beginning. All of the changes are reserved for Max and Foxxs precise performance allows us to accept them. Although Collateral concludes with a flurry of action scenes (including shootouts and chases) it is not predominantly an action movie. The majority of the film is a kind of cat-and-mouse game between Vincent and Max as the two maneuver to get what they want. Vincent sees Max as a valuable resource. Max wants his freedom. At the moment Vincent gets into the cab the odds are stacked in his favor. By the time the night ends Max has emerged as more of a player than his adversary would ever have expected. Collateral is more compelling because of the interaction between Vincent and Max than because of the gunplay violence and chase scenes. The screenplay seems smarter than it actually is. (Maybe this has something to do with all the annoyingly pretentious comments Vincent makes about mans place in the universe.) Acting and atmosphere define the film but the bottom line is that there are times when style can become substance and this is one of them. Collateral is a strangely involving motion picture. The performances by Cruise and Foxx are the highlights and Manns direction assures that boredom and disinterest will stay at bay.

RELATED  Cruise Im ready to fall in love again YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Los Angeles (California) Trials Javier Bardem or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? (CNN) -- Michael Manns latest film ""Collateral"" starring Tom Cruise Jamie Foxx and Jada Pinkett Smith is a suspense thriller with little real suspense and few thrills.Its visually stunning with taut direction and excellent acting but the film never really takes off -- until the breathtaking chase scene during the last 10 minutes of the film.By then its too little too late.I kept waiting for the movie to kick in but ultimately I just couldnt get past the initial premise. But Dreamworks need not fear When it comes to box office Cruise is bulletproof and this flick will make millions.Cruise plays Vincent a contract killer who comes to Los Angeles to commit five murders during the course of one night.The five people in question are witnesses about to testify against members of a drug syndicate that is on the verge of being indicted by a federal grand jury. So far so good.But instead of renting his own wheels or getting some goon from the syndicate to drive him around he randomly hires a cab driver Max (played by Foxx) to chauffeur him through the dark slick streets of L.A.I just couldnt buy that. It feels like false jeopardy feeding fake dramatic tension. Why would a professional hit man -- no matter how psychotic -- take an eyewitness along on a murder spree?If you can get past the basic setup however Cruise and Foxx do make a great team.Max has ideas of starting up his own limousine service but after driving a hack for 12 years the dream is still a distant one.When we first met the laid-back cabbie he has picked up U.S. Attorney Annie Farrell played by the always stunning Pinkett Smith. The two make a bet over the fastest route to her destination; Max proves to be right.Charmed by his sweet manner and earnest approach to his job she gives him her business card at the end of the ride. Yes well hear from her later.His next fare will change his life.Vincent slides into the back seat of his cab and against his better judgment Max accepts a wad of cash to be Vincents driver while he makes a series of stops in order to do ""some business"" the exact nature of which he keeps very vague.When the first hit results in a dead body falling from a window and smashing into Maxs windshield things turn real nasty real fast. Instead of just killing Max for witnessing the botched hit Vincent forces him into becoming an unwilling accomplice.Again this makes no sense whatsoever. Of course if Max was knocked off at this point this would have made a very short movie.Soon after they make their deal theyre pulled over by the police -- because of the broken windshield -- but just when it seems that the jig is up the two officers are called away due to a major crime in progress.Again fake jeopardy and false dramatic tension. As the evening progresses the two develop a strange co-dependent relationship and again the entire situation is hard to swallow.On the plus side Manns muscular directorial style is felt from Vincents arrival at LAX in the very first scene.As always Mann makes the location -- this time the city of Los Angeles -- feel like an additional character adding another dimension to the film.Also toward the end of the movie Pinkett Smith re-enters the action and the final minutes of the film are hang-onto-your-seat thrilling.Mark Ruffalo (""13 Going On 30"" and ""You Can Count On Me"") Peter Berg (""Cop Land"" and the TV series ""Chicago Hope"") and Javier Bardem (Academy Award nominee for ""Before Night Falls"") all have supporting roles and their combined talents add a great deal of depth to the mix.Also of note This is Cruises first time out as a full-fledged villain. Sure he played a blood-sucking immortal in ""Interview With The Vampire"" in 1994 and a sleazy self-help guru in ""Magnolia"" in 1999 but never has he been so flat-out evil and he does a magnificent job (as does Foxx as his unwilling foil).For this role as a stone-cold killer Cruise has changed his whole look to help make the shift -- sporting gray hair and a tight custom-made suit both of which add to the transformation giving him a chilly distant authority and a sense of obsessive control.Bottom line There is a lot that is very worthwhile and extremely entertaining about this film. Manns visual style is without doubt unique and totally mesmerizing and the music (James Newton Howard is the composer) ranging from techno to jazz is first-rate.But again the scripts premise is built on a false foundation and ultimately I just couldnt buy it.""Collateral"" opens nationwide Friday August 6.

Years of fares have not prepared cabbie Foxx to deal with a hit-man passenger (Cruise) offering cash to be ferried to his ""appointments."" Dreamworks Pictures Shake it all up and you get Collateral a movie with only one conceivable flaw its disinclination to break new ground though no one held that against The Fugitive more than a decade of Augusts ago. With Cruise and Jamie Foxx equals in an urban thriller grounded in characterization Mann has come through with a stirring two-hour footnote to his masterpiece Heat the three-hour epic from 1995 also set in Los Angeles. In one of this years notable career leaps Foxx plays an ambitious but not quite motivated cabbie with the savvy to tune out the abrasive (yakky Debi Mazar) while chatting up the appealing (Jada Pinkett Smith) in a protracted set-up thats worth its considerable length for what it reveals. But 12 years of fares have not prepared Foxx to deal with a hit-man passenger (Cruise) who offers a wad of bills for transport to five middle-of-the-night ""appointments."" ABOUT THE MOVIE Open Water    1/2 (out of four) Stars Tom Cruise Jamie Foxx Jada Pinkett Smith Mark Ruffalo Director Michael Mann Distributor DreamWorks Rating R for violence and language Opens Friday nationwide Foxx who can use the money thinks hes dealing with a businessman. Then a corpse sails out of an apartment window and onto his cab a moment that redefines the rest of his life as much as it redefines the vehicles chrome. Then we witness a mutual head game Foxx grills the witty Cruise about an unpretty upbringing that makes the hit man less glib and Cruise pushes buttons of his own over Foxxs tendency to procrastinate on every level of his life. Eventually the movie enters Manns bailiwick. Heres a great director playing with his favorite tools bullets a jammed disco hopped-up soundtrack. Though some of this is predictable there are also some surprises. A visit to a quiet jazz club is one thing but this might be the only hit-man melodrama that gets one of its best scenes out of the killer instigating a hospital visit to chat up an elderly woman. Mann paints himself into the kind of bang-bang climax that can only come off as conventional -- though as in Heat which shared this kind of barely discernible letdown the wrap-up is still staged with craft and confidence. Compared with almost any major studio release this year Collateral is a super time at the movies a combination of sensual and acting pleasures. Among the ever-dependable performers who energize small roles are Pinkett Smith Mark Ruffalo Irma P. Hall Bruce McGill Javier Bardem and Peter Berg. But the story here is Foxx going one-on-one with two superstars a top-form Cruise and that almost-always-sizzling Mann behind the camera.

One of my favorite scenes in Paul Schraders script of Taxi Driver (1976) is when Robert De Niros Travis Bickle seeks out a philosophical cabbie called the Wizard (Peter Boyle) to try to come to terms with his freaky spiritual dislocation. The Wizard regards Travis with fatherly incomprehension but he makes a stab at framing the problem. ""A man takes a job and that becomes what he is"" he begins and proceeds to ramble on for about a minute in blue-collar existential mode. Travis listens earnestly and then says ""I dunno thats about the dumbest thing Ive ever heard."" I think of that exchange--both halves--whenever I see a one-word-title Michael Mann film like Thief (1981) Heat (1995) or the new Collateral (DreamWorks) because Mann is the American crime genres most Wizard-like existential philosopher of machismo. His thrillers pose the question What is a man? A thief a cop an assassin That might be what he does--but is that what he is? Is he free to choose or does a man gotta do what a mans gotta do? One thing thats clear is that Manns gotta do what Manns gotta do and thats give these pointy-headed conundrums a throbbing backbeat and the moodiest visuals in Hollywood. Mens fashion magazines have followed this director ever since his Miami Vice days. The way he frames his characters to bring out both their alienation and their glamour makes you think ""That is Gods loneliest man--and where can I get that suit?"" Advertisement There are two lonely men in Collateral. Max (Jamie Foxx) is an L.A. cabbie. He wants to own a fleet of limos but in the meantime he brings to his taxi-driver role a superhuman focus. Mann serves up montages of his buffing shining and collecting sundry bits of unpleasant detritus Max makes that taxi gleam and when he picks up a hotcha lawyer (Jada Pinkett Smith) he estimates her travel time to the minute. (Shes impressed--and the dialogue that follows is absolutely charming.) Maxs next passenger is Vincent (Tom Cruise) a hired killer whos every bit the perfectionist Max is. Vincent embraces his role because he doesnt believe in the interconnectedness of all things. The universe has been cruel to him and everywhere he looks (Rwanda the Los Angeles subway) he sees confirmation of its cruelty to others. If you think Im reading academic themes into a boneheaded chase movie well be prepared for taxi-cab colloquia between the killings. The dialogue--in this or any other context--is fairly ludicrous the plotting nonsensical and the mise-en-scene so overdesigned that in one shot the gas pumps are color-coordinated with the cab. But the first part of Collateral is magical anyway--the wittiest one-half-of-a-thriller Ive seen in years. The imagery is lyrical and jazz-inflected; and Mann can make the flare of a streetlight the reflection of the cab in a mirrored building even the curve of a windshield seem gorgeously expressive of the films emotional subtext. Visually this is a city-boulevard symphony (the directors of photography are Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron) and Stuart Beatties script is cunning black farce teasing and cruel. As Max watches Vincent pick off witnesses who can bring down a crime lord (Javier Bardem) the cabbie becomes the voice of humanity. He tells Vincent that the people hes killing ""are somebodys friends"" and Vincent replies in essence that were all alone on this earth anyway. Max is morally right but Vincent is way cooler with a samurai-like command of his artillery. He might be a sociopath but he also urges Max (correctly) to carpe the diem tells off Maxs exploitive dispatcher and even saves Maxs life. And so for a while neither character has the dramatic edge. Its too bad that halfway through Collateral turns into a series of loud chaotic over-the-top action set pieces in which the existentialist Mann proves hes lousy at action. All the characters including Mark Ruffalo as a cop and Bruce McGill as an FBI agent converge on a Koreatown  dance club for what seems meant to be a Hong Kong-caliber shoot-em-up with Vincent taking out scores of agents. Maybe someone else--say that spatial-temporal magician Brian De Palma--could have made it work but Mann does better with people striking poses than leaping and firing. His framing is too fancy and he doesnt give us our bearings Ninety percent of the time we have no idea where people are in relation to one another or even who just got shot. And the need to up the ante is ludicrous. Vincent who has previously tried to maintain his anonymity turns into the Terminator--so dedicated to his role he doesnt care if he kills everyone in the city. Max meanwhile has to prove that commitment to other people isnt simply morally superior to nihilism it also makes you a better marksman. Its lucky that Jamie Foxx gives a terrific performance The tension between nervous deliberator and the action hero is funny and against all odds believable. But Cruise isnt credible for a second. Its fun to see him with salt-and-pepper hair in a role where he cant flash that trademark smile. But he overacts not smiling. His robotic performance makes Collateral seem like the reductio ad absurdum of a Michael Mann movie--like mens store mannequins spouting Being and Nothingness to the strains of Audioslaves ""Shadow on the Sun."" As Travis Bickle might say ""I dunno Mann Thats about the dumbest thing Ive ever seen."" Correction August 9 2004 An earlier version of this article incorrectly located a scene in Chinatown. The scene took place in Koreatown. (Return to the corrected sentence.) David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

His cab is spiffy and he knows the most efficient route to take us from here to anywhere and to the minute the time required for the journey. Besides that hes polite helpful and despite a certain compulsiveness not without a spiritual side. Trim lightly bearded Vincent (Tom Cruise) is lucky to find him early on a noirish Los Angeles night. Since Vincent has a number of ""business"" appointments to keep before boarding a 6 a.m. flight back to wherever he came from he hires Max for 600 off the meter to drive him from place to place. We quickly suspect (from his elaborately polite neo-Nietzschean dialogue if nothing else) that Vincent is no ordinary businessman a fact that is borne in on Max when the first body slams down on his cabs roof. You may wonder at that point why a hit man who is also a compulsive planner and private person did not rent a car for his errands. But soon youre caught up in Collateral which is as much a dark odd couple comedy as it is a quirky efficient little thriller. And one must say a perfect vehicle for director Michael Manns highly stylized gifts. He has always been a creature of the night (Thief Heat) to which he habitually imparts a high-gloss shine thats at once chilly and seductive. He also has a predilection for cross-cultural -- and cross-class -- criminality (here waspy Vincent is rubbing out black and Hispanic drug dealers who may be about to sing to the feds). And for jazzy scores. But at his best Mann wears his hipness easily. It works particularly well in Collateral which has a nice minimalist quality about it -- just these two increasingly edgy guys their car and the people they encounter. Those include in Stuart Beatties low-key but curiously literate script a nostalgic jazzman a soulfully menacing drug lord -- and even Maxs hospitalized mom. The most significant of these others is Jada Pinkett Smiths Annie a prosecutor who as Maxs first fare of the night befriends him then turns out to be the last victim on Vincents list. Shes good but then so are all the actors in this little festival of naturalistic performance. They ground a plot thats full of logical inconsistencies and does not have quite enough completely compelling incidents to sustain its considerable length. But against these complaints you have to set the linear minimalism of its structure and its blessedly low-tech manner. This is a movie where the cops interrupt the action to pull over the cab for a minor infraction; where best of all LOW BATT starts flashing on the cell phone at a crucial moment. In other words this is a movie that manages somehow to fuse ordinary reality and more or less believable fantasy in a very insinuating way.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

One way or another in every Michael Mann movie theres a moment like this when civilization knocks up against its feral underbelly and gives way. Collateral is no exception but Mann means to make us wait. As the movie opens a poised young woman in a power suit gets into a taxicab at LAX and starts laying down the law about which is the best route to downtown. The driver Max (Jamie Foxx) is amused and relaxed; their banter is funny and sweet. But this is a Michael Mann movie Their faces loom huge on the screen the night air throbs with quiet menace and we tense waiting for a shoe to drop. It doesnt at least not yet but Mann stops to toy wickedly with our everyday fears about stepping into a cab driven by someone we dont know -- not to mention white paranoia about black men -- before he skitters on to full-court dread. The woman Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith) is also black and encouraged by Maxs sympathy and his openness about his own life she lets down her guard and confides her insecurity about her competence as a U.S. attorney. After some hesitation she gives him her business card and leaves and in short order we discover that Mann and his screenwriter Stuart Beattie have been softening us up for more macho terrors. Back at the airport another kind of control freak -- a hit man devoted to nothing but his head count -- flags Max down. Bound by chance and a directors lifelong fascination with pathogenic male symbiosis the two embark on the night ride of their lives. For all its out-there violence Collateral which is set fair to recoup in billions the box office losses of Manns high-minded 2001 bomb about Muhammad Ali has all the hallmarks of a safe bet. In style and substance this sleek thriller is a throwback to Manns 1995 Heat which also turned on a twisted relationship between two men apparent opposites trapped in that hoary old noir cliche the city as jungle. The edgy fluid camera work that Mann pioneered while working on Miami Vice and Crime Story in the 1980s has by now become standard practice in the dozens of television crime series that dot the prime-time schedules not to mention in scores of independent neo-noirs. Still no one working in the genre -- certainly no one who shoots digitally as Mann does here -- makes urban ennui and unease look more romantic or more intimately threatening. This is a movie that could only have been shot in L.A. with its traffic signals switching blindly above indifferent empty streets the city painted in deep blue and black its bone-deep loneliness relieved only by the glittering lights of downtown office buildings and the endless suburban deserts beyond. Collateral covers the same barren downtown landscape we saw in Heat only minus the small comforts of bright sunlight. (Minus too -- thank heavens -- Al Pacino at his grimacing overcompensating worst playing obsessive cop to Robert De Niros sphinxlike psychopathic robber.)

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm Maxs new fare Vincent (Tom Cruise) a suave player in silver hair salt-and-pepper beard and a crisp gray suit offers the initially reluctant cabbie 600 to shuttle him from one business appointment to the next. Max accepts and only when a dead body crashes onto the taxicab roof while he waits for his passenger in a dark alley does he realize that hes made a deal with the devil and theres no going back. Vincent it turns out is a hit man for an offshore drug cartel thats about to be indicted by a federal grand jury and his task for the night is to take out five key witnesses in the case. Little things go wrong and the two men end up being pursued through the back streets by the FBI a persistent LAPD cop (Mark Ruffalo) whose suspicions are aroused by similarities between the damage done to the corpses piling up in a hospital morgue and finally by the drug trade goons themselves. This joy ride of course is nothing more than a fine excuse for Mann to blow us away with a string of exquisitely orchestrated shootouts in seedy apartments in a rundown hospital among the swaying packed-together bodies in L.A.s ethnic nightclubs -- black Latino Asian -- that Other city of angels that so enthralls white Westsiders if only from a safe distance. Mann who clearly knows the Other city as well as he does his own strategically removes that distance. Declaring himself ahead of schedule Vincent insists Max take them to a South-Central jazz club ""for a break."" There he listens rapt while the black owner riffs happily on a long-ago encounter with Miles Davis. But what we imagine to be a self-indulgent grace note characteristic of liberal white directors in love with black musicality turns into something else altogether a quiet bloodbath at the end of which a victims head is lovingly lowered to the table by his attacker for greater neatness. Its a virtuoso sequence at once funny and terrifying. But after an hour and a half of this one feels jittery enervated and unable to focus on the relationship unfolding between the cracks of the gunplay. Mann has always been better at taking the pulse of a city than getting a bead on the hearts of men (like so many noir auteurs he has never quite known what to do with women and sex). In Heat the overwrought kinship between Pacino and De Niro -- opposites attract then find they have more in common than they want to know -- always struck me as pat and banal and the ending in which Pacino holds De Niros hand while he dies was hopelessly sentimental. Max and Vincents enforced intimacy promises something tougher and more tender. Early on in Collateral we learn that Max whos been working his night shift for 12 years (""Its only temporary"" he keeps repeating) dreams of starting his own celebrity limousine company in Vegas but claims he cant get it off the ground because ""everything has to be just perfect."" Played by Foxx with relaxed ease Max is stuck and he sort of knows it and Mann means to suggest that only a doer like Vincent can jolt him out of his rut. As the movies mischievously topical title suggests Vincent operates in a universe that has crossed the line from ""nobodys indispensable"" to ""everybodys disposable."" Unlike Max an identifiable Angeleno he comes from nowhere and commits to nothing except his job. Vincent redefines the meaning of a real pro and theres no one better suited to play him than Cruise with his anonymous good looks -- there are hundreds just like him playing volleyball on Santa Monica beaches or eating out in West Hollywood -- and his anodyne competence as an actor. It takes a dreamer like Max to break Vincents stride and as the movie draws to a close something almost human seems to stir in the sociopath while the loser gathers strength and -- literally in one of the movies funniest scenes -- speed. Mann loves fusing this kind of polarity perhaps because it ties together his own irreconcilable leanings -- the old-fashioned nihilist who created Hannibal Lecter in Manhunter versus the idealistic Madison Wisconsin New Left radical who took on the tobacco companies in The Insider a movie fired as much by moral passion as by a definable cinematic style. Like Heat Collateral will doubtless go down in film history as the noir marvel it undoubtedly is but I dont quite buy its characters and I came out of the theater still wondering what it had to say. Me I have a soft spot for that old 60s radical.

Michael Mann has elevated a story -- about a hit man forcing a taxi driver to take him on his appointed rounds -- into a mesmerizing ride. Piece soars on the directors style and interplay between Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Should translate into muscular B.O. in all markets. Reasserting his status as the cinematic master poet of nocturnal Los Angeles Michael Mann has elevated a gritty but straightforward story -- about a hit man forcing a taxi driver to take him on his appointed rounds during one violent night -- into a mesmerizing sometimes thrilling ride in ""Collateral."" Occupying a dramatic philosophical and sensory twilight zone that casts a considerable spell this intensely focused piece soars not only on the directors precision-tooled style but also on the outstanding interplay between leads Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Star power top reviews and powerfully delivered crime movie pleasures should translate into muscular B.O. in all markets. While Stuart Beatties original script has a clean forward-driving profile graced by pungent dialogue and shrewdly leavened doses of backstory there is the unmistakable feeling here of material pushed to the absolute extremes of its potential. Everything from the gun-metal gray of Cruises hair and suit the exceptional selection of precise locations and the dense mix of the soundtrack to the psychological overlays among the characters and Manns creative leap that led him to shoot most of the picture on high-definition digital video evinces an enormous sense of artistic concentration that translates into complete audience absorption in matters at hand. After his excursions into corporate political and biographical drama in ""The Insider"" and ""Ali"" Mann returns to the home turf he so voluptuously explored in ""Heat."" New film is not as ambitious as that staggering 1995 release -- its like a series of striking pen-and-ink drawings compared with a multicolored mural too big even for the giant wall its painted on -- and it deflates a bit toward the end as relatively conventional cat-and-mouse chase dynamics through an office building and subway take front and center after the bracing long-arc build-up. Its a smaller film but one that -- as a trawl through the citys scary underworld -- reminds at times of ""Training Day"" but also stands as a worthy Left Coast response to Scorseses indelible portraits of nighttime New York ""Taxi Driver"" and ""After Hours."" Projecting a fastidiousness underlined by that trusty old standby quiet desperation cabby Max (Foxx) engages both the viewer and his initial passenger in an unexpected heart-to-heart he has with the latter; Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith) is a formidable U.S. attorney who surprises herself by exchanging her professional insecurities with Maxs revelation of his own long-term intention to start a limo company. So sincere is their emotional chat that Annie whos about to argue a major case finds herself giving the humble driver her card. Also established in this opening scene is the fact that Max whos been navigating the citys congested streets for 12 years can predict virtually to the minute how long it will take by any route to get from one place to another. Its a talent that quickly impresses his next customer Vincent (Cruise) a man of unnerving purposefulness who offers Max 600 to drive him to the five appointments he has that night and get him to LAX by 6 a.m. A relaxed jazz arrangement of some classical strains is rudely interrupted when a mans body crashes onto the roof of Maxs car from the upstairs apartment Vincent first visits. Heavy electrified rock now takes over as Max suddenly finds himself thrust into a long nights journey into hell. With the dead mans body stuffed in his trunk Max is forced at gunpoint to chauffeur Vincent to his remaining jobs with his own fate at the end of the evening in severe doubt. Manns decision to shoot about 80% of the film in high def (a modified Thomson Grass Valley Viper FilmStream and the Sony CineAlta were both used) came from his conviction that the format more closely represents and exceeds what the human eye sees at night than does celluloid. Compared with the rich intense color palettes Mann has employed in his previous work ""Collateral"" has a more monochrome look that paradoxically combines a sense of deep darkness with a certain washed-out thinness and lack of visual weight. Punctuating this at all times though are the pervasive lights of the sprawling city the appearance of which justifies the use of the new technology; to be sure the sight of a succession of planes lined up in the air to land at LAX at night or the spooky yellow glare in coyotes eyes have never been so strikingly or realistically rendered as they are here. Vincent and Maxs deadly passage through this night which increasingly seems like a revelation of the fetid insides of an organism that would look perfectly presentable in daylight includes some close calls -- with police and some street hoodlums for starters -- that require some fancy footwork to escape. As Vincent begins to share details of his code and m.o. with his captive he emphasizes the need to improvise and adapt to circumstances advice that Max takes to heart when at a crucial moment he is forced to pretend to be Vincent. For a considerable time it remains unclear who Vincent works for; an individual most would call an immoral cynic and a philosophy student might identify as the reducto ad absurdum of the existential man he would consider himself an honest realist one who describes his work as ""taking out the garbage."" As written hes resolute very smart and at the top of his profession which becomes clear once its revealed whos hired him to knock off five crime-field VIPs in one night. Shadowing the pair through the dark is undercover narcotics cop Fanning (Mark Ruffalo) whose suspicions upon evaluating the first hit lead him closer and closer to Vincent and Max. Through the films ever-strengthening midsection one memorable set piece follows another A visit to a Crenshaw jazz club hinges on a meaning-laden exchange about Miles Davis between Vincent and the boites trumpet-playing owner (a superb Barry Shabaka Henley); Irma P. Hall invigorates a hospital visit the men pay to Maxs ailing mother; Max manages to turn the tables on his nemesis in a surprising chase that ends over a freeway and the great Javier Bardem nails his one scene as a drug lord who relates a telling little parable to his guest. But its all preparation for a sensational 10-minute Asian nightclub melee in which all the opposing forces -- Vincent and Max the cops led by Fanning and joined by Feds headed by Pedrosa (Bruce McGill) the suspicious drug lords goons and club henchmen there to protect Vincents quarry -- converge amid hundreds of oblivious revelers partying to a throbbing techno beat. The action in which many are killed is intentionally confusing up to a point but clear enough in the end and conveyed with cinematic command thats breathtaking. What comes after is also skillfully done but involves a degree of coincidence and contrivance that suddenly introduces a sense of Hollywood convention largely absent to that point. What ultimately happens to Vincent is dramatically apt and poetically lovely in the way it ties in with his own dismissive feelings about Los Angeles but final reel chugs along with some of the air palpably out of the tires. Shifting gears to play an outright villain Cruise is at or near his best here. Hard and cold and endowed with sharp practical intelligence Vincent has vulnerabilities that the actor reveals in carefully chosen moments. But its his ability to keep his eyes on the prize that defines him and its this trait that Max adopts of necessity to get through the night. Entirely dropping his comic persona Foxx proves a terrific foil. Establishing Max as someone others find easy to talk to Foxx doesnt overdo the characters shock and hysteria at his sudden misfortune nor does he make him seem overly weak only to become falsely brave. What he does do is create a memorable portrait of a very ordinary man placed in extraordinary circumstances. In a cast thats vibrant from top to bottom Smith connects strongly in her limited but crucial part and Ruffalo provides an extra dimension of intelligence to what initially looks like a stock cop role. Begun by Paul Cameron and taken over by Dion Beebe lensing is all of a piece according to Manns highly worked-out visual scheme. Editing is supple and imaginative and the sound work which combines James Newton Howards score with source music tunes of diverse origins and ambient noises plays a very large role in sustaining the hypnotic mood.
