Back in black and cutting no slack Kate Beckinsale returns as Selene the kickass vampire warrioress who always shoots first and never bothers to ask questions afterward in ""Underworld Awakening"" the fourth entry in the enduringly popular action-horror franchise launched by Len Wisemans ""Underworld"" back in 2003. Although the directorial chores have been turned over to Swedish co-helmers Mans Marlind and Bjorn Stein (billed jointly as Marlind amp; Stein) this latest episode extends the mythos and sustains the excitement of its predecessors with sufficient fealty to ensure another killing at the box office and a long afterlife on homevid. After being conspicuously absent (except for a fleeting cameo) from ""Underworld Rise of the Lycans"" (2009) a swashbuckling prequel to ""Underworld"" and ""Underworld Evolution"" (2006) Beckinsale slips back into the latex suit to resume Selenes crusade as Death Dealer extraordinaire in the secret centuries-long battle between vampires and werewolves (aka Lycans). The big difference here is that humankind finally has caught on to the fact that well vampires and Lycans have been battling each other for centuries and homo sapiens have frequently sustained collateral damage. ""Awakening"" kicks off with a briskly effective sequence that details the decimation of bloodsuckers and shape-shifters with ruthlessly efficient purges leaving both species near the point of extinction -- and Selene herself captured and cryogenically frozen by Antigen a biotech firm developing a vaccine against viruses thought responsible for monster making. More than a decade later Selene reawakens from her enforced slumber in an Antigen lab. Fortunately her captors have conveniently stowed her iconic outfit within easy reach -- a wink-wink touch sure to please series devotees -- so shes able to suit up before cutting a bloody swath through hopelessly outmatched security guards and making her escape. Outside in the brave new post-purge world Selene finds once-powerful vampire potentates such as the autocratic Thomas (Charles Dance) have literally gone underground with their covens and the few remains Lycans seem little more than malnourished nuisances who travel in dwindling packs. The good news Selena discovers that while she was sleeping she gave birth to Eve (India Eisley) a feral vampire-werewolf hybrid fathered by the presumed-dead Michael (a hybrid played in the first two pics by Scott Speedman). The bad news Eve is actively pursued by powerful Antigen chief Dr. Jacob Lane (Stephen Rea) who plans to use the girl as a very unwilling DNA donor. Once again Beckinsale brings an impressive physicality and subzero cool to her portrayal of Selene only occasionally revealing a flash of vulnerability when the Death Dealer isnt blasting fierce Lycans or dispatching inconvenient humans. It can be argued that what she offers is more presence than performance but that doubtless will suffice to inflame genre fanboys of all ages. Working from a script by series co-producer Wiseman and a small army of collaborators the helmers sustain a suitably rapid-fire pace -- without extended closing credits pic would clock in at under 80 minutes -- while noticeably elevating the level of graphic slice-and-dice run-and-gun mayhem. The action setpieces -- including acrobatically choreographed faceoffs and a basement-set battle royale pitting Selene against a humongous uber-werewolf -- are neatly balanced mash-ups of slo-mo posturing and breakneck thrills. And lenser Scott Kevan takes pains to give the Vancouver-lensed pic the distinctively icy blue-gray look that is this franchises trademark. Supporting perfs -- including those by Michael Ealy as a sympathetic cop and Theo James as a hunky vampire eager to kick Lycan butt -- are everything they need be and the overall tech package indicates that this time out producers have raised the budget a few notches (though the use of 3D doesnt add much). Their investment should pay off handsomely.

Underworld Awakening isnt that because thats just a good song. However what this latest installment of Underworld is a competently done fourth film (in an occasionally uneven franchise) is worthy of praise too. Kate Beckinsale is back and dealing out death rocking a black leather suit as hard as it has ever been rocked. You certainly cant accuse (jaccuse) them of false advertising here its Vamps vs. Lycans vs. Humans for all of the bloody marbles. When we last left our heroes they were upending the entire Vampire ruling class killing off elders with impunity. You might recall that Selene (Kate Beckinsale) started the series as a Lycan hunter evolving into something more once she met Michael the first Vampire-Lycan hybrid. The fourth film (though really no one counts the third one a prequel) starts off quickly with Michael and Selene on the run from the now fully aware human population. Lycans and Vampires are being hunted en masse and Selene and her beau are attempting escape from a furious pursuit. Selene gets close enough to see Michael and glimpse happiness only to realize theyre surrounded by humans with guns. A battle ensues an explosion Michael and Selene being torn apart fade to black. More than a dozen years later our heroine finds herself in a deep freeze but shes slowly waking up. Vampires have been pushed to the brink and Lycans are even worse off exiled to the sewers rarely seen by human eyes considered to be extinct. The detention facility that houses Selene is in chaos as she awakens something (or someone) else is attempting an escape. Selene sees through the eyes of this escapee just as she could with Michael all those years ago and just as quickly as she can dispatch copious amounts of lab support staff shes off to find her long lost Vamp-Lycan lover. But things are not as they seem and Underworld will again navigate the politics of the human-vampire-lycan condition. A new group of Vampires are found and a new group of Lycans are becoming a problem. As for the humans theyve become a tremendous source of trouble since they gained sentience regarding the centuries old battle waging around them. Selene will have to 1) Find Michael 2) Stay alive and 3) Solve a few mysteries before our 90 minutes together are up. Underworld Awakening thrives during the action scenes thankfully comprising more than half of the film. A tenuous sort of plot framework is established but it mostly leads to wondering when the next battle will start with the ""why"" not feeling nearly as important. A little girl named Eve plays a prominent role as does a detective hot on the trail of some human corruption. Kate Beckinsales ""Selene"" remains one-note but its a wildly entertaining note her crystal blue eyes bathed in the blood of her enemies. There are great Lycan moments too as a new strand has been developed which can only be described as ""much bigger and angrier than Jacob from Twilight"". The places where Underworld Awakening falters are hardly the point in the vast new release wasteland that is our January schedule. Lack of plot largely minimalist dialogue and no real beginning or ending are not to be held against the latest Underworld because the rest of it is big fun. Death blood chaos mayhem and lovely leather vengeance are the watchwords of this particular world and the film does well to keep them front and center. We dont know precisely why we pull for Kate Beckinsale other than that the camera mostly follows her around but we do. We definitely do.

No wan moony ""Twilights"" these were talking more than a thousand years of battle between Lycans (werewolves) and vampires recounted in three installments before the latest ""Underworld Awakening."" (""Underworld"" scholars see Chapter 3 ""Rise of the Lycans"" for some origin details.)Now the weaponry of choice depending on your persuasion fires slugs containing silver nitrate for offing Lycans or ultraviolet light for vampires (although Lycans in full-fur mode just use teeth and claws). Dank clanky settings; a bluish palette; and chewy bits of gore are the order of the day er night.Perhaps you remember Selene Ms. Beckinsales vampire and former scourge of Lycans (a death dealer in franchise parlance) she of the pale complexion black bodysuit and blazing twin automatics. Previously she and Michael a werewolf-vampire hybrid hooked up to their peers outrage. Now theyve been cryogenically preserved for more than a decade after the Purge -- an ethnic cleansing by humans against both species -- and somehow have a daughter Eve (India Eisley).In the prequels Bill Nighy as the top vampire-villain munched on flesh and scenery in equal measure; here Stephen Rea as a scientist after Eves DNA and Charles Dance as a vampire elder assume that duty. Photo Kate Beckinsale in her trademark bodysuit and twin automatics in ""Underworld Awakening"" the fourth installment in a series. Credit Screen Gems While vampires live underground and mangy Lycans dwell in alleys Selene is sprung from captivity and must rescue Eve and Michael allowing for lean lively sparring and splattery gun-muzzle encounters with neo-Harryhausen-esque werewolves. The combat quotient to the movies credit is way up with narrative folderol kept to a minimum. Is another sequel a possibility? Do vampires get thirsty?

Vampires and werewolves are back at each others throats in ""Underworld Awakening a sequel seemingly eager to assert that monster mashes are about B-movie chills not ""Twilight melodrama. Eager to a fault ultimately.After sitting out the series third installment Kate Beckinsale wriggles back into her rubber catsuit as heroic vampire Selene a ""Death Dealer tasked with eradicating enemy Lycans. Selenes mission was complicated over the first couple of movies by her romantic involvement with vampire-werewolf hybrid Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman oddly subbed for here). This time out shes sent reeling completely by a human purge of both supernatural species that lands her in laboratory cryo-freeze. (The frenzied news channel-surfing opener never explains how exactly the humans got wind of the creatures existence much as the original never bothered explaining their mutual preference for ""Matrix-caliber guns over fangs.)When Selene is suddenly thawed out 12 years later shes got no idea whats happened to Michael or what the pursuing lab guys want with her. Fortunately shes not so disoriented that she cant still deal death efficiently and more viscerally than ever. She also doesnt initially grasp her psychic link to a young girl Eve (India Eisley) although you wont need to be psychic to beat the script to the answer. Among the characters in lathers of varying sorts over Eves special abilities the labs duplicitous chief scientist (Stephen Rea) a hunky vampire resistance fighter (Theo James) and the hunks purge-whipped father (Charles Dance channeling Peter Cushing).Swedish filmmaking duo Mans Marlind and Bjorn Stein (""Shelter) energetically render a transformed Eve as a sort of digital age Linda Blair all creepy blue skin and demonic eyes. (Its one of the movies better effects along with Lycan-busting silver nitrate bombs whose detonation leaves a 3-D screen looking like an action-movie snow globe.) But the filmmakers make overly quick work of a good scene that has Eve questioning Selenes lack of maternal warmth. Your inner geek is stirred to wonder Would a vampire have that within herself? Would a vampiric assassin? Exploring the question might have made ""Awakening a movie with an identity rather than the most generic entry of the bunch.

(JOE LEDERER)By David Hiltbrand Inquirer Staff WriterPosted January 21 2012The original death-dealer is back. After taking a break from the third Underworld film Kate Beckinsale zips into the full-body black leather sheath once again to play Selene the trigger-happy supernatural sheriff who targets werewolves humans and even her own kind vampires.You want a herd thinned Selenes your girl.As this sequel begins Selene has been cryogenically frozen for 12 years as humans have been systematically purging the world of the spookier species who have lived among them for centuries.The cold temperatures did nothing for her disposition. She thaws right into a ruthless killing frenzy.Awakening is a departure for the Underworld franchise moving it from the horror genre to grind fantasy. The action sequences vault from special effects to cartoonish Selenes physical abilities go from enhanced to impossible.And not to give away the plot (are Underworld fans even aware these films have plots?) but nothing has happened that would explain why Selene has become such a remorseless reaper.She may be the most lethal undead woman alive but with those piercing ice-blue eyes choppy Princess Valiant hair and button nose shes always going to have admirers.In this case its a police detective (Michael Ealy) and a coven heir (Theo James) who follow Selene around like puppies risking certain death for just one of her crawl-hither looks.Awakening climaxes with a Matrix-like assault on a medical facility overseen by the duplicitous Dr. Lane (Stephen Rea). The last 10 minutes have more splatter than a finger-painting contest among giant babies.Theres not much to this movie beyond a slick procession of dark gleaming violence. But Selene lovers would pay good 3D money to see her fight a parking ticket. Underworld Awakening 1/2 (out of four stars) Directed by Mans Marlind and BjAPrn Stein.

"Underworld Awakening review Kate Beckinsale is back in spandex - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Underworld AwakeningUnderworld Awakening movie review Kate Beckinsale is back in fighting and spandex form in the vampire-werewolves series.January 23 2012|By Glenn Whipp Special to the Los Angeles Times Kate Beckinsale stars in the fourth film in the long-running franchise. (Joe Lederer / Sony Pictures )""Underworld Awakening"" begins with a tidy three-minute wrap of the series first two movies (the third a 2009 prequel minus star Kate Beckinsale doesnt figure into the equation) before revealing the current grim state of affairs for its clashing vampires and werewolves. Humans at least those oblivious to the charms of the ""Twilight"" movies have decided to stop killing each other and focus on eradicating creatures possessing fangs. Our vampire antiheroine Selene (Beckinsale) finds herself cryogenically frozen in a laboratory before someone (or something) mysteriously breaks the glass facilitating her reemergence. Conveniently her captors have left her spandex suit and knee-high black boots right next to her pod though youd think wiggling into that get-up after a dozen years of slumber would require a dexterity beyond even her extraordinary skills. And make no mistake those superhuman skills receive a workout in ""Underworld Awakening"" a brisk creature-feature that ditches the series dreary mythology in favor of a more direct action-oriented approach. The ""Underworld"" movies could never exactly be called ""fun"" but Swedish directing duo Mans Marlind and Bjorn Stein manage to bring a bit of visual flair to the bloodletting along with another quality previously in short supply a competence. That either makes ""Awakening"" the best movie in the burgeoning ""Underworld"" franchise or the worst depending I suppose on how deeply you value the series previous strained attempts at myth-making. Here the four credited screenwriters have created a workable (though easily solved) mystery surrounding the 12-year-old girl (India Eisley Shailene Woodleys little sister on the ABC Family series ""The Secret Life of an American Teenager"") who was frozen along with Selene while wasting little time setting up a scenario that pits vampires against steroid-pumped werewolves (or Lycans if you must) in numerous CGI-aided scenarios. Beckinsale playing Selene as a memory-swiped Jason Bourne finally manages to perfect the monotone delivery shed been honing for the series first two entries. As if by explanation she tells the girl at one point ""My hearts not cold. Its broken."" At least she has all that spandex and leather to keep her warm. One of the outright pleasures of the ""Underworld"" movies has always been watching fine British thespians a Michael Sheen Bill Nighy Derek Jacobi a chew scenery along with various other body parts. ""Awakening"" gives us two new additions Stephen Rea playing a mad scientist with all the relish of a man about to go into a sensory deprivation tank and on the other side of the spectrum a campy Charles Dance as the pragmatic leader of one of the last remaining vampire covens. As to whether either will be around for the fifth film that this movies finale dutifully sets up we cant say. But thats OK. Now that the ""Harry Potter"" movie franchise has come to a close there are plenty of notable English actors available. Hopefully they can keep the costumes along with the paychecks. calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESParaNorman The Awakening put ghost images on movie...August 15 2012Underworld Awakening takes big bite of box officeJanuary 23 2012Movie Projector 4th Underworld to soar higher than Red...January 20 2012MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesEntertainmentVampireUnderworldCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-underworld-awakening-20120123,0,54079.story?track=rss",200,underworldawakening5,underworldawakening,latimes

(Screen Gems) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Friday January 20 2012 452 PM Title Underworld Awakening Film Info A vampire emerges from hibernation to find humans battling supernatural creatures. With Kate Beckinsale Stephen Rea. Directors Marlind and Stein. (128) R Violence. At area theaters. This is technically a review of ""Underworld Awakening"" and well get to that in a minute. For now though its as good an occasion as any to make a last-second rant about the quality of Andy Serkis work in ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" especially prior to Tuesdays Oscar nominations and in comparison to Kate Beckinsales work in this latest dreadful entry in the vampires-battling-werewolves franchise. Beckinsale likely went home after a days work on ""Awakening"" assuring herself that this is acting of a sort -- she does have to look stern and steely at times while at others she needs to look steely and concerned. Then the directors two men who go by Marlind and Stein would presumably shout ""cut"" and in a computer somewhere Beckinsales digital avatar got thrown against a wall walked in slow motion with a black trenchcoat billowing behind it or leaped off a building. Thats likely what most of Hollywood --- and maybe moviegoers as well -- think of when they think of CGI performances. And theyre partly right; the CGI in ""Underworld"" is giving a ""performance."" Yet thats not the same as a great voice performance in a movie like ""Toy Story 3"" or ""Rango"" or a motion capture performance like Serkis gives in anything but especially last summers ""Apes."" Theres a video Twentieth Century Fox has released to the Web that shows Serkis acting out a moment from ""Apes"" opposite costar James Franco followed by the finished scene -- so its Serkis as himself and Serkis-as-Caesar. That instance alone has more power and impact than anything Beckinsale does in ""Underworld Awakening."" Admittedly ""UA"" is merely a would-be videogame adventure on the big screen with 3-D added to boost ticket prices and make the murky dark scenes seem even more muddy. (Its stunning that anyone thinks action films set mostly at night in dingy surroundings are ""perfect"" for 3-D conversion.) Beckinsales Selene the vampire ""Death Dealer"" who fought the shape-shifting ""Lycans"" before falling in love with one in the 2003 original bounds around in her ridiculous leather snowsuit shooting silver bullets at the vamps sworn enemies after coming out of a longtime cryogenic freeze. This time out both supernatural societies are at war with the humans whove discovered ""two distinct species living amongst us"" and have set about exterminating both using ultraviolet light and silver. But a mad scientist (Stephen Rea) has a lab where hes using Selenes 12-year-old daughter named of course Eve (India Eisley) -- her dad was Michael the half-Lycan/half-vampire Selene loved -- as an experiment. With his research hell destroy each set of monsters ... or rule the world Michael Ealy shows up as a human cop worrying about something nefarious going ""all the way to the top""; Charles Dance is a vampire overlord who blathers on about ""the years between the first and second plagues""; and Selene realizes she can see through Eves eyes and vice-versa. Hopefully she wont be bothered by the cobalt-blue tinge digitally added to Beckinsales peepers. Its clear that vampire movies have become the Shakespearean dramas of our day whether we want them to be or not. So for every ""Let the Right One In"" or ""30 Days of Night"" or even ""True Blood"" therell be another ""Underworld"" entry (with the ""Twilight"" films being ""Romeo and Juliet"" apparently.) Next time Beckinsale will likely complete the transformation and act via the icamera on her computer. Serkis meanwhile waits to see if his art will be recognized for what it is.

Defrosted after 12 years in cryogenic suspension Kate Beckinsales slinky Lycan-slayer Selene awakes to a world where both Vampires and Lycans have been hunted to virtual extinction by genocidal humans. She also discovers that she has a daughter Subject 2 (India Eisley) who is being used as a guinea pig by ruthless bio-tech scientist Dr Jacob Lane (Stephen Rea). With the help of a sympathetic cop detective Sebastian (Michael Ealy) and a handsome male vampire David (Theo James) Selene infiltrates Antigens fortified lab hoping to rescue her hybrid off-spring. But she hasnt reckoned with a hulking genetically-enhanced uber-Lycan capable of casually tossing cars and punching holes in walls.Swedish joint-directors Mans Marlind and Bjorn Stein who previously made the preposterous supernatural thriller Shelter make a wolfs breakfast of everything. Not only do they fail to explain or expand the series overarching mythology they completely fail to capitalise on the potential of the new story elements. By way of compensation they offer surprisingly nasty 3D violence and messily choreographed fight scenes featuring more wire-work than a computer factory. Beckinsale looks as fetching as ever in her skin-tight latex outfit but not even her much-anticipated return can enliven the proceedings. One feels sorry too for striking 19-year-old actress Eisley whose portrayal of Selenes daughter is every bit as blank as her characters naivete leads one to expect. By the same token Reas hopelessly underdeveloped villain barely registers. Crude cheap and pointless this surely drives a stake through the heart of the Underworld franchise.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Movies Underworld Awakening Me Somewhat Lycan In this flashy fourth installment Kate Beckinsales vampires and their rival werewolves battle a vicious new species humans By Richard Corliss Jan. 20 2012 Share Read Later Screen Gems / Sony Pictures Entertainment Underworld Awakening Year 2012 Director Mans Marlind Bjorn Stein Studio Screen Gems Actors Kate Beckinsale Stephen Rea RelatedKate Beckinsale Poised to Kick Butt With Underworld Awakening Reuters/The WrapMovie Projector Fourth Underworld to soar higher than Red Tails Los Angeles Times Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture When studio heads think one of their films can be marketed to audiences without the taint of early reviews they dont show the movie to critics ahead of time. We get the message anyway the picture usually sucks swamp water. So Underworld Awakening fourth in the franchise that began in 2003 and chronicles the enduring enmity of vampires and Lycans (werewolves) tiptoed into its Thursday midnight showings wreathed in the mild stench of its sponsors shame. A modest surprise Of all the movies whose makers designate them as crap by not screening them in advance for critics forcing me to go to a multiplex in vampire hours and write a review in a sour overnight stupor Underworld Awakening is one of the best. Kate Beckinsale after being excused from the third-episode prequel Rise of the Lycans fronts the series again as Selene the vampire goddess. The fine fresh airs the young Kate exuded two decades ago when Kenneth Branagh plucked the teenager from the Oxford University Dramatic Society to appear in his film of Much Ado About Nothing have cooled into a mistral of chic tough womanhood. At 38 Beckinsale makes Selene a vampire to die for especially if youre a Lycan. She sports crystal-blue eyes sleek longcoats from the Woo-Tarantino couture shop and stringy hair that swirls in so many directions independent of its wearer that it seems to have gone to its own acting class. Next itll want to direct. (MORE Corlisss review of Underworld Rise of the Lycans) A member of the vampire subspecies known as Death Dealers (but in a nice way) Selene possesses certain useful skills. She can outfight man wolf or bat-man; can leap from tall buildings at a single bound and land without her body collapsing like a closed accordion; can dodge a fusillade of artillery fired by klutzy cops. Another peace officer shoots her point-blank in the forehead but its the merest flesh wound; the bullet ejects itself like a watermelon seed her brain spat out as Selene reverts to type and snacks on the unlucky assailant. Later when she uses her switchblade to start a car a guy in the audience shouted ""Marry me"" In the screenplay credited to six writers (including Len Wiseman director of the first Underworld and Beckinsales husband) humans have finally taken notice of the vampires and Lycans living in their midst and resolved to eradicate them. Years after her last appearance Selene has been cryogenically frozen as ""Subject One"" in a lab run by evil scientist Jacob Lane (Stephen Rea vacationing from Anglo-indie fare and apparently not enjoying the trip). ""Subject Two"" is Eve (India Eisley the daughter of long-ago Zeffirelli Juliet Olivia Hussey and Shailene Woodleys kid sister on the ABC Family series The Secret Life of an American Teenager) whom Selene springs from her ice casket and brings to the vampires sub-subway lair. (MORE See James Poniewozik on The Secret Life of an American Teenager) The presence of these two intruding females annoys the cautious head of the clan Thomas (Charles Dance doing an imperious impersonation of a Brit Mitt Romney) but Selene wins him over with some preternatural CPR when his hunky son David (Theo James) is slaughtered by the more virulent strain of Lycans that Dr. Lake has been breeding in his lab. Cutting open the dead Davids stomach she thrusts her hand into his chest cavity--we get an interior point-of-view shot--and vigorously massages his heart back to life. Not quite in the class of the first film Underworld 4 is still the most enlightened girl-power film of the week nosing out Gina Caranos Haywire by the length of Pinocchios proboscis. (It wouldnt be a stretch to call the Underworld movies a dandier vampire-werewolf franchise than The Twilight Saga.) The Swedish director duo of Mans Marling and Bjorn Stein who go by their surnames only and previously helmed the Julianne Moore thriller Shelter attack the project in patented Euroflash style shades of silver swathing the actors cunning integration of live-action and CGI stunt work and nearly everyone but Beckinsale prone to pouting. To give viewers some bang for the four-buck 3-D surcharge Marling and Stein toss virtual glass and spurting blood the audiences way every few minutes. (MORE See Corliss on the girl-power movie Haywire) The movies climax in the basement garage of Dr. Lakes lab features four separate fights each pitting a good guy or gal against a steroidal Lycan villain. As cleverly choreographed as this tag-team octet is it doesnt stick in the gut like a single earlier shot the sight of a body defenestrated from a great height crashing on the top of a car. The shot a quote from the Hong Kong cop drama Infernal Affairs (which was remade but not equaled as The Departed) manages its own jolting impact. (MORE See Corlisss review of Infernal Affairs) That the discussion has turned to a few seconds of body-smashing car-crushing stunt work should indicate that Underworld Awakening is not exactly the classic play Spring Awakening or even the rock musical made from it a few years ago. The film has nothing on its mind except diverting people who want to get out of the house after midnight. But it does suggest a distinction in two kinds of action movies the critics fave Haywire in which Oscar-winning director Steven Soderbergh pays little heed to narrative flow or coherence and this Underworld with its slick corporate craftsmanship. The first picture is smart-stupid the second stupid-smart. And Ill take the idiot-savant pleasures of a vampire movie any day.

Share Tweet This is the visual aesthetic of Underworld Awakening the fourth movie in the vampires-versus-werewolves action franchise A well-appointed operating theater in a lavishly funded lab is lit entirely with flickering fluorescent lights such that everything looks dim murky and blue-black. Its the exact same lighting scheme seen in a devastated parking garage after a huge battle later in the film or for that matter as the world outdoors save for the flickering. That tedious unimaginative sameness of texture and color extends throughout the rest of the film and extends to all other aspects of the production The story the acting the action choreography and the direction all remain unvaried throughout. Watching the film is strangely like looking at the same three still frames of supernatural battles over and over for 90 minutes. Either that or like watching one of the Resident Evil movies again or Ultraviolet both of which Awakening seems to have looked to for basic plot points. Previous Underworld movies have mostly been distinguished by their curious devotion to intricate backstory but all that goes out the window in Underworld Awakening in favor of an utterly uncompelling McGuffin plot that lets Kate Beckinsale spend most of the film shooting stabbing or exploding CGI enemies. When the existence of werewolves and vampires becomes public knowledge humanity launches a brutal pogrom against them. Beckinsales vampire assassin from the first two films and her hybrid vamp/wolf lover (previously played by Scott Speedman who didnt turn up for this installment which works around him) wind up in a lab where they spend more than a decade unconscious. When Beckinsale revives she learns she now has a daughter whom the werewolves want. So she fights her way out of the lab fights to reach the girl fights to protect the girl and barely lets up til the final scene. Swedish directorial partners Mans Marlind and Bjorn Stein (taking over from Beckinsales husband Len Wiseman who co-scripted and produced) have pretty much two thoughts in their heads regarding Underworld Awakening that Beckinsale looks good in a skin-tight suit and flowing black duster particularly when she lands in a casual crouch after jumping from a great height and that CGI werewolves roaring leaping and getting shot never gets old. But given the films barely pro forma plot and generic action it obsolesces surprisingly quickly. Stephen Rea (as a cold-blooded lab head) and Michael Ealy (as a beleaguered detective) highlight the problem Each explains the motives for their extreme and unlikely actions via a handful of halfhearted lines then rushes back to the plodding battle. Only Beckinsale seems invested in her choices or the outcome and her single facial expression cant carry an entire film. When Awakening ends on a pause before a battle setting up another sequel to come its less a promise than a threat.

TWITTER Kate Beckinsale returns to star as vampiress Selene who wakes up after being in a cryogenically frozen state for 12 years. The fourth entry in this profitable B-movie series helpfully brings its viewers up to speed with a quick recap of the first two movies (conveniently skipping the third which star Kate Beckinsale sat out). The comely British actress -- who also can be seen in theaters now as the wife-in-peril in Contraband -- has returned to once again don the skintight black latex outfit that is these films biggest draw to fanboys. More aggressively violent and thankfully less mythology-driven than previous installments Underworld Awakening is strictly for the converted. PHOTOS The Evolution of Film Vampires This film begins with vampiress Selene waking up after being in a cryogenically frozen state for 12 years a convincing plot element since the 38-year-old actress doesnt seem to have aged a day. Apparently we humans have gotten hip to the preponderance of Lycans -- werewolves to the uninitiated -- and bloodsuckers in our midst and have made determined efforts to eradicate them. Busting out of the lab Selene takes no prisoners. Indeed the character seems even more ruthlessly violent and murderous than in the previous films perhaps the result of having been rudely awakened from a nice long nap. Accompanied by a hunky vampire (Theo James) and a young woman (India Eisley) awakened from a similarly frozen state Selene finds herself in an endless series of violent battles with both humans and Lycans -- who are in many cases one and the same. Along the way a sympathetic cop (Michael Ealy) tries to help out with unfortunate results. VIDEO Kate Beckinsales Underworld Awakening 5 New Clips Released The actress goes through her energetic paces and an awful lot of wire work with the requisite athleticism and steely facial expressions. When shes not actually fighting her performance consists of little more than striding purposefully toward or away from the camera ""Im not good with feelings"" Selene accurately points out. Swedish directors Mans Marlind and Bjorn Stein -- theyre billed by just their last names in the credits which admittedly looks cooler -- keep the pace frenetic enough that the film clocks in at just 89 minutes. This is the first of the series to be done in 3D but -- considering the monochromatic blue-gray palette the frenzied editing and the general darkness -- it results only in making the proceedings harder to see in an additional dimension. As is customary for the series there are veteran British actors on hand to pick up a quick paycheck. Here replacing such predecessors as Bill Nighy and Derek Jacobi are Stephen Rea as an evil scientist and Charles Dance as the head of a vampire coven. Both look despondent that they no longer have any Harry Potter movies to provide an alternative form of financial security.
