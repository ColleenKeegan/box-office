Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review When Vampires Mate The fourth Twilight film islike a lot of weddings and birthsan unexpectedly primal experience. _ By David Edelstein Published Nov 21 2011 ShareThis (Photo Andrew Cooper/Courtesy of Summit Entertainment) The Bella-Edward-Jacob triangle at last lives up to the mass hysteria in Bill Condons The Twilight Saga Breaking DawnPart 1 the ferociously powerful first half of the last quarter of Stephenie Meyers series about a girl who gets under the skin of both a vampire and a werewolf and knows that going to bed with either one may get her ripped to pieces but what the hell. Condon and screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg waste no time building terrific tension sexual and psychosexual opening with an engraved invitation to the nuptials of Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) that drives Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) to tear off his shirt and go bounding on four hairy legs to the Northwest Territories. Along with cultivating the usual bridal anxieties like walking in heels under a long train Bella has a vision of a cake layered with bloodied corpses of her loved ones. Alas the reality proves ickier. See Also  What Not to Expect From Breaking Dawn  Will Twilight Obsess New Generations in Twenty Years?  Slideshow Twilight Premiere Looks The previous three Twilight movies ranged from so-so to stultifying but there was never a doubt that Meyers mythology came from somewhere deep. This was an erotic Mormon female meditation on motifs that Anne Rice finally wrested from Catholic boys for whom the crucifix was all that kept their women pure and hair from sprouting on their palms. In Meyers universe what could easily be Rices decadent white European sadomasochistic bloodsuckers come to the New World to keep their lust at bay and do good works. Theyre further restrained by a clan of Native American werewolves with its own issues re hard-to-control appetites and a sworn oath to police the frontier for vampires. At the center of course is the tension between a young womans compulsion to mate and her partners terror that doing so will unleash demonic forces that will eviscerate her. Since the Twilight phenomenon exploded Pattinson and Stewart have proven frail superstars wilting under the flashes of the paparazzi. This actually adds to their onscreen credibility. Pattinsons whey-faced Edward paces frets and looks incapable of bearing his own handsomeness while Stewart even whiter and bonier than her ghoulish beloved seems almost literally petrified by her passion. The wedding procession in which Condon alternates shots from Bellas point of view as she moves toward her intended with quick flashes of their courtship and shots of Stewart palpably shivering is a triumph of subjective filmmaking. In the toasts that follow the words are double-edged. Anna Kendricks delightful bubbly cameo as Bellas high-school friend shows how far the teenage bride has come whereas Edwards romantic projections (Ive been waiting what seems like a very long time to get beyond what I am) show how far her grown-up love is expected to go. The PG-13 honeymoon off the coast of Rio is not quite the orgy of blood and bodily fluids weve been anticipating but the pregnancy that follows is more visceral than any wed dare to dream a vision of Bella being consumed from the inside hollows opening up around her eyes and under her cheeks her only nourishment turning out to be blood she sips through a straw her eyes briefly shining as she says quietly Its good. The pregnant womans body knows what it wants. While the werewolves mass outside waiting for the unholy birth of the baby theyre pledged to destroy the vampires wilt and Bella readies herself for her likely death. Is there a political message in Bellas insistence that the fetus however monstrous is not an it but a child that must be delivered? Im not ruling it outbut context people. In any case the last twenty minutes of Breaking Dawn are so harrowing that its possible to forget that most of the acting is soap-operatic (the guy who plays Carlisle is aging to look like Liberace) and the dialogue from hunger. The movies that primal. Early on theres a flashback to Edwards past in which he surrenders to his vampire instincts by becoming a Dexter-like serial killer of serial killers. Its very dumb but the sequence opens in a movie theater with a wonderful in-joke Elsa Lanchester shrieking at the sight of Boris Karloff in The Bride of Frankenstein at once a nod to James Whale (Condon made Gods and Monsters) a cheeky reminder of much worse marriages and a sign that the director is in touch with the genres poetic high pointand the thin membrane that separates the honeymoon suite and the sepulcher.

Photo ""I know how this ends"" Jacob (Taylor Lautner) snaps at Bella (Kristen Stewart) in the mawkish intermittently gory ""The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn -- Part 1"" ""and Im not sticking around to watch"" Tween audiences likely wont agree but really who can blame him? Poor Bella. All she ever wanted was to get into the pants of hottie vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) who once sat next to her in science class. But if theres a moral that teenage girls can take away from these films based on Stephenie Meyers wildly popular novels it is this Lust doesnt pay. Bellas been beaten bitten driven to suicidal depression and nearly murdered over the course of the past three films. She fares no better in ""Breaking Dawn -- Part 1"" when her first time with new husband Edward leaves her not only bruised from head to toe but impregnated with his demon spawn devouring her from the inside. Still it was a beautiful wedding. PHOTOS ""TWILIGHT"" STARS IN OTHER FILMS Director Bill Condon (""Kinsey"" ""Dreamgirls"") hits his stride at the films start with a satisfyingly lavish spectacle starring an awkward Bella teetering down the aisle in high heels (and trying not to dwell on her Boschian nightmare of the night before in which she and Edward leer over a wedding-cake-shaped pile of guests bloody bodies). Welcome bit players surface to give funny toasts. Bellas dad Charlie (Billy Burke) reminds his new son-in-law hes a cop who owns a gun; Anna Kendricks Jessica reveals an awesome high school nickname for Edward ""The Hair."" But it all goes wrong just when it should go right Bella and Edwards long long long-awaited honeymoon sex scene is the most anticlimactic deflowering since Jennifer Jason Leighs in ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" (an old-timers movie kids) One shot of Pattinsons muscular arms snapping the headboard in two and its the next morning at their Brazilian island villa. Bella doesnt even get a chance to enjoy the afterglow as Edwards already telling her how sorry he is to have roughed her up. ""Im not"" she says in an uncharacteristic display of not agreeing with everything he says. ""Dont ruin this for me."" Too late Because . . . shes late. Then everythings all soap-operatic close-ups and weirdly political hand-wringing. ""Well get that thing out"" Edward vows while Bella clutches her already-bulging stomach protectively. The rest of the Cullen family (Peter Facinelli Nikki Reed Kellan Lutz Ashley Greene and Jackson Rathbone) resurface and engage in a debate about whether to use the term ""fetus"" or ""baby."" (When their work is done here perhaps they can be dispatched to Mississippi.) Condons not doing anyone any favors with his relentlessly tight facial shots the hair and makeup budget for this film seems to have been reallocated to the humor department (there are actually a handful of intentional laughs in between the groaners). Reed and Facinelli in particular look like their wigs were left out in the rain in between movies. Good old Jacob the hotheaded werewolf Bella loves (but only as a friend) doesnt have much to do in this installment besides stomping around vowing to make someone pay for Bellas increasingly skeletal condition communing with his wolf pack in abysmal CGI and in the films absolutely creepiest moment ""imprinting"" on Bellas baby daughter which means shes his destined soul mate. As Bella -- very reminiscent of Mia Farrow in ""Rosemarys Baby"" -- sips a Styrofoam cup of O-negative and nears her due date Condon seems to regain his momentum. The films final bloody act which sees the birth of Bella and Edwards baby via vampire cesarean (its what you think) almost but not quite makes up for the past hour of overwrought living-room histrionics and muddled wolf-vampire skirmishes. Finally comes the moment weve all been waiting for Bella opens her eyes reborn as a vampire. But any real payoff -- seeing her get the chance to stop being such a darn pushover -- is delayed until next fall when ""The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn -- Part 2"" arrives in theaters. Pattinson who seems pretty well aware of how ridiculous this has all gotten sums it up nicely. ""Well"" Edward says to his emaciated blood-slurping bride ""they say the first year is the hardest"" Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Schwarzenegger banged up and bloodied during movie accid...

I just could not stand it. 0/4 stars F- Ramshasaid on Sunday February 05 2012 22311 AMIve never been a twilight fan. But Breaking Dawn had made me a die-hard fan of twilight series.And now... I cant wait to see its next part.. Veesaid on Thursday January 05 2012 92516 PMTwilight is excellent I am not a twilight fan but I loved Breaking Dawn. Sarasaid on Sunday November 27 2011 122727 PMI think we need to remember these movies are meant to be for the fans of the books..There are a lot of subtlety in this movie franchise as the book/movie are from Bellas prospective. If you didnt read them then you miss a lot of it. I know from the outside looking in these movies are a little much but whats shown is really as much as the fans allow no? If the director/screen writer change the film to not be exactly what the books are it would unfair to those who put so much of their time and energy into being twihards. All in all its a movie for the fans right? Zeiramsaid on Saturday November 26 2011 22544 PMFor being the kind of soap-opera like corny cast garbage they show on networks like the CW and stuff like that; these movies are Citizen Kane.

By Peter Rainer Film critic November 18 2011 Save for later Saved The plot with Bella (Kristen Stewart r.) getting pregnant tries for Rosemarys Baby goriness but without the imagination. Andrew Cooper/HONS/Summit Entertainment          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? In Pictures Twilight Breaking Dawn movie premiere And you thought maybe you were going to get the whole ""Twilight"" finale in one big package? ""The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn - Part 1"" is here to tell you otherwise. For those of us who are not ""Twilight"" fanatics or even fans or could not care somewhat less than less the arrival of ""Part 1"" is not cause for trumpets blaring. But I would imagine that even those who line up for this film will be somewhat let down if only because its clear that most of the juicy stuff will arrive in Part 2 - which wont be released until next November. ""Part 1"" has Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) marrying pasty-faced vampire hunk Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and forgoing abstinence. Result A fetal vampire takes up residence in her womb. This greatly displeases Bellas second-string hearthrob the wolfish Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner). For the most part director Bill Condon and his screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg working off the Stephenie Meyer mega-bestseller skimp on the vampires versus wolves smackdowns in favor of a kinder gentler luridness. ""Part 1"" is going for a ""Rosemarys Baby"" vibe but without much wit or imagination. Once Bella gets pregnant Condon keeps servingup shots of blood or something red at any rate coursing violently through her innards. I guess he was also going for a ""Fantastic Voyage"" vibe. Grade C- (Rated PG-13 for for disturbing images violence sexuality/partial nudity and some thematic elements.)

By Dana Stevens Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson in The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn Part 1 Still by Andrew Cooper/(c) 2011 Summit Entertainment LLC. All rights reserved. With its penultimate installment Twilight Breaking Dawn Part I (Summit Entertainment) the Twilight series finally spirals down into the psychosexual black hole its been circling for three films now. By any normal standard this is a terrible movie with stilted dialogue and leaden pacing--every 15 minutes or so the action stops for a musical montage involving slow-motion handsomeness. But the Twilight saga stopped being normal a long time ago and though its now a club reserved for members only--Im not sure a neophyte could make head or tail of this movies deep mythology--I confess a grudging respect for this franchises willingness to plumb the darker reaches of the teen female psyche. Breaking Dawn Part I (scripted like the last three movies by Melissa Rosenberg and directed this time by Bill Condon) is one seriously sick little blockbuster. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. When we last saw Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) and her vampire boyfriend Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) they had just gotten engaged--a radical step for a couple with an 87-year age difference (shes 18 hes 105). In this movies first big set piece they celebrate their wedding on his familys fabulously petal-strewn lawn. (It makes sense that vampires would excel as wedding planners with their super-strength super-speed and super-style.) At the start of the ceremony though Bella flashes on a fantasy of herself and Edward covered in blood standing on a heap of corpses the entire human half of their wedding party. Her fear is that if Edward grants her wish to be turned into a vampire shell destroy everyone else she loves. Bella and Edwards nuptials are further disrupted by the arrival of Jacob (Taylor Lautner) the teenage werewolf next door whos been licking his wounds (sorry) since Bella announced her engagement. Because Edward understands that Jacob and Bella share a special connection he drifts away to allow his wife of less than an hour to slow-dance in the woods with her lupine ex a gesture of masochistic self-sacrifice that may be the movies high point for Twilight triangulation fetishists. Jacob begs Bella to resist vampirization and stay human but she makes it clear that once they leave on their honeymoon she and Edward are going all the way. Advertisement But what is ""all the way"" for vampires? As I understand it (and please forgive my ignorance in these matters; Ive seen all the movies but couldnt make it past the first of Stephenie Meyers books) vampires in the Twilight universe have multiple options when it comes to humans. They can abstain from contact with them living instead on the blood of wild animals like Edwards classy coven elects to do. They can drink humans blood and leave them for dead. Or they can nearly kill them then use vampire venom to ""turn"" them at the last minute--the consummation that the love-struck Bella so devoutly desires. As Bella and Edward learn during their honeymoon on a private Brazilian island vampire-human relations can take another form as well. If the vampire in question is enough of a master of self-restraint (a quality the chaste Twilight series prizes very highly) he can ravish his bride the old-fashioned way without either killing or ""turning"" her. Edward and Bella only accomplish this once in a night of passion so intense they reduce a four-poster bed to a pile of lumber and drifting feathers. (The shot of Bella waking in the wreckage the morning after is one of several moments when the movie pokes fun at its own het-up silliness.) But one time is all it takes to get Bella impregnated with a fast-growing ""immortalicum""--a human/vampire half-breed that saps nutrients from its mothers body and shows up on ultrasound only as a black void. Its when Bella gets pregnant that things really start to go bonkers. Practically from the minute we learn shes knocked up Bellas body becomes a house of horrors. (The scene in which she gorges on peanut butter and undercooked chicken wondering why shes so hungry all of a sudden brought to mind Mia Farrow seeing her reflection in a toaster as she noshes on raw liver in Rosemarys Baby.) The host-destroying capacities of the demon spawn are such that within weeks its mother is reduced to an ashen near-skeleton barely capable of standing and walking on her own. (Kristen Stewarts already whippet-thin body was further whittled down by digital means--I hope.) Oh and Bella has to drink human blood out of a Styrofoam cup through a straw. And her pregnant belly--for some reason this skeeved me out most of all--is covered in strange bruises as if the baby were somehow beating her up from outside as well as in. The anxieties about female sexuality--and hell about mortal existence in a human female body--that pervade this films latter half are so numerous and intense that Breaking Dawn becomes interesting almost despite itself. In the age of glowing celebrities with their well-tended ""baby bumps"" theres something refreshingly unwholesome about this films dark fantasy of pregnancy as an invasion that destroys its host even as she welcomes it. The birth scene--which involves among other things an amateur C-section done sans anesthesia--is genuinely primally horrifying in a way no Twilight movie has been before. This vision of parturition as a form of demonic torture co-exists bizarrely enough with an abortion debate waged by the undead. Bella languishes on the couch with her hemoglobin smoothie as her vampire sisters-in-law Alice (Ashley Greene) and Rosalie (Nikki Reid) snipe at each other over what to call the thing Bella is carrying a ""fetus"" or a ""baby"" ""it"" or (as Bella herself insists) ""him."" The prospect of a vampire-human hybrid also causes alarm among the high vampire council known as the Volturi setting the scene for the intra-vampire wars to come in the last chapter. In the book I gather Breaking Dawns unplanned-vampire-pregnancy plotline is something of a Trojan horse for a conservative pro-life agenda Apparently immortal mutant vampire life also begins at conception. Here I wouldnt say thats a major factor (or if it is theres so much other allegorical weirdness in the air its hard to separate it out.) Breaking Dawn Part I is too scattered to have anything like an agenda; its incoherent and dopey and feverishly overdramatic like an annoying teenager who wont stop talking on the bus. But its also good-looking and promiscuously perverse and brimming over with an excess of life like the awesome teenager you once were yourself.

"Twilight Breaking Dawn Part One | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; twilight-breaking-dawn-part-one ) Twilight Breaking Dawn Part One (United States 2011) November 18 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli With the Twilight movies you get out of them what you put into them. If youre a fan this represents a delirious opportunity to see moments and characters from a favorite book come to life on the big screen. If youre indifferent to the hackneyed prose of Stephanie Meyer the Twilight movies come across as overlong rambling borderline camp permutations of Romeo and Juliet with vampires and werewolves. Theyre not unlike Pride and Prejudice and Zombies except (at least on some level) they take themselves seriously. That some devotees regard Breaking Dawn as the weakest of the series has not dissuaded Summit Entertainment in a naked money-grab from bifurcating the novel for its cinematic adaptation. Given the haphazard narrative structure of the book this does little to damage the integrity of the story but it demands two trips to the theater when one suspects one would have been more than sufficient. Breaking Dawn Part One is the movie in which the chastity belt of Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) finally comes off. She may be the last teenage virgin but that could have something to do with the nature of her beau Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). However in Stephanie Meyers reality not only can vampires give and have orgasms but they can impregnate. I think perhaps the key thing to note about the authors interpretation of the ""undead"" concept is that were not dealing with animated corpses empowered by the Devil; Meyers vampires are akin to an alien species that thrives on blood. Still the idea of Bella having hot bed-wrecking sex with Edward is more creepy than erotic which may be why the filmmakers elected to limit what the camera sees in the honeymoon suite. Director Bill Condon the art film darling lured to this big budget fiasco by a fat paycheck is not known for pulling punches which may explain rumors that the first cut of Breaking Dawn was destined for an ""R"" rating. Despite the undeniable fact that the movies graphic disturbing content warrants nothing less such a move would be a commercial disaster so the necessary cuts were made. Gone are chunks of the sex scene but not the childbirth sequence which pushes the envelope. The plot is threadbare and straightforward. Its all about Bella losing her virginity - the prelude the deed and the aftermath. As the movie opens shes preparing for her wedding. Its a low-key affair attended by humans vampires and a werewolf or two. The honeymoon and deflowering occur on an out-of-the-way island (somewhere in the general vicinity of Rio) which is where Bella discovers two weeks into her marriage that theres something growing inside of her. Vampire/human hybrids develop quickly in the womb and Bella is soon fighting for her life. The werewolf community upset by either a violation of the natural order or the breaking of a treaty (the movie is unclear on this point although Im sure readers of the book can enlighten me) decides to kill the baby after its birth. This leads to a little wolf-on-vampire action as the movie races toward its climax (not to be confused with the hardcore stuff in the Underworld movies). The pacing is uneven which is expected given the padding necessary to spread the story over two films. The first 80 minutes feels like a Dark Shadows-inspired melodrama with meaningless drivel standing in for angst-laden soul-searching dialogue. If Edward was Jewish he could be played by Woody Allen. The slow plodding tempo picks up considerably toward the end. Theres an unintentionally hilarious scene in which talking wolves debate who has the bigger... umm... teeth. The last reel battle which is intercut with a tragedy involving Bella is assembled masterfully (also credit Carter Burwells score). The final 30 minutes of Breaking Dawn represents good fun and makes up for a measure of the torture inflicted upon viewers getting to that point. One of the problems with the Twilight movies is they never aspire to anything more than a pre-teen romantic fantasy. I suppose thats the point but it gets old after a while. The subplots which feature cruel bloodsuckers cheesy-looking werewolves and vampire politics are forgettable and all were left with is endless romantic angst. Brooding Edward is generally sympathetic. Jacob (Taylor Lautner) is bipolar and immature. Bella is among the most self-absorbed romantic heroines to grace the screen in the last five years although she shows signs of maturity in this installment. Still Edward and Jacob should have run off together and left her standing at the altar. I refuse to discuss the acting at any length. Whats the point? It is what it is. Kristen Stewart once again forgets shes a talented capable performer and sleepwalks her way through the part although special effects do an effective job of giving her an anorexic corpse-like appearance during the pregnancy scenes. Robert Pattinson channels an undead version of James Dean and does his best to look more dashing and heroic than in the three previous Twilights. Taylor Lautner shows off his pecs (in his very first scene) but the best acting occurs when Jacob is being portrayed as a CGI wolf. There are familiar faces here and there - Anna Kendrick Billy Burke Maggie Grace (what happened to Dakota Fanning?) - but the Twilight supporting cast doesnt rank alongside the Harry Potter entourage when it comes to the cream of the crop. Bill Condon was brought on board after flirtations with Gus Van Sant and Sofia Coppola fell through. Condon brings a lot of indie cred and gets to toss in a delicious in-joke (note whats playing in the theater where Edward in flashback makes his first kill) but its hard to argue that his style is significantly different than that of his three Twilight predecessors. As in any franchise the material is bigger than the filmmaker and Condons contributions are small. Hes also either uncomfortable with special effects or wasnt given a sufficient budget because some of them (especially those featuring wolves) are awful. Breaking Dawn Part One ends on a perfect note. Its designed as a cliffhanger but since nearly everyone seeing the movie will have read the book theres not a lot of suspense. The one-year break is hard to justify - at least Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows waited only seven months in between segments. When assigning a grade the appropriate mark for Breaking Dawn Part One is an ""incomplete."" Without Breaking Dawn Part Two its difficult to say how the movie will fare when put in a larger context. Fans wont care but others might. As a stand-alone its a shaky affair more likely to please lovers of the books than anyone else. But since the Twilight films are made for the former group at the expense of the latter it will be successful. Heres hoping Breaking Dawn Part Two gives us more of what Part One provided in the final 30 minutes than what it forced viewers to endure to get there.

You either a) love the source material anticipate the films and dont want to hear any dissuasive nonsense; b) hate the source material loathe the films and dont want to hear any affirmative nonsense; or c) dont care either way. Its also the rare film in which everyone who is emotionally invested already knows whats going to happen the entire time with the pictures on-screen merely acting as a paint-by-numbers reenactment. In this manner its the most polarizing film of the year though there are three poles to be considered. Twi-polar if you will. Yep this is gonna be one of ""those"" sorts of missives. But lets start with the truly terrible aspects of The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn - Part One so that we can end on a positive note as there are a few bright spots to be found near the end. Not so with the outset of the film where were treated to an absolutely brutal wedding spectacle followed by an even worse ""bedroom"" scene on what seems to be the honeymoon of eternal cheese. At the beginning of the movie its not so much that The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn - Part One is tone-deaf as it is lacking any tone at all. How do we know Bella (Kristen Stewart) is beautiful? Because people tell her over and over that she is How do we know that Edward (Robert Pattinson) feels bad about her post-nuptial bruises? Because he broods like a teenager which is odd because hes over 100 years old. Youd have thought hed learned life is tough put on a happy face and all that jazz. But its not to be. It also must be noted that every single scene in the film has a song playing underneath. Sometimes overly expository with lyrics acting as vessels of conveyance where the actors stubbornly refuse to and at other times just to keep things moving along without any heavy lifting. Its as if they filmed dozens of scenes where nothing really happens then figured ""Well what if we just added a TON of music? Would it seem like a movie then?"" The answer is ""kind of."" It kind of seems like a movie. But scenes comprised entirely of facial expressions and alt rock dont work after the first 30 minutes or so and if they did the Oscar would have gone to Alicia Silverstones dynamic performance in ""Cryin"" long ago. The script also completely gives out at certain points. For instance after Jacob (Taylor Lautner) is schooled on a particularly important bit of alpha-werewolf mythos he shrugs and says ""Whatever."" Whatever indeed Jacob. Whatever indeed. Still there are nice moments too. The wedding toasts in the first act stand out as much-appreciated moments of levity and with no less an actor than Oscar nominee Anna Kendrick back in the fold. The closing credits of the film are also compelling and be sure to stick around for that end credits scene. Its a grabber. The werewolf CGI is also completely dialed in this time around; the wolves snarl and howl in a very legit manner. And though the final act is Juno meets a romance novel swirled around with True Blood the final 20 minutes are entertaining as all get out. Hard earned sure but the finale does work which is an accomplishment for a part one. The themes buried deep beneath the Velveeta are worth exploring. The birth of a potential monster the price of personal happiness the balance needed in any successful relationship -- these may have been the things The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn - Part One was attempting to explore. Not that they do and not that it will matter in terms of financial success or artistic appreciation from the intended demographic. If you dig Twilight youll find much to like here; if not not so much. It reminds one of a Lil Wayne lyric that sums up the entire franchise quite nicely ""If you aint running with it ... run from it"".

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 18 2011 1221AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 239PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Though there is probably no way to derail the financial juggernaut of the romantic vampire-themed Twilight movies - 1.8-billion and counting - the fourth and penultimate movie in the series is a significant let-down. The script adapted by Melissa Rosenberg from the first part of Stephanie Meyers fourth novel in the series was supposed to be climactic. Instead its the most jumbled and tonally confused movie yet. Robert Pattinson Kristen Stewart attend the UK premiere of The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn Part 1 at Westfield Stratford City on November 16 2011 in London England. an Gavan/Getty Images video Video Twilight fever hits London Sarah Clarke arrives at ""The Twilight Saga Eclipse"" premiere in Los Angeles June 24 2010. Tammie Arroyo / AP Celebrity Video Twilights Sarah Clarke discusses vampire film After the long slow tease of the previous three movies about the relationship between high school senior Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) and the handsome vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattison) things have now reached the point of consummation. Bella has agreed to marry him to finally have sex and to allow him to turn her from mortal to vampire. For good measure she gets pregnant on her honeymoon with a rapidly growing semi-vampire fetus in her uterus adding a whole new set of complications. Yet for all the dramatic potential director Bill Condon ( Dreamgirls Gods and Monsters) seems determined to make this the most talky and dawdling of all of the Twilight movies. The decision to split J. K. Rowlings final Harry Potter and the Deathly Harrows book into two movies while originally criticized proved amply justified by this summers concluding film. Its hard to see the same argument working here when so much of the film feels like padding a stitched together sequence of montages with an occasional pause for some expository dialogue. For ooh-and-ah audience impact theres an early shirtless scene of Taylor Lautner as the werewolf with a six-pack Jacob Black. Then theres a dreamy wedding that should work well with the fans Shot in a woodsy glade with tendrils of white flowers hanging from the trees it features Bella resplendent in a peekaboo lace gown its the stuff of fantasy come to life. That clocks in the first half-hour. Next the couple zip off to an island near Rio de Janeiro for their honeymoon though after a token shot of the statue of Christ the Redeemer and a street music festival most of the action takes place in a seaside villa. Somehow between the delicate initiation when Bella and Edward discretely skinny dip together to the next morning when the four-poster bed is in shambles and Bella is covered with bruises something exciting has happened but the couples continuing coy behaviour leaves us in the dark. Bella assures Edward that she cant imagine ""human"" sex thats better than their first night though its all too obvious she has no point of comparison. After the deed is done Bella and Edward moon and frolic to more insipid songs on the soundtrack as another half hour or two weeks in honeymoon time crawl by. Then Bella throws up her fried chicken lunch and discovers she has an unplanned demi-vampire in the oven. The pregnancy does not leave her with a maternal glow On the contrary she grows progressively more gaunt with her eyes hollow and skin discoloured while the beach ball in her belly expands alarmingly. Edward favours getting ""that thing"" out of her as soon as possible Bella insists on carrying the parasitic little monster full term (one shudders to imagine what breast feeding would be like). Meyers agenda isnt hard to discern If the earlier parts of the Bella-Edward story were a veiled exploration of teen abstinence the new film revolves around the abortion debate. Edward sulking that his ""choice"" has been taken away from him. Back in Bellas hometown in Washington State the glamorous vampire coven offer opinions pro and con. Meanwhile in the woods the werewolves (the CGI wolves have grown notably less convincing) the rivals have their own pregnancy-terminating plan in mind. While the last third offers a few moderately disgusting moments this feels more like camp than romantic horror. Lets hope the filmmakers have been saving their best for next years final episode. Otherwise Twilight fans may be left with the impression that those passionate and pretty young humans werewolves and vampires from the early films have been replaced by zombies.

Photo Credit Summit Entertainment advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW It didnt seem possible but the teen vampire soap-opera that has brought us so many good laughs over the years has reached new heights of comedy with ""The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn -- Part 1."" The previous three films in the franchise had a certain charm capturing the angst of adolescence with such earnestness that they became kind of adorable like a toddler in mid-tantrum. The new movie though is moving into grown-up territory with themes of marriage sex and childbirth. What remains is the total conviction that the ludicrous scenes are dead serious and fiercely meaningful. The result is not quite a laugh a minute but close. advertisement | advertise on newsday The films plot points are well-known partly because theyre so bizarre that many wondered how new director Bill Condon (""Dreamgirls"") would possibly film them. The story begins with mortal Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) and vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) tying the knot and finally becoming free to satisfy the urges theyve long denied. Even the ""Twilight"" fans at Wednesday nights screening chuckled when Edward literally broke the wedding bed. The laughter continued when a sickly-looking Bella gazed at her hideously mottled belly and said ""Its like this kind of miracle."" Another doozy is when Bella realizes she must drink human blood to feed the baby; Edward brings it in a plastic foam to-go cup. As for Edward doing a C-section with his teeth -- how is this not supposed to be funny? Condon handles some scenes with tenderness (Billy Burke is once again touching as Bellas dad) but surely any director knows theres something hilarious about ordering Taylor Lautner as hunky werewolf Jacob Black to remove his shirt within the films opening six seconds. Either way this first part of the sagas two-part finale promises more hilarity to come.

Andrew Cooper/Summit Entertainment hide caption toggle caption Andrew Cooper/Summit Entertainment The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn (Part 1) Director Bill Condon Genre Adventure Drama Fantasy Running Time 117 minutes Rated PG-13; disturbing images violence sexual/partial nudity and some thematic elements With Kristen Stewart Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner If you were to run into the ghost of Sigmund Freud on your way out of The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn Part 1 my guess is hed tell you he found the symbolism a little on the nose. In fact to put it in the dry scholarly language that the father of psychoanalysis might use Breaking Dawn is where the Twilight series goes straight-up cuckoopants. Up until this point its been an overwrought teenage love triangle with a sprinkling of gothic elements filled with brooding and sparkling and the occasional vampire-werewolf Brawl For It All. But here we enter the kingdom of the verifiably bonkers where the subtext becomes text the psychosexual horror-show takes flight and we learn once and for all that Bella Swan wants nothing more than to be well and truly devoured from the inside out. This we are given to understand is the only way she will ever know real love. But it starts with a wedding. When we join them vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and human Bella (Kristen Stewart) are in the final stages of event planning which is always a stressful time even if you and your groom have compatible DNA. Werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner) now relegated to the role of loser stomps around snorting. (Lautner is a master thespian of the nostrils though it must be said that he does gamely attempt later in the film to make lemonade out of a scene that cannot be explained without the phrase ""Well when a teen wolf and a baby love each other very much ..."") Watch Clips From The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn - Mrs. Cullen Mrs. Cullen Credit Summit Entertainment From The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn - Vampire Baby Vampire Baby Credit Summit Entertainment From The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn - A Great Service A Great Service Credit Summit Entertainment Around this time we learn that while Bella still wishes to be transformed into a vampire she doesnt intend to do so until after the honeymoon. This leads Jacob and Edward to have -- right in front of Bella -- the most awkward confrontation in the history of awkward confrontations in which Bellas new husband and her jealous ex face off over whether the sheer power of her husbands affection will kill her on her wedding night. Little does Jacob know that the better conversation would have focused less on vigor in the bridal suite and more on the importance of birth control; it seems that Edward who offers an antenuptial confession to a past as a murderous bloody-mouthed menace has somehow managed to live for more than a hundred years and graduate from a gaggle of high schools without understanding where babies come from. Yes the central story of this half of Breaking Dawn is Bellas pregnancy which doesnt quite go as planned. Her maternal musings on her oncoming offspring are less the typical ones about what gender it will be and more the less-typical ones about what species it will be. (As the old wives tale says if youre carrying low its a zombie.) It will turn out that the wee one is just sitting in there in an impenetrable sac turning Bella into an emaciated gray-skinned hag determined to sacrifice herself so that her tiny monster can be born -- or more precisely can exit by whatever means necessary be they traditional surgical or ... dental. i Hes still around? We are duty-bound to report that Jacob (Taylor Lautner) is still part of a plot that grows increasingly preposterous not that that will matter in the least. Andrew Cooper/Summit Entertainment hide caption toggle caption Andrew Cooper/Summit Entertainment Hes still around? We are duty-bound to report that Jacob (Taylor Lautner) is still part of a plot that grows increasingly preposterous not that that will matter in the least. Andrew Cooper/Summit Entertainment Theres a sense in which this is the most enjoyable Twilight chapter ever in which author Stephenie Meyer takes the boring solemnity her heavy writing has always insisted on and throws it into a food processor with a few cups of Fangoria a scoop of I Didnt Know I Was Pregnant and three tablespoons of Ripleys Believe It Or Not What comes out is utterly joyless lifeless and pointless but its somewhat more audaciously so than the earlier films. Director Bill Condon (who directed and wrote the Oscar-winning screenplay for Gods and Monsters) may not have a light hand here but he fully commits to a few bizarre plot elements that many expected would disappear from a Hollywood adaptation. On the other hand However wet-blanket it may seem to say so the more this series embraces its identity as a dance of abusive emotional grotesques the more bothersome its themes become. Entertainment is entertainment; fun is fun; Edwards and Jacobs stalker-like possessiveness and Bellas lack of agency are well-covered territory by now. But when a saga popular with pre-adolescent girls peaks romantically on a night that leaves the heroine to wake up covered with bruises in the shape of her husbands hands -- and when that heroine then spends the morning explaining to her husband that shes incredibly happy even though he injured her and that its not his fault because she understands he couldnt help it in light of the depth of his passion -- thats profoundly irresponsible. Yes were all having a good yuk over the unhinged quality of it all. And yes its a movie with a monster baby. (And an angry argument among a pack of wolves thats about as menacing as an outtake from Oliver amp; Company.) But romanticizing an intimate relationship that leaves bruises and scars is a particularly terrible idea in a film aimed at girls. Talking about this is tiresome but then so is putting it in the movie. From depicting the loss of virginity as a naturally violent frightening physically dangerous experience to making Bella a woman with no life at all outside of her literally all-consuming pregnancy the narrative sledgehammers are all as distasteful as they are inelegant. You know what this is. You wont be surprised if youve read the books. This is a descent into madness of a particularly gruesome kind.  ""Team Dad"" if youre wondering.

Twilight actors are feeling the love from fans Showtimes for The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn Part 1 Breaking down the Breaking Dawn soundtrack What challenged Breaking Dawn director Bill Condon? Pop Culture blog More Twilight I know that nothing I can say will dissuade the true Twilight fans among you from seeing the fourth in the movie franchise Breaking Dawn -- Part 1. But -- and Im speaking as a fan of the last film Eclipse which had good acting and a strong storyline -- here is my heartfelt recommendation for this one Buy your tickets. Go have dinner maybe do some holiday shopping. Creep into the theater for the last half-hour and youll leave satisfied.If you insist on seeing the entire seemingly never-ending 117 minutes though youre going to spend at least 87 of those minutes bored out of your mind.Quick plot summary to this point in the saga Mortal teen Bella (Kristen Stewart) falls in love with immortal vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson). Then she wavers feeling fondly toward her werewolf buddy Jacob (Taylor Lautner who once again raises every scene hes in by several levels of believability and emotional weight). She finally decides on Edward. No consummation of either relationship though.Cut to Breaking Dawn Bella and Edward marry. On the honeymoon wild sex ensues; in the world of writer Stephenie Meyer on whose novels the saga is based premarital sex is a big no-no but married vampire sex is peachy-keen. We know its wild because the bed and bedclothes are shredded come morning; the actual sex scene is ultra-mild.Then almost instantly Bellas pregnant. And the baby perhaps a week along is moving around. Uh-oh. What follows is the most horrific pregnancy ever put on film. Poor Bella loses her glow to a starving-fashion-model look thats not at all fetching. As he frets Edward loses his sparkle. Even Jacobs tan starts to look a little wan.Finally finally things get interesting when Jacobs wolf-pack decides Bellas baby-vampire-thingy must die. Jacob must decide whether to protect Bella or stay with his home-wolves. Edward frets some more about whether to turn Bella into a vampire. Will having Thingy kill her? Will it come out with fangs? Those questions make the ending thrilling and tense.It actually made me look forward to Part 2 set for November 2012 release. If the movie follows the book Thingy becomes even more attention-grabbing as it grows up. Maybe thatll keep our minds off its entirely sparkle-free parents. Uncle Jake though we want to see again.THE TWILIGHT SAGA BREAKING DAWN -- PART 1C+ Starring Kristen Stewart Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner. Directed by Bill Condon. PG-13 (for disturbing images violence sexuality/partial nudity and some thematic elements). 117 mins.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Start hating me now Twihards but the sexless bloodless padded and plodding Breaking Dawn Part 1 is the worst Twilight movie to date. (I dont get it either.) In the final novel of Stephenie Meyers megabestselling Twilight series the plot is crowded with incident. Human girl Bella (Kristen Stewart) finally marries Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) the vampire of her virgin dreams. They honeymoon in South America and have bed-crashing sex that results in Bella getting knocked up with a half-vampire baby that practically rips her body in half to get out of her belly in a grisly childbirth scene that nearly kills her except that Edward turns her into a vamp just in time. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Whew And thats just the first half of the book. By cutting Breaking Dawn into two movies the studio can bleed more bucks out of the audience especially those Twimoms who dote even more than their swooning daughters on the forbidden love Bella has for Edward and her wolf friend Jacob (Taylor Lautner). Unless you think the studio is just in it for art like the Kardashians. Anyway I harbored hopes since both Breaking Dawn movies (Part 2 materializes next November) are directed by Twi-newbie Bill Condon a first-rate director of indisputable talent (see Gods and Monsters Kinsey and Dreamgirls). But Condon is helpless before the ravening banality of Melissa Rosenbergs screenplay which substitutes timidity for risk at every turn. Even good actors expire under the films cheeseball cloud. As for Lautner acting is not one of his gifts so the movie opens with him going shirtless. Oy.

Summit Entertainment Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart in ""Twilight Breaking Dawn"" (Summit Entertainment) The downside to being a vampires wife is revealed early in ""Breaking Dawn - Part 1.""A paranormal romance ""The Twilight Saga"" has been building through three movies to the union of human Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) and her vampire swain Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson).The lovely 18-year-old virgin knows shes in for some challenges - learning to prefer fresh animal blood to grilled sirloin for instance. But couldnt she at least be allowed to enjoy the pretty wedding and 5-star honeymoon digs? Alas no. The honeymoon is over almost before it starts.Bella despite assuring Edward shes not ""getting cold feet"" approaches a woodland walk up the aisle and her longed-for wedding night with tiresome trepidation.Panicky Bella does look pretty in her gown with its long sleeves plain front and peek-a-boo lace back. But the mixed-message dress is only one symbol of the contortions author Stephenie Meyer has gone through imagining a world in which chaste and courtly paranormal suitors protect the life and virtue of an average 21st-century teen.In a quick cameo during the wedding scene guest Meyer smiles at Bella as the bride nervously begins her walk down the aisle. Humorous toasts and Bellas introduction to new relatives relieve some of the tension.But as ""Twilight"" readers know just because the attractive pair are vampire and wife doesnt mean they can safely consummate their marriage. Guilt and sexual tension torment the honeymooners and the couple is soon punished for their physical love Bella realizes shes pregnant. A few minutes of passion and a fast-growing monster fetus threatens her life.There is little to enjoy in ""Breaking Dawn"" which might have worked better if producers had been satisfied to turn Meyers book into a single movie to finish the series. Director Bill Condon may have been hampered by the original material but he does nothing to help it along. Special effects range from ludicrous to repulsive as pregnant Bella turns gray and gaunt. The bloody birth scene may successfully push hundreds of hormonal teens to a new vow of celibacy.As Jacob Taylor Lautner is the only major character who brings warmth and energy to his role. But Condons dopey direction subverts not just pleasure in the romance but also the action. In one ludicrous scene Jacobs wolf pack snarls at one another while the bickering voices of their human characters seem to hover overhead.Twilight fans who have followed the series will want to see ""Breaking Dawn"" and like Bella and Edward may find brief moments of pleasure. But a few in the audience may howl along with the wolves.The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn - Part 1Two stars (out of four)  Rating PG-13  Run time 155   Content Disturbing images violence sexuality/partial nudity and some thematic elements.

But she forges ahead with the wedding a fantasia of lacy wisteria creamy chiffon fondant icing and premonitions of blood. Slideshow Twilight Breaking Dawn Premiere Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn - Part 1 >> The fever dream that is Bill Condons The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn - Part 1 swoony to the point of delirium announces its intentions in an extended opening sequence in which Virgin weds Vampire. It is not overstating the case to say that what The Lord of the Rings represents to young men Twilight represents for young women. One is a heroic quest the other a heroinic one that links sex and death with undying love. I enjoyed it immensely even while occasionally snickering at dialogue so wheezy it should come with an inhaler. Think of Breaking Dawn Part 1 as an extension of Condons Gods and Monsters his haunting film about the erotic obsessions of filmmaker James Whale who directed Frankenstein. Call this intoxicating brew with equal parts Bride of Frankenstein and Rosemarys Baby Goddess and Monsters. The goddess of course is Bella. The monsters are Edward her romantic and sexual soul mate and Jacob (Taylor Lautner) the werewolf who runs platonic interference. Shot mostly in extreme close-ups that caress the faces of its attractive mortally conflicted characters the film sympathetically details Bellas journey from girlhood to womanhood giving substance to her emotional turmoil. If by several lengths it is the best of the Twilight movies it is because it has the best story to tell. What does it mean to leave her human family of origin for that of the Cullen family an improvised vampire clan that preys on animals rather than people? How can she retain her own identity while merging body and soul with a most attractive specimen of the Undead? Will sex with the Other be dangerous or fun? (The PG-13 film suggests both the agony and the ecstasy The morning after the four-poster resembles a pile of matchsticks and Bella the Mona Lisa.) Is pregnancy a loss of self or a womanly fulfillment even if the spawn is the demon seed? Will ""changing"" Bella into a vampire a metamorphosis that Edward is reluctant to effect alter what he most loves about her? In his work with the hugely gifted Stewart Condon treats these questions without irony or shame and with occasional humor. ""Childhood is the kingdom where nobody dies"" muses Bella quoting the poem by Edna St. Vincent Millay as she prepares to marry her vampire swain to embark on the voyage to the adult kingdom of the Undead. The film haloed with fairy-tale light woodlands and forests (enchanted images courtesy of Pans Labyrinth cinematographer Guillermo Navarro) speaks directly to the unconscious. Will Condons movie convert agnostics to Stephenie Meyers Twilight cult? As with the later Harry Potter movies Breaking Dawns backstory and conventions are so dense that penetrating them is a challenge to newbies. Still the films tight focus on a young womans passage from pubescence to maturity is universal enough to be clear as Condons visual storytelling. Worthy of mention is Carolina Herreras design for Bellas wedding dress sophisticated and demure in the front and Pippa Middleton sexy and proper in the back. Likewise composer Carter Burwells low-key score (similar to his soundtrack for Condons Kinsey) which eloquently communicates Bellas exhilaration and her dread.

"Breaking Dawn a Part 1 review Vampire tale is lifeless - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-VampireBreaking Dawn a Part 1 review Vampire tale is lifelessSure the weddings great but the latest installment of the Twilight saga fails to address major issues that made the book engaging.November 18 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Kristen Stewart left and Robert Pattinson in a scene from ""Twilight... (Summit Entertainment )It breaks my heart to tell you that ""Breaking Dawn"" is broken. The movie thats carved out of the first half of the last book of Stephenie Meyers vampires-in-love series starring Kristen Stewart Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner is weighted down by more than its title to say nothing of the expectations. For the record its called ""The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn a Part 1"" as if 5 billion insanely attentive Twihards wouldnt be able to find it. Maybe the studio suits have begun to believe the franchise like the classy Cullen clan is immortal that almost nothing can kill it. Theyd better hope that last bit is true because ""Breaking Dawn"" kinda sucks in the metaphoric rather than the vampiric sense. The film doesnt have nearly the bite a ferocious or delicious a that any self-respecting vampire movie really should. Its as if all the life has drained away. PHOTOS Love triangles of TV and film Yes there is the wedding of the century and no it wasnt Kim and whats-his-names. With high school behind her Bella (Stewart) can marry her stone cold hottie Edward (Pattinson) finally putting an end to Jacobs (Lautner) werewolf dreams of winning her heart. The wedding is one of the best things about this installment a a slow tease building up to the big reveal a and not easy to do with any drama because lets face it anyone who has even a passing interest in ""Twilight"" or walks by a magazine rack knows its all about the wedding. (Again not Kims.) With Bill Condon directing and Bellas sister-in-law-to-be Alice (Ashley Greene) doing all the wedding planning it is an exquisite elegant exceedingly tasteful affair. What is it about vampires that they always have such high-end style? Something in the blood? I ask because if so the Red Cross should siphon some of its stash run ads in Architectural Digest and develop another revenue stream. But I digress. So the wedding is superb in its execution the filmmakers allowing plenty of time to savor it. Still Id really hoped for more that just a well-polished look from Condon. With his ""Dreamgirls"" and ""Gods and Monsters"" background he seemed a perfect fit for the final chapters of the tale of this dream girl and her godless monster. Such a pity. The couple say their ""I dos"" a little till-death-do-us-part irony. And right about now is when the films unplanned meta-story starts kicking in in ways that are a little distracting a little weird. If youve kept up with the glossy celebrity magazines since the first ""Twilight"" movie in 2008 you know that Stewart and Pattinson have been a couple on and off almost from the beginning. And if you believe the tabloids and if photos dont lie and I surely do and they surely dont Pattinson is the more smitten of the pair. So watching Edward watch Bella walk down that aisle the adoration in his eyes the relief when she says ""yes"" the kiss that seals their union a quite honestly it doesnt seem like acting per se (if it is then its one of his best performances). And I wont even go into the whole honeymoon night sequence or the way the actors on-screen ""chemistry"" is being marketed or the mixed-messages it sends to girls about their first sexual experience. But thats not the films real problem. What Meyer did so brilliantly in the book (or at least really really well) and what Melissa Rosenbergs script fails to do is to mine all the dramatic potential of the symbolic implications of immortality. The book gives over quite a few of its 756 pages to Bellas struggle with the high price of dying to live forever especially for her parents and Edwards guilt about it. And there is barely a mention of the provocative abortion debate a should the vampire-human hybrid created during the honeymoon be ""removed"" before it kills Bella? For conflict were left with Bella in a few moments of contemplation and consternation a which requires very little from Stewart an actress capable of so much more. The rest of the tension building is left up to Jacob and his werewolf issues. He goes postal when the wedding invitation arrives hackles raised lots of growling disappearing for days so thats a real nail-bitera| For those keeping score ""Breaking Dawn"" is missing the interesting indie edge that director Catherine Hardwicke brought to the first film. It does not flat line as badly as the second ""New Moon"" which would have died without the werewolves bite. It loses the brief emotional uptick of No. 3 ""Eclipse"" which saw the cast blossom into actual actors. So in the ""Twilight"" pantheon ""Breaking Dawn Part 1"" is at best a draw. Hopefully theyll fix whats wrong before next years finale because I really cant take another broken heart. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESKristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson walk Twilight red...November 12 2012Twilights tent city Hundreds of campers await L.A...November 12 2012Ashley Greene focuses on fans amid The Twilight Saga stormAugust 3 2012The Region  Twi-hards ready for New Moon premiere...November 15 2009Meyer watches as her vampires riseNovember 21 2008MORE STORIES ABOUTVampireTwilight SagaAshley GreeneCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-twilight-breaking-dawn-20111118,0,3241133.story?track=rss",200,thetwilightsagabreakingdawnpart119,thetwilightsagabreakingdawnpart1,latimes
"New Twilight film isnt great but it fulfills its task |       NJ.com comments New Twilight film isnt great but it fulfills its task Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on November 17 2011 at 438 PM updated November 17 2011 at 442 PM View/Post Comments Andrew CooperKristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson star in aThe Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn a Part 1a the latest but not last in the hit vampire-romance series. The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn -- Part 1"" is very good at being a Part 1 movie. Which unfortunately is not the same thing as being a very good movie. Thats because the first halves of two-part films are always all about the heavy lifting. Introduce new characters suggest fresh conflicts set some subplots in motion. And then just as things pick up ... See you next year Studios say fans force that solution because they want to see every word of their favorites on-screen; I say that if Hollywood can craft single films out of massive works by Shakespeare and Dickens they should manage to abridge a young-adult book about Northwest vampires or English wizards. But who wants to? Particularly when you can ride two separate waves of ticket sales and merchandising? So here comes ""Breaking Dawn -- Part 1"" with a big to-do list to check off before selling us Part 2. Give Bella and Edward a wedding Twihard brides are going to be copying for a decade. Send them on a honeymoon so we can finally get some (tastefully shot) boudoir hijinks. Give Bella the worst pregnancy since Rosemary was bedeviled. Director Bill Condon dutifully does all that -- and occasionally has some fun too. A fan of old-style horror -- and the director of ""Gods and Monsters"" a wry musing on filmmaker James Whale -- he gives us a flashback of Edward as a 30s vampire sitting in a theater watching Whales ""The Bride of Frankenstein."" Theres also a good montage of wedding toasts and a wink or two at the series own conventions (knowing fans are just waiting for Lautner to take off his shirt Condon gets it over with fast -- the way Hitchcock used to cram his cameos in early). Of course Lautner still has only one expression -- surly incomprehension. (If a thought ever crossed his mind it would have to pack a lunch.) But Robert Pattinson has a couple of good scenes and Kristen Stewart fully commits to looking awful as a pregnant mom. (You can imagine the anti-glam actress demanding they make her look worse.) Whats missing is some of the emotion along with the usual tricky questions of gender roles feminine power and chastity. That was powerful stuff and with all these repressed characters constantly talking about a fate (literally) worse than death the series sometimes felt like a wonderful silent melodrama. This film though seems to avoid any subtext -- a curious choice as the central story is about a mother refusing to consider an abortion even though the pregnancy is killing her. Instead its all about moving the pieces around as if -- like the honeymooning Edward and Bella -- it were playing another game of chess. This knight is sacrificed. That pawn advances. And lots of pale pretty people stare off into space while lots of other pale pretty people whine on the soundtrack. So in the end its a bad news-good news kind of picture. The bad news? Every ""Twilight"" fan will have to see it just to keep up. The good news? Now that all of the tedious exposition has been gotten glacially out of the way ""Part II"" will probably be terrific. Ratings note The film contains sexual situations and violence. The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn -- Part 1 (PG-13) Summit (117 min.) Directed by Bill Condon. With Kristen Stewart Robert Pattinson Taylor Lautner. Now playing in New Jersey.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet As we reach the penultimate installment of Stephenie Meyers Twilight saga its worth taking a moment to reflect on how spectacularly around the bend this popular supernatural psychomelodrama has gone. In Breaking Dawn--Part 1 assorted characters fall in love with a newborn jaunt off to private islands they happen to own off the coast of Brazil get volume boosts to their hair thanks to becoming undead lose their virginity in a life-threatening fashion and experience a possibly demonic accelerated pregnancy not necessarily in that order. In directing these final films Bill Condon (Dreamgirls) has created something thats half shameless wedding fantasia and half David Cronenberg-worthy body horror. It may be impossible for anyone but existing fans to take this seriously but for the unconverted its still a legitimately engaging gape-worthy nutso spectacle. Starting right where the last film left off with minimal exposition Breaking Dawn--Part 1 finds Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) finally giving in to one of the marriage proposals the male characters have been pitching at her since the series outset. The nuptials are a froth of rose petals and awkward toasts and even Jacob (Taylor Lautner) the lupine corner of the Twilight love triangle manages to set aside his shirtless heartbreak and make an appearance for a dance out in the woods. Then our heroine and Team Edward (Robert Pattinson) head off to honeymoon in South America where they break a bed while consummating their relationship and conceiving an impossible baby news of which enrages the werewolves. In spite of wall-to-wall music that seems like an apology for the dialogue (morning after ""Last night was the best night of my existence"") Condon actually finds some warm human moments. Pattinson laughs Stewart has a nervous bathroom freakout on her wedding night and gives her legs a last-minute shave And then the film segues into a section presumably intended to scare teens away from pregnancy as the vamp fetus grows and drains Stewart to a digitally enhanced emaciated state as it crushes her ""from the inside out."" Where Twilight started as a ""true love waits"" metaphor it makes in this segment a grotesquely unconvincing argument for maternal martyrdom in the form of taking a baby to term even if it kills the mother. But thats overthinking things. Breaking Dawn is best regarded as the purest-grade example of what the series has always at its heart been a cracked-out paranormal soap opera.

On film Kristen Stewart beautifully underplays (or for all I know overplays to the absolute peak of her abilities) Bellas deadpan ordinariness rubbing uncomfortably against the physical perfection and remote coolness of the Cullen vampire clan. Theres real interest in seeing that slightly morose slightly angry young woman interact with the sparkling mannequins around her.Unfortunately in Bill Condons Breaking Dawn-Part 1 Bella gets turned. Thats not to say she becomes a vampire necessarily--though you might recall that in the previous Twilight film Eclipse she pursued undeath with steely determination--but that in marrying Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) she becomes truly one of them. Maybe it was the enormous wedding with benches carved from tree trunks or the private jet or the villa on the Cullens Brazilian island. When the local housekeepers gawked at Bella lounging on an immaculate leather sofa I thought well shit Bella Swans no longer one of us. She has joined the vampires in the 1 percent.Yes Bella and Edward marry in Breaking-Part 1. And they do it. And Bella gets pregnant with some kind of Miracle-Gro demon spawn that breaks her ribs from the inside. Thats just the beginning of the shit show that is Condons film barely adapted by Melissa Rosenberg from the first half of the last book of Meyers series. Condon delivers the most authoritatively directed Twilight film so far which only brings into sharp relief how tonally incoherent its story is. In 117 minutes Breaking Dawn lurches from erotic awakening to sex farce to body horror--three genres Condon seems to have discovered not made for PG-13. Coming off worst is the films climax a bloody gruesome sequence that begged the question of how it might be filmed from the instant Meyer wrote it. The answer teasingly clumsily and not nearly bloodily gruesome enough.First though theres the debate between Bella and most of the Cullens about whether to get rid of whats growing inside of her. Expect much to be written about this and for op-ed hacks on either side of the debate to squeeze Breaking Dawn for all its worth; the films actual politics are muddy. Bella whos willing to have the baby even though itll certainly kill her could best be described as anti-life while the vampires trying to strong-arm her might be pro-abortion but theyre pretty determinedly anti-choice. (""Carlisle will know how to get that thing out of you"" Edward growls.) Suffering from some kind of hellish preeclampsia--her body its explained is rejecting the fetus--an increasingly cadaverous Bella stares listlessly at the X-rays and ultrasounds which in the films most affecting visual reveal an empty black hole where the baby should be.Breaking Dawns plot points--and there are only four in total--are separated by long montages and music-video sequences. The padding is at its most brutally obvious when were treated to a long sequence covered by three separate cameras of Jacob (Taylor Lautner) walking up a staircase turning at the landing walking up another staircase turning at the landing and walking up a third and final staircase. Yet whole characters and subplots are shoved to the side never to be seen again; Im almost certain that one vampire played by Jackson Rathbone utters but a single word. (""Possibly."") Breaking Dawn is both overlong and understuffed. I lived a thousand lifetimes watching it and died a thousand deaths. (The worst one was when Edward looked up ""immortalicum"" on Yahoo search. On Yahoo search)For the teens of all ages who are Twilights true audience the movie will serve Im sure. For parents--dragged willingly or unwillingly into the theater to be buffeted by screams and sighs and hormones buzzing like a power line--the real horror of Breaking Dawn-Part 1 comes as we see Bellas parents (played warmly by Sarah Clarke and Billy Burke) watch their girl disappear. They seem to know that the Cullens are no average in-laws and that once Bella becomes part of that family shell cease--in a way that parents fear deep inside will be the case but rarely in real life is--to be a part of her own. Burkes expression during the wedding is that of a man passing a stone and I teared up a bit for the first time ever in a Twilight film when walking down the aisle Bella asked him not to let her fall and he replied ""Never.""When Bella and Edward kiss at the altar youll hear applause in your theater but not at first in the film. Condon 360s the camera around the newly married couple to reveal their own private world friends and family gone those artisanal benches empty covered in vines. I cant be the only father of daughters who saw that and felt for a moment a stab of sorrow--that one day Ill be gone from my daughters lives and also that before that happens Ill probably have to watch this fucking movie again.

Good MSNBC Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture The worlds most insipid young lovers Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) finally consummate their love in Breaking Dawn--Part 1 the fourth installment in the Twilight series. This is cause for celebration only because it means our death march through the movie adaptations of Stephenie Meyers twisted but steadily puritanical saga is finally nearing its end. I wish I could report it was worth the wait but the paparazzi pictures of Pattinson and Stewart nuzzling are sexier than this. After Edward and Bella mutter their vows to each other in the woodsy garden of the Cullen mansion the duo departs for a honeymoon on a Brazilian island. There is an ongoing debate over exactly how theyll fare in the all-white marital bed. Bellas discarded swain Jacob (Taylor Lautner) the gentle werewolf voices his concerns about their having sex before Bella has been turned into a vampire. ""Youll kill her"" he says to Edward as if a vampire penis were a 300-horse-powered drill. But Bella demurs; the conversion process from human to vamp is agonizing. ""I dont want to spend my honeymoon writhing in pain."" Ahem. She does end up bruised after giving up her maidenhood and no wonder -- Edward clutches the bedstead in pleasure and it crunches like Styrofoam (or a cheesy set) beneath his fingers. But everything we see is tame firmly in the territory of artfully tangled sheets. Director Bill Condon (Dreamgirls Gods and Monsters) delivers soap-opera-style sex -- the kisses are dry the caresses sweat-free yet still he cuts away discreetly like a blushing schoolgirl. (LIST The Top 10 Sweatiest Movies) Bella is game for more. ""I think we did amazing"" she says in the morning. Fussy Edward valiantly vows not to put out again until Bella has been turned. They play chess instead moving red and white pieces around the board instead of enjoying a piece of each other. He resolutely ignores how cute she looks in lingerie. In one hilarious bit he eyes her lacy rump then pulls the covers over it. Young people of the world Sex is nothing like this The die is cast though; their unplanned demon child is already growing within her gestating at a rate so speedy it might make a cat jealous. There are many things about Meyers fantasy universe that drive me crazy but her constant sidestepping of accepted vampire lore comes close to topping the list. The most flagrant violation of standard vampire behavior is the revelation that they can impregnate a human (in Joss Whedons television series Angel one vampire gets another vampire pregnant another stretch but at least it was supernatural all the way around). See this is what happens when you dont practice safe sex; even the undead can knock you up. This is Meyers worst offense -- her disturbingly Victorian attitudes about sex and love which this movie falls modestly in lockstep with even though it concludes years of cinematic foreplay. Twilight came out in 2008 but it feels like weve been waiting a decade for these two to get past first base. I know its too late in the game to get all hot and bothered about the basic premise. But there are so many scenes of people standing around doing nothing and posing ridiculously like models in a commercial for high-end jeans that I had time to reflect on both the petty (like how peculiar Bellas gown is ill-fitting spandex in the bodice Priscilla of Boston lace panels in the back) and the perverse. This is the stuff of gothic novels the heroine swayed by the terrible beastly maleness of her lover a sexual act that hovers on rape in its sense of terror. Bella relinquishes control sexual pupil to Edwards century-old rake while he wakes up in the morning full of mopey self-loathing (""How badly are you hurt?""). Maybe Meyer never got over her own teenage Georgette Heyer phase. There is also something extraordinarily deflating about realizing that you are sitting among a throng of blissful fans content with such a static enterprise. If it werent for the gifted Anna Kendrick as Bellas best human friend (""I just thought it would bigger"" she says of the cake) and Bellas dad Charlie (Billy Burke) the movies would feature nothing but unintentional humor. As Bellas belly grows the Cullen clan gathers around plying her with cashmere throws and cups full of O Negative (this fetus has no interest in ice cream or pickles). But theyre helpless. Whats in there? ""Its just a little baby"" one of the indistinguishable girl Cullens says. ""Possibly"" hisses one of the boy Cullens. Even doctor ""dad"" Carlisle (Peter Facinelli) doesnt know what to do. The superhuman baby is sucking his mother dry -- the already skinny Stewart looks like deaths head here. Lets hope her skeletal frame owes something to CGI. Edward is in favor of a late-term abortion in order to save his lady love but as usual shes stubborn. No matter that a war is brewing between the Quileute ""dogs"" and the vamps over the undead unborn. She loves the baby. And as the birth approaches in a bit of remarkable vampire technology Edward is able to communicate with the fetus Cullen and learn this wonderful tidbit ""He loves you Bella."" There has been much speculation over how the birth sequence would be handled. Even die-hard Meyer fans admit to being freaked out by how bloody and weird it is on the page with fangs replacing surgical instruments. On the screen it is a rapidly cut sequence of ketchup and interior views of veins less horrifying than bizarre and like the sex oddly anticlimactic. In the final installment due next November Bella will be a mother and a vampire but since the Twilight movies are the most remote tale of love sex and reproduction ever put to film the chances that Breaking Dawn--Part 2 will be anything worth sinking your teeth into are as slim as Bella Swan.

And while all of them concocted tasty desserts packed with actual creme none of them could completely duplicate the mass-produced injection-filled icon of junk food. With ""The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn Part 1"" the Twinkie wins. The hiring of talented filmmaker Bill Condon (""Dreamgirls"") has no doubt resulted in the best ""Breaking Dawn Part 1"" that we were ever going to get. But even with this craftsman (and horror stylist) at the helm were still stuck with author Stephenie Meyers ludicrous storytelling and one-note characters and a principal cast that mistakes not-blinking for soulful depth. Also read Twilight Money How Summit Plans to Make 1.2B Off Breaking Dawn Not that any of this will matter in the slightest of course to the Twi-hards who have eagerly drunk the Edward-and-Bella Kool-Aid; theyre lucky to have a director of Condons caliber seeing the story through to its climax. Both climaxes and drinking the Kool-Aid incidentally are on the agenda for Bella (Kristen Stewart) who begins the film teetering in her first pair of pumps and preparing to tie the knot with her undead paramour Edward (Robert Pattinson). While wolfboy Jacob (Taylor Lautner) the other guy who loves Bella is upset about the impending nuptials he nonetheless makes an appearance to wish her well -- only to get upset over the fact that the newlyweds plan to have sex on their honeymoon with Bella still in human form an act that Jacob thinks will kill her. Bella and Edward dash off to Brazil and enjoy one night of bed-breaking bliss but when Bella wakes up with bruises Edward shies away from a rematch despite Bellas pleas. After a metaphor-packed montage of waterfalls and chess games she finally gets her way only to find herself knocked up with a bouncing baby bloodsucker within two weeks. A vampire fetus in a human womb is apparently unprecedented as no one knows quite what to do with a baby that is literally sucking the life out of its mother to the point where Bella is forced to begin a pre-natal nutritional regime that involves Type O and a straw. For a series about vampires ""Breaking Dawn Part 1"" feels like the first time that the visceral aspects are being addressed so its something of a relief to have Condon who began his career with cult horror classics like ""Strange Invaders"" there to carry the film across that line. Will Bella survive the birth? Will Edward resent his child if it kills his beloved wife? Can Jacob prevent a full-on vampires-vs.-werewolves war if this mixed-breed child is born? These and other soapy questions are answered with enough cliffhangers to keep the faithful rabidly awaiting ""Part 2"" next year. To his credit Condon takes this risible material as seriously as possible and makes the proceedings as stylish and creepy as he can. Theres a nifty flashback to Edwards murderous rampage in the 1930s (complete with a ""Bride of Frankenstein"" shout-out from the man who made ""Gods and Monsters"") and just like directors ranging from Robert Altman to Lars Von Trier Condon knows how to get the most out of a wedding sequence. The floral canopy will make the young girls swoon and the director finds the notes of genuine romance (when Edward and Bella kiss their audience disappears leaving them as the only two people on earth) and humor (the toasts are hilariously awkward). Pattinson and Stewart have proven themselves to be interesting screen presences in non-""Twilight"" projects -- the jurys still out on Lautner -- but all three of them remain in their usual groove of blank-faced mooning about. Some YouTube jokester will eventually be able to create montages that are 15 solid minutes of Edward looking pained Bella furrowing her brow Jacob flaring his nostrils etc. Cinematographer Guillermo Navarro (""Pans Labyrinth"" ""Jackie Brown"") gives the film a palpable lushness in locations ranging from the forests of the Pacific Northwest to the beaches of Brazil that matches the heroines fecundity and music supervisor Alexandra Patsavas has selected a terrific array of pop tunes even if some of the lyrics get a little heavy-handed in matching the onscreen action. (While Bellas pregnant theres some singing about little arms and little legs while another tune crams the ongoing ""lion and the lamb"" motif into our ears.) Based on the squealing adolescent girls (of all ages) in attendance at the L.A. press screening the brain trust behind the ""Twilight"" golden goose have once again hit all the right buttons to keep the fans happy. And even if Bill Condon couldnt completely overcome the inanity of the franchise he can still proudly hold his head up high at the Directors Guild cafeteria. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

But in Breaking Dawn -- Part 1 this perpetually sad/sullen/wincing young woman -- played as if every scene gives her cramps by the otherwise interesting Kristen Stewart -- is a big drip. Shes maddeningly inarticulate. Shes distressingly passive. Shes a bad role model for girls. So I say enough. Enough with Bellas depressed ragdoll posture and her eternal gloom. And a pox on Breaking Dawn the movie for its contented complicity with Stephenie Meyers ultimately awful message to millions of readers. What we learn in this all-pain/no-pleasure episode is that marriage feels like a life sentence weddings are miserable events honeymoon sex is dangerous and leaves a bride covered in bruises and pregnancy is a torment that leads to death in exchange for birth. Also during pregnancy families fight like werewolves and vampires. Way to go YA message. At least Bellas wedding gown is pretty. Ooh Cue the fashion blogs. Yes I know Twilight fans love The Twilight Saga. But they (you?) deserve something better to love. Nothing goes right for our resigned heroine. She hates the foot-squishing wobble-inducing high-heeled pumps urged on her by her stylish vampire sister-in-law-to-be Alice (Ashley Greene) -- Alice is the designated wedding planner -- but Bella doesnt even know how to put her foot down to demand an alternative. She has incapacitating panic-attack-sized wedding jitters. (Could she could be panicking because shes ridiculously young to be getting married to a vampire instead of oh furthering her education or pursuing a career or finding out what she really wants out of life? Nah thats just the liberal-elite feminist in me talking.) Edward (Robert Pattinson) Bellas fancy-haired blood-sucking groom is solicitous. But since Bella doesnt know how to speak to her beloved -- you know with words -- the two just gaze into each others eyes in the shared romantic agony of a young couple in over their heads. Jacob the werewolf (Taylor Lautner shirtless within 15 seconds of his first appearance) shows up at the wedding never missing an opportunity to be really really angry. Bella shows her pleasure at Jacobs appearance by looking fetchingly stricken -- she still loves him naturally just not in that way. Jacob responds by being angry. Bella has the haggard look of a prisoner on her honeymoon with Edward in Brazilian paradise. Director Bill Condon and his production team use every dollar of their big budget to make a very handsome picture but whats the fun of luxe scenery (or a fairytale wedding) under such circumstances? Countless blog posts can and will be written about the couples honeymoon sex life -- ""Im hurting you"" Edward groans with guilt. ""No. Its. Good"" says Bella wincing. Perhaps Ill add my own blog post to the ephemeral literature in a few days. Just know this The overall message of Breaking Dawn is that humans must suffer on this earth. Especially women. Jeez pregnancy and childbirth staged with exorbitant production-design attention to gyno-catastrophe look like scenes of full-on fright-night horror. As The Twilight Saga grinds to its conclusion with the upcoming Breaking Dawn -- Part 2 neither the trendiness of vampires and werewolves nor the playful vox pop fun of declaring allegiance to Team Edward and Team Jacob are enough to justify the prim sermon of fleshly punishment that is Twilights eternal hooey-filled message of damnation.

By Colin Covert Star Tribune November 17 2011 -- 155pm Video (5833)  ""Breaking Dawn Part 1"" moves the long-simmering courtship between Edward and Bella (and Jacob) to matrimony pregnancy and beyond. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Critics may lambaste the ""Twilight"" series for the redundant nature of the films (Girl loves vampire Werewolf loves girl Werewolves and vampires hate each other) but the movies have found a sweet spot that adds up to regular nine-figure grosses. They succeed by that rarest of gifts Understanding the audience. As long as relationships splinter and families drift apart there will be a market for fantasies of everlasting romance and unshakable clan loyalty. ""Breaking Dawn Part 1"" moves the long-simmering courtship between Edward and Bella (and Jacob) to matrimony pregnancy and beyond. It is by far the weirdest entry so far a superheated stew of contradictory messages about sexuality and self-sacrifice. Bellas premonition of her wedding is a blood-soaked dream sequence that climaxes with the corpses of her loved ones piled up like cordwood but thats misdirection. Its Bella herself who will suffer enduring the grisliest supernatural childbirth since ""Rosemarys Baby."" After her dream wedding to Edward theres a modest honeymoon montage of entangled body parts (slender arms frail alabaster shoulders a dainty chest -- all Robert Pattinsons I think) and a discreet fadeout. Cut to their wrecked bedroom the following morning Bellas numerous bruises and an exchange no newlywed wants to hear. ""Im terribly sorry for hurting you."" ""Youre not going to touch me anymore are you?"" And so it begins. Edward shows no further matrimonial interest in his bride magically pregnant after one night of PG-13 bliss. A vampire-human ""abomination"" swells her belly like a prize pumpkin breaking ribs and draining her bodily fluids. Its sickening to see Kristen Stewart photoshopped down to the skin and bones look of a famine victim or fashion model. When she suffers morning sickness the urge to purge along with her is strong. Taylor Lautners warm-blooded Jacob disowns his furry tribe joining Bellas vampire family to give her cuddles and emotional support in her time of need. Edward selflessly encourages this nutty menage a trois a setup even harder to swallow than Bellas pregnancy diet of blood milkshakes. As for the birth of little half- human Renesmee dont ask. The absurdity quotient of the movie begins high and rapidly escalates to bedlam. The characters dont grow much. Bella remains a passive sulky martyr. Her father the chief of police exhibits zero curiosity about his peculiar new in-laws. Jacob may have great abs but where his love life is concerned he still hasnt developed a spine. (When the wolf-boy does ""imprint"" on the child of his lifelong love its hard not to see it through the lens of pedophilia.) Edward still doesnt own a comb. Andrew Cooper Summit Entertainment Kristen Stewart right and Robert Pattinson star in ""The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn Part 1."" The film has the technical gloss one expects from a deep-pocketed franchise. Guillermo Navarro (""Pans Labyrinth"") photographs the proceedings handsomely. The computer-generated wolves look all right though theyre now the size of SUVs. Bill Condons direction isnt at the level of his ""Dreamgirls""  but its on a par with the material hes given. The best moment comes after the film proper has ended. A coda in the middle of the end credits brings back Michael Sheens witty prissy Euro-vampire prince. As he sets up the premise for the final episode his one-minute cameo outshines the preceding movie.  If this is escapist fantasy which way is the escape hatch? ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

And yes the first in the final two-parter is all about sex about the risky wedding night and the subsequent pregnancy that puts Bellas life in danger pitting werewolves against vampires in the process.But before that something much nicer happens Bella and Edward smile. A lot. The usually doleful duo marry in an idyllic ceremony in the woods her stunning dress likely to spawn as many imitators as Kate Middletons. Family and friends gather to celebrate and Anna Kendrick gets a chance to make her usual wisecracks (Who else gets married at 18? muses her cynical character Jessica convinced the bride is pregnant). This marriage is the moment romantic Twi-hards have been waiting for and theyre well served.The Brazilian honeymoons equally decorative and of course features another key moment the consummation. As they embrace in the sea under the moonlight (naked) theres undeniable chemistry between the real-life couple. But the bedroom scenes border on the ridiculous as Edward grips the headboard breaking the bed with his super-vampire strength. Bellas insistence that she doesnt mind the bruises is downright masochistic.Events from here revolve around the baby thats crushing Bella from the inside a dark plotline that leads to much melodrama but also the franchises most suspenseful scenes. Even if you know the outcome its gripping stuff and Stewart sure is good at looking life-threateningly ill. There are tender moments between the expectant parents and the character of lovesick Jacob still adds interest despite Taylor Lautners limited range.Blending serious fantasy-drama themes with soapy dialogue cartoony-looking vampires and wolves whose thoughts we can hear this remains a strange hybrid of genres. But as ever its hard to separate the films from the fandom. As a stand-alone movie its a mixed bag. But it progresses the story of beloved characters with a reverence for the source material that will doubtlessly please Twi-hards ushering in a finale that promises to be darker still.

It lacks excitement and humour and theres too many characters. If the series was ever going to drop the ball it was going to be on this part of the story. Twihards should maybe lower their expectations and be prepared for some mouth gapingly bizarre scenes in the second half. It hasnt deterred me from wanting to see the final film as the leads are still likeable but I hope to god its better than thisFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 19 2011IanFeaturedIts the sound of barrels being scraped. Surely the most cynical piece of marketing rip offs ever as the Twilight ""franchise"" desperately seeks another dip into the purses of angst riddent teenage girls by stretching what could easily be covered in one film into two marketing and sales opportunities. The film is very slow and very little happens and what does is mixed with over stretched filler scenes to desperately try to pad out what is little more than a 45 minute film into something more than twice as long so to leave enough for a second installment next year. The film can be summed up as follows. Edward and Bella are to get married. Jake is moody takes his top off for no apparent reason. First box ticked. Bella doesnt like the glam wedding shoes and prefers her emo trainers. Second box ticked for all moody emo girls as it shows you can be miserable never smile and generally be sulky and still get the rich good looking guy. They get married in an incedibly over the top forest scene. All the time moody nightmares pad out the flimsy plot to fill time. They go on honeymoon to Rio. Yet more padding of time. Over long gratuitous shots of Pattison in very little. Another box ticked. You get the story or what little there is of it. It really is that dull. A true example of style over substance.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/89637/the-twilight-saga-breaking-dawn-part-one.html,200,thetwilightsagabreakingdawnpart128,thetwilightsagabreakingdawnpart1,timeout
"Breaking Dawn movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn What to expect when youre expecting a vampire a 1 1/2 starsNovember 17 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticThe fourth film in the ""Twilight"" series reveals a flash or two of real filmmaking (mostly in a suggestively grotesque birthing sequence) enough to save it from pure lousiness.But a significant number of its 117 minutes do seem like hours and whenever certain actors take the lead and set the pace of the dialogue time itself begins to crawl backward and the breaking dawn begins to feel like yesterdays breaking dawn or last Tuesdays.How did this happen? Quite apart from the source materials morbidity -- the Stephenie Meyer novel a combined abstinence lecture and anti-abortion allegory has been broken into two separate features this years and next years -- how did Bill Condon the director with the most stylish and idiosyncratic resume of any to undertake a ""Twilight"" installment deliver the dullest movie of the bunch?And is there anything to do about Taylor Lautner? Hes had four films now to improve yet hes still coming off like a reedy-voiced pretender doing his best but...say what you will about Robert Pattinson (fwoopy-haired vampire Edward) or Kristen Stewart (Edwards squeeze Bella) but Stewart is up around here Pattinson a little below that and Lautner (heartbroken werewolf Jacob) is down there somewhere.So Sex with a vampire. Finally. For three films now the ""Twilight"" narrative has practically goaded the audience into having intercourse on behalf of the characters. (Bella is 18 and in ""Breaking Dawn"" she gets pregnant with demon child about 20 minutes after losing her virginity.) The smoldering and the we-cant-we-shouldnt sweet nothings have been going on between Bella and Edward with a side order of Jacob for what seems like centuries. Honeymooning on an isle off the Brazilian coast bammo Edwards demon seed starts its journey and eventually starts breaking Bellas bones from the inside. (Told you morbid) Once Bella is fighting for her life back home in Forks Wash. the controversial pregnancy foments another round of species warfare between the vamps and the wolves.""Twilight"" the phenomenon sells one thing above all else the idea of sex with serious immediate and clinically painful consequences. Of the ""Twilight"" pictures to date this one works least well as a stand-alone product. Condon does strangely little to energize the various heart-to-hearts and the wedding-jitters montage scenes. The oversized wolves the superfast-motion imagery and other ""Twilight"" effects flourishes look as cheesy as ever. Composer Carter Burwell one of the best in the business has been dragged down to a level of mediocre wallpaper music one wouldnt have thought possible.But dont listen to me. I enjoyed the first two for what they were and didnt much like the third one which many considered the best. ""Breaking Dawn -- Part 1"" sets up ""Part 2."" That should be enough from a business perspective.

"Breaking Dawn Part 1 (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Breaking Dawn Part 1 (PG-13) The first half of the concluding chapter in the ""Twilight"" saga compels despite some howl-worthy flaws. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com11/16/2011 Editor rating 2.5 Lets get the bad stuff out of the way first Taylor Lautner remains an unreliable wildly uneven actor. His line readings range from fine to passable to stilted and awkward sometimes all within the same scene and you cant imagine him having much of a career once this franchise runs its course. The wolf pack -- the five native Americans of Quilette descent who also happen to be lycanthropes -- are played by actors chosen for their six-pack abs not their talents. Whenever one of them opens his mouth you are instantly catapulted right out of the movie. And the computer-generated werewolves still look cheap and cartoonish -- never more so than in a scene in which they stand around talking (or at least communicating telepathically.) Unintentional laughter is practically guaranteed. But despite all that The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn -- Part 1 does something that no other previous Twilight movie had achieved This one draws you close and keeps you there -- and for those of us who havent read Stephenie Meyers novel delivers some surprising turns of plot. As the movie opens the long and tortured courtship between the teenage Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her vampire boyfriend Edward (Robert Pattinson) has reached an end and they are finally preparing to marry. Director Bill Condon (Dreamgirls Kinsey) and screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg dont waste any time building up to the ceremony. The film hurtles towards Bella and Edwards big day with a sense of purpose and drive giving us hints along the way (such as Bellas nightmares) that this couple may not necessarily live happily ever after. ""Whats a wedding without some family drama?"" Edward ponders after a brief blow-up at the reception implies vampires and humans may not necessarily make the best in-laws. Then comes the honeymoon which proves that vampires and humans may not make ideal couples either. Working with cinematographer Guillermo Navarro (who shot Pans Labyrinth and Jackie Brown) Condon gives Breaking Dawn a visual elegance and style the other films lacked. Right from the start the movie feels different -- more mature and confident and substantial -- which is critical because the story is about to take some loopy twists pushing up into territory far more bizarre than any of the previous pictures suggested. One of the most common complaints leveled at the Twilight movies is that nothing ever happens After the first film in which Bella and Edward met and fell in love subsequent chapters consisted primarily of pining and longing and pointless romantic triangles (all that hand-wringing over Jacob for example). But no matter what you make of Breaking Dawn -- and if you adamantly hate all things Twilight this film is not going to change your mind -- I cant imagine anyone complaining that the movie was too slow. Condon knows that the chemistry between Stewart and Pattinson has been the key to the popularity of this series and he focuses on their connection as much as he can throughout the film. A long sequence in which the newlyweds honeymoon off the coast of Brazil and start having sex is easily the best most engrossing stretch of any Twilight movie to date. While always observant of that PG-13 rating Breaking Dawn is still surprisingly frank and direct in depicting Bellas nervousness about losing her virginity (something Stewart conveys in a terrific silent montage) and later her cravings for a third and fourth and fifth helping (where the male is usually the aggressor in the sexual arena the movie cleverly reverts the tables making Edward the sought-after object of lust.) The trailers for Breaking Dawn have already revealed that Bella winds up pregnant -- and that her baby starts to grow inside her at an alarming speed. The birth of Bella and Edwards demon-child will have far-reaching consequences most of which wont be settled until Part 2 arrives next year. I have no idea where the story goes from here (although theres a scene that comes halfway through the end credits that gives you a good idea.) But the biggest compliment you can pay Breaking Dawn is that the entire series could have ended with this movie and I would have been satisfied ridiculous werewolves and all. Imagine then how diehard Twilight fans will respond. Let the feeding frenzy begin.

The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn -- Part 1 Bad to fair Director Bill Condon. Cast Kristen Stewart Robert Pattinson Taylor Lautner. Rating PG-13 for disturbing images violence sexuality/partial nudity and some thematic elements. Movies about weddings Vampire hunks Thats got to be some kind of record. And for the junior-high crowd the ticket line forms over to the left. Forget that the film is too long and not very exciting that the dialogue is still as deadly as a vampire bite (sorry -- the lame writing must be contagious) and that some of it is SPOKEN BY WOLVES. Well werewolves but still. What makes these movies popular are the stars -- Kristen Stewart Robert Pattinson and Lautner - portraying a sort of supernatural high-school fantasy romance with fangs and claws. All are in evidence here. Valley Twilight premiere parties Goodykoontz The Twilight appeal Twilight films recap ""Breaking Dawn"" like the rest of the series is based on a Stephenie Meyer novel. But like the last ""Harry Potter"" installment the ""Twilight"" literary swan song has been split into two films. With ""Potter"" it was probably justified in the end. With ""Twilight"" one movie would have been more than enough. Even director Bill Condon who has made films like ""Gods and Monsters"" cant do much with it. As the film begins its the day before the wedding for Bella Swan (Stewart) and Edward Cullen (Pattinson). Everything seems nice enough though its a little odd since the family of the groom is a bunch of vampires and all. And Bella is nervous as one might expect an 18-year-old bride to be; a nightmare prevents her from getting the beauty sleep wedding planner Alice (Ashley Greene) insists upon. But the big day goes off nicely. The wedding is beautiful the setting - the Cullens property -- gorgeous. Jacob (Lautner) shows up as a friendly gesture to bid Bella farewell on her last night as a human before Edward turns her into a vampire. But wait -- thats not the kind of honeymoon Bella has planned. Instead she wants the normal human kind which Jacob warns will kill her. (Some assumed knowledge about vampire sex is evidently useful here; Im in the dark.) But soon enough Edward and Bella are on a beach in Brazil where headboards are shattered that sort of thing. Edward is afraid hell hurt Bella but shell have none of that hesitation. And then evidently against all odds Bella gets pregnant. The baby - half-vampire half-human - grows quickly inside her draining her of nutrients; she begins wasting away. A debate about whether to have the baby never really rises above the ""Its a fetus"" ""Its a baby"" level but Bellas stance is clear She will have the baby even if it kills her (and it seems certain it will). For some reason a half-vampire half-human baby threatens the werewolves (of which Jacob is one on the off chance youre not on board with the story). So they have a heated argument while in wolf form about what to do which ranks as the most ridiculous thing in the movie - at least until the fight scene later on. This takes a long time to unfold. Mostly we watch Bella sit around feeling terrible. Edward comes up with a novel remedy but it has drawbacks. Can Bella survive the birth? And isnt survival a relative term in this context? After showing a little spark in ""Eclipse"" the previous film in the series Stewart is back in mope mode. Pattinson again stands around looking pale and soulful while Lautner gets to act more which is maybe not such a good thing. It all builds to a final scene that is actually somewhat powerful particularly considering whats come before. But overall the film is goofy slight without a truly deep thought in its pretty little head. And for a movie with vampires and werewolves the only scary thing is in the title - ""Part 1"" which means ""Part 2"" is on its way. Shudder. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

It is in many respects the best installment of the franchise as its stars go from sullen kids to sullen young adults where their expressions look more natural.The movie also is in its most capable hands with director Bill Condon (Gods and Monsters). And while no one is going to confuse Dawn with Nosferatu the series is finding momentum as it nears its finale (Part 2 hits theaters Nov. 16 2012).STORY Pattinson Stewart talk wedding at films premierePHOTOS A look at Twilight through the yearsMORE Twilight fans can follow a Breaking Dawn trail in BrazilDawn picks up where Eclipse left off with our heroes Edward (Robert Pattinson) and Bella (Kristen Stewart) set to wed. The wedding is as storybook as the romance which explains why there are so many Twilight moms Bella is perceptive and patient saving sex for marriage. Edward is loyal and has been waiting a century to lose his virginity. See a zombie be that patient.About the movieThe Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn - Part 1    out of fourStars Robert Pattinson Kristen Stewart Taylor Lautner Director Bill CondonDistributor Summit Entertainment Rating PG-13 for distrubing images violence sexuality partial nudity and some thematic violence Running time 1 hour 57 minutes Opens midnight Thursday nationwide.But when the newlyweds become expectant parents of a half-vampire trouble brews in the werewolf world. Here is where Dawn finds itself maturing. Bella and Edward have discussions about sex parenthood and abortion. The lessons arent insightful but are high ground for the franchise.Stewarts transformation to the living dead is strong. Pattinson remains a doe-eyed matinee idol though spurned werewolf lover Jacob (Taylor Lautner) gets to act a little. Still his shirt is off five seconds after the opening credits.Of course it wouldnt be Twilight without a few conventions Parents dont understand and arent to be told much. There isnt a bad-looking monster in the bunch. And at nearly two hours the film is too long.But none of this will be unwelcome news to fans who waited in tents for tickets this week to see the forbidden fruit taken. And the final scene of the movie simply a shot of Bellas eyes makes a convincing harbinger that hell is on its way. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Bella Swan kisses abstinence and mortality goodbye in ""The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn -- Part 1"" in which the vampire-loving teen gets hitched knocked up and almost destroyed from within by her little bundle of joy. All the more disappointing then that a story so pregnant with dramatic possibilities should wind up feeling like such an unconsummated opportunity. Drawn from Stephenie Meyers polarizing weirdly compelling fourth novel the film is rich in surface pleasures but lacks any palpable sense of darkness or danger which is a roundabout way of saying that Summit has protected its investment well. Supernatural B.O. awaits. The guardians of this enormously popular franchise (1.8 billion in worldwide grosses) have in effect followed the ""Harry Potter"" playbook by splitting the final chapter into two parts ensuring thorough plot retention and more to the point maximum B.O. penetration. In what will seem cruel and unusual punishment for fans however ""Part 2"" with its promise of a full-scale vampire war in which Bella will play a crucial role is slated to hit theaters Nov. 16 2012 forcing auds to wait nearly a year after ""Part 1"" to devour the second half of the Bill Condon-directed double feature. Certainly the highest-profile helmer attached to the series so far Condon takes the reins capably enough here though his approach suffers from a certain stylistic anonymity that seems endemic to the material. Like any commercial behemoth ""The Twilight Saga"" by nature resists any attempt at transcendence experimentation or risk; thats especially unfortunate in the case of ""Breaking Dawn"" which is by far the most out-there novel in the series and would have benefited from a dash of Cronenbergian body-horror and commercial restraints notwithstanding a willingness to push past a PG-13 rating. Given the early fright pics on his resume the chameleonlike Condon would have been more than up to the challenge if given the chance. Things begin happily enough with a wedding as Bella (Kristen Stewart) says ""I do"" to Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and joins his family of shimmeringly benevolent vampires. Still violently opposed to the union is Bellas lupine best friend and spurned suitor Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) especially when he learns the new Mrs. Cullen has decided to postpone her bloodsucker transformation until after her Brazilian honeymoon. Jacob is right to worry Though filmed with the utmost soft-focus duvet-wrapped tastefulness the couples wedding night leaves Bella covered with bruises the bed in tatters and the audience presumably in a puddle of ecstasy. Surely this must be the first movie series so innately fearful of sex (and yet so dependent on its leads sex appeal) that even proper conjugal relations come with a note of caution none more frightening than when Bella suddenly finds herself with child -- half-human half-vampire a phenomenon with no biological precedent. Up to this point Condon and returning series scribe Melissa Rosenberg have translated the material in appreciably swoon-worthy fashion. Bella and Edwards woodland wedding may look like an Abercrombie amp; Fitch spread (their honeymoon suite skews more Pottery Barn) but its an ardently unabashedly romantic setpiece. By now Stewart and Pattinson have merged so completely with their roles and each other that the sight of the duos matrimonial bliss -- delicately shaded by that sense of transience and loss that attends even happy life transitions -- delivers a genuine emotional payoff. Woozy soft-rock montages and moonlit skinny-dipping interludes come effortlessly to ""Breaking Dawn -- Part 1."" The film is far less adept at conveying the requisite mounting stakes once the newlyweds rush home to find themselves under siege on multiple fronts. True to the spirit of masochistic self-sacrifice that has defined the series the now haggard-looking blood-sipping Bella insists on carrying her demon-child to term not only endangering her own life (and suggesting a potentially fascinating medical debate) but also inciting a full-on war between the Cullens and Jacobs werewolf pack. Every time the film shifts away from Bella and Edward to address the larger group dynamics the narrative goes flat and the ensembles line readings turn to wood in large part because this style of dramatization is so at odds with the thrust of the source material. Meyer no great prose stylist but an intuitive storyteller places unusual emphasis on sensory and extrasensory gifts; that various characters can read minds smell scents and hear heartbeats is of crucial importance to the advancing narrative. These are tricky fundamentally un-cinematic modes of perception and that they havent found their visual equivalents here is hardly surprising. More trying is the fact that Lautner plays the pivotal role of Jacob as such a softie; a more ferocious testosterone-fueled approach would have raised the temperature of individual scenes and enabled the actor to hold his own better opposite Stewart and Pattinson. On the action front the otherwise polished production reps a significant downgrade from the superior ""Eclipse"" Two nocturnal wolves-vs.-vamps combat scenes are essentially thrill-free and so underlit that one is inclined to suspect slapdash CGI. With any luck its a mere warm-up act for the more epic supernatural showdown brewing a year from now.

TWITTER Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson take their characters relationship to the next level in Part 1 of the epic franchise finale. Big things happen in this penultimate Twilight entry Bella and Edward get married she gets pregnant on their Brazilian honeymoon and almost perishes before giving birth and finally after four films and about 490 minutes of screen time depicting simmering desire and superhuman restraint she wakes up with the red eyes of a vampire. (Spoiler? Hardly.) But so little else occurs between these momentous events in Twilight Breaking Dawn -- Part 1 that you can practically hear every second ticking by while awaiting the payoff. Not that this will matter to the faithful who have devoured all 754 pages of Stephenie Meyers series-climaxing tome and want to see as many as possible re-created on the screen nor to those who have paid more than 1.8 billion worldwide to see the previous three installments in theaters nearly all of whom will rush to see this one as soon as possible. Part 2 wont follow until Nov. 16 2012. PHOTOS New Images of Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn When the decision was made to split Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows into two films to bring that blockbuster series to a close there was cynical talk regarding mercenary motives to milk as many dollars as possible out of the franchise. Once the films came out however that talk stopped so emphatically did the massive narrative incident justify the extended length. On the basis of Breaking Dawn -- Part 1 though the same cannot be said of this series ender which feels as bloated and anemic as Bella becomes during her pregnancy. The film is like a crab cake with three or four bits of crab surrounded by loads of bland stuffing but many cant tell the difference or dont care which will largely be true for its captive audience. Taking place in a lovely woodsy setting that could easily be the next estate over from the wedding-reception site in Lars von Triers Melancholia the nuptials of Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) and Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) can plausibly be termed the ""wedding of the century"" only in the sense Edward means it when he tells his 18-year-old bride ""Ive been waiting a century to marry you."" Drawn out to last nearly a half-hour onscreen the gaiety of the preliminaries and ensuing event is encumbered by a strong sense of foreboding not only because the world is coming to an end as in Melancholia but also because it means Bella will soon pass over from human life to the vampire side. PHOTOS The Evolution of Film Vampires Upon receiving the wedding invitation the first reaction of Bellas friend Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) is to go wolf and race into the forest in a snit but he finally turns up to wish her well before the happy couple jets off to Rio which is so little seen it scarcely seems worth the trip. At their lush honeymoon villa Edward is every inch the gentleman -- too much so perhaps for Bella. They skinny dip at night to some incredibly insipid songs theyre very tender and understanding with each other and then in the morning the bedroom is in total disarray; we never see anything of what came between no moment of surrender which is what the series has been building to all along. Where one legitimately hopes to register what Bella feels upon finally giving herself over to what she has so long desired but resisted all we get are languid and lax interludes of what still seems like puppy love. Very lame and very disappointing. At about the films halfway point Bella finds shes unexpectedly pregnant prompting a quick return home. When Jacob comes by and observes her already-obvious condition he gets to bellow an immortal accusation to Edward ""You did this"" As Edward searches for a proper rejoinder Jacob again scampers off whereupon the local werewolf tribe reacts with a lot of teeth-baring and internal bickering over what to do. Meanwhile Bella turns pale and gaunt and seems in danger of wasting away; it appears the fetus is taking all of the nutrients for itself and leaving nothing for Mom who can no longer eat normal food. Theres only one solution to this state of affairs the administering of which brings Bella back to life as Part 1 pushes toward its end. PHOTOS 10 Biggest Book-to-Big Screen Adaptations of the Last 25 Years During the very slow scenes depicting Bellas deterioration as Stewart appears progressively skeletal so little else is going on that one is obliged to muse over whether the pounds came off digitally or the old-fashioned way. After the energy and alertness evident in his previous work as helmer of Gods and Monsters Kinsey and Dreamgirls it looks as though director Bill Condon fell into a trance while making this film -- so dirgelike is the pacing so banal is Melissa Rosenbergs dutiful script on a scene-by-scene moment-to-moment basis. It truly feels that 40 minutes or so not two hours would have been plenty to convey all thats necessary in the material covered. Even the normally first-rate film composer Carter Burwell is dragged down by the occasion though his score is marginally less watery than the songs that dominate the soundtrack. The actors have long since been set in their performances and there are no surprises here. In the end given how little goes on in Breaking Dawn -- Part 1 despite the major plot points what youre left with is to gaze at the three leads all of whom have their constituencies and reasons for being eminently watchable. The only hope is theyll have more to do next time around.
