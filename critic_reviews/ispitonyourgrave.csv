Jennifer a cock-teasing big-city writer rents a remote lakeside house where she is humiliated gang-raped and left for dead by the kind of slavering good ol boys familiar from Deliverance. A few weeks later the traumatised Jennifer emerges from the woods to take her revenge using fish hooks garden shears a flesh-peeling acid bath and a rifle barrel thrust where the sun dont shine. Monroes reworking introduces two new elements an ambiguously motivated local sheriff and the attackers use of a video camera to record their actions. Unfortunately for the filmmakers the BBFC felt that these voyeuristic video images invited the viewer to enjoy the eroticised sadistic sexual violence so less titillating footage has been substituted. Jennifers cruel calculated vengeance which ironically mirrors her own abuse is also excessive - but it has the spurious defence of being justified.

(Steve Dietl) Sarah Butler in a scene from ""I Spit on Your Grave"" The biblical vigilantism unfolds as it must.(Steve Dietl) Movie review I Spit on Your Grave A bad idea then a bad idea now Add to ... Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 15 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English WHAT IS IT? More to the point what was it? Specifically this is a remake of a flick that many think shouldnt have been made in the first place. Back in 1978 Day of the Woman pushed the then-popular vigilante theme to graphic and exploitative extremes. Extremely graphic because as the theme ran its predictable course from victimhood to vengeance the sex-violence meter got cranked up to awfully brutal crude and explicit levels. Extremely exploitative because a lone woman assaulted and raped by a gang of men doubled as both the initial victim and the subsequent avenger. Multimedia I Spit on Your Grave Official trailer So its not hard to spot the tactics in the original. In its chauvinistic attack phase that movie salaciously stripped and humiliated an attractive female; then in the feminist counterattack segment it ostensibly empowered the same woman although only by having her embrace the very violence she endured. Yep as strategies go thats transparent stuff but it obviously worked on a disgusted Roger Ebert who in high dudgeon pronounced it the worst movie ever made. Despite that superlative the picture quickly disappeared later to be semi-resurrected by the usual small cult of admirers/apologists offering the usual arguments The explicitness is disgusting because rape is disgusting and (aint it ingenious) the audience is meant to feel complicit in the offence. And thus the film languished awaiting its inevitable rebirth in this post-Abu Ghraib era of torture porn. All hail the second coming. HOW DOES IT WORK? Exactly like the first with a few narrative details altered but with the logical holes in the plot as massively absurd as ever. Jennifer the city gal (Sarah Butler) ventures to a cabin in the woods where the red-neck country guys lie in wait four of them simply vicious and the other just simple-minded. Of course since even hicks pack a camera these days the assault is videotaped in this version an attempt to intensify our peeping-Tom complicity. From there the biblical vigilantism unfolds as it must. The woman will suffer and then inflict suffering in kind - voyeurs will have their eyes plucked out violators will be violated the sodomizers sodomized. And everyone will look and feel soiled not least of all us. DOES IT MATTER? Nope. Sure we in the media may try to make it matter as many will condemn righteously and a few will praise faintly and others will compare the levels of explicitness then and now in a vain wish to read the barometer of social change. But no all thats as silly and wasteful as the picture itself which is neither boring enough to qualify as pornography nor vital enough to generate a controversy. Damn I cant even subject I Spit on Your Grave to the great expectorations it so badly desires. I Spit on Your Grave Directed by Steven R.

A shallow Grave | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesA shallow GraveRemake of the 1978 revenge-horror grindhouse gorefest is just as troubling as its predecessor.I Spit on Your Grave opens Friday.  (HANDOUT)  By Jason AndersonSpecial to the StarThu. Oct. 14 2010 I Spit on Your Grave (out of 4) Starring Sarah Butler Chad Lindberg and Andrew Howard. Directed by Steven R. Monroe. 107 minutes. At major theatres. 18A Such is the markets appetite for remakes and updates of horror movies of the 70s and 80s that even one of the eras most notorious and repugnant shockers has been recycled by ever-enterprising producers. The matter of whether this particular property was better left in the crypt has already generated much debate among horror fans. Thats partially because any new version of I Spit on Your Grave inevitably inherits many of the same issues that have dogged the original since it first surfaced on the grindhouse circuit in 1978. A low-budget revenge thriller Zeir Marchis film was infamous for its depiction of sexual violence which was explicit even by the standards of exploitation cinema. Though some elements have been changed to better suit the tastes of todays Saw fanbase Steven R. Monroes version is just as likely to upset and infuriate. Again whats essentially on offer is an inordinately lengthy and graphic depiction of a womans brutalization and rape by a group of redneck thugs after she comes to a remote cabin for a writing retreat. In this case the victim is Jennifer (Sarah Butler) who first attracts the ire of the men when she stops at a local gas station and rebuffs a sexual advance. Seeing as her cellphone has been conveniently rendered unusable she is unable to get help when the men arrive at the cabin with the worst of intentions. Then again she wouldnt have received much assistance from the local sheriff (Andrew Howard) who turns out to be just as monstrous as her other attackers. The most significant difference here concerns the second half of the movie in which Jennifer gets her revenge. Whereas Marchis heroine lured her victimizers to their doom with the promise of consensual sex Monroe prefers to make his a more straightforward yet increasingly implausible figure. This time shes a coolly rational killer who shares the Jigsaw Killers ingenuity for creating diabolical contraptions. To his credit Monroe hasnt slicked up the material -- in fact his film may look even grubbier than the original which was hardly the case for new versions of Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Last House on the Left. Alas none of his modifications or decisions makes the still-abundant trove of sadistic and sexually violent imagery any easier to excuse or endure. Likewise the intended cathartic value of Jennifers acts of vengeance does not compensate for the sheer nastiness of whats come before. More troubling is how the movie wants viewers to regard the violence of the first part as upsetting and realistic before rewarding them with the requisite quota of gory kills. Some critics defended Marchis original on the basis that it stripped away the pretensions of Deliverance and Straw Dogs two more prestigious revenge flicks that were equally problematic when it came to matters of class and gender politics. An attempt to trade on its predecessors reputation without really grappling with the questions it raises Monroes version merely seems shallow cynical and extremely ugly.

Starring Sarah Butler Jeff Branson and Andrew Howard. Directed by Steven R. Monroe. (Not rated. 103 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) As vile unredeeming and thoroughly unpleasant experiences go ""I Spit on Your Grave"" at least has one thing interesting about it. Its a document of the most paranoid fantasies that urban Northern people have about a rural Southern people. A young writer goes to a cabin in the woods to work on her second novel and shes not there a week when five guys start plotting against the ""city bitch"" who is ""stuck up"" and thinks she is ""too good"" for honest country folk. They barge in torture her and gang-rape her. The scenes of torment and rape go on for at least a half hour of screen time and its hard to see by what stretch of the term this constitutes entertainment. Yet I suspect that many urban Northern coastal people will see these despicable hulking rednecks tormenting a refined accomplished young woman and feel their buttons getting pressed. They will see it as a tableau depicting the relative moral worth of blue state and red state America. They will receive this as though witnessing an Obama voter surrounded by a bunch of clowns who look as if they could be Joe the Plumbers cousins. And thus they will have a rooting interest of sorts when she escapes half dead and comes back in the second half to torture and slaughter each of those five rednecks. But just hold on there one minute cowboy. ""I Spit on Your Grave"" doesnt have a single Southerner or Southwesterner in the cast. Everybody is either from the Northwest or Brooklyn or Jersey City or Canada and the director Steven R. Monroe is from New York. You know that commercial about picante sauce made in New York City? This is the movie equivalent. In 1978 the original ""I Spit on Your Grave"" had the woman renting a cabin in upstate New York. Here the location isnt clear but even if it were specified the accents and attitudes tell their own story - this is ""Deliverance"" country. All we need is the kid with the banjo. In addition to all the obvious things that are disgusting about this movie ""I Spit on Your Grave"" is trying to get us to hate each other. Hate it instead. It makes more sense and the hatred is much more deserved. -- Advisory Rape torture mutilation simulated sex nudity bad language and a general air of stupidity throughout.

"Movie review I Spit On Your Grave - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-EntertainmentMovie review I Spit On Your GraveOctober 07 2010|By Michael OrdoA+-a The most shocking thing about ""I Spit on Your Grave"" is that someone thought the 1978 original deserved a remake. That was an artless poorly made leering phenomenally unintelligent chronicle of gang rape and intricate revenge. It set so low a bar that even this ill-conceived but slick venture can be called ""better."" Congratulations. But why take the return trip? Theres no suspense during the many long stalking sequences because we know whats going to happen when either beautiful soon-to-be-rape-victim or horrible soon-to-be-revenge-victims are being pursued. Thats the problem (one anyway) of making a film with nothing more than a premise. Thats it thats the whole movie. Oops spoiler alert. Heres another one The apparent motivation to revisit this exploitation ""classic"" was to drastically increase the violence. Certainly the rape and killings are more intricate graphic excruciating and nauseating. Hooray. At least the infuriating idiocy of the original sequences has been reduced. But dont worry this one is still mighty dumb. The original somehow generated debate over whether it was misogynist or feminist; clearly the pointless remakes only ""ist"" is ""sadistic."" Sure some folks get their jollies from seeing a woman extensively brutalized presumably justifying their voyeurism by then enjoying watching men suffer tortures that are to say the least unlikely. But for most there will be no adrenaline rush from fear or thrill or vicarious release from seeing tormentors tormented; one leaves feeling sad. Sad that this is what ""entertainment"" has come to. Come on filmmakers. Cant you do better? ""I Spit on Your Grave."" MPAA rating Unrated. Running time 1 hour 46 minutes. Playing at the Mann Chinese 6 Hollywood.

Share Tweet The impulse to remake any even moderately successful horror movie of the 70s and 80s hits rock bottom with I Spit On Your Grave which has the odd effect of cheapening one of the eras rankest most notorious pieces of exploitation trash. Shot with the plain day-lit marginally competent horror-realism of Last House On The Left the 1980 original is a rape-revenge story stripped down to its raw essence Woman travels alone to a backwoods cabin to do some writing; woman gets assaulted physically and sexually by five men (one mentally retarded) who leave her for dead; woman survives then gets her revenge by luring them into traps and killing them off one by one. (A hook from the trailer ""This woman will soon cut chop and burn five men beyond recognition and there isnt a jury in this country that would convict her."") Its not clever or multi-layered or stylized in an interesting way and it doesnt have a point other than to appeal artlessly to the audiences worst instincts. Not surprisingly the remake gussies up the grindhouse roughness of the first film which makes it relatively more palatable--yet still vapid and repulsive--while also in a perverse way selling it out. The first half more or less follows the outline Sarah Butler plays a big-city writer who heads to the boonies to work on her latest novel. She inadvertently insults a quartet of violent young rednecks who respond by invading her cabin and terrorizing and assaulting her in horrific fashion. The revenge part of the rape-revenge equation is where writer Stuart Morse and director Steven R. Monroe try to get creative by turning I Spit On Your Grave into Saw VIII losing much of the homemade crudeness that made the 1980 version so nauseatingly effective. In other words I Spit On Your Grave is now a grisly entertainment polished and full of rah-rah righteous kills calibrated to satisfy its bloodthirsty audience. That it succeeds speaks poorly of success. Share Tweet Filed Under Film More Movie Review Previous Movie Review Case 39 Next Movie Review Marwencol Dont miss a story--follow The A.V.

One This is a remake of Meir Zarchis infamous 1978 exercise I Spit on Your Grave made back when torture porn was readily identified as disgusting and worthy of outrage. Now its just one more movie in which genitals are sliced. Two Zarchi cannily exploited the eras interest in/fear of feminism (he preferred his title Day of the Woman).

Monroe remakes Meir Zarchis 1978 quintessential revenge-rape/rape-revenge film. Jennifer (Sarah Butler) rents a cabin in black-mud backwoods Louisiana to work in peace on her second novel. An encounter with a local gas-station attendant (Jeff Branson) that crackles with class anxiety starts him and his cronies percolating the idea of knocking the laptop-and-white-wine ""city bitch"" off her pedestal. A nighttime home invasion becomes all the more lurid with the false-salvation arrival of dawn and Andrew Howards rasp-voiced Sheriff. After absorbing every abuse save a coup de grace Jennifers despoiled body slips away. Theres little chance to judge our heroines prowess as a novelist but she proves herself very very talented at bonking her rapists over the head and devising horrible tortures for them when she returns as avenging angel which is convincing as long as Butler doesnt talk. These second-act torments arent merely premeditated but blueprinted. The mirror image of the cabin reflected in dark boggy water works as a metaphor for the movies structure. Everything that happens in the first part happens again--only in reverse and more so. When every injury is repaid with interest this self-destroying work has nowhere to go but to the credits. Such symmetry is a dismal barbarian sort of perfection.

Daily Edition Login to download I Spit on Your Grave -- Film Review 1029 PM PDT 10/14/2010 by John DeFore  AP FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Empty TWITTER Empty Its a lot harder to disgust viewers in these days of torture porn than it was at the close of the 1970s when the revenge flick ""I Spit on Your Grave"" (aka ""Day of the Woman"") crawled into theaters with an ostensible female-empowerment theme many saw as an excuse to depict multiple grueling rapes. Remaking that film is a dubious undertaking; it has yielded a movie that might be slightly more palatable than the first but will be much more quickly forgotten.A market for gross-out torture surely exists but without the gimmicky torments and style-heavy presentation of ""Saw"" and its ilk ""Grave"" seems unlikely to find much of it. Producers might view its marketplace handicaps with pride claiming to have sacrificed flash for an earthy identification with their heroine but theyll have a hard time selling that to many feminists.Setting up the action in familiar slasher-film mode ""Grave"" leaves little room for accusations that it identifies with the rapists -- filthy dumb hillbillies who run a gas station and clearly are intimidated by city girl Jennifer (Sarah Butler) who rents a cabin in the nearby woods.After a bit of stalking and one hard-to-swallow twist theyre joined by a more intriguing villain a ringleader capable of pausing in the middle of triple-X sadism to sweetly answer a call from his young daughter. The gang abuses Jennifer in predictably degrading ways -- borrowing heavily from ""Deliverance"" -- then assumes she is dead when she falls off a bridge into a river.Jennifer might as well be dead for all the spirit we see when she returns to kill her assailants one by one. Butler aiming for a shellshocked single-mindedness offers a monotonous performance that makes her seem less a woman regaining control of her life than a bloodthirsty zombie. It doesnt help that the script simply has her repeating back the lewd unimaginative taunts the men lobbed at her earlier on.What she does to each of those men is appropriately extreme a catalog of violated orifices and severed appendages and will be enough to gratify whatever sad souls like to watch this stuff on a Friday night. But in terms of real horror nevermind sexual-politics provocation ""Grave"" can neither re-create its predecessors impact nor compete with stranger new beasts like Lars von Triers ""Antichrist.""Opens Friday Oct. 8 (Anchor Bay)Production Family of the Year Prods.
