Neither is surprising Contraband is a muscular old- fashioned honour-among-thieves fairy tale that takes no risks but contains enough plot twists and blue-collar wish fulfilment to guarantee a fun night out.In his latest shot at working-class-hero status Mark Wahlberg plays Chris a smuggler-turned-family man forced to get back in the game when his wayward brother-in-law gets in hock to a gang of dealers led by drawling wigga psychopath Briggs (Giovanni Ribisi apparently channelling the spirit of George Kennedy). Leaving best pal Sebastian (Ben Foster) in charge of wife Kate (Kate Beckinsale) and their two small kids Chris hitches a ride on a cargo ship bound for Panama accompanied by a motley band of drug-runners.Though admittedly drowning in Pabst-swilling Springsteen chic and weary one-last-job cliches Contraband is a stylishly directed thriller that benefits from a knotty unpredictable script and an indisputably great cast. While frontman Wahlberg is suitably terse and brooding as the put-upon hero Foster Diego Luna JK Simmons and especially Ribisi add much-needed spice with a ragged parade of scenery-chewing scene-stealing supporting turns.The result is unlikely to linger long in the memory but its enormous fun while it lasts particularly the central Panama sequences all vibrant colour and thundering pistol fire. The final act too is a real crowd-pleaser wrapping up a tangle of storylines in unfashionably upbeat feelgood fashion. So perhaps Contraband is crime-by-numbers - but its also  honest unpretentious and highly entertaining.

However the film quickly descends into a bit of a bore. There is nowhere near as much action as the trailer would have you believe. Basically Marky Mark takes a boat to Panama stays for an hour and is involved in a completely irrelevant shootout (added purely to give the film a bit of action) then gets the boat back home with some swag. Theres very little tension or drama. Other crime caper films like The Italian Job or Oceans 11 put this film to shame.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 29 2012critiqueFeaturedPassable action thriller.

"Contraband review Wahlberg should be beyond brainless action flicks by this point |       NJ.com comments Contraband review Wahlberg should be beyond brainless action flicks by this point Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 13 2012 at 745 AM View/Post Comments Patti PerretMark Wahlberg plays a reformed smuggler forced to do the inevitable One Last Job in ""AAContraband.""AA Mark Wahlbergs new action picture is called ""Contraband"" but its really about a plot to ship some high-end funny money into the country. So why didnt they call it ""Counterfeit""? Maybe because they knew it was. Theres nothing real about this movie -- not the relationships not the accents not the plot twists. Its the Hollywood version of a Canal Street knockoff -- fake brand names plastered over sloppy workmanship. Thats a shame because one of the real brand names here -- Mark Wahlberg -- was beginning to stand for something. He was foul and funny in ""The Departed"" tried hard in ""The Lovely Bones"" and provided a solid center to ""The Fighter."" But Wahlberg has always looked at his career as a business and that means making some calculated decisions -- and apparently right now he felt it was time to shore up his action-hero cred with a beer-and-biceps action picture. ""Contraband"" however is not it. Based on a 2008 Icelandic picture that never got a theatrical release here -- and directed by one of that movies stars -- its the story of a reformed smuggler whos settled down. But then he gets extorted into doing One Last Job. As far as crime movies go this scenario is so old it needs a walker. And nothing here particularly jazzes it up. Not the New Orleans locations (peopled as they are with characters who all sound like they got bused in from Dorchester). Not the story (which fails to provide a caper movies two essentials -- a colorful gang and an interesting scheme). And certainly not the direction which can barely keep the camera in focus let alone figure out where to point it. As for the actors Wahlberg does his patented Andy Samberg impression nodding his head in dully concerned sweetly sincere incomprehension. He still has that altar-boy/hoodlum look -- he always will -- but the movie gives him nothing to do with it. Giovanni Ribisi overacts as usual but is at least entertaining. Ben Foster doesnt overact for once and isnt. Kate Beckinsale has little to do but get beaten up and wait for her next ""Underworld"" movie. When the gang goes south things briefly pick up with a crazy Latin American shoot-out that wouldnt be out of place in the upcoming (and better) ""Miss Bala."" And as the angry captain of a freighter J.K. Simmons regularly delights (and even remembers his accent). But frankly Wahlberg has outgrown movies like this. And so have we. Ratings note The film contains violence strong language and drug and alcohol abuse. Contraband (R) Universal (109 min.) Directed by Baltasar Kormakur. With Mark Wahlberg Kate Beckinsale Ben Foster Giovanni Ribisi. Now playing in New Jersey.

RATING R (language violence) BOTTOM LINE Substandard fare with more moodiness than action and Wahlberg wasted in a do-nothing role CAST Mark Wahlberg Ben Foster Kate Beckinsale Giovanni Ribisi LENGTH 149 After a long run of serious movies like ""War Horse"" and ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"" I was looking forward to ""Contraband"" starring Mark Wahlberg as a reformed smuggler reluctantly pulling one last job. Everyone needs a little action now and then right? Unfortunately a little action is all youll get. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? ""Contraband"" is a sub-par crime flick based on the 2008 Icelandic thriller ""Reykjavik-Rotterdam"" whose star Baltasar Kormakur directs the American version. He takes the job way too seriously. All the ingredients for a satisfying slice of pulp are here -- tattooed baddies ruthless mobsters the pretty wife who needs protecting -- but ""Contraband"" is so busy establishing a dark mood of menace that it keeps forgetting to deliver the goods. Wahlberg seems oddly emasculated as Chris Farraday a security-systems technician doting husband to Kate (Kate Beckinsale) and father of two darling boys. Chris and his buddy Sebastian (Ben Foster) were once ""the Lennon and McCartney of smuggling"" as someone says -- a somewhat inscrutable comparison -- but you wouldnt know it. Even when Chris joins Kates brother Andy (Caleb Landry Jones) on a smuggling run aboard a Panama-bound freighter he spends more time casually swabbing the decks than swinging from the masts. The other stock characters dont do much more. Giovanni Ribisi plays drug-dealer Tim Briggs as a yowling tomcat but his claws seem clipped; Diego Luna appears briefly as a nutcase who supposedly chops off heads but never does any such thing. Lukas Haas as Chriss loyal cohort mostly cowers in corners as things go south. VideoMark Wahlberg in Contraband In a way ""Contraband"" fails by overreaching It aspires to the heightened drama of ""The Departed"" but lands instead in the bargain bin of forgettable action product. advertisement | advertise on newsday PLOT A reformed smuggler helps a desperate relative by taking one last job.

Stephen Cole The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jan. 13 2012 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 224PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The fates enjoy ironic twists almost as much as robbers like open vaults. And youd think by now movie crooks wouldve figured out it is simply bad luck trying to pull off ""one last job."" Those famous last words ensure calamity - the stalling of the getaway car or a spooked accomplice getting greedy. Screen grab from the online trailer for the film ""Contraband"" starring Mark Wahlberg and Kate Beckinsale Movies Contraband The official trailer Our latest example is Contraband a fast-simmering crime potboiler with Mark Wahlberg doing most of the splashing around. Wahlberg is Chris Farraday a New Orleans security contractor forced back to a life of crime to square family accounts with a drug dealer (Giovanni Ribisi). According to fellow crooks Chris was once ""the Houdini... the Lennon and McCartney of smuggling""- an intriguing cocktail of talents for sure. Hes also one cocky little Irish rooster with a crew as tight as his T-shirts. ""Have you ever been convicted of espionage sedition or treason?"" a bored law official asks him early on his final misadventure. ""Together?"" Chris says with a smirk. Wahlbergs character clearly enjoys getting back in the game. And after watching Tom Cruise make heroism look like torture in the latest Mission Impossible its fun seeing a relaxed confident action star go about his business. Chriss crime comeback appears to be going well too. Hes off to Central America running counterfeit money out of Panama. But then our hero makes his mistake advising wife Kate (Kate Beckinsale) ""Nothing is going to go wrong I promise."" This is it - the last job. Sure enough Chris is soon confronting the combined forces of Panama New Orleans and Murphys Law - the rule that states that anything that can possibly go wrong with a last heist generally does. Based on a 2008 Icelandic film Reykjavik-Rotterdam Contraband is careful to work Wahlbergs regular-guy charm. Early on Chris and Kate attend a wedding. Open bar anything you want to drink. No vodka and cranberry for Chris however. He orders Schlitz the beer that made Milwaukee famous. And drinks it right out of the can The film also has a good running gag about a stolen Jackson Pollock painting that is mistaken at one point for a splattered tarp. Contraband would be even more fun if filmmaker Baltasar Kormakur (star of Reykjavik-Rotterdam) could have figured out what to do with co-star Beckinsale. While Chris is committing piracy on the high seas shes left at home being guarded by a twitchy pal of Chriss named - uh-oh - Sebastian (Ben Foster). Playing a blonde with her roots showing Beckinsale seems up for a scrap but the film gives her nothing to do but get clobbered. The rest of the cast delivers broad flavourful performances. Ribisi connects as the sadistic drug kingpin dawdling on his line readings with an elastic Southern drawl as if he researched his role watching Strother Martin bully prison gang crews in Cool Hand Luke. Marks older brother Robert Wahlberg is properly haunting as a morose Irish Terminator. Elsewhere J.K. Simmons and Diego Luna ( Y tu mama tambien) show up in effective cameos. Contraband also has a good churning rhythm-and-blues soundtrack with Crawling King Snake John Lee Hookers hoodoo voice creeping out of theatre speakers. Though it never quite has us by the lapels the film is a solid workmanlike action flick. Although one could argue it would go down better at home on a DVD with your feet up on the coffee table. And a cold can of beer in hand.

"Mark Wahlberg packs a punch in Contraband Review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Mark WahlbergMark Wahlberg packs a punch in Contraband ReviewAn action-packed smuggling setup starring Mark Wahlberg Giovanni Ribisi and Ben Foster Contraband thrills although too many loose ends threaten to sink the boat.January 13 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Mark Wahlberg left and Ben Foster are shown in a scene from ""Contraband."" (Patti Perret / Universal...)""Contraband"" starring the rock-steady Mark Wahlberg is about a high-risk high-seas heist involving a supertanker that is so super complicated (implausible?) that in the wrong hands it would be laughable. Instead this very gritty bit of greased action does a decent job of shaking the sluggish out of January. Based on the 2008 Icelandic thriller ""Reykjavik-Rotterdam"" the filmmakers have turned up the heat a both literally and figuratively a shifting it from icy Nordic seas and alcohol trafficking to set things in New Orleans with a Panama port of call and a few million counterfeit dollars on the horizon. Baltasar Kormakur who starred in the Nordic version came onboard to direct the U.S. film which he has pulled off at least as efficiently as the heist at the heart of ""Contraband."" Everyone in ""Contraband"" it seems has dirty hands and smuggling on the mind even Wahlbergs Chris Farraday a legendary contraband man whos gone straight to keep wife Kate (Kate Beckinsale) and the kids safe from the criminal element. Chris soon finds himself back in hot water when Kates younger brother Andy (Caleb Landry Jones) gets involved in a drug-running scheme that goes bad (are there any other kind?) with Chris called on to pick up the bill to save him. Not having millions in the bank account Chris falls back on what he knows best a a smuggling scheme that has trouble written all over it. To keep things dark and the threat ever present the filmmakers have packed this boat with a whole lot of crazy starting with Giovanni Ribisi as Tim Briggs a nasty piece of work as the local drug boss. Meanwhile Sebastian Abney (Ben Foster) runs a cement business and despite all his 12-step confessing and best-friend sincerity you can guess how that will play out. The plot follows the basics of any solid run-and-gun theft story Chris has to get from Point A to Point B and back again with the goods and without getting caught. Complicating things because the smuggling game is nothing if not fraught with complications Chris is trying to take the high road a no drugs moved just money a and no one waiting for the payoff has any patience especially Tim. At risk is everyone that Chris cares about a wife boys young Andy and his own very tough skin. Wahlberg has a way of making lethal look neighborly and necessary which he does here. Hes also an actor that has a natural guys guy chemistry with well guys and a back-burner sexuality with women that can be turned up fast. Those qualities go a long way to keep ""Contraband"" afloat. Beckinsale despite her elegant lines does a good job as a tough chick in a tight spot. The director gives plenty of room to Foster (""310 to Yuma"") who continues to refine his vulnerable-crazy combo while Ribisi ratchets up his just-plain-insane side in a way that makes you wish someone would let him try ordinary just once. Its a carefully packaged ensemble of bruisers including J.K. Simmons (""Juno"") as the blustering ship captain intent on undermining whatever Chris is up to even though he has no idea what that is. Kormakur who does more directing than acting these days has an aggressive style a the action is hard-charging and the violence gruesome. Its all the loose ends in the plot that tangle things up landing ""Contraband"" just shy of smart enough. Screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski in his feature debut piles on a few too many new twists to the original that Arnaldur Indridason and Oskar Jonasson penned for ""Reykjavik."" (The three share ""Contraband"" credit.) It helps that composer Clinton Shorter (""District 9"") keeps the beat pulsing while cinematographer Barry Ackroyd (""The Hurt Locker"") has the cameras flying as the chasing and the dodging unfolds. The one hour that Chris has in Panama to go pick up the money in a distant barrio has its moments but what makes the action sequences so mesmerizing is the sheer size of the boats and all those containers stacked like tinker toys. That is the perfect staging ground for mayhem with such good clean lines for the lens to frame. Add to that the fact that U.S. Customs is tricked out like some elite hit squad a with slick Cigarette-styled powerboats helicopters cool camo duds and drug dogs that have junkyard blood in their veins in that more bite-than-bark way a and ""Contraband"" is an action-junkies playground.

Starring Kate Beckinsale Mark Wahlberg Ben Foster Giovanni Ribisi Diego Luna J.K. Simmons Lukas Haas William Lucking Director Baltasar Kormakur Running time 150 Release Opened Jan 13 2012  Editorial Review Chugging along in Oceans wakeBy Michael OSullivanFriday Jan 13 2012""Contraband"" is like an ""Oceans Eleven"" movie minus the glamour. Taut and suspenseful for the most part the thriller substitutes a wily working-class Mark Wahlberg (as smuggler Chris Farraday) for George Clooneys urbane con artist Danny Ocean and replaces the globe-trotting milieu of casinos and museums with a gritty claustrophobic freight ship. Watching it leaves you feeling less buzzed than jittery and slightly nauseated. If the ""Oceans"" movies were martinis ""Contraband"" is a thermos full of coffee. In context thats kind of a compliment. ""Contraband"" is a remake of the Icelandic film ""Reykjavik-Rotterdam."" Directed by actor-director Baltasar Kormakur - who played the lead in the 2008 original - it has a gloomy propulsive working-class energy that feels slightly more European than Hollywood-y. If anything it might be too exhausting. When we first meet Chris he has left the smuggling game to raise a family and build a legitimate business in suburban New Orleans. But when his wifes younger brother Andy (Caleb Landry Jones) winds up in hock to a volatile drug dealer (Giovanni Ribisi) Chris is forced to take up his old ways to pay off Andys debt. Actually its more to keep Andy from being shot in the head by Ribisis Briggs. Playing against type Ribisi makes for a compelling and frighteningly unhinged villain. Briggs also threatens Chriss wife (Kate Beckinsale) and his two young sons unless Chris comes up with the money. As Chris might say whaddya gonna do? A quick plan is thrown together to hop down to Panama on the next freighter and come back with a pile of counterfeit currency. But the plan - to be executed by Chris Andy and a rogues gallery of blue-collar accomplices who work on the ship - spins rapidly and bloodily out of control thanks to almost unbelievable betrayals and complications that leave the mission and Chriss family in jeopardy. The plot also leaves a lot of dead bodies in its wake. ""Contraband"" is considerably more violent and even more testosterone-centric than any of the ""Oceans"" movies with the added distastefulness that almost all of the victims are anonymous Latino gangsters - collateral damage when things begin to go south during the ships nail-biting stopover in Panama. Apparently were not supposed to care about them. The body count however seriously undermines Chriss claim to antihero status. Although he doesnt kill anyone Chris has a lot of blood on his work clothes by the end of the movie. That said ""Contraband"" delivers certain rewards both expected and unexpected. Theres an especially clever plot twist involving a stolen Jackson Pollock painting that in the course of things gets repeatedly mistaken for trash. With the exception of Wahlberg ""Contraband"" doesnt boast any marquee names. Chriss accomplices in Panama are played by Lukas Haas Lucky Johnson and Olafur Darri Olafsson with a slight boost in star power from Ben Foster who plays his best friend back home. As Chris himself says about his crew ""Its no A-Team but its the best we can do."" As it turns out the boys get the job done. Contains violence frequent obscenity drug use and other lawbreaking.

Photo Mark Wahlberg absconds from a smugglers ship with Lukas Haas (left) and Caleb Landry Jones. ""Contraband"" aims to be dumb fun but gets only the first half right. A better title suggests itself but ""Paycheck"" was already taken. Mark Wahlberg plays Chris a professional smuggler turned security-systems expert in New Orleans who gets dragged back into the game for (groan) one last job. His motive? Saving Andy the dirtbag little brother (Caleb Landry Jones) of his wife (Kate Beckinsale). The kid lost some drugs he was smuggling for a local gangster. Such is the condition of movie tough guys that this heavy villain is played by . . . Giovanni Ribisi Phoebes krill-size brother from ""Friends."" PHOTOS MARK WAHLBERG AND OTHER ACTORS PRODUCING THEIR OWN MOVIES Wait it gets better Chris steely eyed best friend is um Ben Foster the ""X-Men"" angel and dreamy little art student from ""Six Feet Under."" Not exactly Robert Mitchum and Harvey Keitel are they? Staple them together and maybe youd have a decent-size waterboy. Ribisi tries to get all rough with Beckinsale and you wonder why she doesnt just step on him. When he and Foster stare each other down its like Pee-wee Herman versus Urkel. Jack Warner would have fired anyone who proposed giving these two feather dusters the gunplay and smacking-around duties. But today Hollywood is run by agents and a documentary about the reps in question pitching the dangerousness of Giovanni Ribisi and Ben Foster would have been far more entertaining than ""Contraband."" Though Wahlbergs Chris doesnt seem to care about his sniveling brother-in-law much (neither does the movie which barely notices him) he agrees to put his life on the line and leave his wife and kids unprotected to try to repay the Ribisi character for the guys mistake. So he manages to slip onto a freighter headed to Panama. The ships captain (J.K. Simmons) who is supposed to be a wily vet who tangled with Chris smuggler dad is so dumb he doesnt even know who is on his ship when he leaves port. And discovering Chris is there for no apparent purpose except smuggling he does nothing except order him to clean the floors. Chris instantly schemes to line up with an entire crew of fellow crooks who agree to help him pick up a huge load of counterfeit US money in Panama City. This is a city where apparently a guy can just walk in unannounced on a counterfeiting factory and start chatting up the boss (Diego Luna). Conveniently thanks mainly to the incompetence of this crime boss Chris gets to reap the benefits of a shootout without actually doing much of anything. Then he basks in the incompetence of the ships captain who is too clueless to see how badly hes getting played. Watching a hero progress due in large part to lucky breaks and idiot moves by others does not a movie make. Meanwhile back home the wife is getting terrorized by the drug dealer in a move that seems unlikely to help Chris complete the mission but seems likely to severely annoy him if he ever gets back. Youd think the presence of an actress as talented as Beckinsale means her character would have something to do other than scream and plead for mercy but youd be wrong. Until the last five minutes when the twists click (or clunk) into place its puzzling why anyone considered this script worth shooting. But even if you think the finale is clever a sweet dessert doesnt make up for a meal in which every course was burned.

Starring Mark Wahlberg and Kate Beckinsale. Directed by Baltasar Kormakur. (R. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Were not going to get anywhere if were not honest with each other so lets start by admitting three things that ""Contraband"" is a ridiculous movie that it wasnt meant to be a ridiculous movie and that its an enjoyable movie. One of the things that makes it enjoyable is that its so ridiculous. It is Mark Wahlbergs lot in life to be consistently cast as the lone smart guy in an environment that produces only stupidity such that his characters cant even recognize colossal world-class idiocy for the novelty it is but only as one more nuisance in a harried life. Here he plays a genius-level smuggler who has gone straight but who is dragged back to do one last job. His young brother-in-law who has the brains of a distracted paramecium has gotten into 750000 worth of debt and Chris (Wahlberg) has to pay the money back. If he doesnt the mob will wipe out his family. Yes every last one of them. And wouldnt that be awful right? Related Stories Contraband forgettable ridiculous fun Review Contraband ""Contraband"" is based on an Icelandic movie ""Reykjavik-Rotterdam"" which I unaccountably missed despite my strenuous efforts to keep up with Icelandic cinema but heres the interesting thing Baltasar Kormakur who directed the American version apparently did not direct the Icelandic version but he did star in it. Which means that in order to pay it forward Wahlberg needs to direct it somewhere else and on and on until every country has a version of this thing. So our hero and a crack team of crooks get jobs on the crew of a cargo ship with the intention of smuggling counterfeit currency from Central America. From there most of the movie takes place in two locations following the smugglers efforts in Panama and showing how back home Chris wife (a blond Kate Beckinsale) keeps getting harassed and threatened by a mobster. The mobster is played by Giovanni Ribisi who is so unkempt and creepy here that he makes Ratso Rizzo look like Fred Astaire. For the audience its impossible to keep track of the caper because the movie never tells us how the smuggler does what he does. The best guess is that the screenwriters have no idea either because half of what he does just cant be done. However because linear sense is not really an aspiration of the filmmakers its absence is not a real problem. Heres the thing You may notice that in between laughing at ""Contraband"" youll be leaning forward a little in your seat and worrying about the characters and even laughing in a few places where youre supposed to. (Theres a great running bit about a stolen Jackson Pollock that every moron here thinks is a painters tarp.) And you may appreciate Wahlbergs steadiness as an actor his ability - in a routine paycheck like this - to convey dread or contempt or even philosophical weariness with a glance.

In fact it lingers through most of the movie which centers on high-seas smuggling double-crossing and far-fetched contrivances.The best thing about the film directed by Baltasar Kormakur is its atmospheric locations --New Orleans and Panama -- which help ground the story.VIDEO Wahlberg Ribisi and Foster talk ContrabandMORE Mark Wahlberg trades golf and glam for kidsBut the ""one last job"" trope is a particularly tired one.Wahlberg is in super-invincible mode playing Chris a former master smuggler turned family man. He installs burglar alarm systems now that hes married to Kate (Kate Beckinsale) and has two interchangeably adorable boys.About the movieContraband  out of fourStars Mark Wahlberg Kate Beckinsale Ben Foster Giovanni Ribisi Lukas Haas Diego Luna DirectorBaltasar Korm?kurDistributor Universal Pictures Rating R for violence pervasive violence and brief drug use Running time 1 hour 49 minutes Opens Friday nationwideThe movies worst offender in every sense is Giovanni Ribisi ridiculously mannered as Tim a mega-tattooed bad guy. His odd high voice is like nails on a chalkboard. Though his ferocity is meant to come off as unhinged and terrifying it registers mostly as annoying. Theres nothing all that new in his poseur-psycho repertoire.If it werent for his foolish twerp of a brother-in-law Andy (Caleb Jones) Chris life of non-crime would be one of blue-collar bliss. But Chris must help save Andy who botched a job running drugs for Tim. Andy offers to leave town which seems like the smartest idea the clueless punk ever came up with. But family ties run deep. And if he did bolt there wouldnt be a movie.Chris steps in to pull one last cargo-smuggling job to get the creeps off Andys back. He and buddy Sebastian (Ben Foster) hatch a plan for Chris to travel to Panama to buy counterfeit bills. Chris boards the ship as a worker and enlists some cronies to help him hide the phony loot on the ship.The vessel docks briefly and Chris Andy and Danny (Lukas Haas) head for the seediest part of town to grab the faux cash. The ship is supposed to take off in ""minutes"" but the guys must inspect the bills in one place then go find better ones in a massive compound belonging to Gonzalo (Diego Luna) a gang boss. But getting the phony money gets more complicated as Gonzalo forces the guys to assist him in an armored-car takedown. .The formulaic story and far-fetched moments are offset by visual flourishes amid a jittery handheld camera style. But the dark palette meant to be gritty mostly just makes the players look sleep-deprived.Contraband has a few moments of tension but it adheres to a predictable heist formula hardly worth trafficking in.

"Contraband Mark Wahlberg is our most effortlessly masculine actor. Slate Sign In Sign Up Contraband A Nonsensical Heist Thriller Partially Made Up For by Liberal Wahlberg Shirtlessness Contraband A Nonsensical Heist Thriller Partially Made Up For by Liberal Wahlberg Shirtlessness Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Jan. 12 2012 617 PM Contraband A nonsensical heist movie partially made up for by liberal Wahlberg shirtlessness. By Dana Stevens Mark Wahlberg plays a smuggler whos gone clean--before hes dragged in for one more job--in Contraband Patti Perret (c) 2012 Universal Studios. All rights reserved. Contraband (Universal) is a classic early-January release--the kind of middling-but-watchable heist thriller that days after seeing it already feels like something you caught half of on a plane two years ago. This story of a former smuggler pulled back into the business against his will is a remake of the 2008 Icelandic film Reykjavik-Rotterdam and is directed by that films producer and star Baltasar Kormakur. The setting has been moved to New Orleans and the broodingly handsome Kormakur has been replaced by the unbroodingly handsome Mark Wahlberg whose presence is the only reason to consider stirring from your post-holiday languor to see this movie. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. I wont try to make the case as Adam Sternbergh half-jokingly did on the Times 6th Floor blog early this week that Wahlberg has been cheated of his due as the greatest actor of his generation. Though theres no question hes been wonderful in movies as diverse as Three Kings Boogie Nights The Fighter and I Heart Huckabees Wahlberg is no accent-mastering shape-shifter no saturnine Leo Di Caprio or whimsical Johnny Depp What you see is what you get. But this true-to-his-word decency this simplicity is precisely what you cast Wahlberg for. I had plenty of time to consider the actors appeal during the unspooling of the otherwise nondescript Contraband and heres what I came up with Mark Wahlberg is attractive because he seems genuinely effortlessly masculine rather than anxiously compensatorily macho. You believe he could singlehandedly spearhead an international smuggling scheme while also believing hes a sweet vulnerable family man hopelessly in love with his wife. Liam Neeson shares this badass-yet-tender quality; its served both actors well in the current action-hero phase of their careers and (speaking purely as a film scholar) its catnip to the ladies. Chris Farraday Wahlbergs character in Contraband is the gone-straight scion of a notorious family of smugglers. At his friend Dannys (Lukas Haas) wedding the drunken reminiscences are all variations on ""Could this guy smuggle or could he smuggle?"" Chris now runs a legit business installing private security systems but hes drawn back into the life when his pea-brained brother-in-law Andy (Caleb Landry Jones) botches a job delivering drugs to a local small-time hood Tim Briggs (Giovanni Ribisi). In order to pay off Andys debt and keep the psychotic Tim away from his wife and children Chris agrees to pull off one last big job--no reformed criminal in a movie apparently ever having seen a one-last-big-job movie. Advertisement The resulting plan involves American currency counterfeited in Panama a getaway van in a storage container J.K. Simmons as a mustachioed ships captain and a stolen Jackson Pollock that at one point gets toted through a car chase and a gunfight giving new meaning to the term ""action painting."" This smuggling plot doesnt make much sense but its a lot more fun than the dreary back-at-home storyline that has Chris gorgeous but blank-faced wife Kate (Kate Beckinsale) getting threatened by the nasty Briggs and sexually harassed by Chris best friend Sebastian (Ben Foster). Contrabands problem lies in part with its heedless mishmash of acting styles. Beckinsale is inexpressive to the point of near-somnolence as if her character has an undisclosed heroin habit while Ribisi gives a performance thats so mannered and flamboyant its exhausting to watch. Tim Briggs is an interestingly non-archetypal villain for a movie of this sort neither a mastermind nor a thug but more of a straight-up scumbag a scrawny loser with a wheedling high-pitched voice and taste for other peoples pain. But Ribisi is way too pleased with the distinctive voice and gestures hes created for this context-free bogeyman. Tim Briggs seems to exist in a different movie than his fellow characters; in the few moments when hero and villain come face to face the contrast between Wahlbergs stoic understatement and Ribisis gonzo hot-dogging is comical. Theres more than one cause for unintended laughter in Contraband--including the cognitively dissonant fact that no one in Chris Farradays loyal band of co-smugglers seems to notice that his every idea backfires spectacularly. But there are also a few moments that provoke intended laughter among them some memorably filthy man-banter and a very funny twist involving J.K. Simmons in boxer shorts. If you enjoy watching Mark Wahlberg do that action-movie thing he does--a thing involving hidden cash belts and judicious ass-kicking and maritally sanctioned shirtlessness--you could do worse than to spend your next plane ride watching Contraband.

Patti Perret/Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Patti Perret/Universal Pictures Contraband Director Baltasar Kormakur Genre Crime Thriller Running Time 110 minutes Rated R for violence pervasive language and brief drug use With Mark Wahlberg Ben Foster Kate Beckinsale Giovanni Ribisi J.K. Simmons Watch Clips From Contraband - Lets Work Something Out"" Lets Work Something Out Credit Universal Pictures From Contraband - No More Options No More Options Credit Universal Pictures There are good movies there are bad movies and then there are movies that your parents rent two or three times before realizing 20 minutes in that theyve seen them before. Contraband the mediocre new Mark Wahlberg thriller falls squarely in the latter category -- not because its risible by any means but because nothing about it lingers not even the sulfuric stench of a bum scene or a particularly hammy performance. Its video box (or Netflix JPEG) will no doubt have its appeals -- Wahlbergs soft-on-the-inside glare scruffy men with guns the title font of an 80s Sylvester Stallone vehicle -- but dont be fooled. Youve seen this movie before even if you havent seen this movie specifically. In another example of Hollywoods desperation to snap up any successful properties no matter how marginal Contraband is an Americanized version of Reykjavik-Rotterdam a 2008 Icelandic hit starring Baltasar Kormakur. Those who frequent international film festivals might recognize Kormakur as the director of such eccentric little slot-fillers as 101 Reykjavik The Sea and Jar City and he steps behind the camera again here on a much larger production. Perhaps having Kormakur aboard promised some continuity -- because surely what works for Icelandic audiences will work for American ones too -- but his quirky sensibility gets lost in the rigors of a large-scale thriller. Still forgettable movies are rarely bad movies and Contraband has a diverting kick once its plot finally ambles into motion. Missing the belligerent edge that marks his great performances in films like The Departed Three Kings and I Heart Huckabees Wahlberg settles too easily into the role of Chris Farraday a reformed New Orleans ex-con who gets dragged back into the smuggling business. After Farradays screw-up brother-in-law (Caleb Landry Jones) gets pinched running cocaine on a freighter local baddie Tim Briggs (Giovanni Ribisi) threatens to kill him if he cant come up with the money fast. Leaving his legitimate home-security business behind Farraday takes responsibility for the debt and gathers his old criminal buddies for one last job smuggling ""funny money"" from Panama City back to New Orleans aboard a shipping boat. Meanwhile Briggs tightens the screws back home by terrorizing Farradays wife (Kate Beckinsale) and two children who in Farradays absence have only his recovering-alcoholic best friend (Ben Foster) to look after their safety. Once the action shifts to Panama City Contraband finds a nice groove eking out plenty of suspense as Farraday and the gang scramble to retrieve the payload before the ship weighs anchor. Kormakur and screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski keep throwing one obstacle after another in their way -- including an entirely separate heist -- while simultaneously turning up the heat on Farradays family back home. The raised stakes offer a welcome jolt of energy and introduce a tone of lighthearted derring-do thats absent from most of the movie. But aside from Ribisis typically bizarre turn -- his mush-mouthed Cajun accent turns every line into jambalaya -- nothing in Contraband pops like it should. Theres a modicum of local color to its New Orleans and Panama City locales but not quite enough. Theres a funny ingratiating Oceans Eleven camaraderie between Farraday and his associates but not quite enough. There are twists and turns and death-defying scrapes but not quite enough. Contraband is a film to be remembered vaguely.

Mad Libs have entertained people for decades and no doubt taught countless children the parts of speech but they seemingly also inspired the screenplay for this dreary generic movie. Mark Wahlberg stars as a brilliant [SMUGGLER] who is forced to commit [ONE LAST JOB] to save the life of his [BROTHER-IN-LAW] only to discover that hes being betrayed by [CHARACTER WHO SEEMS SUSPICIOUSLY EXTRANEOUS IN THE MOVIES FIRST THIRTY SECONDS]. Directed by Baltasar Kormakur (who played the lead role in ""Reykjavik-Rotterdam"" of which this movie is a remake) ""Contraband"" follows the gone-legit Chris Farraday (Wahlberg) whos forced back in the smuggling game after the weaselly brother of his wife Kate (Kate Beckinsale) gets into trouble with creepy criminal Tim Briggs (Giovanni Ribisi rocking a risible Cajun accent). The caper itself is only about two notches more clever than the one in ""Tower Heist"" (that titular crime felt like it was pieced together on the fly) the action scenes arent particularly interesting and the characters are all flat and uninteresting. And then theres the predictability of the ""surprise"" villain; I wont spoil it here but if you dont guess who it is well before the reveal then I sincerely hope you enjoyed seeing your very first movie. Wahlberg is seemingly incapable of giving a mediocre performance -- theyre either great in movies like ""I Heart Huckabees"" or ""The Departed"" or ""The Other Guys"" or theyre downright wretched as in ""Max Payne"" and ""The Happening"" and ""Four Brothers."" Add ""Contraband"" to the latter list. Diego Luna (as a twitchy Panamanian crime lord) and J.K. Simmons (as a humorless cargo ship captain) try valiantly to inject some spark of eccentricity into their cookie-cutter characters which is more than can be said for Beckinsale. Granted shes saddled with a thanklessly bland ""wife in peril"" role but if you thought she was phoning in her ""Underworld"" performances then you have not yet begun to be bored by her. The film seems loaded with missed opportunities -- Wahlberg and his crew are in a hurry to get the counterfeit money onto the ship in Panama before it takes off but Kormakur (who also directed the indie ""101 Reykjavik"") doesnt supply the tiniest bit of ticking-clock suspense. Nor does he find anything fun or novel about his New Orleans setting apart from the usual zydeco-wedding and seedy-bar cliches. First-time screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski throws in a clever running gag about Jackson Pollack and takes us from the bridge down to the industrial depths of a cargo ship but those are the only interesting tidbits ""Contraband"" has to offer. For the most part this is a straight-to-DVD movie that earned a theatrical release only by virtue of its A-list cast. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

(Video; Universal Pictures) By Joe Morgenstern January 13 2012 Only one thing moves slowly in ""Contraband""--a container ship whose cargo includes a potential fortune in counterfeit bills. Everything and everyone else hurtles along at breakneck speed leaving no time to dwell on the standard-brand plot or the surfeit of events--including an episode of being buried alive--that could fill three more movies. Yet the pounding pace is matched by perfect clarity; you really do understand whats going on and come to accept all sorts of preposterous stuff as perfectly plausible. This is an uncommonly well-crafted action adventure or an action misadventure given how much goes wrong for the resourceful hero. Its a genre film not great art though theres a good joke about art--a pricey piece of action painting appropriately enough--but its a thoroughly satisfying entertainment and in this season of lowered expectations a nice surprise. ENLARGE Mark Wahlberg in Contraband. Universal Studios Mark Wahlberg is Chris Farraday a master smuggler gone straight and determined to remain so; his performance is a masterly display of quick intelligence easy warmth and cool authority. Ben Foster makes Chriss friend Sebastian hard to read--intentionally and intriguingly so. Giovanni Ribisis psychopathic thug Tim has a chillingly pinched voice. Kate Beckinsale is strong and yet vulnerable as Chriss wife Kate. (How did they think up her name?) Caleb Landry Jones is Kates kid brother Andy a hapless fool who sets the plot in motion by forcing Chris to make one more smuggling run out of love for his family. (I told you the plot is generic but did I say it doesnt matter?) To prepare for the fateful run Chris rounds up a team of trusted professionals a la ""Oceans 11"" but theyre grizzled merchant sailors on a container ship under the command of J.K. Simmonss malign Capt. Camp that shuttles between New Orleans and Panama. A container ship turns out to be a terrific place to shoot part of an action movie. At least it is for the adroit director of this one Baltasar Kormakur and his cinematographer Barry Ackroyd. (The film editor was Elisabet Ronaldsdottir.) Shooting aboard ship means giving the audience a chance to see colorful men who know how to do skillful things and who do them with machines that fill the screen commandingly. (Watch out when a loss of hydraulic fluid sends the ship out of control.) Container ports prove impressive too what with their giant cranes and controlled tumult. The density of detail is extraordinary throughout--police cars flashing their lights like swarms of fireflies in the New Orleans night; the labyrinthine slums of Panama City; a psychotic counterfeiters lair (when this guy says hes thrown someone to the wolves he isnt speaking metaphorically); the fine points of counterfeiting. (If you plan to print your own money make sure you do it on starch-free paper.) ""Contraband"" was written by Aaron Guzikowski Arnaldur Indridason and Oskar Jonasson. Its an English-language remake of ""Reykjavik-Rotterdam"" an Icelandic thriller in which the director--who was born in Iceland--played Mr. Wahlbergs role. Of the Icelandic films that Mr. Kormakur has directed Ive seen only the creepily intense and extremely accomplished ""Jar City""; he has also done a couple of English-language films that havent set the movie world on fire. This one however should do very good things for his international career. His touch is sure in the action sequences and hes willing to dial the action back at crucial junctures for intimate encounters involving Chris his family and his incarcerated father. Instead of slowing the film down these scenes enrich it. Theres nothing like emotional substance even in an ostensibly unsubstantial thriller. Joyful Noise Watch a clip from the upcoming film Joyful Noise starring Queen Latifah and Dolly Parton. (Video Warner Brothers) The members of the poor mostly black church choir at the center of Todd Graffs would-be inspirational film lift their voices in song that makes you smile and squander their voices on dialogue that makes you cringe (but also smile in oddly pleasurable disbelief). Queen Latifahs Vi Rose Hill and Dolly Partons G.G. Sparrow have conflicting notions of how the choir should go about winning the National Joyful Noise Competition which is the movies pretext for everything that happens after the first two minutes. Vi is a traditionalist while G.G. the churchs longtime benefactor wants to shake things up. Feel free to guess which view prevails. One of the movies distinctions if thats the right word is its disdain for any details that might interfere with the musical numbers. The people who made it know we already know the hoary plot Theres a competition theyll win the semifinals then theyll go from their humble town in rural Georgia to glamorous Los Angeles and win the finals though not without some cliffhanging complications. As a result suspense plays second fiddle to the music which is a good thing since the music is pretty great though also to the two leading ladies store of folk wisdom. Thats no so good since Vi makes such statements as ""I swear your train of thought makes all local stops"" and G.G. issues such warnings as ""tryin to fool me is like tryin to sneak sunrise past a rooster."" Another distinction is the movies willingness to address Ms. Partons physical appearance by referring to it directly. ""I am who I am"" G.G. declares to which Vi replies ""Maybe you were five procedures ago."" Ms. Latifahs vibrant presence owes everything to her verve and vocal cords. When Vi lets loose with the gospel strains of ""Fix Me"" gorgeous music fills the air and alls right with the movie and everything else. The cast includes Romeo and Juliet surrogates played and ardently sung by Jeremy Jordan and Keke Palmer and Kris Kristofferson doing one of the weirdest cameos in movie history. Pina A couple of weeks ago after Wim Wenderss 3-D film about the late dance icon Pina Bausch had already opened in New York the Journals dance critic Robert Greskovic wrote about it in detail. Now that ""Pina"" is in limited national release as of Friday Ill add a few words of my own--not so much as a critic though I do want to discuss the use of 3-D but as someone who has viewed Bauschs theatrical works over the years with a mixture of excitement and bafflement. ENLARGE Ditta Miranda Jasjfi in Pina. Sundance Selects First the technology which enhances its subject as cinema technology rarely does. Using 3-D was a stroke of genius but only because its been used in such a self-effacing way. The sense of a proscenium is preserved more or less yet the invisible wall that stands between the camera and the dancers in most dance films disappears in this one. The 3-D camera gets close enough to the dancers to make them corporeal and place them in tangible space yet never intrudes on their dance. As for the substance Mr. Wenders manages a phenomenal trick of demystifying his subject (who died shortly before the film went into production) and preserving the profound mysteriousness of what she created. Pina the icon becomes Pina Bausch the enigmatic provocateuse who tells one of her dancers ""Dont forget you have to scare me"" and tells another ""Youre just going to have to learn to get crazier."" The images captured by the film--dancers in theatrical sets dancers in surreal exterior settings--are deeply scary for their loneliness and pain and crazily thrilling for the intensity of their joy. DVD Focus ENLARGE The Fighter (2010) Mark Wahlberg had long championed this story about boxing in a blue-collar Boston family and then when financing finally came through chose to play the role thats initially distinguished by its passivity. Hes Micky Ward a fighter whos become a punching bag but supports his family by absorbing physical punishment. Christian Bale is his trainer and half-brother Dicky Ecklund a wild-eyed crack-addicted caricature of the boxer he once was. David O. Russell directed a superb cast that includes Melissa Leo as the family matriarch and Amy Adams as Mickys tough and fearfully tender girlfriend. Laurel Canyon (2002) Kate Beckinsale plays opposite Christian Bale in Lisa Cholodenkos pleasantly time-warped romantic comedy set in a Los Angeles canyon where hippie culture survives in modern dress. Shes Alex a beautiful young scholar and the fiancee of Sam an earnest young psychiatrist whos more vulnerable than Alex knows to the ministrations of Natascha McElhones resident physician from Israel. The movies high point--its very high point--is Frances McDormands sensational performance as Sams mother Jane a pansexual record producer who cant suppress a nervous giggle when she introduces her strait-laced son to a gaggle of indolent musicians. Bringing Down the House (2003) Queen Latifah is Charlene a lusty prison escapee who employs an Internet ruse to invade the home of Peter Sanderson a repressed lawyer played by Steve Martin. Dont expect too much of Mr. Martin in this sloppy sitcom but do expect to be seduced and entertained by Ms. Latifah. Full-figured amply-fleshed and almost preternaturally--though not groundlessly--self-confident this rap star turned actress turned movie star makes the most of every moment on screen. She doesnt steal scenes; she simply dominates them. Adam Shankman directed from a script by Jason Filardi.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Contraband"" stars Mark Wahlberg as a reformed drug smuggler who must protect his family by transporting millions in counterfeit currency to pay off a psychotic killer played to the hilt (and beyond) by goateed tattooed Giovanni Ribisi. The film is a tense well-scripted remake of the 2009 Icelandic thriller ""Reykjavik-Rotterdam"" a fact worth noting because that films star Baltasar Kormakur directed the Hollywood makeover with extraordinary care. If youre looking for a lesson on how to set up an international smuggling operation and slip shipping containers full of dirty goods past U.S. Customs officers undetected this is the movie for you. Its like an exciting police procedural turned on its head. The new film sends Wahlbergs tough soulful ex-con from the urban grime of New Orleans to the outright squalor of Panamas Canal Zone to pick up a pallet of ""supernotes"" sophisticated counterfeit 100 bills that are almost undetectable. Both there and on the Louisiana home front where Wahlbergs wife (Kate Beckinsale) seeks protection with his best friend (Ben Foster) things go nightmarishly wrong. With its fractured cutting and darting camera ""Contraband"" makes no concessions to lazy viewers. Youll have to pedal fast to keep up especially in the early chapters. The dark and dirty cinematography and half-overheard dialogue establish a moody slow-boiling anxiety and require you to focus your attention. Even when youre up to speed the script keeps surprising you with how many of these dodgy characters have something to hide. Because the story is so well worked out you dont feel like youre watching congealed neo-noir leftovers but something fresh and exciting. As Wahlberg stumbles into each new level of hell the handheld hysteria of the camerawork ratchets up. Theres a tense armored-car heist in Panama thats almost an afterthought but its filmed with such sadistic immediacy that you cant protest. The movie keeps whipping you along. Its an impressive piece of work at once feverish and lucid.

More by Steven Rea Introducing Phillys Maris Curran director of Five Nights in Maine Jul 29 Weekend Movie Selections Jul 30 Bad Moms Mila Kunis and writers from The Hangover skewer the mommy wars raunchily Jul 29 Back in the day Mark Wahlbergs Chris Farraday was an ace smuggler - running illegal goods into the port city of New Orleans undetected and undeterred. More about Contraband >> But in Contraband a guns-a-poppin pulp remake of yes an Icelandic smuggling thriller Chris has gone straight. He has a home-security business a loving wife (a dirty blond Kate Beckinsale) and two young sons. Nothings going to tempt him to return to the dark side. Nothing that is except when his punk brother-in-law blows a big cocaine run and owes a local drug dealer a hefty six-figure sum. In order to save his wifes sib and get the squirrely tattooed thug played by Giovanni Ribisi to stop threatening his family Chris has to take on one last job and make everything right. Directed by Baltasar Kormakur who starred in 2008s Reykjavik-Rotterdam (in the role now belonging to Walhberg) Contraband is a by-the-numbers runaround in which anything that can go wrong does. And in which a pair of Hollywood hambones - Ribisi as the jittery helium-voiced Tim Briggs and Ben Foster as Chris lifelong friend and former smuggling comrade - chew up the scenery like they havent had a meal in months. (Ribisi and Foster twitchy and intense should have their own reality show we could watch as they compete for parts do screen tests and table reads and then go punch a tree or something while they wait for their callbacks.) A big comedown from The Fighter Contraband finds Wahlberg in default mode With his Popeye biceps and broody stares the actor can do a character like Chris without even thinking about it - and thats what he does here. Dialogue on the level of ""you gotta do what you gotta do"" and ""family is family"" doesnt help. Beckinsales Kate Farraday is a far cry from Selene the superpowered vampire she plays in next weeks Beckinsale offering Underworld Awakening. Mostly as Chris miss she stands around waiting for Ribisi to show up and scare her silly and wonders why she cant reach her husband on his cell. Thats because hes on a container ship bound for Panama where he and his cohorts are planning to acquire enough counterfeit twenties to stuff into a Mini-Cooper. (Thats a lot apparently and maybe the filmmakers tip of the hat to a far better thriller The Italian Job.) But the deal goes awry and soon Chris is helping a Panama City crime lord (Diego Luna) lighten an armored truck of its valuables - namely a big Jackson Pollock painting. For the rest of the film then the Pollock functions as a kind of running-joke commentary about the merits of abstract expressionism.

Share Tweet No one will confuse it with Maria Full Of Grace but like that more accomplished film about moving illegal material across borders the little-hyped Mark Wahlberg smuggling drama Contraband benefits from elegant simplicity. (Even its brown-paper-bag of a title gets right to the point). In a quietly assured effort director Baltasar Kormakur (101 Reykjavik) who starred in the 2008 Icelandic film (Reykjavik-Rotterdam) that inspired Contraband turns his films modest scope into an asset. Kormakur and his collaborators want to tell a simple story cleanly efficiently and with a refreshing dearth of frills. They more or less realize their aspirations because they aim so low. Wahlberg stars as a once-notorious smuggler who has traded in a dangerous life outside the law for a less glamorous but more stable gig running a home-security company. Wahlbergs tidy life becomes complicated when his fuck-up of a brother-in-law runs into trouble with customs during a smuggling run and ends up dumping an expensive shipment of drugs. Wahlberg consequently finds himself in the debt of a bottom-feeding drug dealer played with mustache-twirling abandon by Giovanni Ribisi and agrees to do one last smuggling run to Panama City to get his brother-in-law out of a jam. Duded out with facial and neck tattoos and a borderline-incomprehensible Cajun accent Ribisi delivers a frothingly over-the-top performance that seems to belong in a louder more obnoxious and generic action movie. With the exception of J.K. Simmons formidable mustache--Simmons is a lot of fun as a hardass ship captain--Ribisis performance is the only element of the film that calls undue attention to itself. Wahlberg is always better as a character actor than an action star but Contraband plays to his strengths by casting him as a fundamentally decent working-class man forced by circumstances into a desperate situation. Contrabands modest goals keep it from ever soaring too high Its pretty much exactly as good as it needs to be. Its little more than an effective genre film but in this era of bloated convoluted epics thats cause for minor celebration.

Comments (1) click to enlarge Contraband Video Rated R  110 minutes  2012 This no-frills heist thriller (2012) isnt completely devoid of merit director Baltasar Kormakur (best known for the Icelandic comedy 101 Reykjavik) brings a keen eye to the New Orleans and Panama locations and the cast (which includes J.K. Simmons Diego Luna and the typically solid Mark Wahlberg) is similarly inventive in fleshing out the familiar characters. But several graphically violent scenes of women and children in jeopardy make this ultimately beneath contempt. Theres no sense of consequence to the films images of torture--unless you count an absurd happy ending that has the victims family members making out with millions in stolen loot. This is the most appalling kind of Hollywood fantasy suggesting that even psychological trauma can be exchanged for cash value.

Contraband (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Contraband (PG-13) An unusual sense of humor characterizes this action-thriller about smuggling. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com1/12/2012 Editor rating 2.5 Contraband opens with one of those weddings that exists only to introduce you to the movies characters Chris Farraday (Mark Wahlberg) a former smuggler who is now reformed and married to Kate (Kate Beckinsale) but still orders Schlitz beer at an open bar because hes a real guy and mixed drinks are for sissies; his best friend and former partner in crime Sebastian (Ben Foster) who now works in construction and seems to be a nice cool dude except that Foster never plays dudes who are nice and cool; their dim-witted pal Danny (Lukas Haas) who has just gotten married and in practically any other crime picture you could immediately target him as the guy who will get killed during the heist that inevitably goes bad. But few things in Contraband play out exactly like youd expect. Yes there is an elaborate heist and it goes so disastrously wrong that its worthy of inclusion in the next Mission Impossible picture. But it is capped off by a terrific punch line that the movie patiently sits on for almost an hour of screen time. Contraband was directed by Icelands Baltasar Komarkur best known in the United States for the cracked comedy 101 Reykjavik which explains the touches of humor constantly popping up throughout the film. Without them the movie might have been a generic crime picture with stylishly desaturated colors and lots of handheld camerawork. But the off-kilter tone holds your attention and it extends to every facet of the movie such as a sequence depicting the robbery of an armored truck which begins as a brazen rip-off of Michael Manns Heat but ends on a much loonier note. Contraband follows Chris whose ability to sneak illegal goods past customs officials at the Port of New Orleans is legendary as he embarks on One Last Job. His wifes little brother Andy (Caleb Landry Jones) owes 700000 to a wormy drug dealer (Giovanni Ribisi) who doesnt believe in installment plans. So Chris and Sebastian hatch a plot to smuggle in a pallets worth of counterfeit dollars from Panama City which they could then sell to pay off Andys debt. Contraband makes good use of freighter ships dock workers and maritime laws to bring freshness to its admittedly stale plotline You can see the double-crosses coming like a bus barrelling down a bike path. Although Komarkur means business the director is definitely channeling the spirit of the Oceans Eleven comedies Theres a frothy almost whimsical undercurrent quietly bubbling beneath the dead-serious story and it finally bursts to the forefront in the ridiculously happy finale which argues without the slightest bit of shame that crime sometimes does pay -- really really well. The movie judges its characters not by the lawfulness of their actions but by the morals and scruples by which they abide (its the rare sort of film that treats reformed criminals with dignity and compassion). J.K. Simmons plays the ships captain who suspects Chris is up to something shady and is constantly dogging him. But theres something about the captain that makes his officiousness seem a tiny bit hypocritical. Like practically everyone else in Contraband theres more to him than meets the eye. There is nothing about the movie that is particularly memorable -- Wahlberg seems to have taken the part for the opportunity it provides to perform stunts -- and certain supporting roles serve no purpose whatsoever other than as engines to the plot (Beckinsale gets into so much trouble while her husband is away at sea her character might as well been named Pauline). But Contraband which is being marketed as an action-thriller is crafty enough to withhold its first big action set piece for more than an hour of screen time. Its a testament to the film that the wait isnt the least bit boring. Cast Mark Wahlberg Kate Beckinsale Ben Foster Giovanni Ribisi Caleb Landry Jones Lukas Haas J.K. Simmons Diego Luna.

While it presents yet another tale of a reformed criminal reluctantly taking on one last job in order to be free of the underworld forever (a plot that may outlast the cockroaches) Contraband has at least somewhat of a fresh angle. It involves big time smuggling via cargo ship an unfamiliar scenario which blows the doors off ye old bank heist in terms of visual intrigue. Once while working as an able seaman our hero Chris Farraday (Mark Wahlberg) successfully snuck every manner of thing into his home base of New Orleans. After acquiring a family he quit though five minutes into the movie it is clear anchors will soon be aweigh yet again. The reason is to save the life of his nimrod brother-in-law Andy (Caleb Landry Jones) who tried his hand at smuggling bungled it badly and elicited the wrath of a tattooed villain named Tim Briggs (an unrecognizable Giovanni Ribisi chewing uncomfortably on a Cajun accent). Andy who looks so young he ought to be smuggling Clearsil not drugs has a 700000 price on his head. The old adage ""family is family"" lands Chris on a ship for Panama hoping to bring back a pallet of counterfeit money. His crew includes an anxious newlywed the ships engineer and a funny cook. ""Its not the A-team but its the best we can do"" Chris says. Meanwhile Chriss best friend and former partner Sebastian (Ben Foster) stays behind in New Orleans in charge of protecting his wife Kate (Kate Beckinsale a sexy foil for Wahlberg) and their two young sons; the menacing Briggs is practically salivating over the chance to hurt them in lieu of Andy. (READ 10 Questions for Mark Wahlberg) The interplay between Wahlberg and Foster and then Ribisi is nicely done but the action in and around the cargo ship is where the movies real fun lies. There is plenty of guy humor - Chris always known as the Houdini of smugglers gets dubbed the Rug Doctor after the cantankerous Captain (J. K. Simmons in fine officious form) demotes him to carpet cleaning -- and lively action. In one of the films real money shots director Baltasar Kormakur a sometimes actor who starred in the film that provided the basis for this one sends the ship careening toward a Panamanian dock a giant battering ram that no one can stop or slow due to a mechanical failure. Its muscle mania there on the deck as Chris wields a hammer to free a stuck anchor. Wahlberg is a fine actor (The Departed) and capable of giving truly sensitive performances (The Lovely Bones and The Fighter) but let us not overlook the continuing magnificence of his biceps. Kormakur has worked steadily in his native Iceland since his 2000 debut 101 Reyjkavik but is just now making a leap to Hollywood. He plays with handheld shots and cuts back and forth so rapidly he threatens the storys coherence time and again but keeps it just this side of comprehensible; the results are an engaging patchwork of excitement and urgency. You know how you worry about getting to the airport on time? At least you dont have Chriss insane Panama itinerary to worry about. While navigating unfamiliar slums he must manage his idiotic brother-in-law avoid torture by a Panamanian madman (Diego Luna) and come home with the goods all within an hour. Theres even a diversion involving of all things a Jackson Pollock. Is the Pollock theft a bit too much? The absurd bloodbath involved in getting it is but is endurable for the ensuing gag about the 140 million painting continually being mistaken for a dirty old tarp. Contrabands sense of humor is charmingly macho real meat and potatoes stuff. Literally. ""Oh I just stole some decent beef"" says Tarik airily when a guard asks why hes mucking about amongst the containers. The guard grunts with pleasure as he walks off; a little criminality in service of the stomach is all right with him. The movie is an easy pleasure every domino falls into place. Chris and gang arent the A-Team but they get more than a passing grade. LIST The All-TIME 100 Movies Mary Pols MaryPols Mary Pols has been reviewing film and occasionally books for TIME since 2009.

He shoots the same way in every film - and every film has the same poorly written script and lazily shot scenes. Hes lucky he made friends with Wahlberg - his last US film was equally boring and hard to swallow. Laurasaid on Sunday March 04 2012 123652 AMI dont see how everyone here says it was boring. Sure I didnt love it as much as RR...I think its a movie that has been done many times before. But the performances are good (I wish Ben Foster would choose better scripts sometimes since he is a great talent) and the story does keep moving at a brisk pace. I think some people need blood and guts in every scene in order to be entertained. It was good popcorn fare.

Contraband Fair Director Baltasar Kormakur. Cast Mark Wahlberg Giovanni Ribisi Ben Foster. Rating R for violence pervasive language and brief drug use. This weeks new movie releases Spotlight Mark Wahlberg Damning with faint praise? Sure why not? Its better than no praise at all and certainly could have applied to a movie like this. But a willing cast led by Mark Wahlberg as the bad guy gone straight who has to pull off one ... more ... job and abetted considerably by Giovanni Ribisi as a dependably unhinged lunatic makes the film a lot better than it could have been. Dont misunderstand this is still a shoot-em-up with plot elements that stretch nearly to the breaking point. (It seems to have borrowed a lot from the television series ""24"" in terms of how long it takes to drive from one place to another with some distances covered so quickly the trips in real life would have taken a transporter from ""Star Trek."") But director Baltasar Kormakur -- who starred in the original Icelandic version in 2008 titled ""Reykjavik-Rotterdam"" -- rarely lets things slow down which is a good thing because any extra time to think would be fatal. Chris Farraday (Wahlberg) is a legendary smuggler who has gone straight starting his own alarm-system company (ironic presumably but who would know more about alarms?). Back in the day he teamed with best friend Sebastian (Ben Foster); together the two were ""the Lennon and McCartney of smuggling"" an admiring friend says. But Farraday has a wife Kate (Kate Beckinsale) and two sons now and hes living the straight life. Until that is Kates nitwit younger brother Andy (Caleb Landry Jones) botches a drug-smuggling job for Tim Briggs (Ribisi) a hilariously over-the-top bad guy who promises to dispense with Andy if he doesnt come up with the 700000 the drugs were worth. So Chris is dragged back into the smuggling game needing to get 15million in counterfeit bills out of Panama to settle the score. I know little about math and less about smuggling but the exchange rate seems a bit steep. Even for counterfeit money? Soon Sebastian and Chris jailed father (William Lucking) have managed to get Chris on a cargo ship bound for Panama complete with a few key crew members who are in on the job. Not however the ships captain played by J.K. Simmons who displays a gleeful hatred of Chris because of a hinted-at past with his father. (If you havent picked up on it by now subtlety is not this movies strong suit.) Plot twists and betrayals assure that almost nothing goes as planned. After all this isnt the most dependable crowd around as thugs and lowlifes arent exactly the kind of people youd trust. Except Chris of course who exhibits a sort of honor among thieves refusing to smuggle drugs even though it would be easier and more lucrative. Foster is a really good actor and Wahlberg is always pretty good as the strong silent type -- silent until he hits you in the face with a hammer or something. (Presumably hes strong all the time.) But Ribisi has become the go-to guy for movie psychos giving everything to performances like this one or as Moburg the dissolute reporter in ""The Rum Diary."" Briggs isnt exactly a great character -- hes too cartoonish for that description to work -- but Ribisi makes him a lot of fun to watch. By extension he makes ""Contraband"" a lot more fun to watch as well.

"Contraband | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; contraband ) Contraband (United States/United Kingdom 2012) January 12 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Contraband is the kind of thriller that offers just enough in the way of effective elements to assemble a two-minute trailer. When it comes to a 110-minute feature however the sketchiness of the plotting and the directors lack of sure-handedness sink the project. By their very nature heist-oriented thrillers are intended to be erected upon a bedrock of contrivances but a skilled director can obfuscate this reality and make the whole thing seem like one long fun ride. Sadly in the case of Contraband the seams show. Either as a result of poor writing or sloppy editing glaring plot holes are never plugged. The films structure is haphazard the energy level is low the surprises are few and the ending is far too clean for such a messy motion picture. In short this is pretty much what we have come to expect of movies released in January (at least those that are not Oscar-hopeful holdovers from the previous year). Contraband is remake of the Icelandic film Reykjavik-Rotterdam. This movies director Baltasar Kormakur served as both producer and lead actor in the original so theres a solid connection. While Kormakur brings a sense of offbeat humor to the proceedings his handling of action sequences is suspect (they lack tension) and the story is frustratingly driven by characters doing moronic and short-sighted things. The screenplay could be smart but it isnt. The pace is uneven; only on rare occasions is there a sense of urgency and the ""nick of time"" ending seems like what it is a bad clichA(c). As Chris Farraday Mark Wahlberg adopts his usual low-key persona. Unlike Matt Damon who can ratchet it up for an action role Wahlberg appears capable of only one level. Guided by a strong director Wahlberg has shown impressive acting chops but Kormakur is not the kind of filmmaker who can cull the best from his leading man. As a result its difficult to warm up to Chris even though his backstory is one of redemption. Hes a former smuggler who for the sake of his loving wife Kate (Kate Beckinsale) and two children has gone straight. Despite constant temptations to return to a life of crime he stays on the right side of the law - until circumstances dictate that he backslide. Chris brother-in-law Andy (Caleb Landry Jones) who has remained in Chris old business dumps a load of drugs when his ship is boarded following an anonymous tip. The drug dealer Tim Briggs (Giovanni Ribisi) wants his money and if he cant get it from Andy hell move onto Chris and Kate extracting the payment in either dollars or blood. With the help of his best buddy Sebastian (Ben Foster) Chris arranges to reunite his old crew and head to Panama to pick up a load of counterfeit 20s. But the transaction is not without problems and back home in New Orleans things start getting ugly as Briggs begins a campaign of intimidation. Putting aside how little Wahlberg brings to Contraband as least the size of his role fits an actor of his high profile. Kate Beckinsale on the other hand is shoehorned into a part that defines the term ""underused."" Like many actresses of a certain age Beckinsale is finding it difficult to capture work of substance so she appears in productions like this to pay the bills. She has little to do here thats interesting she plays the dutiful wife she is harassed by the drug dealer and she is transformed into a plot device during the final act. Meanwhile Giovanni Ribisi seems to be enjoying himself playing the bad guy. I never admired Ribisi much in the early portion of his career but now that he has started taking more offbeat and challenging roles he has reversed my opinion. Hes easily the most enjoyable character in Contraband. (Although Diego Lunas wacko art-obsessed Panamanian gangster comes in a close second.) Contraband delivers what it promises... barely. It is a story about reformed criminals being forced back into the game friction with drug dealers smuggling and revenge with the requisite betrayal thrown in. It isnt made with enough style or energy however to be consistently engaging and the various comeuppances lack the full-bodied satisfaction one hopes for when a bad guy goes down in something like this. The film is a little below mediocre but par for the course at this time of the year. Its a forgettable time-waster that will be seen more because of a lack of viable options at the multiplex than because it warrants an investment of anyones time or money.

"Contraband movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Contraband Intriguing personalities animate a so-so remake a 2 1/2 starsJanuary 12 2012|Michael Phillips | Movie criticMark Wahlberg stars in ""Contraband.""Playing a reformed cargo smuggler sucked back into the game Mark Wahlberg is the star of ""Contraband"" a fairly entertaining remake of the 2008 Icelandic thriller ""Reykjavik-Rotterdam."" And a reliable star he is. Audiences develop relationships with actors over time through good scripts and bad; this ones neither good nor bad exactly. But Wahlberg has the presence the glower and the laconic line readings to guide us through a mess of pain painlessly.The faces you remember in ""Contraband"" however belong to two of the more indelible character actors in modern movies -- not the most versatile but when the roles call for it the skeeziest. Ben Foster the shifty-eyed psycho in the ""310 to Yuma"" remake plays the Wahlberg figures friend and partner in crime. A nasty drug lord owed money by the protagonists hapless brother-in-law is portrayed by Giovanni Ribisi. Foster and Ribisi beady-eyeing everybody in the same picture Its almost more weaseling than one picture can take.The earlier films settings were Reykjavik and Rotterdam; director Baltasar Kormakurs remake goes for New Orleans and Panama (largely with New Orleans masquerading as Panama). A botched smuggling job lands the brother-in-law on the wrong side of Briggs (Ribisi) forcing Farraday (Wahlberg) into a contraband job involving counterfeit bills to be fetched in Panama and hidden somewhere on the cargo ship back up to Louisiana. Kate Beckinsale is Farradays wife who gets roughed up pretty badly in ""Contraband.""The low-level strengths of the picture its stripped-down budget and rough-edged milieu are brought out and then undercut by Kormakurs penchant for hand-held telephoto lensing and jib-jab cutting. The technique is in the interest of you-are-there immediacy and tension but before long the camera movements play like tics and affectation. Its a pretty crazy and overstuffed story anyway though Wahlberg acquits himself forcefully and well. And yet Farradays just another piece of plot. Maybe we all are. But movies like ""Contraband"" arent really into existentialism; theyre about what happens when twitchy raging character men like Foster and Ribisi along with stalwart under-player J.K. Simmons as the cargo ships dour captain go up against a movie star assured enough to make a little something out of not much.mjphillipstribune.comContraband -- 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating R (for violence pervasive language and brief drug use)Running time 150Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesOn the PR trail with Broken City star Mark WahlbergJanuary 16 2013Mip TV Baltasar Kormakur Set For Icelandic Crime Series...April 8 2014Baltasar Kormakur Chats About Everest Vikings and On...January 31 20142 Guns Kormakur Set To Climb EverestAugust 6 20132 Guns adds producer Norton Herrick Denzel Washington...August 1 2012Find More Stories AboutMovie StarPanamaCargo ShipMark WahlbergTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0111-contraband-20120112,0,4388609.column",200,contraband26,contraband,chicagotribune

Heads get smashed kids are terrorized and a Jackson Pollock painting takes plenty of abuse in the scuzzy B-movie world of ""Contraband"" a reasonably swift and effective reworking of the 2008 thriller ""Reykjavik-Rotterdam."" Ditching its predecessors Nordic chill to focus on a sun-baked New Orleans-Panama City smuggling run this solid if disposable genre exercise maintains a hard-driving line of action and a commitment to one-damned-thing-after-another storytelling that carries it past any number of narrative speedbumps and preposterous detours. Canny star vehicle for Mark Wahlberg should deliver the theatrical and ancillary goods for Universal. Directed in a rough-and-ready handheld style by Icelandic multihyphenate Baltasar Kormakur (""Jar City"") ""Contraband"" reps an unusual case of a foreign-born filmmaker helming the American remake of a movie he previously produced and toplined (""Reykjavik-Rotterdam"" was directed by Oskar Jonasson). Working from a mechanically efficient screenplay by tyro Aaron Guzikowski Kormakur wastes little time setting up the circumstances that compel former world-class smuggler Chris Farraday (Wahlberg) to accept the thrill of one last job. A blue-collar Louisianan whos long since settled down with his wife Kate (Kate Beckinsale) and their two kids Chris is pulled back to the dark side by Kates idiot kid brother Andy (Caleb Landry Jones) who botches his own smuggling operation and consequently runs afoul of a local dope dealer (Giovanni Ribisi). With no legal means of raising the dough to bail out his brother-in-law Chris assembles a small team to board a Panama City-bound container ship and run counterfeit bills back to New Orleans leaving his family in the care of his longtime buddy Sebastian (Ben Foster). Intrigue mounts as Chris and his cohorts passing themselves off as shipworkers under the nose of the rightly suspicious captain (J.K. Simmons) stay barely one step ahead of discovery and capture. Once the men reach Panama and things go as wrong as they possibly can Kormakur orchestrates a succession of impossible risks and hairsbreadth escapes including a violent heist run by a thug from Chris past (played by a greasy Diego Luna) and several bit players who yell wave guns and keel over right on cue. Getting the money to the ship on time becomes a crazed exercise in creative multitasking and despite the routine nature of the mayhem the setpieces generate momentum not only through editor Elisabet Ronalds shrewd pacing and cross-cutting but through the pictures mildly amusing attitude toward its own beat-the-clock logistics. While the Panama-lensed portion offers no downtime with which to establish a real sense of place the local tourism board seems unlikely to embrace the national image presented here so pervasive and unremitting is the atmosphere of grungy violent depravity. That overwhelming mood of corruption and criminality extends to the Louisiana-set scenes Chris refuses to smuggle cocaine but as he soon learns those close to him arent nearly so virtuous. The films attempts to wring emotional drama from the spectacle of the endangered Farraday family often tilt into outright risibility most disturbingly with regard to Beckinsales Kate; the filmmakers were clearly enamored enough with the image of her head being slammed against a wall that they opted to use it twice. Fans of thuggish showboating will get more than their fill from the ensemble here Though they share no screentime Ribisi (only slightly less out-there than he was in the recent ""The Rum Diary"") and Luna seem to be dueling for the title of most menacing facial hair; Foster gets ample opportunity to unleash his inner hothead; and David OHara brings his Scottish brogue to the role of a lofty Louisiana crime boss. That leaves Wahlberg to stand up to all of them as the principled man of action and he carries the picture with ease and low-key charm in a role that slyly takes advantage of his own bad-boy-made-good persona. The lean but muscular production is most impressive in its scenes aboard the nearly 900-foot-long S.S. Bellatrix (for interiors) and a 325-foot-long vessel (exteriors) as Barry Ackroyds camera skillfully maneuvers its way through claustrophobic quarters and around shipping containers. Clinton Shorters music supplies pulsing accompaniment.

Daily Edition Login to download Contraband Film Review 400 PM PST 1/11/2012 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Gloomily atmospheric thriller of smugglers shuttling between New Orleans and Panama is both absorbing and contrived. TWITTER Mark Wahlberg stars as a retired smuggler who is forced back into the game to pay off his brother-in-laws debt and protect his family. The gritty style only accentuates the increasingly far-fetched dramatics in Contraband an involving atmospherically grungy mid-register thriller. The central device of a retired criminal being forced back into the game for a final job is recycled from countless previous films and TV shows while some key climactic developments feel variously forced and/or simplistically achieved. But the lead role of a working class former smuggler who dirties his hands again to save his family fits Mark Wahlberg like a glove and theres enough punch and rough stuff here to make this Universal release a moderate success domestically and better than that overseas. A life based on ill-gotten gains is par for the course for the Farraday clan; while old Pop stews in the slammer son Chris (Wahlberg) remains a legend even though he now runs an alarm installation company and his dimwit brother-in-law Andy (Caleb Landry Jones) triggers the new round of trouble by dumping a bunch of drugs into the sea just as hes about to be nailed on a cargo ship. There are so many Irish mugs running around here youd think were in Boston but its actually New Orleans a major port for all manner of substances coming in from Latin America. PHOTOS 20 Best and Worst Music to Movie Crossovers Unfortunately the lost stash was intended for Tim Briggs a crazed trigger-happy lunatic played by Giovanni Ribisi in such a wigged-out manner that it suggests the actor is advertising himself for any role (if there is any) Nicolas Cage declines. Briggs demands instant satisfaction for the debt so threateningly so that Chris realizes he has no choice but to pull a job himself and quick. This one too will involve a smuggling operation aboard a transport ship this one bound for Panama where Chris arranges top pick up a massive amount of counterfeit American currency. With best pal Danny (Lukas Haas) and the questionable Andy whos older sister Kate (Kate Beckinsale) is Chriss wife the old pro signs on to a vessel commanded by a stern captain (an amusing G.K. Simmons) with less than sweet feelings for Chriss notorious dad. With help of old accomplices Chris sets everything in place for the return trip which will involve hiding the sheets of counterfeit bills from the captain as well as from customs authorities. Panama is seldom seen in major films so sequences featuring the canal the soaring new skyline and reeking slums impart welcome color and visual interest. It is also here however where the plotting of first-time screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski and the sequence timing worked out by director Baltasar Kormakur get more than a little hairy not to mention overly convenient. After a meeting with a drug lord (Diego Luna) goes awry the Americans escape seems unconvincingly easy just as the motivating incident is outlandishly coincidental. On top of it all what Chris pulls off ashore is far too involved to have fit into the very short period of time before the ship is due to sail again; a sense of urgency is one thing but winding the clock too tightly can break the spring which more or less happens here. Back home more dramaturgic problems await as old ghosts come back to haunt Chriss best friend Sebastian (Ben Foster) whos supposed to be looking after his pals wife and two boys but does so in a way that would tick off most husbands. VIDEO Mark Wahlberg Plays a Father on a Mission in Contraband Trailer Contraband is based on a little-seen 2008 Icelandic suspenser called Reykjavik-Rotterdam written by Arnaldur Indridason and Oskar Jonasson director by the latter and produced by and starring Kormakur whose debut feature the madly original Reykjavik 101 arguably remains his best film. Despite the Gulf of Mexico settings the new film which is largely set at night retains a certain Nordic gloom; the visual scheme worked out with cinematographer Barry Ackroyd is dominated by glum grays and blues although the camerawork remains alert and alive to the alarming events that punctuate the characters lives with all-too-frequent regularity. Kormakurs unvarnished style on the one hand comes as a welcome change from both the slicker Hollywood norm and the more mannered antics of some young directors. At the same time however the images grubby honesty not only keep the films temperature on the low side but also make the overt manipulations of the story appear even more artificial than they might have otherwise. Kormakur set out to make a thriller with a semblance of a real-life backdrop and succeeded up to a point but the grit and pulp are like oil and water here. Conveying Chriss family commitment and professional toughness with equal conviction Wahlberg provides the film with a solid center. Looney is in full supply thanks not only to Ribisi but to Foster Luna and Jones while Beckinsale her innate classiness calibrated down a few notches has little to do but be supportive worried and eventually besieged. In just three scenes William Lucking as Chriss father creates an indelible picture of a defeated but still cagey old school Irish-American crim.

Yet whoever the hero is the genres defining characteristic is its no-frills dedication to delivering the B-movie goods to immersing us in matters of betrayal revenge vehicular mayhem and righteous ass-kicking. Given how low our expectations are -- or should be -- for January thrillers its always a pleasurable surprise to encounter one that approximates ingenuity or even a hint of wit. So I appreciated the showpiece sequence in Contraband in which a trim lightning-quick Mark Wahlberg cast as a retired smuggler whos drawn back into the game attempts to score a pile of counterfeit bills in the tin-shack streets of Panama City. Wahlbergs Chris Farrady heads down to Panama on a merchant vessel run by a corrupt captain (J.K. Simmons) to pay off a debt that his screwup brother-in-law (Caleb Landry Jones) owes to a drug lord (Giovanni Ribisi giving his tattooed greasy-sideburned version of a bad Marlon Brando performance). When Chris first sees the funny money that hes arranged to buy he knows that somethings off -- so he calls for a bottle of iodine a drop of which reveals that the bills arent up to scratch because they werent printed on starch-free paper stock. (Youve got to love the detail of the expertise.) He then locates the gangster with the real-deal fake bills played by Diego Luna the pensive costar of Y Tu Mama Tambien and Milk exchanging his sensitive aura for a gruff Che Guevara-as-sociopath makeover which he inhabits as if born to it. The gangster is a chum of Chris from his smuggling days so everything seems good -- until Chris discovers that his satchel of cash has been stolen at which point hes forced to assist in an armored-truck robbery that might have come right out of The Town. As Lunas hooligans pull a paint-spattered canvas out of the truck cutting it out of its frame we see only a corner which is just enough to reveal that its a Jackson Pollock (the painters name isnt mentioned). Then they hide the canvas in plain sight by using it as a back-of-the-van cover rag Its hilarious that a work of art worth 140 million keeps getting ignored by brutes who simply dont recognize what it is. If all of Contraband were that clever it might have been an honorable entry in the action-heist genre. As it is the movie directed by Icelands Baltasar Kormakur (its a remake of the 2008 Icelandic thriller Reykjavik-Rotterdam which Kormakur produced) sandwiches its good bits into a conventional macho pressure cooker. Kate Beckinsale as Wahlbergs wife keeps getting terrorized by Ribisi and others including a weaselly Ben Foster. The woman-in-peril stuff is second-rate giving off a whiff of exploitation. And the plot hangs on one too many blink-and-youll-miss-em coincidences. Yet Contraband while often grungy and far-fetched does keep you watching. And in January thats recommendation enough.

Chris Farraday (Mark Wahlberg) is the retiree runner reluctantly reactivated a legend who once upon a time could slip anything into the Port of New Orleans but who has since gone legit for the good of his young sons and wife Kate (Kate Beckinsale essentially wearing a target through the movie). When Kates kid brother screws up a run for a roughneck drug smuggler (Giovanni Ribisi) Chris has to cover the loss by orchestrating and performing a comeback job running counterfeit bills out of Panama City. His old confrere and partner Sebastian (Ben Foster) is charged to look after the family while Chris is away.Contraband was adapted from an Icelandic original 2008s Reykjavik-Rotterdam (in which Contrabands director Baltasar Kormakur starred). The shift to the milieu of the blue-collar Big Easy is occasion for some bad accents though cantaloupe-bicepd star/ producer Wahlberg mercifully refrains. If ever an actor accepted and cultivated his narrow patch of range its Wahlberg safely staying in his wheelhouse here warily trundling into danger and delivering tough talk with his gasp-y rising inflection as though desperation were helium.The characters are immediately comprehensible. Chris despite his criminal history is principled--he wont import dope--and comfortable with his working-class Alpha status He orders Schlitz at a wedding open bar and still open-mouth kisses his wife on the dance floor. Sebastian in addition to being named ""Sebastian"" also raises an attentive viewers suspicions by giving his townhouse a Crate amp; Barrel makeover his aspirations of upward mobility a surefire sign in the movies world that theres something shady about that guy.The abiding tone of Kormakurs film is nervous prickly agitation regardless of whether the content calls for it. This fits with the frantic scenes of Chris planning and executing though in more slow-burn moments the energy manifests itself in the distracting tic of a twitchy zoom lens. Contraband is best then when it is keeping up with the nuts and bolts of criminal work while the job itself--sneaking goods onboard a boat under the noses of the crew with the help of a few friends on the ships manifest--is a novel one cinematically described.There is a nicely underplayed running joke in Contraband involving a stolen priceless Jackson Pollock painting that is repeatedly mistaken for trash by uncultured thieves and customs officials. No one however could mistake Contraband for anything but what it is a shift-job genre movie--not a bad days work content to match the blocky trudge of its star rather than attempt panache.
