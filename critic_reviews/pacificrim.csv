Warner Bros. Facebook Twitter Print Alien We Killed This City The monster that is Pacific Rim and the problem with Kevin Hart by Wesley Morris on July 12 2013 Once upon a time going to a mega-movie was a really big deal. The studios spent months winding up the audience with ads trailers clips and toys wrapped in plastic and buried in a box of fast food. People had dreams about characters built tents in queues outside theaters and dressed themselves as characters. Mega-movies were special for their size and scale and rumored expense. They featured state-of-the-art effects and maybe involved an alien invasion and were possibly directed by James Cameron. They also seemed relatively rare. Youd get maybe five a year and youd get that many only because of the cost and the risk involved in spending that kind of money. There was also the idea that not every movie should be an event that if you lost your mind every weekend of every summer youd have no mind left. So much for that. Now whether its because of our so-called Changing Media Landscape or because the monomaniacs who approve and finance our films are obsessed with making stuff that eats the entire planet things have changed. Events are all the movies have. The blockbuster threat level has gone from green to blue to Bruckheimer. The mega-budget superproduction owns so many of us. And if we must be owned and therefore deafened manhandled manipulated exploited 3-Dd and forced to watch entire cities reduced to crumbs then by all means that ownership should be entrusted to those more competent than mere professionals and more committed than certain glorified nerds. Guillermo del Toro is both -- a competent obsessive -- but he is also what these sorts of Trump Tower spectacles desperately need. Del Toro is a dreamer. Hes a visionary. If you give him a pile of money to make enormous robots fight enormous monsters at the end of civilization he will work to make Pacific Rim a movie that makes you feel all the enormousness. He will put you at the feet of the monsters and inside the bellies of the beasts. He will do what a movie about big reptiles and big machines is supposed to do make you look up make you feel as if the screen is grossly inadequate to contain whats on it even though if youre charmed -- or strategic -- youre already watching the movie on the biggest screen you possibly can. Del Toro will attempt to do this for us because many a movie craftsman had done the same for del Toro. Pacific Rim has been dedicated to the legendary creature-effects wizard Ray Harryhausen who died in the spring and to Ishiro Honda the pioneer who gave us among other kaiju movies several helpings of Godzilla. Its hard to describe the tingle of seeing a 100-story-tall object slogging across a skyline and the perverse yearning it provokes but after my first Godzilla movie I can remember staring out of windows in anticipation of something that would cause the house to rumble and the treetops to stir. The creatures in kaiju arose from atomic fear. Would Hiroshima and Nagasaki reoccur? But for a moviegoer lucky enough to be innocent of war and large-scale atrocity Hondas radioactive byproducts were just strange creatures -- like Harryhausens swashbuckling skeletons howling man-beasts and hissing serpents -- that flourish in the imagination like growing dinosaurs in a glass of water. His movies and their imitators had a strange power. I kept my face pressed against the window. Del Toro delivers the highest-tech tribute to Harryhausen and Honda one could pay. I find myself once again staring at treetops. Pacific Rim is set seven years in the future at a time of constant war. Massive monsters -- kaiju -- continue to rise up from Earths core and ravage the planet. To combat the threat man has devised comparably gargantuan machines called Jaegers whose pilots stand armored on a platform in the cavity of all that hardware and operate the robots virtually. For practical purposes these men and women -- brothers fathers and sons lovers -- are Jaegermeisters and the movie which del Toro and Travis Beacham wrote never tires of splashing the screen with the aftershave-blue montages of one meisters mind melding with the other. The human story proceeds in several directions. An American meister named Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) comes out of very early retirement to fight for a multinational outfit called the Pan Pacific Defense Corps whose commander is an Englishman and former pilot named Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba). Its right about here with the discovery of a name as stupid and amazing and amazingly Bible Belt porny as Stacker Pentecost that you have to suppress the urge not to watch the rest of Pacific Rim on a knee. Raleigh winds up partnered with a Japanese woman named Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) and sparring with a macho pilot named Chuck Hansen (Robert Kazinsky).1 The baldness of the badness that surrounds a lot of the writing and performing of these characters is reminiscent of Paul Verhoevens Starship Troopers. Like Verhoeven a Hollywood-friendly Dutchman del Toro whos Mexican appears to have had more compelling business to worry about than how people sound. But the nationalities arent entirely random. The film is nodding -- hilariously perfunctorily -- to global movie-attendance conditions by having the two best Jaeger teams hail from China and Russia which according to a Screen Digest report were 2011s second- and seventh-largest non-North American box-office markets. (Japan was no. 1.) Del Toro scatters the movie all over the planet in its metropolises its waters and beneath them. His nation-state placement happily makes concrete whats been obvious for so long Asias the new Coke. There are some good bits with the del Toro regular Ron Perlman as an oily operator selling kaiju parts on the black market. But the official comedy involves a pair of bickering PPDC scientists -- an overcaffeinated American (Charlie Day) and a limping most highly strung Brit (Burn Gorman) named Dr. Hermann Gottlieb -- eager to discover what makes kaiju tick. Its an achievement that calls for a kaiju brain which Days character a tattooed monster geek named Dr. Newton Geiszler spends the movie trying to procure. Day is as funny as John Turturro is in the Transformers movies playing a character who works as a broad outline within which he can try out a shtick. The skinny Gorman is even better. With his dark clothes matted hair and madman rictus hes like an SS commander outraged that no ones following behind him. A friend mentioned that the two scientists are like the robots in Star Wars and hes right. Theyre the custodial undercard in an Ernst Lubitsch comedy too. But these two do so much shouting at each other that by volume theyre also Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant in Bringing Up Baby. In Pacific Rim when two pilots suit up and are shuttled into a Jaeger the camera lingers over the gear long enough for you to appreciate precisely how battle-tested these machines are. You can see scuffs and rust and grease and dents. You see the wear and tear and surmise their use. You appreciate the details. They tell as descriptive a story as the creases on Brad Pitts or Judi Denchs face. Its a level of specificity that only the people at Pixar might care to top. With Pixar you expect that degree of granularity. Del Toro and his vast team didnt have to bother. But the bother becomes an endearment. So does the attention to the staging of the battles between the kaiju and Jaegers. The monsters have the dino-lizard quality you want. They dont have the hair and slime youd get from a Rick Baker or a Stan Winston. They have a clear ferocious Godzilla-ness that feels both absolutely referential and perfectly apt. Kaiju can rip Jaegers apart with their talons or vomit sizzling nuclear acid on them and are indiscriminate and promiscuous enough to chase anything that moves including adorable little girls. When kaiju and Jaegers go charging at each other in say an ocean or on the streets of some city you feel a perverse tingle of amorality. You crave the destruction. Youre riled up by the shredding in Ramin Djawadis score -- the guitars credited to Tom Morello whose history with Rage Against the Machine speaks to the sympathy del Toro evidently feels for the monsters. Pacific Rim is just as guilty of mass destruction and mega-budget cliches as Armageddon the Transformers movies and nearly every blockbuster to open in the last two summers. But del Toro doesnt turn real-world disaster iconography into kitsch for our entertainment. This isnt to say that the movie is free of politics. (With del Toro youre rarely far from them actually.) The Jaeger for instance represents a less morally problematic alternative to drone warfare. But del Toros work is more inspired than traumatic exploitation. Hes studied pop art and likes to reinterpret it. Del Toro has mentioned that he found inspiration in Goyas 200-year-old blockbuster painting The Colossus. I wouldnt put it past him also to have been thinking about Goyas gruesome remake of Rubenss Saturn Devouring His Son. (Maybe he already used that for Pans Labyrinth.) But watching the kaiju and the Jaegers go at each other inspires thoughts of a less passive masterpiece the boxers in George Bellowss Both Members of This Club a painting whose bloody monstrous boxers -- one man white the other black -- are made to look at least twice as large as the spectators surrounding the ring. Like other directors who dont seem alive unless theyre working on a massive scale -- George Lucas Michael Bay Peter Jackson -- del Toro can sometimes stall beneath the weight of his undertaking. The nearly perfect polemical Grimms fairy tale of Pans Labyrinth got as carried away with itself as his two Hellboy films. But what separates del Toro from those other directors is the joy he imparts to you. Its the joy of a filmmaker whos never forgotten that movies can do everything. It can make a Stacker Pentecost pre-battle pep talk seem vaguely like Henry Vs St. Crispins Day speech. It can keep you checking the skyline for imaginary dragons. The lasting image of Pacific Rim features a kaiju clamping its talons into a Jaeger and suddenly growing wings and taking off. All that airborne tonnage drops your jaw and waters up your eyes. On one hand its probably just somebodys computer. On the other its a miracle. Kevin Harts stand-up comedy is at its best when hes sitting down. His breathing returns to normal. His antic pacing and delivery are confined to his stool. He actually seems possessed by the memory of his jokes instead of pacing the stage in search of them. You no longer notice that hes another comedian who doesnt have the follow-up sensibility that bespeaks a kind of ingenious relentlessness -- Joan Rivers failing to run out of ways to talk about her lack of beauty or Chris Rock working his racial outrage down to the bone. At their best the great comedians go until theres nothing left until theyve wiped you out until you hurt. With Hart you feel like the shows over before it has even peaked. He feels his way from observation to anecdote to exclamatory riff to self-deprecation. When hes seated at least you no longer feel like you have to chase him in order to make a connection. Hes right there. People are talking about Harts two recent live-in-concert movies -- I use ""movie"" out of occupational habit; there were cameras present during his act; that is all -- as if those hits were Eddie Murphys Delirious or Raw. These people obviously havent seen Harts movies. The second Kevin Hart Let Me Explain which opened last Wednesday and was shot at a sold-out and acutely receptive Madison Square Garden is a mess. There are montages of fans screaming love support and thanks into the camera. Theres some man-on-the-street stuff. Theres a self-mocking introductory sketch. Theres a bit about the size of his YouTube Channel and the love for him on Twitter. This is always a dubious strategy for a movie. Were already here dude. We know. Somewhere in between there are the 52 or 53 minutes of Harts show which mostly concerns how lifes been for him since his divorce. Murphy who in Raw was at the peak of his fame made himself a sex symbol and rock star with these live shows. Hart is all too eager to undermine that kind of bravado. His stand-up made him a comedy star but the movies and television reduce him to stripping the ball from people more famous than he is. That was him uncouth in Soul Plane and characteristically aggrieved in Think Like a Man and picking fights with Robin Thicke on BETs Real Husbands of Hollywood. At 33 Hart could spend the rest of his career as a professional scene thief. But he has something more agitated than that. Hart shouts and wails and pants at a high pitch so that we know hes still there. Hes half the size of the people around him and seems both delusional and openly insecure. He has the bark of a dog that doesnt know it cant bite. Let Me Explain opens with a vague indication of the fun to be had at a real Hart movie. Hes at a rooftop party where people accost him with accusations. ""Is it true"" asks one woman rhetorically ""that you dont fuck with dark-skinned bitches no more?"" The woman is light-skinned and says shes asking on behalf of her friends who with a pivot of the camera are shown seething and eye-rolling in a corner as if they were Girlfriends zombies. ""Let me explain"" he says. Theres a charm in the way the accusations pile up and hurt his ego in the way he tells his incredulous manservant to call the Garden so he can get some things off his chest. Tim Story who made Think Like a Man directed that intro and its a barrage of personalities chafing against Harts. Its legitimate screwball comedy too -- hed be perfect for the Ernst Lubitsch undercard. You believe his sense of aggrievement -- not as a real superstar per se but as a caricature of one as a joke on someone like Murphy. Otherwise hes using the movies the TV shows and the concerts to inflate his ego. Even that feels dubious. In Let Me Explain the most adulatory post-show comment a fan makes about Hart is ""I loved him in Soul Plane definitely his best work."" But it doesnt have to be. Im mentioning the nationalities because Elba and Kikuchi are some of the few at PPDC whose accents make sense. Chuck and his father Hercules Hansen (Max Martini) sound British and Australian respectively but its Kazinsky whos the Aussie and Martini is American. Meanwhile Hunnam is British but he spends the entire movie sounding like Sam Worthington during the first hour of Avatar.

By Anthony Lane Machines battle monsters from under the sea in Guillermo del Toros movie.   Credit Illustration by Sachin Teng Does size matter? It does to Guillermo del Toro whose new film ""Pacific Rim"" pays homage to the humongous. So what if the script is feeble the plot is perforated and the characters are so flimsy that you wouldnt risk blowing your nose on them? The point is the fight between the big guys. Its like watching a pair of angry cathedrals going dome to dome. In one corner Kaiju--scaly monsters that rise from a cleft in the ocean floor and lay waste to large conurbations. When they roar which is most of the time their open mouths give off a bright-blue glow as if they had just breakfasted on a bowl of crunchy police cars. Ranged against them are the machines built by man and known as Jaegers metallic giants kitted out with missiles superswords nuclear reactors corkscrews bottle openers and so forth. Each is driven by two pilots one for each side of the devices brain. For added focus they are taught to meld their minds in a process known as ""drifting."" Funny. Thats what I was doing for most of the movie too. This is one of those well-drilled films in which each protagonist comes supplied with a small portable backstory. Thus Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) lost his brother in an earlier standoff with the beasts. Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) his co-pilot was orphaned in a similar attack. Then theres Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) who should be a Pilgrim preacher from 1683; in fact he is the commander of the Jaeger program although he is prey to ominous nosebleeds which can be a pain when you try to save the world without a handkerchief. Add a couple of quirky yet unamusing boffins a snarling father-and-son duo and some Chinese triplets and you end up with a rich variety of people not to care about. To be honest after half an hour I was rooting for the Kaiju. In terms of temperament they are unlikely to be mistaken for Roger Federer but theyre inventive and well travelled and their gaze and their gait remind you of the lanky faun--at once haunting and quizzical--in ""Pans Labyrinth"" del Toros great film set in the wake of the Spanish Civil War. The rough rule appears to be that his Hispanic movies such as ""Cronos"" and ""The Devils Backbone"" remain troubling and tight whereas when he steps onto Hollywoods patch--for ""Mimic"" ""Blade 2"" or the ""Hellboy"" franchise--the beauty of his images grows more fitful and our astonishment tails off. No genre is wilder than horror but none asks more insistently to be rooted in time and place and to be keyed to touchable objects. Hence del Toros fondness for clockwork and for mechanical thinglets that scuttle and click; the bugs in ""Cronos"" locking onto human skin were no bigger than a mouse. So what is he doing with a film about mobile mountains? The clue to ""Pacific Rim"" is in the title. It represents not just an important location for the plot (the Kaiju have their eye on Hong Kong) but a courteous nod to the market where films such as this are intended--or designed--to thrive. Overseas sales account for an ever-swelling percentage of Hollywoods box office and its naive to assume that forthcoming products will not reflect that cultural spread. That is why in this instance the stars are a melange of British Asian Russian and Australian some speaking with American accents some not. Whats more even as the story hops between Alaska San Francisco Sydney Vladivostok and the Far East you begin to realize that it could be happening anywhere or nowhere. Small wonder that it ends up beneath the waves. It is possible to applaud ""Pacific Rim"" for the efficacy of its business model while deploring the tale that has been engendered--long loud dark and very wet. You might as well watch the birth of an elephant. The new film from Nicolas Winding Refn ""Only God Forgives"" is set in Bangkok. His previous work the doomy ""Drive"" took place in Los Angeles. In both cases we get to share his peculiar vision of urban life. Here is no hive of human swarming; the major scenes contain only two or three people their unlovely deeds echoing in a carefully calibrated void. Cities appeal to Refn not because they draw a crowd but because they infect the soul. Where else can crime be guaranteed to break out and suppurate? From the start ""Only God Forgives"" is suffused with a sticky red light which brings with it the tint of a bordello and the shine of Hell. So often does it glaze the face of Julian (Ryan Gosling) our dolorous hero that not until halfway through the movie do we see his complexion in daylight. Julian runs a kickboxing club and deals drugs for a living although as ever in Refns world living is but a slow rehearsal for dying. One night Julians brother Billy (Tom Burke) rapes and murders a teen-age girl. Her father kills Billy with the connivance of the police and is in turn confronted and deprived of his right arm by an older cop Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm) who carries a long swishing blade for just such a purpose. The cycle of vengeance is already spinning; there are plenty more horrors to come one involving a wokful of hot oil. If you think that sounds painful meet Julians mom. From the top a tsunami of long blond hair Jackie O. shades pale-pink lipstick and tangerine nails dialogue straight from the sewer and a sideline in narcotics. Such is Crystal newly landed in Bangkok to avenge the death of Billy. Told of his misdeeds she replies with airy nonchalance ""Im sure he had his reasons."" The twist is that Crystal is played by Kristin Scott Thomas the doyenne of Anglo-French panache striding so far out of her comfort zone that the shock of recognizing her is greater (and more fun) than anything else in the film. ""Ill have the crab"" she says at dinner with Julian. ""And hell have the spicy chicken."" The poor boy cowers and wilts and you cant blame him. He has to endure not just maternal put-downs but a merciless barrage from the fists and feet of Chang who performs his savage acts with a high solemnity as if they had some sacramental function. At one alarming moment all the themes congeal. Crystal is cut and Julian like Doubting Thomas slips a hand into her wound. Is Refn really tendering his grandly named film as a religious parable? If so Ill pass. Directors who dramatize intense violence tend to distinguish--or betray--themselves less in the filming of the mayhem than in the styling of the buildup and where Tarantino perfumes his air of suspense with a long literate monologue preferably delivered by Christoph Waltz Refn uses a throb of patient dreaminess as heavy as incense but impelled by little more than a craving for cool. However mystifying or downright boring you find the result rest assured that the Refn faithful will swoon. Peace be with them. There are good reasons to see ""The Act of Killing"" a new documentary directed by Joshua Oppenheimer but pleasure is not among them. A more likely response will include convulsive nausea and disbelief. The setting is Indonesia where in the mid-nineteen-sixties a plan of mass murder was carried out against anyone suspected of being a Communist and against the ethnic Chinese. At least half a million died. We see no footage from that time nor do we meet survivors; rather Oppenheimer interviews a number of perpetrators who far from fearing exposure or justice are keen to discuss their deeds. And why not when the purges are still celebrated by a current government minister and even worse by the smiling female presenter of an Indonesian chat show? One of her guests is Anwar Congo whom we follow throughout the film. Elderly personable and light on his feet he shows us how to snuff out a life with a simple garrote of wire and a length of wood and he recalls his use of a machete for decapitation. When you recall that a similar technique was choreographed in ""Only God Forgives"" for the sake of aesthetic suavity Refns film becomes still harder to defend; and yet Oppenheimers work is itself subject to bizarre embellishment. He invites Congo and a fellow-killer Adi Zulkadry to restage--or reflect upon--their activities in any way they choose. We get musical sequences and passages of grotesque cross-dressing; scenes in which torturers play their former selves or pasted with fake blood and flesh their own victims; and the reconstruction of an assault on a village in which local women and children are hired as extras and left in traumatized tears. This is difficult to watch and by the end even the implacable Congo is affected retching and groaning like an animal at the acknowledgment of his sins. Yet the project gave me pause. Although Oppenheimer has called it ""a documentary of the imagination"" whatever that means would a measure of investigation have spoiled it? We hear that Congo personally exterminated a thousand people. Does that figure stand up and does it not matter more than his dawning remorse? There is no disputing that we are right at the heart of darkness but around it is a larger body of evidence which awaits another explorer.

I am really glad that all these people brought this film into being. It now exists and the Universe is a little bit more colourful and fun for it. Criticising the uneducated masses whilst also being a servile pawn/battery of the system just like the rest of us is a moronic thing to say by the way... LOL  clever Hatchet. Alliesaid on Friday August 30 2013 31012 PMIf you dont know how to spell ""puerile"" then you have no high ground to call people uneducated Hatchet. Timsaid on Wednesday August 07 2013 101604 AMThe movie is worth seeing thats the bottom line. Maybe you dont love the characters but thats not the real attraction anyway its the action sequences which are very good. Roeper gushed over Prometheus and gave it an A+ yet the character development in that movie was awful (but great visuals and also worth seeing). Very few movies are perfect but this movie does enough to earn a good rating thats the bottom line. Seansaid on Sunday July 28 2013 95837 AMPeople need to stop getting so butt hurt over the reviews. Mr. Roeper even said it was an entertaining movie. Sometimes you want to watch movies to feel inspired sometimes to laugh...sometimes you just want to watch a giant robot punch a giant monster in the face. This movie is cornily awesome but far from the MOST AMAZING movie ever even the actors would tell you that. Andrew Bsaid on Saturday July 27 2013 125440 AMHey Richard I just wanted to thank you for this great review and all of your other reviews as well. JBsaid on Monday July 22 2013 125141 PMFunny ""cyrollan""? I liked the film but I disagree with your ""factual opinion"" that this is the best movie period. Youre not ALWAYS right you know cyrollansaid on Sunday July 21 2013 45502 PMDear Richard Roeper you speak of ""5000 movies you need to see""... theres no way any of those beat Pacific Rim. This is the best film ever created. Argument over. Opinions do not count. This is factual opinion. grunt2502said on Friday July 19 2013 71127 PMIm sure this movie was made to entertain audiences with epic fighting between monsters and robots not a drawn out story about the characters. Chadsaid on Thursday July 18 2013 94321 PMI had a blast watching this movie. I completely understand you rating this a B while also describing it as ""ridiculously entertaining"" because it was. This was the most fun Ive had at the movies this summer compared to the other Blockbusters that have been released. Also Im a proud popcorn munching moron whether Im watching Pacific Rim or The Kings of Summer. Also thanks for your reviews I love when I agree with your opinions and I especially love when I disagree it really makes me think hard about what Im watching and why I love film. Cheers. Aaronsaid on Thursday July 18 2013 61814 PMGood review Richard. I loved this movie. The detail and originality was amazing.

On the one hand the cast is notably second-tier and the plot--giant human-operated robots fighting giant alien sea monsters off the coast of Hong Kong--seems like a cross between Battleship and the Transformers movies. On the other hand the movie is directed by Guillermo del Toro whose prior achievements--both pop-cultural (Hellboy) and high-cultural (Pans Labyrinth)--are beyond reproach. Adding weight on the negative side of the scale were a series of underwhelming trailers. But on the positive side again The movie is directed by Guillermo del Toro. Related Story A Punishingly Overlong Lone Ranger So now that Pacific Rim has landed ashore which is it? A feebly written special-effects-fest explicitly engineered for the international market? Or a work of next-generation visual imagination? The answer I fear is both--though the balance tilts somewhat toward the former. The story begins in the near-future when an interstellar portal opens up deep in the Pacific Ocean and belches forth a lumbering monstrosity that lays waste to San Francisco. Though this ""Kaiju""--the term is a genial nod to the Japanese giant-monster movies of the 1950s and 60s--is ultimately defeated by the military another materializes six months later and then another and another. Humankind quickly comes to the conclusion that (tagline alert) to fight monsters we must create monsters of our own--specifically towering mechanical men called ""Jaegers."" (The word is German for ""hunter."") This arrangement works out nicely for several years with the implicit contest between Japanese Godzilloids and German engineering consistently favoring the latter. But in 2020 the balance of power shifts as a new and more formidable species of Kaiju surfaces. Within five years the Jaeger program is all but abandoned. Though a few brave robot-jockeys continue to fight the good fight the program is largely mothballed with the governments of the world instead investing in the construction of a giant ""Wall of Life"" intended to keep out the transgalactic interlopers. (Lets see liberal filmmaker border wall intended to keep out ""aliens""--Ill give you one guess how well this works.)Lets begin with the good Pacific Rims visual effects are extraordinary in particular an early Jaeger-Kaiju battle that takes place off the nighttime coast of Anchorage--an irresistibly kinetic and immersive churn of metal sinew and lizard flesh and sea foam. (Eat your heart out Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla.) The final half-hour or so of the film is similarly spectacular--more Jaegers fighting more Kaijus--even if it doesnt quite reach the heights of that initial confrontation.The problem is pretty much everything that takes place in between. There are a few nice visual moments scattered here and there a gag involving a Newtons cradle; a scene of workers sitting on the girders of the half-constructed Wall that recalls iconic Manhattan skyscraper photos; an introductory shot peeking under an umbrella in the rain thats reminiscent of a similar shot in Hellboy. But overall the plotting is tedious the characters drab and the dialogue evidently contrived with the specific intent of losing nothing in the process of dubbing or subtitling. Indeed almost every element of the film seems designed for a seamless translation to foreign audiences and while in some areas this is not a bad thing (the international cast the Hong Kong setting) for the most part the result is a bland narrative appeal to the lowest common denominator. The movies visual achievements notwithstanding Pacific Rims greatest breakthrough may be that its the first Hollywood blockbuster to sport a title less descriptive of its plot than of its intended market. Charlie Hunnam (of Sons of Anarchy) stars as Generic Caucasian American Hero Jaeger pilot Raleigh Becket--yes I know but be forewarned that the names only get worse from here. In the early going Raleigh is essentially indistinguishable from his brother/co-pilot Yancy (Homelands Diego Klattenhoff) though the film solves this problem by killing the latter off about 10 minutes in. Raleighs stiffly upper-lipped boss in the Jaeger program played by Idris Elba with an uncharacteristic lack of charisma is Stacker Pentecost (I told you); and his eventual new co-pilot and budding love interest is Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi of Babel). Rounding out the cast are Charlie Day and Burn Gorman as a mismatched pair of Kaiju researchers and Ron Perlman as a black marketeer specializing in Kaiju organs.Normally when a film provides characters as underdeveloped as these the solution is to spend a little more time letting us get to know them. But in Pacific Rim the problem is that we already spend far too much time getting to not-know them. Lets face it Were here for the robots and monsters and pretty much every minute--and there are many of them--that del Toro wastes on underfed romance clunking stabs at grace and awkwardly manufactured interpersonal conflict is a minute that were not able to enjoy the Global Ultimate Fighting Championship Behemoth Division. It is worth noting here that a central element of the movies plot is that a single human being cannot withstand the psychic strain of operating a Jaeger alone so two pilots latched into mechanical harnesses side by side within the massive robotic cranium must get into one anothers heads via ""neural bridge"" to operate the machine together. (Duos adept at such bonding are called ""drift compatible"" which seems a phrase better-suited to surfing than to repelling alien invasions.) Its a hokey conceit--though many films have made do with worse--and del Toro does it no favors by larding it with metaphorical meaning. ""Either we get along or we die"" he told The Boston Globe. ""The idea of the movie is just for us to trust each other to cross over barriers of color sex beliefs whatever and just stick together.""Normally when a film provides characters as underdeveloped as these the solution is to spend a little more time letting us get to know them. But in Pacific Rim the problem is that we already spend far too much time getting to not-know them. Its an admirable sentiment I suppose though one not much in evidence in the actual movie. Far from offering a melding of different types the Jaeger teams generally seem an exercise in genetic overlap. Of the four crews we meet one is made up of two brothers another of father and son and a third of two Russians sharing a last name (whether this denotes marriage or siblinghood is unclear); the only team featuring non-nuclear family is the one comprised of Hunnam and Kikuchis characters who are gradually (and unpersuasively) revealed to be proto-smooch-buddies. In the end this all-in-the-family ethos seems like yet another prong in the movies international marketing strategy. We know all the usual panders limit the comedy (which often doesnt translate) go wild with the explosions (which always do) and dont worry too much about the central plot. But Pacific Rim adds a new wrinkle with its constant recourse to familial motivations a brother avenging his brother a daughter avenging her parents a surrogate dad protecting his surrogate daughter an Aussie father-and-son team swapping sacrifices a boy offering his life for the girl he loves and on and on. Forget culture-specific incentives such as honor or glory let alone motivations more complex Here its all about defending the tribe on levels micro and macro alike.As noted Pacific Rim is visually spectacular and those curious should endeavor to see it on the large screen. But the film also serves as a cautionary tale of the compromises entailed in trying to be all things to all peoples.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed.

The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

A whopping 97 percent said they wished they were more conscientious. These desires appeared to be rooted in dissatisfaction. People wanted to become more extraverted if they werent happy with their sex lives hobbies or friendships. They wanted to become more conscientious if they were displeased with their finances or schoolwork. The findings reflect the social psychologist Roy Baumeisters notion of ""crystallization of discontent"" Once people begin to recognize larger patterns of shortcomings in their lives he contends they may reshuffle their core values and priorities to justify improving things.

By David Edelstein Guillermo del Toro directs this giant monsters versus giant robots blockbuster. 143 Shares Share 108 Tweet 31 Share 2 Share Email Print Share Photo Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures/Warner Bros The Mexican-born director Guillermo del Toro evinces so much passion when he talks about genre -- horror fantasy and sci-fi in film and fiction -- that its hard to believe he managed to get so little emotion into his giant-robots-versus-giant-monsters epic Pacific Rim. The movie isnt bad. It has a couple of exciting scenes (I cant really remember them but I remember being excited) and one actor with more preternatural force than the monsters. Its just weirdly inexpressive. Pacific Rim (a flat title though a good setup for the inevitable porn version) doesnt even have the charm of such Toho beanbags as Destroy All Monsters War of the Gargantuas or the underappreciated King Kong EscapesA -- in which Kong battles ""MechaKong"" the creation of the dastardly Dr. Who (not the TARDIS one). Pacific Rim made me marvel at the technology of movies but never the magic of them. I think Del Toro goes wrong from the first line of the voice-over narration when the nominal hero Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) says he was 15 when the first kaiju (translation giant f--king alien f---ing monster) emerged from a portal to another world in the middle of the sea. The story he goes on to tell -- how Earths weapons were ineffectual and cities leveled how scientists were finally able to design giant robots that had to be operated by mind-melded (pardon my Trekspeak) pilots -- sounds as if it would make a fantastic movie. Imagine that first out-of-nowhere kaiju attack the decisive failure of tanks and missiles the frantic arms race as millions perish the tragic mistakes (in which test pilots die horribly) before neuro-connectivity is achieved ... Did I miss that movie? Or did Del Toro for reasons known only to him decide to make the overblown sequel first? Its as if Michael Bay had skipped right to Transformers 2 without establishing his hero and giving us a baseline of normalcy. After the aforementioned Pacific Rim 1 has been hastily synopsized Pacific Rim 2 kicks off with an unprecedentedly deadly Pacific Rim expulsion. Whatever demon power is sending humongous whatzits up that subterranean canal it has adapted to our killing techniques and modified its kaiju. Plus its sending out two at time Who knew it could do that? Could it possibly send three? Surely not. Raleigh and his brother Yancy Becket (Diego Klattenhoff) are ace giant-robot (or jaeger) pilots meaning theyre -- all together now -- jaegermeisters. But after they disobey orders to save a freighter they get reamed. Five years later it looks bad for humankind but better for the movie with an uptick in screen time for boss-man Stacker Pentecost played by Idris Elba. Forget The Wire Luther etc. If anything proves Elba is a major actor its Pacific Rim. He can makes a ridiculously florid exhortation to his troops -- ""At the edge of our hope at the end of our time ... "" -- sound better than what Shakespeare offered Henry at Agincourt. Elba picks up this ten-ton barrel of silliness and carries it like Atlas on his back. In most films scenes in which tight-ass superiors chastise maverick heroes for being mavericky are there to make the maverickness seem even more heroic. Elba makes you want to tell the mavericks to shut up and listen. He psychs Raleigh out and the audience too. Its a tragedy of cosmic proportions that he has no scenes with the movies only other good character a mythically sleazy dealer in dead kaiju body parts called Hannibal Chau played by Ron Perlman. Perhaps their classic confrontation happened in Pacific Rim 1. In any case Elba has little chemistry with the actors he does have scenes with -- Hunnam and the little mangalike Japanese femme Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) whos eager to suit up and boot up and avenge the death of her family. Mori is cute and game and is capable of registering more than one emotion at a time. As her scene partner Hunnam doesnt have a lot to work with. Hes a good actor but hes blandified. Del Toro is one of those directors (Christopher Nolan remains the Lord and Savior) who brings out the fanboys ever eager to defend him (even before seeing the film in question) from the slings and arrows of critics who just dont get it. Perusing the web Ive found comments like this after negative reviews ""You should know what youre signing up for when you buy a ticket to this movie. Its [sic] a monsters vs robots movie. In my eyes that is just a fun entertaining time. You dont have to be an 11 year old boy to appreciate this. Anyone can like a [sic] robots and monsters engaging in a smackdown."" I agree But anyone who can geek out to Pacific Rim is doing a lot of the movies work for it. The compositions are boxy and the battles clanky and spatially incoherent -- shot up close for extra punch but with so little breathing room in the frame that you lose all sense of scale. I almost never knew who (or what) was bashing whom (or what). The film is better when its not so fast and furious as in shots of choppers carrying (and landing) the colossal robots or of creatures emerging from the sea and only gradually revealing their odd shapes and protuberances. Gigantitude prompts awe. The wittiest design is of a kaiju fetus that erupts from its mothers womb -- also the films most organic design. Otherwise Del Toros feel for organic textures doesnt come through in a movie made mostly inside computers. Pacific Rim is a puzzler. Its as if Del Toro neuro-linked with a robot and then couldnt figure out how to work the controls -- and so watched impotently as the machine made the major creative decisions.

Grade C All the unpredictability of professional wrestling plus the magic of synchronized Stairmasters -- thats what I got out of the vaunted spectacle of ""Pacific Rim."" This proudly hollow sci-fi epic features gargantuan alien monsters or ""Kaiju"" fighting giant man-made robots or ""Jaegers"" which are operated from the inside by two or three human pilots mentally joined by a psychic link. (This neural process is called ""drifting."") Like everything else in the movie that sounds more complicated than it is. In action it means that huge slimy creatures go after towering mechanical warriors while inside the robots pilots work ultra-sophisticated exercise machines. Guillermo del Toro one of the dozen most talented directors in films today tries to will his way into a second childhood in ""Pacific Rim."" For this enormous rumpus room of a movie he builds magnificent behemoths and eye-popping erector-set Goliaths only to ram them together and break them apart. The fighting usually unfolds in the dark often in rain mist or brackish deep-sea waters. Its as if the movie is born with a caul A hazy scrim separates the viewer from del Toros legendary detail-work particularly in 3D which makes everything even darker. (The boxy compositions and bombastic editing dont help.) The one piece of combat that did jack up my pulse-rate was a multi-part martial art exhibition put on by ace Jaeger pilot Raleigh Becket - especially when he jousts with Mako Mori the woman who wants to be his copilot. Their fighting is intricate keen and rapt with tension. Best of all you can see it. In the introduction we learn that Kaiju emerged from a gateway to another dimension that opened up between tectonic plates on the Pacific floor. Some characters call this opening ""the bridge."" Just as often its referred to as ""the breach"" - or maybe I heard it that way because half the lines are variations on ""Once more into the breach"" Sadly the script contains no Shakespearean eloquence - the closest del Toro and co-writer Travis Beacham come to a stirring proclamation is ""Today we are cancelling the apocalypse "" which sounds like a threat issued by a studio executive. Jaeger commander Stacker Pentecost (who came up with these names?) has been a Jaeger pilot or officer ever since the best minds on Earth devised the program to head off the Kaiju. Elba is a terrific actor but as Stacker hes reduced to booming out orders. Early on del Toros camera notes Stackers recurrent nosebleed. For anyone over the age of 8 its a dead giveaway to his ultimate fate like the telltale coughs of romantic heroines. Del Toro introduces Becket in an 18-minute prologue He and his older brother Yancy simultaneously try to save a fishing-boat and destroy a Kaiju off the coast of Alaska. Diego Klattenhoff plays Yancy with warmth and dash. (Klattenhoff is one of the acting heroes of Showtimes ""Homeland""; he plays the protagonists sometime best friend.) The colorless one-note Charlie Hunnam (""Nicholas Nickleby"" ""Sons of Anarchy"") plays Raleigh. When Yancy gets killed you may think ""Wrong brother."" The main action picks up five years later when the Kaijus have escalated their assault and Stacker has been ordered to phase out the Jaeger program. The powers-that-be prefer building an anti-Kaiju coastal wall. Have they not seen ""World War Z?"" Intent on mounting his own anti-Kaiju campaign Stacker rounds up the surviving Jaegers and pilots including Becket whos been working construction on the anti-Kaiju wall. Becket and his eventual copilot Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) become part of a four-Jaeger team seeking to nuke the portal and close it up for good. The personal hurdles in the film are trite and tacked-on. Memories of watching a Kaiju kill her family haunt Mori; the trauma threatens her stability when she locks into the neural ""Drift"" with Raleigh. All that gives it some frisson is Kikuchis porcelain beauty and rippling sensitivity. Del Toro has said that ""drifting"" is a metaphor for empathy. But empathy cant exist in the artificial environment of ""Pacific Rim."" Del Toro could become the Federico Fellini of robot-and-monster movies. I dont mean that as a compliment. After a string of masterworks Fellini turned into ""Fellini"" - a brand name. He talked a great game without realizing it onscreen. He assembled unforgettable faces and stranded them in meandering narratives. Thats where del Toro could be headed with ""Pacific Rim."" When del Toro speaks of Elba as ""a Rodin sculpture-type larger than life almost like a Russian realism statue"" the disconnect between that grand description and the monotonous performance is monumental. Del Toro hands every Jaeger and Kaiju myriad distinctive traits and markings but he doesnt mold them into a rattling good story. The one Kaiju thats genuinely disarming is a googly-eyed spawn who pops up for a few deliriously entertaining minutes. This lurching half-baked creature is more amusing than the human comic relief - Charlie Day and Burn Gorman as hyperactive scientists (take some Adderall please) or Ron Pearlman as a hot-shot black-marketer dealing Kaiju organs. ""Pacific Rim"" plays as if del Toro has forgotten everything about human behavior that resonated in the horrors of ""The Devils Backbone"" and ""Pans Labyrinth"" making them contemporary classics. ""Pacific Rim"" might have been directed by a Jaeger nicknamed ""del Toro"" with schlockmeisters Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich at the controls.

"Pacific Rim (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Pacific Rim (PG-13) A monster mash with robots. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com7/11/2013 Editor rating 2.5 Pacific Rim the latest jaw-dropper from director Guillermo del Toro (Pans Labyrinth The Devils Backbone Hellboy) contains some of the wildest giddiest sights of any movie this summer -- building-sized robots fighting enormous creatures from beneath the sea to the death their brawls sometimes demolishing entire cities. This combination of Godzilla-style kaiju (giant monster movies) and mecha animes (cartoons that feature piloted robots) is unlike any youve seen before. It is a kind of wish-fulfillment fantasy for anyone who shares del Toros love of genre and fantasy and make-believe. Its the cinematic equivalent of a kid playing with his toys and smashing action figures together except del Toro does it with more grace and imagination than most. There are long sequences in this movie that merit that most overused of terms ""Awesome."" The film fares less well when its focusing on plain old human beings. Del Toro who co-wrote the script with Travis Beacham relies on hokey cliches to define his characters all by a single trait. Set seven years into our war against the kaijus the film focuses on Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam) a retired pilot who quit after seeing his brother die but is now reluctantly pulled back into duty. Mako (Rinko Kikuchi) is his co-pilot (each robot requires two people to operate) still traumatized by an encounter with the monsters when she was a little girl. Idris Elba is their commanding officer a no-nonsense marshal who refuses to give up on what increasingly looks like a losing battle. Charlie Day plays a neurotic bumbling scientist. And so on. Archetypes can sometimes work well in the context of a giant movie that has so much ground to cover you dont have time to notice how two-dimensional the characters are. But thats not the case with Pacific Rim whose central premise demands that we are emotionally invested in the people inside those iron warriors. Del Toro usually excels at this (he even managed to make you care about the parade of oddball creatures in the Hellboy pictures) and he tries to emphasize the human element in this enormous fantasy by requiring each team of pilots to mind-meld before operating the robots so they share each others emotions and pain. For all his efforts though the characters remain uninteresting stock types -- the daredevil hero his jealous rival the stoic captain the vulnerable heroine. Fortunately Pacific Rim spends more time with its eye-popping battle scenes than it does with people standing around talking. Each new monster looks different and is bigger than the last and del Toro holds on his incredible creations in long shots that allow you to take in the action clearly instead of the incomprehensible whirl and noise of the Transformers movies. As mankinds robot army dwindles and the stakes are raised del Toro makes you wonder how exactly the good guys will win the day. Pacific Rim is by turns goofy and thrilling and dumb and its probably a half-hour too long (after a while the battles become exhausting). But every time youre about to check out of the movie something cool happens that pulls you back in like a robot plucking a freight ship from the ocean and using it like a crowbar to bash his gnarly enemy in the face. As summer popcorn entertainment goes you could do a lot worse.

Related links By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 1041pm on Thursday Jul. 11 2013 Thursday Jul. 11 2013 Friday Jul. 12 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram On its sleek surface Pacific Rim is just another action-movie summer slamdance. Things explode glass shatters buildings fall and heroes before taking on some particularly brave feat of derring-do say ""Lets do this""Certainly if the idea of giant human-controlled robots battling giant alien monsters doesnt strike you as the most amazingly awesome idea ever Pacific Rim isnt going to convince you otherwise. But if that is something that stirs more than passing interest then Pacific Rim delivers the goods in all their cacophonous city-crushing glory.Its the very near future and a rupture in the earth at the bottom of the Pacific opens a portal to another dimension where monsters -- which look like a cross between Godzilla and that thing from Cloverfield -- storm through with their beady eyes set on every metropolis on the coast. (Fans of such British sci-fi shows as Torchwood and Primeval where odd creatures were always wandering through such temporal distortions will no doubt feel right at home.)After having our Pacific cities terrorized one too many times humankind fights back with some monsters of their own called Jaegers -- towering robots controlled by two human pilots. Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba The Wire) is in charge of the program and Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam Sons of Anarchy) is one of his best pilots even though he was traumatized when he lost his brother and co-pilot years earlier going mano-a-mano with a monster.As the attacks become more frequent and ferocious -- hey did one of those things just almost step on the Sydney Opera House? -- the humans realize theyve got to somehow close off that portal once and for all. Is our pilot up for the challenge? Pacific Rim is saved from utter cliche by a few things. Mexican director Guillermo del Toro ( Pans Labyrinth Hellboy) has long wanted to put his vision of Japanese kaiju (monsters) on screen and the look of the film from the clanging retro-futuristic robots to the dark claustrophobia of the urban panorama bear his personal stamp. Mans saviors arent cute wise-cracking Transformers but brutal killing machines and theres none of the sense of camp that might be expected in an update on the Asian monster movie.Then there are the performances especially that of Elba who takes the standard-issue no-nonsense military commander role and infuses it with a sense of depth and gravity. Japanese actress Rinko Kikuchi ( The Brothers Bloom) as a trainee pilot also adds layers to what could have been a predictable part.Charlie Day (Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia) and Burn Gorman ( Torchwood) as dorky scientists and Ron Perlman as a gangster dealing in black-market monster body parts are meant as comic relief. While this element doesnt always work it does give the script (from Del Toro and Travis Beacham Clash of the Titans) some levity.Most of all there are the bot-vs.-beast battles. Lots of them. Maybe too many. And no one bothers to ask this question If the military engagements with the monsters destroy the city theyre trying to protect whats the point? (In other words anyone living in Hong Kong might want to get out now.)No matter. The fights are well-staged and theres just enough interstitial humanity among boxing matches to keep things from getting monotonous.As many others have already said this season ""Lets do this"" Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jul. 11 2013 1053AM EDT Last updated Thursday Jul. 11 2013 302PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Guillermo del Toro Written by Travis Beacham and Giullermo del Toro Starring Charlie Hunnam Idris Elba and Rinko Kikuchi Classification PG Year 2013 Country USA Language English Of all this years loud over-long summer action movies that in various ways simulate the experience of having a tin bucket placed over your head and being struck repeatedly with a stick it must be said that Guillermo del Toros Pacific Rim is by far the most entertaining. The reasons are large and obvious Monster vs. Robots with lots of complications and beautiful images thrown in between bathtub fights. An extended pre-credit sequence packs all the exposition into one huge dollop with the first fight scene thrown in as an appetizer. In the near-future a dragon-like monster emerges from the ocean and stomps much of San Francisco into rubble before the military repels it. When more monsters named Kaiju after old Japanese monster movies keep popping up and attacking more cities the worlds scientific community perhaps with help from Mattel comes together to counter-attack with the most entertaining weapons they can find Skyscraper-sized rockem sockem robots called Jaegers (the German word for hunter) that require the tandem operation of human co-pilots who are locked in a telepathic ""neural handshake"" known as The Drift.All this information is served up in fluttering montages with a voice-over from jaunty chisel-abbed Kaiju fighter Raleigh Beckett (Charlie Hunnam). We also witness our first skirmish when Raleigh along with his older brother Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff) engages a Kaiju off the coast of Alaska which offers a quick immersion into the nature of ultimate inter-species battle Splashing gnashing spewing grappling and lots of ""gwahr"" sounds set to a thunderous musical score. Meanwhile the two pilots locked in the robots chest share flashback memories together and wave their arms in what appears to be a vigorous game of Wii doubles tennis.A few years later and the self-important dummies who rule the world have changed their minds. Jaeger fighters arent winning the war. The new politically correct solution is to build a giant protective wall around the Pacific coast while foolishly mothballing the Jaeger program. ""Something there is that doesnt love a wall"" wrote the poet Robert Frost. Now we have the answer Kaiju The big beasties stomp right over the one around Australias Sydney Opera House the only time Del Toro indulges in the kind of monument Whac-A-Mole game that Roland Emmerich (Independence Day) so delights in.So now its almost the end of the world. The last remnants of the Jaeger program are down to four robots holed up in a giant airplane hangar in Hong Kong named Shatterdome. The joint has been lovingly designed in a kicky mixture of crumbling medieval antique army surplus dun and early muffler shop. The commander with the name of Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba The Wire) is a large immaculately-dressed British man of African descent who looks and sounds like someone you would want in charge when monsters attack. When Stacker bellows the films signature line - ""Today we are cancelling the Apocalypse"" he sounds like he has the authority to make that call.You may find the robot-vs-monster battles too frantic and dark and three-dimensionally confusing to know who is doing what to whom but somehow it works Usually shot at night against the backdrop of glowing city harbours they involve a lot of violent beautiful thrashing. What distinguishes Pacific Rim from the rest of the summer fare is that is del Toro (Pans Labrynth Hellboy) a visual artist creates living fantasy paintings more than just engineering slow-motion explosions. The design throughout is constantly imaginative and even at two and a half hours it moves like a fast drum roll punctuated with ""a-has"" of familiar moments.Thats because Del Toro and co-screenwriter Travis Beacham have synthesized innumerable ideas from other creature features and sci-fi plots paying homage to Japanese studio Toho Co. Ltd. that gave us Godzilla and other post-war monster metaphors of nuclear terrors but also including nods to Aliens Terminator Transformers and probably the Japanese nineties anime series Neon Genesis Evangeline. Sometimes the mish-mash is too generic Because the monsters are are supposedly evolving with each encounter they lack personality and have a rent-a-beast quality variously resembling squid sharks angler fish pteradactyls and a wet Cookie Monster.In any case the beasts are really just a quasi-Biblical reminder that human beings need to learn how to work together better. Under Pentecosts command are a couple of squabbling nerd scientists including Charlie Day (Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia) as Dr. Newton Geizler a scratchy voiced Gabby Hayes-type who wants to form a neural-bridge with a Kaiju. Burn Gorman plays his twitchy British partner the statistics-loving Strangelovian Dr. Hermann Gottlieb. Further pulpy weirdness includes Ron Perlman as Dr. Hannibal Chau a pimped-out dealer of Kaiju body parts in a Bladerunner underground world.The cast is refreshingly international in keeping with the movies endorsement of co-operation among those of us of the human species. The co-pilot teams include a Australian father and son (Max Martini and Rob Kazinsky) Russian and Chinese couples and even cross-cultural soul-mate strangers. At the centre of the human story is the relationship between Becket and a Japanese woman Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi Babel) a ward of Stacker Pentecosts. They meet when she is working as a combat analyst but after their first martial arts contest (oh why not?) they recognize a meeting of the punches as a meeting of the minds. It helps that both are suffering from post-traumatic Kaiju-induced stress syndrome so when they mind-meld its like a double visit to a psychotherapists couch.That leads to in the midst of a big noisy kids game of a movie what may be the most tender image of any movie this year when Raleigh and Mako as a male-female American-Japanese monster fighting team sit on a life raft in the Pacific Ocean and press their foreheads together in a moment of exhausted relief. They look like parents who have finally put a fretful toddler to bed. After a long cycle of action movies in which the protagonists spend most of their downtime introspecting about their heroic obligations Pacific Rim is something different a heart-warming team-building exercise.

Credit Warner Brothers The simple pleasures of watching Godzilla or Ultraman doing battle on Saturday afternoon television have proved difficult to re-create since their heyday in the 70s and 80s. Big-budget Hollywood attempts to replicate the experience tend to not just be failures but disastrous highly polished failures on an epic scale Roland Emmerichs 1998 take on Godzilla for instance or Michael Bays Transformers series. But director Guillermo del Toro knows that the charm in the clash of scale- or armor-plated titans isnt necessarily tied to the low budgets and laughable production design of those guilty-pleasure TV shows. And with Pacific Rim he cracks the code. It was probably only a matter of time before del Toro tackled this genre; his career on the one hand has been largely devoted to monsters of one kind or another and their place as stand-ins for the things that scare us in the real world. Japanese movie monsters on the other were little more than atomic-age fears of mass destruction made flesh -- made rubber suits anyway. In this modern-day update of the genre those monsters launched del Toro and writer Travis Beacham trade in nuclear anxiety for more top-of-mind worries about climate change. The monstrous creatures rising from the deep in Pacific Rim are even assigned categories according to their size and power mirroring those we give nowadays to hurricanes; a Category 4 beast can easily take out a major city and a rarely seen Category 5 is a destructive force of nearly unimaginable proportions. A speedy prologue wastes no time setting things up which (thankfully) allows the movie to avoid the 2.5-hour-plus running times currently plaguing event movies at the multiplex. The Kaiju -- this near-future society is pop-culture-savvy enough to have used Japanese movie-monster nomenclature for the creatures -- come from an interdimensional portal on the ocean floor known as The Breach. And like rising sea levels theyve been taking out coastal cities. As the periodic appearances of these creatures have shown no signs of abating humanity has banded together to create ""Jaegers"" -- 25-story battlebots operated by dual pilots who must temporarily merge minds to drive the things. Del Toro quite rightly declines to take any of this nearly as seriously as the characters in the movie do. For them the war with the Kaiju which is in its seventh year as the movie begins isnt just life or death; its life or worldwide apocalypse. But del Toro is making entertainment and even though his battles rage at night amid gloomy seas the movie doesnt share the grim humorless tone of the summers other would-be blockbusters. So while Jaeger pilot Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam) may be the dashing hero his partner Mako (Rinko Kikuchi) the emotional core and Jaeger Corps head honcho Stacker (Idris Elba) the authoritative father figure its Charlie Day as Kaiju biologist Newton Geiszler who best exemplifies what makes Pacific Rim work so well. Geizlers scenes are funny -- especially once he hooks up with the closest thing the movie has to a human villain played by an actor whose big-reveal scene is too good to even mention him by name here. But theyre not just comic relief; without Geiszler and his talents the full plan of the resistance cant come to fruition. In making him so central del Toro weaves together the films light and dark aspects so that the proceedings cant be dominated by either. He also keeps things limber with a steady stream of well-integrated cultural references. Early on one pilot quotes Han Solo to another; one of the first shots of Hong Kong where much of the movies pivotal battles take place suggests the look and feel of Blade Runner; Stackers speech before the climactic showdown evokes the St. Crispins Day monologue from Henry V. (He never says ""Once more unto the breach"" from that plays other big soliloquy but given how many times the film refers to The Breach elsewhere he hardly needs to.) As youd expect in a del Toro film the production design -- particularly that of the monsters -- is gorgeously detailed. Its a shame then that the only tired modern action trope the director falls victim to is the one that sometimes takes him too close to the action in battle sequences making them a little confusing and blunting the impact of some of that design work. Quibbles aside Pacific Rim delivers plenty of the thing thats been lacking in this summers event movies fun. Monsters robots grand heroism and a few clever jokes Sounds like a perfect Saturday afternoon to me.

"Guillermo Del Toros Pacific Rim reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Guillermo Del Toros Pacific Rim Makes Monster-Walloping Fun Again Guillermo Del Toros Pacific Rim Makes Monster-Walloping Fun Again Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 11 2013 627 PM Pacific Rim Monster-walloping made fun again. By Dana Stevens Rinko Kikuchi in the monsters vs. robots saga Pacific Rim. Courtesy of Warner Bros. After youve seen Pacific Rim come back and listen to our Spoiler Special Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Im not sure how to justify my sense that Guillermo Del Toros Pacific Rim is a cut above your average summer blockbuster in which monsters and giant robots cause major damage to iconic city skylines against a post-apocalyptic landscape. This 132-minute movie certainly has its share of long hard-to-follow battle sequences thinly developed human characters and grating comic relief. Yet somehow coming out of Pacific Rim I felt energized rather than enervated excited to describe certain nifty details of the films wacked-out imaginary world to friends maybe even ready to ... sit through certain parts again? Pacific Rim is unashamedly a film for little kids--at times it feels almost like a very well-made ""look at my toys"" YouTube video by a little kid albeit one with a staggering collection of action figures. But where the Transformers franchise has the soul-deadening effect of an extended toy infomercial Pacific Rim offers at least some sense of watching an imagination at play. Its based on an original story by Del Toros co-screenwriter Travis Beacham--original not just in the sense that it isnt based on any pre-existing movie comic book TV show or line of toys but in the sense that its sort of weird. In this movies near future the Earth has been attacked by creatures known as the Kaiju (the word in Japanese means ""strange beast"" and is also the name of the genre of giant-monster movies launched by 1954s Godzilla). The Kaiju--whose rapid evolution means that they can easily appear either as serpentine sea monsters dinosaur-like land reptiles or insectoid flying horrors--came from deep within the Earths core but also somehow through a portal to another universe located in an underwater passage called ""the Breach."" Humanitys only defense against these invaders (other than a short-lived experiment at a peaceable ""Wall of Life"" which the monsters tear through like so much cookie dough) are gigantic fighting robots called Jaegers (German for ""hunters""). Because of their enormous size--were talking 25-plus stories high--Jaegers can only be operated by pairs of specially trained pilots each in command of one-half the robots body their brains locked into a state of intimate connectedness known as ""neural drift."" All this terminology is swiftly laid out in a kind of pre-credits tutorial in which we also learn that the voiceover provider (and nominal if cypher-like main character) is Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) a once-cocky Jaeger pilot whos lost his beloved brother and co-pilot to the monsters as a result of disobeying a direct order. Thats not a wise thing to do when your commander is a legendary ex-Jaeger pilot with the glorious name of Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba). Crushed by his brothers death Becket leaves piloting behind and takes a job at the ill-fated Wall of Life but hes coaxed back into the cockpit--or rather the enormous robot torso--by Pentecost whose embattled Jaeger fleet is making a last stand before its phased out by the UN (which in a decade or two will apparently unilaterally arbitrate all worldwide disputes--congrats in advance to whoever turns that organization around). To achieve the state of ""neural drift"" with a co-pilot requires not only a familial sense of closeness--the teams we meet include an Australian father and son a Russian brother and sister and a set of Chinese triplets--but an ability to share memories and sense impressions. These inward journeys are also witnessed by the audience in the form of trippy neural-pathway-cam montages that sometimes morph into legitimate flashbacks. I loved Del Toros confident shifts in between psychedelic vaguely touchy-feely Matrix territory (""Dont chase the rabbit Stay in the drift. The drift is silence."") and introspection-free monster-on-robot action though I might have wished for a little more world-building in place of the world-destruction. The sheer scale and design of the creatures remains thrilling even when for those not versed in the kaiju and mecha cultures that inspired the beast and bot designers their sessions of whaling on each other get a little confusing and redundant. At least Del Toro mixes up the look and staging of the fight scenes--one in midair the next (spectacularly) underwater the next a semicomic encounter with a hungry baby Kaiju just burst from the womb--so that we never know what to expect next from these rapidly mutating world-marauders. The human stories that take place in the interstices between Kaiju/Jaeger battles and neural-drift freak-outs are the Achilles heel in Pacific Rims ingeniously designed armor. Idris Elba is effortlessly charismatic (not to mention knee-meltingly handsome) as the authoritative Pentecost and he gets off one good laugh line when a subordinate dares to invade his well-policed personal space. But Pentecosts longstanding paternal relationship with the young female pilot Mako Mori (Babels Rinko Kikuchi) is sketched far too hastily to resonate with the audience as is Moris partnership-turned-romance with Hunnams Becket. Becket has to be one of the most unprepossessing male leads in an action movie since Ryan Reynolds in The Green Lantern. Not that its entirely Hunnams fault given that his character description can be reduced to ""blandly attractive guy whos sad because his brother died."" I didnt mind Pacific Rims sometimes hokey dialogue like the once-more-unto-the-breach oration in which Pentecost inspires his Jaeger team with the promise that ""Today we are canceling the Apocalypse""--it all seemed like part of the movies genial Saturday-afternoon-matinee vibe. But I wish those cheesy lines had been spoken by characters Id had at least one more scene to get to know. Opinions will be divided on the comic-relief segments featuring Charlie Day and Burn Gorman as two bumbling scientists with conflicting theories as to how to approach the study of Kaiju. Days character whose obsession with procuring an intact Kaiju brain eventually gets him mixed up with black-market organ dealer Hannibal Chau (Ron Perlman) has a high-pitched voice and manic demeanor that frayed at my nerves but I suspect the characters broad humor and insatiable curiosity will appeal to young viewers--its a role Rick Moranis could have played back in the day. (Come back to the movies soon Rick.) Perlman a constant in Del Toros filmography long before his stint in the Hellboy movies gets little to do with his enormous screen presence other than snarl at underlings while wearing steampunk goggles and gold-plated shoes (I wanted an extended Perlman-led tour of the Kaiju-organ-harvesting underworld with all the rad props that would no doubt entail). Perlman does appear in a goofy mid-credits stinger that refreshingly drops nary a portentous hint at a sequel. But Pacific Rims ability to make monster-walloping feel fun again will no doubt make Atlantic Seaboard (or maybe Mediterranean Coastal Region) as inevitable a follow-up as the return of the Kaiju through that pesky underwater portal.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Crimson Typhoon is one of the giant Jaegers fighting robots built to battle the Kaiju sea creatures in ""Pacific Rim."" (Warner Bros. Pictures) By Ann Hornaday July 11 2013 Follow AnnHornaday ""Pacific Rim"" is a big lumbering rock em sock em mash-up of metallic heft and hyperbole a noisy overproduced disaster flick that sucks its characters and the audience down a vortex of garish visual effects and risibly cartoonish action. And you know what? Its not bad Leave it to Guillermo del Toro -- that overgrown fanboy with a heart of gold and a mind of impressive philosophical complexity -- to bring some sense and sensibility to this summers crop of dumb spectacles. ""Pacific Rim"" will never qualify as part of the directors high-end oeuvre -- ""Pans Labyrinth"" it most decidedly aint. But as an example of del Toros abiding love for comic books pop culture and movie genre excess it ranks with his less intellectual but equally imaginative efforts maybe somewhere between ""Blade II"" and the gloriously bodacious ""Hellboy."" In fact ""Hellboys"" mordant star Ron Perlman shows up for a cameo in ""Pacific Rim"" not sheathed in red leathery skin but his own as a black marketeer working Hong Kongs neon-noir byways. Its in that port city sometime in the future that an apocalyptic invasion of sea creatures called Kaiju will or wont be repelled by a ragtag army of Jaegers 25-story robots that look like super-size versions of Robert Downey Jr.s Iron Man right down to the whirring mechanical hearts that glow in their tungsten-clad chests. ""Iron Man"" isnt the only movie ""Pacific Rim"" conjures in the course of its overlong running time. The central standoff between fantastical creatures bears echoes of ""Mothra vs. Godzilla"" as well as the anime classics that del Toro has cited as inspirations. The visual design recalls ""TRON"" some plot elements recall ""Inception"" the crunching action recalls ""Transformers"" and the relationships recall ""Top Gun"" wherein a group of cocky flyboys try to one-up each other in the name of saving the world. At least thats the initial vibe of ""Pacific Rim"" which begins as brothers Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff) and Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam) suit up to inhabit their Jaeger which is powered by two people who meld minds in order to create a unified consciousness the better to smoothly manipulate their giant armored sheath and dispatch the voracious Kaiju. But what begins as just another boys-and-their-toys smash-and-gab turns into something more as del Toro expands the Jaeger universe into something far more balanced even nuanced. The fantastic English actor Idris Elba gives ""Pacific Rim"" sex appeal and gravitas as the Jaegers commander Stacker Pentecost a titanic force and physical specimen himself. When Raleigh meets an ambitious beautiful Jaeger pilot trainee named Mako (Rinko Kikuchi) ""Pacific Rim"" promises to introduce some welcome gender balance to the world of end-of-the-world heroics. And del Toro ever mindful of the exigencies of the genre never succumbs to the humorlessness and over-plotting that has dragged down so many of his contemporaries this season He keeps ""Pacific Rim"" firmly focused on its utterly absurd raison detre (Kill those Kaiju once and for all Youre welcome Hong Kong). But he makes sure to leaven that mission with moments of humor most often at the hands of two goofy Jaeger research scientists played by the charmingly hapless Charlie Day and Burn Gorman who proves the rare performer capable of channeling Jerry Lewis and Roddy McDowall simultaneously. ""Pacific Rim"" isnt nearly as visually rich as del Toros finest efforts The ultimate showdown between the opposing behemoth forces is a murky soup of pulsating blue lights and writhing steel (as always 3-D adds nothing to this enterprise) punctuated by dialogue clearly written in the belief that shouting something loudly enough makes it less ridiculous. But ""Pacific Rim"" earns points for some terrific performances (Elbas chief among them) maintaining consistently engaging momentum and for making the radical -- if subtle -- suggestion that empathy can be a bona fide superpower. That humanistic touch is pure del Toro and it makes all the difference in ""Pacific Rim"" whose own whirring glowing heart doesnt belong to any machine but to the director himself. 1/2 PG-13. At area theaters. Contains sequences of intense sci-fi action and violence throughout and for some profanity. 131 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Jordan and Ariana Neal The Weinstein Company By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated July 11 2013 710 p.m. ET Ryan Cooglers magnificent ""Fruitvale Station"" opens with a shaky cellphone video of a now-infamous event--the fatal shooting of Oscar Grant a black unarmed 22-year-old by a white transit cop at a BART station in Oakland Calif. in the early morning hours of New Years Day 2009. In other hands the video might have been the starting point of a documentary about the victim the disputed facts of the event and the community outrage that the shooting provoked. But Mr. Coogler chose another approach a dramatized account of the day in Oscars life that preceded his death and the film celebrates that life in all its beauty contradiction and thwarted promise. Watch a clip from the film ""Fruitvale Station"" the true story of Oscar a 22-year-old Bay Area resident who crosses paths with friends enemies family and strangers on the last day of 2008. (Photo/Video The Weinstein Company) ""Fruitvale Station"" is a directorial debut of limitless promise; as a first feature its almost miraculous. At the age of 27 Mr. Coogler seems to have it all and have it firmly in place--a clearsighted take on his subject (no airbrushing of flaws or foibles here just confident brush strokes by a mature artist); a spare spontaneous style that can go beyond naturalism into a state of poetic grace and a gift for getting or allowing superb actors to give flawless performances. Oscar Grant is played by Michael B. Jordan who gives a performance that can break your heart or fill it with joy sometimes simultaneously. Oscar is not a model citizen. Hes casually unfaithful dangerously impulsive and adrift in vague dreams of getting his act together. But hes a charmer and a lover. He loves the erratic often anxiety-charged life hes living even though hed prefer less anxiety and more stability. He loves his sorely tried mother Wanda (an exquisite performance by Octavia Spencer) his girlfriend Sophina ( Melonie Diaz) and most of all their young daughter Tatiana ( Ariana Neal) who can lift up his soul with an impish smile. Its a measure of our involvement in this mans fate that when he confesses to having done stupid things and Sophina says angrily ""I could slap you"" we hope against hope that she takes him in her arms instead. All too seldom in todays movie business can a filmmaker be accused of wisdom but Mr. Coogler has done something here that needs to be celebrated in its own turn. Like his subject hes a black man and lives in the Bay Area where Oscar lived. It would have been perfectly logical if hed gone the documentary route if only to highlight the appalling circumstances of Oscars death. (The cop who shot him claimed hed mistakenly used a gun instead of a Taser and received a two-year prison sentence for involuntary manslaughter.) We live after all in a golden age of documentaries when low-cost digital equipment allows filmmakers to explore a vast range of complex subjects. But its a tarnished age for independently produced dramatic films that explore the essence and texture of American life and ""Fruitvale Station"" fills that bill with dazzling distinction. Instead of advancing arguments it captures the mercurial flashes the protean shape of daily experience. (I do wish Mr. Coogler hadnt portrayed the lethal cop as such a brute but his reasons for doing so are hardly mysterious.) Instead of employing a straight-line narrative to make points it pauses for moments of unstressed sweetness silliness or shock Oscars happy participation in a crab-cracking ritual for the family gumbo; his genial encounter with a pretty white shopper ( Ahna OReilly) whos at sea over what fish to buy; the toothbrushing ritual that he shares with Tatiana; the exuberant partying that turns deadly on a BART train filled with New Years Eve revelers; the anticipatory terror of Wanda and Sophina when a doctor emerges from surgery. And through it all Mr. Coogler uses on-screen displays of the texts and phone calls that punctuate Oscars moment-to-moment life; theyre an analog of the impulsivity that plays a role in his death. Its tempting to think that ""Fruitvale Station"" simply erupted from the spirit and skill of a singular filmmaker. Though Mr. Coogler is certainly that the story of this features evolution is more complicated and instructive; it takes a filmmaking village to raise a production to the lofty level of this one. The script was developed at the Sundance Institute and the film was produced by Forest Whitakers production company. Giving additional credit where its deserved the cinematographer was Rachel Morrison the editors were Claudia Castello and Michael P. Shawver Ludwig Goransson wrote the original music and Hannah Beachler designed the production; the costumes were designed by the eminent veteran Aggie Guerard Rodgers. (Another hat tip to BART officials who were wise enough to allow filming on their premises.) At a time when the multiplexes are crowded with coarse comedy and inept spectacle heres a homegrown movie that honors its subject and the medium. The Hunt Watch a clip from the film ""The Hunt."" A lonely teachers life is starting to look up but his new-found luck is about to be brutally shattered when he is accused of sexual assault on his best friends young daughter. (Photo/Video Magnolia Pictures) The power of Thomas Vinterbergs ""The Hunt"" flows in part from its inevitability and paradoxically its familiarity. A little girls random remark raises troubling questions about Lucas a blameless kindergarten teacher and the residents of a pleasant Danish town leap to the conclusion that hes a serial child-molester. In other words its a witch hunt one that replays some of the classic elements of ""The Crucible"" (or transplants to Denmark the real-life events of the McMartin preschool trial that gripped Los Angeles a quarter-century ago.) The all-too-familiar spread of hysteria retains its fascination because those infected by it are as always ignorant of the drama theyre re-enacting; because the setting in this case is an area of the world where hysteria comes in muted tones; and most of all because Lucas is played by the great Mads Mikkelsen (""After the Wedding"" ""Casino Royale"" ""A Royal Affair"") putting his intelligence and formidable intensity in the service of an already wounded passive hero who may not be able to rise to his own defense. ENLARGE Lasse Fogelstrom and Mads Mikkelsen Magnolia Pictures This is filmmaking of a high order even though the productions scale is modest and the climax is not without its facile contrivances. ( Tobias Lindholm whose brilliant ""A Hijacking"" opened last month wrote the script with Mr. Vinterberg. Charlotte Bruus Christensen did the quietly elegant cinematography.) Well before the child Klara ( Annika Wedderkop) utters the fateful words that will shatter Lucass life we see the tender friendship that binds them. On her side Klara is fearful and obsessive yet happy to have the teacher as a refuge from the turmoil that besets her at home. For Lucas living a solitary life after a nasty divorce the child is a cherished surrogate for his own son whos been living with his mother. Watching the nuanced performance at the center of the film you may experience another paradox wanting the character to be as strong as you may know the actor to be. Why doesnt Lucas get a lawyer? Why is he so slow to recognize the dangerous situation hes in? Some of that can be explained by postdivorce depression; at the age of 42 hes working in a kindergarten and just beginning to put his life back together. But the screenplay skillfully deprives him of crucial information--that Klaras words have sent local authorities rushing into the dismal swamp of so-called recovered memories where they encourage other children to invent sexual encounters with Lucas that had no more basis in fact than Klaras fabrication. Theres another literal hunt in ""The Hunt"" an annual ritual in which the towns boys supposedly become men by going out and shooting deer. The deer never know what happened to them either. --J.M. Pacific Rim Watch a clip from the film ""Pacific Rim."" As a war against monstrous sea creatures wages on a former pilot and a trainee are paired up to drive a seemingly obsolete special weapon to save the world from the apocalypse. (Photo/Video Warner Bros.) ""Could be worse"" isnt exactly a ringing endorsement of ""Pacific Rim"" but my head is still ringing and hurting from long stretches of this aliens vs. robots extravaganza that are no better than the worst brain-pounders of the genre. The director and co-writer with Travis Beacham was Guillermo del Toro not Michael Bay. Unlike Mr. Bay the untrammeled technologist of the ""Transformers"" franchise Mr. del Toro is an imagist a fantasist and at his best a cinema poet of highly charged horror. He gets to do some impressive stuff in ""Pacific Rim"" in 3-D IMAX but its a megabudget enterprise that wants desperately to compete in the Michael Bay mode. All too often in that respect the film succeeds i.e. fails. Whats more the good stuff succeeds elegantly and the bad stuff falls dismally flat for reasons that are painfully obvious--painfully because the budget and the commercial ambitions attached to it have prevented the filmmaker from working comfortably in his own mode. ENLARGE Idris Elba Warner Bros. Pictures The towering robots called Jaegers are more intriguing than the gigantic aliens known as Kaiju whove emerged to terrorize our planet from a fissure in the floor of the Pacific Ocean. Where the Kaiju are just your standard-issue monsters with redundant dentition and innards seemingly lighted by blue LEDs the Jaegers have more or less human shapes and their running punching shooting or stabbing is controlled by the balletic movements of two-pilot crews inside them. One of those crews provides the human center of a film that comes up short in humanity--a washed-up pilot Raleigh Becket who just possibly will redeem himself (hes played by Charlie Hunnam) and a beautiful mysterious rookie Mako Mori ( Rinko Kikuchi the Japanese deaf-mute teen in ""Babel""). Idris Elba is impressive as always as Stacker Pentacost a last-ditch military commander while Charlie Day and Burn Gorman as not-so-mad scientists provide a kind of ""Back to the Future"" comedy that seeks to inoculate the production against rampant Bayism. Raleigh and Mako have an exceedingly intimate relationship; they synchronize their brains before each mission to share the neural load of guiding their machines. And the noncombat sequences are set in gorgeously retro bronze-hued environments--think the leather wax and tubing of Terry Gilliams ""Brazil""--where a sense of immense scale is validated by human presence. (And by the immense clanking of machines gates and doors.) Yet the battle scenes seem to be populated by digital versions of Ray Harryhausen puppets and since theres no humanity to measure them against. My neural load wasnt a match for these tedious combatants though earplugs reduced the aural assault. --J.M. DVD Focus Killer of Sheep (1979) ENLARGE Killer of Sheep Charles Burnett was a UCLA graduate student in the 1970s when he shot his remarkable debut feature in 16mm black-and-white as a thesis film. Declared a national treasure by the Library of Congress the movie was rarely shown in public because of poor print quality and problems with music rights. Eventually Milestone Film amp; Video made it possible for movie lovers to see this meticulously restored delicately poetic and essentially plotless vision of life in the Los Angeles area of Watts where a decade after the riots little had changed but the ghettos name recognition. Atonement (2007) ENLARGE Atonement A girls misunderstanding of adult behavior sets the plot in motion changing the course of three lives. Keira Knightley and James McAvoy are the star-crossed lovers of Joe Wrights film adapted by Christopher Hampton from the Ian McEwan novel. Ms. Knightleys Cecilia is quick-tongued and beautifully pensive. Mr. McAvoys Robbie combines working-class buoyancy with understated intellectuality. Saoirse Ronan is Cecilias young sister Briony who jumps to a conclusion that isnt just wrong but perverse. In the last part of her life Briony is played as a spectral presence by Vanessa Redgrave. The Devils Backbone (2006) ENLARGE The Devils Backbone Guillermo del Toro is best known for ""Pans Labyrinth"" (2006) a dark and unforgettable fantasy set in Spain during the Civil War that won three Oscars--for art direction cinematography and makeup. At least as extraordinary and perhaps superior as an allegory of that war is his horror film ""The Devils Backbone."" The time is the late 1930s and the setting is a Spanish orphanage a place of shelter and learning thats haunted by more than standard spooks. The orphanage and its school are emblematic of civilized Spain menaced from within by fascist violence. --J.M. 2 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Donald Trump Lashes Out at Michael Bloomberg GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Bad eco-karma - rising CO2 depleting ozone layer too many Victorias Secret catalogs - has essentially turned the planet into an environmental nightmare making it less hospitable to humankind but just about right for a gang of alien puppetmasters who have unleashed a horde of mega beasts from a portal beneath the sea. Slideshow A titanic beasts-vs.-bots battle over Earth Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Pacific Rim >> Once these humongous super demons fiery-eyed and skyscraper-high wipe out civilization - and by 2020 theyve made considerable progress flattening whole metropolises and killing millions - Earth is up for grabs. The worlds last best hope are the Jaegers gigantic robots each controlled by a pair of pilots who must work in mind-melding tandem. Dropped down in the path of the marauding Kaiju (Japanese sci-fi-inspired shark-headed behemoths angry mega-crustaceans towering flame-throwing insectoids) the Jaegers whomp and pummel wielding shipping containers and plasma cannons. And so for at least half of Pacific Rim thats what you get carnage and conflagration on an epic scale as the dinosaurian creatures from the deep do battle with the man-made leviathans. Its a nuclear-powered mixed-martial-arts match and pretty soon you lose count of how many rounds theyve gone. But unlike say Michael Bay or Roland Emmerich - fellow directors who have similarly laid waste to vast swaths of the universe - del Toro isnt just here to show off his high-tech toys whooshing action shots and awe-inducing visual effects. Pacific Rim shares much with the Mexican filmmakers Hellboy franchise - jokey and comic book-y full of muscular tableaus with huge squads of people coming and going (and running for their lives). In its fantastical realization of the monsters - monsters that certainly owe much more than just their name to the Kaiju movies of Godzilla and Mothra Rodan and Gorgo - Pacific Rim also brings to mind the creepy nightmare beings of del Toros Pans Labyrinth. This time though theyre a lot bigger. Like many of del Toros movies this one boasts Ron Perlman in a prominent role. He is Hannibal Chau (the monikers provenance is good for a one-liner) a shifty entrepreneur who trades in black-market body parts. Kaiju body parts. But it is Perlmans Sons of Anarchy costar Charlie Hunnam who has the lead in Pacific Rim The British actor is Raleigh Becket an ace Jaeger pilot grappling with the loss of his brother in battle. Raleigh goes off to Alaska to do construction work and mope. But he is brought back by Stacker Pentecost (a terse terrific Idris Elba) the marshal who heads the Jaeger program and who needs his best pilot back in the bot business. Enter Mako Mori - Rinko Kikuchi the Oscar-nominated Japanese actress (for Babel). She has blue highlights in her hair and a blue look in her eye. She works closely with Stacker - and shares a history with the commander that is revealed in a striking series of flashbacks (evoking the World War II wastelands of Hiroshima and Nagasaki). Mako and Raleigh turn out to be ""drift compatible"" - that is perfect partners to meld their memories and become one in the Jaegers elaborate VR gamelike cockpit. But for reasons that take a while (and a pair of little red shoes) to explain Stacker resists teaming Mako and Raleigh. But then of course they are teamed. Elba gives his rousing battle speech (yes ""today we are canceling the apocalypse"") and off the mighty Jaegers and their pilots go for one final earthquaking showdown. Pacific Rim looks great. Its one of the rare 3-D features that probably delivers more in the large-screen stereoscopic format - severed Kaiju limbs comin at ya Hunnam and Kikuchi work well together even though most of what theyre required to do is stand side by side suited-up and helmeted their bodies attached to control gizmos moving in sync like dancers - or like somebody on a treadmill at a gym working with their mirror image. But then the ""category 5"" Kaiju rears its giganto head. And so once more unto the breach. Pacific Rim  (Out of four stars) Directed by Guillermo del Toro.

Photo Kerry Hayes Warner Bros. Pacific Rim review Humans dont deserve to win 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Pacific Rim Action. Starring Charlie Hunnam Rinko Kikuchi and Idris Elba. Directed by Guillermo del Toro. (PG-13. 131 minutes.) ""Pacific Rim"" an action movie about the possible destruction of the human race inadvertently makes the case that extinction might not be so bad after all. If this is the best we can do in terms of movies - if something like this can speak to the soul of audiences - maybe we should just turn over the cameras and the equipment to the alien dinosaurs and see what they come up with. Fully half of ""Pacific Rim"" consists of computer renderings of Rock em Sock em Robots (or something close) fighting with computerized images of monster dinosaurs. These images - shown in rapid-fire cuts so you almost have no time to notice theyre mundane - are accompanied by a soundtrack of nonstop noise Blaring brass instruments sounds of waves crashing a soaring chorus (""Ahh Ohh Ahh"") and the deafening clang of grinding machinery. In between the combat scenes we get the gentler interludes in which forthright but stupid people get into pointless emotional conflicts for the sake of creating some illusion of human spectacle. If we do end up rooting for them over the invaders its because biologically we happen to be on their team. But next to these guys the alien dinosaurs keep looking better and better. The movie is set about 10 years from now near the end of a brutal war between humanity and the dinosaurs. Through a fissure in the ocean floor they apparently broke through and started stomping on everything. Within the movies first 30 seconds theyve demolished the Golden Gate Bridge - they would have knocked down the new Bay Bridge but why do something easy? Every week our movies play at the destruction of beloved landmarks to the point where we have to wonder if this is our culture unconsciously rehearsing for something. To combat the monsters the humans devise enormous skyscraper-size iron men controlled by two pilots and these iron men stand in the ocean and try to beat up the dinosaurs. At first these metal giants are successful but soon theyre not which is where the movie begins The dinosaurs bigger and stronger than ever are starting to win. Charlie Hunnam plays an impetuous rough-around-the-edges pilot a courageous iconoclast who is iconoclastic in the exact same way as every other action hero. He also has the misfortune of looking so much like one of the supporting players Robert Kazinsky that unless theyre both on the screen it takes about a minute to figure out who is who. Guys flip a coin Tails grows a mustache. Director Guillermo del Toro who gave us ""Pans Labyrinth"" not too many years ago used to be known as an artistic and discerning filmmaker despite his affection for blockbuster action and grotesqueness. But too often he gets lost in his computer. Here is what passes for clever in ""Pacific Rim"" A dinosaur sprouts wings grabs a metal giant and flies high into the air. Or another one A metal giant picks up two train cars and boxes a dinosaurs ears with them. Some to be sure will love these moments but they reek of the computer screen. Why go to the movies to look at somebody elses computer after looking at your own all week? The Japanese actress Rinko Kikuchi succeeds in giving an inward and thoughtful performance as an aspiring pilot despite the commotion surrounding her. And Burn Gorman and Charlie Day as a mismatched pair of bickering eccentric scientists provide some comic relief. But ""relief"" is the word to stress here. The actors cant make ""Pacific Rim"" any better. They can only relieve some of the pain. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

When you looked beyond the guy in the cheesy rubber costume who was trampling on a miniature Tokyo the original ""Godzilla"" was actually a pretty good movie. Thats because the radioactive monster meant something especially to a Japanese people who had suffered so much devastation in World War II.""Pacific Rim"" is Guillermo Del Toros take on ""Godzilla"" yet the monsters (plural) are meaningless adversaries mere punching bags for the giant robots on which the director lavishes his love. The movie is an eyeful especially in 3-D but even with humans at the helms of the machines its a hollow exercise in homage.Along with monster movies Del Toro seems to be spoofing flyboy films. When giant creatures rise from a rift in the Pacific Ocean floor humanitys best defense is an army of towering ""Transformers""-style robots that are operated by handsome hotshots. The pilots work in tandem teamed with a friend family member or sibling with whom they can ""drift"" -- i.e. coordinate their thoughts and movements. In this game of Rockem Sockem Robots for the Wii generation the champion is Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam). After the combat death of his brother Raleigh is relegated to a construction job but hes lured out of retirement by Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) a renegade commander who plans to lead a last stand against the giant reptiles in Hong Kong Harbor before the politicians pull the plug and retreat to their bunkers.Pentecost partners Raleigh with Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) a Japanese orphan who can avenge her parents death if she can control her emotions. Meanwhile comic-relief scientist Dr. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) believes he can predict the monsters next move if he can obtain one of their brains from a black-market parts collector (Ron Perlman). The human element of the movie which is wrapped in laughable comic-book dialogue is just a pretext for a special-effects spectacular. Del Toro (""Pans Labyrinth"" ""Hellboy"") is fluent in fantastical imagery and here hes working in a vertical scale that is often impressive as the combatants loom large over the cities and seascapes. And yet the gimmick of the robots mimicking the movements of their human controllers keeps the smack-down action compacted and coherent.Its too bad that the meaning of the movie isnt as clear or as forceful as the fight sequences.

Rated PG-13 (action brief language) BOTTOM LINE Battle after battle with zero thought to story or character. Even hard-core anime and manga fans might find this a drag. CAST Idris Elba Charlie Hunnam Rinko Kikuchi LENGTH 211 I love playing make-believe with my 5-year-old son who has no use whatsoever for narrative structure the laws of physics or simple logic. Swords outdraw pistols stuffed animals develop superpowers the Lightning Duplo Jet battles the Thunder Pirate Car in outer space. Its all very endearing even though my adult brain shuts down after about an hour of incoherent playtime. ""Pacific Rim"" a movie about giant sea monsters called Kaiju versus giant robots called Jaegers feels for all the world like it was made by a 5-year-old but it was directed and co-written by Guillermo del Toro who is 48. It lasts more than two hours. And there is nothing endearing about it. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Its a departure for Del Toro whose distinctive style has elevated the horror and comic-book genres (""Pans Labyrinth"" ""Hellboy""). Here hes indulging his inner fanboy the one who watched countless monster movies and reruns of ""Giant Robot"" hoping to one day make his own big-screen version. He has succeeded In terms of acting dialogue and overall intelligibility ""Pacific Rim"" is every bit the equal of say 1974s ""Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla."" ""Pacific Rim"" floats in a fantasy realm completely detached from grown-up reality. To fight the Jurassic-looking Kaiju humans somehow dreamed up edifice-size robots. Each Jaeger is powered by at least two mind-melded soldiers who simultaneously choreograph its martial-arts moves. (Think ""Real Steel."") The machines fanciful nicknames -- Crimson Typhoon Gipsy Danger -- sound more like Hot Wheels than World War II bombers but then the platoons commander is named Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba). The story lines are mere formalities A chaste eew-free romance blossoms between Jaeger veteran Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam looking slightly concussed) and rookie Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi hair highlighted with manga blue) while an excitable scientist (Charlie Day providing comic unrelief) searches for a black-market Kaiju-parts dealer (Ron Perelman) who may have deeper answers. 233 MoviesPacific Rim trailer ""Pacific Rim"" is basically del Toro sprawled on his bedroom floor staging endless battles between a multipack of toy dinosaurs and a handful of Transformers. Im impressed by his imaginative spirit (""creativity"" seems not quite the right word) and he must have had fun with his reported 180 million budget.

Even hard-core anime and manga fans might find this a drag. ROCKING TOKYO WITH MONSTER HITS ""Pacific Rim"" opening Friday harks back to one of Japans greatest exports -- those cheesy monster movies of the 50s and 60s -- but done on a larger scale. Here are some of the most memorable big-screen creatures who chewed up the scenery -- and half of Tokyo. GOJIRA (aka GODZILLA) (1954) -- Still the granddaddy of reptilian movie monsters. For the 1956 reissue new scenes were added featuring a Raymond Burr and awful English dubbing. Many sequels followed including the 1962 smackdown ""King Kong vs. Godzilla."" MoviesThe 25 biggest box office hits of all time RODAN (1956) -- Sure its a creature feature -- giant pterodactyl Rodan blows into a mining village and creates destructive winds with his wings -- but above all its the touching love story of Rodan and his mate with an ending worthy of Romeo and Juliet. advertisement | advertise on newsday MOTHRA (1961) -- Cinematic proof that music has charms to soothe the savage beast. When Tom Thumb-sized twins are captured by evil scientists their only hope is to sing out a telepathic cry for help from the titular gigantic moth. And if a few buildings must crumble so be it. GHIDORAH THE THREE-HEADED MONSTER (1964) -- Its like the Justice League of Japanese monsters as Godzilla Mothra and Rodan join forces to battle Ghidorah who pops up after a meteorite hits Japan.

Guillermo del Toro directed the haunting Pans Labyrinth (2006) and highly amusing Hellboy (2004) but here his nicely eccentric characters--Burn Gorman and Charlie Day as crazed scientists Ron Perlman as an outsize western hustler who calls himself Hannibal Chau--are swallowed up by the deafening monster mash.

"Pacific Rim | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; pacific-rim ) Pacific Rim (United States 2013) July 11 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Call it Godzilla (Toho version) on steroids. Or perhaps Transformers with a heart. Either way theres no mystery what Pacific Rim is and more importantly what it delivers. Its the perfect summer spectacle with giant robots pounding on monsters monsters stomping on cities and the kind of mayhem that only big theaters with big screens and big sound systems can truly convey. Theres not a single original moment to be found in Pacific Rims 130-minute running time but that doesnt much matter because the familiar beats are conveyed with maximum expertise intended to provide a visceral experience. The movie begins with a concise recap of what has gone before. Alien creatures called ""kaiju"" by the world media have arisen from a rift deep in the Pacific Ocean to wreak havoc on humanity. To counter this threat the world governments band together to fund the ""jaeger"" program - giant robots piloted by two mind-linked humans that can go toe-to-toe with the kaiju. For a while the jaeger gain superiority and the pilots achieve rock star popularity. Then things start getting tough. The kaiju become bigger and more dangerous and the frequency of their appearances increase. The jaeger are systematically destroyed until there are only four left. The program is de-funded and led by Marshal Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) forced to go underground and work as a ""resistance."" At the height of the war Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) is an elite jaeger pilot but after his brother is killed and his robot severely damaged he disappears into obscurity. Now with the world on the brink Pentecost locates him and pulls him back into active duty. His robot has been reconstructed and upgraded. All he needs is a new co-pilot - something he finds in Pentecosts ward Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi). Their first trial run is a disaster but when a pair of kaiju attack Hong Kong and disable the other three jaerger theres no option but to send Raleigh and Mako into action. This Hong Kong battle which occurs about two-thirds of the way through the movie is without a doubt Pacific Rims highlight. Its an adrenaline-and-testosterone cocktail that fans of monster movies robot movies and high octane action films will swallow in a single gulp. This is bravura filmmaking that only top-notch special effects-comfortable directors can choreograph. The thing that really makes this work however is the human element. There are people inside the robots and Pacific Rim never forgets that. In fact it goes out of its way to develop and amplify the friendship/romance between Raleigh and Mako. Both are damaged souls searching for redemption and the chemistry between Charlie Hunnam and Rinko Kikuchi is effective enough to make us believe in these two as friends and future lovers. The primary difference between Pacific Rim and Transformers is easy to identify. For Michael Bay Transformers is all about the ""wow"" factor. Its about explosions robot-on-robot smackdowns and cutting edge special effects. Everything else is an annoying detail sometimes marginalized and often ignored. For Guillermo del Toro the ""wow"" factor is paramount as well but del Toro also cares about the other things character development relationships narrative progression and so forth. Transformers is an extended highlight reel; Pacific Rim is a complete film. Pacific Rim is all about visuals so a comment or two is warranted about the presentation. The 3-D is for the most part used effectively but as is often the case with this technology theres an issue. About 75% of Pacific Rim transpires at night or deep under the ocean where light is at a premium. 3-D by its nature diminishes the amount of light that reaches the viewers eyes and this becomes an issue. There are times when its difficult to see whats happening in 3-D. Take off the glasses however and the action becomes clearer even as the image turns fuzzy. The trade-off isnt necessary in 2-D. There are some pacing issues. The ""comic relief"" featuring Charlie Day and Burn Gorman as rival scientists is lame and distracting and has a smaller payoff than one might reasonably expect. The two actors play their roles broadly aiming for laughs by being spastic and off-the-wall; its not an asset. This subplot also gives a chance for the great Ron Perlman to make an appearance and although Perlman is always welcome the role is unnecessary. This is del Toros solution to avoid things becoming too serious and it doesnt really work. Because as soon as the movie cuts away from Day and Gorman its back to citywide devastation and thousands of people dying. A throwaway shot of Newtons Cradle is more chuckle-worthy than fifteen minutes of the antics of these two. Pacific Rim could be accused of an anticlimactic finale but thats because the Hong Kong battle is so good that it cant be topped by what happens in the final fifteen minutes. So in a strange way its more of a strength than a weakness. There are also some nice moments that have nothing to do with big-time special effects. One of the most memorable human scenes features Raleigh and Mako squaring off in hand-to-hand combat to determine if shes worthy of being his partner. And just about everything with Idris Elba is solida| but thats only to be expected. Pacific Rim shows what del Toro can do when given a big budget and free rein. Its not as thoughtful a piece as Pans Labyrinth but its every bit kick-ass as the two Hellboy movies. And although its a genre film with lots of pyrotechnics its not so stupid that it requires disclaimers to go along with a positive review. Its big loud and fun but doesnt leave the viewer feeling vaguely insulted about the filmmakers opinion of whos watching. Del Toros nearly fanboy-ish joy for the genre shines through but its also apparent that understands how to make a good movie and thats a differentiator between this and many seemingly similar tent pole productions.

"Review Pacific Rim is ultimate summer thrill ride - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Pacific Rim is ultimate summer thrill rideBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News correspondentPosted 07/09/2013 041108 PM PDTUpdated 07/10/2013 054338 PM PDT In a supremely adolescent way ""Pacific Rim"" unshackles the geeky kid inside all of us so he can stomp around for a couple hours like Godzilla on a miniature city.Thats right skeptics Guillermo del Toro the fan boy fave who gave us the classic ""Pans Labyrinth"" and the spirited ""Hellboy"" movies has done it again. His futuristic fight club pitting robots against monsters is this summers biggest surprise and ultimate thrill ride. The 3-D production rumored to have cost up to 180 million and looking to overcome a so-far pallid buzz delivers the blockbuster goods with vigor spectacle and polish. Technically its a remarkable achievement from the director and his ace special effects team. You will be awed and then awed even more. And dont summarily dismiss the tight screenplay a joint venture from Travis Beacham and del Toro. It more than holds the action together.""Pacific Rim"" grabs you at the start with a voice-over prologue that fills in the back story of this epic war between man and monster. That its partially set to scenes of the Golden Gate Bridge getting hammered by a critter from the depths makes it all the more compelling.And thats just the beginning of the effects handiwork and rampant destruction. There are several other highlights.Advertisement In a sort-of flashback a cowering Japanese girl clutches a shoe while a terrible thug of a monster chases her after dispensing with her parents (the dispensing is not shown on camera).Later on in Hong Kong a humongous robot uses an ocean liner as club to bash a monster in one of the best and most tightly choreographed fight scenes. Monster mayhem like that should captivate legions of moviegoers who once sat riveted in front of TV sets watching ""Ultraman"" ""Rodan"" and even ""Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster"" (theres a go-green message here too). Now these old favorites get a modern tweaking with just the right nostalgic sentiment intact.Add in a decent cast -- high-caliber actor Idris Elba (TVs ""Luther"") a strapping Charlie Hunnam (TVs ""Sons of Anarchy"") and an appealing Rinko Kikuchi (""Babel)"" -- and you have just the right amount of talent mixed in with the loud destruction.Elba definitely classes things up as Stacker Pentecost leader of a dwindling hotshot group of ""Jaeger"" pilots who team in pairs and meld minds to operate massive robots designed to kill ""Kaiju"" -- monstrosities that look like hybrids from a ""Hellboy"" movie and a Toho studio production.In a last-ditch effort to save the world Elba oversees an operation that brings back Raleigh Beckett (Hunnam). Raleighs cockiness led to a tragedy that still haunts him. He eventually teams up with and is attracted to expert fighter Mako (Kikuchi) who is often by Stackers side. Meanwhile a research team that includes Newton Geizler (Charlie Day) and Hermann Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) tries to find out what makes these critters tick.Day and Gorman provide the most humor as does del Toro regular Ron Perlman as a black market dealer of critter parts. Youll love his stylin outfits and footwear.All are quirky and engaging characters refreshingly different from the blockbuster norm.But lets be honest here. The reason we show up is to see the robots vs. monsters fight scenes and theyre exciting to behold. Too bad del Toro fires off his best shots early on though because by the time the climactic showdown happens it cant compare to the sequences that came before.Still thats hardly a deal breaker. ""Pacific Rim"" leaves us cheering and wanting more. Stay through the end credits as well for a little something extra.Most of all its refreshing to see del Toro terraform the blockbuster world. This film isnt a mere sequel or something based on a superhero saga we know well. ""Pacific Rim"" creates its own language and its own mythology and the result is one gloriously entertaining vision that leaves us in wide-eyed wonder. This film image released by Warner Bros.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Money hasnt changed Guillermo Del Toro its just increased the size of his sandbox. With Pacific Rim the director of Pans Labyrinth and the Hellboy movies has mounted his first bona-fide blockbuster in which human-controlled robots wage war on an invading army of God-sized monsters. Every penny of the gargantuan budget is right up there onscreen applied not just to the apocalyptic battles but also to the little cosmetic details--the digs and the duds--of the films near-future world. Yet for all its expensive grandeur almost too epic even for the vast canvases of IMAX Pacific Rim is unmistakably a Del Toro creation. Who but this puckish Mexican auteur would think to include a mind-meld between a squirrelly scientist and a removed monster brain or to cast Ron Perlman as a black-market bone salesman named Hannibal Chau? In what feels like a corrective to current blockbuster trends Pacific Rim largely forgoes origin-story wheel spinning opting instead to cram all the set-up into a speedy opening montage. Proving that exposition goes down much smoother when it features Godzilla-like behemoths this years-spanning prologue establishes the basics of Del Toros premise When an inter-dimensional oceanic rift unleashes enormous creatures--dubbed ""kaiju"" in reference to the Japanese monster movies that inspired them--Earths leaders commission a fleet of giant battle bots to destroy the invaders. That Pacific Rim is set 12 years into the war after many of the cities have already been leveled speaks volumes about the directors sensibilities. Unlike Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich those maestros of grand-scale destruction Del Toro is more interested in creating new worlds than blowing up old ones. (He could set a whole movie at The Bone Slums a Hong Kong ghetto built around and within the skeleton of a fallen beast.) Del Toros interests clearly do not lie with Pacific Rims narrative a hodge-podge of cliches about overcoming trauma; he pairs a ""has-been"" (Charlie Hunnam) still mourning the death of his brother with a ""rookie"" (Rinko Kikuchi) consumed with thoughts of revenge. Theyre essentially fighter pilots but with a twist It takes two minds linked through a process called drifting to mentally operate the mighty machines. Thats the films most imaginative conceit a nifty sci-fi metaphor for the emotional fusion that sometimes occurs between soldiers. Not that Del Toro does much with it or with any single idea. His summer movie is a spare-part contraption wedging together elements not just from Toho monster movies and giant-robot anime but also Top Gun 90s disaster movies Starship Troopers Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind and Del Toros own oeuvre. At one point the squadrons stern leader (Idris Elba commanding in a stock role) delivers a pep talk virtually identical to Bill Pullmans inspirational speech in Independence Day. Everything about the movie feels a little secondhand. Yet what Pacific Rim lacks in originality it largely makes up for in boyish enthusiasm--an infectious affection for cocky flyboys titanic mechanical men and (especially) the mythically colossal villains. (Charlie Day as a motor-mouthed egghead fascinated by the kaiju is essentially Del Toros surrogate.) Dyed-in-the-wool Godzilla fans will appreciate the minor-key blare that accompanies the monsters rampages as well as a city-in-ashes flashback that evokes the somber tone of the 1956 original. The big fight scenes are a little hard to follow (especially in 3-D which only amplifies the murkiness) but theyre playful with the filmmaker sometimes lingering on a tiny comical detail like a flock of blissfully unaware birds.

Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review 1/2 out of fourStars Charlie Hunnam Idris Elba Rinko Kikuchi Charlie Day Ron PerlmanRated PG-13; Runtime 2 hours 11 minutes; Opens Thursday in select cities and Friday nationwideFor those who like their alien-invasion movies to bludgeon the senses Pacific Rim fits the bill.This is Godzilla meets Transformers with elements of the lesser Star Wars movies all awash in thunderously loud non-stop demolition.While there is some eye-popping production design that occasionally is reminiscent of Blade Runner this sci-fi adventure ( 1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opens Thursday in select theaters and Friday nationwide) descends into mind-numbing mash-ups with the simplest of stories buried under overbearing special effects.Legions of gargantuan alien creatures called Kaiju emerge from the Pacific Ocean and wreak havoc on coastal areas from Alaska to Australia. Countries bordering the Pacific band together and devise a method of fighting by arming massive robots called Jaegers whose movements are controlled by pairs of closely synced pilots.STORY In del Toros Pacific Rim mankind stands tall tooMORE Rim was a monstrous special-effects challengeINTERACTIVE Meet the Rim robots and monstersVIDEO Pacific Rim stars welcome Kanyes TweetsFor the first half-hour or so the film is exuberant then spectacle settles into tedium. Following an exceedingly predictable playbook Pacific gets points for a diverse cast though no one is allowed to exercise much in the way of acting skills or human appeal. Its essentially all combat all the time and its hardly a mystery which side will win.Directed by Guillermo del Toro the mastermind behind the hauntingly wonderful Pans Labyrinth and the rousing Hellboy series Pacific is surprisingly repetitive and tedious. Clearly influenced by classic Japanese monster movies del Toro checks all nuance and character development at the door. His focus is solely on creature mayhem. The alien invaders can appear sharklike or at other times like dinosaur variations sometimes sporting octopus tentacles or giant wings.While fanboys may be delighted it will not hold the average spectators attention. Sequences sometimes feel akin to watching people play an intricate video game.Theres a bland romance between Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam) a pilot down on his luck and Mako (Rinko Kikuchi) a mysterious aspiring flier. They drive an early-model Jaeger in Earths last hope for survival. In charge of the operation is blustery Jaeger Comm. Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba).REVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYGUIDE USA TODAYs summer movie calendarThe mind-meld between the two pilots operating the robots is a process known as ""drift."" But if a pilot gets too caught up in memories it can throw off strategic maneuvers as it does with both Mako and Raleigh who have suffered familial losses at the mammoth paws claws and jaws of the Kaiju. A recurring flashback to Makos childhood after a particularly shattering attack is the movies only compelling aspect recalling some of the emotional horrors of Pans Labyrinth.Ordinarily a nuanced actor Elba spends most of his time bellowing. Hunnam and Kikuchi have no chemistry. Humor is in short supply arriving only sporadically via Dr. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) a wacky scientist initially dismissed as a ""Kaiju groupie"" by the cringingly unfunny mathematician Gottlieb (Burn Gorman). Ron Perlman shows up and does little as Hannibal Chau a guy who traffics in black-market Kaiju parts.For those not fascinated by two hours of unabated robot vs. alien smackdowns the movie holds little appeal. 324 CONNECTTWEET 2 LINKEDIN 89 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/16qNA4i",http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~r/UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories/~3/G5FzBuEzHrQ/,200,pacificrim23,pacificrim,usatoday

Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on July 11 2013 at 534 AM updated July 17 2013 at 321 PM comments ""Pacific Rim"" is the kind of movie I would have loved when I was 10 years old. It has gargantuan saurian monsters emerging from the ocean and trampling every coastal metropolis they can find. It has enormous mechanical soldiers battling them with uppercuts and devastating right hooks. It is ""Godzilla Vs. the Rock em Sock em Robots"" and what more could any fourth-grader want? Of course Im not in fourth grade anymore as Im reminded of every night I try to make dinner out of a tub of salty popcorn and a vat of Coke. And truth be told ""Pacific Rim"" isnt much more nourishing. But at times its almost as much guilty fun. The movie comes from Guillermo del Toro who is part guiltless fanboy (""Hellboy"" ""Blade II"") and part dark poet (""Pans Labyrinth"" ""The Devils Backbone""). I prefer the dark poet side myself but his childlike enthusiasm can be infectious. This story imagines a sort of rift in the ocean floor from which giant creatures are emerging. Theyve slumbered for eons (vestiges of del Toros aborted Cthulhu movie?) but our pollution helped wake them up and now theyre coming to take over. They step on our tanks like ants swat away our fighter jets like flies. For such a mammoth threat clearly we need mammoth weapons. And so the worlds nations finally unite to create gargantuan machines clanking ham-fisted robots the size of skyscrapers -- each one piloted by two human fighters working in mind-meld unison to beat the invaders into oblivion. There is not much more to the movie than that set-up -- and about two straight hours of special effects following it -- and the part of me that is not still 10 years old missed the grownup stuff. You know like complicated characters. Or really thorny conflicts. Instead its all basic kiddie-matinee melodrama -- stern father figures sons trying to prove themselves -- and even that is overplayed. And the egghead-scientist comic relief is so over-the-top it wouldnt be out of place in an old Hong Kong film. That may be part of the point however. Most of the film is set in Hong Kong -- or at least a ""Blade Runner"" version of same -- and the co-star is Tokyos Rinko Kikuchi. The entire giant-monster-movie thing is a beloved Japanese genre anyway -- and all of this plays perfectly into Hollywoods new hunger for Asian markets. Although del Toros movies often have a fun performance or two -- and regular Ron Perlman shows up here as a black marketeer -- the cast is fairly bland. Idris Elba adds some authority as the ex-military man in charge of the robo-corps but Charlie Hunnam is immediately forgettable as our hero (so forgettable its hard to tell him apart from his rival the cocky Robert Kazinsky). But this movie isnt about stars. Besides Guillermo del Toro that is. And after two failed in-development projects and five years away from the screen you can really feel the fun hes having here. The spectacle of huge creatures destroying cities the sight of giant robots being helicoptered over the ocean to the battlefield -- every scene has the feel of a kid tugging your sleeve saying ""Isnt this cool""? Its not terribly witty; even by summer blockbuster standards its rather shallow. But its innocent in its own way -- never crass or willfully stupid the way the ""Transformers"" movies can be. And if youre 10 years old or just want to feel that way for a couple of hours ""Pacific Rim"" provides everything you need except the Twizzlers. Ratings note The film contains violence and some strong language. Pacific Rim (PG-13) Warner Bros. (131 min.) Directed by Guillermo del Toro. With Charlie Hunnam Rinko Kikuchi Idris Elba.

"Pacific Rim a complete sensory experience review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesPacific Rim a complete sensory experience reviewGetting in touch with your inner 12-year-old as Guillermo del Toro hopes you will has never been this big or loud -- or awesome.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. July 11 2013Pacific RimStarring Charlie Hunnam Rinko Kikuchi Idris Elba Rob Kazinsky Charlie Day and Ron Perlman. Directed by Guillermo del Toro. 131 minutes. Opens July 11 at major theatres. PGGetting in touch with your inner 12-year-old as Guillermo del Toro sincerely hopes you will with his robots vs. monsters mash-up Pacific Rim has never been this big or loud.Or awesome it must be said. Even if you smirk at the plot conceit of mind-linked humans inside skyscraping robots fighting blockbuster sea beasts the technical prowess on display cant help but impress.Article Continued BelowYou dont just see and hear these frame-filling behemoths -- as they smash and bash each other in coastal cities across the globe -- you also feel them.Its hard not to be impressed by the technical prowess on display in Pacific Rim.  (Warner Bros. Pictures)  Charlie Hunnam and Rinko Kikuchi uphold the human element in a movie in which robots and monsters take centre stage.  (Kerry Hayes / Warner Bros. Pictures)  In mounting this tribute to the Japanese movie monsters he has adored since childhood -- dino-sized Godzilla of course but also the likes of multi-headed Ghidorah spiky Rodan and winged Mothra -- del Toro and his team have laboured to make a complete sensory experience.Theres a weight and depth to these Kaiju (monsters) and Jaegers (robots) much more than there is to Michael Bays Transformers the understandable but not-so-accurate comparison. Every thud pow and bam registers in your bones thanks to advanced CGI skilled camera placement and 3D that actually works. These beasts and bots also have distinct colours glowing with unearthly luminescence as they rise out of the sea by way of ""the breach"" a molten rift at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. Watching the Toronto-filmed Pacific Rim is often akin to staring at a vivid fireworks display or animation on hi-def TV with the colours turned way up.Del Toro hasnt forsaken the human element of his film although no one is going to look to Pacific Rim for any acting nominations come awards time (the technical categories will be a whole other story).There are no A-listers among the cast and the plot is as skeletal as you can get brave humans build and operate Jaegers to battle a scourge of Kaiju that keep threatening to stomp the planet into sawdust.Still theres definite rooting interest in the story of a burned-out Jaeger pilot Raleigh Beckett (Charlie Hunnam) joining with promising rookie Mako Mori (Babels Rinko Kikuchi) to suit up in a clanking robotic antique to grapple with advanced versions of the ever-evolving Kaiju whose spiked snouts and sharp claws can tear into a Jaeger like a massive can opener.The goofiest angle of the jargon-heavy script by Travis Beacham (with del Toro) demands that two pilots are required to operate each Jaeger. They must be mentally conjoined through a process called ""drifting"" that also leads to shared emotions. (Think of the Vulcan mind meld writ large).The pilots have ornery humans to contend with too. Theres a stiff-necked commander (Idris Elba) a mocking rival pilot (Rob Kazinsky TVs True Blood) and a meddlesome underworld trafficker of Kaiju parts (Ron Perlman). Most troublesome of all are the faceless government bureaucrats who foolishly believe that building giant walls to keep out the monster is better than fighting them (we saw how well that idea worked in World War Z).The Jaeger pilots are obliged to act like the sheriff in High Noon taking on ever more powerful foes at increasingly long odds of success. Still even a lesser-value Jaeger suit allows humans to ""fight the hard game"" against the Kaiju Beckett tells us via voiceover narrative and right now its the only game in town.There is comic relief in the presence of two eggheads played by Charlie Day and Burn Gorman who constantly spar with each other even as they are obliged to work together to study the traits of the Kaiju who may not be the dumb brutes everybody assumes they are.And Pacific Rim isnt so dumb either although you could be forgiven for thinking at first glance that its just a big-screen version of the old Rockem Sockem Robots game that enlivened many a rec room.Through the welcome presence of Rinko Kikuchi del Toro has taken pains to put an intelligent and resourceful woman into his testosterone-rich scenario and thats more than you can say about the Transformers franchise where females are little more than eye candy.Robots monsters and gender equality too? Pacific Rim is more than just a blockheaded blockbuster.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

For general audiences this picture will no doubt appear as a high-tech summer action spectacle in the ""Transformers"" mode but one made with superior cinematic craft and a profound appreciation for the classic monster-attack movies of the 1960s. This is escapist entertainment on a grand scale with only dim and distant connections to contemporary social or political reality. In between the impressive oceanic throw-downs between gigantic interdimensional beasties and colossal human-powered fighting machines we get all the ancillary ingredients required by the genre macho confrontation and comradeship a lot of military-bureaucratic texture a smidgen of romance some zany character comedy. What politics the movie possesses are minimal and arguably reactionary Governments all over the world have peed their drawers when faced with a real-life ""existential threat"" and its up to real men (and giant robots) to resist the invading monster hordes.Then there are all the film buffs critics and so forth whove followed the twists and turns of del Toros peculiar career with all its unfinished projects impossible dreams and executive-producer credits. (He was supposed to direct the ""Hobbit"" movies - sigh - and he was supposed to adapt H.P. Lovecrafts ""At the Mountains of Madness"" - triple sigh) If that describes you ""Pacific Rim"" draws a line in the sand and dares you to cross it with a discordant otherworldly roar. Except that you wont find any sand in this movie - its all rain-soaked sci-fi cityscapes and roiling Pacific Ocean - and I was having so much fun I lost track of where the line between good-stupid and bad-stupid might lie. Suffice it to say that if you were hoping for an allegorical and/or political fairy tale in the mode of del Toros 2006 masterpiece ""Pans Labyrinth"" you wont find it here. His first film as a director in five years finds del Toro in maximally geeked-out fanboy mode the mode of the ""Hellboy"" films and ""Blade II"" fulfilling a promise I imagine him making to himself as a teenage boy back in Guadalajara circa 1980 while he was watching ""Ghidorah the Three-Headed Monster"" for the seventh time As God is my witness one day Ill make a movie as badass as this oneMy advice is that you have to honor this movie at that level or leave it alone. If you feel no affection toward the Japanese ""Kaiju"" monster movies of the 50s and 60s from ""Godzilla"" onward or for other related pop-culture streams that flow into ""Pacific Rim"" - the giant-robot anime of the 80s or the ""henshin"" tradition of shows like ""Ultraman"" in which an oversize anthropomorphic hero defends humanity from alien invaders - then quite likely this isnt the del Toro picture for you. I found the storytelling and characters in ""Pacific Rim"" highly appealing but theyre built to conform to genre norms and stereotypes or maybe to max them out to the point of distortion but not quite to subvert them and still less to appear ""naturalistic."" Someone in my Facebook universe described ""Pacific Rim"" as del Toros version of ""Kill Bill"" meaning that its a personal declaration of love and loyalty to a disreputable popular genre and an attempt to make that kind of movie as good as it can be. That just about nails it.""Pacific Rim"" opens with a lot of dense exposition delivered in voice-over by Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam of ""Sons of Anarchy"") the hotshot flyboy who will be our nominal hero. This may reflect del Toros awareness that this movies youthful target audience may not be all that familiar with the Kaiju universe. (If you too are confused Wikipedia and this fine explainer by Vultures Nick Schager should help.) Ordinarily in movie criticism youre supposed to treat this sort of thing as a flaw am I right? While we look at TV images of Barack Obama ruined cities and steaming piles of monster excrement Raleigh explains that giant beasts from another dimension called Kaiju are coming through a crack in the ocean floor (just a touch of the never-gonna-happen Lovecraft project there) but we built some colossal rock em-sock em robots called Jaegers (German for ""hunter"") to fight them so big they have to be controlled by two human pilots who become psychically fused in something called the Drift. Got all that? Good. Now let me get out of the way so you can swoon over Idris Elba. You Might Also Like If you thought Raleigh Becket sounded like a computer-generated action-hero name (and/or an obscure historico-literary joke) I give you the remarkably charismatic Elba - star of ""The Wire"" ""The Office"" and ""Luther"" among other things -- as a hardass order-barking commander type called Stacker Pentecost who sort of sneaks up on us as the movies real dramatic centerpiece. Theres a Dickensian functionality to these monikers How could a guy called Stacker Pentecost not be an entirely awesome leader with a dark personal secret who is by the living Christ going to command your respect and doesnt give a flying Kaiju crap whether you like him? When youve got a murky rain-swept mid-Pacific battle sequence between a thermonuclear-armed Jaeger and a giant Kaiju called Knifehead or whatever happening every few minutes the switchbacks of the plot are not so much the point. But lets just say that Raleigh and Stacker go from being heroes to bums after the Jaeger program goes sour and Raleigh spends a few years working construction on the giant Alaska-to-California wall that politicians have chosen as the means of preventing the Kaiju from stomping any more major metropolises. It doesnt work. (Yes in a movie by a Mexican director that may just strike a resonant chord in the real world.)While del Toro and co-writer Travis Beacham never really explain the screwed-up geopolitical backdrop theres terrific deep-focus texture to all the sets and locations here including the dystopian-proletariat world of the wall-builders and the ""Matrix Reloaded"" ambience of the Hong Kong base where Stacker now gone rogue in a ""Henry V"" vein has set up a last-ditch Jaeger fortress aimed at saving the world. Would it shock you if I suggested that his band of brothers his collection of rogues misfits and rust-bucket robots including a PTSD-afflicted Japanese woman (the terrific Rinko Kikuchi) and a pair of nerdball brilliant scientists (Charlie Day and Burn Gorman) - along with a slimy black-market dealer in Kaiju parts (del Toro regular Ron Perlman) -- turns out to have just the right combo of courage pluck and brains? I didnt think so. As for the all-digital battle sequences while theyre worlds better than Michael Bays patented Incohero-Vision they could have used more light and clarity - or maybe just more establishing shots where we can tell whos whomping on whom. (I attended a 3-D IMAX screening in Manhattan and while it was great to have that huge screen Ive heard anecdotally that the 2-D image is cleaner as usual.) This is a noisy chaotic technology-crazed 21st-century action film but also one made with tremendous excitement vigor and heart along with a myriad of wonderful details. (One of the scientists has a piece of living Kaiju brain in a tank and it has this questing dangling tentacle appendage that I really really really hope not to dream about ever.) Will I be disappointed if del Toro stays in this mode and at this production level for the rest of his career and steers away from more intimate projects? Absolutely. Am I disappointed with ""Pacific Rim"" as it is in all its bigness and dumbness and its thrilling if slightly self-mocking city-stomping Kaiju revelry? Oh hell no. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

RELATED NEWS 5 essential Guillermo del Toros films By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Wed Jul 10 2013 1029 AM Despite what we all may have suspected ""Pacific Rim"" is not a big summer blockbuster. It is a huge summer blockbuster whose enormity of scale is far beyond anything seen before. The alien monsters and the human-piloted robots that fight them dwarf the comparatively scrawny machines in the ""Transformers"" movies as does the relative intelligence brought to bear by director and co-writer Guillermo del Toro. Which isnt to say that ""Pacific Rim"" is a smart movie. Not at all. (See ""relative"" above.) Its big and loud and kind of dumb and predictable. The difference is that in del Toros hands its meant to be. Perhaps its giving him too much benefit of the doubt based on such freak-out exercises as ""The Devils Backbone"" and ""Pans Labyrinth"" but even with the unimaginable size of the whole thing one never gets the feeling that del Toro loses control of the effects and battles. They serve him not the other way around. Is it all too much? Good heavens yes. Thats the point. If youre not expecting an all-out sensory assault boy have you wandered into the wrong movie. How big are we talking? One of the robots uses an aircraft carrier as a weapon. A hand-held weapon. Also so big that the monsters and robots dwarf things like human actors and character development which is more problematic. The film is set in the near future when as we learn in a voiceover the kaiju building-size monsters begin springing up from the ocean every now and then to destroy coastal cities. All the worlds countries pool their resources and build the jaegers German for ""hunters"" to fight back. These gigantic robots are so big it takes two people to pilot them. In the films most-interesting idea the pilots must form a neural bridge called ""the drift"" to operate the things. This also involves memories from their respective pasts which can prove tricky. Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) and his older brother Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff) are good at this until one day tragedy strikes during a battle and Becket wanders for a few years unwilling and unable to fight again. But hes found by his former commanding officer the brilliantly named Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) who persuades him to return to action as the kaiju are growing stronger and more resourceful their visits more frequent. Even though the worlds leaders have given up on the jaegers Pentecost believes theyre the only way to defeat the kaiju. The leaders are building an enormous wall to try to keep the creatures out. Building a wall is obviously a clear political statement about immigration that ... Hahahaha. Kidding. Although ""Pacific Rim"" is an obvious few notches above such mindless fare as ""Transformers"" on the intelligence scale something as complex as border walls is way beyond the scope of the film and the often-political del Toros intentions. There are a handful of other teams piloting the few remaining jaegers including a bottle-blond Russian couple who look like they wandered out of ""Rocky III."" But its obviously going to be Raleighs fight particularly after hes paired with the beautiful rookie Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) who shares a secret with Pentecost. There is some comic relief from Charlie Day and Burn Gorman as bickering scientists but del Toro for the most part is content to keep things serious with preparation for battles battles and recovery from battles comprising the bulk of the story. Its loud its long and theres never much doubt about where its headed. But ""Pacific Rim"" appears to be exactly the movie del Toro wanted it to be. Its not the best movie of the summer not by a long shot but if theres such a thing as smarter dumb fun this is probably it. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr MONSTER MASH Humanity unties to take a stand against horrific monsters from deep with the ocean in Pacfic Rim B- Pacific Rim Genre Action/Adventure; Starring Charlie Day Idris Elba Charlie Hunnam Ron Perlman; Director Guillermo del Toro; Release Date Wide 07/12/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 131; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted July 19 2013 -- 1200 AM EDT No one can question Guillermo del Toros passion for Japanese monster movies. The fanboy-friendly director who earned his Comic-Con bona fides by crafting oddball fantasias including Pans Labyrinth and the Hellboy films has spoken at length about being weaned on creature double features as a kid in Mexico. And it wasnt just the granddaddy of all man-in-a-rubber-suit behemoths Godzilla who cracked open his mind. He also swooned over the more esoteric beasties in Toho Studios kaiju (i.e. giant monster) stable -- titanic brutes like Mothra Megalon and Mechagodzilla. It goes without saying that the mans geek credentials run deep. Now with his latest film the gargantuan monsters-vs.-mammoth-robots smackdown Pacific Rim del Toro has somehow persuaded Hollywood to bankroll his tribute to the giddy junk food he grew up on. And thats exactly what the film feels like a 48-year-old kid playing with gigantic action figures in the worlds most expensive sandbox. Unfortunately his deep-rooted passion never quite makes the leap from his imagination to the screen. Set in the not-too-distant future Pacific Rim picks up after a string of apocalyptic sea-monster attacks have reduced San Francisco Manila and Cabo San Lucas to dust. It turns out that a breach in the bottom of the Pacific Ocean has ripped open and loosed an armada of kaiju. Humanity is defenseless against their massive razor-toothed maws and battering-ram limbs -- at least until the militarys high-tech Jaeger program is conceived. The Jaegers (German for ""hunters"") are 25-story robots operated by two human pilots whose minds are neurally linked in a process called ""the drift."" The Jaegers are only as good as their operators who must be able to read each others thoughts and intuit each others next moves. Go-it-alone rebels need not apply. But of course one does Raleigh Becket (Sons of Anarchys Charlie Hunnam) a hotshot pilot whose brother was killed in a kaiju rampage and whos so wild and unpredictable he might as well have the name ""Maverick"" stenciled on his helmet. It doesnt help matters that Hunnam has to bark goofy lines like ""Stay in the drift the drift is silence"" Silly dialogue is not the most serious problem with del Toros rock-em-sock-em monster mash. Weve come to expect a few groaners from our action spectaculars. But do the cliches need to be piled quite so high? Raleigh is a loner who must learn to trust his new partner (Babels Rinko Kikuchi) and heed the lessons of his stern commander (Idris Elba). Few of the actors leave much of an impression. And the ones who do (Charlie Day and Burn Gorman as a shrill pair of wacky scientists) are grating. Lets be clear though The main reason anyone wants to see a movie like Pacific Rim is to watch robots smack the snot out of monsters and vice versa. And thats where del Toro hits the biggest snag. The problem is a matter of scale. Pans Labyrinth cast such a spell partly due to the freaky details of a character like the Pale Man. The giant eye in the palm of his hand was designed with such jewelers precision that it was seared into your dreams (and nightmares) after you walked out of the theater. Here del Toros monsters are so big and shot in such unrelenting rainy darkness that the audience never gets a chance to dissect and fetishize their monstrous anatomies and be swept away by their weirdness. And if you cant be transported by a humongous calamari leviathan with suction-cup limbs projectile-vomiting bioluminescent goo thats an issue. I dont know if del Toro felt overwhelmed by the pressure of making a megabudget 3-D tentpole for the first time but there isnt enough of his bewitching poetic touch in the film. In a sense Pacific Rim winds up being not enough of a Guillermo del Toro movie. Its more like a mash-up of Real Steel and the Transformers pictures. Which is a shame because the idea is undeniably cool. But Id be surprised if a kid in Mexico or anywhere else walked out of Pacific Rim with a burning desire to direct a tribute to it when he or she grows up.

July 11 2013 -- 914am Video (3932)  When giant creatures from the deep attack nations join forces to save Earth. Matt Gillmer Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert Guillermo del Toro is one part art-house egghead and one part excitable pop-culture fanboy. His schizo tendencies operate in thrilling harmony in ""Pacific Rim"" a visually ornate improvisation on comic-book themes. Few directors could get so much creative mileage out of a giant robots vs. monsters adventure. Every frame is packed to bursting with images that delight the eye and tickle the mind. While the concept isnt original enough to make this an evolutionary leap for the genre its a glorious tribute to B-movie fire and fury. This is a megaproduction that winks at you as it reels by a movie about gargantuas punching each other that was made by a man who asked ""Why shouldnt this be beautiful?"" Its a film aimed at global audiences that genuinely reaches out to them with a cast of American Japanese black British Latino and even female performers. Its a conceptual twist on battle-the-aliens movies that shuns military jingoism giving its fighters lawman ranks like Marshal and Ranger rather than General and Captain. Its dark jewel-toned luster rebukes what Del Toro calls the ""car commercial/army recruitment video"" esthetics of many summer smash-ups. The characters all have risible cartoon names like Stacker Pentecost Hannibal Chau and Hercules Hansen. The time is a few years hence. A rift in the ocean floor unleashed Kaiju (Japanese for giant beasts) interdimensional exterminators that devastate coastal cities. Putting aside their petty conflicts nations band together to repel the invaders with skyscraper-tall Jaegers (German for hunters). Each war machine is controlled by a pair of pilots whose consciousness is joined by a neural link that gives each access to the others innermost secrets. Its only by being literally open-minded that they can save the day. Charlie Hunnam (of TVs ""Sons of Anarchy"") and Rinko Kikuchi (an Oscar nominee for the 2006 film ""Babel"") link lobes to combat new waves of ever-evolving increasingly destructive Kaiju. And what hand-to-hand battles they are epic mash-ups of ""Raging Bull"" and ""Godzilla."" Del Toro maps out these sequences masterfully drawing out the shape of a shot and how each would connect to the next. The camera perspective creates a sense of awe around these giants. They are almost never shown full-body inside the film frame. Theyre too big to be seen all at once filling the landscape. One robot holds a tanker ship like a billy club and beats his foe with it. By staging most of the battles at night (why would a monster attack in broad daylight when its a better target?) Del Toro allows us to imaginatively fill in the small strokes. In a nice touch the Kaiju have phosphorescent neon-blue blood that splatters satisfyingly. The design of the monsters is evocative of sharks crabs crocodiles and octopi. The robots are realized with passionate attention to detail. The American model suggests a sleek office tower moving with a John Wayne strut and the Russian entry is a hulking iron giant. Theres a sweet retro-futuristic look to the set and costume design. In this world every resource is funneled into fighting monsters so Idris Elbas corps commander wears vintage double-breasted suits the Russian Jaeger pilots dress in old cosmonaut gear and Clifton Collins communications officer reports to work in a zoot suit. The sets are all recycled scrap metal. Look fast and youll see that cities hit by attacks years earlier have simply rebuilt around the impossibly heavy immovable Kaiju skeletons. This is a gigantic movie crammed with minor but delicious details. If you ever wondered how a jaded urban pigeon would react to a monster throw-down see this movie. WARNER BROS. Rinko Kikuchi portrays Mako Mori in the mega-scaled action-packed ""Pacific Rim"" by director Guillermo del Toro. Unusual for a blockbuster ""Pacific Rim"" tries to balance the quality between scenes featuring dialogue and those involving cataclysms. Hunnam is a bit bland blond and generic as the lead but he comes alive when he and Kikuchi have a flirtatious fight with kendo staffs. Elba brings such gravitas to his role you feel as if hes holding you in a force field. He treats the lunatic story like its ""Henry V."" We get two different flavors of mad scientists. Charlie Day is a twitchy nerd who wants to mind-meld with a Kaiju brain and Burn Gorman is half Stephen Hawking and half Victor Frankenstein. Del Toros favorite Ron Perlman is spectacular as a black-market kingpin dealing in Kaiju innards. On that note hang around for the end credits. ""Pacific Rim"" is a guilty pleasure you dont need to feel too guilty about. It has a substantive subtext about learning to get along despite seemingly unbridgeable differences. It removes the remorse from city-smashing cataclysms by putting civilians in underground shelters. Above all unlike the glum ""Man of Steel"" and misfired ""Lone Ranger"" it is exhilarating exhausting irresistible fun.

"Review In Pacific Rim Del Toro makes magic with monsters - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review In Pacific Rim Del Toro makes magic with monsters Hero Complex Film Festival Guillermo del Toro talks Pacific Rim inspiration Director Guillermo del Toro talks about the childhood influences behind ""Pacific Rim"" at the 2013 Hero Complex Film Festival in Hollywood hosted by Gina McIntyre. Director Guillermo del Toro talks about the childhood influences behind ""Pacific Rim"" at the 2013 Hero Complex Film Festival in Hollywood hosted by Gina McIntyre. Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Guillermo del Toro is more than a filmmaker hes a fantasy visionary with an outsized imagination and a fanatical specificity a creator of out-of-this world universes carefully conceived down to the smallest detail. His particular gifts and passions are on display in the long-awaited ""Pacific Rim"" and the results are spectacular.This futuristic man versus monster tale is long-awaited because it has been five years since Del Toros last film seven since his masterpiece ""Pans Labyrinth."" Two major projects his version of ""The Hobbit"" and ""At the Mountains of Madness"" fell apart despite extensive work and ""Pacific Rim"" shows us what weve been missing. Unless you are a fan of the ""Godzilla""-influenced branch of Japanese popular cinema that inspired Del Toro and his co-writer Travis Beacham ""Pacific Rims"" plot of ferocious creatures called Kaiju facing off against massive robots called Jaegers may not frankly sound all that appealing.PHOTOS Robots kaiju and battles from Pacific Rim But filmgoers have learned that underestimating Del Toro and what he can do on screen is something done at your peril. Hes so accomplished a creator of images so adept at humanizing the monstrous so fearless an architect of awe that even without major movie stars in the cast the scenarios he throws himself into are invariably difficult to resist.Beginning in the near future ""Pacific Rims"" entertainingly complex back story starts with the outlandish notion that weve been looking in the wrong direction when weve worried about aliens invading Earth from another planet.Rather a fissure between two tectonic plates in the Pacific opens a portal between dimensions and the Kaiju strange and awful giant beasts intent on destroying everything in their path come up from the depths and begin laying waste to coastal cities like San Francisco.Humanity cooperates across national borders in the face of this terrifying threat and creates truly huge Jaegers weaponized robots so large (250 feet high) that it takes two people to pilot them. Not just any two however make effective collaborators. For a team to succeed something called ""The Drift"" a psychological state of oneness that sounds suspiciously like ""Star Treks"" venerable Vulcan mind meld must exist between the participants. When Jaeger teams initially meet with success these pilot pairings from around the globe become as popular as international rock stars.VIDEO Guillermo del Toro on Japanese pop culture influenceThe year is now 2020 and when ace Jaeger pilots Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam of TVs ""Sons of Anarchy"") and his brother Yancey (""Homelands"" Diego Klattenhoff) respond to a Kaiju attack just outside of Anchorage they get more than they expected. While earthlings were celebrating and getting cocky the Kaiju were biding their time changing evolving and adapting.Cut to five years later. Raleigh is now a drifter living off the grid as he copes with the aftermath of that day in Anchorage. Meanwhile the Kaiju have gotten so smart that the world community is about to abandon the Jaeger program and put its faith in a clearly dubious sea wall instead.The ultra-fierce Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba ""The Wires"" Stringer Bell) a former military man thinks he has a better idea. But he has only a few months to pull together a team of veteran pilots hole up in the Shatterdome facility in Hong Kong and facilitate his against-all-odds plan to bring the Kaiju to their knees. A plan that includes Stackers enigmatic protege Mako Mori (""Babels"" Rinko Kikuchi) a young Japanese woman with secrets of her own.Clearly were not talking about ""The Remembrance of Things Past"" here. ""Pacific Rim"" very much lives in comic book/pulp science-fiction territory complete with comic relief scientists (Charlie Day and Burn Gorman). But a number of factors combine to make it a deeper movie experience.For one thing this futuristic world has been carefully thought out and physically created with great skill. The visually gifted Del Toro has worked with his own team and the experts at Industrial Light amp; Magic to ensure that the monsters and the havoc they wreak look real. And the films delicate conversion to 3-D is a model of how to use the third dimension with maximum effectiveness.PHOTOS Movies Sneaks 2013Concerned with more than the big picture however ""Pacific Rims"" creators have fussed with thousands of small details to make the gritty dirty world of Shatterdome and surrounding Hong Kong (which owe an honorable debt to ""Blade Runners"" landmark look) as lived-in as possible. Unlike what can happen in other futuristic epics the flesh-and-blood people who inhabit this world have not been neglected. Expertly cast by Margery Simkin ""Pacific Rim"" utilizes many actors who have followings on TV including Del Toro veteran Ron Perlman which allows the film to capitalize on the work of talented people who have not worn out their welcome on the big screen.And though Del Toro could have used motion capture to depict the crucial scenes of the pilot teams actually operating the Jaegers he chose to do it in a much more old-fashioned and demanding way that emphasizes the physicality of the actors exertions. That in turn makes the situation more credible and enhances the crucial character/audience connection. Those who stay to the end of ""Pacific Rims"" credits will experience a particularly poignant moment. The last card standing is in memory of ""Monster Masters"" Ray Harryhausen the king of stop-motion animation and Ishiro Honda the director of ""Godzilla."" In a field rife with impostors and poseurs Del Toro like his mentors is the real deal. Its good to have him working his magic again.kenneth.turanlatimes.com---------------------------------Pacific RimMPAA rating PG-13 for sequences of intense sci-fi action and violence throughout and brief languageRunning time 2 hours 11 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Science Fiction (Movie Genre) Guillermo del Toro Pacific Rim (movie) Entertainment Movies Arts and Culture Burn Gorman Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-pacific-rim-20130711,0,4458733.story",200,pacificrim32,pacificrim,latimes
"Pacific Rim Review The folly of men with visual panache - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Pacific Rim The folly of men with visual panache Another generation of monsters of the deep emerge to threaten mankindJuly 11 2013|Michael Phillips | Movie critic (Kerry Hayes )The Summer of Loud continues this week with ""Pacific Rim"" full of sound and fury signifying nothing more than a monster movie in full roar. Director and co-writer Guillermo del Toros clever if rather wearying ode to Japanese sea-beast mythology is best enjoyed with a pair of earplugs and on a short nights sleep. That is to say Its closer to the hammering ""Transformers"" aesthetic than expected. Yet the weirdness around the edges saves it from impersonality.In this near-future scenario the valiant men and women of the Pan Pacific Defense Corps take on the amphibious dragons from the deep. Theres another battle afoot the battle between a fine directors strongest storytelling instincts and the clobbering prerogatives and perceived box-office requirements of a picture that needs to make hundreds of millions to break even.Weve encountered whole sections and flaming chunks of ""Pacific Rim"" many times before. Weve seen them in the training sequences in ""Avatar"" and the generic relationship banter of ""Starship Troopers"" and more to the water-based point the ""Godzilla""-inspired pictures released in the decades following World War II when irradiated beings and smog critters and other progeny of humankinds mistreatment of the planet gave us the retribution we so richly deserved.At the start ""Pacific Rim"" dispatches with the necessary expository blah-blah in delightfully forthright fashion. The audience is debriefed via extended montage on the emergence from beneath the ocean floor of the Kaiju prehistoric steroidal dinosaur-y visitors that come in a variety of shapes sizes and threat levels. They keep coming these Kaiju and they wipe out Manila San Francisco and other cities in short order. So the nations of the world settle their petty land disputes and political wars and agree to work together on a solution.Solution 25-story-tall human-made robots known as Jaegers controlled by two pilots strapped in and mind-melded in ""a neural bridge."" Its a tough job and many lives are lost in the battles but when a Kaiju war veteran (Charlie Hunnam) teams up with a newbie (Rinko Kikuchi) Earths rightful owners get a second chance.For anyone with an abiding affection for plus-size beasts here very large indeed ""Pacific Rim"" offers considerable visual panache of the digital effects variety. I wish the rooting interests among the heroes and heroines were stronger. Hunnams character has a brother (Diego Klattenhoff) also in the Corps also not very interesting. Max Martini and Rob Kazinsky portray an Australian father-and-son team in the Corps likewise given insufficient material to make us care about their fates.But del Toro has a few aces up his sleeve or rather in the control room overseen by Commander Stacker Pentecost (love that name). Idris Elbas the commander the one who delivers the rallying cry about how ""were canceling the apocalypse"" Hes a welcome presence. But hes no match for the mugging scientists and factotums lower down the chain. In modern-day monster movies too many performers favor an approach of deadpan under-reaction in the face of supernatural narrative occurrences. Not in ""Pacific Rim."" Watch what Clifton Collins Jr. Charlie Day and Burn Gorman manage here in fearsome close-up when theyre bugging out about the latest terrible development of the Category 4 Kaiju. They hit the panic button over and over and over like mice in some sort of ""feed me again"" lab experiment. Enormous tantrum-prone beings are on the rampage Overact like you mean it menRon Perlman a del Toro and fanboy god has a wonderful time as an underground dealer of Kaiju body parts. In effect hes into monster memorabilia -- the worlds most menacing comics emporium dealer. Perlmans fate is memorable for a host of slimy reasons and his storyline comprises a movie inside the larger movie much like the pilots operating inside the mechanical sluggers invented to vanquish the tourists from the center of the earth.Its noisy overscaled fun this picture and now and then a little poetry sneaks in to tantalize. My favorite moment is an underwater shot of the first major Kaiju just a-swimmin along in long shot about to rise above the waters surface to show us whats what. Tellingly the shots a second or two too short. But ""Pacific Rim"" has a lot on its plate and always another clash of the titans to prepare.mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating PG-13 (for sequences of intense sci-fi action and violence throughout and brief language)Running time 211Opens 7 p.m. Thursday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesHow Legendary is Trying to Turn Around Troubling Tracking...July 5 2013Summer Movies in Review Lone Rangers and Game ChangersAugust 26 2013A Place To Leave Your HeartMay 16 1999Find More Stories AboutPacific RimPanacheTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0709-pacific-rim-20130711,0,6550121.column",200,pacificrim33,pacificrim,chicagotribune

(Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Wednesday July 10 2013 420 PM Title Pacific Rim Film Info Humans build giant robots to defend against sea monsters from another dimension. Director Guillermo del Toro (211) PG-13; Violence. Area theaters. In 3-D. Opens Thursday night. There will be some 9-year-old boys wholl go crazy for the overcomplicated disappointing ""Pacific Rim."" Robots Robots fighting sea monsters And it takes two humans to run a robot But if your adult pulse doesnt jump at all that ""Rim"" will be as gripping as seeing a Transformer battle a toy dinosaur in a bathtub. Of course thats part of what co-writer-director Guillermo Del Toro (""Hellboy"") had in mind. The film nods to such 1960s guys-in-foamy-suit epics from Toho Studios as ""Destroy All Monsters."" If those memories are special ""Rim"" stomps all over them. The convoluted plot kicks off with a voiceover from Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) a pilot informing us that just before the year 2020 a breach in dimensions opened under the Pacific. That change let loose a monster parade (they look like the ""Cloverfield"" alien mixed with hammerhead sharks). As a defense mankind creates building-sized robots. Two pilots move Cirque du Soleil-style inside a robots head to operate the iron giants mind-melding with each other in a ""neural drift."" Rob Kazinsky as Chuck Hansen and Idris Elba as Stacker Pentecost in Pacific Rim. (Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures/Courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures) The monsters are called Kaiju -- pronounced KIE-zhu -- Japanese for ""strange beast."" The robots are ""Jaegers"" a German military word meaning ""hunter."" The Jaeger pilots are superstars of the future. When a kaiju kills his brother Raleigh drops out to help assemble a wall thatll keep the creatures contained while the Jaeger program is disbanded. Then Raleighs ex-commander (Idris Elba) asks him to pair with rookie girl pilot Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) rebuild the Jaegers and nuke the Kaiju nest. That synopsis doesnt even get into the fingernails-on-a-chalkboard scientists (Charlie Day Burn Gorman) hoping to learn from the Kaiju the lizardy huckster (Ron Perlman) selling Kaiju innards or Moris blah backstory. Laudable as its world-building is the film drags not just in its interminable middle hour but also during the redundant monster-on-mechawarrior smackdowns. One of the giant robots called Jaegers featured in Pacific Rim. (Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures) The 3-D is muddy and unnecessary and certainly doesnt make any of the half-dozen water troglodytes easier to see. Dimmer still is the trippy glimpse we get into the portal between dimensions. The most forgettable factor is one Del Toro -- eschewing the elegant shivers of his great ""Pans Labyrinth"" -- spends too much time on the people. Hunnams weird Brando-like delivery makes every one of his lines sound like his last name while Kikuchi is simply a geek-boys fantasy brought to life. The glowering Elba squirrelly Clifton Collins Jr. and all the flyboy rejects straight out of ""Aliens"" and ""Avatar"" are all equally tedious company. Turns out making a big-budget version of a rubbery monster film wasnt easy -- and neither is honoring those kitschy classics.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Review Pacific Rim Transformers Transcended Guillermo Del Toros robots-vs.-dinosaurs movie raises the question Why would a gifted director go to the trouble of outclassing Michael Bay? By Richard Corliss July 09 2013 Share Read Later Send to Kindle Warner Bros. Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture In 1924 the great silent-film director D.W. Griffith proposed a simple solution for resolving a dreadful war like the one that Europe had recently endured Choose one combatant from each side and let them duke it out winner take all. Griffiths idea never caught on in the world of realpolitik but lately Hollywood has applied it in a slew of action films. Who wants to see the teeming maneuvers of ordinary soldiers (unless theyre zombies)? Wouldnt you prefer the intimacy of brute-on-brute fist-into-face? In such movies as Thor The Dark Knight Rises and Man of Steel thats just what happens. God-men and brawny dudes take a break from killing or defending millions and decide the fate of planets in a cage match without the cage. Pacific Rim Guillermo del Toros 3-D Armageddon adventure extends this tactic to its ultimate Griffithian conclusion. It leaves the defense of besieged Earth entirely to the professionals. In a way thats considerate few civilians as collateral damage to be gobbled up or tramped on by the dinosaurish creatures called Kaiju (the Japanese word for ""strange beast"" as in the old Godzilla films) that have risen from the seas to devastate our coastal cities. In response the worlds military-fantasy complex calls on Jaegers (from the German for ""hunters""). Each of these giant robots in clanking humanoid form is manned by two Rangers expert fighters whose perfectly twinned minds activate the controls. Theyre not drone pilots aiming at targets in Africa or Asia from the comfort of a Virginia bunker. The Rangers are inside; they feel the Kaijus wrath. (READ Howard Chua-Eoan on the classic Godzilla movies by subscribing to TIME) In the script by del Toro and Travis Beacham ace Jaeger pilot Raleigh Becket (Sons of Anarchys Charlie Hunnam) who quit the Rangers after his brother died in battle gets called back to service by his old Commander Stacker Pentecost (The Wires Idris Elba). He is eventually paired with first-time pilot Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi the girl from Babel) herself orphaned in one of the earliest Kaiju attacks. Hovering on the sidelines are a pair of nerd scientists -- the would-be hipster Newt Geiszler (Charlie Day of Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia) and the purringly Teutonic Gottlieb (Burn Gorman from Torchwood) -- and the war profiteer Hannibal Chau (del Toro regular Ron Perlman) who collects Kaiju organs for research and resale. Hes in the spare-parts business. Pacific Rim (an oddly muted title for this choleric rave-up) is itself a spare-parts movie -- a massive collision of popular action films or maybe a Storage Wars with the emphasis on war. The picture certainly means to fill the summertime void in an odd-numbered year left by the absence of a Transformers episode; it has the same world-in-peril scenario similar rock-em-sock-em robots. The 1954 Godzilla spawned a couple dozen Japanese sequels and a teeming bestiary of dinosaur types (Rodan Mothra Gamera and their prehistoric pals) plus the sea monsters here. As in World War Z were plunked into the middle of an invasion with dinosaurs instead of the walking dead giving large cities the big hurt. (And this time we fight back with men inside machines.) Raleighs connection to his dead brother recalls the hero of Avatar whos recruited to Pandora because he shares his late twin siblings DNA. Like Top Gun this is an all-out recruitment PSA for the supercool machismo of combat. Pacific Rim could be called Transformatar or Top Gun-zilla. (READ Why Avatar is the best of the movies that Pacific Rim imitates) Since his 1993 feature debut with the sleek horror film Cronos made in his native Mexico del Toro has been quite the globe-trotting auteur shooting in the U.S. (Mimic) the Czech Republic (Blade II and Hellboy) Hungary (Hellboy II The Golden Army) and for Pacific Rim Canada. He also spent a frustrating two years in New Zealand preparing the Hobbit series before Peter Jackson stepped in and took back his favorite toys. (READ A review of Del Toros Hellboy II The Golden Army) The craggy humor and steampunk decor of del Toros mass-market thrillers earned him a host of admirers often including me. But his most esteemed features filmed in Spain are The Devils Backbone and Pans Labyrinth. In these art-horror tales set in the years just after the Spanish Civil War the director flexed a different more complicated set of movie muscles. The films creep instead of pound and their haunting spell can last a lifetime. (Del Toro may be one of the few filmmakers whose new 150-million action movie opens the same month that a Criterion Collection retrospective disc of another of his films -- 2001s The Devils Backbone -- is issued for connoisseurs.) (READ Corlisss review of the Del Toro masterpiece Pans Labyrinth) Del Toro must think that the human element informing his two Spanish pictures is way too analog for a robots-vs.-dinosaurs movie. So he doesnt bother. Theres little life in the drama of Raleighs return to the Rangers and his growing respect for Mako; or the threat that his brand of Jaegers will be replaced by a newer model; or the purported comedy of the goofy scientists. That part is dead air. The director poured all his enthusiasm and ingenuity into the grudge matches between the Kaiju and the Jaegers which shoot bullets at their prey and in desperation or just for kicks stun the beasts with a roundhouse punch Hulk Hogan-style. These fights are executed with a spectacular artistry that Michael Bay director of the Transformers trilogy could only dream of. For one thing consecutive shots actually ""match"" in classical Hollywood style rather than the eye-catching but incoherent melange of the Hasbro movies. In shallow or deep water at twilight or midnight the battles make spatial sense and build melodramatic suspense. And the Jaeger robots are handsome artifacts of sinewy metal; as Newt exclaims on seeing one ""Thats two-thousand five-hundred tons of awesome"" Purely from the perspective of action filmmaking Pacific Rim is Transformers transcended. (READ The secret behind Michael Bays Transformers movies) Which raises the question Why would Del Toro want to do that? Perhaps because as he quotes Orson Welles making a movie is like playing with ""the biggest electric train set a boy ever had."" In the book Pacific Rim Man Machines amp; Monsters del Toro adds ""we had an amazing sandbox full of robots monsters buildings and toy cars and we played with them endlessly."" In an end-of-the-world movie that aura of playfulness suggests a child inventing war games for his G.I. Joe figures as his parents argue in the next room -- a way to escape real anxieties by creating a grander fantasy peril -- and gives lift and life to the Kaiju-Jaeger mano-a-monstruo conflicts. But the rest of Pacific Rim is inert. You get 45 minutes of awesome encased in 90 minutes of yawnsome.

"Rooting for the Robots Pacific Rim Is Another in a Long Predictable Line of End-of-the-World Thrillers | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Culture Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters movie Rooting for the Robots Pacific Rim Is Another in a Long Predictable Line of End-of-the-World Thrillers Guillermo del Toros latest is ready for the junk pile By Rex Reed  07/09/13 447pm Charlie Hunnam and Rinko Kikuchi in Pacific Rim. Everyone knows summer is a dumping ground for rubbish. This year drifting around like bronchitis-laden pollen between the awful (The Lone Ranger) and the truly unspeakably awful (Grown Ups 2 The Heat) comes Pacific Rim another in a long predictable line of end-of-the-world fantasy horror and supernatural thrillers that always fail to thrill. This time when aliens invade the Earth to stamp out mankind its not from the stars but from a fissure under the Pacific Ocean. The result is being called by people with intelligence and taste Godzilla Meets Predator. I suppose some effort should be made to extend at least a one-star rating for computer graphics since that is all this incredible waste of time and money is about but dont look for anything that remotely resembles smart dialogue or inventive technology. Even the special effects are cheesy and stupid. I think the reason people pay actual money to see movies about death destruction and hopelessness in an alternate universe is that it gives them comfort to know theres a world out there more brutal chaotic noisy and pointless than the one theyre living in now. Maybe that explains why so many grown men no longer play poker. Now in a grave last-ditch effort to join the youth brigade they sit around playing violent video games and discussing the merits of endless installments of Iron Man The Avengers and The Wolverine. Bring back Ray Bradbury. In Pacific Rim millions of lives and cities that werent already destroyed by the zombies in World War Z have been wiped out by some kind of intergalactic holocaust leaving whats left of the human race hiding in peril from monsters called ""Kaijus."" Kaijus look like a cross between anthropomorphic sea urchins and T. rexes. The only way to fight them is to invent monsters of our own called ""Jaegers""--steel robots the size of the Chrysler Building with astronauts inside acting as pilots. Alas the Jaegers are getting wiped out faster than man can manufacture new ones and the Kaijus have adjusted to their Earth warriors faster than Disney can draw singing chickens. The last surviving pilot to operate inside a Jaeger is a man named Becket played by impossibly camera-ready Charlie Hunnam best known as the lovesick gay 15-year-old jailbait in the British TV series Queer as Folk. Joining forces with an untrained Japanese rookie (Rinko Kikuchi) Becket launches a 2400-pound mega-nuclear bomb against the remainder of the underwater Kaijus from inside an outdated condemned Jaeger that is ready for the junk pile. Like the movie itself. An hour and 20 minutes into this two-hour-and-11-minute endurance test a hungry Kaiju attacks the city of Hong Kong and eats the neon signs of every Cantonese restaurant in Victoria Harbor. Its sort of worth waiting around for. At one hour and 40 minutes they discover that the captured Kaiju is pregnant (would I make this up?) and all hell breaks loose. Theres another half hour still to go. Charlie Hunnam can act but he isnt required to do any of it here. While the rest of the hapless actors mouth idiotic dialogue by screenwriter Travis Beacham (Clash of the Titans) the noise of exploding robots and snapping fangs rises to an unbearable cacophony and you could make another film for half the budget in the time it takes to roll the end credits for CGI imaging. Theres stuff to look at but doesnt anybody care that it doesnt make a word of sense? Pacific Rim was directed more or less by Mexicos Guillermo del Toro. His debut film was a neat little horror called Kronos but I have personally disliked everything hes done since. I was not a fan of the labored overrated Pans Labyrinth and I hated the equally contrived and pretentious ghost story The Orphanage. The failure to impress is not reversed Im sorry to say with the agonizingly juvenile Pacific Rim. Maybe Mr. del Toro didnt know what a lunkheaded sci-fi comic book looks like on paper. Its important in a mindless frolic like this to find someone to root for but although the humans knock themselves out in Pacific Rim theyre pure cardboard. Sometimes youd much rather get to know the robots. rreedobserver.com PACIFIC RIM Written by Travis Beacham and Guillermo del Toro Directed by Guillermo del Toro Starring Charlie Hunnam Idris Elba and Rinko Kikuchi Running time 131 min.

The extinction of mankind has loomed again and again over Hollywood blockbusters the past couple of years though never anywhere near as entertainingly as in ""Pacific Rim. With Mexican genre master Guillermo del Toro (""Pans Labyrinth) at the helm theres no shortage of brains brawn eye candy wit and even some poetry in this epic battle between massive lizard-like monsters and 25-story-high robots operated by humans. Yes its very loud. Several cities are flattened from San Francisco (with special effects vastly superior to those in ""Star Trek Into Darkness) to Hong Kong Tokyo and Sydney. This ultimate geekfest will remind you of at least two dozen earlier movies. And I loved loved every second. Although the monstrous creatures known as Kaiju may resemble distant cousins of Godzilla theyre spawned not by radiation but by conquest-bent intelligent life from another dimension that over a period of years sends forth ever-evolving Kaiju via a portal at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. Raleigh Beckett (Charlie Hunnam) and Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) pair up to the save the world in ""Pacific Rim."" In what amounts to an arms race humans have rolled out ever more sophisticated robots called Jaegers to stop the Kaiju. Each is operated by a pair of rock-star-style warriors who are telepathically linked. The team in the spectacular 18-minute prologue battle royal with a Kaiju are brothers Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam) and Yancy Beckett (Diego Klattenhoff). Only Raleigh survives and after the Jaeger program is officially scrapped as ineffective the bereft young man works as a day laborer in Anchorage on an alternative strategy to save coastal cities from the monsters using giant reinforced walls. Five years later the Jaeger program has gone underground with its leader Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) rebuilding fallen robots to spring into action after the wall strategy predictably fails. Stacker tracks down Raleigh and offers him the chance to co-pilot his old robot Gipsy Danger. The young man agrees to do so if the elder will go along with his choice for co-pilot Japanese beauty Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) who has a not-so-secret connection with Stacker. Del Toro populates his huge steampunk-style sets with one of the best sci-fi ensembles since Michael Bays ""Armageddon even if none of them has a fraction of the star power of Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck. Brit actor Hunnam who bears more than a slight resemblance to Steve McQueen is an appealingly wounded hero and Kikuchi is very good as the enigmatic heroine. They have terrific chemistry both romantic and in a martial-arts demonstration that helps persuade the reluctant Stacker. (Elba best known in this country for his TV work in series like ""The Wire provides appropriate gravitas.) Clifton Collins Jr. is a delight as Stackers bow-tied assistant and Max Martini and Rob Kazinsky add flavor as a macho father-and-son team of Jaeger pilots from Australia. The real scene-stealers -- aside from a very funny extended cameo by del Toros ""Hellboy star Ron Perlman -- are an odd couple of wacky scientists played by Charlie Day and Burn Gorman who endlessly bicker about how to stop the Kaiju. For all the humor and clever twists in the script that Travis Beacham wrote with del Toro a film like this rises or falls on its action sequences and there are some real doozies here as the Jaegers square off again and again against Kaiju who can hurl electricity and deadly acid against them. Director del Toro keeps the fights clean and coherent which (as we saw with ""The Lone Ranger"") is not easy when working on such a gargantuan scale. The whole thing builds to one of the most stunningly eye-popping and exciting climaxes in years. ""Pacific Rim is the very rare movie Id actually recommend seeing in 3-D because it so effectively immerses the viewer in the action. The Kaiju are computer-generated wonders and the Jaegers make the Transformers look like ... well childrens toys. Follow loulumenick on Twitter for the latest movie news and reviews.

Throughout the promotional campaign weve barely seen a human face aside from a brief flash in the trailer of Idris Elba bellowing about the apocalypse. So to turn around and accuse Pacific Rim of being inhuman does feel a little churlish. But its simply impossible to overlook. As the film opens were introduced to skyscraper-sized automaton Gipsy Danger and her pilot Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam) as they battle against the ongoing threat from the kaiju monsters from another dimension who slip through a portal in the depths of the ocean. Raleigh is the tough silent type constantly battling his boss the gloriously named Stacker Pentecost (Elba) - also the tough silent type. As is his protege Mako (Rinko Kikuchi). And his trusted Aussie sidekick (Max Martini). Indeed the only characters who arent tough and silent are a pair of irritating mismatched science geeks one apparently channelling Dr Strangelove (Burn Gorman) the other JJ Abrams (Charlie Day). The action set-pieces are superb thunderous rain-soaked and beautifully detailed - you can almost feel the rust and the slime. Theyre also a tad repetitive. By the climax were starting to feel like weve been punished enough. But if Del Toro is pitching for an audience of 12-year-old boys (and we do mean boys this is old-school macho) hes done a bang-up job. Still there are times when Pacific Rim could be the work of any jobbing Hollywood director - the warmth and idiosyncracy that characterises Del Toros finest work from Pans Labyrinth to Hellboy 2 is absent. The Avengers proved that a slightly left-of-centre director like Joss Whedon could find a home in the heart of Hollywood without losing the personal touch. With Pacific Rim Del Toro doesnt even seem to be trying.

PRACIFIC RIM is perfect if youre an 8-year-old boy; anyone else might find it a bit tedious. If youre not an 8-year-old boy youre certainly going to wonder about the logic as the plot has holes you could drive a robot through. The monsters are dinosaurs basically - why are they so impossible to destroy? And why does anyone think building a very high coastal wall will keep out things that can fly? Duh But whats shocking about Pacific Rim is that director del Toro whos given us visionary worlds in Pans Labyrinth is so unimaginative here. Everythings borrowed the monsters are from Godzilla the robots...cmon. Theyre Walkers from THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK with added radiation. ""Rim"" would never pretend to be subtle and gleefully deals in stereotypes - Australians are brash British people uptight scientsits geeky and bespectacled (no - really?). The competent cast seem to have read the script and decided to turn their performances all the way up to 11 except for Idris Elba who turns his up to about 17. Hes a great actor but if you want to see him acting watch MANDELA. Here hes shouty posturing and wooden. Admittedly he has the very worst dialogue (""One never touch me again. Two never touch me again"" and ""The Apocalypse is cancelled""). Rinko Kikuchi as apparently the only woman left in the future apart from a few newsreaders is the only person who gives her character subtlety and sensitivity. The best you could say of ""Rim"" is that its gleefully bad and it doesnt take itself too seriously. But its preposterous as anonymous as its noisy. Given that the titles a gift to any self-respecting porn director I wonder what the inevitable porn version will be like? No actually I dont want to go there...

Of course its even worse to find out that you were right as you watch something you thought likely to be nonsense. Sometimes its a ""pleasant surprise of otherwise"" - a sort of definition I have just created but it describes an experience I have so rarely encountered with films that it seems even more authentic and unique because of being totally unexpected. Im not a movie critic but reviewing films and things written by others about films is a part of my job. Im a creative writer. The amount of stuff I have watched and read while writing for movie sites like Viewster.com is impressive - in terms of quantity of course not quality. The fact that its my job doesnt make many moments less disappointing at all. Im almost allergic to the words ""blockbuster"" ""apocalyptic epic"" ""thriller"" ""slasher""  ""highest grossing movie"" and I wont mention the words that usually come to my mind as synonyms of those - for the sake of not using bad language. I really hoped Id manage to avoid watching Pacific Rim but my friends insisted that I should try. It turned out to be so different from what I had expected. No-brainer? Cliche? Poor story and ending? Perhaps. I was just fascinated by the scenes introducing the ""drift"" - a condition essential for the two co-pilots to effectively function as one while operating the giant Jaeger machine. It involves synchronizing and virtually living through each others experiences and memories and I find it such a good reflection of human relationships that I dont care for the context where I discovered such a delight. Others may say the story is nonsense and the dialogue is nonsense but telling something through images and scenes rather than words and storylines is the real art of cinema. It feels like the lost magic I thought Id never experience again in the world ruled by special effects that mostly have absolutely failed to impress me. Robots and monsters were certainly the least expected companions for it but thank you guys for luring me out from the attic of old movies.

Get real. This film sets out to simply be a brain in neutral sound and vision experience as David Bowie would say. Its unashamedly constructed like a PS3 or X-Box game which appeals to the younger (much younger) male members of the audience. And frankly whats the problem we dont have any higher expectations. It is crafted beautifully and borrows from a host of other films right down to the realisically worn authentic appearance of equipment first seen in Star Wars all those years ago. Who cares just go and sit back leave your real world cares outside and let this blast your cobwebs away. I was accompanied by my 11 year old nephew who bit his nails a lot with wide eyes and yes actually cheered (in a quiet style) at one point. The story is nonesence the plot is nonesense the dialogue is nonesence the entertainment value simple and just great fun. See it enjoy it and then throw it away. Waste of time seeing this on your telly get to the cinema (but opt for the 2D).FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 13 2013IanFeaturedOh how we all laughed My first laugh at this film came about ten minutes in and as the cliches came through one by one on a regular basis by half way through quite a few people were laughing at the film rather than with it. It doesnt so much have a plot as a number of cut and pasted cliches and barely hidden copies from other films that join the cgi battle scenes together. It makes Battleship sound like Hamlet in comparison. About half way through I sussed the film out it is a remake of Top Gun. The dead brother is Goose; Mako is Kelly McGilliss character; Elba plays the Tom Skeritt ex pilot and the obnoxious Aussie son is obviously Val Kilmers iceman. If you must watch it disengage you brain and let it flow over you you will enjoy it much more that way.

Mankind responded by creating Jaegers--giant warrior robots piloted by telepathically connected navigators like Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam). He loses his brother (and wheelman) during the clunky narration-heavy prelude to Guillermo del Toros unabashedly cocky sci-fi epic. Fortunately such expository weariness is cast aside once the film fleetly flashes forward to the time when Becket is a disgraced loner the Jaeger program is on its last legs and kaiju extinction of the human race is almost guaranteed. Every monster-movie archetype is here from nerdy scientists (Charlie Day and Burn Gorman) to hard-stare leaders (Idris Elba) with a penchant for 11th-hour inspirational speeches. (Watching the former Stringer Bell bellow about ""canceling the apocalypse"" is one of those great giddy pleasures you didnt know you needed.) The copious battle scenes are what many viewers will want to see and they more than deliver in all their digitally augmented glory Alien behemoths are hurled into buildings an abandoned ship is used as an impromptu cudgel and battles rage in both the skies above and the oceanic depths below. But though everything we see is pure pleasurable comic-book absurdity Del Toro somehow lends a plausible humanity to the proceedings one lacking in most of this summers city-destroying blockbusters. Even the victims on the ground make a palpably personal impression and in the case of Beckets callow copilot Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) are as mythically moving as anything in the mecha anime like Neon Genesis Evangelion that the director emulates with expert aplomb.

His Pacific Rim is summer entertainment with a pulse. The effects are so overscaled and lavish as to be occasionally mindless. But then the deep-sea monsters that populate the movie -- scaly nubbly pissed-off behemoths called by their Japanese name kaiju -- are also motivated by something primal a drive that cant be readily explained. Their summer job is a simple glamorous one Qualifications include being able to breathe electric blue fire or open several of their false mouths before revealing the really treacherous maw. What reason for existing do they need other than to lure us to the theater? For del Toro the creature is the feature. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Giant robots matter to him too but less so. And unlike recent extravagant listless robotsploitation exercises like Iron Man 3 Pacific Rim is big and dumb in a smart way. The movies brief voiceover prologue accompanied by a montage of destruction explains it all In 2015 one disgruntled kaiju after another rose from the ocean to come ashore smashing cities like San Francisco Manila and Cabo until it was discovered that the big bruisers could be defeated by giant manned robots known as Jaegers. Phew ""Jaeger pilots became rock stars; kaiju became toys"" the opening monologist explains until the kaiju regained their mojo and came back stronger than before.The voice belongs to Charlie Hunnams Raleigh Becket a former Jaeger pilot whose fellow-pilot brother died in battle as he watched. Actually ""as he watched"" is an understatement Jaeger pilots work in teams connected by a neural bridge -- their minds hold hands figuratively speaking a connection that allows them from within their robot fortress to defeat the kaiju. But after his brothers death Becket cant fight anymore. He drifts until hes lured back into commission by a surly official determined to kick those damn kaiju back to whatever hellhole they came from -- hes played by Idris Elba and he has the most kickass name of all time Stacker Pentecost even though hes mostly referred to as plain old ""marshal."" The pilot who will share the cockpit with Jaegermeister Becket is a rookie with an ax to grind Mako (Rinko Kikuchi) wants revenge against the kaiju and a little red shoe holds the key to her past trauma -- because in a Guillermo del Toro movie childhood always means war even if its just the inner-space kind.Film Details Pacific Rim RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time131 More Info Trailer Everything you think is going to happen in Pacific Rim eventually happens. One character or another chokes at the moment of truth; noble warriors sacrifice for the cause. But del Toro shapes the movie so its not just one booming attack after another Theres breathing space amid the action and in a gorgeously choreographed sequence a bout of old-fashioned hand-to-hand human-to-human combat becomes its own special effect. Elsewhere when the pilots strap themselves into their skyscraper-size robot machines both their bravery and their vulnerability come to the fore. Their success or defeat depends on how literally they translate the line the Replacements Paul Westerberg once sang ""You be me for a while and Ill be you.""Touches like that elevate Pacific Rim above your typical noisy summer bonecrusher extravaganza. The material written by Travis Beacham and del Toro for the express purpose of making a really big movie is blessedly non-elitist. Anybody who goes to see Pacific Rim can be an instant Jaeger-vs.-kaiju expert without having absorbed the entire DC and Marvel libraries by Vulcan mind meld beforehand. Ron Perlman the star of del Toros two crazily poetic Hellboy films even makes a cameo.In other words Pacific Rim is just the kind of big-ticket sci-fi adventure youd want del Toro to make -- provided youd want him to make one at all. In early 2011 The New Yorker ran a half-rousing half-despairing profile of del Toro touching upon his inability to get projects off the ground but also suggesting that he just might be inching closer toward making his dream movie an adaptation of H.P. Lovecrafts novella At the Mountains of Madness. The fact that a visionary director like del Toro is crafting movies like Pacific Rim means theres hope for blockbusters; its also depressing as hell. Is this what the multiheaded love-kaiju of Lovecraft James Whale Edgar Allan Poe and Alfred Hitchcock should be making?No. But still well take it. Because the battle sequences in Pacific Rim while suitably braggadocious are also brushed with the right amount of cartoon majesty. Ive never been totally sure about the expression ""Ill box your ears"" but Im pretty sure thats what a Jaeger does to a kaiju here using a couple of shipping containers. Its so dumbly brilliant you cant believe youre seeing it. And while the Jaegers are cool enough sleek metal giants that look toward the future even as they hold Robby the Robot close to their hearts its the kaiju -- angry destructive ready for an eon-long time-out -- that flourish onscreen. Some have the skin of overgrown horny toads; others sport scorpion tails longer than a freight train. An infant kaiju disappoints -- hes not quite the alluring menace he ought to be. Still these are all del Toros children and every mighty footstep is a place marker for the future a promise that hell soon be on to smaller and better things. There will be time to murder and create.See Also Before Pacific Rim The Films of Guillermo del ToroFollow VoiceFilmClub3 Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Stephanie Zacharek Follow szacharek Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Pictures A better-and-smarter-than-average humans-vs.-monsters spectacular. TWITTER Guillermo del Toros paradoxically derivative yet imaginative sci-fi epic is everything that monster movies since the beginning of time might have wished they could be. Monsters mash titans clash and humans are behind the eight ball in Pacific Rim a staggeringly loud action-packed FXtravaganza thats both a numbing and pretty entertaining example of its movie species. Its Godzilla x 10 as thunderously clangy as any Transformers movie and it may or may not have been inspired by the 1990s anime Neon Genesis Evangelion. But it also really moves has an attractive cast to complement the humanity-threatening beasts and in Guillermo del Toro a director with a lively appreciation of genre tropes. Still almost nothing has proven a sure thing at the box office this summer so while massive success internationally looks likely most of all in Asian markets U.S. acceptance will depend partly upon finicky fanboys but most of all upon general audiences who could decide theyve seen it all before. In most ways this paradoxically derivative yet imaginative sci-fi epic is everything every monster movie since the beginning of time might have wished it could be In no way pinched budget-wise its got first-class special effects crafty behemoths that calculate and react to circumstances in non-dumb ways a smart director who injects a sense of fun and surprise whenever he can a fair percentage of characters you dont mind watching and a few decent plot twists. In this genre thats saying something. ANALYSIS What Pacific Rims Fate Means for Legendary and Warner Bros. On the other hand this is a formula in which cinematic niceties take a back seat to certain expectations that can only be met in fully anticipated ways inviting a familiarity that will encounter various degrees of audience fatigue and/or resistance. Some viewers like seeing the same narrative in this case human resourcefulness prevailing over terrifying brute force and its accompanying satisfactions repeated again and again while others will consider the story predictable old hat and unworthy of attention. In fact one of the biggest gimme-a-break aspects of Travis Beacham and del Toros screenplay based on the formers story lies in its bedrock. Its been seven years since the first Kaiju an enormous amphibious dragon rose from beneath the seas Godzilla-style to decimate San Francisco. Mankinds answer to continued attacks has been to build 25-story-high Jaegers fighting metal robots controlled by two pilots positioned inside them. But its been a losing battle so the Jaeger program is being dropped in favor of building giant walls to protect seaside cities from the onslaught. If the international defense coalition here had only seen World War Z theyd know high fortifications just arent going to work. But after so many years and with the knowledge that Kaiju come up from the ocean wouldnt it have made sense to first evacuate obvious coastal targets such as Hong Kong and Sydney which get stomped on during the course of the action here thus forcing the Kaiju to march inland and be exposed? Have Paris Moscow Tehran and Mexico City been assaulted? Nope. That said the initial Kaiju/Jaeger showdown along the Alaska coast during a nocturnal hurricane is a doozy as hotshot pilot Raleigh Beckett (Charlie Hunnam) and his older brother Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff) take on an aggressive beast with a stabbing snout and enormous jaws capable of biting through metal. Then there are two intriguing keys to the set-up Because it takes two to control a Jaeger the minds of the pilots sync up by way of The Drift which opens up a total mental exchange between two brains; furthermore because of the evolving nature of the Kaiju its determined that some sort of rational intelligence is behind the monsters attacks that theres more to them than just random viciousness. The films title only appears onscreen after this 18-minute action prologue has tragically concluded with Yancys death and the disillusioned Raleigh dropping out. Desperation subsequently stirs Jaeger force commander Stacker Pentecost (where did that name come from?) played in strikingly macho fashion by Idris Elba to dredge Raleigh out of anonymity to co-pilot one of the four remaining Jaegers in a last-ditch effort to vindicate the program and save the world from smart dinosaur descendants. Reluctant to share his mind with someone other than his brother Raleigh has a balky recalcitrant manner thats magnified by Hunnams notable resemblance to Steve McQueen who specialized in this sort of attitude. However its only a matter of time and after a stick-fighting martial arts contest hes paired with beautiful Japanese candidate Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi of Babel) who has a secret with Pentecost that must be exorcised before shes cleared to fly. Theres some cliched macho competitiveness worked in involving a father-son Aussie pilot team (Max Martini and Rob Kazinsky) versus Raleigh while the Russian and Chinese Jaeger units get very short shrift. By contrast the two key scientists who are at odds over the source and nature of the Kaiju and how best to deal with them are amusingly brought to life by a manic Charlie Day and an eccentric Burn Gorman whose high-comic oddness positions his character as a theoretical grandson to Dr. Strangelove. Topping off the cast for sheer bravado and wayward weirdness is del Toro regular Ron Perlman as a sort of flashy Dr. Mabuse of the Hong Kong underground. VIDEO Pacific Rim Featurette Goes Inside Guillermo del Toros Torture Machine To kill time between action set pieces del Toro has done an above-average job of avoiding tedium via some flavorsome casting passably interesting plot contrivances and above all by maintaining strong forward momentum. Unlike so many similar crash-bang action spectaculars this one feels lean and muscular rather than bloated or padded; the combat is almost always coherent and dramatically pointed rather than just splashed on the screen for its own sake. The climax has an anatomical yuck factor hitherto withheld by the film while the intriguing scientific underpinnings of the Kaijus origins provide plenty of possibilities for sequels if needed. ""Today we are canceling the apocalypse"" Pentecost confidently declares before the final battle. Perhaps but in the world of global disaster films theres always room for one more.

And then I stopped counting. While hardly a mature intellectual or subtle affair ""Pacific Rim"" is adolescent glee writ large. Guillermo Del Toro and his team promised monsters versus giant robots and boy howdy they delivered. It is one of the better dumbass sci-fi action movies to come down the pike in quite some time. They dont let 14 year-old boys direct multi-million dollar feature films but somehow perhaps through years of Ramtha-like training Guillermo Del Toro has channeled the interests attitudes and fears from that mindset with a clarity that far surpasses contemporaries like Michael Bay. This no doubt has a few cons as nuance is sacrificed on the altar of spectacle from the very first frame. The pros however loudly demonstrably and repetitively overrule with clobbering fury. This is playtime and imagination drawn from a number of different sources and it is when compared to its peer group of extremely high caliber. The set-up a rift deep in the Pacific Ocean exposes a portal to another dimension. (And why the hell not?) Through this portal come giant Godzilla-esque beasts called kaiju. They each get their own call sign because call signs are awesome. They stomp around and kill but are not totally indestructible. The governments of the world join forces to create giant protector robots called Jaegers. The Jaegers all get call signs too because in case you forgot call signs are awesome. The Jaegers however dont operate themselves - they require at least two pilots who need to sync up via a mind-meld called a neural handshake. Oh yeah the neural handshake - formally referred to as the ""drift"" - is just one of the glorious pulpy SF terms in this movie. Jaegers are kept in the Shatterdome the three Chinese pilots fight using something called ""Thundercloud Formation"" and the man in charge of the whole operation is named Stacker Pentecost played with superlative badassery by Idris Elba. The hero of the film however is Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) the best damn pilot weve got. He suffered a defeat when his brother/co-pilot died by his side but ultimately he will be the one entrusted to save mankind. Alas it is in discussing Becket that I must lodge my first and largest criticism of ""Pacific Rim."" The problem I feel is that Charlie Hunnam flat-out stinks. If you squint while hes onscreen you can almost imagine hes Channing Tatum but in my opinion he lacks what old timey producers call ""It."" Hes a charisma black hole and his line readings are to me laughable. His poor performance took me out of the film repeatedly and with extreme prejudice. The rest of the crew however are all top notch. In addition to big boss Elba theres Clifton Collins as Elbas right hand man Tendo Choi Max Martini as fellow pilot Hercules Hansen Ron Perlman as underworld king Hannibal Chau Charlie Day as the squirrely scientist Dr. Newton Geiszler and Burn Gorman (thats the actors real name) as the other twitchy scientist Dr. Hermann Gottlieb (who is English not German for some reason.) The Day-Gorman pair are characters straight out of Japanese animation brilliant psychos at the fringes of all the tough guy action. And how bout that action It is shot cleanly. Well rendered cleanly might be more accurate but the point is you can see whats going on. The fights are enormous silly near-WWE style set pieces with destructive crunches bonks and thwaps. The design is superlative and Del Toro bends over backward to give us fight choreography we havent seen before. Best is when we cut back to the Jaeger cockpit where our two pilots ""in the drift"" are pantomiming the gigantic robots moves. I havent mentioned the only women in the film that gets more than one line of dialogue - Rinko Kikuchi as Mako Mori. Theres some meet-cute business at first then some emotional obstacles she needs to overcome but in time she and Hunnam form a tremendous bond. Heres something fun theres no romance. They look at one another fondly but it is completely chaste - not even a peck on the cheek. Because 14-year-old boys dont know what the hell is going on with girls but they know they want to be around an ass-kicking one that likes them. And I cant reiterate enough - this movie was made by a 14-year-old boy. ""Pacific Rims"" other big win is its style of world building. Theres no exposition shock and awe - just enough on the edges to keep your mind spinning. When the giant kaiju are slain their corpses are too large to fully remove. Shots of cities show how the flow of every day life has built around the bones of these fallen monsters. Its a small touch but representative of the level of care put into what a lesser production would just steamroll through. I really loved the parts of this movie I was supposed to love. There are dull patches some rivalries and drama that kinda feel like stalling for time - but most of these scenes have at least one solid ""oh snap"" line. Nothing tops Idris Elba shouting ""today we are canceling the apocalypse"" but I think you need to go back to ""Henry V"" to find anything better. And now that Ive compared this movie to Shakespeare Im going to go play with my toys.

Also read Beach Reading 10 Books that Need to Become Movies Would that Guillermo del Toro had had the same attitude regarding Pacific Rim"" his new big-budget take on giant robots (here known as ""jaegers"" German for ""hunters"") versus giant monsters (which as any Comic-Con all-access pass-holder can tell you are known in Japanese as ""kaiju""). One guy in one rubber Godzilla suit stepping on a balsa-wood scale model of Tokyo provides lots more thrills than del Toros Monster Armies of the Night. See photos The Cast of Pacific Rim Hits Blue Carpet for U.K. Premiere Part of the films problem is the whole ""of the Night"" thing whenever the jaegers and the kaiju throw down in ""Pacific Rim"" its at night in the pouring rain - unless theyre both at the bottom of the ocean. Whats the point exactly of cutting-edge CG monsters filmed in a way where we can barely see them? Would ""Jurassic Park"" have worked if our glimpses of the dinosaurs had been fleeting at best? These on-screen battles provide a few jolts - one of the films strong points is that it isnt shot and edited in Michael Bay Confuse-o-Vision - but its a jigsaw of random pieces. We get a robo-fist here and a monster face there but none of the satisfying head-to-toe action of say Rodan or Mothra going toe-to-toe with another zipper-backed beast. See video New Pacific Rim Trailer Gives Humanity Two Options Go Big or Go Extinct This isnt merely an issue of nostalgia for old-school monster movies; the 1990s saw a Japanese reboot of the ""Gamera"" series that married the venerable flying fire-breathing turtle with contemporary sensibilities and visual-effects technologies. If a similar updating was del Toros objective he takes a decent stab at it with ""Pacific Rim"" but ultimately falls short. If you thought the characterizations and dialogue here would be any richer than the ones in ""Godzilla vs. the Smog Monster"" or the old ""Ultraman"" series get ready for disappointment. ""Pacific Rim"" posits a world in which kaiju come to Earth from an alternate dimension and humanitys response is to construct robots so huge and elaborate that they require two operators sharing a mental connection known as ""the drift."" Also Read 8 Tell-Tale Signs That a Movie Could Be a Flop The jaeger program is discontinued after Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) loses his brother Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff) in combat leading politicians to shift resources to constructing giant walls around coastal cities to keep the monsters out. (With Mexican filmmaker del Toro at the helm any resemblance between this bone-headed move and real-life U.S. border issues is no doubt intentional.) When the walls fail Raleigh returns to service under his old commander Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) - not making up these names people - and despite Pentecosts resistance its clear that the pilot best suited to be Raleighs new partner is Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) who as a child witnessed the slaughter of her parents at the hands of the kaiju. Also read Pacific Rim Viral Marketing Prepares for Massive Monster Attack No one has ever watched monster movies for the performances but some very talented people are doing some of their worst work here. Hunnam has been a charismatic TV presence from the original ""Queer as Folk"" to ""Undeclared"" to his current gig on ""Sons of Anarchy"" but hes an utterly bland leading man here. Elba works in two modes - muttering and SIGNIFICANT SHOUTING - while Kikuchi so dryly funny in ""The Brothers Bloom"" makes for the weeping-est and mewling-est action heroine ever. No wonder then that the movie is stolen by the comedy relief - Charlie Day (""Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia"") and Burn Gorman (""Torchwood"") as a frick-and-frack pair of kaiju experts and del Toro regular and Hunnams ""Sons of Anarchy"" co-star Ron Perlman as a trafficker in monster parts. Perlmans presence reminds us of how much Hellboy you get to see in del Toros ""Hellboy"" while the other-worldly creatures here are consigned to the shadows. Also Read More of TheWraps Alonso Duraldes Recent Reviews ""Pacific Rim"" offers a few laughs and a few thrills but it feels like a very large platter serving a disappointingly meager meal.

Guillermo del Toros Pacific Rim Smarter Blockbuster or a Different Kind of Dumb? Eric Kohn Jul 8 2013 300 am erickohn Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk Sometime this year extraterrestrial monsters of unfathomable scale called Kaiju emerge from the ocean through an inter-dimensional portal and wreak havoc on civilization. With time humankind comes up with a contingency plan by constructing equally massive Jaeger robots controlled by the mental commands of two pilots as they engage in mechanically-empowered hand-to-hand combat. This premise sets the stage for Guillermo del Toros emphatically loud and cluttered tribute to Japanese monster movies (""Godzilla"" chief among them) as well as the mecha genre of giant machines mainly found in anime and videogames. Take that mission as you will; theres not much more to ""Pacific Rim"" than its principle reference points which Del Toro clashes together with a chaotic fervor on par with the battles at the movies center. Viewers familiar with this sensory assault may assume that any form of plot has been relegated to the sidelines. Instead ""Pacific Rim"" offers loads of it. The transmedia-savvy del Toro has laid the groundwork for entire universe of near future events starting with a prequel comic book written by ""Pacific Rim"" screenwriter Travis Beacham (who shares credit with del Toro on the movies script) and further enhanced by mobile games. The feature itself revolves around a network of characters with a wide variety of backstories and interests all headed toward the common goal of ending Kaiju destruction. Emboldened by Beachmans original concept del Toro jumps right into a realm of silly battles and barking orders on par with the zippiest Saturday morning cartoons but unlike his gloriously eccentric ""Hellboy"" movies -- the directors only other comparable works -- the riotous premise feels oddly souless. The ""human"" drama if it can be described as such involves disgruntled former Jaeger pilot Raleigh Becket (a stone-faced Charlie Hunnam) whose traumatic accident in an introductory Kaiju battle leaves him disoriented and lost until his deflected former boss Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) calls Raleigh back to action for a renegade attempt to resurrect the robot assault after the military shuts down the program. Back in action hes ultimately paired with worshipful start-up pilot Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) whose origin naturally involves Kaijus killing her parents. Theres plenty of strategic talk and grim pronouncements counteracted by inspiring speeches of the ""Independence Day"" variety but the real stars of ""Pacific Rim"" are the set pieces. The robots themselves relatively tame creations by todays CGI standards confront murkily designed monsters their brutal showdowns containing the fiery intensity of a hyperactive child clashing his toys together with unrelenting glee. They have the same puerile attention span Roland Emmerichs ""Godzilla"" took plenty of bullets for clumsily staging most of the set pieces at night an all-too-handy means of obscuring details. ""Pacific Rim"" falls into the same trap. Yet compared to ""Transformers"" standards in which strings of epic battles blend together into a tiresome montage of simulated mayhem each fight in ""Pacific Rim"" has its own unique identity and they grow incrementally more complex -- an early one-on-one at sea looks tame compared to another battle in which both Kaiju and Jaeger careen wildly into the upper echelons of the Earths atmosphere and both set the stage for a climactic face-off at the bottom of the sea. So ""Pacific Rim"" delivers those goods with a serious investment in imbuing the proceedings with visual invention although the stakes essentially involve the same inherently silly conceit repeated ad infinitum. Of course del Toro would surely disagree. The erudite filmmaker has excelled at explaining the roots of ""Pacific Rim"" extending his reference points well beyond old monster movies and invoking Fracisco Goyas ominous painting ""The Colossus"" as a chief influence on the battles epic reach. A visionary working with Hollywood formula rather than purely adhering to it del Toro still cant manage to infuse this story with much in the way of emotion or big ideas. He hasnt smartened up the formula but rather sprinkled it with a few extra dazzling ingredients. Too in love with itself to ever totally go off the rails ""Pacific Rim"" doesnt qualify as the first full-on dud of del Toros career but its hard not to get the sense that somethings missing. By comparison Gareth Edwards 2010 DIY feature ""Monsters"" featured a similar invasion of colossal aliens but deepened the premise by using it to explore post-catastrophe trauma and complicated the very idea of the invaders as legitimate bad guys. ""Pacific Rim"" never bothers to pull apart its juvenile conceits nor does it take any clever stabs at the allegories embedded in its militant proceedings a la Paul Verhoevens ultra-subversive ""Starship Troopers."" Compared to some of the more leaden spectacles this summer ""White House Down"" and the final hour of ""Man of Steel"" chief among them ""Pacific Rim"" has the inventive colorful textures of a fully realized world. But thats only enough to make it a slightly different kind of dumb from the usual messy blockbuster routine. Still del Toro includes some playfully grotesque flourishes to remind us of his ""Mimic"" days. A subplot involving nerdy scientist Newton Geiszler (""Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia""  star Charlie Day) attempting to purchase and study a Kaiju brain on the black market from underground dealmaker Hannibal Chau -- memorably portrayed with cartoonish sleaze by del Toro regular Ron Perlman -- opens the opportunity for a couple of well-earned gross-out moments involving the exploration of gooey alien carcasses. Hinting at a ""Men in Black""-style sci-fi comedy these scenes spring to life with an energy that makes the robot-monster fights look pretty dry by comparison. Too bad they dominate. Del Toro has expressed an interest in using ""Pacific Rim"" to bring the genres it references to the attention of more audiences a questionable form of advocacy that echoes a similarly misconceived attempt to raise awareness for B-movies by Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez with their ""Grindhouse"" omnibus project a few years back. Like that uneven epic ""Pacific Rim"" isnt a gateway drug; its pitched at the addicts. Explaining how the pilot-robot mind meld works one engineers says ""the deeper the bond the better you fight"" an apt summation of the extent to which hardcore fans of Kaiju and mecha films will likely go to mat for the sake of this Godzilla-sized passion project. Everyone else is collateral damage.

Of all the doom-laden fantasies the studios have rolled out this summer ""Pacific Rim"" is the one pushing itself most aggressively as guilt-free entertainment offering up an apocalyptic spectacle in a spirit of unpretentious unapologetic fun. Which it will be at least for those who measure fun primarily in terms of noise chaos and bombast or who can find continual novelty in the sight of giant monsters and robots doing battle for the better part of two hours. Viewers with less of an appetite for nonstop destruction should brace themselves for the squarest clunkiest and certainly loudest movie of director Guillermo del Toros career a crushed-metal orgy that plays like an extended 3D episode of ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" on very expensive acid.This story first appeared in the July 16 2013 issue of Variety.

Although this epic gamble from Warner Bros. has generated considerable anticipation among del Toros fanbase it remains to be seen whether a non-franchise property rooted in the Japanese Kaiju tradition that spawned Godzilla among other legends can generate the sustained B.O. needed to offset a nearly 200 million production budget. International prospects look strong if nothing else especially around the Pacific Rim itself where the pictures numerous Asian elements not least co-lead Rinko Kikuchi can be counted on to have particular appeal. With this gargantuan passion project del Toro means to fashion a giddy throwback to the monster movies of yore and restore a sense of pure escapism to the summer movie landscape an eminently worthy goal for a genre master of such inexhaustible imagination and knowledge of the B-movie canon. Yet while the directors love for his material is at once sincere and self-evident its the sort of devotion that winds up holding all but the most like-minded viewers at an uninvolving remove; although assembled with consummate care and obsessive attention to visual detail ""Pacific Rim"" manages only fitful engagement and little in the way of real wonderment suspense or terror. It may not reside in the same crass soulless neighborhood as Michael Bays ""Transformers"" movies but its sensory-overload aesthetics are at times no more than a junkyard or two away. Del Toro and Travis Beachams script lays out the futuristic premise with a burst of breathless exposition Its 2020 and for years humanity has been at war with the Kaiju -- enormous lizard-like beasts that arise from the ocean floor to wreak havoc on coastal cities (San Francisco Manila and Cabo San Lucas are decimated in a matter of minutes). But the tide turns when the men and women of Earth form the Pan Pacific Defense Corps and begin building Jaegers 25-story-high fighting robots that ward off enough Kaiju attacks to achieve an uneasy stalemate. SEE MORE Pacific Rims Legendary Marketing Challenge In a plot point that will remind some of Japans popular ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" franchise each Jaeger is controlled from within by two humans one to operate each hemisphere of the robots body. Hotshot American brothers Raleigh (Charlie Hunnam) and Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff) make a trusty co-piloting team at least until their Jaeger engages a Kaiju off the coast of Alaska spelling a hasty exit for Yancy while granting audiences their first taste of monster-vs.-robot action. The viewers level of appreciation for this initial bout will likely indicate how much they enjoy the rest of the picture with its wall-to-demolished-wall action. Five years later a still-scarred Raleigh gets a shot at redemption from well-named PPDC commander Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) who wants him to take charge of his old Jaeger Gipsy Danger as the humans prepare to make one last stand against the ever more powerful and dangerous Kaiju. Heading to a massively fortified version of Hong Kong Raleigh finds an ideal Gipsy co-pilot in Pentecosts demure but formidable young protege Mako Mori (Kikuchi) whose appointment sets off literal and figurative sparks. The storys most intriguing angle is the trippy process by which two fighters power a Jaeger requiring them to enter into a unique state of mental and bodily fusion called ""the Drift."" That Raleigh and Mako must share each others thoughts feelings and memories is a conceit that would seem to raise any number of tantalizing dramatic possibilities and there is one memorable flashback to Makos childhood -- an episode that in evoking the atomic horrors that spawned the Godzilla legend briefly recalls the nightmarish fairy-tale intensity of del Toros 2006 masterwork ""Pans Labyrinth."" SEE MORE Inside Pacific Rim with Guillermo del Toro In all other respects the script is content to skim the surface. The psychological effects of the Drift are not dramatized but assumed the progression of the story not developed so much as programmed. (""I cant have anyone else in my head again"" Raleigh says a curious complaint from a hero about whom we know almost nothing by films end.) Del Toros trademark humor does emerge in an overlong subplot involving Dr. Newton Geiszler (an overamped Charlie Day) a hysteric-prone scientist attempting to figure out the monsters master plan and Hannibal Chau (an obligatory appearance by del Toro fixture Ron Perlman) a pimped-out black-market dealer in Kaiju body parts. Here and there ""Pacific Rim"" reveals hints of a potentially rich but underdeveloped science-fiction mythology full of satirical and speculative touches that are ultimately overwhelmed by the fight sequences that represent the films raison detre. Overkill is not just the goal but a governing artistic principle and del Toro takes it on such faith that nothing could be more compelling than his monsters-and-robots mash-ups that he spends almost no time easing us into the fray. The pacing is mechanical even bludgeoning in its single-mindedness. Buildings topple and bridges collapse; the mid-ocean battles are so ferocious that mankind would surely be wiped out by the resulting tidal waves if not the monsters themselves. Yet such is the blithe upbeat spirit of the whole enterprise (""Today we are canceling the apocalypse"" is the films signature rouse-the-troops line) that nothing in these gladiator-style faceoffs feels at stake except perhaps the viewers desire to see a Jaeger swing an aircraft carrier like a 2x4. One of the pictures persistent problems is that its man-meets-machine conceit never really comes to life resulting in a strange disconnect between these metal marionettes and the humans at the controls; aside from a few impressive payoffs as when Makos ingenious maneuvering saves the day the overall experience is not unlike that of watching someone play a highly elaborate videogame. The whooshing cinematography by Guillermo Navarro (lensing his first picture in digital) and the rapid-fire editing by John Gilroy and Peter Amundson conspire to create a metronomic visual rhythm with little sense of mounting excitement an effect unaltered by the films post-production 3D conversion (it will also be released in stereoscopic Imax). SEE MORE Kanye Wests Praise for Pacific Rim Ignites Buzz As conceived by a small army of concept artists sculptors and designers and seamlessly animated by a larger army of ILM visual-effects artists the combatants are arresting enough to behold when you can see them clearly -- particularly the Kaiju some of which are equipped with sharp appendages capable of impaling their opponents and/or squirting bioluminescent venom. Enhancing this glow-in-the-dark effect almost all the major setpieces unfold at night against futuristic cityscapes brushed with vibrant neon hues. Rounding out the fine if underused ensemble are Clifton Collins Jr. and Burn Gorman as gifted eccentric members of the Kaiju-fighting initiative and Max Martini and Rob Kazinsky as an Australian father-son pilot duo who add some dramatic tension to the mix. (In the spirit of international cooperation Chinese and Russian Jaeger teams also make token appearances.) Hunnam reps a blandly serviceable lead but Kikuchi manages to render her characters shrinking-violet reserve as intriguing as her sudden displays of physical prowess. Too often the actors including the terrific Elba are forced to bellow over Ramin Djawadis omnipresent score likely to be ringing in viewers heads as they stagger toward the exits.

Reply Rica says July 28 2013 at 715 pm Another reviewer who like when Star Wars was released felt that movie was a cheesy space opera with robots and blasters...reviewer.get a life and have some fun I saw the movie and indeed liked it a lot You work for Variety...put some variety in your reviews....not all movies are made to be Oscar winners. Relax and enjoy the eye candy and popcorn for a change And dont be stressed about your deadlines. Reply Phillip M. Dampier (phillipdampier) says July 19 2013 at 247 pm The problem here is that people are being asked to pay 10 to watch an extended length video game pounding across the screen. A deep plot creative writing character depth... who needs those when you can lard two hours of cartoonish CGI across the screen with a deafening soundtrack. Its more like a ride at an amusement park than a movie. If that is what people want this is that. Movie candy. The demographic target is plain enough 98 percent of the audience was under 30 and male. Reply Robert Morgan says July 15 2013 at 757 am The reviewer needs to let go and have some fun. I loved Godzilla Ultraman and all those Japanese movies. Dude its fun they are not trying to save the world or make you think let yourself go and enjoy the ride. Reply Greg says July 12 2013 at 1010 pm If you ever grew up watching and idolizing after school cartoons like Robotech Macross Transformers Gobots Voltron or G-Force you are going to love this movie. Del Toro stays true to the greatness of those cartoons with their action technology plot and drama and magnifies them on an exponential level. Im guessing this reviewer grew up in a different generation and didnt feel the same excitement I did seeing my childhood brought to the movie screen. Reply Jay says July 12 2013 at 320 pm Justin Chang gives Pacific Rim best unintentional endorsement this year (""power rangers on acid"" - YEAH) His review isnt entirely negative ""offering up... unapologetic fun..."" Hes obviously in the critics minority but still acknowledges where the film succeeds. Most reviews lean positive eg http//www.albany.com/movie-blog/ . It IS unpretentious unapologetic fun Reply angel says July 12 2013 at 310 am Saw the movie last night. I disagree with this writers review. The movie was great. Yes there was a couple of cheesy scenes but they really werent bad. The fight scenes were great. By the end of the movie I was on the edge of my sit. If this movie doesnt atleast win a movie award for visual effects I will be really disappointed. I recommend going to see Its worth a trip to the movie theater. Reply angel says July 12 2013 at 316 am seat Reply Star (heroinepose) says July 11 2013 at 529 pm I dont know about anyone else but I would definitely see ""an extended 3D episode of ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" on very expensive acid"" like at least 50 times ... if you were trying to get me not to see this film you failed in an incredible way Mr. Chang. Reply Justin Chang says July 13 2013 at 1217 am On the contrary I hope you see the film and enjoy it. Thanks for your feedback. Reply DaveGinOly says July 10 2013 at 1112 am I have to question a review when the reviewer very apparently wasnt paying attention to the movie. Even the trailer makes it plain that an ""aircraft carrier"" is not used ""like a 2x4"" as stated in the review - it appears to be a small tanker or freighter a commercial not a military ship and a far cry from an aircraft carrier. If the reviewer missed this very obvious fact what else escaped him about the movie? Reply leenstl says July 10 2013 at 550 pm Did you actually read the review? He wrote ""...the viewers desire to see a Jaeger swing an aircraft carrier like a 2x4 ..."" he never wrote anything about what he did or didnt see being used as a 2X4. He was pointing out that the audience might want to see that they will have to build their own Jaegers to see that of course. Reply le0nx says July 10 2013 at 1042 am Compare this movie with Power Ranger It is like comparing ALF with E.T. This review is a EPIC FAIL. Reply Sue Johnson says July 10 2013 at 917 am I have to wonder if this critic has really ever truly watched any of the old Japanese films about Godzilla. They are campy and less concerned with plot characters and storyline. It is all about the fighting...fighting...fighting. Guillermo del Toro has said that his inspiration has come more from a painting and less from monster movies; although there does appear to be some inspiration from old monster vs. monster movies. And I understand that there is a video game in the works I am looking forward to viewing the film...just for its campiness Reply Old Man Johnson says July 10 2013 at 627 am ""Viewers with less of an appetite for nonstop destruction should brace themselves for the squarest clunkiest and certainly loudest movie of director Guillermo del Toros career a crushed-metal orgy that plays like an extended 3D episode of ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" on very expensive acid."" I realize the author Justin Chang intended this statement to be negative but he just made me want to go see it This should be on the back of the DVD packaging when it gets distributed. Given the studios reliance on social media for marketing definitely a non-traditional approach I have to wonder how accurate these doom and gloom ticket sales predictions will be. Bought my tickets online and Im ready to go. Thanks Justin Chang Reply zeekca says July 10 2013 at 326 am My favorite part of this article is when he pretends he knows anything about Evangelion and then says something patently untrue. Despicable what passes for writing in Variety in 2013. Reply jiohn says July 9 2013 at 418 pm ....See ..This Mov.ie online at T H E A T E R 1 5 . C 0 M. Reply Joao Amaral says July 9 2013 at 227 pm I dont know how ""extended 3D episode of ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" on very expensive acid."" is a bad thing Reply R. Shane Bingham (TheNerdsmith) says July 9 2013 at 743 pm Right? I now want to see it more than ever Reply vPuik says July 9 2013 at 102 pm There is always a Lifetime channel if that is more up your alley. Reply Freddie says July 9 2013 at 1056 am You had me at power rangers Reply mxv says July 9 2013 at 1048 am Sorry but if you wouldnt watch ""an extended 3D episode of ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" on very expensive acid"" you dont like fun. Reply James Hayes-Barber (JamesHayBar) says July 9 2013 at 1021 am Id like to also point out the ignorant and incredibly offensive comments a Variety Writer has made about Del Toro and the Mexican Nation on Twitter. DrewAtHitFix worth pondering is his studious avoidance of his country amp; his determination to be a star of intl corporate entertainments. -- Robert Koehler (bhkoe) July 2 2013 Reply James Hayes-Barber (JamesHayBar) says July 9 2013 at 1025 am Apologies for the double post but the way Variety parsed Twitter links you cant see the entire conversation Reply Rusty Shackleford says July 9 2013 at 1002 am Put on your tin foils hats here folks heres my pet theory Warner is going to have meetings with legendary something about negotiating their commercial relationship and contracts. Legendary put a lot of money on this film so the entire future of the studio is on the table. If flops legendary will take heavy losses and warner will have the upper hand on the negotiations so they can buy the studio for peanuts. So probably warner is trying to move his influences to bash pacific rim in order to get said advantage hence variety MUST talk shit about pacific rim. Just food for thought. Reply Scoop says July 8 2013 at 1110 pm Power Rangers on acid? How the fck is that a bad thing? Reply carsonJEFFRIES says July 9 2013 at 933 am Uhhh... right?  ? This ""negative"" review makes me want to see it even MORE Power Rangers-esque mega-budget monster movie on acid? Sign me up I miss the old monster movies of yore... at least it isnt a remake of a reboot of a.... yeah.. You get the drift. Good job del Toro Reply Tony the WonderHorse says July 8 2013 at 848 pm Wow you really have it in for this film. Apparently selling it as the next Battleship is a coordinated effort no one else reviews the film so poorly. Did del Toro run over your dog or something? Reply RMW says July 8 2013 at 837 pm ""...where the pictures numerous Asian elements not least co-lead Rinko Kikuchi can be counted on to have particular appeal."" Ironically it seems Rinko is not popular back in Japan http//kotaku.com/5968393/after-starring-in-pacific-rim-will-japan-finally-adore-rinko-kikuchi All the best for this film though. Reply Star (heroinepose) says July 11 2013 at 536 pm Rinko is unpopular in Japan because she takes on ""unappealing"" sorts of roles not because she lacks skill or talent. She was wonderful in Liar Game (a personal favourite of mine) but very distinctly not a very likeable character a role for which actresses in Japan sometimes suffer. She was also simply incredible in Babel but the nudity seemed ""unsavory"" to a great deal of the films Japanese audience and that doomed her (unfairly) as well. Japanese audiences (particularly the very vocal Internet-dwelling community of them) tend to judge an actress (and even an actor sometimes though less so) based on the kinds of roles they take on and how easily/naturally it seems to come to them on-screen. Reply anon says July 8 2013 at 710 pm gt;In a plot point that will remind some of Japans popular ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" franchise each Jaeger is controlled from within by two humans But thats wrong. The only time the Evas are controlled by 2 pilots was in Rebuild 3.0 and the pilots arent even synchronised Shinji just did his own thing. Reply LOL says July 8 2013 at 620 pm Sorry but Mighty Morphin Power Rangers its a Sentai this movie its a Kaiju. Do your homework Reply mad says July 8 2013 at 617 pm Why North Americans are so ignorants? Impossible to the appreciating this cause they dont know nothing than Transborings and Emongelion. Reply Jay says July 12 2013 at 305 pm Guillermo del Toro IS North American and anime and associated art froms are very popular here. If the film isnt successful it has more to do with marketing and brand awareness. (look at transformers and power rangers to understand how popular the style can be - and they arent even done very well.) Reply TrustKnow1 says July 8 2013 at 603 pm Sorry but Ill be skipping this one. Not because of anything else except the 3-D My one and only exposure to this process left my depth perception screwed up for a week. Too bad... Reply DM says July 11 2013 at 348 pm Eva might be deeply deeply silly and melodramatic but (at least with the original I havent seen the big money remakes) at least its actually a clearly personal quirky surprising and deeply felt work even if it is a bit awful. Whereas it seems to be impossible for even a good director like Del Torro to do personal challenging or adventurous work within teen/genre work in Hollywood at the moment. I mean EVA actually has sympathetic characters doing genuinely awful things episodes set entirely inside the main characters head genuine dramatic conflict between the principals as well as external conflict with the bad guys thats more than perfunctory etc. Reply Priss says July 10 2013 at 922 pm Thats why you dont watch movies like these in 3D. Shit even del Toro said once ""Dont watch it in 3D please"" Its only because the studios are retardedly crazy over 3D these days that PacRim is also in 3D. Reply Lady Kaede says July 8 2013 at 425 pm Ok you are clearly just not looking for the same kind of primal thrill I expect - what part of ""an extended 3D episode of ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" on very expensive acid"" sounds bad to you? Reply Artxuleta says July 8 2013 at 107 pm Popcorn flick I can live with that. Reply Justin says July 8 2013 at 1114 am The review just compared PACIFIC RIM to Godzilla Power Rangers Evangelion and even Pans Labyrinth. Someone tell me how this is a BAD review? Seriously sounds like the BEST review to me Reply Johnnie says July 8 2013 at 1037 am So if the critic likes the movie hes a good critic. If he doesnt like the movie hes a bad critic. Is that it? Reply Star (heroinepose) says July 11 2013 at 539 pm No; when the critic fails to have any understanding of the film he watched at all and tries (and fails) to draw parallels to a well-established series which he also seems to have no understanding of hes a poor critic ... and a poor writer. Reply Frederick Louis Richardson says July 8 2013 at 1018 am Human(s) occupy a robotic ergonomic suit -- the essential robot -- and do justice to evildoers. Sounds like Iron Man...and look how well that movie did at the box office its sequels and the characters leadership in The Avengers. Robots are the next big thing (after vampires werewolves and zombies). Really its all nostalgia...another way of say ""Were out of ideas so to hell with originality; its Iron Man v. Godzilla."" Reply Whynheiser says July 8 2013 at 1029 am Except Iron Man never invented robots or mechanical suits and giant robots and giant monsters ( and them fighting each other) has been around for decades. Classic anime from the 70s and 80s are known worldwide in non english speaking countries due to international dubbing and localization. As for the author it really has nothing to do with Evangelion. Its like saying how Superman is like Mary Poppins because they both help people. Reply squid says July 9 2013 at 728 am ""Except Iron Man never invented robots or mechanical suits"" Someone didnt see Iron Man III. Matt Pniewski says July 8 2013 at 1011 am Not that I dont think the reviewer has a right to his opinion but I dont follow the ""Evangelion"" comparison. Sure there are comparisons to be made between this and other existing material but to bring up Evangelion and then talk about something that is well not part of Evangelion is quite frankly very odd to me. Reply Kamille Bidan says July 8 2013 at 953 am you said it was like evangelion you literally destroyed your entire argument and invalidated every opinion you were going to state in the 3rd paragraph. Its good to know that no one on earth other than hardcore nerds know anything about giant robots. Reply Sam says July 8 2013 at 827 am LOL how dare anyone not like a robot vs monster movie Also LMAO if Hunnam is supposed to be the next big thing thanx to this movie when he lacks the charisma to be a leading man nor can he can he get his accent right. After SOA ends go tend to the animals on your ranch and fade into obscurity. Hollywood has enough shit actors we dont need more. Reply Frank Caruso says July 8 2013 at 647 am It simply looks like Japanese monsters got bigger which means more destruction with roc-em-sock robots and creatures that could kick Godzillas Butt Probably would have made a better animated feature its obvious they really did not need any live performances. Reply Rafael Rivera-Perez says July 8 2013 at 555 am When The Power Rangers storyline and CGI has a wide audience approach I will compare this movie PR with the Power Rangers. This comment is a lack of respect of what GDT is trying to do here. He brought old moster-robot nostalgia and he delivered. But what can you expect from this critic who normally has his head stuck on his butt LOL Reply therealeverton says July 8 2013 at 804 am He does indeed Reply SteveL says July 8 2013 at 345 am Just unlucky for Pacific Rim to get this reviewer Chang rarely gives positive reviews to big movies. Check out Hollywood Reporter for ex-Variety reviewer and much better critic Todd McCarthys review he enjoyed the movie. Reply David Penasco Maldonado says July 8 2013 at 251 am So Pacific Rim is a crap. What a surprise coming of one of the most overrated hacks working on Hollywood today Guillermo del Toro is fortunate that Thomas Tull has financed his expensive toy because this is going to sink at the box office. Reply ccdev says July 8 2013 at 246 am whatever...i just wanna elbow-rocket this reviewer in his face Reply JBH says July 8 2013 at 159 am ""Viewers with less of an appetite for nonstop destruction should brace themselves for the squarest clunkiest and certainly loudest movie of director Guillermo del Toros career a crushed-metal orgy that plays like an extended 3D episode of ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" on very expensive acid."" I know the critic was trying to all critical here but this makes me want to see the movie even more. They should put this on the back of the DVD as one of the blurbs. Reply mike says July 8 2013 at 1032 am ha I had a very similar thought when reading that myself Reply Jo Bannntine says July 8 2013 at 149 am Am I the only one who thinks the majority of film critics today have forgotten that summer movies are primarily designed to entertain mass audiences? I really think they have. Its very rare to find a critics actually enjoy something these days.I guess my only question is; what were you expecting The Hours? Oh and opinions are just that - opinions. You know theyre a lot like assholes. Everybody has one. Reply Sergio says July 8 2013 at 136 am Just one question - how much ""they"" paid you to kill the hype around the movie? It really looks strange that Variety create all-negative articles while its evident that film isnt bad at all. Reply Ross (necrometer) says July 8 2013 at 130 am You guys really seem to have it in for this movie especially after the nonsensical story about the poor tracking vs. Grown Ups 2. Evidence to the contrary http//screencrush.com/pacific-rim-grown-ups-2-poll/ Reply Matt Bacon says July 8 2013 at 1021 am Thats not evidence at all. The average movie going public wants a light family comedy over a drama about monsters fighting machines. Of course the online film blog poll will have a bias towards Pacific Rim. Do you know at all how tracking works? Its not some online poll on Screenrant... Reply Johnnie says July 8 2013 at 1019 am Why is it ""evident"" the film isnt bad? Reply Sorry what? says July 8 2013 at 102 am Justin Chang your thesourus is stuck in overdrive... I think youve lost touch on how to get your point across with out trying to appear like an oxford lecturer.... the last person who talked like you write died of pomposity 20 years ago. Ill stick to rotten tomatos thanks. Reply Betty says July 8 2013 at 1238 am I saw the trailor for this movie I would watch it loads of actionehat I saw it was looking good Reply David says July 8 2013 at 1219 am Some keen insights but you missed the depth of Hunnams performance.
