Chu transformed the ""Step Up"" franchise into the gold standard for modern dance movies ""Battle of the Year 3D"" is a runner-up at best. Shepherded to the screen by Benson Lee the writer-director of the acclaimed documentary ""Planet B-Boy"" the film exudes authenticity in its depiction of the annual dance competition -- most notably in acknowledging Americas poor standing within the competitive community. But its dramatization of a U.S. dream teams journey to the international showcase is leaden with predictable character types and a seemingly inexhaustible wealth of storytelling cliches neither of which its well-executed but oddly infrequent dance sequences are able to overcome. Josh Holloway (TVs ""Lost"") plays Jason Blake a former basketball coach enlisted by longtime pal and mogul Dante Graham (Laz Alonso) to whip a team of dancers into shape for the Battle of the Year. Despite his burgeoning alcoholism and a few personal reservations -- ""I aint that guy any more"" he grunts -- Blake agrees recruiting Grahams sharp-witted dance-obsessed intern Franklyn (Josh Peck) as an assistant. Ditching Grahams group of complacent show-offs to assemble his team of the best American dancers from across the country Blake begins the arduous process of molding a group of individual stars into a cohesive unit. But as dancers like Rooster (Chris Brown) and Do Knock (Jon Cruz) compete for the spotlight Blake finds his skills as a coach tested even as Graham begins to exert pressure on him to deliver a team that can bring home top honors at the competition. Also read 5 Breakout Movie Stars of Fall While previous dance films have mined similar territory to one another narratively speaking for their tales of adversity personal expression competition and achievement ""Battle of the Year 3D"" feels like a compendium of every possible storyline audiences have ever seen. Holloways coach hopes to redeem himself and repair the hole torn in his life by personal tragedy. Pecks intern is desperate for recognition and later validation. Browns dancer is talented and cocky but in desperate need of some humility. Another dancer pins his aspirations to help his family escape poverty on winning the competition. And so on and so on. In fact the only remotely new development in the film is the introduction of an openly gay dancer whose general determination to earn respect from his teammates is hardly novel but whose presence at least acknowledges a marginalized group within the b-boy community for the first time on film. Lees camerawork is effective particularly during the dance sequences where he manages to create a consistent and comprehensible geography for the choreography. But he lacks the inventiveness of Chu or ""Step Up Revolution"" director Scott Speer -- most conspicuously in terms of utilizing 3D -- and chronicles the groups behavior off the dance floor with a perfunctory and uninspiring flatness. Also read Chris Brown Slapped With Lawsuit Over Frank Ocean Brawl (Exclusive) Given the fact that Lee adapted his own documentary into a fictional film it seems reasonable to expect that ""Battle of the Year"" would possess the same sort of fluidity and intimacy as its predecessor. But the filmmaker seems hamstrung by the beats of a boilerplate underdog story that his actors cannot elevate and he only manages to inject it with subversive twists in the final act which serves as a last-minute distraction from the rest of the films utter conventionality. Amusingly Lee himself seems to be aware that his fictional debut is inferior to the documentary that inspired it During an early scene two characters talk unironically at length about how amazing ""Planet B-Boy"" is. Or perhaps hes simply aware that he borrowed the wrong elements -- or just not enough of the right ones -- from his earlier film focusing on the personal foibles and petty squabbles of his cliched characters rather than their awe-inspiring acrobatic feats. But in chronicling a competition that Lee clearly knows no one is simply going to let you take the lead Lee aimed for modesty over spectacle and most critically platitudes over power moves. All of which is why ""Battle of the Year 3D"" effectively does for dance movies what Grahams team did before Blake took over as coach -- namely serve as a placeholder for something better.

(Matt Kennedy) D+ Battle of the Year Genre Musical; Starring Laz Alonso Josh Holloway Josh Peck; Director Benson Lee; Release Date Wide 09/20/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 109; Distributor Sony Pictures Releasing Posted September 30 2013 -- 1200 AM EDT At various points throughout his astoundingly cliched breakdancing flick Battle of the Year director Benson Lee has his on-the-outs alcoholic coach (Josh Holloway) gather inspiration by watching Lees own 2007 documentary Planet B-Boy. For his part Lee seems to have pored over every sports underdog movie of the last twenty years boiled away all the interesting particulars and kept whatever dross was left. From the moment the films ""Dream Team"" of b-boys begin preparing for the titular international dance competition its all on cruise control Predictable scenes of in-fighting lead to predictable scenes of reconciliation and Holloway spends the entire movie either delivering locker-room speeches so saccharine they would kill a diabetic or staring soulfully at the flask of 80-proof character flaw that he carries with him at all times. The actual dancing scenes are occasionally electrifying if far too sparse but other than that and the welcome sight of co-star Chris Brown getting clocked in the face the film barely gets off the ground much less sticks the landing.

I dont recall whether this comes before or after said character refers to the Sony tablet hes wielding as ""the future"" but either way its an act of ego so brazen as to be borderline endearing which goes double for the films overall appropriation of nearly every single underdog sports cliche that comes to mind. For the uninitiated b-boying is essentially breakdancing and ""Battle"" is essentially any other competition movie imaginable. Hip-hop mogul Dante (Laz Alonso) wants to bring the Battle of the Year title back to the States after fifteen years of international embarrassment and so he enlists the reluctant help of old b-buddy/former basketball coach/current grief stubble model Jason (a sulking Josh Holloway) and his own fanboy assistant Franklyn ""with a y"" (a smirking Josh Peck) to shape up Team U.S.A. in time for the worldwide competition in France. Can Jason ditch his drinking problem tied to an emotional trauma involving his family? Will the hot-headed teammates (including Chris Brown) squash their respective girl-minded beefs and homophobic tendencies? Does anyone even refer to the team choreographer and lone female (Caity Lotz) by her actual name before the end credits? WILL ANYONE SPELL FRANKLYNS NAME RIGHT ON THE FIRST TRY? Sure its the second time in the past year that weve seen Peck and friends pitted against a South Korean enemy and okay a climactic routine involving blindfolded dancers is admittedly inspired. It also happens to be the one time that Lees restless cutting rhythms do the performers any favors. At least a third of the remainder consists of split-screen training montages with each crowding the frame in an effort to make the 3D element seem busier if not more immersive. The ensuing competition sequences more often fall prey to the quick cuts of the recent ""Step Up Revolution"" when compared to the remarkably fluid moves showcased in ""Step Up 3D"" before that. On top of that the whole creaky package is tied together by an exhausting amount of Sony product placement. (Distributor Screen Gems happens to be a subsidiary.) One defeated dancer hangs his head in shame during a locker room speech as old as time but he happens to do so just within frame of his buddys brand new Walkman which came with a similarly shiny PS Vita when Dante decided that the crew could use a few new toys for their transatlantic trip. As someone who enjoyed last years ""Pitch Perfect"" despite its blatantly formulaic trappings though I cannot entirely resent ""Battle of the Year"" for sticking to the same old steps. It should satisfy the planet of b-boys and girls to whom it thoroughly preaches the tenets of talent and teamwork while amusing anyone else who simply cant ignore the promise of an all-corn buffet.

He hires a cliche for the job by which I mean a washed-up basketball coach-turned-alcoholic Jason Blake (Josh Holloway a.k.a. Sawyer on TVs Lost). Blake assisted by his fan-boy assistant Franklyn (Josh Peck) selects a national team of stars boards them in a former juvenile detention centre and subjects them to boot camp-style training.After some tiresome interpersonal squabbles inspirational speeches (apparently theres no ""I"" in the word ""team"") the boys fly to France where voila the dancing begins.The 3-D is a pain and the excitable editing slo-mo and speeded-up action frustrate attempts to watch the athleticism on display but the last half-hour takes it up a notch The world champion South Korean crew for example dives and leaps like a bucket of Super Balls in a space capsule. And the U.S. team snaps between meticulous synchronized movements and explosive combinations of individual contortions.Even if youve never harboured any b-ambitions you may find your head spinning.

Credit Elohim Carrau/Screen Gems The miracle of the new 3-D dance film ""Battle of the Year"" is how it can be so relentlessly boring while there is so much frenetic activity on screen. Despite the break-dance spins and disorienting strobe lights in the performance scenes the movie feels sluggish throughout.It cannot be revived by the bombastic music -- more appropriate for a space or military epic -- that underscores every dramatic scene. The most successful sections are training montages in which three frames of different scenes float across the screen at once. Because you cannot focus on any one thing your eyes are tricked into the illusion of information conveyed as in flipping channels.Despite having names like Sniper Lil Adonis and Mayhem virtually none of the characters are memorable. Perhaps this is appropriate in a film in which the American dance team members are taught by their coach (Josh Holloway) not to use the word ""I."" Instead they are instructed to use the royal ""we.""The only one who stands out is played by Chris Brown (more known for his music and a history of domestic abuse than for his acting). Blond and brooding as Rooster Mr. Brown plays an arrogant insolent young man engaged in an inane Twitter war with another dancer. With his constant dull scowl he is very successful at playing unlikable.Josh Peck is seemingly miscast as the comic relief in his role as the assistant coach. Instead he brings a welcome sweetness to this film about unpleasant people who move around a lot. But Mr. Pecks hoarse sensitive whisper is used to say lines about how Jews like him are ""stripped of our swag at the circumcision."" He also responds ""Seriously?"" to endless slights in his role as the stereotypical nebbish.""Battle of the Year"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for language and some rude behavior.

Dante (Laz Alonso) may be the deep-pocketed African-American sponsor but if he wants to win the titular break-dance Olympics hell have to enlist his white bestie Jason Blake (Josh Holloway) to coach presumably because Tinseltown insisted. So begins an Aryan schooling of a box-checkingly diverse dream team consisting of the Asian one the gay one and the volatile wisecracking misogynist played by a Methody Chris Brown. That the players bosss boss is black but still sidelined marks Battle of the Years feeble attempt to mask hayseed Blake as the lily-white (and goofily incongruous) hero of the piece. Even more transparent is the movies covert jingoism which surfaces when Team USA hits France for the global tournament and is unconvincingly mocked while still hogging screen time. (A transcendent blindfolded routine about America-as-melting-pot cant fix matters.) The raison detre of popping-and-locking scenes is trumped by tired team-building bathos whose flagrancy is anything but conducive to spreading the films hug-it-out bro-love. Follow R.

Coach Derrek (Josh Holloway in gray sweatshirt) tries to assemble a winning break-dance team for an international competition in ""Battle of the Year."" Photo Matt Kennedy Screen Gems Battle of the Year review battling dancers 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Battle of the Year Sports drama. Starring Josh Holloway Josh Peck Caity Lotz and Chris Brown. Directed by Benson Lee. (PG-13. 109 minutes.) Since the death of disco led to the Age of Irony in 1979 the ridiculous has often met the sublime in film. ""Road House"" star Patrick Swayze built a career finding these kinds of roles. But there may be no more surefire equation in cinema than ridiculous + sublime + dance battles. ""Battle of the Year"" is an enjoyable movie not because of any special gifts by the filmmakers or emotional resonance in the script. It was more like destiny. Once someone jotted down the concept on a cocktail napkin and hired B-Boys who could actually dance the movie pretty much had to turn out OK. The story is a derivative quilt patching together cliches from every sports movie since 1976. ""Lost"" heartthrob Josh Holloway is likeably scruffy as Derrek an alcoholic coach looking for one more chance molding a rag-tag dance squad to challenge a superpower (the Koreans) at an international break-dancing competition. Coach Derreks frequent nips from his flask would make a lively drinking game - every time Holloway drinks you drink - if it wouldnt result in your death. The crew of break-dancing B-Boys are presented even more simply; each can be defined by exactly one character trait. (The short hothead the taller hothead the gay guy the guy who doesnt like the gay guy ...) It all seems simple but there were still several ways director Benson Lee could have screwed this up -- Filming the dance sequences with quick edits and/or in slow motion. -- Adding a serious love interest. (Which coupled with the drinking would have essentially made this a ""Leaving Las Vegas"" remake.) -- Leaving the lens cap on the camera throughout the 30-plus day production. Lee triumphs over all of these challenges wisely focusing his energies on frequent well-choreographed dance-offs. His biggest sin is relentlessly plugging his excellent earlier documentary ""Planet B-Boy"" the real-life events of which provide a very loose template for the film. (Imagine if the Tom Hanks character in Steven Spielbergs ""The Terminal"" spent large chunks of the movie watching ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" at the airport sports bar.) Theres also an earnest positivity throughout ""Battle of the Year."" With minimal violence and no sex despite the PG-13 rating this is basically ""The Mighty Ducks"" with a lot more profanity. Are there better movies in the theater this weekend? Definitely. Is there a better piece of harmless escapist entertainment? Do the math.

"Review Weve seen these Battle of the Year steps before - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Weve seen these Battle of the Year steps before Chris Brown Elohim Carrau / Screen Gems Steve Terada left Chris Brown and Anis Cherufa star in ""Battle of the Year."" Steve Terada left Chris Brown and Anis Cherufa star in ""Battle of the Year."" (Elohim Carrau / Screen Gems) Annlee Ellingson ""Battle of the Year"" isnt so much inspired by director Benson Lees 2007 break-dancing documentary ""Planet B-Boy"" as it is an ad for it. Not only is the previous well-regarded film referred to by name -- ""Youve seen Planet B-Boy right?"" -- but footage from it is used intermittently throughout. Add in overt product placement from Sony Puma and Braun -- star Josh Holloway actually ""shaves"" his considerable stubble with an electric razor -- and this 3-D spectacle is less the dance movie thats going to make b-boying cool again than a shill for sponsors gear.Holloway plays Jason ""Wonder Bread"" Blake a one-time b-boy were told (although thats not remotely believable) and champion basketball coach recruited to assemble an American dream team to take to the titular tournament in Montpellier France. His biggest challenge is getting his ego-driven dancers like goofball Rooster (singer Chris Brown) and assiduous Do Knock (real-life b-boy Jonathan ""Do Knock"" Cruz) to perform as a team. Thus ""Battle"" eschews the Romeo-and-Juliet romance of other dance movies for the structure of an inspiring sports flick. PHOTOS Movie Sneaks 2013Still its no less formulaic with cliche-ridden dialogue and a predictable plot offering the flimsiest framework on which to hang the dance scenes feats of incredible athleticism and artistry -- a philosophic contrast worthy of much more discussion than the perfunctory Magic Johnson metaphor that Blake tenders. -------------------------""Battle of the Year""MPAA rating PG-13 for language and some rude behaviorRunning time 1 hour 49 minutes Playing In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Dance Reviews Sony Corp.

Movie Review Battle of the Year 2 Stars. B-boy B movie. Running time 109 minutes. Rated PG-13 (language). At the Kips Bay the Loews Orpheum others. Ill admit my favorite part of this movie was watching a young man yell ""Why are you such an a - - hole?"" at Chris Brown at close range. But there are also a handful of moments to enjoy if youre a break dance fan -- or a Brown fan as many in my audience seemed to be. ""Battle of the Year"" wont win any awards for plot originality. And I really couldnt tell you too much about the first half-hour as this 3-D movie was initially projected wrong. From what I could gather Josh Holloways former basketball coach Jason is pulled from grief-stricken early retirement by his friend Dante (Laz Alonso) who sponsors a b-boy team he hopes to send to the worlds biggest competition Frances Battle of the Year. And he thinks Jason -- a surly alcoholic -- is just the man to make it happen. Benson Lee is the director of the well-received 2007 documentary ""Planet B-Boy"" and his direction here reflects his knowledge and love of the art form. Unfortunately hes hamstrung by this tired screenplay with its motley band of misfits learning to function as a team under a coach whos working out his own personal demons. The icing on that cake is Brown as Rooster the most obnoxious recruit in the b-boy ""dream team"" Jasons assembling. I cant imagine it was too much of a stretch for the singer and domestic abuser to play an arrogant narcissistic jerk but I will give him props Hes an excellent dancer and has a star quality that keeps you watching (or hate-watching) him. A friendlier face is Josh Peck as Holloways assistant Franklyn. Peck charmed as a stoner in 2008s ""The Wackness"" but has remained largely under the radar since. He doesnt have too much to do here other than be self-deprecating and stand around on the sidelines but he does it quite likably. The rest of the cast was clearly recruited for their dance skills and not their acting chops which is as it should be. The film suffers when theyre called upon to emote -- one well-intentioned story line has a gay b-boy and a homophobic one learning to understand one another stiffly -- but the footwork is first-rate. Too many training montages and inspirational coach speeches later we reach the Battle of the Year which is where Lees direction briefly shines. His footage of the other teams in competition -- particularly the crowd favorite Korea -- is electric and the US teams performance is equally tight. At the risk of sounding 100 I think its regrettable this film had to be shot in digital 3-D. Both those formats actually do a frustrating disservice to the depiction of the action making it look choppier more flickery and occasionally blurrier than it would otherwise. (Theres a 2-D version you can see which might help.) Me I guess Ill Netflix 1984s ""Breakin 2"" and reminisce about the less headachy old days.

Unfortunately thats as real as Battle is gonna keep it.By way of hurried exposition we learn that ""b-boying"" the dance that cross-pollinates a hyperactive Olympic gymnastics floor exercise with rap music is dying in the U.S. You know your movie is in trouble if it concedes that Americans became bored with your subject matter decades ago.To bring the ""b-boy"" crown back to the land that spawned the dance urban fashion mogul Dante Graham (Laz Alonso) decides to form a Dream Team of dancers to compete for the world title in France.Theyll be led by one of our favorite Hollywood cliches the drunk unemployed high school coach this time in the form of Jason Blake (Josh Holloway). Jason once danced though youd never guess it here and was a great basketball coach before gin and a family tragedy got the best of him. So why wouldnt he know how to teach urban kids how to cut a rug?Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Battle of the Year is a film about an American break dance team that competes in a tournament against the best dancers in the world. VPCHe doesnt which may explain why it takes more than 45 minutes to get to any detailed dance scenes and nearly an hour to real competition.The dancers are fine led by Chris Brown who plays Rooster a kid with sharp moves and a sharper mouth.But director Benson Lee can never get any liftoff from Battles astonishingly lazy script. Holloway in particular is miscast as the films Great Inspiration. He looks like hed qualify for a refund from the Arthur Miller Dance School and is fond of saying that there is no ""i"" in team before banning his b-boys from using it -- and uttering it himself minutes later.Hes right There is no ""i"" in team. But there are a few in imbecilic.REVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersWorse the film is an unabashed advertisement for itself. Battle makes numerous references to a real dance film it calls groundbreaking Planet B-Boy Bensons 2007 documentary. Distributor Sony has its actors hawk the companys electronic games and tablets. And Braun razor ads are everywhere for some reason (isnt this one demographic that wouldnt need an electric shaver?).Somewhere writers may have had the kernel of a real story. Battle dances over a few Glee-inspired moments such as the gay dancer and Mideast military vet.But theres nothing coordinated about Battle nor anything that stops it from stepping on its own toes. 8 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1eVWUHkFall Movies Calendar SeptemberTake a look at the films heading to the box office this September.

Photo Credit MCT advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A hard-luck basketball coach is tapped to lead a breakdancing crew to greatness. Rated PG-13 BOTTOM LINE This teen-targeted mix of ""Hoosiers"" and ""Bring It On"" stumbles with too many heartfelt speeches and not nearly enough dancing. CAST Josh Holloway Chris Brown Do Knock Laz Alonso LENGTH 149 Its a time-tested idea the kinetic action of an urban dance-off movie bolstered by the underdog narrative of a sports movie. The latest example ""Battle of the Year"" might have been a winner if its creators hadnt made two fatal errors. One is a surfeit of inspirational pep-talks and put-me-in-coach cliches. The other is a dearth of dancing. ""Battle of the Year"" is named after the real breakdancing competition that takes place annually in of all places France. The films director Benson Lee documented that international event in his 2007 film ""Planet B-Boy"" but for the fictional ""Battle of the Year"" he wants a familiar Hollywood-ready story. Enter Jason Blake (Josh Holloway ""Lost"") a former basketball coach with a dead family and a drinking problem. His old schoolmate Dante (Laz Alonso) now a Diddyesque entertainment mogul taps Blake to whip a crew of talented but egotistical breakdancers into shape.

Structurally its a disaster with characters who flicker in and out of the story almost at random. Chris Brown is energetic as the strutting Rooster Josh Peck lightens the mood as assistant coach Franklyn and the real breakdancers Do Knock and Rebel have natural charm. The movie also deserves credit for introducing a gay B-boy Lil Adonis (Richard Maguire) who confronts homophobia within the crew. Mostly though the team members are interchangeable and unmemorable. Where ""Battle"" truly stumbles is in its dancing sequences. There arent enough of them and most are abbreviated rehearsals. As a mix of two genres ""Battle of the Year"" might have worked. After all sports movies are never really about the sport. The problem is that dance-off movies are always -- always -- about the dancing.

"Battle of the Year 1.5 stars Article Things to do >> Movies >> Article Battle of the Year 1.5 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED INFO Battle of the Year Bomb to bad 1.5 stars Director Benson Lee.Cast Josh Holloway Laz Alonso Josh Peck.Rating PG-13 for language and some rude behavior. By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Sep 19 2013 943 AM If you can get past the mountain of cliches and poor acting and hackneyed story lines and the fact that someone let Chris Brown be in a movie ""Battle of the Year"" is actually ... still pretty awful. Director Benson Lees film is based on his well-received 2007 documentary ""Planet B-Boy"" which chronicled the comeback of sorts of break dancing. He should have quit while he was ahead. Screenwriters Brin Hill and Chris Parker have come up with an absurd story that revolves around the Battle of the Year (an international B-boying competition that in the movie at least the U.S. hasnt won in 15 years). Because break dancing was invented in the U.S. this is considered an outrage by Dante Graham (Laz Alonso) former B-boy turned mogul. Because its an insult to national pride? Please. Because it is affecting Dantes bottom line which depends on B-boy culture to make a profit. If interest declines so does business. So Dante turns to his old pal Jason Blake (Josh Holloway) a sort of hillbilly B-boy back in the day who became a successful basketball coach but a tragedy has left him a miserable drunk. Dante remembers the old Blake however sees the real man beneath the booze and hires him to get the U.S. team back on track. Blakes idea is to dump the current crew and cherry-pick a kind of B-boy dream team. He hires the somewhat hapless Franklyn (""with a Y"") as his assistant in case one more avenue of obvious plot development might escape us. The dream team is a good idea in theory but in practice its tricky because of all the egos involved. Chief among them is Rooster (Brown) who must put his individual goals aside for the betterment of blah blah blah. If on the off chance you dont know where this is leading Blake is always there with a groan-worthy bromide to remind you. They practice for weeks inside an abandoned juvenile-detention center because thats how Blake does things. Barbed wire and everything though hes still guzzling from his ever-present flask. Franklyn suggests hiring a choreographer so Stacy (Caity Lotz) comes on board issues a few dont-flirt-with-me warnings to the team and pretty much disappears. The Battle of the Year takes place in France with 20 teams competing. The Korean team is the defending champion and considered miles above the rest of the competition. But the American dream team first must make it to the final four. Someone notes somewhere along the line that everyone hates Americans (who knew?) and an incident the night before the competition cements this animosity. Can this ragtag bunch stand against the best in the world? Can they bond as a team sacrificing the good of the one for the good of the whole? Dude if you even need to think about this youre putting way more effort into it than the filmmakers did. On the plus side Brown really is a good dancer as is the rest of the cast. There are some stunning moves lovingly filmed. Other than that well. ... Holloway suffers the most as he is given the burden of delivering line after terrible line with a straight face as he whips his team into shape rah-rah. Everyone loved him in ""Lost"" but here he comes off like a poor mans Matthew McConaughey. Dirt poor. But who are we kidding? This is a bad idea turned into a bad movie and no one involved seems particularly interested in changing that. The dancing may be worthy of a dream team but the script is more of a scary dream.

Ostensibly concerned with reviving the art of b-boying ""Battle of the Year"" proves far more effective as a feature-length testament to the wisdom of theater-hopping. Though it climaxes with a good quarter-hour of mind-boggling break moves that effortlessly deny the laws of both physics and anatomy Benson Lees dance pic is so fatally frontloaded with endless training montages awfully written indifferently acted drama sports-film platitudes and jaw-dropping product placements that only the hardiest of viewers will make it through to the payoff. With the presence of Chris Brown promising to attract and repel audiences in equal measure modest box office beckons.This story first appeared in the September 24 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. Taking place in an unacknowledged parallel universe where b-boying has emerged as the dominant one of hip-hops four elements (with rapping as invisible as graffiti writing DJing and b-girling) ""Battle of the Year"" opens with a board meeting hosted by the Russell Simmons-like entrepreneur Dante Graham (Laz Alonso). A former breaker himself Dante is determined to finance a top-level team for the international Battle of the Year (BOTY) b-boy tournament in Montpellier whose importance is likened to nearly every major athletic competition save the Rugby World Cup. Hoping to end a long dry spell for the Americans -- who seem almost as likely to win the Rugby World Cup at this point -- Dante recruits former dancer-turned-basketball coach-turned dissolute drunk and widower Jason Blake (Josh Holloway) to assemble a dream team of dancers and serve as coach. Eventually culling more than a dozen ethnically diverse hotshots for his squad (played by a cadre of b-boys alongside wildly popular/reviled Ramp;B star Brown) Blake hunkers the group down in an abandoned juvenile hall with three months to whip them into shape. During the rare moments when they arent training in split-screen montages the assembled dancers engage in tough-guy spats sit through motivational speeches cribbed from a dozen sub-""Remember the Titans"" sports dramas and endure reality-show-like weekly eliminations. Aided by a nebbishy assistant coach (Josh Peck providing the only intentional laughs to be had) Blake eventually hires a foxy choreographer (Caity Lotz) who makes a splashy entrance and spends the rest of the film supplying reaction shots. To catch up with the international explosion of b-boying (BOTY is a Germany-founded France-hosted competition dominated by South Koreans) Blake consults ""Planet B-Boy"" an excellent 2008 documentary exploration of the tournament. Clips from that docu appear frequently throughout the film always with a bug denoting its title in the corner a la local news broadcasts and its referred to by one character as a ""dope documentary ... with like a billion hits on Netflix."" Its worth mentioning that ""Planet B-Boy"" was also directed by Lee who puzzlingly gives his old pic an ""inspired by"" credit on his new one. Yet these squicky salvos of self-promotion dont even register as the films most eyebrow-raising advertorial indulgences. Blatant product placement onscreen has grown so prevalent as to be largely unnoticeable and pics like ""The Internship"" have further blurred the lines between fully integrated branded entertainment and traditional cinema. Yet even within this context ""Battle of the Years"" shilling is remarkable. Perhaps the loving odes to Puma sneakers are understandable coming from dancers as is their excitement to receive gift bags full of Sony devices. (Even if no one outside a marketing department has likely ever uttered the phrase ""This is the new Sony tablet -- its the future"") Yet when this same enthusiasm is applied to Brauns new line of electric shaving products a certain Rubicon of shamelessness has been crossed. As one high-school-aged viewer at the screening attended was heard to remark after a particularly obnoxious plug ""This is some bullshit."" Aside from that the filmmakers have recruited a wonderful array of dancers here all of whom are more than deserving of such a mainstream showcase. Brown proves a serviceable actor and a generally excellent dancer although his lack of lifelong b-boy credentials occasionally marks him as the sore thumb among all the ringers. (Predictably the script contrives to exclude him from the more demanding routines.) The pics centerpiece dance sequence with which our hardy Yank heroes dazzle a hostile foreign crowd straight out of ""Rocky IV"" is a magnificent piece of choreography juggling Olympic-level aerial gymnastics with a savvy theme tracing the evolution of American dance music from swing to hip-hop. A frenzied final battle between the Americans and the cocky Koreans is similarly filled with awe-inspiring freezes flips and flares yet the filmmakers attempt to gild the lily by recruiting cable TV personalities Terrence J and Sway Calloway to scream inane mile-a-minute voiceover commentary throughout proves distracting. The 3D camerawork is fantastic during the dance scenes and functional everywhere else and the sound design is noticeably sophisticated. Pilar McCurrys soundtrack is perhaps lighter on traditional hip-hop than one might expect though any music supervisor smart enough to unearth Digital Undergrounds ""Same Song"" deserves a nod of recognition.

"Battle of the Year wraps great dancing in a weak movie review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesBattle of the Year wraps great dancing in a weak movie reviewBattle of the Year based on Benson Lees documentary Planet B-Boy features impressive moves but not much substance.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Sept. 19 2013Battle of the YearStarring Josh Holloway Laz Alonso Josh Peck Caity Lotz and Chris Brown. Directed by Benson Lee. 109 minutes. Opening Sept. 20 at major theatres. PG.Theres not much story to Battle of the Year but the athletic b-boy dancing (actually more gymnastics with attitude) is visually entertaining and bad-boy Chris Brown gets punched in the face so its not a total wash.Directed by Benson Lee Battle of the Year is a fictionalized film version of his 2007 documentary Planet B-Boy (including an onscreen product placement) a transition which is hardly helped by a tortuously bad script penned by Brin Hill and Chris Parker (Vampire in Brooklyn).Article Continued BelowThe action kicks off as Los Angeles hip-hop merchandise mogul Dante (Avatars Laz Alonso) frets that b-boying (formerly known as break dancing for all you old schoolers) isnt cool anymore among the young customers he relies on to keep his empire afloat.Blame the power of offshore industries; the Americans are getting their red white and blue butts handed to them by superior more disciplined dance crews from Russia Korea France and Germany at the annual Battle of the Year dance competition in France. Dante figures his pal hard-drinking broken man and onetime basketball coach Jason Blake (Losts Josh Holloway in the role usually reserved for Gerard Butler) can whip the faltering crew into shape.But Blake has a better idea audition the best b-boys from across the country to create an all-American Dream Team. If this was a 1940s musical this would be the point where someone would pipe up ""My dads got a barn Lets put on a show""Hes aided by likable second-in-command Franklyn (Josh Peck of The Wackness) a Jewish wanna-be dancer who archly explains ""my people were not exactly chosen to be b-boys.""The dancers some played with varying degrees of success by real b-boys (Do Knock Flipz) work on their moves while Blake goes all Rocky on them. He picks off a member a week to send home to winnow down the crew with stoic reminders that there is no ""I"" in team.Enter a pretty choreographer (Caity Lotz) several montages jittery camera effects and some split screens and youve got yourself a movie.With a vow to bring the dance battle trophy to the U.S. ""where it all started"" hanging in the air the crew heads to France to repeat the plot of every Step Up movie plus a couple of 1960s Elvis flicks. ""Lets bring this trophy back for America"" mumbles Brown who plays strutting wise-ass b-boy Rooster.Sent to invade France with a warning from Blake not to behave like ""ugly Americans"" the crew does just that. But theyve got some dancing to do and the final battles against international adversaries are impressive in their execution even if the uneven dark and jittery 3D camerawork does them no favours. Fancy footwork is a fine thing but how about a little movie with that posing crew?The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsPrince William and Kate coming back to Canada this fallRoyals are scheduled to come to British Columbia and the Yukon but no word on whether they will bring their children.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it The dance scenes in ""Battle of the Year"" have swagger but when the scrappy team of dancers leave the stage the movie drags. (Screen Gems) By Sean OConnell September 19 2013 Everything about Benson Lees predictable dance flick ""Battle of the Year"" strikes me as old. Not classic and not obsolete -- just off the mark by a few years as if Lee intended to capitalize on the relevancy of his cast and subject matter but ended up being too late to the game. Start with Josh Holloway cast in ""Battle"" as a down-on-his-luck coach hired to train a team of arrogant dancers for an international competition. Holloways hit show ""Lost"" left the airwaves in 2010 and he hasnt done much since. ""Battle"" also tries to get audiences to root for Chris Brown by tapping him to play a cocky dancer called Rooster in Holloways band of breakdancing competitors. But the 24-year-old singer-dancer has been persona non grata in the public eye since the 2009 domestic violence charges that were filed following an assault on then-girlfriend Rihanna. Lee is attempting to keep a spotlight shining on b-boy culture an aggressive style of street dancing that consists of body-contorting twists flips leaps spins and poses set to hip-hop music. Lee showcased this next level of competitive breakdancing in his award-winning 2008 documentary ""Planet B-Boy"" and a feature film building on that awareness makes complete sense . . . just not five years later when the fad appears to have faded. What saves ""Battle"" from complete irrelevancy is the undisputable fact that a scrappy underdog formula tends to work no matter what time period or sport. Here its competitive dance where the best of the best train for the annual Battle of the Year held in Montpellier France. Tired of watching innovative Korean German and French squads excel at a dance style the Americans invented entrepreneur Dante Graham (Laz Alonso) hires Jason Blake (Holloway) to motivate and train a b-boy ""Dream Team"" for the upcoming competition. At that point Graham actually makes a comparison to the 1992 Olympic mens basketball squad that featured Michael Jordan Magic Johnson and Charles Barkley -- yet another outdated reference in a screenplay overflowing with them. When Lee stages a dance sequence ""Battle"" actually has swagger. The director understands how to shoot b-boy dancing so that the choreographed moves arent lost in a flurry of choppy edits. Lee also fills his young ensemble with legitimate dancers guys like Ivan ""Flipz"" Velez and Jon ""Do Knock"" Cruz. And Brown for all of his real-world problems is a spectacular dance talent who has legitimate screen presence. But the dialogue bridging the energetic dance scenes consists almost entirely of hollow coach speak. The films course is woefully apparent and we barely get to know the individuals on Blakes Dream Team so we dont get invested in their success or failure. And in todays culture when such competitive dance programs as ""So You Think You Can Dance?"" and ""Dancing With the Stars"" clog network television schedules why would you pay good money and wade through tired cliches to watch on the big screen what you can get at home for free?

Share Tweet Too incompetent to work as an underdog dance flick but not nearly weird enough to qualify as howling camp Battle Of The Year is destined to please only bad movie buffs desperate for a fix of awful dialogue blatant product placement and clunky exposition. However pure badness is an acquired taste; viewers who dont find lines like ""I went to a concert and I overheard some high-school kids saying that B-boying is no longer cool"" inherently funny should probably stay away. Josh Holloway stars as a former high-school basketball coach who is hired to whip an elite breakdancing team into shape in time for the titular competition. Holloway is an alcoholic who ""lost his wife and son in a horrible car accident"" and now spends his days staring at himself angrily in the mirror while taking swigs from a flask. (Holloways alcoholism has no effect on the plot and is never resolved.) Holloway prepares for this by watching Benson Lees previous film the documentary Planet B-Boy over and over. If nothing else Battle Of The Year will teach the audience the following about Planet B-Boy Apparently its the most important movie ever made about breakdancing its really popular and its on Netflix Instant right now. In fact viewers can even use a Sony Xperia tablet to watch it (After Holloway watches Planet B-Boy on Netflix Instant on a TV controlled by a Sony tablet the TV displays the films DVD menu thereby confirming Lee values putting the title of his previous movie into one more scene over basic competence.) Crammed with promoters and sponsors the movie feels like a nightclub handbill blown up to feature length. E News Terrence J. and MTV News Sway Calloway both get opening-credits billing for cameos as themselves and are identified with on-screen text as ""Terrence J E"" and ""Sway Calloway MTV"" every time they appear. Braun--real-life sponsor of the Battle Of The Year competition--is praised in the dialogue early on and has its logo in nearly every shot of the climax. In terms of cross-promotional shamelessness the movie stops just short of having the characters meet Benson Lee famous director of the acclaimed documentary masterpiece Planet B-Boy. Some of this would be forgivable if Battle Of The Year had halfway-decent breakdancing sequences. However with the exception of one brief moment--a rehearsal of the teams entrance presented in a single take--its dance scenes are lackluster; most are shot using a tight shutter angle which results in a stuttery look familiar from countless 00s action films that works much better in 2-D than in 3-D. Lees editing and choice of angles turn the dance routines into disorganized collections of jerks; his decision to focus on Holloways team means that their opponents--including the feared Korean team--never seem impressive which robs the movie of any sense of stakes. Considering the fact that Battle Of The Years cast includes many real-life talented breakdancers capable of executing routines in full the films choppy climax amounts to a massively squandered opportunity.

Area theaters. In 3-D where available. B-boys become B-men under the tutelage of Josh Holloway -- known to TV viewers as Sawyer from ""Lost"" -- in the latest 3-D dance competition movie ""Battle of the Year."" Will the top performers from various street crews put aside their beefs work together as a team and bring the top prize of hip-hop culture back to American where it belongs? With only three months to train before the titular battle in France a ticking clocks throbbing bass puts this by-the-numbers -- yet admittedly entertaining -- movie through its moves. Holloway is Jason the widower-drunk looking to coach his way back into society. Josh Peck (""The Wackness"" Nickelodeons ""Drake amp; Josh"") is his comic-relief doofus assistant Franklyn and Laz Alonso is the Diddy-ish sponsor providing the cash and high-end swag. Front and center however are the dancers a rainbow coalition of black brown Asian gay and Jewish young men. A handful of them get a thumbnail back story. Break dancing in Battle of the Year Much focus is given to the tough braggart Rooster played with reasonable believability by convicted felon Chris Brown. True to form Browns character picks a fight with someone smaller than he is. The singer and sometime actor (""Think Like a Man"" ""Takers"") isnt very good in the film but he isnt bad either. He dances well and cries on cue. In fact ""Battle of the Year"" never free-styles past a cliche it doesnt like. Dialogue-wise ""Theres no I in Team "" ""Flip the script"" and ""Putting in blood sweat and tears"" all take a turn. And the play-by-play from MTVs Sway doesnt do much to explain the competitions complex points system. But its undeniable that the good-natured ""Afterschool Special"" vibe here plays to the films corny strengths and the dancing is impressive. So much so that its almost impossible not to cheer during the final round.

The U.S. invented it but now the Koreans Russians Germans and Japanese a veritable goon squad of 20th-century villains have taken over and the French-- the French-- sponsor the biggest international dance-off the Battle of the Year. Merde Have they forgotten we saved their asses on the Maginot Soul Train Line? Over a militaristic soundtrack of snare drums and mournful horns urban-wear impresario Dante Graham (Laz Alonso) warns that America is losing its honor--and that he wont be able to sell as many shoes. Time for Hollywoods favorite hero an alcoholic basketball coach (Josh Holloway) to save the day by forming a B-boy Dream Team from a posse of flexible street kids. His second-in-command a Jewish breakdancing-scholar (Josh Peck) who sighs that he lost his swagger when he was circumcised. Brin Hill and Chris Parkers script is as original as Puff Daddy during his rapping-over-Sting phase. Are there speeches? Holloway is literally forced to say ""There is no I in team."" Its even structured like a reality show as Coach whittles the gang from 36 to 22 to 13 handing the klutzy a bus pass home like a Bachelorette doling out roses. To save time it simply name-checks athletes we already know explaining away the bad blood between Rooster (Chris Brown) and Do Knock (Jon ""Do Knock"" Cruz) as a ""Kobe-and-Shaq thing."" Alas director Benson Lee lacks the florid visual style of Step Up 3D which remains the Citizen Kane of the genre--this is strictly a concrete-and-barbed-wire crotch-grabbing back-flips exertion. But the dorky jingoistic charm wins points even if just for daring to dress the team in red white and blue Kangols while the judges scream ""Korea strikes back with an aerial assault"" DirectorBenson Lee CastJosh Holloway Laz Alonso Josh Peck Caity Lotz Chris Brown WritersBrin Hill Chris Parker ProducersBeau Flynn Tripp Vinson Amy Lo DistributorSony Pictures Watch the Trailer (c)2016 LA Weekly LP.
