But the big difference between Christopher Reeves trad hero and this latest lazy drunken member of the caped fraternity is that Hancock was never a Samaritan in the first place. He looks like a tramp he kips on benches and he leaves behind him a trail of destruction wherever he tries to lend a hand. He doesnt even own a cape. Hes a selfish layabout in need of some old-fashioned movie redemption. Which is exactly what we get. Oddly it takes a suburban PR executive called Ray - played with charm by Jason Bateman - to correct Hancocks behaviour even if Rays wife Mary (Charlize Theron) is strangely wary of their friendship. As Ray gets to work on Hancocks image the film offers some humour and Smith as ever is fairly charismatic. For the first half theres a laidback knowing vibe to the script and Smith has some fun with the whole bizarre idea while director Peter Berg swings his camera about as he did for The Kingdom. Its a very modern conceit that behind every successful man lies an even better publicist. And its no coincidence that Hollywood with its reliance on a well-oiled PR machine has come up with a fictional publicist whos more angel than svengali. But then the rest of the film - after an hour - flops spectacularly. The big problem is that the script tries to have its cake and eat it first ribbing us with nods and winks emanating from this sideways view of a superhero and then abandoning this detachment in favour of a traditional comic-book showdown that feels out of place rushed and squeezed into the films remaining minutes. Put simply the filmmakers bottle it. Hancocks reinvention as a good guy coincides with the emergence of a super-criminal played by Brit actor Eddie Marsan who in the facial hair department looks like hes stepped off the set of Happy-Go-Lucky. Hes a lame villain. Theres an unexpected twist that throws some weird distracting logic into the mix followed by a crisis a fight a spurt of apocalyptic digital larks - and its over. The film bows out not as a wink-wink pastiche but as a straightforward superhero movie - and a bad one at that.

Hes brave. Hes certainly bad tempered. He is Hancock If you watch this film you will be hooked from start to finish. You will sit on edge wondering what is going to happen next. My first impression of Hancock (Will Smith) was that he is an evil person however I start to notice that he only wants to save the world. This film is packed with exitement entertainment and extaordinary action Hancock is alone and has got nobody until he meets a man name Rey (Jason Bateman). He understands what Hancock wants and knows that he only wants to save the world. They come up with a plan to get everybody to like him... The village people think that Hancock is an evil man because of his bad temper and unusual powers. It turns out that Hancock is actually made to save everyone from evil. Hes not just loving he is also brave For example when he helps an old man whos shop is getting robbed. Hancock chases the two robbers. The special effects they use are fantastic Especially when Hancock flies through the night sky at the very end. My favourite character would have to be Mary (Charlize Theron). She seems like a normal human being however there might be a twist in store Hancock Rey and Aaron (Jae Head) find out a really big secret about Mary. So does the world... I think the moral of the story is to show people that not all superheroes are the same and not all superheroes wear costumes Even though Hancock has got superpowers is a superhero and everybody hates him I like the fact that Rey stays by his side and sticks up for him. You might think you know whats going to happen next... But you actually dont I think the best part of the film would have to be the romantic ending with the heart on the moon. This is because the film is all action then it turns to romance. This film is much better than any other superhero film Ive watched by far I would have to give it a star rating of 4. I dont think that I am the only one who thinks this film is great. For example Holly Braque from Liverpool says ""I cant stop watching for the first time a superhero has heart soul and realism"". This film is truly amazing and I advise you to watch itFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 6 2011abbyFeaturedHes fast Hes strong. Hes brave. Hes certainly bad tempered.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor July 4 2008 Save for later Saved Disgruntled superhero Hancock (Will Smith left) saves the life of a PR exec (Jason Bateman in car right) in Columbia Pictures Hancock. Columbia Pictures          View Caption About video ads View Caption of What superhero shall I vanquish this week? ""Hancock"" stars Will Smith as the eponymous headliner in what is being promoted as a revisionist bam-pow epic. But what is so new these days about a superhero who doesnt wear the mantle of heroism lightly? From ""Iron Man"" to ""The Incredible Hulk"" to ""Wanted"" - and this is just a culling from the past few months - the comic-book action stars have all been unwilling custodians of their powers. The true revisionism would be if a superhero actually enjoyed being a superhero.This is emphatically not the case with Hancock who is so bummed out about his prowess that he zooms around on his rescue missions half-inebriated. More often than not he creates as many problems as he solves. (His public boos him.) He is inevitably based in Los Angeles where image is all and his image desperately needs a makeover.When Hancock rescues from certain death an L.A. public relations ""image consultant"" Jason Batemans Ray Embrey Ray returns the favor by taking the highly reluctant super/anti-hero as his client. Director Peter Berg and his writers Vy Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan have gotten hold of a good satirical idea here In the modern media world everybody wants a makeover. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? But what begins as a pretty good comedy devolves rapidly into a high-flown example of Hollywood messagemongering. The message is that superheroes are people too - only more so. Ive rarely seen a movie that was as bifurcated as this one. Its not that I object to big tonal shifts. Some of the best movies ever made have traveled seamlessly from the rollicking to the horrific (""Bonnie and Clyde"" for example). But ""Hancock"" is like two entirely different movies - the first one being far better than the second - which leads me to the overwhelming suspicion that the filmmakers had two entirely different movies in mind and not knowing which one to make made both (or to be more exact made neither). Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Hancock The strain of messianism in Will Smith movies is becoming ever more pronounced. In the aptly titled ""I Am Legend"" he played the ostensibly lone survivor of a doomed planet. The characters humanity was held up as a tattered flag of righteousness. In ""Hancock"" the publics rejection of our hero exemplifies the loss of magic in a mundane world. Hancock may be a bum and an imbiber but only because we drove him to it. We dont appreciate him - we dont deserve him.Rays wife Mary (Charlize Theron in an improbably good performance) is especially unappreciative for reasons that become all too clear as the movie hits the midway point. Suffice it to say this plot development is such a bummer that the movie never really recovers. It may well be that because he is a megastar Smith believes he can do anything and audiences will love him for it. The brazenness of ""Hancock"" the way it confounds audience expectations for no good reason is an example of star power run amok.The irony is that ""Hancock"" - a movie about a hero who wants to be rid of his powers - is the brainchild of a star who revels in his powers without quite knowing what to do with them.Grade C- (Rated PG-13 for some intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence and language.)

"Review Hancock turns into a train wreck - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon Review Hancock turns into a train wreckStory Highlights CNN.coms Tom Charity ""Hancock"" starts strong goes off rails Film about truculent superhero takes odd turn for last half-hour King of July 4 Weekend Will Smith rest of cast tries hard cant overcome plot Next Article in Entertainment >> By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- Train wrecks are intrinsically spectacular and Will Smiths new movie offers a doozy. Two of them in fact. Jason Bateman and Will Smith star in ""Hancock."" In the first Jason Batemans genial public relations guy Ray is sitting in his car snarled in traffic and oblivious to the locomotive bearing down on him until its almost too late. Fortunately for Ray John Hancock (Smith) is on the case. Using his Superman-like powers Hancock flips Rays car up and over in a neat backward somersault safely out of harms way. At the same time he thrusts out his arm and stops the train in its tracks. While Ray is grateful the guy in the car underneath his isnt so sure -- and the damage to the derailed train stretches back a half-mile or more. Thats the train wreck within the movie. The train wreck that is the movie is even more interesting. We all know that Will Smith ""owns"" the July 4 weekend -- so much so there arent any other big openings this week (aside from the small-scale ""Kit Kittredge An American Girl"" which began in limited release last week). Since ""Independence Day"" hes virtually become synonymous with Big Summer Fun. And he makes it look so easy too. ""Hancock"" tinkers with that self-confidence a little bit. Apparently immortal and impervious to pain Hancock fulfills the superheros brief -- he safeguards the citizenry of Los Angeles -- but hes sunk well below complacency into an alcoholic stew of resentment and contempt for his public. When a young fan stirs him from a drunken stupor to chase some bad guys in the movies opening scene Hancock sends him off with an insult ""What do you want a cookie?"" Dont Miss iReport.com Another view of Hancock Later he picks up an obnoxious kid who has pushed his luck too far and flings him into the stratosphere catching him 30 seconds later with obvious reluctance. In short this is not the agreeable Will Smith we know and love and even in this summer of edgier angrier action heroes (see also ""Iron Man"" and ""The Incredible Hulk"") Hancock may be the first full-blown jerk to front a blockbuster. iReport.com Share your review of ""Hancock"" But before you jump to conclusions this is not the problem with the movie. Though the cynical adult edge to the comedy may limit the films audience (it is rated PG-13) it also qualifies as a welcome change. Hancocks reckless heroism -- and the wreckage he leaves in his wake -- inspires the films funniest stuff (which is why youve probably seen it all in the trailers). Cussing pulling on a bottle of booze as he chases down bad guys and dressing like a wino Smith has fun playing against type and in possibly his best big-screen performance yet Jason Bateman makes an engaging comic foil. Like ""Incredibles"" patriarch Mr. Incredible before him Hancock has alienated the authorities with his DIY approach to problem-solving. They even issue a warrant for his arrest. Ray -- who owes the guy his life and has invited him into his home to meet the wife (Charlize Theron) -- encourages Hancock to surrender himself serve some time address his alcohol and anger-management issues and wait for soaring crime statistics to pave his early release. Its when this scenario plays out that Peter Bergs movie jumps the tracks. Writers Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan have concocted an outrageous mind-boggling twist that comes so far out of left field you would need a crystal ball to see it coming. No spoilers here but it doesnt work not in the short term and not in the big picture either. Its as if weve been whisked from one kind of movie -- a brisk superficial but entertaining high-concept comedy -- and into the theater next door where theyre showing some sort of tragic ""X-Men"" knockoff. The last half-hour of this 92-minute movie is a fiasco. Bergs shaky-cam technique doesnt help nor does a weak inadequate villain (played by Eddie Marsan). Still its rare -- and startling -- to see a big-budget movie fall apart so dramatically. Whether it was inspired by ego or economics more than anything the turnaround feels like a colossal collective failure of nerve. ""Hancock"" will likely post strong long weekend figures but just watch those numbers plummet as the word gets out. A superhero can overcome many things but not a movie that goes off the rails. ""Hancock"" is rated PG-13 and runs 92 minutes.

"Will Smith in Hancock reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Will Smith in Hancock reviewed. Will Smith in Hancock reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 2 2008 422 PM Superbad Hancocks failed superhero satire. By Dana Stevens Will Smith left and Jason Bateman in Hancock In a summer when the broad deltoids of superheroes have been weighted down with the freight of existential despair (the Hulk is the new Hamlet; The Dark Knight the new Endgame) the timing seems perfect for a cynical corner-cutting mess of a superhero like Will Smiths character in Hancock (Columbia Pictures). Alas the movie is also a corner-cutting mess. Things get off to such a good start too with the drunken hero snoozing on a park bench as carjacking criminals run rampant through L.A. When a little boy awakens him with a request for help the surly Hancock clad in a watch cap and grimy shorts flies to the scene of the crime and sloppily apprehends the bad guys oblivious of the collateral damage (multicar pileups trashed public property) he inflicts along the way. Hancocks slipshod methods and crappy attitude have made him an unpopular figure in the city. After he saves Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) from a train wreck onlookers jeer at Hancocks poor technique Why couldnt he have prevented the collision entirely by lifting Rays car in the air and flying straight up? But Ray an idealistic PR executive takes pity on Hancock and invites him home to dinner with his wife Mary (Charlize Theron) and son Aaron (Jae Head). Eventually Hancock agrees to be coached in superhero etiquette by Ray a branding expert. Advertisement Hancocks rebranding will involve a jail term group therapy sessions and a skintight leather costume that he reluctantly dons to stop a bank robbery in progress. Smith and Bateman are such affable presences that even the mild laughs this premise offers make for a jolly opening hour. But a major revelation about a third character (along with a labored exegesis of Hancocks near-incomprehensible origin story) sends the movie into precisely the poor-tormented-superhero territory its supposed to be spoofing. Hancocks satire functions on the notion that it would be funny if saving the world from evil were just another job--one you could be good or bad at one that could inspire you or leave you with midcareer burnout. As soon as the hero becomes another wounded demigod brooding on rooftops that premise--and the movie--loses its sting. Peter Berg may be best-known for the 2004 football drama Friday Night Lights but he has surprisingly sharp instincts as a comic director. (His feature debut was the pitch-black 1998 cult comedy Very Bad Things.) One precisely timed slapstick scene in which Smith and Theron exchange furtive blows behind Batemans back points toward a promising new subgenre the comic-book movie as domestic farce. But only minutes after this scene the movie devolves into a blur of action set pieces and superhero metaphysics (you know that vaguely apocalyptic blather about the convergence of good and evil forces in the universe). The climax a multipart showdown in the corridors of a hospital is unforgivably manipulative. What self-respecting director still cuts away to shots of a heartbeat monitor flat-lining? Hancock isnt the only underachiever on the premises--the talented Berg settles for far less than he should. The movies final shot finds Hancock fully brand-optimized complete with costume and mascot atop the requisite skyscraper. Maybe in the sequel he can rebrand himself as funny. Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1. How Khizr Khan Helped Democrats Take Back Religious Liberty 2.

Elizabeth Weitzman Wednesday July 2 2008 1018 AM At this point nobody would argue that Will Smith deserves his own superhero franchise. Certainly the filmmakers whove watched him deliver feats of box-office glory one July after another already consider him heroic. But they let him down this year with ""Hancock"" a mishmash of a movie that no mere mortal could save.Part of the problem with Peter Bergs ill-conceived action flick is that while Smith is perfectly suited to saving the world he makes a surprisingly unconvincing bad guy. And John Hancock is not when we first meet him a likely candidate for Superhero of the Year. For one thing although he has unearthly strength and speed hes an unapologetic drunk. And for another his defiantly surly attitude could use a serious adjustment. While hell perform the occasional good deed he does it with so much reluctance that he usually gets more grief than gratitude. After he saves PR exec Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman likable as always) from a speeding train Ray brings Hancock home for dinner. Despite the objections of his disapproving wife (Charlize Theron) Ray has decided that his new project will be remaking Hancocks public image. Hancock grudgingly goes along with Rays plan since deep down hes just a lost soul hoping for a few genuine connections. Will Smiths a lost action hero and Charlize Theron is his PR guys irate spouse in Hancock. (Marcocchi/Getty) An ongoing bout of amnesia means he cant remember anything about his past - not even how he got the abilities that make him feel like an alienated freak. While everyone seems to want something from him all he wants is to figure out who he really is. Unfortunately the movie suffers from the same sort of identity crisis. Theres a great idea here but its buried within a muddled story that lurches between dark comedy and maudlin drama. The big twist is telegraphed so early that it feels silly and anticlimatic when it actually arrives. And without strong direction or a solid script to count on Smith seems downright uncomfortable playing an irritable antihero. Granted hes always a charismatic presence and he still has the power to draw supersized crowds. But ""Hancock"" gives proof that even summers most reliable star is human after all. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"The cure for saccharine superhero? ""Hancock"" - The Denver Post Entertainment Hot Topics Public Lands Day Colorado Unemployment New Denver Post Website Coming The Cannabist News Tips Print Email Font ResizeMoviesThe cure for saccharine superhero? ""Hancock"" 1/2 RATING | Superhero ActionBy Lisa Kennedy Denver Post Film CriticPosted 07/01/2008 062254 AM MDTUpdated 07/01/2008 072603 PM MDT Will Smith is a troubled superhero who tries to help the City of Angels in ""Hancock"" but his actions invite secondguessing not gratitude in L.A. (Columbia Pictures ) One of the stars in the just- closed musical ""Three Mo Divas"" broke it down this way ""The blues are like walking through hell with gasoline drawers on."" John Hancock knows what shes talking about. The down and out (and angry) protagonist of ""Hancock"" has been there. Literally. After emerging from a burning building he once flashed his singed glutes at kids gathered around an ice cream truck. Hes still living in some personal hell at the outset of summers most ambitious superhero saga. Played with finesse by Will Smith Hancock shows scant signs of shaking off his bitter moods. Little wonder a twanging throbbing blues riff introduces the unkempt L.A. denizen sleeping it off on a bench as a major freeway shootout transpires. Peter Berg directs this bracing concoction of action repartee and redemption with the same fine grasp of pleasures and principles he showed in ""The Kingdom"" and ""Friday Night Lights."" Hancock lives in a trailer reminiscent of the one ""Lethal Weapon"" cop Martin Riggs holed up in after the loss of his wife. Learning whats eating at Hancock provides a steady payoff. Signs of Hancocks disenchantment range from alcohol abuse to rank personal hygiene to sorry interpersonal skills with regular folk. His dont-give-a-damn rejoinders tip the movies PG-13 rating toward R. Los Angeles isnt feeling the love either. Hancocks rescues invite second-guessing not gratitude. With each the city takes another body blow to its infrastructure.Advertisement Even CNNs resident Pomeranian Nancy Grace yaps her displeasure. A typically clumsy intervention by the super-gifted bum leads to an intervention of a different sort and sends this action-FX ride in surprisingly humane directions. When Hancock saves Ray Embrey he lands a PR agent with a heart and a plan for rehabilitation that includes a stint in jail. Jason Bateman is a master of the understated quip. His nimble thoughtful delivery keeps Ray from being either rube or huckster. He cares about his client. ""Your landing is your superhero handshake"" he tells Hancock who lands hot and hard. Hancock may want to be alone. Smith however has inspired company in Bateman and Charlize Theron who plays Rays wife Mary. Like other Angelenos shes exasperated by the crime fighters seeming narcissism. A patient build-up of tension (the scripts and Therons) suggests something else lies beneath Marys attitude toward Hancock. Jae Head is sweet not fawning as their son Aaron. He digs without reservation the superhero who comes to dinner. Since ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" actor-producer Smith has made no secret of his desire to make movies that entertain in that big-studio way but also dig deeper. ""Hancock"" is a rousing measure of that intent. Written byVy Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan ""Hancock"" can easily be read as a fable of career resuscitation. Hancocks statement before serving time in a prison crowded with inmates looking for payback sounds awfully familiar. How many embroiled sports stars -- physically the closest thing we have to superheroes -- have stood in front of mics and flashing cameras reading PR-crafted mea culpas they dont believe? For a spell Hancock the super-man invites the same sort of cynicism. ""Hancock"" the movie triumphs over it. Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com; also on blogs.denverpostcom /madmoviegoer ""Hancock"" PG-13 for some intense sequences of sci-fi action violence and language. 1 hours 32 minutes.

Starring Will Smith Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman. Directed by Peter Berg. (PG-13. 92 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) What if a homeless guy sleeping on a bench turned out to be a superhero? ""Hancock"" is based on that ""what if"" premise and screenwriters Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan run with it pursuing and developing it honestly and arriving at some interesting and unexpected places. Yet as delivered by director Peter Berg ""Hancock"" is never as serious or funny or poignant as it could be. And despite clocking in at a reasonable running time it has a big sag in the middle that nothing could have fixed. ""Hancock"" is more intelligent than most summer blockbusters and features at its center a thought-out and committed performance by Will Smith. But in the end its merely almost good. It takes place in the Los Angeles of the near future (about three years from now) in which Hancock (Smith) is a well-known superhero with an alcohol problem. Smith plays him as a homeless drunk glazing over his self-disgust with liquor and hiding what awareness he has left under a veneer of impassivity. Its a nice thing about Smiths performance He lets the comedy come from the context but he plays it straight. The actor has clearly made a point of observing guys on park benches. Every superhero has powers and limitations from the low end (Batman) to the high end (Superman). Hancock is on the high end of the scale. Theres nothing he cant do but because hes drunk and apathetic hes sloppy about it. The public loathes him because every time he does something good he ends up ripping apart roads and demolishing buildings. Bad summer blockbusters establish a premise and then repeat the same actions for 20 or 30 minutes but ""Hancock"" is generous when it comes to story. When our hero happens to rescue an idealistic public relations man (Jason Bateman) from a speeding train the man volunteers to help rescue Hancocks public image. This event which in another blockbuster might constitute the middle of the story is where the movie opens. ""Hancock"" is an original creation not based on a comic book series. It lacks the fable-like quality that comic book adaptations have at their best but it also lacks the compressed frenetic action-packed-nonsense quality of comic book adaptations at their worst. Not limited by what some writer thought up 40 years ago the filmmakers attempt to break into new territory with ""Hancock."" They look at the whole superhero thing with fresh eyes even to the extent of examining - to the degree the blockbuster form permits (not much) - the spiritual implications of such beings walking the earth. In ""Hancock"" the word ""superheroes"" is merely a secular term for what a more religious age called ""angels"" and the pagans called ""gods."" Nice idea. But then again so what if it all boils down to the same thing - an evenly matched battle between two superheroes taking place on the city streets? ""The Incredible Hulk"" had an almost identical scene. So did ""Iron Man."" Thats three already and this is only the first week in July. By the way what is the appeal of watching two titans battle it out on the street wrecking buildings and ripping up roads? Since it has been a recurring motif throughout the history of superhero and monster movies there must be some allure to it. Heres what it is the fantasy of being a bystander and having a built-in unassailable excuse to take a day off. Smith has become a good actor over the years. Ten years ago he was a likable fellow with a knack for the wisecrack but hes grown into something deeper and Charlize Theron matches him in several heartfelt scenes. But either due to the overall subject matter or to some missed notes in Bergs direction the movie feels trivial as an emotional piece and never takes off as an action movie. The special effects are ho-hum and in the dramatic scenes the actors seem to be feeling a lot more than the audience. Thats never a good sign. -- Advisory Substance abuse scenes of peril and action violence. -- A review of ""Kit Kittredge An American Girl"" Page E10.

Sony Pictures ""Hancock"" has been packaged and heavily promoted as a summer blockbuster -- a big spectacular production starring the ever-likable Will Smith. It is indeed summer and Mr. Smith plays the title role but thats as far as any truth in advertising goes. The movie seems negligible; its running time is a mere 92 minutes. And it succeeds only at the hitherto-impossible task of making Mr. Smith disagreeable (though never boring; whatever he does hes a movie star). He plays a gangsta superhero -- a foulmouthed misanthropic booze-slugging slob who happens to have superpowers. Its a tricky notion done badly though surely an oddity that will find a large audience. Any notions of demolishing black stereotypes -- and what else could have possessed Mr. Smith to do this? -- are dashed by the coarseness of it all and by the narrative incoherence; a surprising plot twist turns a sloppy action-comedy into a totally different movie and an even worse one. See a clip from the film Hancock. Video courtesy of Sony Pictures. The sloppiness is quite startling. A similar starting point -- a superhero who has worn out his welcome with the public -- was developed elegantly and imaginatively in ""The Incredibles."" But theres no development here just a string of clangorous action sequences and a fusillade of givens -- Hancock is a bum he can fly his strength is limitless and he creates chaos wherever he goes. (In a video harangue the inaptly named Nancy Grace reminds him that hes not above the law.) As it turns out though Hancock behaves badly because hes lonely and feels misunderstood. He reveals this side of himself when Ray a sentimental public-relations executive played nicely by Jason Bateman sets out to clean up Hancocks image so he can be a happier person and a more effective superhero. Not a bad idea at all but here again what might have been amusing grows soggy and ponderous. How much can one care about the travails of a surrogate Superman when the threat of kryptonite is replaced by shaky self-esteem? (The director Peter Berg uses the false energy of tight close-ups whenever theres a sag in the illusory energy of the overproduced action.) Rays wife Mary is played by Charlize Theron whom I always end up praising in more or less the same way Beautiful as she is shes also a terrific actress. This time Ill add something else -- she has a beautifully modulated voice. But shes the only modulation model on the premises. Once the tale takes its radical turn every vestige of subtlety is blown away. Thats not bad in theory; surprise is the lifeblood of drama. In this case though theres a sense that the filmmakers are as bewildered as their audience by the new movie that begins just as the original one is petering out. A new movie that makes the previous pandemonium seem downright restrained.    See a clip from the film Tell No One. Video courtesy of Music Box Films. Thrillers arent always so thrilling but ""Tell No One"" is -- and absorbing sometimes perplexing and often stirring as well. A French film with good English subtitles (the French title is ""Ne le Dit a Personne"") it was directed by Guillaume Canet who with Philippe Lefebvre adapted the script from a crime novel by the American author Harlan Coben. The hero a pediatrician named Alexandre Beck has lost his beloved wife She was murdered near the shore of a lake theyd been visiting since they were children in love with one another. Eight years later with the killers identify still unknown he starts receiving cryptic emails suggesting shes still alive. From that point forward everything he thinks he knows about the circumstances of the crime and everything we think we know from a series of flashbacks -- a surfeit of flashbacks I must admit -- dissolves in doubt or explodes into chases that had my eyes sitting on the edge of their lids. (In one scene worth the price of admission Beck crosses a Paris beltway through hurtling traffic.) ENLARGE Marie-Josee Croze and Francois Cluzet in Tell No One Jean-Claude Lother The convoluted story is sustained by the heros love and the production is distinguished -- I use the word advisedly -- by the directors taut style the stunning cinematography (by Christophe Offenstein) the bold sound track (dominated by Matthieu Chedids meditative guitar) and most of all the sensational yet self-effacing cast. Beck is played by Francois Cluzet a veteran French actor whose intensity here reminded me of Dustin Hoffman at his best. His wife Margot is played by Marie-Josee Croze the French-Canadian actress who gave an exquisite performance as the speech therapist in ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly."" And if thats not enticement enough the cast includes Kristin Scott-Thomas (as magnetic speaking French as she is speaking English) Nathalie Baye Jean Rochefort and Gilles Lellouche. The director plays the role of a not-nice guy -- a really not-nice guy -- and Francois Berleand plays quietly and brilliantly a Versailles police captain whos a really really good guy.    Dalton Trumbo was the most celebrated or reviled and the most famous or infamous of the Hollywood 10 the group of writers directors and producers who in the late 1940s were accused of being communist sympathizers by the House Un-American Activities Committee then blacklisted by the Hollywood studios. Unarguably though he was the most successful screenwriter of his day and one of the most talented. A fascinating new documentary ""Trumbo"" is based on the stage play of the same name written by his son Christopher Trumbo. In the film directed by Peter Askin Trumbos life and turbulent times are evoked in his letters which are read by Joan Allen Brian Dennehy Michael Douglas Paul Giamatti Nathan Lane Josh Lucas Liam Neeson David Strathairn and Donald Sutherland. He was by his own admission an angry combative man. He was also a great self-dramatist so the tone of his letters is often lofty sardonic or scornful. Held in contempt of Congress he acknowledged the justice of the verdict; he did he said have contempt for the Congress that stripped him and his fellow defendants of their personal and professional reputations of their livelihoods because of what may or may not have been their political beliefs. ""Trumbo"" doesnt pretend to be tough-minded about its subject and its failure to date the letters is an annoyance. But the substance of those letters along with documentary footage and a touching appearance by Kirk Douglas throws a baleful light on a bleak chapter of American history.    A correction Last week in a DVD tip for ""Silent Running"" I wrote that the movies little droids were played by dwarfs. In fact they were played by bilateral amputees.

Oh he can fly; his chest does repel point-blank bullets. And he saves people averts catastrophe stops bad guys from doing bad things. But Hancock has a personality defect hes a horrible human being/deity. He guzzles way too much Royal Crown which puts him in a perpetually bad mood and interferes with his self-aviation skills -- the man is a drunk flyer. (And then he lands so hard on a street he digs a ditch in the asphalt.) He wrecks everything he touches. When hes finished a mission all of L.A. has become collateral damage. Once Hancock was summoned to the aid of a whale that had washed up on the beach. When he lifted the creature by its tail and tossed it back in the sea it landed on a distant ship. ""I dont remember that"" he says to somebody who replies ""Greenpeace does."" I just realized something. None of this matters. A critique of Hancock is an essay in irrelevance. Its Independence Day Week and six times since 1996 thats meant a Will Smith movie -- a mega-giga-gigantic hit. Independence Day; Men in Black; Wild Wild West; Men in Black II; I Robot He shows up people line up. Thomas Jefferson used to own this holiday but now the former Fresh Prince does. So why should critics even bother to review a new Will Smith movie? Youll go see it anyway. Its my theory -- and I have the stats to back me up -- that Hollywood is in its first ever post-movie-star era. Big celebrity names no longer guarantee box-office hits. Casting dramatic stars like Tom Hanks George Clooney Brad Pitt Tom Cruise Julia Roberts Cate Blanchett Angelina Jolie etc. no longer guarantees a movies commercial success; and the more reliable comedy stars from Adam Sandler to Ben Stiller lose much of their audiences when they try something a little different. To all this Smith would say ha and rightly so since hes the big exception. He actually deserves that overused epithet ""the last movie star."" For more than a decade hes been immune to moviegoers fickle fashions. His films have earned 4.5 billion worldwide. And except for his pro bono work in Ali (for which he won an Academy Award nomination) and Robert Redfords The Legend of Bagger Vance every Will Smith movie has been a hit or smash earning at least 100 million in North America and another 100 million or more abroad. Sometimes lots more. Start with Independence Day 306m at home 511m abroad for a worldwide 817m (back in 1996 when that was real money). The following year he did Men in Black 251m at home 339m abroad for a total of 598m. Last years I Am Legend -- which earned 256m in the U.S. and Canada 328m elsewhere for 584m -- was Smiths fifth consecutive movie to earn more than 300m worldwide after I Robot; Shark Tale; Hitch; and The Pursuit of Happyness. No actor can come within geshrei-ing distance of those numbers. Certainly nobody whos lured crowds to different genres. Hes made action films romances heart-tuggers cartoons; but to audiences what they mainly are is Will Smith movies. And thats enough. A friendly fellow with whats thought to be a famously sound marriage (to Jada Pinkett Smith) Smith radiates a strong but unthreatening power. His manner suggests an actor at ease with himself and his screen stature in a way not often seen since the days of Clark Gable and Jimmy Stewart (though Burt Reynolds and Clint Eastwood have come close). Hes utterly unconflicted about his job; he likes being watched but he doesnt preen doesnt beg or mug for our attention. He knows hes got it. Its good to be the King of Hollywood -- of the entertainment world. Smith is above and apart leaping national borders transcending race. Eddie Murphy or Martin Lawrence might be considered black stars but Smith is not so much defined by his color. Hes also black -- the Tiger Woods the Oprah maybe the Barack Obama of movie actors. Hes the superstar everybody likes. The final evidence of his flop-proofness is the movies he makes. Theyre not that good. Tom Hanks had a great run in making challenging movies of Academy quality. Smiths pictures deliver familiar pleasures; they work with efficiency but not inspiration honoring the time-honored movie platitudes that will neither shock nor stretch an audience. Hancock directed by Peter Berg (Friday Night Lights The Kingdom) and written by Vy Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan is another of those. Its only distinction is its aim to vault from one genre to another and another while keeping viewers from straying to the popcorn stand. Its strenuous smartly made and ordinary to an extraordinary degree. These days the big action fantasies mostly come in two flavors superheroes who achieve their superiority (younger versions of Superman Batman etc.) and superheroes in a midlife crisis (The Incredibles My Super Ex-Girlfriend). Hancock is the second. Hes lost his purpose his mojo and his fan base. Thats where Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) a slick but somehow decent p.r. guy hopes to help. He wants to repackage and even more remake Hancock into a good guy. After all he figures he owes Hancock. When Rays car was stuck on railroad tracks Hancock stopped an onrushing train by essentially standing in the way and punching its lights out meanwhile flipping Rays car into the air till it landed upside down on another vehicle. So Ray takes Hancock home to meet his loving wife Mary (Charlize Theron) whos apprehensive to say the least at the prospect of this belching snot-blowing slob doing his act in front of their young son Aaron (Jae Head). True to his word Ray dresses Hancock up in a trendy black superhero suit has him serve some time for laying waste to the city and writes him his own public apology ""You deserve better from me. I can be better. I will be better."" Turns out Hancock isnt quite the rehab vehicle it seems to be. It wants to be half a dozen different films -- all the kinds of movies Smith has been making. Its an action film that starts as cartoon then detours into identity crisis since Hancock suffering from amnesia doesnt know who he really is. Maybe the Embreys can help. In this uncomfortable trio of Hancock Ray and Mary two are alike one is different. (The question is which two?) As the movie changes tone it wants you to concentrate on the sweetness in Rays protective friendship with Hancock and in Marys virtually celestial devotion to Ray. Perhaps she could feel that way about Hancock too. Im trying not to give away Act 2 just to hint at a triangular romance a potential mixed marriage. If youre a Will Smith fan you know that romance isnt the focus of his movies (except for Hitch). Just as he is bigger than any of his co-stars his characters are bigger too; to connect intimately with someone else would be a step down. Thats why his movies are often about him alone slogging through homelessness in The Pursuit of Happyness foraging as the last man in Manhattan in I Am Legend. The one true romance in a Will Smith film is between the star and his audience. And thats a match that for a dozen years has been made in box-office heaven. Then again if youre a Will Smith fan you stopped reading this long ago. Youre probably watching Hancock right now and enjoying it a little more than you would if anyone but Smith were in it.

The designation is a punch line in itself uttered throughout the movie with a glee that challenges profanity conventions in a mainstream publication since one of the feats Smith sets for himself in his latest attempt at Fourth of July box office superheroism is to apply his kryptonite-resistant personal likability to a character who is at first glance a real schmuck. After some sort of accident the reluctant crimestopper doesnt know who he is or why hes in L.A. (hence the generic name John Hancock); he just knows he possesses otherworldly talents for flying and hurling automobiles among other attributes useful for surviving in the City of Angels. And at first close encounter hes an alcohol-soaked curmudgeon with a bums wardrobe and a really bad attitude. Even those he saves wish he would go be a hero somewhere else. Hancock can revel in schmuckery of course because you and I and cute kids and peaceful oldies worldwide know in advance that theres no way on Hollywoods green earth Will Smith will ever play someone seriously dangerously unsavory. Charm is the stars armor on either side of the alien-human divide whether hes a Fresh Prince a Bad Boy a Man in Black the last man alive in New York City or Muhammad Ali. And so in the beginning the movie -- part comedy part action-thriller and a whole lot of earnest addled mush about purpose fate and angels -- lets Smith (who is also one of the producers) have fun goofing on all that has already served him so well as a performer Heres a hero in need of remedial charm school. In the storys most original notion (the script is credited to first-timer Vy Vincent Ngo and X-Files staff writer Vince Gilligan) Hancock saves a PR executive named Ray (Jason Bateman). In addition to inviting the hungry superhero over for a thank-you dinner of spaghetti meatballs and family togetherness with his dubious dewy wife (Charlize Theron) and their bright sprite of a son (Friday Night Lights Jae Head) Ray gets the idealistic brainstorm to rehabilitate Hancock with a personalized image makeover. He aims to turn the mutt into a better person as well as a more super hero. The PR pro also harbors an unabashedly idealistic desire to make the world a better place by encouraging rich companies to donate lifesaving products to the poor -- a business goal that no matter how noble comes across like an unasked-for lesson in a movie released when schools out. The scenes of Hancock improving his presentation skills complete with a Queer Eye-ready custom costume are droll with a big assist from Bateman and the attitude of controlled exasperation he perfected on Arrested Development. (Rays wife is more skeptical of Hancocks capacity for rehabilitation and she demonstrates that by giving their guest what appears to be the stink eye. Their son seems to think the visitor is as cool as Will Smith.) But then the movie goes someplace else a direction not to be revealed except to say that Hancock the jaunty jokey riff on the screwed-up inner emotional life of a traditionally ironclad superhero becomes Hancock the icky lesson in the importance of personal responsibility loyalty and continued family togetherness. Also of making the world a better place and keeping Will Smiths income steady. And oh yes theres that talk of angels or is it some sci-fi race of extraterrestrials whod feel at home in Battlefield Earth? To further confound clarity director Peter Berg (The Kingdom) and cinematographer Tobias Schliessler favor a visual style that can best be described as Serious Focus on the Eyeball. Arty randomly inserted extreme close-ups on a quadrant of Smiths lovely face or Therons or Batemans are meant to convey intensity of emotional content. Really what moviegoers hanker for is a hero to step in and adjust the depth of focus to something suitable for a cute movie about a magical dude who smashes tall buildings with a single bound.

Will Smith stars as a down-on-his-luck superhero in Hancock. Photo SONY PICTURES ENTERTAINMENT Hancock 1 / 1 Back to Gallery In Hancock arguably the most ambitious and certainly the most audacious of the megabudget popcorn flicks to appear so far this summer superstar Will Smith and some exceptionally talented collaborators pose a provocative question What if Superman wasnt such a super guy? Consider What if the Man of Steel got totally bummed out about being the only being of his kind and used 100-proof self-medication to cope with deep blue funks? What if all the booze and the blues began to affect his job performance? The makers of Hancock cleverly imagine and vividly render all of this and much more in a deliberately discordant exuberantly sloppy extravaganza that veers wildly between edgy grit and zany farce low comedy and high drama comic-book action and operatic passion. It helps of course that we have Smith the most charismatic movie actor in the known universe to help us maneuver through the sharp curves of the scenario credited to screenwriters Vy Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan. The opening scenes introduce us to Hancock a gone-to-seed superhero as a borderline derelict who drinks himself into superstupors passes out on bus-stop benches and only reluctantly rouses himself to take flight in pursuit of bad guys. Hancock isnt really bad hes just misunderstood. Well he can be quite bad actually. Or at least bad boyish in the manner of a frat-house prankster whos too hung over to notice or really care that he burned a hole in the sofa with his cigarette after a hard night of partying. Trouble is when youre as superpowerful as Hancock carelessness can result in smashed streets demolished buildings and litigious innocent bystanders. By the time we meet Hancock most of his fellow Los Angelenos are ready to have him arrested and cable-news scold Nancy Grace (played in a bold stroke of casting by Nancy Grace) is criticizing his reckless behavior on a nightly basis. He gets a shot at redemption when an eager-beaver public-relations whiz named Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) offers to help Hancock rehabilitate his public image by more or less relaunching himself as the new and improved Hancock 2.0. But just about everyone else -- including Mary (Charlize Theron) Rays wife -- is skeptical. Even Hancock requires convincing that hes not permanently damaged goods. Theres a lot more that happens next in Hancock but trust me you wouldnt appreciate it if I told you much about it. There are at least two major plot twists that shouldnt be revealed or even indirectly referenced and two absolutely splendid performances (by Theron and Bateman) that cant be sufficiently praised without spilling some beans. It is safe to say that Smith gives an inspired performance whether hes going for laughs or playing for keeps in a surprisingly complex role. And credit must be paid to director Peter Berg (Friday Night Lights) for pulling off such a tricky balance of such diverse elements while delivering an impressive and affecting superhero adventure with as much heart and soul as sound and fury. Any flaws? A few most notably a villain unworthy of the hero. But nothing serious. The superheroics? Exciting and amusing in just the right measure with world-class special effects to enable an easy suspension of disbelief. Should you take young children? Probably not if youre squeamish about salty language. Or worried about how the small fry will react to an emotionally intense climax with an unusually potent impact. But really you should take my advice Dont read anything else about Hancock before you see it. Dont even talk to friends who take this roller-coaster ride before you do. Savor the surprises and enjoy the action before anyone spoils your fun.

That in a nutshell is the premise of ""Hancock"" Will Smiths attempt to reinvent the superhero genre. Theres lots of potential there though the question arises whether the concept is more suitable to a five-minute ""Saturday Night Live"" skit than to a feature film.At first ""Hancock"" has the makings of rich satire. The bulletproof invincible but mysteriously angry Hancock saves the life of idealistic PR man Ray Embry (Jason Bateman) who vows to return the favor by giving the unpopular crime-buster an image makeover. Detox a course in anger management and a voluntary stint in jail are prescribed but Hancock draws the line at wearing the sleek new superhero suit his flack gives him (too ""homo""). Smith doesnt try to make Hancock likeable because he and the filmmakers know well like him anyway--hes Will Smith the most popular movie star in the world. The audience chuckles indulgently at his belligerent one-liners knowing perfectly well that Hancock wont stay a bad guy for long.The first half of the movie directed by Peter Berg (""Friday Night Lights"") from a screenplay credited to Vy Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan (but worked on by many hands) keeps your hopes up even though it never quite jells. The storytelling rhythm seems rushed and Bergs fondness for giant close-ups jittery verite camerawork and nervous cross-cutting tries to impose a patina of hard-nosed realism on a conceit that grows more fanciful and convoluted as it goes. Still Bateman and Smith both of whom possess near-infallible instincts for comic timing make a good odd-couple team and Charlize Theron looking great and not trying to win an Oscar is appealing as Batemans strangely tense wife--her aversion to Hancock seems oddly virulent suggesting an attraction she doesnt want to acknowledge. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Then nearly an hour into this misshapen 90-minute entertainment ""Hancock"" takes a disastrous left turn abandoning all its satirical setups and all sense. I wont play spoiler and reveal the plot twist that sends the movie into its nosedive but it reeks of desperation. Its as if an entire new movie starts up; unfortunately its not the one we want to see. We learn far too much about Hancocks back story--how he came to be the damaged superhero he is--as the film frantically changes its rules from scene to tonally jarring scene ending with a chaotically inept action sequence and a grandiose Liebestod with Wagnerian pretensions. Oy what a messThe movie may prove to be a hit--when was the last time a Will Smith movie wasnt?--but it feels like a wasted opportunity. The superhero genre screams for a makeover or at least a smart deconstruction but ""Hancock"" isnt that movie. It just ups the foolishness ante.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

The more entertaining one is a superhero spoof crammed with laughs and action. PHOTO GALLERY Hancock MORE Lou Lumenicks Movies Blog The choppy final half-hour veers off in a stunningly different direction centering on perhaps the least likely romantic triangle in screen history. This movie fails so spectacularly - and on so many levels - that its like watching a train plummet off a bridge. Id guess that legions of fans have made Smith the worlds biggest box-office attraction and will put up with this because the first part mostly meets their expectations however modest. Parents should be cautioned though that ""Hancock"" contains gratuitous levels of violence and profanity (including disgracefully three uses of an anti-gay epithet and too many ""a - - holes"" to count) for a movie with a PG-13 rating. Smith is smoothly effective as Hancock a disheveled trash-talking superhero first seen sleeping off a drunk on a park bench while surrounded by booze bottles. Hancock verbally abuses a youngster who tries to alert him to a major crime in progress before woozily heading off into action. That action including impaling a vehicle atop LAs Capitol Records building results in millions of dollars worth of damage and triggers the latest in a series of subpoenas that the attitude-challenged Hancock has long ignored. Hancock has an image problem that Ray (Jason Bateman) - possibly the first altruistic p.r. man Ive encountered - is eager to fix. He meets Hancock after our hero plucks Rays stuck car from the path of an oncoming train - even if Hancock does end up totaling the vehicle along with Rays driveway. Ray has his client surrender and go to jail which turns out to look at lot like Adam Sandlers remake of ""The Longest Yard."" This damage-control specialist knows the LAPD will eventually need Hancocks services no matter how messy the side effects. When the call finally comes Hancock shaves off his stubble and dons a snappy pleather suit to handle a hostage situation in a bank all the while exuding bonhomie. Unfortunately the filmmakers dont seem to be interested in developing this story line (or providing an interesting villain). They ditch it for a totally new twist on the genre which would be laudable if it actually worked. Director Peter Berg (the Arab-bashing ""The Kingdom"") has been working in a fairly realistic violent mode so its a shock when the movie suddenly gets touchy-feely talking about Hancocks back story and powers and vulnerabilities which seem to change from scene to scene. All this talking also violates a cardinal rule of the movies ""Show dont tell."" But I have a feeling ""Hancock"" will offer numerous deleted flashback scenes on the DVD. I havent even mentioned second-billed Charlize Theron who as Rays wife Mary does little more than glower at Hancock for the first two-thirds of the film. To say that Mary has a past would be the understatement of the summer. Lets just say her character makes no sense. Nor are Marys relationships with Ray or Hancock remotely plausible even in a fantasy context. Leaving behind the laughs for schmaltz ""Hancock"" chickens out at the last minute lurching toward a cop-out happy ending that gives every indication of having been reshot at the behest of test audiences. Well at least you wont be bored. lou.lumenicknypost.com HANCOCKRunning time 92 minutes. Rated PG-13 (gratuitous violence profanity). Tonight at the E-Walk the Lincoln Square others.

"Superbad hero a new twist for Smith | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesSuperbad hero a new twist for Smith John Hancock (Will Smith) takes the crab cake in this summer of grumpy supermen. Hes more corrosive than Iron Man and flintier than Hellboy .When disgruntled superhero Hancock (Will Smith left) saves the life of PR exec Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman in car) Ray tries to clean up Hancocks image in Columbia Pictures Hancock  (COLUMBIA PICTURES)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticTues. July 1 2008Starring Will Smith Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron. Directed by Peter Berg. 92 minutes. At major theatres. PGJohn Hancock (Will Smith) takes the crab cake in this summer of grumpy supermen. Hes more corrosive than Iron Man and flintier than Hellboy. As he demonstrates in the opening frames of Hancock a movie that is two-thirds of a great idea hes the kind of hero who makes you think villains arent so bad after all.Roused from his alcoholic stupor to stop a high-speed chase on a Los Angeles freeway Hancock causes nearly 10 million in property damage. The citys gratitude is muted by complaints that his cure for crime could push L.A. into penury. Thanks for nothing manAll of which makes Hancock one of the most realistic and stimulating superhero movies in a long while until it slams into a brick wall about an hour into its 92-minute run.Article Continued BelowDirector Peter Berg (The Kingdom) and screenwriters Vy Vincent Ngo (BMWs The Hire ads) and Vince Gilligan (TVs The X Files) have cottoned to a reality that most action films ignore the high cost of being saved. How many times have we watched guys like Spider-Man and the Incredible Hulk stop bad guys by stomping a few buildings and bridges into rubble? Pity the street sweepers and demolition crews who must follow in their wake.And Hancock who is like Superman with bad manners and a major attitude isnt the least bit contrite or polite.Chronically depressed hung over and hygiene-averse he haunts park benches and has to be goaded into lending a hand.Dudley Do-Right hes not and hes also the antithesis of the smooth characters that Smith normally plays.But things change after Hancock saves public relations image-maker Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) from a fatal collision with a train (which the train doesnt survive). Ray sees Hancock as a rough gem in need of some polishing which he intends to provide. Rays wife Mary (Charlize Theron) however views the homeboy hero as the lump of coal in the Christmas stocking ""You see the good in everybody Ray. Even sometimes when its not there.""Hancocks mysterious origin and motivation keep the movie alive in the early going. We arent at first burdened with the standard back-story about radioactive insect bites or errant gamma rays. Nor are we troubled with any kind of explanation why Hancock doesnt just move to a remote locale where he can smash things to his hearts content without having to deal with ingrates who quibble about unscheduled demolitions.It seems that Hancock has been hanging around L.A. for so long for reasons unknown hes become familiar to the point of contempt. Hes as popular as a hand grenade in a china factory a situation Ray intends to change.Another change is far less welcome. Its that point in the movie where it abruptly switches from a story of redemption into a tale of the fantastic that trashes any semblance of logic.In fact its nuttier than M. Night Shyamalans killer trees. But at least no one could say they saw the twist coming. Not helping matters at all is Bergs insistence on using shaky-cam techniques that do nothing but invite vertigo. Why have a camera this unhinged when the ground is already crumbling beneath us?The film invites humour which Smith excels at but too often it is of the vulgar kind. A prison scene where Hancock finally makes good on his repeated threat to shove somebodys head up somebody elses butt is funny only if youre into the crudest of sight gags.Its possible even likely that Berg and his screenwriters simply didnt know where to take the story. The original script has reportedly been bouncing around Hollywood for the past decade.Hancock is still worth seeing if only for a glimpse of what might have been a truly innovative idea. As it is the movie is as rough around the edges as Will Smiths ham-fisted hero.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Hancock Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2008) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/hancock-2008,200,hancock20,hancock,rogerebert
"Hancock | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; hancock ) Hancock (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Hancock is a hodgepodge of intriguing ideas that if developed further or presented as more than throw-ins to a confused production might have made for a unique superhero film. The resulting movie however shows all the signs of studio interference and never establishes a clear identity or tone. To the extent that Hancock works its largely because of Will Smith whose performance is stronger than what this otherwise scattershot production deserves. Hancock is sometimes funny sometimes clever and occasionally involving but its never brilliant and its edge is compromised by the neutering that accompanies the teen-friendly PG-13 rating. Imagine Superman as an alcoholic misanthrope and youve got John Hancock (Will Smith) a downtrodden man with superpowers who just doesnt give a damn. His life philosophy is encapsulated by one word ""asshole."" Thats what he thinks of everyone and thats what they think of him. Hancocks rescues often turn into fiascos. On one occasion he gets the bad guys but in the process causes 9 million in collateral damage. On another occasion he saves a guy from getting hit by a freight train but in the process damages a few automobiles and causes the train to derail. Life is like that for Hancock. The D.A. wants him behind bars (the kind found in prison - not the kind hes familiar with) and hes being sued by seemingly half the people in the city. Hes always got a bottle in his hand and even the kids who could be cheering him are calling him an ""asshole."" Things start to change when he saves Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) from the train. Ray the proprietor of his own floundering P.R. business recognizes Hancocks shortcomings but believes that with a little image makeover Hancock can become a beloved figure. The image reformation comes with a price tag however a prison stint rehab a shave and a cheesy costume. Meanwhile Rays wife Mary (Charlize Theron) and Hancock are exchanging meaningful glances hinting at a past connection. And while Hancock appears to be invulnerable everyone knows that all Supermen have their Kryptonites. Hancock is two films. The first the tale of the anti-hero learning to be a defender of Truth Justice and the American Way is by far the more entertaining of the two. The movies second piece is muddled and disjointed as the screenplay provides revelations about Hancocks origin. This aspect of the production has the scope of a Shakespearean tragedy and cannot effectively be addressed in the 45 minutes allotted to it. Both halves could have worked if properly expanded with the gaps filled in but by compressing them into a single unit the story as a whole suffers. Hancocks opening segments occasionally call to mind the likes of the Arnold Schwarzenegger spoof Last Action Hero and the Pixar animated superhero movie The Incredibles. The film credited to director Peter Berg has that sort of sensibility as it works to demythologize the superhero. Hancock is indeed the perfect asshole and there are plenty of opportunities for comedy. Smith the consummate professional wrings as much humor as he can from these situations so there are laughs to be had. Theres also a sense that someone other than Berg has his fingerprints on this project. A lot of the material is R-rated but it has been cut and cropped and shot in such a way that it can get away with a PG-13. Theres something fundamentally dishonest about taking inherently adult material and chipping away at it until its tame enough to be suitable for all ages. Hancocks tone becomes more subdued although not entirely downbeat during the second half as the main character faces the sad truth about himself and his past. The ending is a complete mess. In order to achieve a balance between tension tragedy and smiles the film doesnt play by its own rules. Much of what occurs during the climax makes little sense and the supposed ""villain"" a thug named Red (Eddie Marsan) is about as intimidating as a warm cup of butterscotch pudding. Part of the inherent problem with Hancocks structure is the lack of a dramatically viable opponent. Since there isnt one one has to be manufactured on the spot and Red is the unfortunate result. Will Smiths charisma is Hancocks single most important asset. All things being equal we would not like Hancock. But were primed to like Smith. This means that we end up rooting for the anti-hero to become a hero rather than wishing he would be swallowed up in a supernova. Only an actor of Smiths likeability could pull this off. Playing the too-good-to-be-true Ray Jason Bateman is no less charming but a lot less imposing. This is a variation of his Juno persona. Charlize Theron is fine as Mary but the character is mishandled from the beginning and Therons second-billing status exacerbates matters. We know that an actor of her stature and caliber isnt going to play a simple housewife. Because this is Charlize Theron those glances mean a lot more than a playful flirtation (or even an impending affair). Putting her in this movie is tantamount to erecting a blinking neon sign indicating that theres more to Mary than meets the eye. Cast a star of lesser magnitude in the role and Hancock might have been able keep this particular ""twist"" obscured. At the very least it wouldnt have been obvious from the beginning. Despite all the flaws and the frustrating sense that the movie could have offered a lot more than it actually does Hancock is nevertheless a moderately enjoyable experience. Its a glass half-full/half-empty sort of thing. So far this summer has seen a superior superhero movie (Iron Man) a solid one (The Incredible Hulk) and now this. Hancock is the worst of the three but its nowhere near the bottom of the genre. It works a lot better as a comedy/satire than as an action/adventure story but its inability to emphasize the former elements over the latter hamstrings its appeal. An uncertainty about identity becomes not only the heros problem but the movies as well.

Hancock does that and does it well for its first two thirds in which Will Smith plays the superhero as anti-hero. Hancock is a crime fighter so drunken slovenly and sloppy at his job that the citizens of Los Angeles pretty much hate him even as he protects them. And Smith is so gleefully rotten such an unrepentant jerk that you cant blame them. But a jaw-dropping twist while inspired turns out to be what drags the movie down creating an irresolvable situation from which the film never recovers. Its a great conceit the jackass hero who cant quite work out the details. Havent you ever wondered how Superman can fly around and never run into a flock of birds say? Or those crazy chases that inflict massive property damage along the way as buildings cars and whatever else gets in the way are destroyed - how much must that cost? About 9 million for one of Hancocks pursuits we learn in the first scene. It just gets worse for him from there. During a typical cure-is-worse-than-the-disease rescue Hancock saves Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) a public-relations man with a heart of gold from an oncoming train. (The special effects here and everywhere else are spectacular.) Ray is a man with a conscience; his passion project is to get companies to donate their products to the needy a plan that gets him laughed out of most of the corporate offices in LA. He is intent on repaying Hancock so Ray offers to rehabilitate his image. He brings him home to dinner where his son Aaron (Jae Head) is enthralled. His wife Mary (Charlize Theron)? Not so much. She cultivates a well-developed antipathy toward Hancock from the moment she sees him. Rays idea is to allow the authorities to take Hancock out of action (hes wanted for any number of things including all those big-ticket property-damage bills hes on the hook for) watch the crime-rate rise and wait for the city to come begging for his return. So far so good - so very good in fact. Then the story changes dramatically. Mind blowingly. In the moment its a good thing a truly cool development that will surprise and for a time delight. But director Peter Berg has nowhere to go from there. Situations are set up for which there can be no satisfying conclusions - at least not a conclusion that would satisfy the audience for Hancock. Other problems Movies like this must establish rules. The hero can fly have super-strength whatever. But its important to stick by those rules. Granted complaining about the lack of realism in a movie like this is like complaining about the calorie count in an all-you-can-eat pizza buffet. Nevertheless it must never feel like a cheat. Too much of Hancock its internal rules included goes unexplained and unresolved. The explanation for who and what he is for instance rings hollow. Its too slight too underdeveloped. Thats too bad because Smith is great particularly when hes thumbing his nose at life (or downing a half-gallon of liquor). A superhero who calls a fat kid bullying Aaron ""Thickness"" - thats outstanding. Bateman has carved out a nice little movie career for himself by employing the everyman comic rhythms he perfected on Arrested Development a sort of understated bewilderment. Theron is good as well. But they all eventually fall prey to the story which is like Hancock himself a ton of potential but ultimately a mess. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

(PG-13) Columbia (92 min.) Directed by Peter Berg. With Will Smith Charlize Theron Jason Bateman. Opens at midnight shows Tuesday in New Jersey. ONE AND A HALF STARS With great power comes great -- irresponsibility. Thats how Hancock misremembers the superhero credo anyway. He flies drunk tears up public property and remains dedicated to truth justice and half-gallons of Four Roses. And Los Angelenos cant help but wonder Metropolis got Superman. Howd we get stuck with this loser? Thats the hook for ""Hancock"" and its a good one. Until the film meets its Kryptonite -- director Peter Berg. After years of blockbusters the superhero genre has settled into a standard style -- steady nicely framed medium and long shots cleanly cut together and kept clearly visible. Straightforward and slightly formal its a look dictated by the effects as much as anything; its a lot easier to add a flying villain if the rest of the scene isnt moving. Berg however -- whose last film was the similarly manic ""The Kingdom"" -- has thrown out the stylebook. His tripod too. His movie is a mass of shaky close-ups often shot off center and occasionally drifting out of focus. Berg probably thinks it looks like way ""verite."" Instead it just looks like an old Dockers commercial. But with CGI superheroes. Its a fine idea to break style but Bergs choice -- supposedly real and gritty -- doesnt fit his story which is a typical studio script-by-committee. Yes it has more dirty words than usual -- something that Berg mistakes for ""edge."" But it also has less sense with a muddled backstory and a mess of a third act. The storys leaps of logic are a particularly crucial mistake because one of the appeals of superhero fiction is that their fantastic worlds operate according to precise and rational rules. (Its one of the reasons I think why preadolescent boys -- already obsessed with cataloging rocks or stamps or baseball statistics -- respond so deeply to them.) Yet ""Hancock"" has no respect for the form. Theres no real reason for Hancock (hes an angel or a god or I dunno something else maybe). And his struggle for redemption -- which basically comes down to some group therapy and a publicist -- is little more than a fatally unironic gloss on the Hollywood lifestyle. Admitted Will Smith has a good time as Hancock stumbling around unshaven and talking trash to the ungrateful people he saves. Smith has always approached his career with a laserlike focus and clearly the flawed heroes hes played in ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" ""I Am Legend"" and here show a determination to finally if slowly move beyond the positive role model hes played since he was a teen (and the one rapper that parents actually liked). But theres not much to the character and even less to Jason Batemans publicist a supposed ""idealist"" (well he does have a framed Woodstock poster) who tries to remake Hancocks image. Even more wasted is Charlize Theron who -- as if in penance for ""Aeon Flux"" -- shows up here as Batemans wife weeping copious tears. She should. Smith is a cocky but ingratiating guy and as he tirelessly publicized this film last week most entertainment journalists repeated the accepted wisdom that he owns the July 4 box-office weekend -- as proven by ""Independence Day"" and the two ""Men in Black"" films. Curiously those same reporters -- and Smith -- never brought up his disastrous ""Wild Wild West."" Perhaps theyve finally forgotten it. One day I hope to say the same about this. Rating note The film contains a steady stream of vulgarities and comic-book violence. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Superheroes banned from performing their crime-fighting life-saving stunts because of law suits from disgruntled citizens costly damages incurred in the line of rescue accusations that the caped crusader with the X-ray vision was a Peeping Tom?Well the Will Smith title-character in Hancock has the same problem. Heres a guy who can pinky-lift tractor-trailers leap tall buildings in a single bound rocket through the skies and bounce bullets off his chest - basically all that Superman stuff - and yet the public hates him.Hes rude surly indifferent. He ties up traffic. Sure he stops bad guys and saves lives but he destroys millions of dollars worth of city infrastruture and private property in the process. Tossing a beached whale back into the Pacific he accidentally hurls the behemoth straight into an unsuspecting sailboat. Hes a screw-up.And Hancock deftly directed by Peter Berg from a screenplay by Vy Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan - and not based on a comic book but certainly inspired by more than a few - wastes no time in showing the guy at his worst First seen hes curled up on a street bench ringed by empty bottles of cheap whiskey. When a kid tries to wake him to tell him about a high-speed chase on an L.A. freeway Hancock hungover sneers.A rollicking tale of rehabilitation and redemption rife with cool special effects Hancock is smart and surprisingly raunchy (for a PG-13). It boasts yet another terrific turn from Smith. The homegrown superstar (his production company is named Overbrook) brings querulous humor and a palpable pathos to the role of a problem-plagued superhero. When he meets and saves Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) a PR exec whose car gets stuck on a railway crossing Hancock whos led a lonely angry life discovers what friendship family and personal responsibility is all about.If that sounds corny it is - and isnt. Hancock mixes its sappier sentiments and moral uprightness with doses of edgy dark comedy literal and visual profanity and midway through a major major surprise twist. Theres a scene in Embreys house in which Hancock drops in and picks up various kitchen utensils and frying pans thats both a slapstick feat and a slap-in-the-face for anyone who thought they knew where Hancock was heading.Berg the actor-turned-director (Friday Night Lights The Kingdom) has been handed a funny intelligent screenplay that feels like the origin story of a long-lost comic book series. Bateman - whose character is described as ""the Bono of PR"" because of his championing of good causes - plays earnest with an archness thats just right. And Charlize Theron in the role of Embreys wife does much more than merely keep house and tend to the kid. Watch out when she puts on her makeup. Awesome.Hancock succeeds too where The Incredible Hulk and even the whopping great Iron Man let down a bit its CG and visual effects work - the zooming aerial sequences the stopping of an oncoming train the ""parking"" of a gangs getaway car atop Hollywoods landmark Capitol Records building - are supremely well-executed fitting pretty much seamlessly into the fabric of the film. If Hancock has any flaws its in the tricky balance of its darker elements - the guys a suicidal alcoholic after all. But more often than not the filmmakers manage to find just the right tone.Smith the box office boy wonder of the July 4 weekend (Independence Day the Men In Blacks) has long been drawn to stories that address serious issues (poverty in The Pursuit of Happyness eco-apocalypse in I Am Legend). And Hancock for all its superhero hijinks has a weightier side. Its a story about mythic heroes - gods even - and why humankind needs to have them kicking around.Thanks to Smith its a story about movie stars - and why the multiplex-going humankind needs to have them kicking around too.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

"In superhero comedy Hancock weaknesses outweigh strengths - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie review In superhero comedy Hancock weaknesses outweigh strengths Email|Print|Single Page| Text size - + By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / June 30 2008 Look up in the sky Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Oh for Petes sake its Hancock. And hes drunk. Again.Yes Los Angeless unreliable superhero is passed out on a city bench one minute and zooming intoxicated over the freeway to stop Uzi-toting gang-bangers the next. Before he almost kills them he makes a blithe racist remark. Its like ""Lethal Weapon"" all over again with one man doing the job of Mel Gibson and Danny Glover.The idea of a sloshed misanthropic superhero is a good one. The idea of putting him in a comedy is even better. Having Will Smith play the hero? Genius. And maybe some future global blockbuster will find a way to bundle it all into a thrilling work of entertainment.In the meantime theres ""Hancock."" What does one say about a movie that wants laughs from a shot of one inmates head up the derriere of another? Well theres ""ouch."" But theres also ""why?""""Hancock"" which has a batch of sneak previews tonight before opening everywhere tomorrow proudly bills its main character as ""not your average superhero."" By ""average"" the filmmakers presumably mean he is not made of iron or teeming with gamma rays. In other words hes not from the universe of Marvel Comics. If only.M. Night Shyamalans ""Un breakable"" managed to create an original superhero out of Bruce Willis with painstaking wonder. Wonder is whats missing here. ""Hancock"" staggers to the screen from a lousy script that seems written by focus group rather than by Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan the credited typists.With his stubbled wool-hat-and-shorts look Hancock appears virtually homeless. His reputation is in the toilet so cue the down-on-his-luck PR agent (a characteristically droll Jason Bateman) to cajole Hancock into an image rehab. Soon Hancock is voluntarily off to jail (for some stupid sub-""Oz"" business). Then hes released when the LAPD calls. Smith puts on a tight black costume goes lawfully stiff and gives us an amusing flash of how Richard Pryor might have played RoboCop.The movie quickly runs aground when it has to explain itself. A back story is invented that Im not convinced the filmmakers entirely understand. Its easier and more fun to show Hancock launching an obnoxious 12-year-old bully into the clouds or whipping a whale into the ocean than to disclose where the power to do so has come from.Theres the additional headache of what Charlize Theron is doing here. She doesnt figure into much of the films advertising but she plays Batemans wife and for half her scenes shes reduced to badly darting her eyes whenever Hancock is around. If this were a murder-mystery board game Id accuse Ms. Theron in the ballroom with the Oscar.Once she arrives all the obscene snap goes out of Smith and everyones behavior makes even less sense. As a courtesy I wont be terribly specific but the movie suggests a rather incredible racial odyssey. It culminates with an intriguing Hollywood metaphor for Barack Obama and Hillary Clintons endless tussle for the Democratic nomination.The makers of ""Hancock"" had an opportunity to write a cool ticket (movie not presidential). But the film has a depressing lack of imagination. And having Smith play a superhero seems redundant since for years his superpower involved making Hollywood lots of money on the Fourth of July.""Hancock"" probably wont disrupt the trend. Yet once the vulgar comedy dissipates were left with poorly photographed bullet-riddled summer-action mayhem. The only thing drunker than Hancock is the editing and camerawork. Director Peter Berg (""Friday Night Lights"" ""The Kingdom"") has a knack for movies with a bulldozing style. But he usually finds a way to balance the noise with either gags or solemnity. This time his filmmaking is as woozy and gratuitously belligerent as his hero.Berg a former actor also leaves his stars in the lurch. Smith and Theron wear an expression Ive never seen on them before. Its called ""Whats my motivation?"" And obligated to feel something trudging out of the theater I was left in the lurch too.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Theres something for everyone to enjoy in ""Hancock."" For 20 minutes. Will Smiths superhero film offers jokey action fantasy for little boys star-crossed romance for their moms and expensive special effects for teens. Theres gross-out comedy for the mouth-breathers agonizing violence that belies its PG-13 rating for those who like their shootouts bloody and a feel-good ending. But rather than layer its diverse tones and textures into a rich fantasy ""Hancock"" tries one approach for a while then stumbles to the next. Almost any moviegoer should be able to find something to enjoy but its hard to imagine anyone liking this mishmash from beginning to end. The problems start early. Superhero movies work best when we understand the rules of their imaginative universe from the outset. ""Hancocks"" writers keep us in the dark for half the movie making their antiheros motivations unclear. Hancock is a surly SuperDerelict with a drinking problem. (Since bullets dont hurt him but whiskey gives him blackouts and hangovers the extent of his invulnerability is unclear from the outset.) He has superhuman strength but hes an oaf. He doesnt fly as much as lurch through the air as if his internal gyroscope were broken. When hes goaded into assisting the LAPD during a high-speed freeway chase (are L.A. freeways ever this fast-moving?) he causes millions of dollars in collateral destruction. So who is this guy? Everyone seems to know Hancock but nobody knows much about him -- not even Hancock himself thanks to a convenient dose of amnesia. When Ray Embry (Jason Bateman) an idealistic PR man() sets out to rehabilitate the fallen crime fighter he awkwardly asks Hancock to explain key elements of his back story. Is he an alien an angel a deity? We get piecemeal information that is crucial to understanding the antiheros uncouth attitude and alcoholism. An origin story only makes sense to begin at the beginning. Withholding key details until the eleventh hour makes for rickety drama. Late in the game the sideline character of Rays wife Mary (Charlize Theron) leaps onto center stage to provide a sudden burst of romantic tension and clarify the scripts murky superhero mythology. Frank Masi Star Tribune When Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman right) a PR exec trying to clean up Hancocks image brings the disgruntled superhero home his wife Mary (Charlize Theron left) tries to convince him that Hancock is a lost cause in Columbia Pictures Hancock. Hancocks makeover into a popular superhero is the films highlight. Bateman and Smith are splendid in their scenes together an infinitely patient and soft-spoken mentor coaxing a stubborn student. Ray convinces his unwilling protege to enter rehab attend anger-management classes and serve prison time for his destructiveness. He coaches him on saying ""Good job"" to officers on the crime scene even though Hancock protests that he wouldnt be needed if the police did a good job. Ray even persuades him to don a skintight costume like the comic book figures Hancock dismisses as looking ""homo."" Thus prepared he thwarts a bank robbery wins positive media coverage and wins the publics affection. But his troubles have just begun as the mastermind behind the holdup (creepy Eddie Marsan) plots to attack Hancock at his most vulnerable spot.

By David Denby Will Smiths Hancock is a drunken-slob nihilist with supernatural abilities.   Credit THOMAS FUCHS After ""Speed Racer"" ""Iron Man"" ""Indiana Jones"" ""The Incredible Hulk"" and ""Get Smart"" (which is so innocuous that you forget the jokes before you hit the street) it seemed clear that this years big summer movies however spectacular had lost all interest in making even a minimal emotional connection to the moviegoer. But ""Hancock"" starring Will Smith is a surprisingly resonant spectacle that places three people with recognizable feelings in the middle of a wild fantasy. For one thing ""Hancock"" has the grace to acknowledge the audiences increasing impatience with digital wonders. Hancock (Smith) a lonely superhero in Los Angeles cant fly anywhere without making a mess. Carelessly he punches holes in glass-tower office buildings and when he lands on the street in some pleasant suburban neighborhood he tears up the pavement. The public hates him and the Dickensian TV lawyer Nancy Grace of the curling lip and ferocious eye is on his case. Consider this A fellow named Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) is stuck in his car at a railway crossing and Hancock saves him from an oncoming train by putting up his hands and bringing the locomotive to a jolting halt. The trouble is the piled-up cars behind the locomotive jackknife and fall off the tracks. Hancock doesnt mean any harm but hes out of it--a heedless drunken-slob nihilist who just happens to have supernatural abilities. Unlike a comic-book hero he has no ""normal"" placid self; hes always an airborne bum. The grateful Ray however has a scheme for saving him. A good-hearted P.R. man he insists that Hancock ""interface with the public."" He persuades him to wear tight-fitting rubber suits like a proper comic-book hero and to make smiling appearances at West Hollywood clubs. ""Hancock"" was written by Vy Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan directed by Peter Berg (""The Kingdom"") and produced by such shrewd Hollywood talents as Michael Mann Jonathan Mostow and Akiva Goldsman (among others) and like the people who made ""You Dont Mess with the Zohan"" these filmmakers realize that its time to transform digital into meta-digital. If everyone knows that digital has tossed realism overboard then why not turn that knowingness into a joke? Hancock flips an obnoxious neighborhood kid into the sky and looking up now and then carries on a conversation with Ray only to put out an arm and catch the howling towhead as he falls to earth. Thats a pretty funny trick and there are others just as good but when Ray introduces Hancock to his wife Mary (Charlize Theron) the movie adding sexual tension and emotional power to its visual gags reaches a new level. Theron looks at Smith with an uncanny mixture of alarm and attraction. Whats going on with her? He may be a superhero but he smells of booze. Were also puzzled by Bergs visual style which in these intimate scenes depends on a handheld camera restlessly moving yet pinned to the actors in super-tight closeups. Its as if he were making a Cassavetes psychodrama. Suddenly we realize why he stays so close. We are watching genuine actors at work not well-paid hired hands filling up the space between agitated zeroes and ones. For the first time in his life Will Smith doesnt flirt with the audience. He doesnt smile and tease and drawl; he stays in character as a self-hating lonely guy and in Bergs closeups the planes of his face seem massive almost sculpted. Charlize Theron undergoes her own kind of conversion. In such recent movies as ""Monster"" ""North Country"" and ""In the Valley of Elah"" Theron has drawn on rage--perhaps the anger that a beautiful woman feels toward an industry that initially wanted to confine her to decorative roles. In ""Monster"" she covered her face with prosthetics and tattoo ink and in ""Elah"" and parts of ""North Country"" she was severe and drab. But Theron isnt running away from her good looks anymore. Wearing a simple sleeveless red shift her blond hair hanging around her shoulders shes a knockout in ""Hancock"" and she gives the sexiest performance of her career. The currents flowing between her and Smith are reminiscent of the heat generated by Gable and Harlow say or Bogart and Bacall. It turns out that theres a bond between these two (which I wont reveal) and the rest of the movie which includes some superb comic invention as well as scarily turbulent scenes grows out of it. ""Hancock"" suggests new visual directions and emotional tonalities for pop. Its by far the most enjoyable big movie of the summer. The award-winning French thriller ""Tell No One"" is based on an American mystery novel by Harlan Coben that has been transposed to a French setting and halfway through the movie I realized I was very happy that everyone was speaking French. The reason is simple an American version of this material would have had too many explosions and far too much violence in general and it would have been similar to thirty other thrillers made here during the past ten years. But the young director Guillaume Canet working with the screenwriter Philippe Lefebvre has set Cobens material in a realistic social and working world where good-looking intelligent and articulate people find one another interesting. La belle France This emphasis on sociability is not unusual in French commercial filmmaking but its virtually unknown in genre movies made here these days. There is violence--some of it startling all of it significant--but thats not what the movie is about. ""Tell No One"" is devoted to the explication of a single devastating event which we see at the beginning. At a lake deep in the Rambouillet Forest near Paris a happily married couple Dr. Alex Beck (Francois Cluzet) and his social-worker wife Margot (Marie-Josee Croze) celebrate their anniversary by going for a naked swim in the moonlight. After resting on a raft they have a tiny quarrel and Margot swims ashore. Still lying on the raft Alex hears a muffled cry from the woods; he swims frantically but when he climbs out of the water someone clobbers him and he falls back into the lake. The movie then leaps ahead eight years Margot was killed that night; Alex a pediatrician works in a clinic outside Paris. Hes still in mourning still eaten up by what happened--by what he didnt see by what he doesnt know. He can never return to his private Eden the erotic harmony of the forest and the lake but he longs for it nonetheless. Animated and charming with children and their parents Alex in the rest of his life has become a stubborn bitterly reserved man opening up only to his sisters girlfriend played by the English actress Kristin Scott-Thomas (whose French is good). Cluzet a mainstay of French cinema for more than twenty years has thick dark hair and a fleeting physical and spiritual resemblance to Dustin Hoffman. Like Hoffman hes a preternaturally attentive actor who seems to see more than other people do. The dramatic life of ""Tell No One"" is centered in Cluzets eyes. When messages show up on Alexs computer suggesting that Margot may still be alive hes amazed and in a state of bafflement tries to reach her only to run into the police and half the criminal underworld of Paris. ""Tell No One"" jumps all over the place but invariably returns to Alexs need for his wife who it turns out was involved in relationships years ago that he didnt understand. Past events like restless ghouls keep barging into the present and the many mysteries have to be explained in a long confession at the end. We know the material is artificially--even deviously--constructed and we enjoy being manipulated by people who know what theyre doing. But its Cluzets intense performance that makes this genre piece a heart-wrenching experience. Canet commits one major error the little clearing in the forest that Alex and Margot have been visiting since they were children can be entered only between parallel columns of gorgeous pink-orange rhododendron bushes a Disney touch that we see twice and that converts sentiment into a mawkish sanctification of eternal love. Otherwise he moves a talented cast skillfully through a large and varied world. Its a remarkably well-populated movie--fleshed out not just with Alexs family and friends but with a relentless group of high-tech thugs including a female sadist with a long neck and powerful hands which she uses to squeeze her victims in tender places (not the obvious ones). And there is the volatile criminal Bruno (Gilles Lellouche) a lowlife so indebted to Alex for his treatment of Brunos little boy that he becomes a loyal friend and protector--an armed guardian angel. Bounced back and forth between these killers Alex has some unsettling adventures and in small increments learns about the past. Were meant to be a little lost too--tantalized by hints and partial appearances and echoes. Underneath all the mysteries however some powerful forces are at work--the corrupting effects of a great fortune and the love of fathers for children which causes two old men (Jean Rochefort and Andre Dussollier) to do vile things. This is a thriller thats more about discovery than about action. Alexs search for Margot becomes a search for truth. He cant tell the two quests apart and while watching ""Tell No One"" neither can we.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

An intriguing high concept is undermined by low-grade dramaturgy in ""Hancock."" This misguided attempt to wring a novel twist on the superhero genre has a certain whiff of ""The Last Action Hero"" about it with Will Smith playing an indestructible crime-buster in a pointedly real-world context. Although it will inevitably open very large this odd and perplexing aspiring tentpole will provide a real test of Smiths box office invincibility. The central idea of Vy Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligans script -- of Smiths John Hancock being an ornery unwilling hero who escapes from his ordained role in life via booze and general cantankerousness -- is amusing and plausible enough to sustain the first section of the film. What the writers and director Peter Berg do with the concept in the end however is nowhere near sufficiently thought out and narrative illogic and missed opportunities plague the film increasingly as it cartwheels through its surprisingly brief running time. When the world-famous Hancock reluctantly swings into action -- he can fly at supersonic speed lift any weight and is impervious to all weapons -- his drunken recklessness invariably causes more damage than its worth. Although valuable to the police Hancock has a bad name with the public for his destructiveness impudence and all-around bad attitude; an adjunct to this is his foul language which treads the very edge of PG-13 permissiveness and will no doubt catch many July 4 weekend kid-herding parents unhappily unaware. As much in need of rehab as this weeks tabloid celebrity the raggedly attired Hancock finds an eager savior in PR whiz Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman). Rescued from certain death by the rasty hero Ray returns the favor by inviting him to dinner with wife Mary (Charlize Theron) and son Aaron (Jae Head) and announcing hes going to remake Hancocks image. The strongmans first step will be to submit to rehab and anger-management training along with some prison time (although Hancock resists wearing an actual superhero outfit because its too ""homo""). What he shortly does to two tough-talking inmates in the pen crudely literalizes the taunt about sticking your head where the sun dont shine. Such vulgar goofiness is one thing in an Adam Sandler film but doesnt sit well in the rough-and-ready realism of Bergs raw visuals which grievously misapply hand-held jitteriness to material that demands more precise stylization. The genre satire and numerous Will Smith moments with the star throwing off the attitude-laden quips and looks auds expect from him carry the first half without too much trouble in anticipation of where the film will go from there. Where it goes unfortunately is right down the tubes. All along theres something oddly hostile about Marys attitude toward Hancock and at the 55-minute mark a major revelation sends the story veering off into territory that feels unmapped even in the minds of the filmmakers. All the potential the premise seemed to offer is frittered away mind-boggling gaps of logic come to the fore and arbitrary plot devices serve to shortchange a story that could have gone in much more interesting directions. Even in his derelict state why would the presumably super-studly Hancock have no lady friends? Why would humiliated criminals ever think they could strike back at their nemesis? More broadly speaking what about an invincible superhero who could take power into his own hands and become a self-appointed dictator who arbitrates on good and evil sometimes to ill effect? Putting a character like Hancock in the recognizable modern world rather than in a cartoonish context creates all sorts of possibilities that are willfully ignored by the filmmakers who instead have come up with a concoction that is both overwrought and severely undernourished. That said the effects are snazzy even if they pass by quite quickly and theres enough going on to keep audiences watching if not entirely happy. Smith Theron and Bateman capably handle the main roles but such is the skimpiness of the scenario that no further characters make any impact.
