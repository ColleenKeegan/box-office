Actors names are L-R Heather Spearritt Frankie Muniz and Anthony Anderson. Agent Cody Banks gets smart with gadgets in London 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Agent Cody Banks 2 Destination London Family action comedy. Directed by Kevin Allen. With Frankie Muniz Hannah Spearritt and Anthony Anderson. (Rated PG. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Agent Cody Banks 2 Destination London"" is a passable follow-up to last years ""Agent Cody Banks"" a modest hit about the comic adventures of a teenage CIA agent played by Frankie Muniz. The same young teens who cozied up to the first picture will probably enjoy the sequel but it wont win many new fans. Thats because the movie seems like a rehash which may be a sign that the entire adolescent 007 mini-genre is running out of steam. Three ""Spy Kids"" movies have already come and gone and besides the first Cody Banks caper theres been a recent variation on the theme titled ""Catch That Kid"" in which three youngsters pull off a high-tech bank heist. The amiable Muniz (of TVs ""Malcolm in the Middle"") returns in the title role playing a regular suburban kid who has a secret life as a CIA agent trained in martial arts and exotic weaponry. This time Codys off to England (cue lots of London travelogue shots) in pursuit of mind-control software pilfered by a disgruntled CIA officer. The plot is a toss-off like an old ""Get Smart"" episode which doesnt matter at all because the point of the movie is the chase sequences the teen-oriented gags and the silly spy gadgetry (such as an explosive version of a familiar candy mint its brand name repeated several times for good measure). The most enjoyable sequence involves the hasty makeover of the trainees high-tech spy facility into an ordinary summer camp as the kids parents arrive for their annual visit. Its not much but it shows a spark lacking in most of the movie which reminded me of a so-so Disney Channel offering. Speaking of Disney Hilary Duff -- the female lead in the first ""Cody Banks"" picture -- didnt sign on for the sequel but the filmmakers found a look-alike (though shes a couple of years older) in Hannah Spearritt former member of the British pop band S Club 7. (Now for some trivia S Club 7 was put together by Simon Fuller ex-manager of the Spice Girls and the director of ""Cody Banks 2"" is Kevin Allen who acted in the 1997 Spice Girls movie ""Spice World."" Feel free to use this at parties. (More trivia The credits list no fewer than 14 names as executive producer producer or co-producer -- among them Madonna and Jason Alexander -- and Im not even going to try to sort that out.) Muniz is decent as Cody but seems a bit too nice of a guy to be a superspy. Among the supporting cast Anthony Anderson (""Barbershop"") -- a burly foil to the slight Muniz -- has a few lively moments as Codys handler who goes undercover as a chef. (Did somebody say ""food fight""?) So the movies OK in spots but its mostly so familiar that even the young target audience may get that deja vu feeling. Its hard to predict with Hollywood but I wouldnt bet on a ""Cody Banks 3."" -- Advisory Rated PG for action violence and rude humor.

Agent Cody Banks 2 Destination London Movie Review (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/agent-cody-banks-2-destination-london-2004,200,agentcodybanks2destinationlondon7,agentcodybanks2destinationlondon,rogerebert
"In return of Agent Cody Banks Frankie Muniz doesnt age well - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW In return of Agent Cody Banks Frankie Muniz doesnt age well By Janice Page Globe Correspondent  |  March 12 2004 The last time we saw Frankie Muniz as junior CIA agent Cody Banks he was a geeky adolescent out to prove that he could save the world (or at least one hot prep school girl played by Hilary Duff) through a kid-friendly combination of sophisticated spy know-how and disarming immaturity. Unfortunately Agent Codys 2003 debut played like warmed-over ""Spy Kids"" descended from refried James Bond.The good news is that this time around in ""Agent Cody Banks 2 Destination London"" Muniz has better secret-agent toys to play with funnier lines and sidekicks helping him out and a bit more discerning director in Kevin Allen (""The Big Tease"") who may still go in for fart jokes but at least limits the crass humor that director Harald Zwart papered all over the original.Anyway what matters most to the ""Agent Cody Banks"" franchise is Muniz which is the bad news.Even fans of TVs ""Malcolm in the Middle"" know that this child star is rapidly growing up. These days you cant read US Weekly or watch MTV without seeing the 18-year-old actor escorting lithe blondes and getting his Porsche punked out from under him by Ashton Kutcher. In real life Muniz has it seems lost his uncool.Thats a potential problem for a young man playing a dorky junior spy so the makers of ""Agent Cody Banks"" have decided that the sequel will harp on how Cody needs to lighten up and reclaim his childhood. ""Youre too darn old"" remarks professional action sidekick Anthony Anderson. ""Act like a kid Thats why they recruited you.""Ah but acting like a kid is so much easier said than done (see Roberto Benigni in ""Pinocchio""). No matter how adorable you think Muniz is its becoming increasingly hard to buy him as a socially inept teenager/spy whose on-camera mom (Cynthia Stevenson) treats him as though hes still dressing in Garanimals.Problem number two Even if the audience for this sequel is primarily kids too young to care about any of the above the movie still misses its target. At a recent screening little folks found few things to laugh about even when they were dished up humorous references to the 1970s movie ""Convoy"" and an elite pastry program at Compton Community College. Go figure.As for the plot of ""Agent Cody Banks 2"" it begins at Kamp Woody where our aging Boy Wonder has returned for more of the covert CIA training begun in the first movie. Pretty soon hes double-crossed by a former mentor and finds himself assigned to track down the bad guy before mind-control software is implanted in the worlds most powerful leaders. This means posing as a gifted young clarinetist among an international band of musical prodigies visiting a London estate but if the details of that ruse really mattered the movie wouldnt have a ""2"" in its title.Duff has (smartly) moved on to other starring roles so Codys crush in this installment is a bandmate played by Hannah Spearritt. Shes perfectly lovely if a nonfactor in the final analysis.More prominent is Andersons wild-card agent on probation. To give him his due Anderson is a funny guy. But if youve seen him in ""Cradle 2 the Grave"" or ""Kangaroo Jack"" youve seen him here. Unlike Muniz he hasnt grown a bit. Janice Page can be reached at jpage22hotmail.com.

Frankie Muniz tries out his James Bond (or is it Jackie Chan?) moves in Cody Banks 2. MGM Frankie Muniz the likable star of TVs darkly comic Malcolm in the Middle is back as a CIA junior operative a not-so-suave James Bond-in-training. This time his mission takes him overseas where he teams with Derek (Anthony Anderson) an agent whose missteps landed him in exile in London. Banks is sent to there to retrieve a stolen mind-control device that Diaz (Keith Allen) the former CIA training camp director has taken and is determined to use to manipulate world leaders. Banks must pose as a virtuoso musician at a posh academy run by a dedicated music lover (Anna Chancellor) whose husband is one of the villains behind the mind control scheme. Still following this? Cody cant blow his cover (though he has no musical ability) and he must infiltrate the operation spy on his targets and dismantle the device. About the show Agent Cody Banks 2 Destination London   (out of four) Stars Frankie Muniz Anthony Anderson Director Kevin Allen Distributor MGM Rating PG for action violence and some crude humor Opens Friday nationwide Where the first Cody Banks focused on laughs and feats of derring-do this installment gets mired in gadgetry and high-tech devices. Its as if the filmmakers take the junior Bond label too seriously. What was refreshing good fun the first time around feels derivative in this follow-up. There are food fights episodes involving potty humor and perhaps most disappointingly a host of jokes that fall flat. Diaz intones this Apocalypse Now homage ""I just love the smell of summer camp in the evening."" Could there be a more tired line to riff off? Even Muniz doesnt seem to be having much fun. The two Banks share an unattractive quality They traffic in ethnic stereotypes embodied in the first by an Asian driving instructor. Here an Indian girl is lampooned and most of the Brits are portrayed as pompous twits or daft fools. Overall Agent Cody Banks 2 Destination London is simply not worth the trip.

Arriving barely one year after its smarter-than-average predecessor grossed a healthy 48 million domestically (but less than 15 million overseas) sequel which exports its titular hero from Seattle to Blighty is clearly being banked on as a franchise for MGM. The junior James Bond with the ""who me?"" smile returns for a second mildly diverting caper in ""Agent Cody Banks Destination London."" Arriving in theaters barely one year after its smarter-than-average predecessor grossed a healthy 48 million domestically (but less than 15 million overseas) sequel which exports its titular hero from Seattle to Blighty is clearly being banked on as a franchise for MGM. ""Cody"" has audience pretty much to himself until the arrival of Disneys ""Home on the Range"" on April 2. As fans will recall high schooler Cody Banks (Frankie Muniz) was recruited into the elite ranks of the CIA while attending a seemingly ordinary summer camp that was actually a ""junior agent"" training facility in disguise. New pic opens with 16-year-old Cody back at that locale only this time as counselor rather than camper. In a nifty early bit the arrival of parents day occasions the rapid re-assembly of the camps placid facade. After the parents leave the camp is suddenly besieged by helicopters and their unidentified occupants who seem to be after Codys training instructor Diaz (Keith Allen). Thinking that its a drill Cody leaps into action helping Diaz to escape. Later CIA director (Keith David) informs Cody that it wasnt a drill but a legitimate attempt to capture Diaz who has stolen the software for a new mind-control technology. With the help of oily British villain Kenworth (James Faulkner) Diaz intends to use the technology to (what else?) take over the world. So its off to London where Cody poses as a clarinet prodigy in a summer music program run by Kenworths oblivious wife (Anna Chancellor). ""Destination London"" was to have been directed by original helmer Harald Zwart but the Norwegian helmer reportedly left the project after a budget dispute. He was replaced by Welsh director Kevin Allen (""Twin Town"" ""The Big Tease"") but keeps a story credit on pic. Production retains much of the slick muscular appearance of the original and benefits enormously from London locations which serve as frame-filling backdrops for most major scenes. Alas pic lacks any truly signature set pieces to rank alongside the originals terrific baby rescue scene. Awkwardly staged climax monotonously intercuts between a martial arts fight and the music concert thats being used as a decoy. Likewise screenplay credited to three writers (all new) lacks much of the anarchic zing of the first films script. Yet Munizs considerable charm keeps things moving along briskly and theres more than enough here to keep pics target audience engaged. Most conspicuous revision for ""Cody"" volume 2 comes in respect to pics casting. With the exception of Muniz David and cameo appearances by Cynthia Stevenson and Daniel Roebuck (as Banks parents) entire original ensemble is gone including teen icon Hilary Duff. Shes been replaced by delightful blond British newcomer Hannah Spearritt (of U.K. pop band S Club 7 fame). Gone too is the sexy Harmon as Codys adult CIA ""handler"" here replaced with Anthony Anderson as a down-on-his-luck agent who regards his assignment as glorified babysitting duty. Pic manages to credit a whopping 14 producers including such unlikely bedfellows as Madonna and ""Seinfeld"" star Jason Alexander.

Well for starters Cody youve got no charisma no style and mercifully no seduction on your resume. In that way hes got a lot in common with real spies the hollow-eyed android types unencumbered by personality. This time out in Agent Cody Banks 2 Destination London Codys in the U.K. chasing after a mind-control device which might sound nifty to kids who think the Manchurian Candidate is a take-out option. But London itself is so indifferently filmed (and its residents so indifferently stereotyped) it might as well be Toronto. Anthony Anderson does little to help cuffed as he is by the ""handler"" (read Man Friday) role. (Nyuk-nyuk attempts to equate English classism with American racism careen toward the offensive.) At bottom theres just too much spy in young Cody and too little kid. The writers mightve taken (another) page from the ""Spy Kids"" playbook and infused the action with youth relevance - e.g. why not have the mind-control doohickey afflict Cody with snotty Anglophilia and an affected accent? (Producer Madonna could double as dialect coach.) Thats what most kids bring back from England not exploding Mentos.
