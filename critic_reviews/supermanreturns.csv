Comments (1) Superman Returns What could possibly justify making a Superman movie that runs 154 minutes? Plenty of films last longer but their characters are generally sharp enough to recognize a guy with or without his glasses. Director Bryan Singer (X-Men) draws heavily on the 1978 hit that launched the Warner Brothers franchise with Brandon Routh dully impersonating Christopher Reeve as the Man of Steel Kevin Spacey getting all the good lines as the villainous Lex Luthor and stock footage of Marlon Brando proving that death isnt always a good career move. With Kate Bosworth (as Lois Lane) Frank Langella (as Perry White) Parker Posey Eva Marie Saint and Kal Penn. PG-13. By J.R.

That hes a bad tipper? Enjoys golf in his spare time? Fails to signal right turns when exiting a parking ramp? ""Superman Returns"" Bryan Singers serviceable hero update suffers from our universal familiarity with the subject. Sure its been nearly 20 years since the last Man of Steel hit the big screen but we absorb Captain Capes attributes by pop-cultural osmosis. We know his back story his enemies his strengths his weaknesses ... heck we know more about his girlfriends than some of us know about our spouses. So the main point of ""Superman Returns"" is that Singer spends 2 1/2 hours avoiding a franchise-size fumble. The movie works as an action sequel without threatening the high comic-book ground gained by such classics as ""Spider-Man 2"" or ""Batman Begins."" We join Superman for a long ride but what insight did we gain? Other than that the always Christ-like Superman has now formally ascended his theological throne announced here as a ""savior"" and spreading his arms in crucifix form throughout the film. Brandon Routh does his best with an impossible task. The filmmakers appear to have picked him because of a striking resemblance to Christopher Reeve then marketed the film on the false promise that Routh is his own man. Of course well compare the likable bland Routh to the man who donned the blue tights in all four installments from 1978 to 1986. Superman may have been on hiatus but neither he nor Reeve is forgotten. In the movie world of ""Superman Returns"" Clark Kent and his capital S were only away five years. Something about astronomers discovering the remains of planet Krypton and Superman needing to go see his roots however pulverized. When he returns Metropolis teeters on the verge of chaos. Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) takes a dying widows money in a delicious scene then uses the loot to launch his empire-building plan. Worse Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) has married and is raising a son with a new man (James Marsden). Yes thats right theres a son and if you suspect the dreamy little boys paternity then your S doesnt stand for stupid. Many things are done well. Spacey with barely an expression penetrating his arrogant face makes Luthor insufferably cool. Superman saves an airplane full of passengers including Lois rousing our action hopes early. But ""Superman"" she do drag on. An hour into the film we still have no clues about Luthors scheme. The should-we or shouldnt-we confrontations between Lois and Superman make ""The Break-Up"" seem tidy. And havent we covered much of this territory before? Luthor was in three of the four prequels - surely we havent stopped minting new villains. The sexy Luthor sidekick Kitty (Parker Posey) was done once and for all by Valerie Perrine (as Eve) in 1978. Lois writes editorials that win Pulitzers; shouldnt she be blogging? Singer and his writing crew - Dan Harris and Michael Dougherty of ""X-Men"" - touch all the bases without going a step past the bag. We see Jor-El again some rekindled electronic sparks of the late Marlon Brando. We see the crystalline Fortress of Solitude the newspaper the Kansas farmhouse. There is comfort in familiarity certainly but also more than a little fatigue at least this time through. We can always find room for Superman. Each generation rediscovers him like a perfect older brother arriving home from a laudable mission overseas. ""Superman Returns"" just reminds us that when you get back home again the bedroom looks smaller the trophies a little more tarnished. The trick is finding a new story to tell at the dinner table that no one in the family has ever heard.

Its the right song for the occasion. Some of the movies rhythms are extremely jerky though they smooth out as time goes by. (A lot of time 154 minutes in all.) Still this enormous studio enterprise finds a generous measure of heart and even soul in its sprawling sporadically exciting exploration of what has changed here on Earth while Superman was off on a five-year search for his roots in the shattered remains of the planet Krypton. ENLARGE Brandon Routh is Superman in ""Superman Returns"" directed on an epic scale by Bryan Singer. The franchise returns after a much longer absence -- the last Superman film starring Christopher Reeve opened in 1987. Now the granddaddy of superheroes is played by a newcomer Brandon Routh who resembles Reeve eerily (you were expecting a Truman Capote look-alike?) particularly when hes peering out at the world from behind Clark Kents specs. Kate Bosworth is Lois who in the interim has won a Pulitzer Prize. She didnt get it for spelling -- the Daily Planets star reporter asks her editor how many fs there are in ""catastrophic"" -- but for an editorial titled ""Why the World Doesnt Need Superman."" Now that Superman is back Lois is reviewing the situation with romantic longing while Superman suffers from mortal regret flying high above Metropolis in strato-solitude and thinking about a life with Lois that might have been. At one point when they finally get to embrace she says ""I forgot how warm you are."" This is nice to hear but hard to credit since theres no trace of heat between them. Ms. Bosworth is appealing yet her performance lacks a vital spark. Mr. Routh is a personable presence and a physically imposing one but at a few crucial moments his facial features seem to be simultaneously animated as in computer animation and inanimate as in dead. How then to reconcile the blandness at the films center with the warm feelings engendered by the whole? Thats the fascination of ""Superman Returns"" which was directed by Bryan Singer (he did ""The Usual Suspects"" and the first two ""X-Men"" films) from a script by Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris. The production is seriously flawed. Its confusing at first often diffuse much too long and insufferably sententious in explaining why the world needs Superman by likening him to Christ. Yet Mr. Singers film succeeds in so many ways small and large -- most significantly in establishing a sense of epic scale -- that we come to view Superman and Lois with affection as slightly superannuated (not to mention considerably altered) old friends caught up in new adventures of dramatic consequence. How kids will view them is another story -- they dont need Superman even if Lois Lanes world does -- but the spectacle and special effects ought to carry anyones day. (The film is also being released in an IMAX version that includes 20 minutes of 3-D extrapolated from 2-D footage through an impressive if still imperfect new process.) Unfamiliar Faces ""Superman Returns"" heads to theaters with a little-known actor as the star a strategy that may not be all that risky. The standout success is Kevin Spaceys Lex Luthor recently released from prison and bent on doing Superman in so he can carry out a globe-threatening scheme to grow a new continent -- something along the lines of Africa or Australia only privately owned and operated. ""I just want what Prometheus wanted"" he says. ""I just want to bring fire to the people and I want my cut."" While the details of his scheme are murky the indispensable ingredient is a magic crystal that Lex has filched from Supermans cathedral-like -- and stunningly beautiful -- arctic lair. (This crystal is a cosmic equivalent of WD-40 -- good for all sorts of odd jobs including the near-destruction of Metropolis.) What is clear though is Kevin Spaceys ability to take an abstract space in the plot -- a big and important space -- and fill it with an outlandish but concrete villain who is playful one minute and rageful the next; he brings fire to the cast. Lexs raffish accomplice Kitty Kowalski is played by Parker Posey. Shes terrifically funny but theres nowhere near enough of her which is an odd failing in a movie thats more than 21/2 hours long. The same goes for Eva Marie Saint who is seen much too briefly as Supermans adoptive mother. (For the first time since ""On the Waterfront"" shes in a movie with Marlon Brando or at least with his voice haunting snippets of which have been taken from his portrayals of Supermans father in the earlier films.) Another success is the combination of Guy Hendrix Dyass elegant production design and Newton Thomas Sigels cinematography. The camera work is not only up to Mr. Sigels usual standard of excellence as in ""The Usual Suspects"" but almost uniform in quality from scene to scene. Many monster productions these days look ragged their visual unity defeated by industrial logistics. This one is all of a piece and all the more convincing for it. The daunting logistics of ""Superman Returns"" have obviously affected the directors work -- thus the hit-or-miss continuity of the narrative -- but Bryan Singer hasnt been defeated by them. While his movie can be cumbersome its consistently alive and that is saying a lot when many such productions are dead in the water on land or in the air. Also how can you resist the charm of a fantasy in which everyone gets his news from newspapers? Mr. Morgenstern is the Journals film critic.

"Superman Returnsreviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Superman Returnsreviewed. Superman Returnsreviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateSummer MoviesThe joy of blockbusters.June 27 2006 714 PM Man of Stale Superman Returns--now can we send him back? By Dana Stevens Click here to read more from Slates Summer Movies. Superman Returns Is anyone else out there drumming their fingers waiting for the superhero craze to be over? I mean its not impossible. Westerns had their day in the sun and now are revisited mainly as genre curiosities (or when theres something really hip to do with them as in HBOs Deadwood). Musicals came and went as did films about mutant insects turned giant by atomic radiation. But 28 years after Richard Donners Superman The Movie the No. 1 mythical archetype at the box office--with the possible exception of the Italian gangster--is still the dude in a cape with the secret powers and the schleppy everyday life. At this late stage a comic-book-based blockbuster has to be genius on toast to rouse me from my summer slumbers. Both Spider-Man movies managed the trick whether because of the appealing casting of Tobey Maguire or the genuine underdog quality of the Peter Parker character. Somehow Spidey really did seem to be flying by the seat of his red-and-blue unitard making up the whole superhero gig as he went along. But Superman is such a hopeless goody-two-shoes so filial and hardworking and clean-living that awaiting the next installment of his adventures is like looking forward to the Sunday-school picnic. Advertisement In Superman Returns (Warner Bros.) Clark Kent/Kal-El/the Man of Steel (Brandon Routh) returns from a five-year sabbatical from world-saving by landing in his adoptive mothers (Eva Marie Saint) cornfield in a blaze of fire and upthrust crystals. Why did he decide to come back? We never know really but his arrival dovetails nicely with the newly hatched plans of Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) to rule the world by--well the specifics of Luthors plan dont really matter. Like everything else in this movie it involves crystals. Crystals are a world-ruling strategy a means of conveyance and a kind of transhistorical iPod that inserted just so into other crystals allow Luthor to revisit the final words of Jor-El (Marlon Brando) Supermans long-dead father. A clip from the original Donner film has been repurposed here as an interactive home video of sorts in which Jor-El tells his son the story of his origin along with a hell of a lot of information about ... crystals. While Luthor bones up on the whole crystal thing nagged by his shrill moll Kitty (Parker Posey in full-on Cruella de Ville mode) Clark Kent returns to his job as a reporter at the Daily Planet where hes coolly welcomed by Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth). Bosworth is certainly pretty enough to be the object of a super-crush but her broad creamy face admits no ingress. She has none of the neurotic vulnerability of Margot Kidders tightly wound Lois--which would be fine if Bosworth had taken the trouble to reinvent the character. Instead shes banking on decades of comic-book history to make us care We must love Lois because Superman does. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The writers also saddle Lois with a serious moral blind spot in the character of her ""fiance"" Richard (James Marsden) with whom shes raising a child that may or may not be Supermans. I guess by keeping these two unmarried the writers felt they could preserve our respect for Lois as she gives Richard the blatant second-banana treatment even requiring him to pilot the plane that rescues her hero from near-extinction. I guess if your romantic rival is the worlds strongest and nicest person youre supposed to bow out gracefully but I was waiting to see Richard finally blow a gasket. Theres a lot of faintly sexual innuendo about Richards ability to fly a plane versus Supermans ability to well fly. ""Richard takes me up all the time"" Lois informs the Man of Steel. ""Not like this"" he assures her swooping skyward with her nestled in his arms. Point taken. The films most striking repeated effect in which the caped hero dangles dejectedly in space as the Earth turns below him emphasizes the passivity and loneliness of the character This Supermans version of flight seems almost indistinguishable from a helpless freefall. Fair enough but whats he got to be so existentially glum about? I know melancholic superheroes are all the rage at the box office these days but thwarted love painful as it may be hardly seems commensurate with this endless mopey floating. Perhaps the odd advance rumor that this would be the ""gay Superman"" came from an attempt to explain the origin of his cosmic depression. Or maybe all Brandon Routh is mourning up there in the ether is the same thing were thinking down below Hes no Christopher Reeve. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Brandon Routh The young actor doesnt bring much new to the superhero but hes charming as Clark Kent. At some point in Bryan Singers soulful ""Superman Returns"" you just know someones going to say ""Look Up in the sky Its a bird Its a plane"" -- its part of the mythology like Kryptonite and belted red trunks. But the way that dialogue is handled is typical of Singers traditional yet fresh approach to the material. Three people stand around a newsroom photograph pointing at what may or may not be a distant image of the Man of Steel and the lines come out rapid-fire like in a screwball comedy. Its crisp and zingy and feels exactly right as does most of the movie. Singer whos already demonstrated mastery of the superhero genre with the excellent ""X-Men"" and ""X2"" seemed an inspired choice for this long-awaited film. His ""Superman Returns"" taking place five years after the mysterious disappearance of our hero doesnt disappoint; it has a quiet grandeur to it. The retro elegance of its design is often breathtaking; its special effects are state-of-the-art. Though the 1978 ""Superman The Movie"" used as its tagline ""You will believe a man can fly"" its this film that might actually make you believe it -- or at least want to. Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Superman Returns"" with Brandon Routh Kate Bosworth James Marsden Frank Langella Eva Marie Saint Parker Posey Kal Penn Sam Huntington Kevin Spacey. Directed by Bryan Singer from a screenplay by Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris based upon the characters created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster and published by DC Comics. 154 minutes. Rated PG-13 for some intense action violence. At every step ""Superman Returns"" is richly connected to its heros previous screen incarnations. An early line -- a dying elderly woman gasping out the fatal words ""I love you Lex Luthor"" -- is uttered by Noel Neill who played Lois Lane in the 1948 serial ""Superman."" Jack Larson who played reporter Jimmy Olsen in the 1950s television series ""The Adventures of Superman"" has a brief scene. The late Marlon Brando in footage from ""Superman The Movie"" and its 1980 sequel ""Superman II"" plays Jor-El the Man of Steels otherworldly father. And the film is dedicated ""with love and respect"" to the late Christopher Reeve who wore the tights in the 70s and 80s movies and to his late widow Dana Reeve. The story scripted by Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris unfolds upon familiar lines Superman aka Clark Kent returns to Earth -- and to his job at the Daily Planet -- to save the world from the latest diabolical plan hatched by Luthor (Kevin Spacey). And while it never answers the basic lurking question in any Superman story (Why does nobody ever guess that nice-guy Clark is really Superman? Are those ace reporters at the Daily Planet a tad slow on the uptake?) it moves along smoothly with plenty of showstopping scenes. Superman slowly lowers a plane onto a baseball field; lifts the famous Daily Planet globe as if it were made of cotton candy; and takes Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) on a romantic night flight through the Metropolis skies soaring as gently as an angel. (The biblical allusions here with Superman as a messiah sent to save the world are plentiful.) The dark-browed Brandon Routh seems a bit young for the role considering that Supermans been gone for a while and he doesnt bring anything distinctive to his portrayal of the ultimate good guy. But his Clark Kent has a sweet goofiness and hes got a nice chemistry with Bosworth and with little Tristan Leabu the child actor who plays Lois 5-year-old son. (The kids paternity for much of the movie is left mysteriously vague. Hmmm.) Rouths blandness leaves the movie available for stealing which Spacey and Parker Posey (as Luthors foxy henchwoman Kitty Kowalski) achieve nicely. Spacey in particular pounces on his role with glee; hes understated at first but gets increasingly playful as the movie progresses. ""Its Krrrrrrryptonite"" he sings with a happy little trill as he brandishes the emerald-green substance that gives him mastery over Superman; hes diabolically pleased with himself. As recent superhero sagas go ""Superman Returns"" doesnt quite have the perfection of Sam Raimis ""Spider-Man 2"" or the brooding edge of Christopher Nolans ""Batman Begins"" though that may just be a matter of taste. Singers film is earnest perhaps to a fault but so is the guy in the blue tights. ""Superman Returns"" should swoop away with a big chunk of the summer box office and deservedly so.

Image 25 of 25 Superman Returns 1 / 25 Back to Gallery She never could spell worth a darn but Lois Lane has gone and won a Pulitzer - for an editorial headlined ""Why the World Doesnt Need Superman."" Considering Lois ahem history with the Man of Steel this might seem hypocritical but he did fly off without saying goodbye at the end of Superman II. Hes now been absent for five years - he was on the hunt for chunks of his home planet Krypton - and Lois has gone on to other things. Hooked up with a nice boy (James Marsden of X-Men). Had a kid. Won that Pulitzer. Snap on you Superman. The title before us is Superman Returns however so we know what happens. Mr. Hot Pants isnt back long enough to find an apartment in Metropolis (where alter-ego-butterfingers Clark Kent labors at the Daily Planet) when hes called upon to rescue Lois on a jet thats coupled to a malfunctioning space shuttle. Kazooming through the atmosphere Superman handily hefts aside the shuttle and catches the jet before it nosedives into a crowded baseball stadium. The fans roar. As well they should. Superman returns not just to theaters but to form Hes as spiffy and hunky and true as he was when Christopher Reeve first donned the bitty red Speedo in 1978 and if he seems a bit more puppyish than he did then the new look becomes him. Director Bryan Singer -- who helmed the first two superior X-Men -- has found a Reeve look-alike and almost-sound-alike (not quite as nostrily) in Brandon Routh but hes also found and roused the pulse of a fading franchise. Im relieved earlier efforts to update Superman Batman-style into an angstier superhero died because an angsty Superman is no Superman at all; updating him is like trying to bake Twinkies with aspartame. Theres the square jaw. The steel-plate chest. The impermeable black helmet of plasticine hair. Super-de-duper strength super-de-duper ears (to hear the cries of suffering people or short of that office gossip) super-duper eyes to see through walls and crush advancing bullets. He uses this awesome skill set to fight way-bald evildoer Lex Luthor whose scheme to grow a new continent made of Kryptonite should yield much wealth for him and a bad case of dropsy for Superman. Kevin Spacey plays Luthor like hes making love to him his buttery menace wrapped in a Gatsby wardrobe. As Miss Lane Kate Bosworth is less of a tough nut than Margot Kidders proto-Lois who wouldnt have been caught dead eating veggie wraps with the family. But I enjoyed Parker Posey as Lexs dim floozy and Eva Marie Saint in an itty-bitty bit as Clarks human ma. I also enjoyed resurrected clips of the late Marlon Brando as his biological dad Jor-El who correctly asserts ""By now I will have been dead many thousands of your years."" Is this a more modern Superman? Yes its set in the 24/7 global village and the computerized visuals are astounding Superman has never flown so artfully believably or fast. But he hasnt changed from the upright overgrown Boy Scout of yore though his knickers do ride lower on his hips. Singer has made a film that honors its subject to the point of reverence. It may move a little slowly it may dwell a little much on Supermans levitating backlit form and it may criminally waste Kal Penn. But you know what? The boy in blue is back. The world needs him all right and it should welcome his Return. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals GoPlus Racing Style Executive Chair for 80 + free shipping Samsung 65"" Curved 4K Smart TV 400 Dell GC for 1500 + free...

Superman Returns Movie Review (2006) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/superman-returns-2006,200,supermanreturns12,supermanreturns,rogerebert
"As a slow-paced ghost story Return isnt quite dreadful - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW As a slow-paced ghost story Return isnt quite dreadful By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  November 11 2006 One approaches a dinky little thing like ""The Return"" not as a movie but as product and the question isnt whether its good but effective. Will it get high school and college girls happily shrieking and will it allow for socially acceptable date-clutching?The answer is almost. Stronger on spooky atmosphere than narrative sense this PG-13 ghost story starring a near-catatonic Sarah Michelle Gellar stretches its one idea out for a far too long 85 minutes. Gellar plays Joanna Mills a St. Louis woman drawn to the Texas plains of her childhood by unsettling hallucinations she cant shake of a threatening man an eerie woman and a nagging refrain from a Patsy Cline song. Alternately investigating and cowering in fear she meets a brooding loner named Terry (Peter OBrien ) whose own past tragedies have something to do with the otherworldly persecutions being visited on Joanna.""The Return"" aims for a ""Sixth Sense"" mood of dread (punctuated by regular gotcha shots) rather than ladling out the gore so fans of ""Saw"" wont be happy. The scariest thing here may actually be the brief appearance by Sam Shepard  still paying those college tuition bills as Joannas father. Like the landscape itself theres more empty space in the movie than plot to fill it with and sometimes even that fails to make sense such as the unexplained appearance in Texas of a nasty ex-boyfriend (Adam Scott ) who by all rights should still be in St. Louis.As B-level suspensers go though ""The Return"" isnt actively awful -- just slow and cursed with a lead who acts with her T-shirt. The climactic twist when it comes is reasonably satisfying and theres a neat touch at the very very end when the desaturated colors of the modern-day sequences melt gracefully into the full color of the flashbacks. Its the only subtle touch in the movie and it has no business being here.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. His blog is at boston.com/ae/movies/blog.

Superman Returns (   out of four) is a rousing spectacle with a Superman who while daring in most exploits suffers more emotional angst than his predecessors. Though not in the same superb league as last years Batman Begins or 2004s Spiderman 2 Superman Returns is an action-packed saga with exhilarating special effects and dazzling production design. After honing his talents in the superhero genre with the first two X-Men films director Bryan Singer shines with the Man of Steel. As he did with X-Men he brings a depth and an edgy dark quality to the genre that gives it substance and narrative heft. But at 2 hours and 40 minutes it could use some editing. It launches too slowly and deliberately. Once it takes off the story is engaging and the overall look blends classic art deco elements with a cutting-edge futuristic design that works potently. The special effects are splashy the story has an intriguing bittersweet quality at its core and Brandon Routh acquits himself nicely as a more emotionally vulnerable Clark Kent/Superman. Stepping into such an iconic role is not easy considering that the late Christopher Reeve remains for most of us the seminal Superman. Kate Bosworth is a rather lackluster Lois Lane and the romance is less than combustible. Kevin Spaceys comically villainous Lex Luthor is appropriately sneering and sardonic. The film opens with Superman/Clark Kents return to the Kent farm after five years away. What a difference half a decade makes. Luthor is on parole Metropolis is crime-ridden and Lois Lane a star reporter at the Daily Planet is engaged to the editors nephew (James Marsden) and has a young son (Tristan Lake Leabu). But Superman remains smitten with her. And she has won a Pulitzer for an article titled ""Why the World Doesnt Need Superman."" The plot is a bit pedestrian but the struggle between good and evil is not a complex thing. As Superman tells Lois ""You wrote that the world doesnt need a savior. But every day I hear people crying for one."" Superman retains his virtuous messianic impulses. But his heart is not quite as steely as the rest of him in this mostly welcome return. (Opens in many theaters Tuesday; nationwide Wednesday. Rating PG-13 for some intense action violence. Running time 2 hours 40 minutes.)

Clark and Lois are bigger challenges. 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Superman Returns Action adventure. Starring Brandon Routh Kate Bosworth and Kevin Spacey. Directed by Bryan Singer. (PG-13. 154 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Superman Returns"" is the Superman movie for everyone who was sitting around thinking ""I just wish someone would make another Superman movie."" For everyone else the picture has to cross one little threshold of skepticism Why this again? Last year ""Batman Begins"" answered that question by going deeper into the Batman backstory while still delivering a first-rate action movie. But ""Superman Returns"" finds no reason for being other than that its summer and computer graphics have improved since the superhero days of Christopher Reeve. On the plus side there is one flat-out great action sequence near the start of the movie involving a plane full of reporters and the Space Shuttle. There is also Kevin Spacey who as the evil Lex Luthor is even better than his predecessor Gene Hackman. On the downside the movie is 154 minutes of mostly bloat with a new Superman who is just OK (though he looks good) and Kate Bosworth in an unfortunate wig playing Lois Lane as though she took nasty pills. A little secret about Superman Any guy provided that he looks like a black-haired Adonis can play the superhero. So the real deal here is to find someone who can play Clark Kent. One of the fun things about Reeve is the way he made Clark goofy not as though he were really goofy but rather as though Superman were quietly enjoying the spectacle of others underestimating him. Lois (Margot Kidder) felt sorry for him and that seemed to amuse him too. He was like Zorro a man so sure of his own essence that he didnt mind people thinking less of him. But as played by Brandon Routh in ""Superman Returns"" Clark Kent is goofy because he really is a dork. Hes a shy guy. Hes not shy in his Superman incarnation but thats only because Superman is his comfort zone. As Clark he falls apart every time hes around Lois. This isnt funny and it becomes downright uncomfortable when Lois treats him with thinly veiled contempt. At one point Clark refers to their ""relationship"" and she throws the word back in his face as though he were a complete idiot. ""Superman Returns"" was directed by Bryan Singer (""X-Men"") who is attuned to the action potential of the story but his movie has no warmth and Bosworth is a big part of the problem. Its a heck of a thing to say that the intricacies of playing Lois Lane are outside an actress sphere but whatever those intricacies are they elude Bosworth possibly because shes simply too young for the role. She was 22 at the time of filming and her idea of playing a 30-year-old professional woman was to act confrontational and aggrieved and never smile. This is a younger persons naive conception of strength the notion that the path to success is to behave as if the whole world were trying to pick you up in a bar and youre not having it. With the human dimension to the story obviated were left with Lex Luthors diabolical machinations and Spacey makes up for some of the lack of the human element in the rest of the story. In the previous ""Superman"" series the Lex Luthor scenes were often cartoony and tiresome but Spacey -- with his quiet contempt and his aura of self-love -- turns Lex into someone we can understand a loner and an epicure who likes good music (though he never strays from the basic repertory) literature and beautiful surroundings but who cant connect with people. Every so often we look at him and see the distance between Luthors self-image and his reality and he becomes ridiculous and pathetic in the way dictators sometimes are. Spacey is paired with Parker Posey as his moll who is usually as funny as he is but the movie gives her little to do but stand there and look appalled. Actually Spacey is so good that hes almost a problem. Who are you going to root for the intelligent enterprising human being with opera playing on the stereo or this bulked-up space alien whos scared of a pretty girl? Eventually Superman regains our allegiance but the fact that it ever comes into question is a mark of whats missing. Kidder and Reeve always were the most likable people in their ""Superman"" movies. Here Routh comes in a distant second to Spacey and Bosworth isnt in the running. Yet for many in the ""Superman Returns"" target audience to talk about the performances and the interaction of characters is as pointless as talking about what the actors ate for lunch on the set. Its all about visuals and action sequences. Along that line the movie consistently delivers in lots of little ways but in a big way only once in a spectacular sequence that begins with a series of earthquakes and culminates in an airline catastrophe. Lois is on a passenger plane thats careening out of control and Superman has to catch it put out the fire and land it. Its a brilliantly conceived and executed sequence. However the huge set piece for the latter part of the picture in which Lois goes off to rescue Superman is hampered by the movies tepid emotions. An action sequence isnt just about spectacular visions but about making audiences care about those visuals about what they mean for the characters. There ""Superman Returns"" comes up short. -- Advisory Some intense action violence.

Is it a plane? No its ... a mild disappointment Save for later Saved Superman Returns with a whimper in a reverent sincere movie that lacks great characters. By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor June 27 2006 Save for later Saved Twenty years after the last ""Superman"" feature - anybody remember ""Superman IV The Quest for Peace""? - we have a new addition to the franchise. Weighing in at a budget of about 180 million ""Superman Returns"" is a great big and very square superhero movie. After the slapstick of Richard Lesters ""Superman II"" and ""III"" director Bryan Singer has gone back to basics - with mixed results.This approach should not be shocking to anyone who saw Singers ""X-Men"" movies. A traditionalist in the fairly untraditional realm of comic-book movies he doesnt go in for a lot of hoopla or high jinks. His take on ""Superman"" is almost childlike and that is part of its appeal. He takes us back to the time when we read superhero comics as kids and all that crusading idealism could be taken straight undiluted by satire or subversiveness.With the new ""Superman"" what you see is pretty much what you get. While its true that hes a brooder he doesnt go in for the Hamlet-esque contortions that the Batman franchise has been prone to. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? In Singers film which was scripted by Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris Superman returns to Earth after being AWOL for five years. In search of his roots he had been poking around the recently discovered ruins of Krypton. Back in Metropolis he resumes his old job at the Daily Planet as Clark Kent and discovers that Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) has a child and a full-time boyfriend (James Marsden). Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is also back Lets just say that his scheme to rule the planet involves Kryptonite. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Its probably no accident that Supermans five-year absence began in 2001. If I may put a sociological spin on it Superman is a superhero for a post-9/11 world in dire need of one. (One curiosity We are told that he stands for ""truth and justice""; what happened to ""The American Way""?) But Singer doesnt play up the 9/11 angle very much and its just as well. Do we really need Lex Luthor to be a stand-in for Osama bin Laden?Although ""Superman"" is set in the present it has a deliberately retro look. The scenes at the Daily Planet in particular have the feel of 30s hard-boiled newspaper movies and Frank Langellas Perry White is very much in that ""Front Page"" mold. You dont see a whole lot of cellphones in ""Superman.""Lois won a Pulitzer for an essay about why the world doesnt need Superman but clearly she still keeps the flame burning for him. And just who is the father of her boy? (One guess.) Her reunion with Superman is modeled on the first film He lifts her high into the night sky as they swoon over the cityscapes.These flying scenes have always been the hallmark of the ""Superman"" movies and never more so than in this film. As a piece of techno-art its often dazzling. The whoosh of being aloft has a kinesthetic power. At least one sequence a near plane disaster involving Lois and a team of reporters is hair-raisingly good.But if the special effects are often terrific the people are less so starting with Superman himself. Brandon Routh certainly has the right rock-jawed comic-book look but unlike Christopher Reeve who also had the look hes not much of an actor. When he has to show some passion as in his clinches with Lois he resembles a wax dummy that is starting to melt.Bosworths Lois is more animated but also deficient in the passion department. Only Spaceys Luthor has the jollies and wit that this movie cries out for. Parker Posey plays his moll and she too has a few choice moments especially a yucky one involving her pet Pomeranian. After appearing in one of the most expensive movies ever made I guess we can no longer call Posey the Queen of the Indies.Maybe ""The Incredibles"" has spoiled me for superhero movies. The new Superman has its visionary charms but theres only so far you can go without great characters. Grade B Rated PG-13 for some intense action violence.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Gods and Monsters Superman Returns doesnt exactly whiz by and The Devil Wears Prada is rather too petite. By David Edelstein Published ShareThis Meryl Streep dressed as Runway editor-in-chief Miranda Priestly.  (Photo Brigitte Lacombe) From the start Superman Returns has a pall that it never shakes off Even the superheroics seem like stopgap measures in a world slipping grimly into the abyss. Before the credits we learn that Superman has been absent from Earth for five years in a search for survivors from his exploded home planet Kryptonclearly a hopeless quest and when he gets back he spends a lot of time in bed in his mothers house. Marlon Brando appears as Jor-El in footage from 1978 the actor relatively sane and trim at least compared with the barking-mad barrage-balloon hed become The sense of prodigious waste is inescapable. The brassy John Williams theme and the familiar flying credits signal that the series wont be starting from scratch the way Batman didwhich means no matter how good the new guy is well feel the loss of the all-too-human Christopher Reeve. As it turns out the new guy Brandon Routh isnt very good at all and when he is its because hes channeling Reeves dithering butterfingers Clark Kent and his sheepishly grinning Man of Steel. In the first scene an elderly woman expires after leaving her fortune to Lex Luthorand shes played by Noel Neill everyones favorite Lois Lane from the fifties TV show. RIP Lois. To cap off the funereal opening the new Luthor is cinemas most convincing sadist Kevin Spacey. Is Superman being resurrected or buried alive? Theres nothing wrong with tortured emotion in comic-book pictures. The genres writers and illustrators have kept their superheroes fresh by finding dark underbellies and kinky variations. (How about that gay Batgirl?) And ever since the Tim BurtonSam Hamm Batman of 1989 it has been de rigueur in movies to focus on the freaky alienation aspect of the superheros life This is how talented people make movies for 14-year-olds while retaining their self-respect. The director of Superman Returns Bryan Singer mined the gay-outsider subtext in the first two X-Men movies (Have you tried not being a mutant? asked a teens distraught parent) and he must have seemed the perfect guy to give this series the depth and urgency that Sam Raimi brought to Spider-Man. BACKSTORYSuperman Returnswould seem to mark the megaplex return of Kevin Spacey but hes recently said that hes not interested in [having a movie career] at all now (which should please critics of Beyond the Sea). Instead hes committed to London where hes controversially presiding as artistic director of the Old Vic theater. Still he had a blast as Lex Luthor even souping up his on-set golf cart. We tied a Superman doll on the back with a chain so I just dragged it around he told the Website Dark Horizons adding that hed scream into a bullhorn Superman must die Once past the overture theres at least a shred of hope that Singer and the screenwriters Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris are laying the groundwork for a soaring climax. In the Daily Planet newsroom Clark is again an amusingly impotent bystander and these are the best moments in all the Superman sagas the ones where you wait for the doffing of the glasses and loosening of the tie. This time Lois has just won a Pulitzer for an editorial called Why the World Doesnt Need Supermana thinly veiled expression of rage at being abandoned. (The superhero took off for Krypton without telling her or the world.) Could this turn into a comedy of remarriageSuperman and Lois in His Girl Friday? No chance with this Lois Kate Bosworth the blonde surfer-queen of Blue Crush. She isnt a bad actress but shes motorless with guileless little eyes; and the hotshot investigative reporter is now an overprotective single mom with a frail boy and an earnest fiance (James Marsden) whom she doesnt have the wit to manipulate. The bigger problem is that Singers weighty rhythms are disastrous for Superman and the movie actually gets heavier in its last half-hour. Spaceys Luthoruntil now less a supervillain than a clammy businessmanmutilates Superman with sociopathic relish The sequence is so ugly that Luthors lame jokey comeuppance feels monstrously inadequate. But by then the audience has moved far ahead of Singer. A scene in which Lois tries to persuade her fiance to turn his plane around and help the disabled superhero could have been compressed into ten seconds instead of dragged out to a minute and the final scenes would make Wagner check his watch. Its not that the movie is 157 minutes; its that it feels like 157 minutes. Superman Returns has grace notes. The computer artists make Supermans cape billow lyrically and theres a gorgeous moment when Clark uses his X-ray vision to watch Lois lifting off in an elevator. As Luthors moll Parker Posey is splendidly tart although the writers dont seem to be sure if shes dumb or savvy. (Did they change their minds midway through?) In a witty scene one of Luthors thugs joins Loiss son in a piano duet of Heart and Soul while Lois surreptitiously faxes for help. But even here Singer lingers too long. How can you make a superhero movie with no pop pulse? The film of Lauren Weisbergers novel The Devil Wears Pradaa scantily clad revenge memoir of Weisbergers time as Anna Wintours assistant at Vogueis a fairy tale in which the good little aspiring-writer protagonist Andrea (Anne Hathaway) is tempted by the girlie equivalent of George Lucass Dark Side the wicked fashion-obsessed queen (Meryl Streep) of a glossy monthly magazine and her mean shallow minions. Hopelessly ethical and unmaterialistic our heroine nonetheless proves that she can be a triumphant courtier look better in couture than anyone at Vogue (I mean Runway) and retain her commoners integrity.

"Superman Returns | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; superman-returns ) Superman Returns (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli At the end of Superman II the producers promised ""Coming Soon Superman III."" It has taken 26 years for that promise to be fulfilled. To be sure there were movies in the 1980s called Superman III and Superman IV but those were bad jokes masquerading as motion pictures unimaginative stories cashing in on a pay-day. These many years later Bryan Singer has gotten it right. In fact Superman Returns is not only a credit to the first two Superman movies; it may be the best of the series. Its combination of romance and fantasy adventure is unparalleled in superhero comic book-to-movie sagas. What differentiates Superman Returns from the average superhero movie is its focus on the love story between Superman (Brandon Routh) and Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth). If you think Mary Jane and Peter Parker are star crossed theyve got nothing on this couple. Of course the Lois/Superman pairing has never been simple. Clark Kent has always been lurking around. Now there are further complications. With Superman having been away from Earth for the better part of a half-decade Lois has moved on in a big way. She has a son Jason (Tristan Leabu) and a boyfriend Richard (James Marsden) although she resolutely refuses to marry him. Maybe it has something to do with the man of her dreams. Some may not appreciate the amount of screen time devoted to these characters and their romantic interaction but for me it provides balance. Suddenly Superman Returns has more to offer than a megalomaniac seeking world dominion -although it has that as well. When last we saw Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) he was played by Gene Hackman and was off to prison. So like Superman he has been out of the spotlight for a while. Hes ""yesterdays news."" Once free however he is more determined than ever to make his mark on the face of the globe. He visits Supermans Fortress of Solitude and pilfers all the crystals. With these he intends to create a new continent and destroy a few of the old ones in the process. Superman newly returned from a futile outer space search for other survivors from Krypton will (of course) oppose his old nemesis but this time Luthor is ready for him. Revenge is a dish served cold with Kryptonite icing. Supermans return to once again aid mankind may be short-lived. Gone are Christopher Reeve Margot Kidder and Gene Hackman. Its a credit to their replacements that theyre not missed at least within the context of the film. Brandon Routh channels his predecessor although his version of Clark is a little less gawky. Kate Bosworth provides an altogether different take on Lois - a sexier more modern view. Shes prettier than Kidder and theres more chemistry in her scenes with her co-star. Kevin Spaceys Luthor is cut from the same mold as Hackmans except hes more cruel and less flippant. He has his share of one-liners but when it comes down to it he doesnt waste time with drawn-out monologues. Thats when hes at his most brutal. There are no miscasts to be found in the supporting cast either. Parker Poseys Kitty fills the function of Miss Teschmacher - Luthors female stooge who has a soft spot for the Man of Steel. James Marsden following director Bryan Singer to Metropolis from Professor Xs school has the tricky role of playing the foil in Lois and Supermans romance without coming across as a jerk. Richard is a nice guy. Eva Marie Saint plays Clarks Earth mother who gets to find her son and almost lose him again. The only returning cast member from the original Superman is Marlon Brando with archival footage recreating his limited part as Jor-El Supermans biological father. For those who go to superhero movies for the action rest assured theres plenty of that. While the extended climactic sequence is the movies longest and most involved I was partial to the rescue of a space shuttle and airplane which heralds the Man of Steels return to his adopted planet. Its a great moment filled with tension and topped off with top-notch special effects. Visually Superman Returns offers the kind of upgrade one would expect after a quarter century layoff. This time you really believe a man can fly. Composer John Ottman puts his ego aside and gives John Williams original music plenty of play. Singer provides us with a blast from the past with opening credits. Not only is the music 100% Williams but the lettering nearly replicates that which was used in Superman and Superman II. There are other unobtrusive homages to the first two films from Lois spelling faux pas to Luthors love of maps. Singer may not be a fan of the Superman comic books but his affection for and knowledge of what Richard Donner brought to the screen is evident. Superman Returns clocks in at a fat 157 minutes but I hardly noticed the passage of time. The movie had me enthralled from opening to closing. One could easily argue that Singer used his time in the X-Men universe as an opportunity to hone his superhero movie skills. Superman Returns is near the top - if not at the top - of the superhero movie pile. It offers nearly everything romance action humor and plenty of goose bumps. For Superman many happy returns.

Superman it seems has been off-planet finding himself for five years which means he took his eye off the ball of human affairs in summer 2001. You might have noticed things going a little screwy since then and on his return the Man of Steel does indeed have his work cut out - not tackling violently politicised religious extremism mind but alien crystals that grow really really big when submerged in water. So big in fact that Lex Luthor - for it is he whos plotting the submersion - anticipates the displacement of the western world by a whole new continent on which he will house its refugee remnants at a hefty mark-up. (Estate agency like cockroaches will survive the apocalypse.) As if this werent a bad enough welcome back Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) has acquired a new fella a young son and a Pulitzer-winning line in superphobic diatribes. Whats a hero to do?Stick to what he knows of course which is pretty much what Bryan Singer (X-Men) has done too delivering a mildly souped-up adventure firmly in step with Richard Donners 1978 movie and its first sequel. From the use of leftover Brando footage to Brandon Rouths utterly Reeve-ish central turn the swooping 3D credits to John Williams fanfare score Kevin Spaceys grounchily grandiloquent Luthor to his banal unfunny cohorts (including a wasted Parker Posey) Superman Returns doesnt so much reinvent the franchise as worshipfully revisit it. Theres a touch more private angst as is de rigueur these days but the relationship stuff is worn fairly lightly (even lighter might have been better more frisky sparring would have matched the cod-30s feel of the Daily Planet newsroom). Crucially the film delivers as action spectacle with a passenger jet rescue Metropolis-wide shockwave and Titanic-style nautical jeopardy playing out against vistas of space city ocean and ice. Its straight-faced square-jawed stuff but thats apt enough for the boldest simplest superhero concept of all.

Not only is she wrong in the context of the story but shell be wrong in the court of public opinion once the world gets a look at this saga. ""Why the World Doesnt Need Superman"" reads the title of a piece that wins Lois Lane the Pulitzer Prize in ""Superman Returns"" the latest bigscreen revival of comicdoms strongest and fastest hero. Not only is she wrong in the context of the story (not to mention real life) but shell be wrong in the court of public opinion once the world gets a look at this most grandly conceived and sensitively drawn Superman saga. Sure to rate with aficionados alongside ""Spider-Man 2"" and for many ""Batman Begins"" on the short list of best superhero spectaculars pic more than justifies director Bryan Singers decision to jump ship from the ""X-Men"" franchise and will pull down stratospheric B.O. around the globe. What is it about the current climate that has produced three major releases within a months time that hinge on the hitherto unsuspected offspring of legendarily childless figures -- Jesus in ""The Da Vinci Code"" Satan in ""The Omen"" and the title character here? Its an odd development although it does provide a promising springboard for future series entries something not enjoyed by the three increasingly dispiriting sequels to Richard Donners entertaining Christopher Reeve starrer. New version tips its hat to the 1978 picture in numerous ways; its dedicated to Reeve and wife Dana; it recycles John Williams main musical theme; Marlon Brando once again appears albeit mostly vocally as Supermans father; and newcomer Brandon Routh bears a conspicuous resemblance to Reeve. Nonetheless Singer imprints his handiwork with its own personality. Despite its acute awareness of whats come before ""Superman Returns"" is never self-consciously hip ironic post-modern or camp. To the contrary its quite sincere with an artistic elegance and a genuine emotional investment in the material that creates renewed engagement in these long-familiar characters and a well-earned payoff after 21/2 hours spent with them. After an opening credits sequence devoted to an explosive illustration of the tremendous energy forces in deepest outer space screenplay by Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris (""X2 X-Men United"") returns Superman briefly to the farm where he was raised (memory flashbacks neatly recall his learning to fly) after a five-year absence. Soon turning up in Clark Kent guise at the Daily Planet to reclaim his old job hes nonplussed when he learns his beloved Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) has a son Jason (Tristan Lake Leabu) and a good-looking significant other Richard White (James Marsden) the editors nephew and has made her name as banner-carrier for the anti-Superman lobby. But the Man of Steel nonetheless proves hes worth having around. Old nemesis Lex Luthor (a shaven-headed Kevin Spacey) is up to no good again harnessing power from a perfect crystal and announcing his return by causing power outages and creating mayhem on an intended airborne space shuttle launch (yes thats Richard Branson on the shuttle crew) that sends the plane carrying the shuttle and reporters including Lois out of control. Arriving a half-hour in sequence is a doozy as the burning jet eventually plummets straight for the ground (unavoidable shades of ""United 93"") until being gently stopped at the last second by the Caped One. As far as the public is concerned Superman has made a triumphant return. But Lois remains unimpressed to the point that a rebuffed Superman takes a lonely flight to Lois waterfront home (with its gorgeous view of Metropolis) in order to use his X-ray abilities to eavesdrop on her seemingly enviable family life. Sequence and all that comes after renders rubbish all the uninformed pre-release media stories about a gay Superman as what Singer and his writers are offering here is an elaboration on the theme of Superman (or most any superhero) as an outsider. Brandos Jor-El is heard to tell his son (in dialogue from the Donner version) that hell always be ""different"" an ""outcast"" who can pass as a human being but will never truly be one. For quite some time Lois maintains her resistance to Superman while he cant help but do what he does best -- save the day for those in dire jeopardy (in a truly internationalist although markedly nonpolitical spirit as TV news reports testify). Pushed by editor Perry White (Frank Langella) to get an interview with her old flame Lois finally meets him on the roof of the Daily Planets splendidly retro office building whereupon Superman takes her on a nocturnal flight that beats Howard Hughes airborne date with Katharine Hepburn in ""The Aviator"" any day. By this point it is clear Singers take on the impossible love between the two has nothing to do with the old joke that Lois doesnt see the resemblance between Superman and Clark Kent (something picked up on quickly by her son) or the problems of finding a place to change into tights and cape but perhaps quite a bit to do with themes of loss and the tragedy of fate as classically expressed in opera or ballet. There are dramatic passages where in another context one could easily imagine any of the three leading characters breaking out into arias of regret confession desire or intent just as Supermans incredibly graceful and often slow vertical ascents and landings as well as his moments of reflective isolation create the frissons of expressive dance movements. Topping off these aspects is the evocative darkly lyrical score by John Ottman continuing in his unique dual role for Singer as composer and editor (with Elliot Graham). The sometimes ethereal qualities of Ottmans work amplified by significant choral strains provide an emotional dimension -- and show up Williams ""Star Wars"" thematic variation for the bombast it is. Luthors dastardly plans involve kidnapping Lois and her son aboard his sleek boat giving Spacey a big scene in which he can really rock and roll with some very choice line readings. The villain really does seem to have Superman on the ropes at one point but after a somewhat distended final stretch the real climax comes in a touching scene between Superman and little Jason who may or may not be super himself. Regular Singer cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel has contributed significantly to giving the film a fantastically clear clean and stable look; ""Superman Returns"" is an unalloyed pleasure simply to behold. Production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas and costume designer Louise Mingenbach have anchored their work in the 50s -- an old-fashioned newsroom with modern accoutrements coats and ties for the men sharp professional wear for Lois and other women -- but without any cloying self-consciousness. Visual effects are super throughout. One can praise newcomer Routh very highly indeed simply by saying that he carries this giant film with apparent effortlessness. Thesp possesses a winning appealing personality that nicely complements his rangy black-haired blue-eyed good looks. Parker Posey has a bit of a field day playing Lex Luthors sassy floozy. The only semi-disappointment in the cast is Bosworth. First off she seems too young to have been working for the newspaper for more than five years and to plausibly have had her kid for the same length of time. More significantly she comes off as flinty and cold for too long denying Lois a beating heart beneath the brusquely professional m.o. You never get a strong sense of the woman inside the newshound with an unrivaled inside connection to the most famous man in the world.
