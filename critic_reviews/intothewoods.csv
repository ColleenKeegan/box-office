Could a Disneyfied version of Into the Woods make sense or would the two opposing ideologies cancel each other out leaving a handful of songs a quartet of griping characters and none of the insight?Luckily theres history when it comes to Disney sanitizing the darker corners of the Grimm Brothers psyche. The 1950 animated adaptation of Cinderella might feature an infestation of friendly vermin but the Wicked Stepmother doesnt force her two daughters to cut off parts of their feet in order to fit the golden slipper nor do Cinderellas swarm of doves blind her sisters by pecking out their eyes during a wedding. Sondheim however keeps the gruesome parts of the original story and so does Marshall whose Woods to his credit are as thorny and treacherous as could be hoped for in a PG-rated production. Cinematographer Dion Beebe who previously worked with Marshall on Nine and Memoirs of a Geisha conjures a barren forbidding locale for the characters to venture into but as the story unfolds it becomes clear that the scariest things lurking in the woods are their own unspoken desires.Related Story Grimms Fairy Tales Pandering to Humanitys Worst Desires Since 1812 Right from the outset Into the Woods gently pokes holes in the fairy-tale imperative of dreams and schemes with each character listing their wishes in the prologue. The Baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt) yearn for a child; Cinderella (Anna Kendrick) wants to go to a festival at the palace like the rest of her brutish family; poverty-stricken Jack (Daniel Huttlestone) and his mother (Tracey Ullman) wish that their cow would give them some milk; and Little Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford) desires a loaf of bread to take to her grandmother in the woods but also a sticky bun (or four). The Baker and his Wife have been cursed by a Witch (Meryl Streep) after his father stole vegetables from her garden many years ago a crime that resulted in the Witchs wizened appearance. The Witch also stole the Bakers sister in infancy raising her in a tower without doors where the only form of access comes via the prisoners hair (the child Rapunzel is played by Mackenzie Mauzy).To lift the curse the Witch orders the Baker and his Wife to find a cow as white as milk a cape as red as blood a hair as yellow as corn and a slipper as pure as gold and bring them to her within three days. Each object is a challenge but also an irreplaceable part of a characters lore Cinderellas slipper Rapunzels hair Little Red Riding Hoods cape and Jacks cow. Like Sondheim stripping stories into their component parts and reassembling them into his story the Baker and his Wife pursue the four items as the separate tales unfold. Kendricks wistful understated Cinderella enlists the help of birds to complete a challenge given to her by her stepmother (Christine Baranski) and makes a wish at her mothers grave after which shes magically clothed in finery from head to toe. The Bakers wife trades Jack his cow for a handful of beans telling him that theyre magic (which inevitably they are) and Jack climbs a beanstalk and returns with armfuls of gold. A prince (Billy Magnussen) hears Rapunzel singing and falls in love with her leading her to resent her isolation and a Wolf (Johnny Depp) entreats Little Red to stray from her path further into the woods before eating her.The Wolfs consumption of Little Red Riding Hood is very much allegorical.Among all the anxiety over a family-friendly adaptation of Into the Woods one of the most problematic elements is the Wolf whose consumption of Little Red Riding Hood is very much allegorical. ""Look at that flesh pink and plump hello little girl"" the Wolf sings musing over the ""scrumptious carnality"" of having both grandmother and Little Red for dinner on the same day. Originally YouTube star Sophia Grace Brownlee was reportedly cast in the role but her age (eight at the time) paired with the Wolfs overtly sexual pursuit of his prey was deemed troubling. Lilla Crawford who played the title role in Annie on Broadway in 2012 is a teenager and gives the character a more plausible curiosity as well as a notable shift in maturity after shes rescued from the belly of the beast. Still Depps Wolf is carnivorous in more ways than one. ""And what might be in your basket?"" he asks Little Red as he ogles her midsection one eyebrow raised. Its the kind of double entendre younger viewers will miss but its enough for adults to infer the subtext in the loss of Little Reds innocence. ""He made me feel excited--well excited and scared"" she sings to the Baker in ""I Know Things Now."" ""Isnt it nice to know a lot? And a little bit ... not.""School productions of Into the Woods often stage the first act which culminates in a happy ending for all and skip the second which follows the characters into the more realistic aftermath of having all their dreams come true. Marshall thankfully doesnt but without an intermission the film loses some momentum in its second darker hour. The Witch is transformed back to her spectacular Oscar-ready self but she loses her ability to do magic. The Baker and his Wife have a child but theyre still wishing for more (a bigger house for the Baker to hold his baby which he seems to fear). Kendrick admirably conveys Cinderellas ambivalence to the Prince throughout his pursuit of her meaning that their marriage feels unsatisfactory before it even begins and becomes even more so. Meanwhile a magic bean is discarded in the woods allowing another giant (a woefully underused Frances de la Tour) is able to come down to earth and seek revenge on Jack for killing her husband.Its in this second act that Sondheim seems to make a case for moral ambiguity but Marshall doesnt so much probe the limitations of categorizing things as good and evil as he attempts to tie up loose ends in a sadder wiser bow. Still the stellar ensemble cast finds nuance in the intricacies of Lapines screenplay. Corden is particularly intriguing when he confronts the terrors of parenthood a subject also wrangled gorgeously by Streeps Witch in ""Stay With Me"" (when she pleads with Rapunzel not to grow up and leave her) and in the closing number ""Children Will Listen."" ""Princes wait there in the world its true"" she croons tender and vulnerable. ""Princes yes but wolves and humans too."" Its a virtuoso encapsulation of the love sadness joy rage and fear involved in sending children out into the world and one of the most exceptional vocal performances in the film.As a family-friendly holiday crowdpleaser and faithful adaptation Into the Woods is mostly golden.As the Bakers Wife Blunt is similarly adept faced with tackling an immensely practical character who struggles when confronted with fantasy made real. While she and Kendrick deliver gracefully understated and thoughtful performances Cinderellas Prince (Chris Pine) is gloriously madly over-the-top oozing panache from every pore. ""I was made to be charming not sincere"" he tells Cinderella and his duet with Rapunzels Prince (Magnussen) ""Agony"" is a breast-beating hair-tearing lesson in melodrama. The only weak link is Huttlestone as Jack who seems too young for the role and whose lines get lost in delivery. When he sings about a ""big tall terrible lady giant ... and she gives you food and she gives you rest and she draws you close to her giant breast and you know things now that you never knew before"" the insinuation of what exactly hes learned up in the sky is either lost or downright creepy.Still when it comes to navigating how to be both a family-friendly holiday crowdpleaser and a faithful adaptation of a tricky but profound musical Into the Woods is mostly golden. It has gorgeous sugar-spun spectacle and bleak terrifying landscapes; brilliantly refined performances cut with just the right amount of pageantry; familiar archetypal characters and conflict thats both modern and ageless. Perhaps it doesnt delve quite as deeply into the philosophical conundrums within our favorite stories as the musical does but it doesnt ignore them either. ""Must it all be either less or more plain or grand?"" the Bakers Wife asks after a particularly out-of-character moment in the woods. ""Is it always or is it never and?"" In this case for once it isnt necessary to choose.

Twitter previousUnbowed Unbent Unbroken The Emptiness of Pure EndurancenextA Very Tamale Non-Christmas Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Lucy Nicholson / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 65 Id Like to Hear His Wife Say Something James Fallows None The most personally moving and most fundamentally patriotic moment of the Democratic National Convention was the appearance by the bereaved parents of Army Captain Humayun Khan and the statement about the meaning of their sons life and death and about the Constitution by Mr. Khizr Khan. After Khizr Khan spoke politicians and commentators on most networks said they were moved humbled inspired choked up. (Commentators on Fox did not say these things because their coverage cut away from the Khans for Brit Hume and Megyn Kelly plus a Benghazi ad.) Continue Reading Stephanie Loos/Reuters The Elusive Manipulative Adopted Child Tina Traster Learning how to bond with my daughter who found comfort in the familiarity of being alone has come through understanding reactive attachment disorder. My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Gary Cameron / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 62 A Man Who Can Be Baited With a Tweet James Fallows None Last night in her overall very successful acceptance speech Hillary Clinton said with ruthless precision about her opponent Ask yourself Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

Its January at the Cineplex but you didnt think you were getting off easy this month with Taken 3 and Mortdecai right? Heck no Not when were hot off the 2015 Oscar nominations announcement. As of now the clock is ticking to catch up on all the films and performances youve been putting off since Christmas break. (No judgments if you downloaded The Interview and laughed at the Kim Jong-Un buttonhole jokes instead of sitting through A Most Violent Year. Apparently youre not alone.) Start with these five newly released dramas. Oh and you might want to check out Boyhood too. PHOTOS Oscars PDA 1. American Sniper3 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars)Oscar nominations Best Picture Best Actor (Bradley Cooper) Best Adapted Screenplay Best Film Editing Best Sound Mixing Best Sound Editing It grips from the very first scene when a sniper sits on a roof in Afghanistan and must decide whether to pull the trigger on a child holding a bomb. His name is Chris Kyle and hes played with brooding intensity by a never-better Bradley Cooper. The true story depicts how the taciturn and beefy Texan who served four tours of duty as a Navy SEAL became the deadliest shooter in American history. All the while he struggles to maintain a staid domestic life with his wife (Sienna Miller) and two kids. Director Clint Eastwood deftly shows the mental and physical toll of heroism in a way that will leave you gutted. PHOTOS Best dressed at the Oscars last year 2. Selma3 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars)Oscar nominations Best Picture Best Original Song Films dont get more powerful than this effort from Ava DuVernay. Her civil rights drama closes in on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (a magnificent David Oyelowo whose Best Actor snub mystifies) as he leads a march from Alabamas Selma to the state capital in 1965 to peacefully protest voting inequalities. In a bold and refreshing move the iconic reverend is portrayed as both a dignified hero who can sway a room with an eloquent speech and a philandering husband who takes out the garbage. Needless to say his message has never been more relevant. David Oyelowo in Selma Atsushi Nishijima PHOTOS Oscars 2014 - Best picture nominees 3.

The actor a master at inhabiting emotionally chilly geniuses plays renowned British mathematician Alan Turing. During World War II he builds a code-cracking machine that can decrypt Nazi messages. But the socially awkward Alan is crippled by a secret Hes gay and is so desperate to stay closeted that he proposes to a colleague (Keira Knightley). Sadly his sexuality will be his undoing in later years. Get past the biopics old-fashioned narrative and youll find a moving tribute to an extraordinary man. Benedict Cumberbatch in The Imitation Game Jack English/Weinstein Company 4. Still Alice3 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars)Oscar nomination Best Actress (Julianne Moore) Theres a difference between a great performance and a Great Performance. Julianne Moores turn as a linguistics professor afflicted with early onset Alzheimers easily qualifies as the latter. Shes Alice who just after her 50th birthday gets alarmed when she starts blanking on familiar names and words. (""Its like my brain is falling out from under me"" she haltingly explains to her husband played by Alec Baldwin.) Though her family struggles to accept the diagnosis nobody is more distraught than Alice herself. Inch by inch her condition deteriorates and Moore is able to subtly convey all the panic and frustration with just a look on her face. This poignant film doesnt sugarcoat a thing yet its still beautifully done. Julianne Moore in Still Alice Linda Kallerus Courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics PHOTOS Best Oscars beauty looks 5. Into the Woods3 stars (out of 4 stars)Oscar nomination Best Supporting Actress (Meryl Streep) Best Costume Design Best Production Design Anna Kendrick as Cinderella Chris Pine as Prince Charming Emily Blunt as the Bakers Wife and the inimitable Meryl Streep as the wicked witch. What a treat to watch stars take on these classic characters in this lush adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim musical. These familiar icons (and more) go into the woods to seek their fortunes and become pawns in the witchs spell. Streep as always stands out in a forest-chewing role -- though her onetime Devil Wears Prada underling Blunt (herself a Golden Globe nominee) does some beguiling work as well.

Comments (8) click to enlarge Into the Woods Video Rated PG  124 minutes  2014 Stephen Sondheim and James Lapines stage musical in which modern anxieties about sex and death descend upon classic fairy tale characters is a caustic parable about the illusory nature of childhood innocence so the idea of a cleaned-up kid-friendly Disney adaption sounds misguided at best. Taken on its own terms it isnt terrible; Rob Marshall who previously directed the neutered movie version of Bob Fosses Chicago has an undeniable talent for directing musical numbers and the production design effectively re-creates the look of classic Disney animations. But with the exception of Meryl Streep (as the Witch) and James Corden (as the Baker) the cast is bland and the bombastic orchestrations tend to steamroll the nuances of Sondheims score. If you want to see Into the Woods done right track down the American Playhouse presentation of the 1987 Broadway production which is far funnier scarier and more heartfelt than this.

Into the Woods the 1987 fairytale mash-up musical by Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine has fallen under Disneys spell getting the lavish big-screen treatment courtesy of Chicago director Rob Marshall. Its unspectacular but fun and perfectly in line with Disneys current thing for reimagining fairytales (next up Cinderella in March). Meryl Streep continues her finest-actress-of-her-generation-behaving-badly streak by playing The Witch who casts a spell of childlessness on the village baker and his wife. To break the curse the couple must bring her Rapunzels golden hair Little Red Riding Hoods cape Cinderellas slipper and a white cow belonging to Jack (of beanstalk fame). Streep must have watched Tangled on repeat channelling Mother Gothels pissed-off hippie mom routine. Its a tongue-in-cheek performance but the favourite for this years Oscar for Best Fairytale Evil Bitch must be Angelina Jolie and her killer cheekbones in Maleficent. Elsewhere casting-wise the only grumble is that its all a bit obvious. Anna Kendrick brings her all-round awesomeness to Cinderella. As The Wolf Johnny Depp is creepy as only Johnny Depp can be. Emily Blunt is spot-on as the bakers wife. The only surprise is James Corden - the most unlikely Brit actor to have a Hollywood moment ever - playing the heart-of-gold baker. Into the Woods starts better than it finishes but its a great-looking film with a nicely old-school easy-on-the-CG feel. Marshall neatly balances the comedy with a few thorns - witness Cinderellas mean stepsisters (fabulously dressed in couture vixen goth frocks) getting their eyes pecked out by birds. And so much for happy endings for everyone one character is flattened by a giant. Still there are no earworms youll be humming for weeks just a hilarious number sung by Prince Charming played brilliantly by Chris Pine as a camp feather-brained lunkhead. The look of sheer dumbfounded confusion when Cinders runs away from him is priceless. And he gets the best line I was raised to be charming not sincere.

Still I had doubts about this film after reading how Disney requested to have certain parts to be a bit softened (such us the small role by Johnny Depp who sings a song that originally was far more explicit and sounded even more paedophile than it already is) but I ended up enjoying the film. At least for the first part of it. When the second part starts all the fairy tale bits disappear and a more realistic world is set on the same scenario where characters show a more realistic character that shows that happy endings dont usually happen in real life.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 11 2015Anthony CFeaturedOh dear. What a long dreary evening. Lots of big names bashing out big but uninteresting songs with a plotline that left me stone cold. Lots of self-congratulatory comments from those around me when it finished about how glad they had seen it and ""isnt Sondheim amazing?"" . Well I am sorry. No. The whole contrived mess made me wish I had taken a punt on the screen next door.

"Kitsch and a Witch Tim Burtons Big Eyes and the Movie Musical Into the Woods << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Kitsch and a Witch Tim Burtons Big Eyes and the Movie Musical Into the Woods The Weinstein Company Movies December 23 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Big Eyes is Tim Burton pretending to be ordinary. Its a small dramatic comedy of sorts. Its got a decent script from Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski (they wrote Burtons Ed Wood) an approachable concept and it didnt cost 250 million. The movie is set in an actual city -- beat-era San Francisco. The houses and restaurants and galleries are all life-size. But the movie slips into Burton-esque derangement anyway. All the plain surfaces start to turn sideways the instant Walter Keane (Christoph Waltz) walks up to Margaret Ulbrich (Amy Adams in a blond wig) in 1955 and then makes her Mrs. Keane. They meet in the park where each is selling paintings. Shes with her daughter doing her big eyes. He does generic street scenes. You know somethings off when you see Waltz in Breton stripes and a beret. He looks like a mime on the lam. More Awards SeasonAll of our Oscar coverage The movie is based on the true story of how for years Walter took credit for Margarets popular kitsch paintings mostly of big-eyed children until she took him to court. Walters day job is real estate. Hes supposed to be the sort of con artist who can easily seduce. Within two or three scenes hes won over Margaret a divorcee and single mother from the South whos new to San Francisco. Her girlfriend DeeAnn (Krysten Ritter) smells a rat but Margaret goes with it. Walter tries to show their paintings but he fails to get a gallery to take them. ""Clear out the gutter before the taste police arrive"" jokes the aggrieved owner (Jason Schwartzman). So she and Walter hang them in a nightclub. The owner (Jon Polito) puts them near the bathroom. One night a woman gets her man to buy one of the big-eye paintings (she responds to the sadness in them) and gradually the paintings go from a thing to the thing. And right before they take off theres a moment when someone in the club asks Walter and Margaret who the artist is and Walter steps forward and claims credit. Having one of Margarets paintings seem to stare back at her is a nice touch. Shows ensue and to the horror of Schwartzmans gallery owner theres a lot of interest. But its not until Walter has the idea of selling posters that the big eyes really take off. The marriage meanwhile veers into a kind of passive abuse. He gallivants around the gallery chatting everyone up while Margaret stands more or less alone smiling through her bewilderment. Eventually the money rolls in and they move to a big new house where she becomes a kind of sweatshop captive toiling away in a private studio that her daughter is never to enter. Margarets bitterness (or Adamss breathy rendition of it) keeps her from being pathetic. When Walter realizes he needs a story for the paintings Margaret quips ""Looks like you painted yourself into a corner."" He comes up with a doozy of a backstory something about children and the horrors of war. His sentimentalizing makes the paintings even more popular and draws the notice of a newspaper society columnist Dick Nolan (Danny Huston). Even after she lets the cat out of the bag and the Keanes square off in court Adams comports herself with the innocence that helped make her a star. (When DeeAnn mentions espresso Margaret says ""Whats that? Like reefer?"") The movie doesnt ask much of Adams. She underplays everything (anger epiphany satisfaction) maybe in preparation of getting out of Waltzs way. This is one of the strangest examples of an actor and director flouting egregious miscasting by making it seem as though everythings fine. Waltz is doing Charles Boyer in Gaslight Jack Nicholson in The Shining Jim Carrey in Liar Liar -- at the same time. He blows a gasket after about half an hour and never stops hissing. When the art critic John Canaday (Terence Stamp) gives Walter a withering on-the-spot critique Mount Waltz explodes. Walters German accent is never explained (the actual Walter was from Lincoln Nebraska) and seems weaponized to enhance villainy. This is a Kevin Spacey part that Waltz plays with a pitchfork and horns. Hes working so hard at passion and comedy and deviant charm that youre embarrassed for him. As much as this movie might have seemed personal to Burton it lets the fraud upstage the artist. Margarets relationship to these surrealist images is vague. They seem to predict the suffering she experiences while married to Walter. But her explanation of what theyre all about feels dramatically and psychologically inadequate. You get why Walters made-up backstory took off Its characteristically manipulative. What emotional connection there is between Margaret and the paintings comes mostly from Adams. Theres comedy nonetheless. ""Im an artist"" Walter representing himself at the trial tells the judge who replies ""Maybe."" The courtroom scenes dont quite top the aggrandized shenanigans in Alexander and Karaszewskis script for The People vs. Larry Flynt. But they get the lunacy of the event. At this point in the film though Burtons lost a feel for the tone. For most of Big Eyes hes as much a fish out of water as Margaret -- or a fish who doesnt like that hes gone from the ocean to a cup. His rhythms with characters who operate at a human scale are off. Naturalism doesnt come naturally to him so a car cant even pull up to a curb without music being dumped all over the shot. The air of Hitchcock that drifts through these scenes is welcome the Bay Area setting the idea of delusion and deception Adamss resemblance to his heroines the use of Krysten Ritter as a Thelma Ritter-type skeptic. But Burton might need to get further from blockbuster bloat in order to regain his formal mastery of kitsch. Right now his sense of comic portraiture is too easily mistakable for splatter painting.  Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures Speaking of splatter the best thing (one of them anyway) about the movie adaptation of Stephen Sondheims fairy-tale musical Into the Woods is the appalled terrified face James Cordens Baker makes whenever Meryl Streeps witch crashes one of his scenes. Its the look you give someone caught in the act of robbing you. Its the look you give before an armored truck runs you off the road. Streep blasts into this movie like a hurricane-force wind spits out her lines (even the ones shes singing) like theres a hair in her mouth then explodes into leaves or dust. Its a wonder that Cordens exasperated baker doesnt also crack up. Johnny Depp has two scenes as Little Red Riding Hoods wolf but Streep is the one huffing puffing and blowing down the house. Eventually shes given blue costumes blue makeup and blue hair. Shes like an enormous Boo Berry. The night I saw it the audience burst into applause every time Streep finished a number. The movie which Rob Marshall directed doesnt care that much about James Lapine and Sondheims show which arrived on Broadway in November 1987. Its being sold by Disney as a fun tongue-in-cheek fairy tale. The theater show is full of sexual anxiety guilt and loss. But Marshall who did Chicago and Nine the way a blender does ice is working for the sophisticated kiddies who might be in the audience. He lets the Freudian ideas come to the surface. And the tale itself marches along a pretense of fun. This is a more tolerably executed operation than Marshalls other two musicals. The staging is mostly logical and hes kept things extremely watchable even at the expense of the show itself. The story of this baker and his wife (Emily Blunt) trying to reverse an infertility curse (cast by the witch and its a long story) weaves in and out of the tales of Cinderella (Anna Kendrick) Jack (Daniel Huttlestone) and the beanstalk and his mother (Tracey Ullman) Little Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford) and the drama of the witch who happens to have locked away Rapunzel (Mackenzie Mauzy). Most of these people wind up in the forest together with the baker his wife and the witch warping the trajectory of the tales to get what they want. Sondheim and Lapines exploration of cynicism lust and human nature is mostly still intact often courtesy of the emotional thoughtfulness that comes through from Kendrick and especially Blunt. The emphasis is placed on the comedy which still works. There are Streeps spasms and Cordons mugging but also Christine Baranski Lucy Punch and Tammy Blanchard forming what amounts to Godzillas three-headed Ghidorah which feasts on its step-relative and house-wench Cinderella. Chris Pine plays her prince finding another hilarious variation on William Shatner. He and Rapunzels prince (Billy Magnussen) square off in song (""Agony"") while standing on rocks at the edge of a waterfall throwing opening their legs and thrusting their crotches at the valley below. But their parody of creamy dreamy hotness is missing the disillusionment of the reality of husbandhood thats been removed from the film. Most of the original shows senses of moral (or cosmic) consequence and emotional deflation are gone. The movie is a watchable tuneful contraption. There are songs within songs within songs persuasively sung and clever roundelays among the characters. Its as dreary looking as quasi-realist movie musicals tend to be since Bob Fosse but Marshall doesnt try to ape Fosse the way he did with his previous two musicals. You just get a sense of compromise here that something is missing. The film adaptation which is credited to Lapine has clearly neutered its source. The deep cut of immorality and regret doesnt penetrate as far. Its more like a fantastical flesh wound. The body count is smaller the air of angst thinner. Its a fine musical. But at best its diet Sondheim. He just isnt worth doing if youre going into the woods only to wind up in the weeds.

In the enduring rivalry between words and music words have had a powerful ally in Broadway lyricist Stephen Sondheim. Tutored by Oscar Hammerstein the young Sondheim wrote the lyrics for the musicals ""West Side Story"" and ""Gypsy"" before he added ""composer"" to his resume with ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.""For ""Into the Woods"" he enlisted two co-authors the Brothers Grimm. But the sharp ironic mind behind this musical mash-up is still Sondheim. The film version directed by Rob Marshall (""Chicago"") is a beautiful holiday sugar plum with a tart center.After the obligatory words ""Once upon a time"" a roundelay introduces us to Cinderella (Anna Kendrick) Little Red Riding Hood (pint-size scene-stealer Lilla Crawford) Rapunzel (Mackenzie Mauzy) a baker and his wife (James Corden and Emily Blunt) and Jack (of beanstalk fame played by talented tyke Daniel Huttlestone of ""Les Miserables""). Each of them has a wish in which a witch (Meryl Streep) will play a part. The baker wants to have a child but the witch cursed the bakers marriage because his father once stole beans from her garden. But she agrees to lift the curse if the baker can obtain a white cow a red robe a lock of golden hair and a glass slipper.The shell game in which the various characters trade something seemingly worthless for a treasure unfolds like an extended Marx Brothers routine. By the time the fairy dust settles Red has outwitted the hungry wolf (Johnny Depp) Jack has recovered his beloved cow the bakers have a baby Rapunzel is freed from the tower Cinderella is marrying the Prince (Chris Pine) and even the blue-haired witch is lovely again.But about that beanstalk. ... Those whove seen the stage version of the musical know that there is a false ending and a serious reversal of tone as a rumbling giant climbs down from the clouds to get even with the thieving Jack. The beautiful cinematography from the beginning of the film which resembles a hand-tinted photograph is replaced by a perpetual foggy nighttime like an inverted version of ""A Midsummers Night Dream.""The ominous tone slows the pace occasionally to a crawl but theres no stopping Streep. Her song about wanting to be a good mother (to Rapunzel) is an Ethel Merman-sized lollapalooza. Indeed most of the famous faces are surprisingly adept at singing. Even when the actors are not lip-syncing (which seems to be about half the time) the dense clever lyrics are intelligible.""Into the Woods"" could have taken a well-worn path toward stagey sentiments but those who worried that Hollywood might drain the enchantment from the Enchanted Forest can live happily after.{amp;rule}What ""Into the Woods""  Three stars out of four  Rating PG  Run time 204  Content Mature thematic elements fantasy action and peril Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

By Preston Jonesdfw.comPosted 635pm on Thursday Jan. 15 2015 Thursday Jan. 15 2015 Wednesday Dec. 17 2014 By Preston Jones Fort Worth Star-Telegram The journey from stage to screen has been a remarkably long one for Stephen Sondheim and James Lapines Into the Woods.The comedic musical drama first began its transition from Broadway (where it opened in 1987) to the big screen over 20 years ago languishing in development before finally being taken up appropriately enough by director Rob Marshall whose 2002 Oscar-winning adaptation of Chicago kick-started Hollywoods ongoing renewed affection for musicals. That lengthy gestation period allows Into the Woods a meta-mashup of Grimm Brothers fairy tales from a decidedly ironic yet sentimental viewpoint to arrive in theaters amid a flurry of fantastical franchises dominating the box office. (If only this adaptation had materialized when the moviegoing public was in the full throes of Harry Potter-dom.) The sly send-up of fantasy tropes and healthy doses of humor help Into the Woods feel very much like the books and films it gently satirizes even as it stands on its own as a solid entry into the musical-fantasy genre.Indeed the story setting Woods plot in motion is the stuff of a thousand fables A childless baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt) discover a curse upon their house cast by a vindictive witch (Meryl Streep) who reveals that the curse can be reversed with the acquisition of four special specific items.Tasked with tracking said items down in three days time the baker and his wife set off for the forest where they cross paths with a slew of fairy-tale familiars Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford); Cinderella (Anna Kendrick) and Jack of ""and the Beanstalk"" fame (Daniel Huttlestone) among others.The plot twists and turns upending expectations and showcasing Sondheims trademark time signature shifts which the glittering cast mostly handles with aplomb. Corden Blunt Kendrick and Streep (her rendition of Stay With Me is a heartbreaking showstopper) handle the bulk of the singing and each rises to the considerable challenge of the knotty lyrics. Even the films Prince Charming Chris Pine -- thats Captain Kirk to you Star Trek reboot fans -- proves a deft comedic singer during his highlight Agony. The less said about Johnny Depps mercifully brief crooning as the Wolf the better.Lapine adapted his musical book for the film and Marshalls restless staging -- there are long stretches where the shadows swallow all the action -- can occasionally make Woods feel more grim and manic than it really is.Despite marketing suggesting otherwise parents toting children to the film might be caught somewhat off-guard by Into the Woods occasionally bleak tone particularly in the films second half. There are ribald allusions sprinkled throughout but the giant attack-fueled portion of the story goes to some dark places. (Purists might complain about the abrupt transition between the musicals first and second acts just as anyone coming to the story fresh might be confused by the sudden transition from breezy comedy to sobering drama.)Still the intrusion of ""real life"" into fantasy feels particularly timely in an age of paranoia unrest and terror abroad; acknowledging that reality always awaits after every storys end gives the finale a surprising emotional wallop.Marshalls cinematic adaptation aims to find the feeling behind the fables and largely succeeds making these Woods rather lovely dark and deep.

Sondheim is Broadway; Disney is Main Street. Sondheim is about moral ambiguities; Disney is about moral lessons. Sondheim is about challenging adult assumptions; Disney is about making sure every four-year-old girl in America buys a tiara. There really is no place where the two could meet. Except in a fairy tale. Which is where the two come together in Disneys new ""Into the Woods"" which brings a showbizzy director and a starry cast to a slightly altered -- though not luckily neutered -- version of the Broadway hit. Yes songs and characters have necessarily been cut. But this adaptation (done by James Lapine who wrote the book for the original show) does a good job of keeping not only the interwoven stories (primarily ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" and ""Cinderella"") but Sondheims larger (and especially for Disney) quite bolder themes about desire innocence and what happens after the ever-after. The cast is generally first-rate too from Meryl Streep (having a great time as the Witch) and Anna Kendrick (singing prettily as Cinderella) to a rambunctious James Corden as the Baker and Emily Blunt in a genuinely touching performance as the unsatisfied Bakers Wife. And as the Wolf Johnny Depp is thankfully here just long enough to threaten to devour Little Red Riding Hood not so long that he starts in on the scenery too. Rob Marshall -- who previously shepherded a glossy if slightly diluted version of ""Chicago"" to the screen -- does a decent job transferring the material. The opening number is both complicated and seamless; the locations are simultaneously real and transporting. Yet Marshall shows less subtlety directing some of the actors. Chris Pine for example has clearly been told to camp it up as Prince Charming; as Little Red Riding Hood young Lilla Crawford hits all her lines with tediously bratty emphasis. Really if youre not going to trust this material -- if Sondheims sophistication makes you nervous -- why do it at all? And yet there are some wonderfully human moments particularly as Streeps Witch mourns an estrangement from her daughter or Blunts Wife wrestles with temptation. And despite the trims and tweaks and cuts you can still see Sondheims concerns. The first of course is the fiction of ""happily ever after."" Sondheim not only brings back the original ugly details of these stories he brings his own contemporary pessimism to bear; even when people here get what they wished for its not what they expected. And the second is the idea of the forest itself. ""Into the Woods"" is the title but its also a sly pun -- where these characters are venturing isnt just a forest but a place thick with ""woulds"" with obligations possibilities conditions consequences. With sex too. Not the sort that any child would notice (or that betrays the Disney brand or that PG rating). But look again at the Witch embittered because she is no longer attractive or the Bakers Wife desperate for a child; consider Prince Charming compulsively wooing every woman he meets or the Wolf as lascivious as a Tex Avery predator. Every character here has their own secret hunger -- and it twists their lives until (and this is the only ""happy"" ending the story provides) they finally realize what it is. And that perhaps is the biggest difference between a Disney fairy tale and a Sondheim one. Theirs is about the gaining of knowledge. His is about the getting of wisdom. Into the Woods (PG) Disney (124 min.) Directed by Rob Marshall. With Meryl Streep Anna Kendrick Johnny Depp. Now playing in New Jersey.

Its been 27 years since the Stephen Sondheim musical opened on Broadway. In that time innumerable directors stars and approaches have been proposed only to fade away.Odds seemed high that Disney known for its ""happily ever after"" canon would insert rosy twists into a plot where some wishes lead to disaster people make mistakes and ""Sometimes people leave you/Halfway through the wood"" as one song goes.Happily Rob Marshall ended up at the helm. Marshall earned an Oscar nomination for best director for Chicago the 2003 winner for best picture. Here every note shows hes attuned to the psychological complexities in this tapestry of tales. As with Chicago Marshall makes bold choices but they pay off. His cast may glitter with film stars but they work as an ensemble and keep their stories emotionally true against a terrifically rich orchestral accompaniment.James Cordens earnest performance sets the tone as the childless baker who gets a visit from a witch (Meryl Streep) in a deliciously detailed cottage set amid the green fields of the countryside. The witch tells the baker and his wife (Emily Blunt) theyre childless because of a spell shes cast. They can reverse the curse if they go to the woods to bring her a cow as white as milk a cape as red as blood a slipper as pure as gold and hair as yellow as corn.Their search leads to a collision with Jack (Daniel Huttlestone) on his way to sell his cow Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford) skipping to grandmothers house Cinderella (Anna Kendrick) fleeing Prince Charmings ball in a golden slipper and Rapunzel (Mackenzie Mauzy) letting down her hair.The much-honored Streep gave a crowd-pleasing singing turn in the Mamma Mia musical but nothing prepares you for the power and passion of her witch.Theres one change that yields a happier ending for a couple of characters but the big story stays true as it portrays the woods as our journey through the mysterious places of our lives where we wish dream risk lose and win.Unlike the recent film adaptation of Annie Into the Woods is a winner.INTO THE WOODS (A-)Directed by Rob Marshall.

"Review The trip Into the Woods is spooky serious delightful - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review The trip Into the Woods is spooky thoughtful delightful Into the Woods Peter Mountain / Disney An encounter in the woods The Baker (James Corden) and his Wife (Emily Blunt) meet Jack (Daniel Huttlestone) and his beloved cow Milky White. An encounter in the woods The Baker (James Corden) and his Wife (Emily Blunt) meet Jack (Daniel Huttlestone) and his beloved cow Milky White. (Peter Mountain / Disney) Betsy Sharkey Adventures dangers and delights as a new movie musical ventures Into the Woods ""Into the Woods"" the deliciously arch deceptively deep fractured fairy tale with its soaring Sondheim showstoppers has made it to the big screen virtually untouched by Hollywoods big tall terrible giants whose meddling can so often make a mess of things.As youd expect the woods have been partially repopulated by movie stars -- Meryl Streep Emily Blunt Anna Kendrick Chris Pine and Johnny Depp among them -- who thankfully can actually sing. Director Rob Marshall who did a pretty swell job of bringing the ""Pop Six Squish Uh Uh"" of ""Chicago"" to film wraps all of his love for Broadway musicals around his cast pulling out performances that have already drawn awards nominations for Streep and Blunt.The other major roles are filled by actors who have spent their share of time doing musical theater in addition to their film and TV work. Among them are Tony winners Christine Baranski and James Corden Tony-nominated Billy Magnussen and the young stage veterans Lilla Crawford who starred as ""Annie"" on Broadway and Daniel Huttlestone whose credits include ""Oliver"" and ""Les Miserables"" both in London. I suspect James Lapine eased the transition from stage to screen. He won a Tony for the droll wit of the musicals book in the first place and took on screenplay duties for the film ensuring that the way his words intertwined so tightly with Stephen Sondheims Tony-winning music and lyrics on stage would remain intact. ""Into the Woods"" Disneys live-action adaptation of the fairytale musical mash-up held its world premiere at New Yorks Ziegfeld Theater on Dec. 8 2014. (Nardine Saad) While Marshall has taken care to not break the musicals magical spell he hasnt materially changed it either. So if you are expecting an experience that feels as if it could happen only in the movies the directors way through the ""Woods"" wont take you there.The special effects are like showy accessories fun but not fundamental though the witchs comings and goings are a smoky spooky blast. The overall look of the film is lush and storybook-like with a lovely painterly touch and soft rich hues heavy on the blues that matches its sometimes-introspective mood.Shooting on location does give the story visual depth. The trees leaves and streams are beautifully real as is the quaint village at the edge of the woods. Englands countryside villages and castles provide much of the raw material all well used by director of photography Dion Beebe and production designer Dennis Gassner. John DeLuca proves facile in staging the musical numbers around all those rocks and trees; David Krane is respectful in adapting the score. Peter Swords Kings work on makeup and tresses is top notch with a special shout out to J. Roy Helland who handled the witchs. But what makes ""Into the Woods"" so entertaining is the cleverness of the tale itself and the way specific characters match the talents of its storytellers. A strong ensemble was assembled by those involved in casting -- Francine Maisler Bernard Telsey and Tiffany Little Canfield.The foundation of the story begs borrows and steals liberally from many favorite fairy tales Cinderella (Kendrick) with her lost slipper Prince Charming (Pine) searching to find her the wicked stepmother (Baranski) and her daughters (Lucy Punch and Tammy Blanchard) in the way. Kendrick Pine and Baranski all pitch-perfect including their comic timing.Then theres Red Riding Hood (Crawford) and her fated trip into the woods to visit an ailing Granny (Annette Crosbie) with the hungry Wolf (Depp) lurking. Rapunzel (MacKenzie Mauzy) locked in her tower throws down that long golden braid to her prince (Magnussen) and others who do not wish her as well. Young Jack (Huttlestone) still trades in his cow for magic beans enraging his mother (Tracey Ullman) and enraging a giant (Frances De La Tour) more.All important to stitch the tales together is the Baker (Corden) and his barren wife (Blunt) whose efforts to break the witchs curse so they may have a child require a great many trips into the woods to find as the witch requires ""a cow as white as milk [Jacks] a cape as red as blood [Reds] hair as yellow as corn [Rapunzels] and a slipper as pure as gold [Cinderellas].""Not surprisingly the witch is key. In Streeps good hands she crackles with rage resentment and revenge but she also has a wicked sense of humor and never ever forgets this is a fable.Though all the performances are like the prince charming Blunt as the Bakers wife is particularly good as a young wife trying to sort out her role in this life. The actress effortlessly moves through so many moods its as if her charisma is carried on the wind.The films youngsters are both great. Crawford makes a mischievous Red Riding Hoods munching and musing such fun. Huttlestone as the not-too-bright Jack delivers ""Giants in the Sky"" so well that of all the songs in the film its the one that keeps playing in my head.In starting with fairy tales Lapine and Sondheim were already dealing with layered stories. But in using the woods as the central intersection there are any number of other ideas in play other morals. Some serious like those about parenthood -- will the Baker be a fit father? Or whether the prince Cinderella wished for is really who she wants.If anything some of the darker themes are heightened. Cutting toes to make a slipper fit the blood dripping; blinding both the bad and the good in revenge a banishment a death -- may be too much for some little ones.But mostly it is delightful to stroll ""Into the Woods"" and get lost in this musical magical world.

"Into the Woods starring Meryl Streep and Emily Blunt reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Into the Woods Is Lost in the Second Act Into the Woods Is Lost in the Second Act Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 24 2014 1037 AM Into the Woods Great cast. Great score. So why is Rob Marshalls adaptation so lost in the woods? By Dana Stevens James Corden Emily Blunt and Daniel Huttlestone in Into the Woods. Photo by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures Rob Marshalls lushly mounted but inert Into the Woods opens like Stephen Sondheim and James Lapines 1987 stage musical in grand and promising fashion with the words ""Once upon a time."" The complex title number weaves characters from several different fairytales--Cinderella Red Riding Hood and Jack (of beanstalk-climbing fame)--into a new story about a baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt) longing in vain for a child. The tone set by this song establishes that this version of these classic stories will be an irreverent unsentimental and sometimes dark-tinged one ""Into the woods to bring the bread to Granny who is sick in bed"" sings Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford) jauntily as she skips toward the forest. ""Never can tell what lies ahead--for all that I know shes already dead."" But nothing about this opening number--or indeed the whole first half of the movie--prepares the viewer for the steep dive into irredeemable bleakness the second half will take. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. That rapid descent from hope to (near) despair is of course built into the Sondheim/Lapine show. Into the Woods is an adult inquiry into the promises of childhood fairytales; in essence its a musical that asks ""What happens after happily ever after?"" At the time of the shows original Broadway run in the late 80s the pitch-dark second act--in which lets just say bad things happen to good people--read to many audience members as a metaphor for the AIDS crisis. (""The trouble with fables is everyone looks for symbolism"" Sondheim has responded.) But the stage version of Into the Woods--a two-act play in which the second act examines the unsettling moral implications of the first--has a dramatic shape and a moral wisdom that this rushed and thematically murky adaptation lacks. Thats in part because of significant cuts and condensations that the filmmakers have chosen to make (the screenplay is adapted by Lapine from his own book). Emily Blunt almost out-charms Anna Kendrick which takes some doing. For starters two key characters--including the fourth-wall-breaking narrator--have essentially been eliminated as have the last song of the first act (""Ever After"") and the first song of the second (""So Happy"")--essentially the two numbers that bookend the premature happy ending and its rapid dissolution. Without any formal transition between the first and second halves of the story (and without the dramatic structure furnished by these and other missing songs) the plays 180-degree reversal of tone midway through goes from subversive to simply confusing. Advertisement That first half though has some treats to offer. After Red Riding Hood has embarked on her journey to Grandmas the infertile bakers are visited by a witch (an enjoyably scenery-gnawing Meryl Streep) who promises to lift the curse she placed on them years ago if they can bring her a few precious items. This magical scavenger hunt becomes the device that brings the disparate plotlines together as the baker and his wife head into the forest to score Jacks cow Red Riding Hoods cape Cinderellas shoe and eventually a ropey braid of hair snatched from Rapunzel (Mackenzie Mauzy) whos been imprisoned in a tower by the witch. Meanwhile Cinderella (Anna Kendrick) outsmarts her smarmy stepmother (Christine Baranski) and makes it to the royal festival--but she too flees into the woods where shell cross paths with the rest of the characters in a roundelay of seductions negotiations and betrayals. Heres where I should confess Im not the Stephen Sondheim-head some musical theater fans are. Though I always admire this composers twisted way with a lyric (and consider ""Send in the Clowns"" to be an essential of the American songbook as beautiful interpreted by Bernadette Peters as it is by Krusty the Clown) I generally prefer my musicals with less recitative-style sung dialogue and more catchy beltable melodies. This version of Into the Woods features a few showstoppers even if for me they usually hit more because of the performance than the song. Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen as two frustrated princes rip their shirtfronts open in a frenzy of competitive suffering in the amusingly hammy duet ""Agony."" (Not to beat a dead horse about ill-conceived cuts from the stage show but that song sadly loses the second-act reprise thats one of the highlights the stage version.) And as the indecisive Cinderella Anna Kendrick gets to showcase her clarion soprano and trademark self-deprecation in a solo sung while stuck in tar on the steps of the palace. Meryl Streep doesnt quite have the vocal control of Kendrick or Emily Blunt both of whom make impeccable musical-theater heroines. (Blunt almost out-charms Kendrick which takes some doing.) But Streep has always been able to put over a song like nobodys business as she proves in a melodramatic but wrenching mid-movie ballad ""Stay With Me"" about the pain of a parent letting go of a child--a song that sets up the themes of loss grief and resilience that come to dominate the second act. In fact the whole cast (with the possible exception of Johnny Depp whos a little too in love with himself in a shticky one-song cameo as the Big Bad Wolf) does a solid-to-excellent job. But theres a vast gulf between the plotlines that are fun to follow (for me Blunts Kendricks and Streeps) and the ones that arent so that the films energy keeps rising and falling from scene to scene. The tedium of Into the Woods second half has less to do with the downbeat subject matter than Marshalls clumsy direction. When the tone shifts from buoyant to grim Marshall (who directed the Oscar-winning but to me airless 2002 screen adaptation of Chicago) seems to lose control of the pacing and tone packing in multiple CGI-heavy climaxes that feel too familiar from the recent run of fairytale-inspired blockbusters (Snow White and the Huntsman Maleficent and more). Grit-enriched fairytales are having a major cultural moment (in part perhaps because of the precedent set by Into the Woods success) which may help account for why this material feels less fresh than it might have in 1987. But the bigger problem is that after the (insufficiently demarcated) break Marshall seems to lose the thread of what Into the Woods is meant to be about. Instead of being a rueful meditation on the inevitable disappointments of adulthood the last act plays out as a generic dystopian bummer. Theres a ""junior version"" of Into the Woods designed for performance in schools and by childrens theater companies that leaves off the entire second act (as well as trimming some of the harsher material from the first). We should be grateful I guess that in adapting the material Disney at least tried to reproduce the decidedly adult developments of the plays second act rather than simply lopping off the scary stuff and offering up the first half as heartwarming family fare. (Especially given the studios proprietary interest in many of the characters in question.) Still Id head to Grandmothers house over the holidays with a different suggestion in your basket--maybe if Grannys game the original Broadway production starring a sublime Bernadette Peters and currently streaming on Amazon.

"Into the Woods strains to stay on the path review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesInto the Woods strains to stay on the path review Meryl Streep Anna Kendrick and Emily Blunt lead a starry cast in the movie adaptation of well-loved 1987 Broadway musical Into the Woods.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterWed. Dec. 24 2014Into the WoodsStarring Anna Kendrick Daniel Huttlestone James Corden Emily Blunt Tracey Ullman Lilla Crawford Meryl Streep Johnny Depp Billy Magnussen Mackenzie Mauzy and Chris Pine. Directed by Rob Marshall. 125 minutes. Opens Dec. 25 at major theatres. PGNever having seen the well-loved 1987 Broadway musical from composer Stephen Sondheim and writer James Lapine -- like Gone Girl fans of the source material fret about its trip from stage to screen -- my first exposure is the onscreen variety.So I cant say if the film is a faithful adaptation. But from a multiplex seat rather than an orchestra row its a mixed bag of clever twists on familiar storybook myths engaging performances and forgettable songs.Article Continued BelowUpdated Brothers Grimm fairy tales Cinderella Little Red Riding Hood Jack and the Beanstalk and Rapunzel spin an allegory about the disappointments that lurk between wishes and reality and a dark forest where straying from the path has consequences.Meryl Streep plays the Witch in Into the Woods the movie adaptation of the stage musical.Its all whipped up into a busy and occasionally confusing story that plays out in often tartly amusing ways with some sinister elements. It verges on the creepy in the case of Johnny Depps leering wolf eyeing Little Red Riding Hood with a sly ""whats in your basket?"" Packed with fairy tale characters and a busy interwoven story set up with a musical prologue theres plenty of fantasy but little chance of leaving the theatre humming any of the songs from the operetta-style score.The cast is a dynamic lineup of Hollywood names some with surprisingly good singing voices. Emily Blunt is spot on as the resourceful and determined Bakers Wife. Meryl Streep is over-the-top delightful as the Witch who turns the plot with her demands that set off a frenzied scavenger hunt in the woods to reverse a curse and grant a wish.In fact theres a lot of wishing going on. The Baker (engaging Brit James Corden soon to take over from Craig Ferguson as the host of the The Late Late Show) and his Wife are desperate for a child.Cinderella (Anna Kendrick) wants to go to the Kings festival at the castle. Jack (Daniel Huttlestone) wishes he didnt have to sell his beloved cow Milky-White. But his mother (Tracey Ullman terrific here) says the unproductive cows got to go.As for bright-yet-bratty Little Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford) shes wishing she had the smarts to stay on the proper path to get to Grandmas.A curse has put the Baker and his Wife in their parental pickle but the Witch has a plan that can benefit everybody. Shell lift the curse she placed on the Baker after his father stole magic beans (and she nabbed their baby Rapunzel now grown up as MacKenzie Mauzy) if theyll bring her four rare items. And wouldnt you know it all of them are somewhere in the woods.In making his third movie musical director Rob Marshall isnt as brash as in his previous musical the Oscar-winning Chicago and thankfully far removed from overstuffed Nine.Marshall scores a comic hit with the duet ""Agony"" which sees Chris Pines Prince Charming and his brother Rapunzels Prince (Billy Magnussen) face off over whose torment over their inaccessible sweeties is worse.Once-upon-a-time characters go bumbling and stumbling in the woods as the Baker and his Wife split up to knock items off the Witchs list. Its occasionally hard to follow but the frantic pace keeps the action moving along with frequent pauses for somebody to start singing. And they do sing a lot. But once the goodies are gathered Into the Woods loses its momentum and interest starts to wane.

December 24 2014 -- 1216pm Video (0235)  This modern twist on the beloved Brothers Grimm fairy tales intertwines the plots of a few choice stories and explores the consequences of the characters wishes and quests. The humorous and heartfelt musical follows the classic tales of Cinderella Little Red Riding Hood Jack and the Beanstalk and Rapunzel - all tied together by an original story involving a baker and his wife their wish to begin a family and their interaction with the witch who has put a curse on them. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert Once upon a time there was a magic land. Little Red Riding Hood lived there with Cinderella Rapunzel and Jack from the beanstalk. They tried to find unconditional love for their families but found it can be a horrible battle. Especially while confronting the Wicked Witch who used to be the Devil Who Wears Prada. Or being wooed by the Big Bad Wolf who used to be Sweeney Todd and liked to eat women. Or Prince Charming who was admittedly ""charming not sincere."" They did not all live happily ever after but wow the audience did. ""Into the Woods"" is a paean to the primal magic of storytelling. Brothers Grimm fairy tales were designed to be astonishing but theres a deeper twisted anarchy in Stephen Sondheims and James Lapines Broadway blockbuster. Based on the bloodcurdling 19th-century German fables adding characters from 17th-century Frances Charles Perrault and several new creations of their own their musical resembles a macabre childrens book illustrated by Charles Addams. It begins seemingly prettified simplified. Then it takes a sharp Act II turn from mollycoddling entertainment into mockery and melodrama. Original Version Naughty Bits Spoiler Alert Significant characters get slain or sleep together lustfully or kill and hook up concurrently. The new Disney translation tones things down ... a bit. It gives us a world of disregarded peasants neglected children and rotten rulers -- a world not so very far from todays. The story follows the escapades of a dozen storybook folk represented by a touching top-tier Anglo-American cast either stars or people who soon will be. We quickly meet lovelorn Cinderella (Anna Kendrick) nearly pubescent Little Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford) farm boy dolt Jack (Daniel Huttlestone) the kind obtuse village baker (James Corden) and his cookie-sweet childless wife (Emily Blunt in prime form like all the rest). They face off against a spell-casting hag (Meryl Streep) the Big Bad Wolf (Johnny Depp with appetite in his eyes a take that is shiftier sexier and gorier than you bargained for) and the Prince (Chris Pine poised to shatter the world record for one-night stands). Director Rob Marshall an Oscar nominee for his adaptation of ""Chicago"" made some controversy-shy compromises here. The goth overtones are lighter than in the original Broadway staging (still available on home video) but the general weirdness has not been trimmed to unrecognizable dimensions. Marshall reworks it into an unforgettable fantasy of its own a tolerably disquieting yet invitingly grim joy. The heroes have more to contend with than the occasional angry giant. Isnt Cinderellas nasty stepmother even creepier cutting off one daughters toe and the others heel to fit that slipper Cinder left at the Palace? (Christine Baranski is in fine form by the way.) Feed Loader Kendricks misadventure with Pine is a grimly funny injunction not to yearn for a prince who may be rolling in money but who cheats for fun. ""Agony"" his song about hammy heartbreak is fabulous romantic parody. Blunt is enchantingly touching and rich-voiced as the would-be mother wistfully desiring a little child as much as the Wolf does and a prince as much as Cinderella does. Her duets with Corden hit every note with remarkable musical and artistic sophistication. Streep also leads the fable to the sound-filled heavens but if youve heard her sing in earlier movies you knew that already. The point of it all is that disappointments cant be avoided especially when childhood myths are turned on their heads. This is a musical full of discordant notes and compromises and problems; parents now and then bad to their offspring kids at times imbecilic. Its deliberately fearsome because being properly disturbed is a rite of passage for the questioning rebellious child in all of us. A pleasurable revealing informative one. 612-673-7186 Colin Covert has covered films for the Star Tribune for 20 years interviewing Peter Jackson Kate Winslet Steven Spielberg Cate Blanchett Quentin Tarantino Neil Gaiman and John Travolta to name a few.

By Peter Rainer Film critic December 24 2014 Save for later Saved Into the Woods stars Meryl Streep. Peter Mountain/Disney Enterprises Inc./AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide The Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine 1987 musical ""Into the Woods"" has been transferred to the screen by director Rob Marshall with most of its complexities and light-dark tonalities intact. Rumor had it this Disney production would bland out the shows richness but this turns out not to be the case. Although its first hour is more stunning than its second this is a movie musical that for a change never degenerates into a false wholesomeness. Its one of the rare musicals that both children and adults can enjoy though for somewhat different reasons. Children will delight in the vast potpourri of classic fairy tales that have been mashed together; adults will appreciate the wisdom and moral reckonings in the retellings.The cast is large and for the most part up to the task. James Corden and Emily Blunt are wonderful as the village baker and his wife who are childless due to the curse placed upon them (long story) by the blue-haired Wicked Witch played and sung with ravishing zest by Meryl Streep looking like shes having the time of her life. Anna Kendrick (a bit vanilla for my taste) is Cinderella who in this version of the tale purposely leaves behind her glass slipper for the Prince (Chris Pine) to find. The Prince is a fatuous twit whose best line comes when he confesses ""I was raised to be charming not sincere.""Among the large cast is also Johnny Depps somewhat underused zoot-suited Wolf Tracey Ullman as the overbearing mother of Jack (Daniel Huttlestone) and Lilla Crawford as a precocious Red Riding Hood. Most of Sondheims score one of his best is retained with full justice done to such classics as ""Children Will Listen"" and ""Stay With Me.""

In the year-end glut of holiday films a lot of new ones will be around to keep you entertained but The New York Observer wont. Im off to wrap some gifts ring some bells and get some sleep. Well return with our first issue of a brand new year on January 7. Meanwhile heres a rundown of whats coming in the weeks ahead. UNBROKEN Put this one at the top of your must-see list. Angelina Jolie might not in my opinion have yet reached the heights of the acting profession but with this passionate inspired technically awesome and profoundly exciting chronicle of the life of Louie Zamperini the American Olympic athlete who survived 47 days in a lifeboat and two years as a Japanese prisoner of war during World War II she rises to the top rank of first-class film directors in a male-dominated field overcrowded with hacks. Beginning with a troubled childhood as the son of Italian immigrants in California Louie was an outsider who seemed destined for a life of crime but it was the guidance of an older brother that gave him a talisman to live by ""If I can take it I can make it."" Played with enormous charisma and extraordinary physical endurance by rising U.K. newcomer and inevitable future star Jack OConnell Louie moves from the 1936 Olympic games in Berlin to the rank of pilot shot down with two comrades and left wounded and bleeding in the shark-infested waters of the Pacific. Then the capture by the Japanese Navy--plunged into an underground hole where he listened to his best friend being tortured and finally found himself the personal victim of a sadistic commandant (played unflinchingly by the Japanese singer-composer Miyavi) who subjected him to years of unflagging brutality. Angelina Jolies Unbroken tells the story of P.O.W. Louie Zamperini. Its hard to believe anyone could survive inhumanities this severe and still live but Louie earned a Purple Heart realized his dream of attending one last Olympics (in Japan of all places) and went on to tell his story in the critically acclaimed biography Unbroken by Laura Hillenbrand which spent 180 weeks on the best-seller list before becoming the source material for this remarkable screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen Richard LaGravenese and William Nicholson. Ms. Jolies obsession with Louie who died in July at age 97 informs every scene. The air strikes and raft and camp sequences hold equal weight the camerawork by Roger Deakins is magnificent and the vast supporting cast of unknowns including Domhnall Gleeson Garrett Hedlund Finn Wittrock and Luke Treadaway is exemplary. Although it eschews the usual P.O.W. camp cliches Unbroken is probably too grim brutal and depressing for most viewers and the decision to open it on Christmas Day is questionable. But as a tribute to one heros fortitude in refusing to give in to evil it gives off its own admirable feeling of positive spiritual energy that left me feeling good about the best qualities of mankind. One of the finest achievements of the 2014 film year. AMERICAN SNIPER Another war biopic opening on Christmas day with tight two-fisted direction by Clint Eastwood and a compelling centerpiece performance by Bradley Cooper as a Texas rodeo cowboy full of anger and rage who channels his natural-born killer instincts into a life of positive aggression fighting terrorists as Chris Kyle Americas most decorated Navy SEAL. On his first day of duty hes assigned to protect the Marines from enemy snipers killing a woman and a child carrying a grenade in the bargain. From there on his constant raids on Muslim homes grow more repetitive as the mans civilian problems lead to panic and impotence. After four tours of duty 1000 days on the battlefield and 163 kills Chris comes home for good but the psychological damage has been severe. Clint Eastwood directs American Sniper starring Bradley Cooper. With this film Mr. Eastwood seems to dedicate his hawks eye vision of ""supporting the troops"" to an unpopular continuation of the ongoing war in Iraq but his direction has none of the vigor of either of his previous war efforts Flags of Our Fathers and Letters From Iwo Jima. Bradley Cooper imbues Chris Kyle with the sensitivity charm and adrenalin lacking elsewhere in Jason Halls screenplay and Sienna Miller is very good as his long-suffering wife Taya. But theres no freshness in either the domestic scenes or the combat sequences that all look like outtakes from The Hurt Locker. The locales do at least look authentic though Iraq is played by Morocco. SELMA This somber by-the-numbers movie about Martin Luther King co-produced by Oprah Winfrey is not just about the man the speech or the holiday--but also the ideals and fight for dignity that led to the Nobel Prize. Race relations are still a dangerous and sensitive subject after all these years especially in light of recent headlines about racial profiling and the riots in Ferguson and other cities. But as vital as it is racial strife is a subject that cries out for a more volatile treatment than this. The Alabama marching sequences and resulting violence filmed in Selma where they actually happened are too understated for my taste. And the home life of King and his vacillating wife Coretta are muted. While he rallied for federal legislation guaranteeing every person in America the right to vote regardless of color he was opposed by the White House and denounced by J. Edgar Hoover and the F.B.I. as a political and moral degenerate. Yet he turned the other cheek until his own people challenged his sincerity. Words from the Bible still dont carry any more weight  today than they did against the whips Remingtons and helicopters that captivated and polarized a nation in the 1960s. Everyone is just too damn polite Still director Ava DuVernay has done a commendable job of enlightening American school kids about a chapter in history theyve both ignored and forgotten. And theres a powerfully nuanced and award-worthy performance by David Oyelowo as Martin Luther King. THE GAMBLER Another wet battery about a week in the life of a gambling addict with a jaundiced-looking Mark Wahlberg as a Los Angeles loser who owes 240000 to various and sundry mobsters illegal gambling rings and bail bondsmen who beat him to bloody hamburger and give him seven days to pay--or end up in the La Brea tar pits. By day hes a failed novelist-turned-associate professor of English Literature by night a hopeless loser who even wipes out his own mother (a hard venomous wasted Jessica Lange) to stake him to another roll of the roulette wheel. This is a remake of a 1974 bomb with James Caan based on a book by James Toback with overtones of Dostoevsy director Rupert Wyatt (Rise of the Planet of the Apes) is too inert and nuance-free to detect. Richard Brooks made a tougher and much better film about the tragedy of compulsive gambling in his 1985 film Fever Pitch and in 1949s The Lady Gambles even Barbara Stanwyck made a more convincing fall from respectability into casino hell than Mark Wahlberg does here. BIG EYES Tim Burtons penchant for the bizarre well serves this odd investigation of the scandal behind the marriage of artist Margaret Keane who created a kitschy world of popular but widely reviled paintings of bereft waifs with huge myopic eyes that sold like proverbial hotcakes (but were far less appetizing) and her ambitious money-hungry and manipulative husband Walter Keane who claimed to be the actual artist using his wifes success to steal the fame and fortune for himself. She was putty in his hands a pushover who went along with his schemes even allowing him to sign his own name to her work until she finally spilled the beans and sued him for slander. Amy Adams stars as Margaret Keane in Big Eyes. After years of bickering and a fair amount of illegitimate larceny the marriage came to a screeching public halt in a courtroom battle where the judge forced the estranged parties to stand before two blank canvases and prove the legitimacy of their claims. (Its the best scene in the picture.) Walter (gregarious Christoph Waltz delightfully oozing insincere charm) died in 2000 broke but still insisting he was no phony. Margaret (Amy Adams unrecognizable in a bottle-blond wig) fled to Hawaii (a perfect place for bad art) opened a new gallery and still paints every day. More subdued than usual Tim Burton presents both a creepy view of a disastrous marriage and an indictment of the tasteless commercial 1950s art scene where goofy fads seduced ignorant collectors into clamoring for ugly ornaments to match their living room walls. Nimble off the beaten track and very entertaining its the cinematic equivalent of a lava lamp. MR. TURNER This film focuses on a different kind of artist--the Victorian radical J.M.W. Turner whose vast spreads of landscapes and sailing ships vanishing into muted mists were largely dismissed in 1845 as a big waste of oil. Queen Victoria thought they were ugly. I agree with Vicky. But this prosaic and vapid bore by long-winded critically overpraised director Mike Leigh is even worse--a vacuous endurance test about an abstract loser struggling for recognition among the Impressionists of his time although we are told he is now considered an Old Master who hangs in museums (the Met owns a few) who influenced Monet and was once defended by Thackeray. He is now defended by movie critics although the reasons are specious--mainly because he is played in this droning yawn by bulbous double-chinned character actor Timothy Spall. Timothy Spall as J.M.W. Turner. The real Turner we are told was a cruel doleful and irritating heel who frittered away his time in seedy brothels insulted the cherished artists of the day and deserted his family leaving them penniless and neglected while he occasionally indulged in bad sex with his pickle-faced hunchback housekeeper. Later he took up with a widowed landlady who rented rooms in the remote port village of Margate where he went to paint whales. With this slow-moving film as evidence--the weirdly overrated equivalent to watching a mud puddle dry--there was nothing remotely interesting about anything he did in life that is worth making a two-hour-plus movie about. Mr. Spall winner of the Cannes and New York Film Critics Circle best-actor awards does his best to bring an unpleasant character to life--grunting and snorting like a boar ready to charge spitting on his canvases and dragging around with a constant wince like a fat baby with colic. With all due respect hes too repulsive to watch for 150 minutes. INTO THE WOODS The new Disney extravaganza Rob Marshall (Chicago) has made of the Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine musical is another example of concept over coherence but the entertainment value is considerable. Mr. Sondheim explores the only terrain left to us in which optimism and magic are still possible in a world gone psychotically sour--the landscape of fairy tales. And then he turns enchanted dreams into terrifying nightmares only Freud could understand. Dont take the children. Mr. Marshall uses several interlocking tales to plunge us into the woods of our imagination--three Grimm classics about Cinderella Little Red Riding Hood and Jack and the Beanstalk--plus a newly invented one about a childless baker and his wife (James Corden and Emily Blunt) who can lift an evil witchs curse if they can deliver to the old crone Cinderellas slipper Reds red cape and Jacks cow. The witch throws in Rapunzels golden hair too just to make the task more difficult. This first act long but engaging is nothing more than a merry scavenger hunt which also introduces a corny Big Bad Wolf (Johnny Depp) two handsome mixed-up princes (Chris Pine for Cinderella Billy Magnussen for Rapunzel) Cinderellas wicked stepmother (a hilarious Christine Baranski) and Meryl Streep acting all over the place as the flaky sentimental and always exhausted witch. Their stories intertwine as they trip through an enchanted forest that looks like a thicket of marzipan pretzels. Chris Pine stars as Cinderellas Prince in Into the Woods. Then in Act Two the characters get what the Sondheim-Lapine team thinks they deserve--and nobody lives happily ever after. So its back ""into the woods"" again to confront such jet-age traumas as moral disintegration deception lies betrayal disillusionment fear cowardice regrets doomed relationships failed marriages and death. The woods become such a jumble of gnarled ideas and convoluted metaphors that we quickly lose our way--and our interest. The witch loses her powers Cinderellas prince turns out to be a heel (""I was raised to be charming not sincere"") and the wife of the giant Jack returns to wreak havoc. The point of all this pseudo-intellectual gardening I suppose is to prove that fairy tales do not have happy endings and be careful what you wish for because it might make you miserable. The book is a maze in which there is no door marked ""EXIT"" the best songs like ""Children Will Listen"" and ""You Are Not Alone"" are scattered like bits of dialogue and sound derivative of songs from other Sondheim scores. Still there is much to admire here from the candyfloss costumes to the tricky special effects and the thrill of hearing everyone sing surprisingly well. (Anna Kendrick has a gorgeous soprano and Chris Pine displays wit and a musical range I never thought possible.) I left disenchanted and irritated by so many missed opportunities. Fairy tales do have happy endings despite what Mr. Sondheim might say to the contrary. And there is something wrong with any dramatized fairy tale set to music if when you go away the score is so forgettable that theres nothing to hum but the beanstalk. See you in January.

Photo Peter Mountain/Disney MOVIE REVIEW Into the Woods One of the years best. Running time 124 minutes. Rated PG (peril off-screen deaths sexual innuendo). At the Ziegfeld the Kips Bay others. Stephen Sondheims stage classic ""Into the Woods a dark and subversive musical take on fairy tales not only survives but triumphs in the composers most unlikely collaboration with Disney. Its hard edges slightly sanded by the screenwriter and Sondheims original collaborator James Lapine Rob Marshalls beautiful film is still nowhere near as family-friendly as the PG rating the Mouse House imprimatur and the Christmas Day release might suggest. Without giving too much away its only fair to warn parents of young children that a beloved character still doesnt survive though her emotionally devastating demise does take place off-screen. Adults will appreciate the best musical to come out of Hollywood so far this century -- better by far than Marshalls awkwardly staged ""Chicago which somehow won the Best Picture Oscar for 2002. Back then Marshall resorted to massive editing to camouflage most of his stars limited skills in singing and dancing. Choreography isnt an issue with this ""Into the Woods and he is working with a vocally gifted cast capable of doing full justice to Sondheims intricate music and lyrics. Emily Blunt puts in one of the years best performances as the wife to James Cordens Baker.Photo Peter Mountain/Disney Most of the characters put a twist on the Brothers Grimm but the couple at the center are creations of Sondheim and Lapines -- the Baker (James Corden upcoming host of CBSs ""Late Late Show) and the Bakers Wife (a sublime Emily Blunt). They learn theyve been cursed with childlessness by their neighbor the Witch (Meryl Streep) because she caught the Bakers father stealing magic beans years earlier. But the Witch is willing to reverse this if in three days time the couple returns with four items a cow white as milk hair as yellow as corn a cape as red as blood and a slipper pure as gold. This sends the Baker and his wife into the woods where they split up and individually encounter Cinderella (Anna Kendrick) fleeing her vain prince (Chris Pine) with one gold slipper -- and Little Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford) trying to elude the briefly seen Wolf (Johnny Depp). Also there is the none-too-bright young Jack (Daniel Huttlestone) who unwisely trades the family cow Milky White for magic beans; and locked in a doorless tower in the woods the golden-haired Rapunzel (Mackenzie Mauzy) whom the Baker doesnt realize is his sister abducted as a child by the Witch and raised as her daughter. Anna Kendrick joins a pantheon of stars in ""Into the Woods.""Photo Peter Mountain/Disney The large uniformly excellent cast also includes Tracey Ullman as Jacks Mother; Christine Baranski as Cinderellas Stepmother with Lucy Punch and Tammy Blanchard as her dimwitted prince-coveting daughters; Billy Magnussen as Rapunzels Prince; and Frances de la Tour as a lady giant who wreaks havoc in the woods after her husband has a fatal encounter with Jack and his beanstalk. As in the 1987 Broadway original ""Into the Woods pokes fun at the conventions of fairy tales and indeed the very notion of happily ever after in a story line heavily influenced by Bruno Bettelheims ""The Uses of Enchantment -- which on the screen also manages to serve as something of a post-9/11 commentary. Other changes include dropping the narrator missing cameos by some other fairy tale characters a different fate for Rapunzel -- and making Depps Wolf seem like much less of a pedophile than onstage. ""Into the Woods thankfully retains most of its wit and bite and showcases two of the years very best female performances from Streep and Blunt. Just dont expect your kids to be singing Sondheim the way they do the score from ""Frozen.

"Into The Woods (PG) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Into The Woods (PG) A movie musical journey worth taking. Meryl Streep as The Witch in the Disney musical Into The Woods Share Print Save to your profile By Christine Dolen | cdolenmiamiherald.com12/22/2014 Editor rating 3.5 The woods of Into the Woods director Rob Marshalls lush and artful rendering of Stephen Sondheim and James Lapines fairy-tale musical for grownups are not the peaceful place Robert Frost evoked in his poem Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening. Frost wrote The woods are lovely dark and deep. Sondheim Lapine and Marshall had other ideas. Their woods shot so beautifully by Oscar-winning cinematographer Dion Beebe (Memoirs of a Geisha) are certainly dark and deep sometimes lovely too. But theyre also mysterious dangerous and life-altering. The woods of Into the Woods symbolize that thing called life a journey filled with joy and sorrow triumph and disappointment fulfillment and angst. Marshall who established himself as a great movie musical director with 2002s Oscar-winning Chicago has done a masterful job of collaborating with Sondheim and Lapine to transform their 1987 Tony Award-winning two-act musical into a film that flows seamlessly as it juggles its intertwining storylines. Lapines dialogue and Sondheims lyrics utilize familiar fairy-tale figures out of the Brothers Grimm and Charles Perrault weaving them into a central narrative involving new characters a Baker (James Corden) his Wife (Emily Blunt) and a Witch (Meryl Streep). Cursed with childlessness by the Witch the couple is tasked with collecting four items that will reverse a curse placed on her one that transformed her from a beauty into a hag. In three days by the time a once-in-a-century blue moon rises the Baker and his Wife have to provide the Witch with a cow as white as milk hair as yellow as corn a cape as red as blood and a slipper as pure as gold. The Witch cant go on the quest herself as the curse cant be lifted if she touches any of the items. Each thing belongs to a different well-known character. Jack (Daniel Huttlestone) of Jack-and-the-Beanstalk fame is reluctantly taking his beloved cow Milky-White to market so he and his frustrated Mother (Tracey Ullman) wont starve. The yellow hair belongs to Rapunzel (MacKenzie Mauzy) shut up in a tower by the Witch to isolate her from the dangers of the world. The cape is worn by Little Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford) at least until shes devoured by the lascivious Wolf (Johnny Depp). And the slipper belongs to Cinderella (Anna Kendrick) an indecisive young woman who flees her handsome Prince (Chris Pine) three nights in a row. Opening with a lengthy jaunty version of the title number the movie establishes its world the way its characters will flow from song to speech and back the longing that drives everyone toward an elusive happily-ever-after. The beautiful songs from Sondheims intricate score -- including A Very Nice Prince Giants in the Sky On the Steps of the Palace Children Will Listen No One Is Alone the hilarious princely duet Agony -- are delivered by a cast of movie stars who can actually sing a few at a level that would allow them to dazzle for eight shows a week on Broadway. The standouts vocally are Kendrick who was so impressive in Pitch Perfect and sings the lead in the movie version of Jason Robert Browns musical The Last Five Years and Blunt as the conflicted Bakers Wife. Both have lovely soprano voices that they use as another expressive acting tool. Streeps voice is smaller but far better here than it was on the fluffy Mamma Mia. If any actor could interpret and convey the complexities of Sondheims music its the three-time Oscar winner who communicates the damaged woman inside the Witchs frightening exterior -- and who looks stunning in costume designer Colleen Atwoods gorgeous getup post-curse reversal. Regular-guy Corden and the comically pompous Pine (who gets to say the Princes great line ""I was raised to be charming not sincere"") sing well as do the kids in the movie Huttlestone (who played Gavroche in the Les Miserables movie) and Crawford (a recent Broadway Annie). Depps creepy lupine character is done up in a zoot suit a triumph of style over vocal substance. That Into the Woods is a Disney movie musical with a PG rating might tempt some parents to take little ones to this fine fairy-tale film. Just know that as in life bad stuff happens Cinderellas stepsisters get parts of their feet sliced off to try to fit into the golden slipper later getting blinded by birds; Little Red Riding Hood gets devoured by the Wolf and exacts a bloody revenge; the Bakers Wife has a tryst that leads to tragedy. But for anyone who can appreciate the darker side of fairy-tales told in a musical with depth and nuance Into the Woods is a journey worth taking.

Photo Credit Disney / Peter Mountain advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A musical take and an analytical twist on the classic fairy tales. Rated PG. BOTTOM LINE A capable cast and some very fine songs but parents should take note of the dark themes. This Disney movie aint kid stuff. CAST Emily Blunt James Corden Anna Kendrick Meryl Streep LENGTH 204 Those unfamiliar with the Stephen Sondheim musical ""Into the Woods"" may realize only slowly that the Walt Disney version is not actually a childrens story. The first hint comes just after Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford) escapes from The Wolf a sharp-dressed lollipop-wagging predator played by Johnny Depp. She launches into a song ""I Know Things Now."" ""He showed me things many beautiful things that I hadnt thought to explore"" she sings. ""Once his teeth were bared though I really got scared -- well excited and scared."" advertisement | advertise on newsday Say whats Red talking about here? ""Into the Woods"" inspired by Bruno Bettelheims analytical book ""The Uses of Enchantment"" plumbs the psychological depths of fairy tales and enters some dark and sophisticated territory. Though the film can be funny and whimsical and features some lovely musical numbers sung by a capable cast it falls into a demographic in-between world too troubling for young viewers yet not frank enough for adults. The cleverly intertwined narratives (by James Lapine) remain fascinating. James Corden and Emily Blunt are the Baker and his Wife who must offer various totems to a Witch (Meryl Streep) if they want to bear a child. Their desperation leads to dishonesty Its they who sell magic beans to Jack (a commanding Daniel Huttlestone) and try to wrangle a slipper off Cinderella (Anna Kendrick). Meanwhile the Witch jealously guards her greatest treasure Rapunzel (MacKenzie Mauzy). In this world as in ours every action has a consequence and every misfortune stems from a cause. Director Rob Marshall is at his best during the comedic moments as when two Princes (Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen) try to out-handsome each other while singing ""Agony."" Streep is dazzling -- evil one moment a heartbroken parent the next. The films main weakness is that its characters never become more than symbols. Theyre morally and psychologically complex but lack the little idiosyncrasies that make up a personality. Its another reason that ""Into The Woods"" may not resonate with children It speaks more to the intellect than to the heart. 241 MoviesInto the Woods trailer Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

(Peter Mountain/Disney) Meryl Streep as a witch heads a star-packed cast in Disneys Into the Woods an adaptation of a Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine musical.(Peter Mountain/Disney) A whimsical scavenger hunt Into the Woods Add to ... Brad Wheeler The Globe and Mail Published Monday Dec. 22 2014 324PM EST Last updated Monday Dec. 22 2014 342PM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Rob Marshall Written by James Lapine (based on the musical by Lapine and Stephen Sondheim) Starring Meryl Streep Emily Blunt James Corden Anna Kendrick Chris Pine Tracey Ullman Christine Baranski and Johnny Depp Classification PG Country USA Language English Hansel when he went into the woods with his sister Gretel left a trail of breadcrumbs so as to facilitate the trip back out. Hansel was the thinking childs fairy-tale protagonist.Opening on Christmas Day Disneys Into the Woods is Rob Marshalls fun and charming film adaptation of the eccentric fairy-tale musical by Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine from 1987. What is celebrated is the art of storytelling and the bedazzling attraction of a killer cast uninhibited acting giddy escapism attractive visuals and an extroverted score. Amy Adams stars in Big Eyes. Multimedia This wardrobe wizard is the real star behind Into the Woods and Big Eyes The Grand Budapest Hotel offers director Wes Andersons usual pop-up-book visuals and lt;1372014/12/18pmremote11gt;precision-timedlt;137gt; deadpan humour. Multimedia The top 10 films of 2014 as decided by Globe film critic Liam Lacey The narrative is quite the thing too A veritable parable hit parade (give us a bow Little Red Riding Hood Cinderella Rapunzel and that Jack who climbed the beanstalk) is woven together with the characters individual quests tangling with those of the others.As the title indicates the action happens deep among the trees where bad things traditionally happen. Hansel and Gretel are not involved - not even a cameo - but maybe they should be. Sondheim Lapine (who gets a screenwriting credit here) and Marshall walk us into the woods merrily. The trick is in getting us back out carrying something worthwhile.The wrap party for Into the Woods must have been a humdinger. Heading the cast is Meryl Streep who plays a grudge-bearing witch wickedly. Shes a curse-flinger who has caused a baker and his wife to be childless. In an effort to reverse the spell the flour-happy couple goes on a whimsical scavenger hunt into the forest which is where the aforementioned Brothers Grimm all-stars come into play.The bakers wife is Emily Blunt who is delightful as the plucky and relentless better half to her indecisive bread-making husband (round of applause to actor James Corden please).Johnny Depp as the wolf whose burps smell like a grandmother has a smaller role than most of the other players but he does make an impression - an impression of rock star Jack White from the looks of it. Remember that Depps warm-water pirate Jack Sparrow was based on the Rolling Stones Keith Richards.At the screening I attended the young women in the audience laughed over and over again at Chris Pines over-the-top portrayal of Prince Charming. For me the hamming produced diminishing returns. Still there is one line from Pines Prince (who is an absolute cad) that will never get old ""I was raised to be charming not sincere.""So no the Prince is not worthy of Cinderella the beslippered ball-dancing beauty and stepchild casualty. Which is fine enough because this Cinderella - a radiant and clear-voiced Anna Kendrick - is an ambivalent one. Kendrick sings Sondheims intricate lyrics about life choices and unsure self-identity superbly ""But then how can you know/ Who you are till you know/ What you want which I dont?""Confusion then. Where traditional fairy tales spell out life in simple and certain terms Into the Woods dispels the myths. ""Witches can be right"" Cinderella and the baker sing late in the film ""giants can be good."" The song is No One Is Alone which tells us that life is hard and that decisions arent clear-cut but that ultimately were not alone in our pursuits.Life is no fairy tale thats the message. Into the Woods uses old stories for a modern memo - in its way chopping down trees to make room for a forest.

(Dont fret when Johnny Depps leering Big Bad Wolf lifts his leg to block Little Red Riding Hoods progress; all he wants to show her is the candy under his coat Tee hee) It works well enough for the first half as the story weaves together a passel of classics into a single yarn that takes various characters into the realm of change uncertainty and possibility that is The Woods. But then into this happy fantasy comes the great buzzkill of mundane reality when you win at life who loses? Who suffers so that you may get what you want? And what happens when you get what you want and youre still unsatisfied? (""Ever after"" is an awfully long time to live happily after all.) The fairy tale endings start to unravel and The Woods become more of a swamp the drama bogs down the characters get besmirched and the best we can hope for is a murky lesson in the difficulty of making family fare out of a cautionary tale for parents. The haunting line Careful the things you say children will listen... might well be rendered Careful the films you see children are watching... But if you dont mind a little subversion the songs are catchy and the cast -- notably Emily Blunt as the Bakers wife Anna Kendrick as Cinderella and Chris Pine as Prince Charming -- is fine. 2014. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it From the director of ""Chicago"" ""Into the Woods"" is a musical fantasy that intertwines the plots of various classic fairy tales to highlight the consequences of characters wishes and quests (Walt Disney Pictures) By Stephanie Merry December 23 2014 Follow stephmerry Fans of the Tony Award-winning musical ""Into the Woods"" were fairly horrified about a Disney-produced movie adaptation. Imaginations ran wild at the prospect of what might get cut from the original an intricate fable that thumbed its nose at ""happily ever after"" and embraced the grimmest of Grimms fairy tales. First the good news Despite some streamlining for time and ratings purposes director Rob Marshalls adaptation is not all kids stuff with singing teapots and friendly mice. There are plenty of dark detours. And the bad news? The thing that made the 1987 Broadway production by Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine somewhat problematic -- its sprawling array of characters running on a hamster wheel of plot points -- is still here too. Yes the concept is clever the performances are strong and the music is brilliant. But theres something conspicuously missing amid all the chaos a heart. A jumble of interconnected stories are framed by the tale of a baker and his wife. The couple played by James Corden and Emily Blunt are desperate for a child but unable to conceive because of a curse placed on the family by their next-door neighbor a grotesque witch (Meryl Streep). The only way to break the spell is to do the bidding of the witch and collect ingredients for a magic potion a cow as white as snow a cape as red as blood yellow hair the color of corn and a gold slipper. And of course theres a tight timeline. The couple has three days to collect the odd assortment of objects. So off they go into the woods where their search brings them into contact with Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford) Cinderella (Anna Kendrick) Rapunzel (Mackenzie Mauzy) Jack of beanstalk fame (Daniel Huttlestone) and other fairy tale mainstays -- evil stepmothers princes that kind of thing. On this journey the baker and his wife are looking for their happy ending and so is everyone else. But the movie just like the original is less concerned with tidy resolutions and more interested in what happens after that.

Caption Check out our holiday movie superlatives. Most likely to make you want to learn the lyrics so you can sing along next time ""Into the Woods"" Stephen Sondheim and James Lapines Broadway musical is a complicated and rather dark affair in which the heroes of various fairy tales cross paths in a forest. You can bet this new adaptation courtesy of Disney will be both simplified and slightly more family-friendly. Regardless of how you feel about the changes great music remains -- the stage show won the Tony for best original score and best book after all -- and theres a standout cast that includes Meryl Streep (pictured) Anna Kendrick Johnny Depp and Emily Blunt. (Dec. 25. PG.) Peter Mountain/Disney Enterprises Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. The casting for the movie is outstanding. Streep is marvelous as always but in this case she outdoes even herself (and the script) by bringing a degree of poignancy to her conniving character. The populations dilemmas in this fantastical universe are resonant enough that they should stir up emotions but there are so many characters with too many problems. Cinderella isnt sure about settling down and her prince is kind of a womanizer; the witch is terrified of becoming an empty nester; and the baker and his wife are of course dealing with fertility issues. And thats just a tiny sampling. The movie strays at times from the musical but there is enough darkness to assuage the fans who feared the Disney- fying of coarser moments. Johnny Depp is uncomfortably lascivious as the wolf who wants a piece of Red Riding Hood and Cinderellas stepsisters go to great lengths to get their feet into that gold slipper. (Baby toes are extraneous anyway right?) There are some fine doses of comedy too as when two cheesy princes try to outperform each other in the duet ""Agony"" each expressing the pain of being in love. ""Agony Far more painful than yours when you know she would go with you if there only were doors"" sings Rapunzels paramour. Some of the musicals superfans will feel shortchanged by the movie no matter what but you have to give credit where its due. The adaptation is pretty faithful to the original -- for better and worse.   1/2 PG. At area theaters. Contains fantasy action peril and some suggestive material. 126 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

VPC Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 123 p.m. MST December 23 2014Director Rob Marshall brings the beloved musical a dark mash-up of fairy tales to the screen. The cast is huge and hugely talented (Meryl Streep Emily Blunt Anna Kendrick) but it delivers.Anna Kendrick stars as Cinderella in ""Into the Woods.""(Photo Peter Mountain/Disney Enterprises/AP)Story Highlights4 stars (out of 5)The cast is outstanding with everyone able to carry a tune (no small feat).Blunt is the star of the movie with the meatiest role in a large production.Corden is charming but Crawford might be the most enjoyable.You can practically hear fans of the musical version of ""Into the Woods"" sharpening their knives for the movie.Im not one of them. Then again Ive never seen Stephen Sondheim and James Lapines legendary musical onstage so I have nothing to compare it with. And in that knife-free context I liked the movie -- very much.The cast is top-notch the story is satisfyingly dark the performances are fun and of course the songs are terrific. Maybe there is some Disneyfication here and there and theres a breathtakingly dramatic shift in tone that might be tough for some people particularly younger audiences.But overall its a blast an unexpected delight for those of us who dont salivate at the prospect of musicals made into movies.The opening number is outstanding setting the stage for the rest of the film. A baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt) discover that the witch (Meryl Streep) who lives next door is the reason theyre childless thanks to a long-ago slight by the bakers father. He and his wife must go on a scavenger hunt of sorts to have a child.Little Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford) needs food for her Granny but cant stop eating it. Dim-bulb Jack (Daniel Huttlestone) has to sell his pet cow Milky White at the behest of his mother (Tracey Ullman) but will get some magic beans in return. And Cinderella (Anna Kendrick) is of course the victim of a cruel stepmother (Christine Baranski) who thinks shes unfit to attend the kings festival where the prince is looking for a bride.Not a bad start eh? In this mash-up of fairy tales everyone must venture ahem into the woods to get what they want. Their paths will cross their stories will intertwine lives will be lost songs will be sung and the old saw about everyone living happily ever after will give way to another Be careful what you wish for. You just might get it.And we havent even mentioned Chris Pine great -- seriously -- in the best self-effacing way as Prince Charming; and Johnny Depp fine suitably pervy as the Wolf.Thats a lot of story and a lot of actors most of whom get paid in the equivalent of kings ransoms to service. But director Rob Marshall (""Chicago"" ""Nine"") manages just fine. And he knows his way around a musical number. If the set occasionally looks like what it is (a sound stage) that does nothing to diminish the dreamlike quality of the production. Were in a fantasy world here after all one that is twisted in a satisfying way.There are however a few things to note. About that tonal shift The first half of the film is a giddy romp through the fairy-tale landscape a knowing poke at tropes that given the age of the original production foretold such future mash-ups as ""Shrek."" Once the characters seem to have gotten what they want however things take a decidedly darker turn. Its no less satisfying (certainly not from the song perspective) but it is a big change.As for the singing well some actors carry a note better than others but everyone gets the point across without any distracting missteps. In her early scenes Streep seems to be channeling Heath Ledger as the Joker in ""The Dark Knight"" which is nothing but a good thing. Blunt is probably the star of the show which may come as a surprise given the firepower but she gets the most emotional notes -- literally and figuratively -- to play and she makes the most of them.Corden charmingly holds his own which makes his taking over for Craig Ferguson on late-night TV all the more appealing. And Crawford as the thieving gluttonous Red (although she comes around) may give the most enjoyable performance of all.In this crowd thats saying something.Into the Woods4 stars (out of 5)Director Rob Marshall.Cast Anna Kendrick Meryl Streep Chris Pine.Rating PG for thematic elements fantasy action and peril and some suggestive material.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Peter Mountain) Photo Peter Mountain Associated Press ""Into the Woods"" review A respectable transfer from stage to screen 1 / 6 Back to Gallery Stephen Sondheims ""Into the Woods"" makes a smooth translation to the big screen in a new adaptation written by James Lapine who wrote the musicals book and directed by Rob Marshall. Faithful but not slavishly faithful to the source the movie retains most of the songs but streamlines the story particularly in the second half. The biggest change is one of tone which is partly just the result of the switch from stage to screen. Movies literalize everything so some of the whimsicality of the stage version -- the comedy the satirical edge the absurdity even the sense of ""Here we are in front of you telling you a fairy tale"" -- is lost and the story becomes more serious. But the darker tone is also clearly the directors intent and you can tell from the performances. Its one thing if the witch as played by Meryl Streep suddenly becomes a dramatic character but when Tracey Ullman a comic actress chooses to play Jacks Mother as though she were starring in ""The Grapes of Wrath"" you know someone told her to do that. Yet for the most part Marshalls approach succeeds. It might even have been the only approach that could have succeeded. A fairy tale mashup from before mashups were invented ""Into the Woods"" combines four well-known stories changing them slightly to make them all fit together. Theres Cinderella (Anna Kendrick) who doesnt quite have a fairy godmother but still gets her ball gown. Theres Little Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford) and an impoverished boy named Jack (Daniel Huttlestone) whose name will soon be linked with a beanstalk. And finally theres Rapunzel (Mackenzie Mauzy) who really needs to do something with her hair. Linking them all is the story of a baker and his wife played by James Corden and Emily Blunt who are seeking to lift a curse that is preventing them from having children. They are the heart of the movie the thing that keeps the experience from being merely clever. Those who love Sondheims music should love the treatment here. Those who dont love the music are advised to maintain a polite silence because Sondheim lovers have long since made non-lovers feel like complete ignoramuses for saying indelicate things like ""But every song sounds the same."" Actually Im told that if you listen to the soundtrack two or three (hundred) times and concentrate really hard the songs do start differentiating themselves. In any case there are always the lyrics which are the real point anyway. As conveyances for Sondheims brilliant funny and unexpected turns of phrase the songs do quite nicely. So do the singers. Streep whose ability to do everything no longer even raises an eyebrow has a strong pinging voice as the witch. More surprising is Blunts ability to carry off the shows most tender and emotional moments not just dramatically but musically. With archness and irony ""Into the Woods"" goes deeper into the fairy stories allowing us to see familiar archetypes in new and not so flattering ways. Chris Pine who doesnt just play Captain Kirk in the new ""Star Trek"" franchise but could be on his way to becoming the next William Shatner savors playing Prince Charmings fatuity and self-satisfaction. But the overall effect of the movies approach to these fairy tales though amusing has an underlying sadness built into the design. Life Sondheim and Lapine seem to be saying is less enchanted than children are led to believe. By the movies last third the point has been made and the central gimmick has begun to fray but by then ""Into the Woods"" has stored up enough goodwill to take it safely home.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet So far Rob Marshalls career as a director of movie musicals has been marked by what seems like embarrassment over the form--a particularly strange trademark given his origins as a choreographer and director of musical theater. In his film versions of both Chicago and Nine Marshall combines staginess and general remove (most of the numbers are set on minimal play-like sets and usually in the main characters head) with MTV-cutting to create a worst of both worlds musicals that are all flash and minimal cinematic invention. Into The Woods Marshalls third movie musical is based on a Steven Sondheim stage show and as such is closer to sung-through than either of his previous films. The material forces Marshall to actually integrate the music into the action with characters who really do sing to each other in a story that doesnt make clunky excuses for them to do so. It probably helps that the narrative is set at an intersection of classic fairy tales where singing doesnt feel quite so out of place even for musical-averse audiences. A witch (Meryl Streep) informs her neighbors a baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt) that she can break the curse that has left them childless if they can retrieve certain objects for her spell. This sends them into the woods and toward familiar characters like Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford) Cinderella (Anna Kendrick) and Jack (Daniel Huttlestone) of beanstalk-climbing fame.The original material by Sondheim and James Lapine (who also handled the screenplay adaptation) fractures these familiar tales to varying degrees--first slightly in allowing the characters to cross paths then more so as the story complicates the expected happily-ever-afters with disappointment and familial strife. Its a tricky balance and at times the movie tangles up Sondheim sophistication and Disney accessibility; it brings in Mouse House go-to Johnny Depp as the Big Bad Wolf for example but mutes much of the sexuality of his song ""Hello Little Girl."" By keeping it within certain boundaries the movie reduces a small but thematically rich role to an enjoyable cameo.The film version also shortens and simplifies some of the shows second act though it manages to get most of the important points across. That simplification carries over to the filmmaking too. Marshall and cinematographer Dion Beebe wield a snakier camera in place of Chicagos hyperactive cuts and several of the most important songs especially those sung by Streep and Blunt play out in a series of longer takes. The sustained shots dont call attention to themselves like the ones in Tom Hoopers Les Miserables but they do allow the emotions of actors faces to complement their singing. Throughout the film the actors enrich the adaptation Blunt has a nice voice (Sondheim fans should hold the cracks about the distinction between ""nice"" and ""good"") which she breaks into incredulous or nervous laughter at strategic moments a lovely puncturing of Broadway bombast. Streeps role initially calls for more traditional showboating which she dutifully provides before revealing greater depths of emotion later on. Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen have no such responsibilities (""I was raised to be charming not sincere"" Pines prince explains) and the two briefly steal the movie with their hilariously self-pitying lovesickness while performing ""Agony.""""Agony"" is one of the most distinct musical numbers of the film placing the princes at the top of a waterfall; its like something out of a medieval music video. Elsewhere Marshall still doesnt show much visual invention when translating a stage show to the screen. The forest environment opens up but the movie doesnt reconceive the plots coincidences which make more sense on the fixed space of a theatrical stage. The witchs repeated pop-ups where she hectors the baker and his wife about their deadline look especially staged when theyre happening on bigger more enveloping sets and the way the characters keep running past around and after each other makes the movie feel busier and less elegant than it should. Still even if this Into The Woods lacks the exhilaration of the best movie musicals it does capture the shows emotional intimacy--no small task in a field that favors razzle dazzle. The success of future Marshall musicals is assured as long as he keeps working from Sondheim and re-hires Streep Blunt Kendrick and Pine.

"Into the Woods | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; into-the-woods ) Into the Woods (United States 2014) December 22 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Into the Woods left me out in the cold. The long-gestating cinematic adaptation of Stephen Sondheims fairy tale-infused Broadway musical Into the Woods can claim a clever screenplay and a few enjoyable performances but little else. The generic musical numbers are choreographed with little in the way of verve and theres nary a catchy tune to be found. The films dearth of emotional impact is grossly apparent when characters are dispatched and no one really cares. And the small budget (reportedly about 50 million) disallows any of the visual effects to be called ""special."" Its questionable whether fans of the play are going to be thrilled with Marshalls interpretation. Not only does it elide an important character (The Narrator) but it changes the fate of another and tones down the overt sexual suggestiveness of two relationships (all in the name of family friendliness of course). Sondheim grudgingly approved the changes but the language he employed in speaking about them makes it apparent that although he recognizes the commercial necessity the artistic implications dont thrill him. The idea behind Into the Woods remains as fresh for the movie version as it was when it took the stage by storm more than 25 years ago. Four of The Brothers Grimms tales are rebooted and interwoven Cinderella (featuring Anna Kendrick in that role) Little Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford) Jack and the Beanstalk (Daniel Huttlestone) and Rapunzel (Mackenzie Mauzy). Added to these is a story that the Grimm siblings never wrote but might as well have - The Baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt) unable to have a child discover that a Witch (Meryl Streep channeling her character from The Devil Wears Prada) has placed a curse on their house. To get it removed they have three nights to go on a scavenger hunt and retrieve four items a milky white cow a blood-red cape a corn-yellow strand of hair and a golden slipper. So everyone goes into the woods interacts and comes out to live happily ever after... at least until Act II. Marshall is no neophyte when it comes to making movie musicals. In fact hes one of the few working directors who embraces the genre. His Chicago won the Oscar after all. This makes it all the more surprising how flat Into the Woods is. The animated Disney musicals of the early 90s had more life. Only one musical number the deliciously satirical ""Agony"" has the level of energy one would expect from this production and its success is due more to the way in which Chris Pine plays the scene than the staging choreography or setting of the song. Speaking of Pine (and with all apologies to the perennial Oscar nominee Meryl Streep) hes the best thing Into the Woods has to offer. His Prince Charming is the perfect mix of bluster charisma and empty-headedness. Put alongside his work in the otherwise execrable Horrible Bosses 2 hes showing genuine comedic chops. For the most part his co-stars dont fare as well. Streep is (of course) a standout but Johnny Depp appears in only one scene with a total screen time not exceeding five minutes and ""name"" actors like Anna Kendrick and Emily Blunt are given forgettable wafer-thin parts. Disney has built its animated stable in part on tweaked versions of fairy tales credited to the likes of The Grimm Brothers and Hans Christian Andersen. Two of the characters in Into the Woods are recognized Disney Princesses. (Note Although Sleeping Beauty and Snow White made brief appearances in the stage version of the play they have been deleted from the screen adaptation.) Perhaps the intention was to make this a companion piece to Maleficent - a live-adaptation reworking of popular animated fare. However where Maleficent achieved something unique and stirring Into the Woods is strangely stillborn. One wonders whether the studios need to protect the images of their property has resulted in a whitewashing of Into the Woods. In terms of its content Into the Woods may be suitable for family audiences but its hard to imagine young children having much interest in a film that is consistently dark and pauses frequently for the actors to warble forgettable tunes. Just as theres nothing terribly wrong with Into the Woods theres nothing terribly right either. Im sure it will make a lot of money - the Disney and Sondheim imprints are sufficient to guarantee a solid return on investment but as Christmas Days brightest light this bulb needs replacement.

James Corden left and Lilla Crawford as Little Red Riding Hood in a scene from Into the Woods.(Photo Peter Mountain AP)With its ominous gnarled trees and enchanted look Into the Woods is a place worth exploring.Though fans of the Broadway musical may find the screen adaptation tamped down and lacking in detail the film features stunning production design and a charming cast. The songs in this re-imagining of Grimm fairy tales are well-orchestrated and for the most part strikingly sung ( 1/2 out of four; rated PG; opens Thursday nationwide).Having adapted Chicago to the screen director Rob Marshall would seem a wise choice to helm this version of the 1987 fairy tale mash-up by Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine. But the films clashing tones -- earnest melodrama and knowing parody -- sometimes render the story disjointed.The notion that the world is a big scary place is captured with intermittent dazzle. Yearning rampant curiosity and subtle eroticism underlie the tale which is about desire and identity more than it is about fantasy.The ensemble cast includes talented comic and dramatic actors. The standout roles go to the villains Meryl Streep as the witch who stole Rapunzel and sequestered her in a tower and Johnny Depp as the leering Big Bad Wolf.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Meryl Streep plays a witch who tasks a childless baker and his wife with gathering magical items from classic fairy tales to reverse a curse put on their family tree in Into the Woods. VPCUSA TODAYSmart women go boldly Into the WoodsStreep in striking blue hair and long twisted nails is at the heart of the mayhem having dangled the promise of a baby to the childless Bakers Wife (Emily Blunt) and her husband (James Corden). Blunt brings just the right blend of poignancy and humor to her character and is also a lovely singer.Lurking in forested corners is the seductive Wolf and Depp plays him with appropriately creepy flair. He slyly approaches perky Little Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford) on her infamous journey through the woods to see her grandmother.Another treat is Anna Kendricks Cinderella who has more angst and depth than the familiar cheery Disney version. She realizes that life at the castle is too dreamy and that life as a scullery maid with her evil stepmother (Christine Baranski) and snarling stepsisters is nightmarish. Shed prefer something in between.The catchy campy song Agony as performed by dueling mincing princes Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen is the films funniest scene.USA TODAYThat time a diva cow dared to upstage Meryl StreepSondheims lyrics are wonderfully clever and studded with kernels of truth that underscore the idea that the world is a grayer murkier place than fairy tales paint it.The PG film is not as dark as the stage show though characters are blinded wounded and sometimes slain.Still the final number You are Not Alone encourages people not to jump to easy conclusions ""Witches can be right/giants can be good You decide whats right/You decide whats good Just remember someone is on your side/Someone else is not.""While it captures the notion of lost innocence the film lacks cohesion. Its a challenge to distill the stage productions nuances on screen and the conclusion feels more jumbled than moving missing some of the plays meaning.However the notion that children are raised on fairy tales and the question of how those early stories affect us all -- even into adulthood -- remains fascinating and is delivered here with visual panache and musical flair. 14 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/16JME2K",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/12/22/into-the-woods-review/19157071/,200,intothewoods30,intothewoods,usatoday

"Into the Woods review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Into the Woods Into the Woods Peter Mountain Scene from ""Into the Woods."" Scene from ""Into the Woods."" (Peter Mountain) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune The Sondheim musical finally makes it to the screen. And it works. In the generation since ""Into the Woods"" opened on Broadway the entertainment world has recycled a forests worth of enchantress-based princess-dependent and fairy tale-steeped mythology for mass consumption from Disneys ""Frozen"" and ""Maleficent"" to the smaller screens ""Grimm"" ""Once Upon a Time"" and ""Charmed."" And lets not forget the theatrical extravaganza ""Wicked"" whose anthemic full-bore sensibility and songs (full-bore in both senses) are exactly what you do not find in ""Into the Woods.""For years composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheims 1987 fairy tale mashup written with librettist James Lapine has hacked its way through the thicket of Hollywood development. And the movie now before us? Heres a relief Its good. Its also a little harried. The stage version always was heavily plotted verging on chaos and director Rob Marshall tends to push the camera too close to the bustle. But it works. Its full of wit and feeling guided by strong performers clearly devoted to the material and to Sondheims sparkling craftsmanship.By now dark-underbelly revisions of fairy tales are nothing new so that storytelling aspect of ""Into the Woods"" isnt what it once was. (Bruno Bettelheims ""The Uses of Enchantment"" was an inspiration.) But like the popular oft-revived stage version Marshalls film will likely find a wide audience ranging from kids old enough to handle a little grief with their ever-after to older folk (with or without children) whove experienced more of lifes adversities and compromises. In creating the stage show Lapine and Sondheim combined several fairy tales particularly those of the Brothers Grimm. To the tales of Cinderella Rapunzel Jack and the Beanstalk and Little Red Riding Hood they added new characters chief among them a baker (James Corden in the film terrific) and his wife (Emily Blunt also terrific). Their desire to have a child has been forestalled by a curse laid on them by the witch next door (Meryl Streep) whose back story never was the most compelling thing about ""Into the Woods."" Anatomy of a scene Into the Woods The director Rob Marshall discusses a sequence from ""Into the Woods"" where the song ""No One Is Alone"" is performed. The director Rob Marshall discusses a sequence from ""Into the Woods"" where the song ""No One Is Alone"" is performed. See more videos Little matter; Streep kills it and has serious fun with Sondheims intricate patter songs. To undo the curse baker and wife venture into the woods in search of four objects a cow as white as milk a cape as red as blood hair as yellow as corn and a slipper as pure as gold. Anna Kendrick shines as a conflicted Cinderella; Chris Pine has the great fortune to sing (with fellow prince played by Billy Magnussen) the hilariously egocentric duet ""Agony"" which got applause at the screening I attended. Daniel Huttlestone last seen singing on the barricades in ""Les Miserables"" portrays the giant-slaying Jack with Tracey Ullman as his testy careworn mother. Christine Baranski goes to town and back again as Cinderellas stepmother. Its a large ensemble constantly in motion. Latest movies reviewedOpen link Everyones wishes come true in ""Into the Woods"" but the price is steep. Jack slays the giant in the sky but the giants wife craves revenge. Cinderella gets her prince but the prince is a charming cad and at one point dallies in a PG sort of way with the bakers wife. (""This is ridiculous/ What am I doing here/ Im in the wrong story"" she talk-sings in romantic dismay.) Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford) runs afoul of the vaguely lascivious Big Bad Wolf (Johnny Depp outfitted like a zoot-suited menace) and after being eaten and then rescued she sings ""I Know Things Now"" in which Sondheim provocatively equates Reds ordeal with an uneasy awakening leaving her both ""excited"" and ""scared.""""Into the Woods"" is a diptych structured much like the Sondheim/Lapine show preceding it ""Sunday in the Park With George."" Act 1 ends with happily ever after but a portent of doom. Act 2 is laden with consequences the deaths of key characters and in the end an acknowledgment that community responsibility must be heeded and everyone must share in the joy and the hard work of living. I wish the film were 10 or 15 minutes longer; as is its a tightly packed 124 minutes but theres some connective tissue missing between the materials violent mood swings. Marshalls camera eye is more functional than inspired and too often he contents himself with scrambling after whoevers singing while skipping or running or arguing. Hes not one for careful composition. Sondheim has said the Sondheim show this most closely resembles is ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum"" with its multiple storylines crisscrossing and converging just so. But with ""Into the Woods"" its not merely comedy tonight; its comedy tonight plus tragedy tomorrow. The Sondheim melodies are meant to be skittish the way Carl Stallings music for the old Warner Brothers cartoons kept changing direction delightfully. And then just when the survivors of the story need it most along come the songs ""No One Is Alone"" and ""Children Will Listen"" to reassure the frayed nerves of both the storybook legends and the paying customers.""Into the Woods"" was a natural for the movies with its transformation scenes its jump-cut-friendly storytelling hopping from one set of characters to another and back again. The movie works best whenever Corden and Blunt performers of nearly limitless appeal and sweet-natured vulnerability take the story back from their cohorts though Kendrick is no less beguiling. I wish I could say Marshall is a savior of the screen musical but in truth though he scored with ""Chicago"" his film version of ""Nine"" wasnt much better than his nonmusicals ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean 4.""

In musical theater more emphasis is placed on singing talent and choreography than on acting and the set. People tend to go to musicals to hear the singing. Songs in musicals are more memorable and likable than dialogue in musicals. The Into the Woods song is catchy and is the highlight of the soundtrack. I have seen the play and the movie. Its also easy to paint a backdrop for a musical but anything more than that tends to run into expenses. I feel that Into the Woods though does a nice job with the balance desired in musical theater movies. The beanstalk and castles are interesting and the cast have nice singing voices. I also felt that the first half of the movie moved along at a faster pace than the second half. The part where the baker and his wife went on a quest to find the items gave the plot some movement. After everybody found their happily ever after it seemed anti-climatic. In comparison another movie musical Les Mis however ran into some problems. Les Mis had good CGI scenery like Into the Woods but ran into problems with casting choices. Russell Crowe who played one of the two main characters cant sing but he is an OK actor. Unfortunately the actors in Les Mis had to be able to sing well. On a side note it seems that there are a lot of sequels and remakes. They bring in money so thats why Hollywood makes them. There are a lot of good untold stories out there however. If you had to pick a good story for a movie what would it be? I like your videos. They remind me of Gene Siskel/Roger Ebert At The Movies. I guess you knew them and used their work as inspiration. Thanks Ryan POST A COMMENT indicates required fieldName Email Website YouTubeResponse URL  ?

The creators of the original show Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine had intended to transcend a even explode a the sugary homogenized Walt Disney treatment. Now here it is getting a full lavish Disney studio production with big-deal movie stars (Meryl Streep Emily Blunt Anna Kendrick Chris Pine Johnny Depp) and somehow working as well if not better than it did almost 30 years ago on Broadway. My euphoria lasted a long long time a| but all good things must end. Which is also the point of the musical though not quite in the way it happens here. Until its hairpin turn into the apocalyptic the material is ingenious. Sondheim and Lapine take three Brothers Grimm stories a aCinderellaa aJack and the Beanstalka and aRapunzela a and set them crisscrossing farcically in the woods yoking them together via a new tale in which a baker and his wife embark on a scavenger hunt to dispel a witchas curse that has rendered them infertile. Even fractured the fairy tales emerge with unusual clarity. (They arenat for a change padded out.) And though space onscreen is more literal than onstage director Rob Marshall and editor Wyatt Smith maintain a happy bouncing-ball fluidity aided by the composeras most dazzling fugues. Melodically this isnat top-tier Sondheim (itas like A Little Night Music without the tunes) but the harmonies are splendid and Jonathan Tunickas orchestrations a busy beautiful world unto themselves. The tempos make the special effects even more irresistible. The movie moves like a dream. Related Stories Fine the New Into the Woods Trailer Will Give You Singing Take a Look at the Into the Woods Stills Hear Meryl Streep Belt aStay With Mea From Into the Woods And most of the actors can hit the notes a hooray Not Depp whose Sweeney Todd wasnat much to sing about either but as the Big Bad Wolf he does some good fruity Hedwig-like vamping (aHello little girla) and his rasp contrasts nicely with the brassy Ethel Mermanalike sounds coming out of Little Red (Lilla Crawford). The Cockney Jack (Daniel Huttlestone) recalls Jack Wildas Artful Dodger in the nicest way and Tracey Ullman is inventive enough to keep his mom from being too much of a screeching pain. As Cinderella Kendrick has a crystalline soprano (she kills it in the upcoming film of The Last 5 Years) and though sheas a little morose her relatability quotient is off the charts a you can picture her at a mixer tentatively sipping punch and wondering why sheas there. I do wish she matched up better with Pineas amusingly fancy-pants frat-boy Prince. (Would he really be turned on by such a modern bundle of neuroses?) Their union is meant to be dashed but it would be good to buy into the illusion for a spell. And Streep? Her singing is good if a little thin but itas the one weapon in her superhuman arsenal she canat fully control a you see the occasional flicker of uncertainty. At her best though sheas like Andrea Martinas Edith Prickley from SCTV with superpowers a gloriously terrifying vision. The good-hearted plodder of a baker and his goosey wife are the real protagonists of Into the Woods and theyare all you could hope for here. James Corden is a wonderfully funny self-effacing bloke a Iam thrilled at the prospect of seeing him nightly hosting his own show after Colbert. Maybe heall have Emily Blunt as a guest. Itas her movie. Dizzy pop-eyed blurty she gives this unwieldy saga its daft farcical heart. Without her it would be a| Well thereas the rub. I didnat think the show fully earned its slap-in-the-face second act onstage either but in a Sondheim musical you donat expect happily-ever-afters; and it was after all 1987 near the peak of the AIDS crisis when the brief fairy-tale era of gay liberation had been cruelly snuffed out. (Sondheim has downplayed the AIDS connection preferring crises in which humans bear direct responsibility like global warming.) For a 1987 Broadway crowd Sondheim and Lapine could get away with their sour sentimentality and what really amounts to a colossal failure of imagination. They canat here. In a Disney movie opening Christmas Day and pitched to the whole family the wave of awful things just seems bewilderingly mean a a sucker punch to kids who did nothing except hope for a story in which wishes do after the requisite pain and sacrifice come true. Iam only half-kidding when I suggest that you see the movie but leave (especially if you have kids) at whatas obviously the end of the first act. Youall still get the dissonances ambiguities and portents of doom along with much that is pure enchantment. And you wonat leave thinking the movie had been made by the Big Bad Wolf.

(Peter Mountain/AP) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday December 18 2014 852 PM Title Into the Woods Film Info Musical fairy tale with Grimm undertones. Director Rob Marshall (204). PG Death peril mature themes. Area theaters. Opens Wednesday night. Its exciting enough that ""Into the Woods"" mixes a whole roster of storybook celebrities into one movie. Better still actors like Meryl Streep Johnny Depp Emily Blunt and Anna Kendrick are playing the all-stars. Director Rob Marshall (""Chicago"" ""Nine"") has affectionately adapted Stephen Sondheims 1987 Broadway musical which blended classic famous Grimm-tale characters into a slyly modern fable. At the center are the childless Baker (James Corden) and his Wife (Blunt) who ask a cruel Witch (Streep) to help them become parents. She sends them into the forest for items to break a curse that it turns out she originally cast. While theyre looking they come across Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford too young) and a very menacing Wolf (Depp too broad); a beanstalk-obsessed Jack (Daniel Huttlestone) and his frustrated Mother (Tracey Ullman); imprisoned Rapunzel (Mackenzie Mauzy); and a disappointed Cinderella (Kendrick) who finds that life with Prince Charming (Chris Pine) isnt all she expected. Loyal fans of the Sondheim original may feel a bit let down themselves. Theres much to love here. But working with original ""Woods"" writer and Sondheim collaborator James Lapine Marshall tones down the crucial dark shading in some places and has trouble with pacing in others. Still the life lessons are delivered with insight and heart the rightfully beloved music is well handled and the cast is so enthusiastic that we can excuse some rough patches. Streep is marvelous digging into her role with such relish we adore even her wickedness. Kendrick is especially lovely when she sings and Blunt finds wrenching range in the Wifes dilemma. Among the men Pine and Billy Magnussen as Rapunzels rescuer provide a highlight with their droll duet ""Agony."" In less than 30 years Sondheims work has aged into a classic that still feels contemporary. Marshall is about to introduce ""Into the Woods"" to a whole new generation which feels likes the best sort of happily-ever-after.

"Review Into the Woods impressive but a bit too tame - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Into the Woods impressive but a bit too tameBy Karen DSouzakdsouzamercurynews.comPosted 12/18/2014 034836 PM PSTUpdated 12/22/2014 090237 AM PST Happily ever after fights back in ""Into the Woods."" Stephen Sondheims beloved musical -- which turns once upon a time upside down in a fantastical mashup of such fairy tales as ""Little Red Riding Hood"" ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" ""Rapunzel"" and ""Cinderella"" -- has made it to the big screen. The gorgeously glossy but also surprisingly choppy adaptation of the iconic Broadway play seems tailor-made for the family-friendly market. That is both a blessing (if youve got little tykes in tow) and a curse alas. Directed by Rob Marshall (""Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides --Chicago"") this faithful adaptation tries to honor the bewitching spirit of the original but cant resist a certain Disney middlebrow-ness toning down the very edge that makes Sondheim (""Sweeney Todd"") such a genius. The big-budget holiday movie the lore of a childless couple wishing for a baby opens Christmas Day. Its the darkness of the forest that gets lightened and brightened here the stinging realization that even good people do awful things and that some monsters cannot be beaten. Sometimes you lose your way in the woods and there is no storybook ending coming. This movie always seems to distance itself from that existential truth that was at the core of Sondheims original. Straying from the path lands a little girl with a blood-red cape (Lilla Crawford) into the jaws of the wolf (Johnny Depp) and sets up Cinderellas prince (Chris Pine) for a moral slip. A taste for adventure is also what leads Cinderella (a one-note Anna Kendrick) into chaos.Advertisement If the characters feel a little shallow here and the narrative lacks a natural sense of flow theres no denying the visual splendor of this journey into the woods full of towering castles magic beanstalks and galumphing giants. Indeed the director leans too heavily on special effects particularly in the giant scenes when deepening the emotional connections in the movie would cast a far more powerful spell on the audience. Certainly there are plenty of juicy bits here such as Meryl Streeps tour de vamp as the gleefully glam blue-haired wicked witch. She brings a gravitas to ""Last Midnight"" thats moving and she imbues the movie with some much-needed honesty and nuance. For the record she may not be Bernadette Peters (the original witch) but she can sing. Kendrick on the other hand doesnt have a light enough touch with the playful ""On the Steps of the Palace."" Depps campy Big Bad Wolf is a hoot leering at the little girl he longs to gobble up. He could turn up the ferociousness a tad but hes far better at capturing the spirit of the original musical than many of the actors here.Emily Blunt makes a fetching bakers wife and James Corden who starred in ""One Man Two Guvnors"" on the London stage brings the put-upon baker an unassuming charm. While the movie doesnt delve deeply enough into their wistfulness over being childless theres a warm sense of chemistry between them. Christine Baranski has a ball as the evil stepmother and Pine nearly steals the show with a Shatnerian bit of preening in ""Agony.""Still theres a flatness to the characters and a slowness to the pacing that undercuts the emotional power of such songs such as ""No One Is Alone."" If we dont have anything invested in the bond between Jack (Daniel Huttlestone) and his mother (Tracey Ullman) or the baker and his wife its hard to muster up much caring when those relationships are imperiled by various and sundry fairy tale creatures. Also Rapunzel (a less-than-nuanced Mackenzie Mauzy) doesnt appear to die in this version and a certain al fresco sexual indiscretion gets tamed to the point of silliness. Marshall is no stranger to adapting stage works for the big screen and the tweaks and compromises that this demands but both of these changes diminish the storys power. Although this ""Into the Woods"" has its enchanting moments its just not as magical as it should be.Contact Karen DSouza at 408-271-3772.

Well after seeing Johnny Depp as the leering predatory Big Bad Wolf ask Little Red Riding Hood ""And what might be in your basket?"" they should put their worries aside. Whether the rest of Rob Marshalls musical measures up to the lip-smacking subversive fun of that moment is another question. For the uninitiated Into the Woods is a winking mash-up of some of our most beloved fairy tales including Cinderella Rapunzel and Jack and the Beanstalk. And since its a Sondheim joint its stuffed cheek by jowl with songs so infectiously peppy youll be humming them for weeks. But as a movie it ends up being too much of a good thing. The marquee attraction of course is Meryl Streep as a singing witch. The good news is she not only looks like shes having a blast shes far better belting show tunes in a fright wig and crones putty than she was without them in Mamma Mia But the show really belongs to James Corden (a Tony winner for One Man Two Guvnors) and Emily Blunt as his-and-hers bakers whose quest to track down a laundry list of mystical doodads like Little Reds cape and Jacks white cow drives the plot. Theyre not just adorable in their desire to reverse the witchs curse and start a family theyve also got impressive pipes. As for the rest of the cast we already knew that Anna Kendrick (as Cinderella) could sing but who could have guessed Chris Pine could too -- all while hilariously sending up his hunky image as a charmingly insincere prince? He looks like he just waltzed in from a Siegfried amp; Roy tribute act. The first two-thirds of the film which are like the Brothers Grimms Greatest Hits on laughing gas have a fizzy fairy-dust energy. But as soon as the baker couples scavenger hunt is over and a rampaging giant appears Woods loses its magic and momentum and sags like an airless balloon. For a movie so hip to the conventions of fairy tales it sure doesnt know when to cut to happily ever after.

Now comes the movie version and its a singing and dancing manifestation of both of those ideas. Fans of the show finally get to see Stephen Sondheim and James Lapines wonderful fable brought to the big screen with the great score (mostly) intact and performed by a (mostly) perfect cast. Then there are the parts that dont work and those missteps turn out to be very much a reflection of who fulfilled the wish of making the film Disney and director Rob Marshall. More on them in a moment. See video Fairy Tales Collide and Sing in Disneys Star-Studded Into the Woods Trailer In this fairy-tale mashup a childless baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt) learn that their inability to reproduce dates back to a curse that the witch next door (Meryl Streep) placed on the bakers father. He crept into her garden and stole not only greens but also her magic beans and shes willing to reverse the curse if the Baker can supply her with four items that will allow her to cast a spell. Those items involve other residents of the kingdom the crimson cloak belonging to Little Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford); the white cow that Jack (Daniel Huttlestone ""Les Miserables"") must take to market at the insistence of his mother (Tracey Ullman); the blonde hair that grows all the way down the height of the tower where Rapunzel (Mackenzie Mauzy) has spent her life imprisoned by the witch; and the beautiful golden slipper that Cinderella (Anna Kendrick) wears to the kings festival after wishing at her mothers gravesite. The journey into the deep dark woods is a life-changing one not just for the baker and his wife -- who keep finding then losing then finding the items they need -- but for the other characters as well. For Cinderella its a chance to defy her cruel stepmother (Christine Baranski who else?); Jack who trades his cow to the baker for magic beans has an adventure high atop a beanstalk; and Little Red Riding Hood has a memorable encounter with a wolf (Johnny Depp) who seductively hides his dastardly intentions. The first half of ""Into the Woods"" follows the pursuit of ""happily ever after"" but the second half asks what comes after and at what price do we pursue our wishes and wonders whether we should have wished for those things in the first place. Its a tricky shift in tone but screenwriter James Lapine nails the transition as skillfully on screen as he did in the original stage production. Its the Stephen Sondheim songs of course that have played such a key role in making ""Woods"" such a beloved theatrical standard and theyre performed skillfully here for the most part. Sondheims compositions demand a lot from performers who have to have the pipes to handle the intricate music but also the ability to race through the witty verbal gymnastics of his lyrics. Streep to no ones surprise rises to the challenge as does the theatrically trained Kendrick (whose first screen appearance involved tearing into Sondheims ""Ladies Who Lunch"" in the movie ""Camp"" when the actress was just in her mid-teens). See photos 10 Eye-Popping Into the Woods Character Posters Anna Kendrick Chris Pine Emily Blunt The unexpected standouts here are Blunt who manages the songs the comedy and the despair of the bakers wife with utter brilliance and Chris Pine (channeling all the inner Shatner that hes kept out of the ""Star Trek"" movies) and Billy Magnussen (""Damsels in Distress"") as the charming princes whose duet on ""Agony"" is a comic highlight. Preening pouting and posing their way through a catalog of angst these two showboat like contestants in a Fabio-hosted reality show dance-off. The places where ""Into the Woods"" falls short feel like the result of Disney corporate tinkering. For one thing Rapunzel comes to a far more blandly happy ending than her stage counterpart; one imagines bean-counters in Burbank concerned that leaving the character to her original fate might dig into the profits of ""Tangled 3"" or the sales of princess dresses. (Theres also no ""Agony"" reprise apparently to let two other Disney princesses remain unblemished by the proceedings.) Then theres the miscasting of Crawford and Huttlestone Both actors are so young that it removes the undercurrent of sexual awakening from the piece. This isnt a from-left-field reading of the material either; when Red Riding Hood sings about being ""excited and scared"" by her encounter with the Wolf or Jack mentions the giant breast of the woman in the sky you dont have to be Bruno Bettelheim to connect the dots. Also read Stephen Sondheim Changes His Tune on Disneys Into the Woods After Seeing Movie Onstage Jack matures from being a young dolt to a slightly less dense young man after his sojourn in the sky; his movie counterpart starts out as a brash gee-whiz song-belting ""Newsies"" auditioner and then doesnt change noticeably after climbing the beanstalk. And while Crawford doesnt have Huttlestones annoying sing-to-the-back-mezzanine demeanor shes still a few years too young for her interactions with the Wolf to have the required resonance. Depp for his part finally has a role that can accommodate all the wacky tics hes brought to every screen performance of late. (Fans of the show who worried about specific changes Stephen Sondheim Blames Puritanical Ethics For Disney Into the Woods Changes"" href=""http//www.thewrap.com/stephen-sondheim-on-into-the-woods-disney-rob-marshall/"" target=""_blank""gt;hinted at by Sondheim in a New Yorker interview earlier this year can relax and if that interview was Sondheims way of making the studio keep some of the darker material then more power to him.) Marshall deserves credit for knowing how to shoot and cut (alongside editor Wyatt Smith ""Thor The Dark World"") a musical number and his work here ranks much closer to his success with ""Chicago"" than to his dismal ""Nine."" As with both of those previous musicals however Marshall has a tendency to make the film feel exceedingly claustrophobic even when its set almost entirely outdoors. The closed-in feeling worked for ""Chicago"" -- the whole movie is supposed to be unspooling inside the feverish imagination of Roxie Hart after all -- but then completely sunk ""Nine.""  Yes the woods should be foreboding and dank but the setting never feels subsuming (as in say Neil Jordans ""The Company of Wolves"" a much more highly sexualized take on the Red Riding Hood story) nor does it feel organically spacious; with few exceptions the woods just feel like a set so small that its hemming in the action rather than a thicket thats entrapping the characters. Overall however ""Into the Woods"" does justice to the extraordinary source material and it allows its seasoned ensemble (which also includes Lucy Punch and Tammy Blanchard as Cinderellas wicked stepsisters) the chance to dig into the memorable songs and the clever wordplay. It might not be everything that fans had wished for over the years but as both Sondheim and Mick Jagger have taught us you cant always get what you want. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

""Be careful what you wish for"" warn the ads for ""Into the Woods"" -- an apt summary of the movies theme and also the mindset of many a Stephen Sondheim fan ever since it was announced that the composers popular 1987 Broadway musical was being turned into a film. But such fears are swiftly allayed by director Rob Marshall who um marshals Sondheims cavalcade of fairy-tale all-stars on to the screen in a faithful never particularly inspired but supremely respectable version -- one that outclasses Marshalls prior ""Chicago"" and ""Nine"" to say nothing of this seasons two-ton musical monstrosity ""Annie."" Strong reviews and family appeal should earn Disney much more than a bunch of magic beans at the holiday box office with a long shelf life to follow. It certainly took Hollywood long enough  to see the forest for the trees where ""Into the Woods"" was concerned. A film version was first bandied about in the mid-90s at Sony (with Goldie Hawn Cher and Steve Martin among the potential cast) then put into development deep-freeze for the next two decades. During that time ""Woods"" was revived twice on the New York stage (including director Timothy Sheaders brilliant open-air production in Central Park in 2012) and could be felt as an influence on the ""Shrek"" movies and (especially) Disneys ""Enchanted."" But the announcement that Disney was finally making ""Woods"" still brought with it no shortage of anxieties (some fueled by a misquoted Sondheim interview) namely that the Mouse House would sand down the less family-friendly elements of the show including its lascivious pederast wolf an episode of marital infidelity and a second-act body count to rival Sondheims own ""Sweeney Todd."" For all those reasons and more the chief virtue of this ""Into the Woods"" is a feeling of relief. Marshall hasnt made one of the great movie musicals here but he hasnt bungled it either -- far from it. Aficionados who know the show by heart will fully recognize what they see here (and actually be able to see it after the frantic seizure-inducing editing of ""Chicago"" and ""Nine"") while new audiences will more than get the gist a touch condensed and Disneyfied perhaps but to little overall detriment. If so much as one tween viewer adds Sondheim to his or her iPod playlist alongside the likes of ""Let it Go"" all will have been worthwhile. Taking greater inspiration from ""The Uses of Enchantment"" author Bruno Bettelheim than from Uncle Walt Sondheim and book writer James Lapine (who also earns a screenplay credit here) pluck a dozen or so characters from the iconic fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm add in a few of their own invention and set them on a tragicomic collision course in which ""happily ever after"" comes with a litany of fine-print conditions. The lineup includes a humble baker (the very appealing James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt) whose bake shop is frequented by a bratty shoplifting Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford) and who live next door to a haggard old witch (Meryl Streep) with many axes to grind. Long ago the witch abducted the bakers infant sister Rapunzel (MacKenzie Mauzy) and cursed the baker himself with sterile genes -- punishment for the sins of his estranged father (who stole magic beans from the witchs garden once upon a time). But the curse can be reversed the witch announces provided the baker and his wife procure the necessary ingredients in the span of 72 hours a cow as white as milk a cape as red as blood hair as yellow as corn and a slipper as pure as gold. It is that quest which leads the childless couple into said woods and into contact with all manner of fellow travelers running to or away from something the farm boy Jack (Daniel Huttlestone) reluctantly off to market to sell his beloved but milk-dry cow; Cinderella (Anna Kendrick) giving chase to a confounded Prince Charming (Chris Pine); and Little Red herself weighing mothers advice about strangers against the dandyish charms of a certain Mr. Wolf (a lip-smacking Johnny Depp in slanted fedora and a kind of hirsute smoking jacket). For Sondheim and Lapine these woods are as much a psychological space as a physical one -- an existential crucible where innocence is lost wisdom gained and the difficulty felt of walking a mile in someone elses shoes be they golden or giant-sized. Freed from the literal belly of the beast Red Riding Hood sings that her lupine adventure made her feel scared yes but also excited before concluding ""Isnt it nice to know a lot?/And a little bit not."" Meanwhile after her own illicit wooded liaison the bakers wife wonders ""Is it always or?/Is it never and?"" -- one of those deceptively simple Sondheim lyrics that feels like a definitive expression of lifes unending compromise. Marshall whos never seemed to know quite what to do with a movie camera and an editing machine is helped considerably here by the fact that ""Woods"" (unlike his previous musical films) has no major dances to flash-cut into incoherence. And where both ""Chicago"" and ""Nine"" labored to present their musical numbers as fantasy sequences lest multiplex-goers be alarmed by the sight of actors suddenly bursting into song ""Woods"" harbors no such concerns embracing its theatricality down to the smallest details of costume and set design. (""The trees are just wood"" Sondheims characters sing but the ones in Marshalls film care of production designer Dennis Gassner look closer to fiberglass.) Were a long -- and probably wise -- way here from the bigger-budget version of the film originally proposed complete with elaborate creature effects from the Jim Henson workshop. The movie doesnt need the extra razzle-dazzle because the real magic is there in Sondheims music which Marshall allows to come through mostly unimpeded (save for a few deleted reprises) in Jonathan Tunicks marvelous original orchestrations conducted by longtime Sondheim collaborator Paul Gemignani. Both men also worked on Tim Burtons 2007 film version of ""Sweeney Todd"" (starring Depp as the eponymous demon barber) a stylistically bolder and more accomplished film than ""Into the Woods."" If comparisons must be made however then ""Woods"" is the better sung of the two by a generally superb cast who catch the tricky tonal shifts from cheeky satire to pathos and back again. Decked out with a long gray mane and a face of Grand Canyon crags Streep brings a most amusing petulance to the witch (whom Bernadette Peters played as more of a cloying Jewish mother in the original Broadway production). Pine makes for a hilariously preening clueless Prince as does Billy Magnussen as his equally charming and insincere princely brother (who longs for fair Rapunzel). Their witty duet ""Agony"" performed in the midst of a babbling brook is one of the films most dynamic numbers. But as onstage the richest part here is that of the bakers wife a loyal helpmeet who cant help but wonder if shes cut out for grander things and who pays dearly for that curiosity. And Blunt (once again under Streeps thumb as in ""The Devil Wears Prada"") has just the right nurturing yet wistful air to make the character heartbreaking in spite of (or rather because of) her all-too-human flaws. For the screen Lapine has somewhat condensed the shows second half diluting the sense that the characters having achieved their ostensible goals by intermission still long for something more. Mostly though the second-act doozies are still here the deaths the betrayals and the buck-passing standoff with a very angry female giant (Frances de la Tour). All of that should send wise children and their parents out into the night mulling the complex nature of love and loss taking responsibility for ones own actions and the things both good and ill we pass on from one generation to the next. ""Anything can happen in the woods"" goes one Sondheim lyric and the same might be said of Hollywood musicals. Sometimes by happy luck they manage to get one right.

Higgs Boson says July 29 2015 at 1222 pm Just caught up with this at a FREE library screening. Was never so bored in my life I asked for my money back. Reply Sherry says January 30 2015 at 525 pm Did no one notice that the ""cow"" is a BULL? The only time you see the utters is in a close up. But unless I and my whole family saw wrong that white ""cow"" was a BULL in every other scene when you see the whole animal. Reply Richard Malzahn says January 21 2015 at 1046 am I am not going to critique this film because I think Mr. Foundas has already done that in his own way. I am though going to critique the critique but only on a single point. Critiques are really nothing more than (hopefully) informed opinions. Maybe Mr. Foundas has no children thus his use of the completely incorrect term ""family appeal"" used in the first paragraph. Because I knew nothing about the production prior to taking my 8 year old to see the film I relied on reviews. This turned out to my mistake. From the pedophile wolf (played by Johnny Depp) to Jacks harsh and abusive mother to the blissfully unfaithful newlyweds this movie seems to glorify the dark sides of our relationships leaving unwitting parents left to sort out the inevitable and uncomfortable questions while leaving the theater. Not unlike Rango I thought the film was completely inappropriate for a PG rating and would recommend against it to parents of younger children. Im not sure why Disney has decided to market this as a family film but based on other parental reviews Ive seen Im not the only one who feels this way. I made a mistake taking my kid to see this and Ill be more careful next time. Reply Heinz Otto says January 16 2015 at 635 pm Worst movie Ive ever seen. Reply Susu.ro says January 16 2015 at 929 am I avoided reading any reviews before seeing this film so Id have no expectations or prejudices. And in the opening moments I thought Id been rewarded. This was clearly nothing typical from Hollywood. The characters in period dress singing their dialog and the surprise of seeing Tracey Uhlman I was delighted to see her attached to this project. It bode well The camera focused on the actors and not the CGI. Since I knew nothing of the story I wondered if it would be another LES MISERABLES. But as it unfolded the ""sing-song"" lyrics that I hoped would evolve into grand musical numbers got a bit tiresome and a slow leak began to hiss from my enthusiasm. It needed more...something. OK so weve been introduced to childhood fairy tale themes and maybe theyre going to weave them together somehow. Well they attempted to but not in an imaginative way. Merle Streep as the witch. I thought there might have been a dash of Margaret Hamilton in her initial appearance but no...Streep was taking it elsewhere. The first glimmer of genuine music came with Johnny Depp as The Big Bad Wolf. Cheesy makeup but I can overlook that the scene still works. I thought Chris Pine as the Prince was the stand-out performance. My guess is that this characterization is what the screenwriters had in mind for the entire project...funny hammy over the top but enjoyable. And consistent. But the other characters with their occasional surprisingly bad dialog never attained it. Streeps performance became irritating. The other characters bounced between light comedy and out-of-place drama. I gave up any hope of this being an actual musical and over half-way through the sing-songy dialog ceased all together for no apparent reason. It was like the assistant director took over while the big guy went to lunch. Eventually we the audience stumbled out of a forest of confusion and see what looks like the end of the story. I resisted looking at my watch the whole time and thought well that wasnt bad but...wrong. The story plunged back into an irritating forest of heavy-handed seriousness with thorns of what again attempted to be musical dialog. I had had enough. This could have been spin on the PRINCESS BRIDE but it got LOST (somewhere) IN TRANSLATION. On the plus side I was impressed that this thing got the green light from an industry that loves formulaic stories that at least promise to get production costs back. I hope they will with this one. Thirty minutes too long and btw...Stephen Sondheim? Really? Reply Morag Hagan says January 9 2015 at 1106 am I wandered into cinema on a post hurricane  Scottish afternoon with no notion of what was to come. well I was very pleasantly surprised by the fact it was a musical great cast full of fun and wonderment what a lovely way to spend a dreich Friday Reply Emery says January 7 2015 at 1024 am The Producers Notebook Wondered for months why trailers for a musical included no music...Except for Blunt the casting so far off-base wondered if cast put together during drunken late-night poker game with actors being used instead of poker chips...Kid actors? LRRHood expressiveness coulda been replaced by a potato with 2 eyes. Boy? Charisma/looks of an ""Oliver"" background imp from 1968. That hat And for Sondheim story on kids - (""Children will listen..."") you gotta have kids with chops. Not gonna go into Depp who is shoe-horned into ""Woods"" about as smoothly as Damon was in ""Interstellar."" Then theres Streep...mistakenly thought she was auditioning for that Off-Broadway Imelda Marcos musical. (Merly - get those upper teeth adjusted - we who are close to the details notice - and those problematic esses were noticeable.) Costumes ill-advised. Ragbin throw-off plus prom dress rejects. Production design all shadows and fog. (Woody already did that film.) The eggheads critique Sondheim/Lapines production was self-aware presentation to theatregoers - asides to audience from narrator etc. Marshall forgoes breaking the third wall. Understandable. Its Disney. But Marshall kills off ""Woods"" as sure as they kill the giants. Throughout the libretto and lyrics are the stringent lines tossed off by characters reflecting the irony or ridiculousness of their choices or situations. Often they are some of the strongest jokes. And in every case Marshall had them shot and delivered as if they were inconsequential bon mots. (Another ""Interstellar"" analogy Like having McConaughey mumblecore his way through an explanation of why they were going into space.) Without this underlying perspective of astringency and self-knowledge were left with the action on the surface. ""Into The Woods"" timeless beauty is its knowing blend of loss melancholy hope and joy. The Producers Score Hit 56% of films full potential. Reply Michael Zand says January 5 2015 at 444 pm Scott Foundas review seem more intent on showing us how smart and erudite he is rather than reviewing this film. He says Marshall hasnt made a ""great"" film but an okay one. I wonder A What Scott Founds version of a ""great"" Into the Woods would be and B Has Scott Foundas ever directed or created anything that might be considered great? Im guessing no. Reply Maureen says January 4 2015 at 128 pm This movie was terrible. It pulls a full vacuum. I have enjoyed visits to the move. When my iguana nearly bit my thumb off I had more enjoyment than this movie. I cannot remember when I have seen a worse movie. I wish I could unsee it. Reply Michael Zand says January 5 2015 at 442 pm Youre clearly an idiot. Reply Morag Hagan says January 9 2015 at 1110 am You pull a vacuum. Lexy says January 2 2015 at 440 pm All of you guys need to calm down. Its a musical. Of course theres going to be constant singing. From this review Im not sure if you thought it was good or it was bad but it was a horrible stage to movie adaptation. Way too many songs/scenes were cut out of it. The actors in this movie did an amazing job and I loved their performances but as a whole the stage production is much better. Everything was much more slowed down and it made a lot more sense. They cut too much out so everything was sped up and didnt really make sense how they got from one place to the other. Ive loved this play since I was 3 years old. I dont understand why you all are hating on it and calling it ""torture to watch"" because it really wasnt. It seems like you guys only hate it because it was a musical. I personally loved Chicago and there wasnt anything wrong with the editing or how it was put together. I honestly think it was better put together than this movie. This play is very complicated and has a lot going on and by cutting so much of it out they just made it more and more confusing. Yes this is a dark musical but its about fairy tales its fictional. It shouldnt be taken so seriously. Grimm fairy tales are dark and previous disney movies made them happier and not so dark but Grimm fairy tales was the original version that was marketed to kids. In other countries they market dark things to their children to scare them into being careful about the world. Literally so many dark things are happening in this world and are plastered in the media and you think that this play is ""too dark""? This world is disturbing and dark and children need to learn to be careful. Wouldnt you want your child to know about the dangers of this world so they dont go in blindly and get caught in them? Reply louis says December 30 2014 at 932 pm You are clearly a stupid little bitch who knows nothing about film...where do you get off saying this snarky shit about this director when you have made nothing? Can you name a better musical film of the last 20 years than this guy has made? You are pathetic while being inarticulate.....as Spencer Tracey says in Bad Day At Black Rock "" youre wrong at the top of your voice""...shame on you...go back to school and learn to watch and write about movies ..... Reply Nan Carrington says December 30 2014 at 546 am Dark and disturbing. I think there were 5 deaths in all infidelity body mutilation physical assault 3 children lost their mothers. This level of trauma is not put into the movie by sheer coincidence. There is a great deal of trauma and it was marketed to children. People need to wake up and understand the basics of Neurolinguistic programming and how it is affecting our children and our societies. This film is dark and extremely disturbing. Not to mention the music was pure torture to listen to. I will not be attending any more Disney Films. They have no moral grounding as far as Im concerned and I seriously question their intentions in regards to their young audience. Reply Maureen says January 4 2015 at 146 pm You must be a democrat. No one else would be so rude to another poster except a complete idiot such as yourself. The movie was pitiful and you are even more so. Reply Maureen says January 4 2015 at 148 pm Nan...my comment was for the ahole Louis. Carol Mars says January 1 2015 at 942 pm This Sondheim musical was based on Grimms Fairy Tales. Those were some pretty scary tales meant to warn and educate children and their parents about the evils of the world. Be cautious...thats the whole point of the fairy tales. Reply Catherine Pierce says December 29 2014 at 320 pm Im a lover of musicals and I loved this one. Even if I do have the phrase ""Into the woods into the woods..."" running through my head all day I dont care still loved it Reply Chris Rosa says December 28 2014 at 806 pm ""Into the Woods"" the movie is one of the most epic musical blunders in cinematic history. It was torture to watch and a waste of time. Im disgusted with these sycophants not telling the truth about this awful movie. Its a facade that looks so pretty big studio big names big money based on successful Broadway play and they still couldnt create anything watchable. Rob Marshall got nothing right. 1/3 of the theater walked walked out before it ended thats a fact. If you want to waste your precious time and money then this is the movie for you Reply snyc says December 26 2014 at 1050 pm Im not sure if I saw the same movie as the others who posted comment. I saw a magical movie superbly acted and very well sung. Id seen the play in New York years ago with Bernadette Petersand I absolutely loved this movie. I saw it with some very seasoned theater and movie people none of whom are in the entertainent business all of whom see lots and lots of movies and theater..and we ALL loved it. Reply Madalyn says December 26 2014 at 644 pm This movie was so bad...It was painful to sit through it. Reply Marco says December 25 2014 at 1052 pm Walked out after 20 min. Epically boring and tangential music. Boring lyrics. Great cast. All five of us agreed we prefer home than sitting through this hell. Reply Manuel says February 14 2015 at 933 pm Boring lyrics? Whats your idea of great interesting lyrics? Oh I know...""its all about dat bass..."" Youre clearly a 2 dimensional moron. Reply David says December 24 2014 at 915 pm Just walked out of the 7pm xmas eve showing. Never have walked out of a movie before. lasted 45 minutes and that was to long. Reply loco73 says December 20 2014 at 1142 pm No thank you... will stay away from another Disney souless montrosity. Disney has surely learned a very important lesson...how to destroy movies. ""Prince Of Persia"" ""John Carter"" and ""The Lone Ranger"" are just some of the colosal failures that one would think would make them stop...but no not Disney. And if they cannot get their hands on something they destroy it by proxy purchased Pixar and sucked the life out of the company purchased Marvel and despite the initial and current box office success those meandering ""super-hero"" movies have all become budget bloated one-note CGi and special effects ladden vomit fests. If one or more fail at the box office the current love affair between Disney and Marvel will end rather quickly... And now in a bid to completely traumatize all fandoms they have picked Star Wars fans...as Darth Disney managed to push an irrelevant and bloated Lucas to sell his entire Empire to them.. choosing Jar Jar Abrams to head a new nauseating attempt to suck the last embers of life left in the ""Star Wars"" franchise and see if they could squeeze a few more dollars in order to cover all their other costly mistakes.. I wonder if a year from now after people will have their hearts ripped out and crapped upon by Jar Jar Abramss fetid take on ""Star Wars"" complete with lensflares and lack of anything approaching substance enraged ""Star Wars"" fans will mount a full frontal assault on Darth Disney one that would make the Rebel Alliance proud and finally pulverise out of existence a company started by well known anti-Semite and all around biggot Walt Disney...hmmm we shall see Basically what I am saying...yeah...I dont think I will be going to see ""Into The Woods""... Still after that entire rant I will give Darth Disney one consolation marker at least they are not Sony... Reply Alice M says December 25 2014 at 224 pm Oh give it a rest. People like you are who ruin fandoms not movie studios. Film audiences change. Different mediums require different considerations. Its the same as Star Trek fans complaining about Abrams Star Trek. I have watched Star Trek my entire life and the movie reboot is just fine. Its not the same no but its not intended to be. Its geared towards a new crowd of movie goers. It is under new direction and vision. There are new techniques available to be used (and sometimes abused). You cant expect movies to be the same as 20 years ago Thats insane. Its the same thing as complaining how theres no AC/DC on the radio anymore. Stop going into movies with some builtup preconception of exactly how you want the movie to be. Stop looking to be insulted. Dont be the movie hipster who hates big cinema because capitalism sucks and movie crowds are just so low-bar. In short build a bridge and get over it. Reply Paul says December 23 2014 at 1103 pm Jeez lighten up man. You must be the loanly guy at the bar all alone. Reply Alan says December 18 2014 at 335 pm At the link there is note on the LACK of influence that Bettelheims book had on the piece. Obviously it can be argued that his work still did have some unconscious influence on the piece but Sondheim has never read Bettelheim and Lapine seems to have tried to consciously avoid letting any influence from Bettelheim find its way into the work. http//www.ovrtur.com/show/119941/trivia Reply Gabe says December 17 2014 at 152 pm well it sure looks good Reply jhs39 says December 17 2014 at 1250 pm I dont agree with the standby critical position that Rob Marshall over-edits his musical numbers in Chicago and Nine because he doesnt know what hes doing. If you watch the 1999 TV movie version of Annie which Rob Marshall choreographed and directed there is no over-editing at all and you are allowed to enjoy the choreography and dancing. But since Annie was a TV movie Marshall was allowed to use an entire cast with musical theater experience and talent. With Chicago and Nine he was stuck with a bunch of movie stars who frequently couldnt dance and could barely sing so he had little choice but to rapid edit the musical numbers rather than show how terrible the actual movie star dancing was. Into the Woods seems to have been much better cast than Chicago or Nine so surprise all of a sudden Rob Marshall isnt over-editing and allows the viewer to see the choreography again. Reply LOL says December 17 2014 at 1201 pm This film looks so crap. James Corden sucks. Reply Jade says December 17 2014 at 557 pm Not really. Its getting great reviews. Reply Stuart Yael Gordon says December 17 2014 at 814 am A better review than I expected. Ill be outside the movie theater at midnight on Christmas Day cosplayed as Jacks cow waiting in line in anticipation. What? Oh. Reply Jay says December 17 2014 at 904 am It was a better review than the movie deserved. The movie was painful. I wished for a ""Godzilla meets Bambi"" ending after the first 17 acts so that they would stop singing. The movie should come with a warning that it may cause PTSD. Reply Manuel says February 14 2015 at 941 pm Its a musical you moron cadavra says December 17 2014 at 1008 am How could you go to a Sondheim musical and not know thered be constant singing? Trip says December 17 2014 at 805 am Streep was terrible. everyone else was fantastic Reply Dennis J says December 17 2014 at 959 am Trip was probably on a trip when he saw it. Streep was wonderful. Perfect. Reply Manuel says February 14 2015 at 944 pm Hey Andrew Wallace Miller its a freaking MUSICAL... You know music singing... Why so many morons posting here? Andrew Wallace Miller says January 9 2015 at 155 pm I did not like the movie. Some scenes looked great but I do not really like a movies where almost every word is sung an I am a musician myself. I rate this movie a zero. Sorry just being honest. See All 40 Comments More Film News from Variety The Power of Content HBO Boss Talks True Detective Season 3 Deadwood Movie...

But Rob Marshall who directed a commercially successful example in Chicago and a misconceived dud in Nine hits a sweet spot between cinematic and theatrical with his captivating film adaptation of Into the Woods. This twisty fairy-tale mash-up shows an appreciation for the virtues of old-fashioned storytelling along with a welcome dash of subversive wit. It benefits from respect for the source material enticing production values and a populous gallery of sharp character portraits from a delightful cast. Its skeptical view of happy endings makes this release a tricky fit for the holiday family niche. But Disney should do nicely over the long haul with a classy film that will entertain youth audiences yet contains enough sly humor and narrative complexity to keep adults engaged. Arguably the most accessible though not the best of Stephen Sondheims musicals the 1987 Broadway hit is stuffed with themes that might easily have turned sugary in a screen treatment from this studio the parental urge to teach and protect; the childs propensity to learn more by experience and error; the marvels and menace of the world beyond home; the pain of loss; and the solace of community. But screenwriter James Lapine adapting his own book for the show has retained the balance of dark and light shaping a cohesive story of resilience and maturation out of multiple strands without leaning too hard on the sentiment. What was played for gallows humor onstage is often treated more earnestly here and the violence and tragedy are suggested more than shown. But theres enough Brothers Grimm in the tone to offset charges of Disney-fication. Marshall has mercifully avoided the wearisome trend of turning revisionist fairy tales into dour action fantasies set in digitized kingdoms out of a video game. (See Hansel amp; Gretel Witch Hunter Jack the Giant Slayer Red Riding Hood Snow White and the Huntsman ... no better yet dont.) CGI effects are used with intelligence and economy primarily where the storys magic dictates and the mix of soundstage sets with atmospheric locations is for the most part harmonious. A virtuoso opening sequence signals right off the bat that Marshall and Lapine know what theyre doing. In roughly 12 minutes of song and interspersed dialogue propelled by the musical motif ""I wish"" they introduce the major characters and identify the quests that will take them through the woods. Those key figures include a handful of classic fairy-tale recruits Cinderella (Anna Kendrick) toils in the scullery of her wicked stepmother (Christine Baranski) dreaming of attending the royal ball; feisty Little Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford) sets off to visit her granny; Jack (Daniel Huttlestone) is forced by his exasperated mother (Tracey Ullman) to take his cherished but milkless cow to the market to be sold. Read more Meryl Streep Anna Kendrick Share the Many Into the Woods Morals for Adult Moviegoers An original story converges with those timeworn tales concerning the village Baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt) unable to conceive a child. This is due to the curse of a Witch (Meryl Streep) whose beauty was destroyed when the Bakers father (Simon Russell Beale) raided her garden and stole her magic beans. But she gives the young couple a chance to reverse the curse with a series of tasks that set the journey in motion. That would be more than enough plot to sustain most movies. But this musicals raison detre is its exploration of the happily-ever-aftermath of wish fulfillment as the characters face the murky consequences of their moral compromises. The most frightening lesson is never piss off a Lady Giant (Frances de la Tour as sparingly glimpsed as the shark in Jaws). But there are other takeaways regarding blame and responsibility as the survivors confront an unknown side of themselves revealed during their time in the woods. Like the prior collaboration of Sondheim and Lapine Sunday in the Park With George this is a show whose distinct halves require a significant tonal shift that not every production navigates fluidly. Marshall does well enough even if the momentum falters after the buoyancy and cleverness of the first hour. But thats also partly due to the thematic clutter of diffuse material that has always tried to cover more ideas than the fanciful conceit can fully support. See more Making Into the Woods With Meryl Streep Emily Blunt (Photos) However those reservations in no way diminish the charm humor and poignancy of the overall experience. A key reward for the shows legions of fans will be the sophisticated treatment of the score which is orchestrated by Jonathan Tunick and conducted by Paul Gemignani both longtime Sondheim collaborators. The cuts are invariably smart ones made for pacing reasons -- with some lyrics reworked as dialogue and melodies repurposed as underscoring -- but the majority of the songs are represented. And unlike Tim Burtons film of Sweeney Todd which jettisoned the magnificent title ballad that sets the tone for the entire musical the sacrifices are justifiable. The most missed of them will likely be ""No More"" sung by the Baker and his father but its emotions are fully conveyed by Corden without slowing the late action. The actors incisive character work impresses across the board as does their musicality and unlike 2012s turgid Les Miserables they make it look effortless. Read more Behind the Screen Cinematographer Dion Beebe on Shooting Into the Woods Streep is quite wonderful delivering something far richer than her karaoke turn in the clunky Mamma Mia Her performances in the film adaptations of stage hits Doubt and August Osage County are among her less remarkable work of recent years. But she reinvents this role from scratch bringing powerful vocals mischievous comedic instincts bold physicality and raw feeling to the Witch. Her entrances and exits alone are priceless. She also aces some of the musicals best songs the furious waltz ""Last Midnight""; the beautiful cautionary anthem ""Children Will Listen""; and ""Stay With Me"" a wrenching plea to Rapunzel (MacKenzie Mauzy) the adopted daughter she has imprisoned in a tower ostensibly for the girls safety. Perhaps even more than on stage the muddled ways in which parents bestow their love are illustrated with touching compassion whether its the lengths the Baker and his wife will go to have a child or the fierce protectiveness of Jacks mother her affection often tempered with a cuff to the head. Even Cinderellas materialistic stepmother acts out of a crazed desire for the happiness of her daughters (Tammy Blanchard Lucy Punch) a pair of odious airheads. Read more Disney Musical Into the Woods Swoops Into Awards Season -- How Far Can It Go? In the central roles Corden and Blunt have disarming chemistry in both the comic and romantic sense. Hes sweet-natured guileless and burdened by the sins of his father while shes a shrewder type willing to stray from the path. Kendrick has never been more luminous and her big song ""On the Steps of the Palace"" is among the highlights performed as a moment of suspended time. Lapines smart touch of having her deliberately leave behind a shoe remains a gem. As the Prince who confesses ""I was raised to be charming not sincere"" Chris Pine is a hoot preening and posing with self-satisfaction and baffled that any maiden might resist him. Billy Magnussen is equally good as the Princes younger brother blinded by love for Rapunzel. Like campy escapees from some overheated bodice-ripper the Princes compete to outdo each other in melodramatic intensity -- and pecs -- in the hilarious ""Agony"" sung while prancing about a rocky cascade. The younger actors are excellent both nailing their signature songs. Huttlestone captures the dreamy wonder and excitement of ""Giants in the Sky"" while Crawford (star of Broadways recent Annie revival) is appealingly precocious. When she sings ""I Know Things Now"" you believe her. Read more New York Revival of Into the Woods to Coincide With Disney Release The one actor lost in the shuffle is Johnny Depp as the Wolf. He looks perfect in costumer Colleen Atwoods Tex Avery-inspired lupine zoot suit and salivates over his human dinner with gusto. But the role is an enjoyable cameo with little impact. And in an ugly CG sequence that jars stylistically with the rest of the movie Marshall botches the detour into the Wolfs stomach to liberate his prey. But elsewhere the film is ravishing. Cinematographer Dion Beebe paints the widescreen canvas in seductive shadow light and muted color keeping the camera movement sedate unless its agility is in response to the music. Dennis Gassners handsome production design evokes classic English fairy-tale illustration; the farmhouse where Jack and his mother live is just gorgeous. Atwoods costumes playfully mix time periods with an eye for character detail; her gown for the transformed Witch is a couture-drag knockout. And editor Wyatt Smith smoothly integrates dramatic scenes with songs charging ahead from one number to the next without seeming rushed.
