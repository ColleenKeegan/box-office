"Review Street Kings is all too by-the-book - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon Review Street Kings is all too by-the-bookStory Highlights ""Street Kings"" has been done better before says CNN.coms Tom Charity Movie stars Keanu Reeves as rogue cop who finds self in awkward position Film is adequate but no surprises for those whove seen ""Training Day"" Next Article in Entertainment >> By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- In ""Street Kings"" Keanu Reeves bad-boy cop Tom Ludlow may not play by the rules but the film sure does. Keanu Reeves second from left and Forest Whitaker are shifty cops in ""Street Kings."" The movie is textbook Cop Noir. Directed by David Ayer who wrote ""Training Day"" and directed ""Harsh Times"" from a script that originated with ""L.A. Confidential"" novelist James Ellroy its a story both men have told before and will doubtless return to again. Too bad that story -- the one about the constant struggle with an impure world betrayal disillusionment retribution all that jazz -- isnt told with much originality this time around. As Ludlow a detective with a special LAPD vice squad Reeves shoots first and asks questions much much later. In his field the bad guys are easy to spot and if Tom has to get his hands dirty well then hell be careful to wipe away the residue before he calls it in. He works from the gut. We have Ludlows number from the beginning He wakes up vomits cleans his gun and knocks back a couple of miniature bottles of vodka. Then he crashes a kidnappers den and puts down four gangsters before they know whats hit them. ""Dont worry"" he tells the distraught little girls caged up in the back. ""Im a cop."" Its probably superfluous to add that hes still nursing a grievous hangover from the wife who died in flagrante with a person unknown two or three years ago. Its also probably superfluous to mention that Internal Affairs (headed by Hugh Laurie) is beginning to sniff around Ludlows unit. In particular IA is talking to his ex-partner Washington (Terry Crews) a revelation that sends Ludlow reaching for his baseball bat. Before he can put Washington straight though his old pal is gunned down before his eyes by a couple of punks. Can Ludlow cover up his own potentially incriminating presence at the scene and still track down the cop killers? Hell yes even if he has to alienate everyone in the department before hes through. Reeves doesnt do much ""acting"" as such but he doesnt need to His performance is clean and spare in synch with Ayers clipped economy and he has a doleful quality that goes some way to redeem a nasty and wretchedly naive character. Alcoholism doesnt appear to have thrown off Ludlows aim any but it must have dulled his reasoning. A broody intuitive detective should be able to piece together this boilerplate mystery without too much head-scratching but Ludlow never stops to look even two steps ahead. (I guess hes not a James Ellroy fan.) But what he lacks in insight he makes up for in sheer determination not to say blood-lust. In a neat touch when its time to cool off his public profile for a spell the rogue cop is transferred to a desk in the complaints department -- surely his idea of purgatory and obviously an utterly pointless occupation. Forest Whitaker boosts the energy level as Ludlows paternalistic mentor boss and No. 1 fan ""Youre the tip of the spear"" he tells him. ""Who else is going to hold back the animals?"" Violent and cynical and a shade or two overdetermined ""Street Kings"" ably demonstrates the pitfalls embedded in the pragmatics of ""a necessary evil"" or anyone who sets himself up as a law unto himself but ultimately it cant conceive of a better alternative. After all the rest is politics a game that even the most hard-boiled anti-hero would never lower himself to enter. And besides hes seen it before. ""Street Kings"" is rated R and runs 107 minutes.

Merrick Morton/Fox Searchlight Pictures hide caption toggle caption Merrick Morton/Fox Searchlight Pictures Tom Ludlow (Keanu Reeves) has an angry itchy trigger finger in Street Kings. Merrick Morton/Fox Searchlight Pictures Director David AyerGenre ActionRunning Time 109 minutes Watch a Clip Prior to seeing Street Kings Id have said that writers James Ellroy (L.A. Confidential) and David Ayer (Training Day) were precisely the folks youd want behind the scenes on a corrupt-cops thriller. Now Im not so sure. Separately idiosyncratic the two have come up with a joint project (Ayer directing an Ellroy story) that mostly repackages genre cliches with an added dollop of violence. Keanu Reeves is the films Charles Bronson-esque lead a theoretically principled cop caught between boss Forest Whitaker and Internal Affairs detective Hugh Laurie as a scandal looms; hell go to any lengths to expose department corruption Reeves character will but apparently he sees no contradiction in faking crime scenes and coercing sources as hes doing it. Bodies start piling up (rappers Common and The Game among them) as do stereotypes as the film wends its way to a conclusion thats at once predictable and incoherent. Getting there would be more fun -- Reeves seems to down a single-shot bottle of vodka every time he gets behind the wheel -- if the plot didnt have holes through which he could drive whole fleets of squad cars.

James Ellroys mastery of the crime genre is by now indisputable. Kurt Wimmer is the creative force behind sci-fi underachiever Equilibrium. When they met it was... mediocre.Numerous well- worn Ellroy themes crop up as Keanu Reeves morally ambiguous cop investigates the murder of his treacherous former partner presided over by Forest Whitakers paternalistic but shadowy captain. Director Ayers stated aim was a police procedural free of the usual stereotypes but every aspect of this production is riddled with the worst kinds of cliche. For British viewers the sight of Hugh Laurie cursing a blue streak still has a certain undeniable charm. And as the plot contrivances pile up and the bodycount spirals the film threatens to tip into outright pastiche transforming a commonplace thriller into a low rent camp classic. But sadly this never happens - Ayers grip on his abysmal material is too sure and what could have been endearingly daft remains merely forgettable.

The plot has a departed style ""lets shoot everyone"" theme but regardless as a hard boiled cop keanu delivers - looking just the right side of bloated and downtrodden. I thought the movie was pretty much a chracter piece for keanu with everyone else as peripherals to the story - and it focuses on his flawed attempt at redemption. I thought there were some great performances and good dialogue - as you would expect from ellroy - but as with most cop/action movies cliche was inevitable.

Comments Street Kings Another roid-raging dirty cop drama from David Ayer who scripted Training Day (2001) and Dark Blue (2002) before making his directorial debut with the overlooked Harsh Times (2005). This time the embittered blue knight is a widowed LAPD detective (a beefy Keanu Reeves) whos being fingered by a department whistle-blower and has the bad luck to be in a convenience store with him when the guy is pumped full of lead by drug dealers. The script is by Jamie Moss James Ellroy (L.A. Confidential) and Kurt Wimmer (Ultraviolet) but it preserves the peculiar machismo of Ayers earlier projects the alpha male dominates not only because hes the most powerful but because hes the most jaded.

Street Kings (R) Fox Searchlight (109 min.) Directed by David Ayer. With Keanu Reeves Forest Whitaker Hugh Laurie. Now playing in New Jersey. TWO AND A HALF STARS An alcoholic wakes up throws up gets his police badge and service revolver and goes off to work. Lowlifes kidnap little girls off the street then keep them like dogs in a chicken-wire cage with a dirty mattress for a floor. Everyone -- everyone -- is dirty racist violent angry. Welcome to Ellroys L.A. James Ellroy has been writing fiction for over 25 years now and although his last few books have been grimy historical novels -- Dealey-Plaza-as-crime-scene -- hell always be known for his hopped-up hard-boiled mysteries adrenaline-pumped period pieces like ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""The Black Dahlia."" Hollywood adaptations got the first one mostly right and badly screwed up the second. But that doesnt mean the studios and the man dont keep trying. ""Street Kings"" is the latest an original story and screenplay by Ellroy later rewritten by someone else (and then for good measure rewritten again by still another stranger.) And it has a lot of the strengths and weaknesses of earlier adaptations. There are lines of dialogue that -- even in this day -- still shock with their inventive profanity and goading offensiveness. There is the bracing melodrama of police work -- dirty cops and snitches planted pieces and Internal Affairs. Theres the theme -- the one constant through all the books -- of a man trying to forget his own pain by burying himself in others. That all comes from Ellroy. Then there are actors who are too young or too pretty for their characters. There are the female characters who exist only to bind up the heros wounds or the desperately real issues (alcoholism racism) used merely as time-saving plot devices. And then theres the plot itself losing its way in the second act and completely gone by the third. And that all comes from Hollywood. Keanu Reeves for example is a sincere young actor and -- at 43 -- hes finally begun to lose some of his surfer-dude cadences. But as hard as he tries the part of a hair-trigger drunken burn-out remains just out of reach. (Kurt Russell came far closer in another Ellroy adaptation the botched but far more interesting ""Dark Blue"" -- which not incidentally this films director did a rewrite on.). As his commanding officer Forest Whitaker is back to overacting; as a scared snitch Cedric the Entertainer has nothing to do but sputter and dress like Rerun. And while hes fine as a police investigator its a mistake to introduce Hugh Laurie in a hospital; at the screening I went to the sudden reminder of ""House"" had people giggling. Director David Ayer who also previously wrote ""Training Day"" (and made the over-the-top ""Harsh Times"") is good with brutal action -- an important skill as this movie is crammed with it. Hes a little too fond of shots of the blood-red sun setting behind the L.A. skyline perhaps but he pays attention to framing and editing and the movie moves. Still in the end its only a movie. It doesnt have the sweaty smell of corruption that Ellroys best books have the sense that were all damned from the start and the one chance we have at redemption is finally forcefully acknowledging how deep the dirt in us goes. He writes Calvinist screeds against sin; filmmakers turn them into shoot-em-up thrillers. But thats the difference between Ellroys L.A. -- and the studios Hollywood. Rating note The film contains nonstop profanity racial slurs gory violence and substance abuse. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

But watch him in Street Kings a serviceable policier in the Dirty Harry mould and suddenly a certain resemblance clicks same granite face same dispassionate trigger finger. And then some.As LAPD Det. Tom Ludlow Reeves gives Clints soiled cop a run for his magnum. Call him Very Dirty Harry - this is one violent film - but its more homage than rip-off by Reeves director David Ayer (Harsh Times) and author/screenwriter James Ellroy. (L.A. Confidential).Ludlow rises bleary-eyed from bed checks his gun and promptly throws up the remains of the vodka he swigs from his stash of mini bottles. Hes ready for another day of fighting the ""animals"" as his supportive superior Capt. Jack Wander (Forest Whitaker) calls the good citizens of Los Angeles. Ludlow is ""the last of the ghetto gunfighters"" sneers another police boss Internal Affairs Capt. James Biggs (Hugh Laurie). Biggs doesnt like Ludlows methods even though they get results.You could say Ludlow shoots first and ask questions later - except no ones left alive to answer any queries. He shows this in the opening reel with a heroic solo raid on a pedophile ring leaving planted evidence on a pile of bodies.""Were the police"" Ludlow reasons. ""We can do whatever the hell we want."" He has a tragic personal back-story that explains why he chooses expediency over ethics.Ludlow has Capt. Wander watching his back plus a loyal girlfriend (Martha Higareda) whose nursing skills are a plus when digging bullets out of his hide. Ludlow also has an admirer of sorts in his new cop partner (Chris Evans). Then something happens to force a radical reappraisal of loyalties.The memory touchstones abound in Street Kings. When its not paying homage to Dirty Harry its doffing the hat to Serpico and other 1970s cops-and-robbers dramas - an era when you left movie theatres feeling like you wanted either a stiff Scotch or a razor blade.But Ayer knows what hes doing although he does let the film run a tad long at close to two hours and crowds it with characters. Still the movie belongs to Reeves who at 43 is finally starting to look like an adult with greater heft all round. He does Clint proud.

Load an automatic weapon have a light vomit and start looking for people to shoot. Its how I start my day and it works pretty well for Keanu Reeves as an LA cop in ""Street Kings"" a wet red chunk of pulp that knows what it is and doesnt care. In the hierarchy of the most brain-teasing crime puzzles ever devised by James Ellroy who co-wrote the script this one ranks somewhere below circle-a-word; your average coma patient or bath sponge will have figured out whos behind the murder as soon as it happens. Thus Reeves is required to seem like the dumbest guy in the room. You could say he was born to play this role. Still at a Coney Island shooting gallery you know who did it dont you? Does that make it any less fun? Like director David Ayers previous movies (he wrote ""Training Day"") ""Street Kings"" is about the joy of badass coppery. This would include drinking both on the job and while driving inappropriate community-outreach (Reeves Tom Ludlow addresses Korean folks as ""zipperhead dog-munching dinks"") and Toms tendency to be discovered in rooms with lots of unmoving bodies containing his bullets. To his boss (Forest Whitaker) Tom complains ""I got shot"" and the Whitaker character is embarrassed at this outburst of whining ""Yeah but you OK?"" Friends call Tom ""LAs deadliest white boy"" and in the LAPD they stitch that on your uniform and give you a raise. Tom gets caught up in police corruption while trying to solve the bullet-aided demise of his ex-partner. His fellow cops promise to help make any potential charges go away but who would trust these guys? Jay Mohr wears a mustache that itself looks like it served hard time for felonious bad taste an inspector from Internal Affairs (Hugh Laurie of ""House"") tries to trick Tom and the officer assigned to investigate the murder that may or may not implicate Tom (Chris Evans of ""Fantastic Four"") is called ""Disco."" Though we are informed that Tom is ""a damn fine cop. He bleeds blue"" - please screenwriters can we just once have a cop who bleeds some other color? Harvest orange maybe or a nice celadon? - Im still not buying Keanu Reeves as a tough guy. His jerky movements are relatively under control here but he still makes me wonder if hes trying to work out a neck cramp. When he should be a rock of menace like Charles Bronson he instead calls to mind a bobblehead doll. Its more fun watching Forest Whitaker - lately a cowering simp in ""Vantage Point"" and ""The Great Debaters"" - cut loose with lines like ""You want to talk? Lets talk about my foot up youre a - -"" Its almost as if these gentlemen are enjoying the hostility. After wandering into a den full of explosively armed drug dealers watching CNBC blowing away a dozen or so heavy villains and nearly burying himself in a shallow grave Tom has an answer for every situation - except a disapproving girlfriend who wants to know ""Why cant you have a normal life like everyone else?"" on the job and while driving inappropriate community outreach (Reeves Tom Ludlow addresses Korean folks as ""zipperhead dog-munching dinks"") and Toms tendency to be discovered in rooms with lots of unmoving bodies containing his bullets.

Joe Neumaier Wednesday June 4 2008 340 PM STREET KINGS. Action drama about an honest cop uncovering widespread corruption. With Keanu Reeves Forest Whitaker Hugh Laurie. Director David Ayer (147). R Violence language. At area theaters.After its cliched first scene - a solo LAPD officer battling a well-armed gang of thugs - ""Street Kings"" becomes an enjoyably tough blood-splattered action drama that revolves around the one good cop at its center.That cop Ludlow (Keanu Reeves) is a hero thanks to the shoot-em-up that opens the movie and his bravery has boosted his captain (Forest Whitaker) closer to chief. But a snaky internal affairs officer (Hugh Laurie) is sniffing around sensing somethings not right. In fact a lot isnt right as Ludlow discovers when he hunts down the gunmen who killed his former partner Washington (Terry Crews). But hes not just seeking revenge for a fallen comrade Ludlows a loose cannon who thought Washington was falsely accusing him of being on the take. Suspected of being involved in Washingtons death Ludlow tries to clear himself but finds new puzzles at every turn. ""Street Kings"" comes from the mind of co-screenwriter James Ellroy the crime novelist whose ""L.A. Confidential"" took an equally twisty look at brother cops fighting like Cain and Abel. ""Kings"" isnt as great as that movie - few police procedurals are - but it has a similarly seething energy. The director David Ayer wrote ""Training Day"" - another atmospheric winner - and here he crafts several set pieces filled with a gripping sense of danger. A lot of that danger comes courtesy of the sly supporting cast. ""House"" star Laurie fills even straightforward conversations with little insults and Jay Mohr John Corbett and Amaury Nolasco all give feisty turns as members of Ludlows squad. Whitaker uses his hulking mix of friendliness and intimidation to great effect while Chris Evans as an analyst hungry to get out from behind his desk makes the most of his sidekick status. Naomie Harris and rapper The Game stand out in minor roles. But its Reeves who anchors the film with the squinty assurance of an actor whos been around 20 years and has done his time giving his Valley Boy delivery a raspy exhausted quality. Reeves knows action thrillers and how to make that Zen vagueness of his serve the greater good. ""Street Kings"" is an arresting ride. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Tom Ludlow (Keanu Reeves) fresh from a beating at the hands of two Korean hoods bursts into their lair shoots everyone in cold blood and puts a gun in a corpses hand for his ""they fired first"" alibi. Ludlow casually feeds the lie to his complicit fellow police and gets a heros tribute in the press. The scene sets the tone for this grimly violent film and the murk of official corruption its characters swim through. Our screen surrogate an amoral remorseless killer is the best vice cop in Los Angeles. ""Street Kings"" gives us a scuzzy world where the distinction between perps and lawmen is dim at best. Co-scripted by brutalist crime writer James Ellroy and directed by David Ayer who wrote the depraved-cop drama ""Training Day"" the film wears its cynicism on its blood-soaked sleeve. Everyone in the large cast is presented as a possible bad guy and almost everyone is one to some degree. Ludlow follows the grand tradition of loose-cannon policemen. He starts his day with a puke and cleanses his palate with a vodka mouthwash. Living on the edge since his wife died in another mans bed hes the animal the force turns loose to hold back the animals. Ludlow despises his do-gooder ex-partner suspecting that hes about to rat him out for planting evidence. When the man ends up as a slippery floor hazard following a convenience store shootout Ludlow is a prime suspect caught between his manipulative mentor LAPD vice Capt. Jack Wander (Forest Whitaker) and aggressive Internal Affairs Capt. James Biggs (Hugh Laurie). Demoted to paper-shuffling duty in the headquarters complaint desk Ludlow spends his free hours digging into his old partners death uncovering a labyrinthine trail of wrongdoing that reaches the heart of the department. Its a good role for the poker- faced Reeves; his noncommittal expression keeps us guessing about his every move. ""Street Kings"" wobbles increasingly as it runs along beginning well growing so-so and culminating in a preposterous heres-what-it-all-means confession by the main villain. Still the film has technical polish and inventive casting. Rappers Common and the Game make strong impressions as mysterious menaces Cedric the Entertainer scores as a nervous drug dealer and Laurie owns every scene. STREET KINGS  out of 4 stars Rating R for strong violence and pervasive language. Ayer understands that conviction velocity and adrenaline count for more than intellect in stories such as this. He doesnt develop a distinctive action aesthetic like William Friedkin or Sam Peckinpah but hes proficient at making us jump with jittery whiplash editing. He regularly steers his characters into bombastic gun battles and propulsive foot chases through ratty hoods that the Los Angeles Tourist Authority would rather keep under wraps. With all those bullet holes punching through the sets -- and the actors -- whos going to quibble about gaps in the plot?

Street Kings (R) 1/2 | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Street Kings (R) 1/2 Filmmaker David Ayer continues painting L.A.s finest as a gang of trigger-happy gunslingers who never hesitate to break the law. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez Miami Herald Filmmaker David Ayer appears to have made it his lifes mission to ensure that the world knows that when it comes to corruption the Los Angeles Police Department ranks somewhere between the Miami International Airport and a Mexican prison. In Street Kings Ayer continues on the path he started with Training Day (which he wrote) and Harsh Times (which he directed) painting L.A.s finest as a gang of trigger-happy gunslingers who never hesitate to break the law -- and sometimes go far beyond it -- in order to carry out what they consider to be their duty. Based on a story by James Ellroy (who explored the roots of L.A. corruption in the now-classic L.A. Confidential) Street Kings stars Keanu Reeves as Tom Ludlow a veteran detective who picked up a drinking habit after the death of his wife. Essentially a grim and unfunny version of Mel Gibsons Sgt. Martin Riggs from Lethal Weapon Ludlow is also a loose cannon used to shooting first and asking questions later. Fortunately he has a sympathetic soul in his commanding officer (Forest Whitaker) who routinely covers up Ludlows transgressions in order to keep the ace cop on the streets. Then Ludlow starts to suspect his former partner (Terry Crews) has started snitching to Internal Affairs about his less-than-lawful methods. The plot of Street Kings centers on Ludlows gradual redemption which involves lots of dynamic action sequences and feverish shootouts. The picture may feel more than a little familiar but Ayer knows how to cook up intense setpieces and Reeves keeps getting better at the weary hero role he continually gravitates toward. If nothing else Street Kings is perfectly passable filler to help pass the time while we wait for the return of The Shield.

In ""Street Kings"" a new but lesser police thriller starring Keanu Reeves and Forest Whitaker the Administrative Vice detectives of the L.A.P.D. annex a bit of turf here plant some evidence there and act with just the right amount of impunity to have eluded Internal Affairs. Because the bad guys are truly venal the cops dark arts are self-justified. ""Street Kings"" begins with Detective Tom Ludlows sour routine a hurl into the porcelain bowl a loading of his firearm. He revs his modern-day muscle car through the streets of Los Angeles to a liquor store where he buys tiny airline-size bottles of vodka to ease a long-standing grief the death of his wife. Like much here the truth of her demise defies sentiment. A meeting in a parking lot with a pair of Korean thugs leaves Ludlow curled on the pavement. (His race-baiting dialogue sounds like scorching outtakes from ""Crash."") They steal his ride and the hulking machine gun he tried to sell them. Its all part of a plan. The men have kidnapped and enslaved twin sisters. Ludlows assault on their flophouse compound is pure gunslinging by way of action master John Woo. As the dust settles and the blood dries some things are made clear. Ludlows cohort in Ad Vice think hes too much the solo act. One-time partner Detective Terrence Washington (Terry Crews) believes Ludlow has morphed into a racist vigilante. But Capt. Jack Wander (Whitaker) loves him all the more. ""You went toe to toe with evil and won"" he tells his loosest cannon. Then Detective Washington is shot down and Ludlow becomes a suspect. Trying to clear his name and find two gang-banging killers he and the film plunge further into the muck. Evidence will be tampered with. Bodies will show up in shallow graves. Trust will be in short supply. Chris Evans plays Diskant a more- decent-than-not detective who follows Ludlow into the hazy precincts of corruption. Jay Mohr John Corbett and Amaury Nolasco play his fellow officers who may or may not have his back. Hip-hop artists Common and the Game make pivotal appearances. Cedric the Entertainer cruises up in an orange El Dorado. Hugh Laurie is Internal Affairs Capt. Biggs. His first come-on to Ludlow takes place in a hospital with a wink at the actors TV character on ""House."" The rest of his impromptu appearances carry a heftier weight. ""Street Kings"" has hints of ""Training Day"" and the subtle aroma of ""L.A. Confidential"" two movies concerned with the moral ambiguity and compromised honor of L.A.s finest. Director David Ayer wrote the former (as well as police dramas ""Dark Blue"" and ""S.W.A.T.""); co-writer James Ellroy penned the novel on which the latter was so beautifully based. This thriller is more diffuse than either. We begin disoriented. With latter- day noirs this ethical vertigo is the point. Yet the payoffs are skimpy. Over the years Reeves has been something of a conundrum. He has a warm inviting makeup that nonetheless resists emotional reads. His flatness works well for some characters (sanctified Neo boneheaded Ted). It nearly works here Ludlow is as dulled by grief as he is driven by it. But his depth goes unrevealed. Whitaker is Reeves counter. He seems to plumb a characters core within seconds onscreen. The scenes between mentor and student Whitakers monarch and Reeves errant knight begin to capture the dramatic ambitions of the tale. They come on strong -- but come too late.

"Kings cops out video-game style - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsReal EstateLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review Kings cops out video-game style From left Keanu Reeves Jay Mohr Amaury Nolasco John Corbett and Forest Whitaker in ""Street Kings."" (FOX SEARCHLIGHT) Email|Print|Single Page| Text size - + By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / April 11 2008 In ""Street Kings"" a hard-boiled Keanu Reeves spends a few intense days trying to find the men who framed him for his ex-police partners murder. In every sense the movie is like a Rockstar Games title The Los Angeles it has reconstructed is endless and complex but the action is mindless - shoot kill win. Reeves meanwhile has the kind of semi-alive pixilated face that turns up in Grand Theft Auto or Midnight Club.Reeves is playing Tom Ludlow a widowed vice cop. His murdered ex-partner (Terry Crews) snitched to Internal Affairs about some of Toms past misdeeds. Tom is furious. When some cholos shoot the partner dead Toms culpability seems plausible to department higher-ups including an annoying police captain (Hugh Laurie) and Toms power-hungry boss (Forest Whitaker) who puts him in a uniform and gives him a desk job fielding complaints until the case blows over. But Toms hot to catch the killers and the movie works too hard to build a narrative excuse for all the shootouts and dead Asians and rap stars on the floor when theyre over. Not to mention all the actors - Chris Evans Laurie Cedric the Entertainer Naomie Harris Jay Mohr Common - who go underused. Thats OK since by the end of the film Whitaker has done enough acting for all of them.""Street Kings"" is nonsense and yet the crooked racialized world underneath the soulless mayhem is pretty fascinating. Ten minutes in before Reevess character busts two Korean-Americans looking to buy guns he zings them with slurs - and not as part of some undercover shtick either. The racism is a weapon. Tom wouldnt say hes a racist. Some of his best friends are black. His nurse-girlfriend is Hispanic. But in this movie race is all anybody sees when they look at anybody else.Like a lot of movies about the LAPD this one is a grim and vulgar hall of mirrors. Having seen ""Training Day"" with a gonzo Denzel Washington and ""Harsh Times"" with a gonzo Christian Bale Im familiar with what the director and co-writer David Ayer thinks about Los Angeles law enforcement. A cop is the boogeyman - a menace to society a menace to himself.In Ayers movies the police arent purely bad because there is no bad by virtue of there being no appreciable good. Maybe this seems extra-rich in ""Street Kings"" thanks to whatever contributions James Ellroy made to the movies script Corruption is the way of this world. But Ayer doesnt use his cynicism to build a consistent complete movie. Hes not an explorative director. Hes a guy.This is a movie that likes its cliches cheap melodrama and guns. Ayer appears to like the thrill of violence more than its philosophical underpinnings so the movie is caught between the silly and the profound. When Tom asks ""What happened to putting the bad guys in jail"" your heart goes out to him. Hes still thinking like a cop not like an avatar in a video game.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/ movies/blog.

(AP Photo/Fox Searchlight Pictures Merrick Morton)  NO SALES  Photo Merrick Morton Cop skirts thin blue line in Street Kings 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Street Kings Crime thriller. Starring Keanu Reeves and Forest Whitaker. Directed by David Ayer. (R. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Theres a lot to appreciate in ""Street Kings"" a tight propulsive action thriller but theres one thing to marvel at and thats James Ellroys command of story. The best-selling crime novelist co-wrote the movies screenplay but he wrote the story all by himself and it really is a thing of beauty. Its satisfying and consistently surprising and yet those surprises are always appropriate and right and the directions Ellroy chooses are invariably better and wiser than anything anybody might have guessed. To give an example of the kind of thing Ellroy does he will introduce a plot element that you think will take the whole movie to resolve - and then hell resolve it in some unexpected way in the very next scene. Its as if hes watching the movie too and knows what the audience wants (so he provides it immediately) and what the audience expects (so he does the opposite). Its safe to say that there isnt a major scene in ""Street Kings"" in which Ellroy doesnt figure out a way to do something that breaks the pattern. Keanu Reeves is at the center of the movie playing a tough cop on a hair trigger and while Reeves has never seemed the hair-trigger type he finds a way to make the role work for him. It helps that at 43 he has lost his doe-eyed innocent look. Reeves helps himself further by not trying to be a hard case but rather by playing the detective as reserved and contained. After a while this combination of a reserved exterior and violent behavior conveys the idea of a guy whos dangerous because hes reserved; hes so bottled up hes about to explode. The opening sequence throws us right into this mans world. He lives alone. He wakes up and immediately throws up - a wordless commentary on his life. He buys little bottles of vodka the kind found in hotel mini-bars and downs them when hes driving. Yet when hes thrown into a situation of mortal danger he suddenly becomes the consummate professional. Thats when he comes alive. Tom (Reeves) is the star of an elite detective unit a band of brothers headed by a captain played by Forest Whitaker. Reeves successful performance in ""Street Kings"" is a fairly straightforward affair the product of adopting a simple strategy and sticking to it. Whitakers performance is more complicated the result of meticulous planning combined with brilliant in-the-moment inspiration. The captain is a big brother and a lovable fellow a fundamentally simple person but one who has seen so much of the dark side that he really cant be simple anymore. The action of ""Street Kings"" involves Tom going around to the various armpits of Los Angeles investigating the murder of a fellow officer - even as Internal Affairs in the person of a sly captain (Hugh Laurie) suspects that maybe Tom himself might have been behind the cops death. As such the story has echoes of the old Hitchcock number in which a wrongly accused man looks for the real culprits though with Ellroy telling the story the plot has so many bells and whistles that youd never recognize it. David Ayer who directed is best known as a screenwriter (""Training Day"") but he had no hand in the screenplay. In ""Street Kings"" he shows he can present urban squalor with the best of them but more important than that he films the action in a refreshingly unflashy way standing back so we can see it letting the moments of conflict speak for themselves without shaking the camera to suggest panic. He doesnt try to announce himself as a director. He just tells the story briskly and economically. He keeps it moving and packs a lot into 107 minutes. A more ostentatious director would have found a way to stretch things to two hours minimum. Ayer just serves the story and the audience. At the screening I attended the crowd got a big kick out of famous faces turning up in featured roles. Of particular note is Cedric the Entertainer who makes a case for himself in a dramatic role as a small-time drug dealer. -- Advisory Strong violence and adult language.

Well OK maybe not the gun. And maybe not the puking. And maybe not the liquor-store detour on the way to work to grab a fistful of vodka bottles the kind they give you on planes. From the opening minutes of the hard-boiled rogue-cops drama Street Kings its pretty clear that Tom Ludlow (Keanu Reeves) is one messed-up dude. A Los Angeles vice detective with a stellar record of big-time busts and bravery (or craziness) this guy long ago forgot how to read the Miranda. Ludlow is more the shoot-first/plant-evidence-later kind of cop. And his boss Capt. Jack Wander (Forest Whitaker) loves him. Roiling with racial and ethnic slurs (Asians and blacks get the brunt of it but nobodys spared) and alive with the crazy-quilt cacophony that is L.A. - the barrios Korea Town Watts the dusty hilltops the scuzzy mini-malls - Street Kings comes by way of mystery scribe James Ellroy (story and screenplay) and David Ayer the Training Day writer taking his second stab at directing. (His first Harsh Times also set in L.A. with Christian Bale as a self-destructive Army vet is well worth checking out.) Street Kings like Ellroys and Ayers aforementioned credits delves into the inner workings of the L.A.P.D. - the maverick detectives the culture of racism and corruption the notion of loyalty over honesty. Its a twisted in-joke that at the funeral of a fallen officer the chief of police is played by Daryl Gates - the citys real ex-police commissioner who long reigned over a notoriously unscrupulous department. Street Kings is a good compelling violent picture but it has its flaws not the least of which is the casting of Reeves and Whitaker. These guys are actors yes and theyre up for the job - and its never hard to watch them - but theyre gentle souls too you can see it in their eyes. The profane possessed take-no-prisoners attitudes theyre required to take to inhabit dont come easy for either man. Theres also a familiar template at the heart of Street Kings - familiar to anyone whos read Ellroys L.A. Confidential or seen Curtis Hansons rippingingly good film version. And Hugh Laurie in a key supporting role as an Internal Affairs officer on Ludlows and Wanders case seems stuck in his TV medico House shtick; it was probably a bad idea to have Lauries first scene set in a hospital snapping wise to a bed-bound patient. But much of the casting is dead-on from Cedric the Entertainer as a street dealer to Jay Mohr as a slimy cop and Chris Evans as an earnest rookie who saddles up with Reeves Ludlow for an ill-fated ride. Street Kings  (out of four stars) Directed by David Ayer. With Keanu Reeves Forest Whitaker Chris Evans Hugh Laurie Cedric the Entertainer Martha Higareda and Jay Mohr.

"Keanu Reeves in Street Kings. Slate Sign In Sign Up Keanu Reeves in Street Kings. Keanu Reeves in Street Kings. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 10 2008 1218 PM Whoa Keanu Reeves as a Dirty Harry-style cop in Street Kings. By Dana Stevens Forest Whitaker and Keanu Reeves in Street Kings The press bio of David Ayer who wrote Training Day and directed the new Street Kings (Fox Searchlight) from a story by James Ellroy trumpets Ayers gritty coming-of-age experience in Los Angeles with the director himself extolling his ""organic understanding of whats happening on the streets of L.A. on any given day."" But however comfortable he may be chillaxin in South Central Ayers scripts read like the work of a latchkey kid left home with a battered VHS tape of To Live and Die in L.A. In that William Friedkin classic a pair of cops one a moral blank slate the other a gonzo narcissist use their state-sanctioned power to cross far far over the thin blue line. Its a structure that Ayer has reproduced intact in every one of his films so far including Dark Blue which he wrote with Ellroy and Harsh Times his 2006 self-financed directorial debut. To make an Ayer film you place a ruthless but charismatic older cop in the drivers seat of a Crown Victoria plonk down an Oedipally challenged rookie by his side fill the glove box with miniature bottles of vodka speed to the ghetto and see what happens. But what if the cop in that drivers seat isnt Denzel Washington or Kurt Russell but the waxen perpetually boyish Keanu Reeves? Though hes given a younger sidekick (Chris Evans) for a brief stretch later in the movie Reeves Tom Ludlow must in essence contain both sides of the Training Day dialectic within himself. Hes both the macho trigger-happy hothead and the sensitive soul sworn to root out corruption in his own unit. Early on Toms boss police captain Jack Wander (Forest Whitaker) tips him off that his former partner Washington (Terry Crews) has been snitching to Internal Affairs about Toms disregard for search warrants and Miranda rights not to mention his penchant for smoking bad guys before bothering to discern whether they pose an imminent threat. Advertisement In a wildly improbable convenience-store holdup Washington the whistle-blower is killed by masked thugs just as Tom is about to confront him. Toms fellow cops assuming that he arranged the hit close ranks to protect him from the suspicions of Internal Affairs investigator Capt. Biggs (Hugh Laurie). But Toms idealistic side--his inner Ethan Hawke if you will--cant allow Washingtons murder to go unsolved. His tenacity will lead him into the tangled bowels of the L.A. drug world where hell interrogate one suspect (played by rapper The Game) with telephone-book blows to the head trap another in a loop of razor wire and use an easygoing junkie named Scribble (Cedric the Entertainer) as a human shield. By the time Ludlow uncovers the real source of the moral rot in his department (a perpetrator so obvious that Scooby and Shaggy would have nailed it by the first commercial) the audience can no longer make any meaningful distinction between this gleefully brutal enforcer and the street scum hes resolved to eliminate. ""All of us are scum"" would be a dishearteningly nihilistic message but its never clear what Ayer is trying to say. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. A closing shot in which Ludlow on a balcony high above the city surveys the smoggy bowl of Los Angeles harks back to a line spoken by Whitakers character earlier in the movie. Without Ludlows brand of maverick policing he asks ""Wholl hold back the animals?"" So which is it Has Ludlow lost our sympathy by sinking to the level of ""the animals"" or are we the policed just too craven to admit that we depend upon that brutality for our protection? Theres something cynical about Ayers attempt to preserve Ludlow as a hero after scene upon scene meant to show with heavy irony how lawlessly he enforced the law. You cant lionize your Dirty Harry vigilante and expose his hypocrisy too. Correction April 10 2008 The article originally misspelled the name of director David Ayer.

Who knows in real life maybe hes a deep thinker. Hosts salons devoted to Proust. Something. On film however hes mostly known - with the exception of playing Neo in The Matrix - as a dude who says such things as ""Whoa"" a lot and says them with such conviction its as if hes not really acting. With Street Kings Reeves has hit upon a stroke of genius Choose a project thats even dumber than our perception of him. He cant help but look good by comparison. Reeves stars as Tom Ludlow a drunken Los Angeles cop who deals with the death of his wife in part by getting tanked and killing bad guys - the cases too messy and convoluted to wait for the scales of justice to sort out. File under A man who has nothing left to lose. If youve ever seen an episode of The Shield on FX which is far superior you know the drill. But Ludlow runs into some serious trouble even for him. His former partner (Terry Crews) doesnt like Ludlows methods and is known to be talking to internal affairs. Is he ratting out Ludlow? Or his captain Jack Wander (Forest Whitaker)? Or is something else going on? Internal affairs is represented by Capt. James Biggs (Hugh Laurie) who has a history with Wander. We know this because of the way they scream threats at each other. Nice shorthand. Soon Ludlow is suspected in the murder of a cop but Wander is taking care of him. Ludlow though has a sense of justice and doesnt want any favors. So he enlists the help of the investigating officer Paul Diskant (Chris Evans) to find out who the real killers are even if it makes things look bad for him. Its not as simple as all that (if thats even simple). There are twists and turns in the plot some easy to spot some not worth looking for and eventually it all turns quite sordid. There arent a lot of good guys and almost no one to root for. Presumably we could hang our hat on Ludlow but hes so damaged he seems like a bad bet. Its all meant to be tough dark gritty. Certainly the action scenes pack a high-powered wallop. But really Street Kings is just kind of silly - there are bad guys and worse guys. Last guy standing with a gun in his hand wins. The systems so corrupt no one will notice the mess. James Ellroy wrote the script; he also wrote the novel on which L.A. Confidential was based. If youre hoping for a similar intelligence youre out of luck. Its nice to see Laurie outside the hospital environs of House (though when we first see his character its in an emergency room). But here he remains a crusty sort only he gets to use profanity. Whitaker screams a lot. Reeves broods. And Street Kings leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. But at least theres this Its not Keanus fault. And thats something. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

"Street Kings | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; street-kings ) Street Kings (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Street Kings has the look and feel of an 80s cop thriller. Despite the predictability of the overall story arc theres suspense and tension to be found between the credit sequences but the movie is saddled with an ending that is both improbable and borderline insulting. Lead actor Keanu Reeves who may never become a great actor has developed enough skill over the years to pull off the role of a dirty cop who begins to grow a conscience. It helps of course that his supporting cast includes Forest Whitaker and Hugh Laurie. Director David Ayer making his second feature has a screenwriting background in cop movies (including Training Day) and co-writer James Ellory is a respected name in the crime genre. The result of this collaboration is a generally strong motion picture that implodes two minutes before it ends. Tom Ludlow (Keanu Reeves) is a dirty cop but not one who takes payoffs or sells confiscated drugs. Instead he has appointed himself as judge jury and executioner and shows a blatant disregard for any law that stands between him and eliminating a bad guy. In short he makes Dirty Harry look like a wimp. When he adds four Korean corpses to his body count Tom finds himself under investigation by Captain Biggs (Hugh Laurie) of Internal Affairs. Things go from bad to worse when Toms former partner and current IA snitch Washington (Terry Crews) is gunned down in a convenience story robbery. Toms boss (Forest Whitaker) tells him to forget about it and move on but Tom partners with homicide detective Diskant (Chris Evans) to follow the evidence and perhaps seek his own redemption. As is often the case in movies of this sort the trail leads deep into a web of police corruption. For the most part Street Kings does what any solid police thriller is supposed to do but this one stumbles badly at the end. The last scene is so contrived and so out of synch with the rest of the film that it has the feeling of something that was tacked-on as the result of either poor test screenings or studio interference. While its true that a bad ending cant completely wreck an otherwise competently executed motion picture this is an example when significant damage is done. The short epilogue in which various unlikely events occur and are revealed undermines the entire narrative structure of Street Kings. If this is supposed to be a ""twist"" its one of the worst ones of the year. Theres another issue with the writing thats more of a curiosity than a problem. As with most police movies all of the major roles go to men. There are however women around in support positions the protagonists love interest the widow of the dead cop etc. Strangely whenever one of those women has a snippet of dialogue its to deliver a sermon. ""Be true to yourself"" ""Find the goodness in your heart"" and so forth. Its bizarre that a movie with such hard-hitting often profane language can occasionally turn out the kind of sentiments more likely to be found on a Hallmark card. Aspects of the movie bear a resemblance to the Mel Gibson revenge picture Payback (a remake of Point Blank) in the way it shows a man using violent methods to make his way up the pecking order to discover the identity of his true enemy. I think the ""revelation"" is intended to be a surprise but it wont be one to anyone familiar with the genre. Theres nothing unexpected about Street Kingss narrative; it follows a formula that has long been established. There are confrontations shoot-outs and a continually mounting body count. Thankfully there are no pointless ""action"" sequences like car chases. The movie is smarter than that which makes the weakness of the ending so confounding. In a way cop movies are like romantic comedies - they only need to do one thing and as long as they do it well theres no need for them to stray from the one true path. Generally speaking Street Kings abides by that maxim. The movie has a strong enough identity to keep the feelings of dA(c)jA  vu largely at bay (although Hugh Lauries character skates a little close to Dr. House for comfort but Hollywood loves to pigeonhole even the best actors) without going so far afield as to alienate die-hard adherents of the genre. Admittedly one could argue that a production helmed by Ayer and co-written by Ellory should generate higher expectations and if thats the case they arent met. Substitute a gutsier ending however and this might have been something to recommend more heartily than with a half-hearted shrug.

In Street Kings a squalid and bloodthirsty policier based on an original story by the author of L.A. Confidential Tom Ludlow (Keanu Reeves) a veteran LAPD vice cop trash-talks racist garbage to a gang of? Korean hoods then storms their lair and shoots them dead with a fury that would leave Dirty Harry scrambling for his tattered copy of the Miranda rights. In the process Ludlow rescues two girls that the gang had been hawking to pedophiles -- and so on the films terms hes a hero. But with heroes like this who needs scumbags? Every so often Keanu Reeves robo-voiced blankness serves him well but when he has to play a pulpy tormented demon-saint scraping up insults and spitting them out like bullets hes like the host of an infomercial doing an impersonation of a badass. Director David Ayer who is best known as the screenwriter of Training Day had a brazen (if little-seen) directorial debut with Harsh Times (2006) in which Christian Bale gave a high-flying almost evil performance as a psycho desperate to be a cop. In the new film Ayer tries for that same volcanic flow but Street Kings is more like L.A. Confidential reduced to a board game. The structure is in place -- the latticework of corruption -- only there are so many scurrilous men pulling strings that we might be watching a parade of nasty puppets with Keanu as the chief wooden devil doll.

Somewhere in Los Angeles police officers are helping old ladies across the street but such acts of chivalry have no place in ""Street Kings"" a brutal look at police corruption that allows director David Ayer and ""L.A. Confidential"" author James Ellroy to pool their deeply cynical insights. Keanu Reeves leads a pack of modern-day cowboys who shoot first and plant evidence later a system that serves the squad well until an ex-partner snitches to Internal Affairs. The gritty pic more than earns its R rating but should open strong regardless and stick around as action-starved auds take in the carnage. Screenplay credit goes to Ellroy Kurt Wimmer and Jamie Moss but Ayers fingerprints are there too. ""Street Kings"" cements the ""Training Day"" scribes standing as Hollywoods go-to LAPD guy reinforcing the writer-directors thesis that the thin blue line deals in shades of gray. Such notions about the widespread abuse of power (in response to the Rodney King incident but given new resonance today) register as far more troubling than anything seen in the Nixon-era ""Dirty Harry"" where it took a single rule-breaker to maintain law and order and yet Ayer judges Reeves Tom Ludlow as a necessary evil. ""Who else is gonna hold back the animals?"" the movie asks. Ludlow operates by any means necessary confident that his longtime commanding officer Jack Wander (Forest Whitaker) will cover for him. Dead suspects dont talk but they go a long way toward advancing the careers of everyone involved as evidenced by the promotions that follow Ludlows cavalier raid on an Asian sex den in the pics opening setpiece. Like the checkered antiheroes of ""Training Day"" and ""Harsh Times"" (Ayers self-financed directorial debut) Ludlow belongs to a class of broken lawmen who drink or dope on the job. Reeves telegraphs Ludlows troubled condition by downing single-swig vodka bottles while speeding between crime scenes but the booze has no visible impact on his behavior; nor does the suggestion that hes coping with his wifes death. All in all Ludlow is grappling with some pretty serious demons but Reeves has never been one for nuance wrestling to convey the mix of renegade and boy scout required. Like a nagging conscience Ludlows former partner Terrence Washington (Terry Crews) shows up on the scene to question his methods. Soon after Ludlow learns the turncoat is selling out his squad to IA and in an implausible scene on which the entire pic hinges confronts him in a convenience store just as a couple gangbangers burst in with guns blazing. Wander and his buddies are quick to clear Ludlows name -- the first sign that theres something far more sinister at work among L.A.s finest. A temporary demotion lands Ludlow on the complaints desk where Ayer unleashes a comic montage of ghetto stereotypes as hookers and hood rats alike air their grievances over how theyve been handled by the police. Pic itself is similarly conflicted glamorizing gunslinging while crying foul over unnecessary force and Ayer proves sensitive to race even as he perpetuates such stock characterizations as the sultry Latina love interest (Martha Higareda) or the clueless white boy (Chris Evans). The helmer embraces the energy and raw style of such William Friedkin films as ""The French Connection"" and ""To Live and Die in L.A."" Like those films the adrenaline-fueled ""Street Kings"" experience is all about being caught up in the moment yet auds need only take a step back to see the plot is riddled with holes (how is it that auds can be so much more attuned to the conspiracy than an experienced officer?). The dialogue is punctuated with police jargon which lends credibility to scenes set within L.A.s roughest neighborhoods as does the brusque Foley work associated with punches and gunshots. Ayer aims for a sense of heightened realism staging the key confrontations operatically enough to ensure word of mouth and repeat viewing. The diverse and talented multiculti cast includes rappers Common and the Game as key villains.
