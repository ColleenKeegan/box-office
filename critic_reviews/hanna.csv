Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 10 2016 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Jun. 10 2016 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Ada Ushpiz Written by Ada Ushpiz Classification PG Country USA Language English The German-Jewish philosopher Hannah Arendt is best known for her observation of ""the banality of evil"" at the trial of the Holocausts administrator Adolf Eichmann in 1961. Many misinterpreted or resented the phrase arguing that to explain evil is to underestimate or excuse it. This solid intellectual biography painstakingly follows the development of Arendts thought as she was forced to flee her privileged surroundings in German academia where she was Martin Heideggers student and lover to France and then the United States. It is on the other hand frustratingly cursory about some details of her personal life and never fully examines the contradictions in a personality shaped by the refugee experience. Arendt passionately embraced humanity in theory and her lovers in practice yet the harshness of some pronouncements betray a person at once removed from fellow feeling.

She was referring to Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann chief enabler of the Holocaust whose 1961 trial she wrote up in a series of New Yorker magazine articles that became the book ""Eichmann in Jerusalem."" The film directed by Ada Ushpiz mostly focuses on Arendts take on the trial and its aftermath and it features extensive footage of her mostly from a 1964 German TV interview.Ushpiz is careful to include naysayers along with supporters of Arendt but the core of her contention - that Eichmann was essentially a cog in a totalitarian regime and therefore in a sense ghoulishly insignificant - is still a flashpoint for controversy. I have always found Arendts attempts to intellectualize horror insufficiently empathetic and this film does nothing to alter my view best expressed by Cynthia Ozick in her essay ""Love and Levity at Auschwitz"" where she writes ""Arendt so proudly sealed in intellect that nothing could penetrate the armor of her synthesis ended less in condemnation than mitigation - her neutered Eichmann is a weak-kneed pharaoh scarcely worth all those plagues.

"Vita Activa raises provocative questions and insights into the life of philosopher Hannah Arendt - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Vita Activa raises provocative questions and insights into the life of philosopher Hannah Arendt Vita Activa Review Hannah Arendt Archive / Zeitgeist Hannah Arendt from the documentary ""Vita Activa -- The Spirit of Hannah Arendt."" Hannah Arendt from the documentary ""Vita Activa -- The Spirit of Hannah Arendt."" (Hannah Arendt Archive / Zeitgeist) Kenneth Turan Even decades after her death in 1975 political philosopher Hannah Arendt remains a figure of intense controversy a situation the woman who said ""there are no dangerous thoughts thinking itself is dangerous"" would doubtless approve of.As revealed in ""Vita Activa The Spirit of Hannah Arendt"" a thoughtful nuanced examination of a complex thinker Arendts willingness to challenge certainties and go against the grain lent her thoughts on topics like totalitarianism and the plight of refugees a force and originality that make them surprisingly relevant today. Our complete summer movie guide gt; Read more movie reviews gt;gt;Open link Directed by Israeli documentarian Ada Ushpiz who has degrees in philosophy and history as well as filmmaking experience ""Vita Activa"" closely examines Arendts ""active life"" with the goal of putting us inside her formative experiences the better to reveal who she was and where her attitudes came from. There are interviews with old friends and academic experts and extensive use of filmed interviews Arendt herself gave (mainly for German television) as well as the effective reading of excerpts from her essays and letters by actress Alison Darcy.""Vita Activa"" concentrates not surprisingly on the celebrated notion of ""the banality of evil"" that Arendt came up with while covering the Israeli trial of one of the prime movers of the Holocaust Adolf Eichmann after coming to view him as not much more than a functionary who only carried out orders.""She believed him she saw him as a little man"" says Holocaust authority Deborah Lipstadt and as a result says Leon Botstein a friend who is now president of Bard College ""people went berserk. She was accused of being a self-hating anti-Zionist Jew.""That contention continues today where newly discovered primary sources seem to indicate that Eichmann was more of a committed Nazi than anyone knew at the time. At the very least as one Israeli academic provocatively points out it is worth asking if Arendt unintentionally ended up creating a new cliche in the process of demolishing old ones. Though the talk is smart and constant here ""Vita Activa"" also benefits from the directors sharp eye for effective often rarely seen newsreel and home-movie footage including shots of German women all but worshipping Hitler and German army officers dressing up as Jews at a costume party. There is also a clip from ""Enchanted Forest"" a 1936 German propaganda film celebrating nature and its place in Nazi ideology.Arendt was born in Germany in 1906 to a family so secular she initially did not know she was Jewish. Even as a small child however she loved books with a passion.At age 18 she studied with Martin Heidegger a married man and one of the rising stars of European philosophy. They had an affair (""a secret love and a difficult love"" says Heideggers granddaughter) a situation that became more fraught when the philosopher morphed into a major apologist for Nazi ideology. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story After the affair ended Arendt went on to study for her doctorate with Karl Jaspers a man she came to consider ""the greatest educator of all time."" In fact ""Vita Activa"" begins with a post-World War II exchange of letters between the two in which Jaspers encourages his former student to view the Nazi depredations ""in their total banality.""That war and the events leading to it were the central factors in Arendts life. The 1933 Reichstag fire simultaneously soured her on politics and shocked her into becoming less of an observer and more of an activist.It also motivated her to leave Germany first for France and later for the United States resulting in a lifetime of refugee status that led her to understand from the inside the powerlessness of that political situation.Though much of ""Vita Activa"" is of necessity serious it also finds room for Arendts personal life including her marriage to German political activist Heinrich Blucher. ""Think of me"" she writes touchingly from a Zionist conference in Switzerland ""and dont forget how to kiss.""An ardent Zionist for a time Arendt came to dislike the idea of a Jewish state her experience in Germany leading her to feel it would inevitably lead to the marginalization of minorities. It was one of her many insights that speak to contemporary reality in provocative ways.------------Vita Activa The Spirit of Hannah ArendtNo ratingRunning time 2 hours 5 minutesPlaying Laemmles Monica Santa Monicakenneth.turanlatimes.com Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times A version of this article appeared in print on April 29 2016 in the Entertainment section of the Los Angeles Times with the headline ""The formation of a complex mind - `Vita Activa provides insights into the life of political philosopher Hannah Arendt. - REVIEW"" -- Todays paperTodays paper | Subscribe Entertainment Movies The Holocaust (1934-1945) Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined TV viewership for Hillary Clintons acceptance speech is smaller than Donald Trumps Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad71deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-vita-activa-review-20160429-column.html,200,hanna2,hanna,latimes

Comments Vita Activa The Spirit of Hannah Arendt Video 125 minutes  2016 Philosopher Hannah Arendt was suspicious of any ideology right wing or left because of their potential to harm people. Born in 1906 she grew up an assimilated Jew in Germany though her lack of religious or patriotic fervor distanced her intellectually and politically from other Germans. The persecution of Jews and others that she witnessed under Nazism (she herself was interned in a camp for a while before escaping) informed her landmark analysis of the modus operandi of totalitarianism. But for all her brilliance many have yet to forgive her for her reporting in Jerusalem on the 1961 war crimes trial of Nazi bureaucrat Adolf Eichmann in which she wrote that he embodied ""the banality of evil."" Israeli director Ada Ushpiz struggles to present the many layers of Arendts life in the proper light and mostly succeeds sticking to her rigorous thought processes while also making them cinematic.

Hannah Arendt might argue that theyre closer than you think A striking new film about the controversial Jewish philosopher explores her theory of fascism -- and it fits Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics 2016 Elections Documentary Donald Trump Editors Picks Film Hannah Arendt Movies Vita Activa The Spirit of Hannah Arendt Entertainment News Donald Trump Hannah Arendt (Credit Reuters/Chris Keane/AP) Hannah Arendt was one of the greatest intellectuals of the 20th century and 40 years after her death she may have eclipsed other figures who seemed bigger at the time. Many of the issues that Jean-Paul Sartre pursued for example feel like arid historical curiosities today informed by Cold War disputes that no one cares about anymore. Arendts central obsessions -- war totalitarianism genocide mass migration and displacement and the ambiguous nature of human rights -- are at least as relevant as ever. In the dismal and farcical age of Donald Trump we badly need something like the scathing cleansing force of Arendts intellect. There are moments in ""Vita Activa The Spirit of Hannah Arendt"" an urgent and often startling documentary from Israeli director Ada Ushpiz where I could feel her trying to reach across the decades and talk to us.Arendt didnt have a high opinion of human nature or human group behavior and given her life experience thats understandable. She was a woman of extraordinary intellectual gifts at a time when there was essentially no such thing as a female philosopher or even a female academic. As Ushpizs film lays out in detail Arendt was a child of privilege in pre-war Germany and then a Jewish war refugee and then an increasingly controversial celebrity who became widely viewed as a traitor to her own people. She remains most widely known today for a phrase that was generally misunderstood and became a cliche -- ""the banality of evil"" part of the subtitle to ""Eichmann in Jerusalem"" her most famous book -- and is still viewed in some quarters as a Jewish anti-Semite or a borderline Nazi apologist.In a passage quoted by Ushpiz which I believe is from the 1951 ""Origins of Totalitarianism"" Arendt proposes that regimes like Nazism or Stalinism thrive by creating narratives that confer imaginary order upon the chaos and randomness of history. Human beings long for coherent stories that explain why bad things happen Arendt says even when those stories are delusional and dangerous. When fueled by enduring political or psychological currents like nationalism and racism such fictional narratives become the justification for war and genocide and other historical crimes. To cite the obvious example from Arendts lifetime if the social chaos and struggling economy of Germany in the 1930s was caused by a predatory Jewish conspiracy that had drained the German people of their life force then everything made sense and the nation could be united toward a common goal and against a common enemy.I doubt I need to belabor the point There is one 2016 presidential candidate who has prospered beyond anyones wildest dreams by constructing just that kind of narrative albeit an especially shapeless and nonsensical one. Arendt I suspect would view Trump as more hilarious than dangerous a weak third-generation photocopy of a Hitler-type rather than the real thing. But his improbable rise would not improve her view of human intelligence considered as a whole and might lead her to downgrade her almost-hopeful view of the possibilities of American democracy. (In fairness Arendt had seen that decay pretty far by the time she died in 1975.)Trumps famous promise to build that wall along the southern border -- and somehow make Mexico pay for it -- at a time when the population of undocumented immigrants is steadily declining is more like an infantile fantasy than a policy proposal. His vow to bar Muslims from entering the country in the face of irrational panic and an exaggerated terrorist threat is pandering of the worst kind. Neither of those things will ever happen and my private opinion is that even most Trump supporters understand that. But those are like plot points in the amorphous Trumpian movie-narrative that whatever went wrong in America is somebody elses fault indeed almost anybody elses. Its more like a field of generalized suspicion and loathing than a coherent story Americas innate greatness has been chewed away by the Muslims the Mexicans the blacks the gays the feminists the transgender bathroom users the liberal elite the intellectual elite the bipartisan political establishment and damn near everybody else who isnt Trump or his downscale white audience.Ushpiz makes a number of bold choices in ""Vita Activa"" that might not have been possible in an Israeli documentary even 10 years ago. She begins with newsreel footage of the Nazi death camps and the immediate postwar period much of it from U.S. Army color films Ive never seen before. But shes using that material almost as context or punctuation to the complicated and difficult story of one womans intellectual odyssey not as the central focus. What Im really talking about though is Ushpizs use of Adolf Hitler who is usually seen but not heard in war documentaries and glimpsed only in a few familiar contexts the Nuremberg rallies or greeting the troops or receiving bouquets from little girls in white dresses. In this film we hear Hitler talk with subtitles -- and he sounds a lot more like Donald Trump than I expected.If you believe the Fuhrers legendary oratory was all fervent strident screeching about the evils of the Jews and the perfidy of the Allied nations well it wasnt. Hate speech is a key ingredient of the fascist dictators rhetorical mix as Arendt might put it but far from the only one. In a speech Ushpiz shows us Hitlers approach is strikingly Trumpian a few nonspecific references to the enemies who are besieging and undermining the Reich blended into a glowing portrait of a paradisiacal future of full employment and universal prosperity dominated by a rising generation of healthy strong and ""peace-loving"" young Germans. It was relentlessly upbeat and strongly resonant of Trumps vow to ""make America great again"" without defining what that means or what it might involve or his promises that his leadership will bring a new era of ""winning"" after decades of ""losing"" if irritating impediments like the constitutional separation of powers can be overcome. You Might Also Like Trump isnt Hitler not least because he represents no more than a vague minority sentiment rather than an organized political party or movement. But he reflects the all-too-human currents of vapidity and weakness that made Hitler possible and that drove Hannah Arendt nuts. Although Ushpiz gives Arendts critics a chance to air their grievances ""Vita Activa"" is clearly meant to argue that the hostile reactions she provoked were unfair and caused her tremendous suffering. Some of the films most striking footage comes from a mid-60s German TV interview during one of Arendts infrequent post-war visits to her birth country. Chain-smoking and disheveled but still ferociously articulate she seems visibly tormented by the publics misperception of the Eichmann book. I suppose she knew by then that it would do no good to point out that she herself had been a refugee from Hitler had spent the war years writing for a Jewish newspaper in New York and after 1945 worked for a Zionist group that resettled Jewish children in Palestine and then Israel.If I can say this as a non-Jew and an outsider to the Holocaust legacy Arendts 1963 ""Eichmann in Jerusalem"" -- a philosophical historical and journalistic account of the trial of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann -- stands in the greatest tradition of rabbinical self-scrutiny and perhaps even Jewish prophecy. Her failing if it was a failing was both political and rhetorical Arendt refused to do anything she understood as intellectually dishonest including flattering the Israeli government for the evident contradictions of the Eichmann show trial which she saw as a symbolic act of blood vengeance (and as such understandable) dressed up as a normal legal proceeding. Similarly she declined to spare the feelings of Holocaust survivors or sanctify their experience with what she perceived as forced religiosity partly because she saw the historical crime committed by the Nazis as a crime against all of humanity rather than a genocide uniquely targeting the Jews. That whole area of discourse remains intensely contested even 55 years after the execution of Eichmann and 70 years after the fall of Hitler. Arendt said and did a number of unfortunate things starting with her tangled relationship with Martin Heidegger her philosophical mentor and sometime lover who joined the Nazi Party in 1933 and (despite later denials) appears to have supported its goals well into the war years. (Some accounts suggest that Arendt resumed her affair with Heidegger after the war when she definitely should have known better.) Her infamous description of the Sephardic Jewish population of Jerusalem as ""an oriental mob as if one were in Istanbul or some other half-Asiatic country"" is redolent of the worst kind of European racism.As for the charge that Arendt felt inadequate empathy for Hitlers victims or that her account of Eichmanns trial amounted to a convoluted apology for his crimes or a claim that he was some minor functionary with no moral responsibility I dont think anyone could read ""Eichmann in Jerusalem"" now and think that. At the time that reaction was understandable and perhaps inevitable Arendt tried to write a work of complex political theory and analytic philosophy on deadline in the aftermath of an enormous historical trauma she had personally experienced. She didnt believe that sentimentality or melodrama would help her come to grips with what had happened or with the distinctive modern personality type she observed in Eichmann a soulless submissive sociopath who indulged his most primitive and hateful instincts as a Nazi official but played the role of humble penitent once he was in the hands of the Jewish state. The Eichmanns are still with us almost everywhere; there was only one Hannah Arendt.""Vita Activa The Spirit of Hannah Arendt"" is now playing at Film Forum in New York.

Photo Hannah Arendt Private Archive. MOVIE REVIEW VITA ACTIVA THE SPIRIT OF HANNAH ARENDT In German Hebrew French and English with English subtitles. Running time 125 minutes. Not rated (violent and disturbing images adult themes). Documentarians Ada Ushpiz and Ina Fichman provide an immersive intro course in Hannah Arendt the German Jewish philosopher who wrote ""Eichmann in Jerusalem."" The film works to rescue Arendt and her phrase ""the banality of evil"" from years of cliche and largely succeeds. Extensive historical footage includes a TV interview with Arendt herself that shows her personality better even than her quoted letters -- Arendts contemptuous smile when describing German intellectuals infatuation with Hitler is something to see. Only in the last half-hour does director Ushpiz grapple with some very real objections to aspects of Arendts work. But as invoked in the film Arendts ideas about refugees statelessness and why nations need plurality seem more haunting and prescient than ever.

Newly relevant forty years after her death the German-born philosophers work is distinctly ill-suited to contemporary tools of relevance. Twitters context of no context values aphorism parody and potted wisdom -- branded content available in bulk. The author of The Human Condition and Eichmann in Jerusalem represents no single school of thought and her most famous work is famously misunderstood making her ideas even less apt for consumption in easily digestible snippets than those of some of her peers (NietzscheQuotes updates every three hours). Arendts independence of mind is responsible for the most brilliant and most maddening aspects of her life and her work both of which remain uniquely difficult to parse.With Vita Activa The Spirit of Hannah Arendt Israeli filmmaker Ada Ushpiz makes an earnest impressively researched attempt to distill her subject. The title in fact belies the films modest stakes and rather straightforward tack Insofar as Ushpiz succeeds in putting the most provocative salient and damning aspects of Arendts work into a lucid context she exposes the limits of her own approach. Those limits are as common as the standard doc format shes chosen The film is a mix of talking-head interviews archival footage (much of which including that of an unidentified execution by firing squad has an unnerving non-sequitur quality) interviews with Arendt and narration consisting largely of passages from Arendts work. The latter paradoxically contributes to a certain inertness; being read aloud in a documentary tends not to serve dense philosophical writing as well as might an energetic treatment of its ideas.Film Details Vita Activa The Spirit of Hannah Arendt RatingNR GenreDocumentary Running Time125 min. More Info Trailer Ushpiz begins where common knowledge of Arendts work generally ends. Published in 1963 Eichmann in Jerusalem A Report on the Banality of Evil consists of Arendts reporting on the 1961 war-crimes prosecution of the Nazi officer. Vita Activa uses as a sort of motif the phrase that came to haunt Arendt teasing out in quotes and moments (including segments of Eichmanns trial) the intricate philosophy it invokes. Evil is not the province of monsters of the unspeakable but a friend to cliche ""a surface phenomenon...the more superficial someone is the more likely he will be to yield to Evil."" This Eichmann was nothing more or less than human not a sadist and perhaps not even an anti-Semite -- but merely a functionary whose evil derived from his inability or unwillingness to think and to empathize.Vita Activa traces the controversy Arendt provoked with this idea; even now notes Arendts friend Richard Bernstein to bring it up is to risk a brawl. Arendt changed her mind on many issues (including the Zionist movement which she supported as a young woman) but she defended until her death her moral philosophy of evil despite the accusations it brought that she was a self-hating Jew an apologist for the Nazis that she had diminished their crimes. The Arendt of the late interviews included in the film is a figure of becalmed exasperation frank but elusive unsettled yet quite certain of herself. EXPAND Courtesy the Hannah Arendt Private Archive Along with Eichmann Ushpiz draws heavily from The Origins of Totalitarianism the book that given the current election season could finally earn Arendt her own Twitter feed. Her ideas on Nazism and Stalinism offer from the far side of geopolitical and humanitarian disasters a warning of where our current moment -- the Middle East refugee crisis the so-called war on terror Donald Trumps candidacy -- might lead. For Arendt who fled Europe for New York City in 1941 the United States seemed an example of what a pluralist society could be and in this offered her a spiritual as well as a physical home.Perhaps in her hunger for that home she overlooked the obvious If nationalism and statelessness are equally dangerous propositions the experience of the latter may dull one to the threat of the former. The rhetoric of freedom as Vita Activa confirms was central to the rise of the Nazi movement. The echoes of that rhetoric in contemporary American politics seem to confirm Arendts suspicion that ""totalitarian solutions may well survive the fall of totalitarian regimes in the form of a strong temptation which will come up whenever it seems impossible to alleviate political social or economic misery in a manner worthy of man.""The most obvious example of Arendt overlooking the obvious involves her complex relationship with German philosopher Martin Heidegger. Vita Activa lightly traces that involvement which began when Arendt was a student of Heideggers frayed when Heidegger expressed support for the Nazi party and resumed briefly after the war; years later Arendt worked to mend her former lovers reputation. Ushpiz makes no excuse for her subject and offers no judgment treating the episode as an extension of the life and mind of a woman who found in contradiction her most enduring home.
