It has enough visual effects and production values for three movies and almost as much story material which is one of its problems. But it does provide vigorous eye-filling entertainment and paves the way for Taylor Kitsch (best known so far from his work on the TV series Friday Night Lights) to become a major movie star. I never read Edgar Rice Burroughs novels about Carter and the planet Mars (known to the locals as Barsoom) but a friend who is a lifelong devotee was quite pleased with this adaptation by director Andrew Stanton Mark Andrews and Michael Chabon declaring it true to the spirit of the books even though it adds many ideas of its own. As one of Pixars star players Stanton is an experienced cinematic storyteller which is why its disappointing that his first live-action project is so unwieldy at times. My challenge was keeping track of the many curious and unusual-looking characters that populate the picture. (All I can say with certainty is that Tharks dont fly.) John Carter (a virile and likable Kitsch) is a Confederate soldier who in the wake of a family tragedy has become uncontrollable a wild animal who is ready to lash out at anyone and everyone. Fate and circumstance transport him to the planet Mars where the lighter gravity gives him the ability to jump and soar about. This impresses even the fiercest warriors he meets including a feisty princess (Lynn Collins) whose father is urging her to marry one of their enemies in order to create a peaceful alliance. The question is whether or not Carter is willing to take sides in a battle that is not his own. This epic-scale production is the latest to offer a visual-effects landscape so palpably real that its impossible to tell where actors and sets leave off and movie magic takes over. At one time this achievement alone would have made John Carter a major event; today it is just the latest in a string of films to show off such technical wizardry. While we can still marvel at the amazing sights laid out before us--like an apparent monster who turns out to be an overgrown puppy-dog-like pet--it is imperative that we never lose sight of whos who and whats at stake. That turns out to be a tall order. I can only call the finished film a mixed bag with exciting scenes followed by dull stretches. But no movie so rich in imagination and so skillfully staged could or should be dismissed out of hand. If you have even the slightest curiosity about John Carter Id encourage you to see it. As to why the folks at Disney decided to leave ""...of Mars"" off the title I have no idea what they hoped to accomplish. Readers have devoured Burroughs novels under that name for decades; turning it into a generic name seems downright silly.

Reply captain carli May 22 2016 1259 am Just the movie on dvd....LOVED IT...Hollywood critics have their head up their a_ _ great movie Reply Cowboy in NC May 22 2016 1259 am I actually first read the entire series way back in 1979-81. I have since read it many times over the years. Im have not yet seen the movie. It will be difficult to impress me since I already have a grasp of the series as it was written not as a screenplay. Hopefully it will do justice to Mr. Burroughs. Reply Clay Grayson May 22 2016 1259 am A pretty good movie. There were some parts that caused me to cringe where major changes had been made from the original book (John Carters past marriage his childish view on taking a stand for a cause for so long etc.) yet other changes showed good sense in trying to ""update"" the story for modern times (Lets face it I doubt the Dejah of the books would have gone over well with a modern audience - but it was written when women were damsels in distress- not the capable warrior women shown in the movie). Yet I cannot help but think that this movie would have been a lot better if it had been done by..well just about anyone but Disney. Reply samalematina May 22 2016 1259 am I really enjoyed this movie. Not having read the source material I had no pre-conceived ideas of what it should be like. Found the whole adventure quite entertaining nothing to fault with the CGI either. And the ending was a great surprise as well. In the end felt for John Carters struggle to find his way back to Mars to be with his martian wife. Would be very interested to see what has transpired while he was away... Reply Deborah May 22 2016 1259 am I LOVED this movie so much I saw it repeatedly at the theater I had not even really heard of it until my brother Kellam tasked me to go with him to see it. We need to campaign to make the DVD sales bigger than the theater sales to get a sequel I need more How can you help us to accomplish this? Seriously... Reply John Eberhardt May 22 2016 1259 am Leonard one of the best reviews of the film that Ive seen. I saw the movie and then read the three books and then saw the movie another seven to ten times (lost count). I had to see it twice to get a good handle on the characters etc. but I do not know how Stanton and company could have hurried it along (learning the language developing characters setting the plot line) without getting even more messed up. More narrative may have helped but I did like the changes that he made from the books and am very curious how he will move them forward to the sequels (in twenty years-lol). On of the main things that I noticed was quite minor- that the music was strange and a bit off for some scenes. I know that I look forward to the water and vegetation that are in the next books will give a different feel to this dry planet (more ""Avatar"" like). Since it is actually still playing in the first run 3D IMAX theaters in Wisconsin (until at least 5/11/2012) after all this time and therefore still making money here at least. I hope the 300 million worldwide (it should be more with DVD/Blu-Ray sales) is enough to warrant another look at John Carter of Mars. Reply C. Lynch May 22 2016 1259 am I read the books and really looked forward to this film. I was not disappointed. Yes there were some changes but to my mind most enhanced the original Burroughs saga. I cant understand why the reviews were so blah and the film didnt do better at the box office. I thought it was great Maybe the general movie going public has become jaded in this age of short attention spans and instant gratification. SciFi owes most of what it is today to this century-old icon. Reply S. Wolf May 22 2016 1259 am Minor aside when we went to see it last night (April 6th) the cineplex where we went has eleven automated ticket machines. No less than EIGHT of them were out of order. Ill let you imagine what the lineups were like. And the studios wonder why people arent going to the movies as much as they used to? Reply S. Wolf May 22 2016 1259 am Mostly agree. Visually amazing script-wise not bad at all taking the 100 year-old story and updating it successfully (I thought) adding bits which helped it make more sense. But ... there were parts where the dialogue was almost painful and the occasional - though mercifully few - scenes where the fly-by-wire was really more obvious than it had any right to be. Pity it has taken such a(n undeserved) drubbing at the box office. Id have loved to see what the Barsoom saga could be like in a possible sequel helmed by a more competent director. Reply David May 22 2016 1259 am I know why they leave off ""of Mars"" in the title it has to do with the story arch but you will see it at the end It blew my mind a great film I would encourage everyone to go if you can get past the impossible consideration this is an amazing idea and a big what if attached... what if it were somehow true in some form in some other time ? Go see it Reply frostback May 22 2016 1259 am It looks like there were creative differences with the director. Heres what makes me think so. When you look at the 10-minute trailer of the movie it starts right where the story does with the reading of John Carters journal by his favorite nephew young Edgar Rice Burroughs. From there we go to Arizona (once) and then on to Mars. This is a jump back in time but it makes perfect sense in terms of the story. This tells me that the trailer was put together the way the director saw the story. In ""John Carter"" the opening sequences are arranged precisely in the order of the time when they happen. While that may seem to be a logical almost self-evident way to go it doesnt always work in story-telling. ""John Carter"" helps us to see why. In ""John Carter"" we first meet Sab Than and the Therns on Mars. Why? We dont know yet but it does happen first of all the events in the story. Then on earth we meet John Carter at Fort Grant. Why? Were still not sure but it does happen next in the order of time. Then thirteen years later we go to New York for the reading of the will -- the beginning point of the trailer. Only then do we go back in time to the cave in Arizona and on to Mars. This tells me that the actual opening of the movie wasnt put together by the director. It was assembled by someone else. No new footage was involved. They didnt understand how the story was supposed to unfold after all of the footage was shot. And thats the directors job. Reply Bob Walden May 22 2016 1259 am Spot on Mr. Maltin I have read the Mars series several times when I was much younger and Disneys adaptation does justice to ""A Princess of Mars"". While not pleasing to the nitpickers it brought tears to my eyes on several occasions for the spirit of the story. Dont let the story die with the naysayers. ""John Carter"" lives Reply tfleig May 22 2016 1259 am What a great story what a great adventure movie Disney/Pixar had the guts and the talent to put this classic scifi/adventure story on the screen and they did a good job. The scenery is greatthe cgi and characters are believable and they followed the book and its wonderful imagination barring a few changes to help the condensed story. Mr Kitsch does a fine job and the beautiful Ms. Collins brought princess Dejah Thoris to life. Disneys marketing department really dropped the ball on marketing this movie. Go see it you wont be sorry. Nice job Disney.... Please make the sequels these will be classics. Reply Vi Janaway May 22 2016 1259 am Thank you for a fair review. It bothers me a lot that there is still the assumption that women dont like science fiction and fantasy. I am a woman. I have been reading science fiction and fantasy and watching movies for more than fifty years. I was very familiar with the books and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Mr. Stanton and crew did well. Reply Tarit May 22 2016 1259 am I read that the marketing people at Disney presented a research prior to the launch that said that theyd never get a female into the cinema if they used the term ""..of Mars"" and then it just became John Carter. John who? In my opinion the title lost its allure and I just dont believe that research. Even if itd be true what about the guys who planned to take their girls with them? How many guys did they lose by dropping ""...of Mars.""? Reply frostback May 22 2016 1259 am The novel ""A Princess of Mars"" starts the story so simply but the movie ""John Carter"" feels like it starts four or five times before it finds its groove. Just as soon as we get an idea of whats going on in one place we have to go somewhere else. From Mars to Arizona then New York -- it takes a good half hour to settle down into the story we will follow -- John Carters journal read by his heir. By then people whove never read the book are totally lost. Thats a shame because this film looks like a 200 million-dollar production. With the original title and a bit of publicity it would have done well as it seems to be doing internationally. Reply Josh P May 22 2016 1259 am A great movie has some flaws but then again Ive never seen a perfect movie nor have I ever seen a so called ""perfect movie"" ever accomplish or even try to accomplish what John Carter does through action CGI 3D story and attempting to create a jounrey to inverse viewers in. Only ""real"" mistake made on John Carters behalf was made by Disney through marketing and their ""flop"" speculation childish rich old white men (Im white so wasnt a racist comment lol). Join the FB fanpage to help fight for a sequel Reply jeff May 22 2016 1259 am wasnt happy with the tardos mors characterization or matai shang but overall it was an entertaining film Reply Jhan Davis May 22 2016 1259 am Loved it. As for why ""...of Mars"" isnt on the front end take the time to sit through the closing credits. Disney shows us the change of the movies name only after the movie has shown us the change of John Carters heart. I left wanting to see it again. Reply Robert Hermann May 22 2016 1259 am I went to see John Carter twice in one week first time in Imax 3D at the Valley Forge Regal (Which is the premier Imax theatre in the region) in Pennsylvania I liked Carter but wasnt entirely happy with the look of the film I then went to see the flat version later in the week Enjoyed the second (flat)viewing much better than the 3D The flat version was brighter more colorful and could see more details in the sets I found the 3 D Imax version somewhat dark especially the first 20 minute western segment I had the same problem with last years Imax version of Pirates On Stranger Tides Since Imax has switched from film to digital the projection on the non-animated and post conversion 3D films ARE TOO dark. The glasses dont help either. On a scale of 1 to 10 I give the 3D Imax Version a 4 and a half rating and the flat version an 8. Reply KWB May 22 2016 1259 am Before going to the movie I read Princess of Mars and Gods of Mars. I was enchanted by the story telling and adventure of Edgar Rice Burroughs and equally delighted with the movie. It stayed true to the spirit and images of the original and caught me up in this wonderfully imagined alien world. The movie even improved on some of the weaker aspects of Burroughs stories especially how Carter got to Mars in the first place. I cant help but feel that the professional critics have not read the original stories. The movie only seems derivative because Lucas Spielberg Cameron and others already used so many of the elements that were original with Burroughs. I think it is a wonderful movie so ignore the critics go see it and enjoy Reply Glenn May 22 2016 1259 am I thought the film was fantastic though as an avid reader of the books I was dissapointed at the grab five pages from this book and two from another. Complete changes to the stories and the removal of most of the romance. Never the less it was a very enjoyable film. As for not being able to tell the Tharks apart I didnt see it. As with Avatar the Tharks were Very easily identifiable from each other. 4.5 Stars from me.... if the story was truer to the books it would have gotten 5 Stars. Reply Two Fans May 22 2016 1259 am Just went to see it and thought it was fantastic. Reminded me of when the first Star Wars movie came out. Sort of part pirates part cowboys part Roman gladiators part sci-fi. Would love to see a sequel. Great 3D too - tastefully done. Reply rich May 22 2016 1259 am I went to see this with my 13 year old and we had a very good time. It was at times difficult to keep up with some of the character roles but all in all a very good movie. 4.5 stars. Reply Ermin Concepcion May 22 2016 1259 am I have seen the movie I see no fault nor boring moments. I am just wondering why the review seems not as good as the movie really is. The story telling is perfect the actors and actresses are fitted for their role special effects are awesome. I love the dog-looking alien pet creature. I just love the movie. Dont listen to heresays let you alone decide for yourselves what the movie really is. Reply The Wyz May 22 2016 1259 am Just exactly what does it take to impress modern audiences? Please read some of the reviews at Amazon.com because this movies has 4 1/2 out of 5 there. Reply bob neilson May 22 2016 1259 am For a different view on this movie visit http//bobneilson.org/2012/03/14/john-carter-stillborn-franchise/ Reply Pam Q May 22 2016 1259 am I am glad I did not read any reviews before seeing this. It was an excellent adventure. I knew nothing about it and enjoyed it so much I cant wait to see it again. Reply TomA!s May 22 2016 1259 am Woola steals the show. Its a pity the rest of the cast are not up to him. Perhaps Errol Flynn and Sophia Loren would have played the parts well. But of course at that time the technology was not at the level of E.R.B. imagination. Oh well. On a serious note I agree with the person that compares his use of a Confederate ex-soldier as a character at the time the novels were written with a Vietnam veteran now. The same sadness. Remember Rambo?. Reply Stephen J May 22 2016 1259 am Thank you for a thoughtful balanced review. You are right that the film suffers from not being the first to do the amazing things it does with landscapes characters and alien artifacts. And as a movie the plot may seem either derivative or too complicated. But of course the Burroughs story is one of the oldest in the pulp action F/SF genre. And as for complicated - well who made up a rule that says action movies have to have plots so simpleminded you dont have to think? Some lobbying group that markets beer to teenaged boys? It was nice to see some effort made to have complex characters and plot layers even if they didnt always work. And the movie was total good fun anyhow Reply Russ The Moon Cat May 22 2016 1259 am ps (sorry). yeah leaving ""..of Mars"" off the title is just insane. How much are these marketing people paid to come up with these great ideas. Its simple - go to a 12 year old kid. ""Do you wanna see a movie called John Carter...."" Kid ""Uh....dunno"" ""...OF MARS"" Kid ""Hell yeah"" Simple innit? Reply Russ the Moon Cat May 22 2016 1259 am I saw it a couple of days ago and thought it was fantastic. Im a medium fan of the books but I thought this was a beautifully presented epic - David Lean does Mars in some respects - and had an engaging lead supported by a great cast of character actors. Its a shame that all the negativity generated by the mess that was the marketing campaign appears to have done for the film before anyones had a chance to see it. I also wonder whether jaded sensibilities have clouded a potential audience for it like some kind of blockbuster fatigue. I really hope that positive word of mouth has some impact because while ""John Carter"" isnt flawless by any means it is a lovingly crafted and rendered epic with pleasing pulp sensibilities and really deserves to be seen and to suceed. Barsoom is a pretty awesome place to spend a couple of hours I can tell you Reply John Jacobson May 22 2016 1259 am I saw the film last Friday and being a Burroughs fan who discovered John Carter in high school I was very pleased about how it turned out. I do think that anyone who is not familiar with the books would have a difficult time following the action but any fan of the Warlord of Mars should be quite happy with the outcome. Disney should have made it clearer that it was from Burroughs writing in their advertising. Reply Tony Caruana May 22 2016 1259 am As a critic over here in the UK said "" Its a 250000000 B movie"". Approached like that its quite enjoyable. Reply Paul9 May 22 2016 1259 am If you read the books as a boy you will have no trouble following the movie; and it will be obvious why it was not entitled ""John Carter of Mars."" For four-year-olds going on seventy who did read the Mars Series as a boy and liked them the Movie is a MUST SEE despite its Title. Reply D. Kingsley Hahn May 22 2016 1259 am Baby boomer readers originally introduced to John Carter and Barsoom in the series of mass market paperbacks published by Ace and Ballantine in the early 1960s should finally be able to breathe a heavy sigh of relief that a film has finally been released that lives up to the epic qualities of the source material. Confusing plots and characters? So what -- so was ""Star Wars"" when we first viewed it in 1977 This is NOT a stand-alone film people -- Disney should definitely have warned us that this was Part One of a trilogy; but stick with it -- your questions will be answered Meanwhile see the film again; then perhaps read the first three John Carter books (also available in audiobook or ereader format). Then maybe youll understand why those of us who first read the books 50 years ago are excited and pleased. This is John Carter done RIGHT ERB would be pleased Reply Scott Warwick May 22 2016 1259 am Im not certain but I think the reason for the title change was a cheap and not-very-good made-for-TV movie shown on the syfy network last year. It starred Traci Lords as Dejah Thoris. Obviously Disney would not release a movie with the same title within a year or so of such a stinker. Being a fan of the books I tried to watch it.....and just couldnt. And by the way this was Edgar Rice Burroughs first book (well OK Norman Beans first book) and the writing... well Stan Lee was being interviewed by someone who had been a Spiderman fan. When he asked Stan if he was disappointed by the changes made to the character Stan smiled and became my hero by saying "" hey it aint Shakespeare"" The changes preserved the spirit of the story. I noticed that some folks dont like the fact that John Carter is a Confederate veteran. You do realize that Burroughs peobably KNEW Civil War veterans right? It would be about the same as using a Viet Nam War vet in a story now timeline wise. Quit griping about the details.....This was a truly GREAT movie and should be seen and enjoyed by all. Reply robert d May 22 2016 1259 am Was a great movie... only thing that was bad was that it Ended Not sure why so many of the critics are dissing this movie... maybe they just do not like Disney? Seriously this movie is EPIC Reply J May 22 2016 1259 am The move was great - saw it in 3D on IMAX - all I can say is whow Something we can go see for a change -tell all to see it Reply KillKatie May 22 2016 1259 am Warning Spam Trap Katie is a liar Reply erbfan May 22 2016 1259 am Im a life long Burroughs fan and felt I had the most to lose as a poor movie would be a total failure in my eyes I took my 10 year old grandson and soon realized I have someone to pass my love of Burroughs to he throughly enjoyed the movie and sat enthralled through the whole movie we are ready to see it again and look forwards to the next installment Reply SirOtter May 22 2016 1259 am I just saw it and was only disappointed when it was over. Regardless of the fairly minor changes some for the better it was from beginning to end virtually the film I saw in my minds eye when I read A Princess of Mars over forty years ago. Id love to personally thank everyone involved for creating the Barsoom I first encountered when I was twelve and taking me back to that magical age again. And from this day forward Lynn Collins will always be the Incomparable Dejah Thoris to me. Well done Reply Historybuff May 22 2016 1259 am Am I the only person here who is disappointed in Disney for trying to drum up sympathy and dare I say support for such a vile character. A confederate soldier who fought long and hard to keep people oppressed on his planet gets a conscience and wanted to liberate a race of oppressed people on another planet. I cant possibly be the only person who sees the irony here. Reply cyndi May 22 2016 1259 am I went with my son and I was surprised to be totally enthralled. Greatly enjoyed the film and the effects are amazing. I hope there will be another. Reply C.J. Hicks May 22 2016 1259 am Actually the title IS ""John Carter of Mars."" At least thats what it was on the screen when I saw it Friday. The massive advertising campaign is simply ""John Carter"" of course but when the title came up at the conclusion to my great surprise it said ""John Carter of Mars."" And if Im correct Mr. Maltins style for his ""Movie Guide"" has always been to go by how it shows up on the film (i.e. ""Superman"" as opposed to ""Superman a The Movie""). Reply Jim May 22 2016 1259 am As with most Hollywood adaptions of popular novels they have taken their own license in the telling of the story which in many cases deviates from the original story. This movie is no exception. Having read all 3 of the original John Carter stories (there are more but dont center on John Carter) I recognized deviations from the get-go but in one instance explained (though from the 3 book series out of order) the method by which John Carter was transported mysteriously to Barsoom. There are many other inconsistencies and interweaving of characters and plots from books 2 amp; 3 but nonetheless the movie proved to be a fairly accurate depiction of the characters and the interractions of their civilizations and the history of Mars as envisioned by Burroughs. I found it thoroughly entertaining and satisfying in mollifying my need for matching the books though it did make John Carter more fragile than the books do. Reply Norm May 22 2016 1259 am Pass...even Maltins comments cant save this muddle...Get a Good Script Good Actors and then build the film...something is out of order...But I do think reading the books would be the best... Reply Loved it May 22 2016 1259 am Just came back from seeing it and enjoyed it immensely. A good old fashioned sci-fi matinee sort of film which was a GOOD thing in my opinion Seemed pretty easy to follow to me but if youre not used to sci-fi/fantasy I suppose it could be harder to follow - anyway I recommend it highly for any sci-fi buff. Reply Chris Ottinger May 22 2016 1259 am Actually the real title is ""John Carter Warlord of Mars."" As you can see the title used by Burroughs when referring to his hero would not be very ""PC"" today. After reading Maltins review Im encouraged as one of the things that would have absolutely killed me would have been to take this marvelous premise from 1912 and fill it full of Hollywood producer fluff. It sounds like weve some of that of course I mean they made the Red Skull part of Hydra or whatever instead of working directly for der Fuhrer but it doesnt so too awfully overblown. Now Im just wondering if its worth springing for the 3D version. Reply Eagledriver May 22 2016 1259 am I heard the stink off MARS NEEDS MOMS was so bad that Disney will never use the word Mars again. Reply Thomas L. May 22 2016 1259 am I just went and saw it and Im sorry to say I only lasted through the first 35 minutes. The special effects the creativity of the alien creatures the flying ships all lent to amazing possibilities for the film but trying to follow the story line and the whos who of the characters was far too daunting. I walked out chalking it up to one of those movies youll rent for a dollar on some rainy sunday when youve nothing better to do. Reply H.McK May 22 2016 1259 am I enjoyed John Carter tremendously truly finding a sense of wonder and awe that was amiss to my imagination in the likes of the Star Wars prequels and even Avatar. And although the plotting was convoluted at times in John Carter this wasnt a film made by the numbers but one that held its convictions in open hand and offered the viewer to take. And I certainly took; finding the performances likeable and imagery superb -- more convincing that most anythw else of this type that I can recall in recent years. The 3D.was also very good and perhaps lacking more than anything was a truly heroic score. But this IMHO is streets ahead of the sci-fi/fantasy pack of the current decade and I hope it does well. (3 stars) Reply Skip Huston May 22 2016 1259 am I am advertisng the film at my theater as Edgar Rice Burroughs JOHN CARTER OF MARS. It is this way on our website our marquee our Facebook page and every other media source we have control of. Disney is not paying for these promos; I am. As such I feel I have the right to rectify what their marketing execs have really dropped the ball on. Reply Dave Petty May 22 2016 1259 am Ignore the critics read the book (you can do so for free at Project Gutenberg http//www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/62 or audio book http//www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19515) see the movie. Reply Jeffrey May 22 2016 1259 am This is not up my alley. The first three months of the year have been slim pickings indeed. Reply H Poulter May 22 2016 1259 am I read that Disney marketeers found the phrase ""of Mars"" tested badly with female movie-goers. Stanton had already dropped ""Princess"" from the title because that word is BO poison with young males. I hope the movie does well enough to allow Stanton to make a sequel - on the other hand Id like to see him make more Pixar films. Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Disney You can take the boy out of Pixar but can you take Pixar out of the boy? That question was raised last year by Mission Impossible-Ghost Protocol and now by John Carter the first two big live-action films to be directed by members of Pixars enviable stable of writer/producer/directors. The provisional answer Im happy to report is no--or at least not entirely. The Pixarian in question this time is Andrew Stanton who in addition to directing Finding Nemo and Wall-E essentially served as the studios in-house screenwriter on its first five films and has played some role (executive producer voice actor) in every Pixar film save Cars 2. As a movie John Carter is not near the level of Stantons Pixar work--but then how could it be? The studios magic is in large part the result of its collaborative ethos and the animators freedom from the demands of a live-action shooting schedule. Still the modest charms of John Carter are another reminder that Pixars success is due not merely to a triumph of process but to a collection of exceptional individual filmmakers.The plot is not a selling point. But the film understands that at the end of the day we are there to have fun. The first installment of the John Carter saga upon which the movie is loosely based was penned by Edgar Rice Burroughs (of Tarzan fame) 100 years ago. Entitled Under the Moons of Mars when it was first published serially and retitled A Princess of Mars when it was later released as a novel it is an ur-text of modern genre fiction--pulp science fantasy and superhero--an important forebear not only of Superman but of Brave New World as well. It is however by any objective measure an awful book inert in style haphazard in plot and woefully annihilatingly devoid of humor. Given such source material Stantons John Carter might easily have been the kind of glum tooth-clenchingly self-serious ""entertainment"" of which we have seen so much in recent years. But its not. Rather Stanton embraces the inescapable ridiculousness of his premise and adds several additional doses of likable whimsy.Said premise is that in 1868 a former Confederate cavalryman named John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) is prospecting for gold in Arizona when he is unexpectedly transported to Mars--or Barsoom as it is known to the natives. (The name sounds rather like an exotic scent for men--sandalwood perhaps?--though the resonance is presumably unintentional.) A war is taking place between two cities with heavily tattooed human-like inhabitants Helium (the good guys devoted to peace and science) and Zodanga (the bad guys devoted to conquest and pillage). You can probably guess which side is winning. What neither side knows is that both are being manipulated by a race of immortal unimaginably advanced beings called the Therns who thrive on conflict.John Carter meanwhile finds himself in different company altogether as a captive of the decidedly inhuman Tharks--primitive martial creatures with green skin four arms and tusks. Luckily for him he quickly discovers that thanks to the weaker gravity of Mars he is imbued with superhuman strength and the ability to jump great distances (the latter trait destined to be rather over-utilized by the filmmakers). Will John Carter impress the Tharks with his cunning and prowess? Will he aid Helium in its fight for survival? Will he and the lovely princess of Helium (Lynn Collins) wind up smooching? The answers are unlikely to surprise you.High-tech/low-tech sci-fi/western hybrids of this kind inevitably find themselves in dangerous territory--Cowboys amp; Aliens territory Wild Wild West territory. Moreover the plot of John Carter if you have not already surmised as much is not a selling point for the film. (Though it bears noting that goofy as it is it makes a great deal more sense in Stantons telling than it did in Burroughss.) The action sequences are for the most part unremarkable and in many cases resemble scenes from the Star Wars movies to a degree that teeters between homage and plagiarism. And while there are some nice painterly backgrounds on display throughout the film the special effects are hardly cutting edge.Yet despite such shortcomings there is a hokey charm to John Carter a clear understanding that at the end of the day we are there to have fun. Stanton has scattered throughout the script a surprising number of genuinely witty moments. (I laughed more during the film than I did during Adam Sandlers last three comedies combined--which is a long way of saying I laughed.) And his cast delivers performances ranging from the entirely solid to the rather good. Related Story John Carters Strange 100-Year Journey to the Big Screen In the first category are the two leads Kitsch (from Friday Night Lights) and Collins (the doomed love-interest/character-motivation in X-Men Origins Wolverine). Neither wows but neither disappoints and Kitsch offers an unexpected hint of Timothy Olyphants lupine appeal. Moreover the films performances improve as we move out from the center. Dominic West and Mark Strong are deep in their comfort zones as respectively the sneering treacherous warlord of Zodanga and the quietly malevolent leader of the Therns. Willem Dafoe has a number of the movies better jokes as the voice of Tars Tarkas the Thark chieftain; and James Purefoy as a warrior of Helium has perhaps the best. But the most indelible performance in the film is not strictly speaking a performance at all. Rather it is--perhaps appropriately--a feat of animation. This would be Woola a six-legged razor-toothed Martian hound who serves as John Carters captor and later companion and who rather resembles a cross between a bulldog and a fetal gila monster. As you might imagine hes not much in the looks department but its been some time since cinema has seen a more adorable sidekick. Late in the film Strongs cold-blooded Thern warns Carter against taking sides in the war between Helium and Zodanga explaining ""You dont have a dog in this fight."" Hes wrong of course in every way.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

Disney/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Video John Carter trailer introduced by director Andrew Stanton Monitor Movie Guide I dont usually bring up a films budget in a review but the reported 250 million price tag for ""John Carter"" gives one pause. I suppose one could argue that masterpieces have no price. Then again ""John Carter"" is no masterpiece.Based on sci-fi books by Edgar Rice Burroughs primarily his ""Princess From Mars"" the film is about a former Confederate soldier Taylor Kitschs John Carter who ends up on Mars and ends up embroiled in a galactic war that looks like a cross between ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""The Fall of the Roman Empire."" There are nine-foot-tall tusked four-armed creatures that bear a disconcerting resemblance to Jar Jar Binks. There are also a slew of human or humanoid meanies some of them shape-shifting and for the love interest the warrior princess Dejah (Lynn Collins) whose blue eyes make Paul Newmans seem lackluster. It all plays tolerably well (in 2D which is how I saw it or presumably in 3D IMAX) but it keeps harkening back to much better movies especially ""Planet of the Apes"" and well ""The Empire Strikes Back.""Its director is Pixar whiz Andrew Stanton who directed ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Wall-E"" and the script lists the wonderful novelist Michael Chabon as one of its contributors. So why is everything so thuddingly fun-free? Maybe that budget scared people off. Grade C+ (Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action.)

The guy will end up with the girl the heroine will live to fight another day and the gruff man from nowhere will turn out to have been cleverly hiding a soft spot underneath all that bravado this whole time. Rom-coms begin to feel like a speed dating exercise where every table is populated by ex-girlfriends. ""Ah yes"" you think sidling up to the table ""I remember now this will be unpleasant."" Which is why epic fantasies provide such a vital mix because you dont know the rules of the game and the genre can replace narrative tropes with relative impunity. Placing a film almost entirely on Mars is a beautiful thing because of the lack of back story the unclear motivations and the red (oh so red) surface. In this manner John Carter has a decided advantage we cant predict what we havent seen before. Though it treads the trodden trail of The Neverending Story Willow and Labyrinth in terms of fantasy appeal there are also huge doses of science fiction thrown in. Its Serenity meets Prince of Persia if only Prince of Persia wasnt terrible. But Im getting ahead of myself and there are a few things to be aware of prior to seeing John Carter. Director Andrew Stanton helped to write this lil epic and lets pause for a moment to be really proud of him. He also wrote and directed Wall-E and Finding Nemo those alone earn him a lifetime of free drinks in my beachfront cabana bar no further achievements necessary. The film starts on Mars with a seemingly random action sequence before segueing to pre-1900s America and then finally pivoting to the old west. The first 25 minutes it must be mentioned lack any semblance of momentum and clarity. But this is Stanton at his finest laying the groundwork luring you in with an essential gamblers dilemma. Things will get better right? And when they do wont you lift your hands up in exultation? They do and you will. When we finally reach the alien planet the character of John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) starts to round into form. Hes immediately attacked and taken hostage. He has no notion of where he is or how to get back hes as disconcerted and discombobulated as a fellow who looks like he belongs in an underwear ad can be. He knows not this Barsoom or how to proceed. Technically he doesnt even know his new location is called ""Barsoom"" by the local populace but that will come. An alien named Tars Tarkas (voiced by Willem Dafoe) attempts to ascertain his value poking and prodding shackling and demanding he jump for him. Oh yes John Carter is a really excellent jumper due the variance in his bone density vis a vis Earth. From there on well be immersed in Barsooms politics replete with conspiracies and princesses. Where John Carter continually gets it right is pacing levity and breadth of story. As an audience unfamiliar with Martian customs and life forms each corner of the film is an opportunity for knowledge. Or in some cases jokes. Or exposition tying characters motivations together. Good guys can be contextually bad and each species has its own goals and value system. Its an incredibly complex story but framed through the intimacy of focused character-driven plot building. The length can be felt a bit the 3-D is (as per normal) pointless and Im not at all confident that theres an internal logic in place. Still none of that derails the endeavor and in the moment youll find yourself intrigued. You want to know more about this world the lives and causes on it and how it will all end. In those final moments of screen light Martian and Earther will blend and youll find yourself wanting to go back wanting to know more.

"After a long strange trip John Carter goes nowhere |       NJ.com comments After a long strange trip John Carter goes nowhere Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on March 09 2012 at 809 AM View/Post Comments Frank Connor/DisneyTaylor Kitsch as John Carter. For true sci-fi fans its the first Martian chronicle -- and a long-delayed movie dream. Edgar Rice Burroughs John Carter series began as a magazine serial a hundred years ago. It came back strongly in the 70s in new hardcover editions with classic Frank Frazetta-illustrated jackets. But a big-budget movie version always remained as close -- and far away -- as that angry red planet in the sky. Until now. After a lot of movies that almost got made and one that probably shouldnt have been -- a direct-to-DVD ""Princess of Mars"" with Traci Lords -- Disney has finally given us ""John Carter."" And for once avid fanboys who know everything about the series and curious newbies who know nothing will probably be united in their response Mixed. Yes director Andrew Stanton has been relatively faithful to the source material keeping Carter as a 19th-century adventurer whose astral spirit travels to the ancient dusty planet. And yes there are still different-colored Martians and six-limbed creatures and monstrous predators (although were only told about the infamously vicious banth). Thats all great -- particularly the Martian flying machines that soar on wings of glass. But when the script fiddles with Burroughs ideas particularly in its strange nearly motiveless arch-villains it slows down. And when the movie relies on Stanton completely it grinds to halt. As one of Pixars stars -- he directed ""Finding Nemo"" and ""WALL-E"" -- Stanton is both a filmmaker with a visual style and someone whom the Disney studio wanted to keep happy even to the extent of funding this extremely expensive 3-D epic. But his skills as a computer animator dont transfer easily to live-action filmmaking. Yes the film looks great although the effects can be spotty -- not surprisingly the lizard-like Tharks look far better alone in motion-capture than en masse in CGI. (The films best performance is courtesy of Willem Dafoe who plays Tars Tarkas.) But the work of the leads only proves Stanton is used to working with cartoons. As Dejah Thoris Princess of Helium -- one Burroughs place name that really could have been changed -- Lynn Collins vainly attempts to act with her toned midriff and unnaturally blue eyes. And Taylor Kitsch all fake swagger and gravelly stoicism tries to evoke ""The Good the Bad and the Ugly"" but only channels ""Jonah Hex."" Certainly the action sequences are terrific -- theres a surprising Coliseum-style duel to the death some fine aerial sequences and enough hand-to-hand slaughter to give even Conan pause. But whenever the fighting stops and two people have to stand and talk all the air goes out of everything. Suddenly it feels as if were in an empty theater watching a dusty old sword-and-sandal epic. Even the wall-to-wall soundtrack music cant bring it to life. Of course the stakes were always high. This is a big movie based on a fan favorite and that brings out extremes in people -- true believers want to pronounce every adaptation a classic and cynics want to see every ambitious project go down in flames. Both are going to be disappointed here. But so is the average fan who -- expecting heroes and wonders -- gets only cardboard actors and a few hours of eye candy. Ratings note The film contains violence. John Carter (PG-13) Disney (132 min.) Directed by Andrew Stanton. With Taylor Kitsch Lynn Collins. Now playing in New Jersey.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 09 2012 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 223PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Rumbling now into a theatre near you the first blockbuster is early in arriving this year - lets blame the mild winter. Certainly theres no mistaking its credentials. The gargantuan price tag the pulp-novel brand the extraterrestrial setting the CGI adornments the 3-D camera the warriors the princess the effects John Carter is epic by every measurement. So it would be only fitting to issue a verdict in keeping with that scale. Epically fantastic would be a welcome change although epically awful would at least keep the symmetry. Alas epically bland will have to do. Frame grab from trailer for John Carter. Movies John Carter The official trailer Taylor Kitsch at the John Carter premiere in London. Reuters Celebrity Video Taylor Kitsch at John Carter premiere Cast members Taylor Kitsch right and Willem Dafoe pose together at the premiere of ""John Carter"" in Los Angeles Wednesday Feb. 22 2012. The film opens in theaters on March 9. Matt Sayles / AP Movies Video Taylor Kitsch talks about John Carter demands It isnt bad so much as innocuous 250-million worth of innocuous framed by a decent start and a solid finish but sagging through the long middle like a cheap mattress. Then whats billed as a tonic plays like a soporific leaving the fiercest battle to be waged in your seat - yawns must be vanquished and sleep fought off. Of course the blockbuster has long been an enthusiastic miner of pulp fiction. This one enjoys the distinction of digging deeper into the past all the way back to Edgar Rice Burroughs and his Barsoom series published early in the last century. The screenwriting trio of Mark Andrews novelist Michael Chabon and director Andrew Stanton have adapted the first book in the saga borrowed a bit from later instalments and spun out the yarn over a two-hour-plus running time - ample by most standards yet still not enough to contain the clutter of this sprawling plot. Our eponymous hero begins in the divisive climate of mother Earth. A disillusioned vet of the American Civil War John Carter (the unfortunately named Taylor Kitsch) avoids the clutches of the army only to find himself inside a cave of gold and mysteriously transported smack into the midst of another internecine conflict. He awakens in the arid desert of Mars (Barsoom in the native lingo) where the city states of Helium and Zodanga have been going at it for millennia. Different planet same old bloody strife perhaps because both these cities are populated by humanoids who look much like us - indeed exactly like those of us whose taste in body art runs exclusively to red tattoos. Not so the Tharks. Green-hued nine feet tall tusks protruding from their upper region boasting a complementary pair of spare arms these folks seem like the real Martian deal. Their leader Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe + digital enhancement) takes a shine to Carter especially to his acrobatic skill in the lower gravity of Marss atmosphere - the guy can jump in prodigious leaps and bounds. Since flying humans should always be a visual treat it offers Stanton who made his rep in Pixar animation his first directorial test in live action. He fails and the 3-D glasses do nothing to boost his grade. Much better are his CGI sets which impressively depict the ecological death rattle of a dying planet as vast waterless plains give way to crumbling spires of urban decay. Through this bleak landscape Carter and his new pals - Tarkas the maternal Sola and Woola the amiable monster - trek off in the direction of Helium and its lovely princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins). Apparently in an ill-advised attempt to broker a peace Ms. Thoris is being forced into a political marriage with the villainous king of Zodanga. Happily she and the Earthling hit it right off. Sparks fly at first sight and love blooms even in the red desert. But that long middle patch is upon us - prepare for a seemingly interminable sag. Perhaps the problem is simply that the Burroughs material has already been heavily plundered by others influencing the likes of Arthur C. Clarke and George Lucas and James Cameron. From shape-shifting to glowing medallions from flying machines to sword fights from the stranger to the strange land hellishly growling beasts to the massive clash of alien armies few will have trouble picking up on these influences. But the irony is obvious At this point in the history of pulp its the original that seems derivative. Neither the writers nor Stanton have done anything to address that problem with the inevitable result that our eyes glaze over when the action heats up. A century ago Burroughss imaginative brand of silliness was unique; now when silliness abounds its just trite. Our slumbering interest does get ramped up at the finale although no thanks to Kitsch whose inflections remain as flat as ever. Then again perhaps we shouldnt slight him because here at last the symmetry is perfect. His John Carter does what John Carter is - its an epic delivered in a monotone.

In theaters on March 12 2012. Photo Credit Frank Connor/ Disney advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A Civil War veteran transported to Mars finds himself fighting yet another battle. BOTTOM LINE Certainly no classic but an enjoyable throwback to the campy fantasy-flicks of yore. CAST Taylor Kitsch Lynn Collins Willem Dafoe Dominic West. LENGTH 217 There is interplanetary travel in the fantasy-epic ""John Carter"" but the movie itself is a time warp. Though based on a 1917 novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs and made with a 2012 budget it feels like an endearingly hokey production from the 1960s with actors traipsing across soundstages and delivering lines like ""I claim the right of challenge"" Thats not entirely a bad thing. ""John Carter"" is directed with such boyish enthusiasm and unabashed nerdism by Pixars Andrew Stanton (""WALL-E"") that its campier moments almost work in its favor. Though messy and overlong its an enjoyable throwback to the movie spectacles of a more innocent age. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Instead of Tony Curtis in ""Spartacus"" we have Taylor Kitsch (NBCs ""Friday Night Lights"") as John Carter a Confederate cavalryman mysteriously transported to Mars (and quickly strapped into a sexy barbarian chest harness). And instead of Raquel Welch in ""One Million Years B.C."" we have Lynn Collins (HBOs ""True Blood"") as Dejah Thoris a heavenly-bodied princess. The various Martian creatures are animated not with stop-motion but motion-capture including Tars Tarkas a towering tusked Thark with four limbs and the still-recognizable voice of Willem Dafoe. The script co-written by haute-pulp novelist Michael Chabon makes no apologies for sticking to cliches. Carter now superhumanly strong thanks to Mars low gravity crosses swords with despot Sab Than (Dominic West) swashbuckles his way across a Martian Jolly Roger and even crashes into a church to stop a wedding. As if that werent enough the entire yarn is framed in a mystery set in 1881 Manhattan. All this pingponging around can get tiresome but Kitsch and Collins have just enough chemistry to get by and Stanton is clearly having a blast. The films 3-D conversion looks great too though ""John Carter"" almost makes you long for a pair of those cardboard blue-green glasses.

Budgeted at a reported 250 million this dreary slog of a mess (or is that mess of a slog?) seems to exist primarily to remind viewers of older better movies. Audiences ancient enough to remember Ray Harryhausen will pine for the days of that animators great 1950s stop-motion epics. Anyone who came of age with ""Star Wars"" will inwardly sigh and forgive Jar Jar Binks. Heck compared with ""John Carter"" even ""Cowboys and Aliens"" looks good. Whats ""John Carter"" about? Thats not a rhetorical question Seriously what the heck is going on in this movie? Based on Edgar Rice Burroughss story ""A Princess of Mars"" this adaptation gets off to such an incoherent start that it takes almost the entire interminable two-hour-plus running time to catch up. And the trip isnt worth it Narratively stilted visually ugly and imaginatively bankrupt ""John Carter"" just sits there and sits there and sits there forcing the audience to sit right along with it. But okay if its a synopsis you want ""John Carter"" is nominally about a Civil War veteran who while searching for gold in the Arizona territory happens upon a dingus that transports him to Mars which the natives call Barsoom where he can jump really high and is taken prisoner by tall skinny four-armed creatures and meets a beautiful princess named Dejah Thoris. Carter is played by Taylor Kitsch (""Friday Night Lights"") who spends a great deal of time with his shirt off; Dejah is played by the gorgeous actress Lynn Collins who spends a great deal of time showing off her tattoos and tossing smoldering looks at Carter with her ice-blue eyes. At least that seems to be whats going on in ""John Carter"" which was adapted for 3-D presentation after it was filmed resulting in images as murky and difficult to decipher as the story itself. Directed by Andrew Stanton (""WALL-E"" ""Finding Nemo"") in his live-action debut whats supposed to be a fanciful journey in time and space is unforgivably awful-looking from the fusty dusty earth tones of the story that frames most of the action to the sulfurous light that bathes Mars - er Barsoom - in a monotonous yellow haze. The creatures that Carter befriends - a rebellious tall-and-skinny (known as a Thark) named Sola and a doglike pet with an enormous black tongue - look like they were conceived after consulting the wadded up sketches in George Lucass wastebasket. If you look carefully you can detect some real acting going on in ""John Carter"" - thats Ciaran Hinds dressed in a ridiculous toga as the embattled leader of the Barsoomian city of Helium. And thats Mark Strong in the films most potent role of a shape-shifting baddie named Matai Shang. But even Strongs best efforts cant save ""John Carter"" from collapsing in on itself like a dead star. With any luck the sequel this movie so strenuously sets us up for will meet the same fate before it gets to the screen.Contains intense sequences of violence and action.

"John Carter | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; john-carter ) John Carter (United States 2012) March 08 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli With its derivative story elements epic scope and straightforward action orientation John Carter is a throwback to a simpler time when it was enough to have a heroic protagonist face off against all manner of monsters and bad guys. The special effects are first-rate but thats no longer enough. The story loosely adapted from the pulp stories of Edgar Rice Burroughs as filtered through the likes of Star Wars and Avatar (which in and of themselves were inspired by the Burroughs series) suffers from a convoluted plot and an anticlimactic resolution but hits enough high notes along the way to be enjoyable. Back in my pre-teen years I collected comic books. I can recall summer mornings spent lying in bed enraptured by the graphic adventures of Conan the Barbarian. John Carter is one of those rare movies that during its watching delivers the same sense of adventure. Theres little doubt this is a flawed motion picture but it aims big and more often than not delivers what it intends. Like its source material which has reached the ripe old age of 100 this year (A Princess of Mars in which Carter makes his first appearance first came to the publics notice in 1912) John Carter is about handsome men beautiful women bizarre aliens and impossible acts of heroism. Its about good triumphing over evil. And if the ending seems a little haphazard because there are more stories to tell at least it has an ending viewers can live with if a sequel never materializes. We are not held hostage to a dubious box office potential. John Carter is an origin story. It relates how the title character (Taylor Kitsch) a post-Civil War confederate captain from Virginia is transported to Mars (called ""Barsoom"" by those who live there). Differences in gravity give Carter enhanced strength and agility on the Red Planet which is in the midst of its own civil war. Carters initial encounter with the natives is with a party of four-armed green-skinned horned Tharks led by Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe). Circumstances lead to his rescue of Princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins) who is to be married by her father Tardos Mors (Ciaran Hinds) to warlord Sab Than (Dominic West) to secure peace between the ""blue"" humanoids and the ""red"" ones. Dejah Thoris wants Carter to join her people in their struggle against the forces of Sab Than; in return she offers him the secret of how to return to Earth. Things are not as simple as they seem however. Than is being controlled by a race of immortal creatures whose entertainment comes from manipulating the rise and fall of empires and planets. To save Mars Carter must form alliances and defeat the plans of Matai Shang (Mark Strong). John Carter is fast-paced - almost too fast-paced. Theres a surfeit of story for its 132-minute running time and in order to cram in everything the backstory is related with an unseemly rapidity and the politics of Mars become a muddle. It doesnt take long to figure out who the good guys are but its not always clear why they are the good guys. Calling John Carter ""science fiction"" is a misnomer; its really ""fantasy"" or ""space opera."" Just because it happens on another planet doesnt mean its ""science fiction."" Middle Earth is no less alien than Barsoom. It helps with the suspension of disbelief if you dont try to figure out why there are so many sword fights in a movie with giant airships. Hey Star Wars had lightsabers This is director Andrew Stantons first live action feature; he comes to John Carter with a Pixar-saturated resume that includes Finding Nemo and WALLE. The movie relies heavily on computer generated elements and resembles the Star Wars prequels in the degree to which special effects are incorporated. It looks impressive in a CGI way with lots of stuff going on in both the foreground and the background. One could make a convincing case that its not much of a leap from WALLE to John Carter. Here a few humans have been added to what amounts to a predominantly animated world. Even the Tharks are the product of motion capture. The acting is adequate for this type of epic with the actors not necessarily having been chosen for their traditional thespian qualities. The most obvious example is Taylor Kitsch who cuts a nice figure without his shirt and delivers his dialogue without stumbling over his lines (although his John Wayne accent early in the proceedings is distracting). He lacks the musculature of Frank Frazettas recognizable interpretation of Carter but he looks the part of an action hero. Lynn Collins brings strength and beauty to the role of Dejah Thoris and she and Kitsch make a good couple. Supporting roles are filled by more established character actors. Mark Strong and Dominic West don the black hats. Ciaran Hinds in Dejah Thoris father the leader of the city Helium. And Willem Dafoe Thomas Hayden Church and Samantha Morton provide the voices (and presumably the motion capture work) for the three main Tharks. The biggest flaw associated with John Carter has nothing to do with the production and everything to do with the presentation. The post-production 3-D conversion is abysmal. Its among the five most inexcusably bad examples of this process and has the potential to destroy the viewing experience for anyone unfortunate to watch it this way. Blurry images dimly lit scenes and view-master quality planar placement abound. Often with 3-D films the 3-D is merely unnecessary. In this case its an impediment to immersion. Its not Clash of the Titans bad but its in the ballpark. Disneys decision to move up the release date from a crowded summer marketplace to the more sedate month of March may help the movies box office performance although it would be surprising to see John Carter generate the revenue necessary to compel a sequel. After all the mis-steps and mis-starts along the way its almost a miracle this movie made it to the screen. Rice Burroughs most famous creation Tarzan has inspired dozens of movies; this is John Carters first trip to the big screen.

Its tedious even during its frantic action scenes many of which also involve computer-generation and performance-capture technology.The characters are one-dimensional even in 3-D which is gimmicky and unnecessary here. Taylor Kitsch does his best with the lackluster Carter character but his acting was more impressive as a teenage football star on TVs Friday NightLights.STORY How Taylor Kitsch became John CarterVIDEO The cast talks John CarterMORE John Carter unveils astronomys vanished view of MarsA former Civil War soldier Carter stumbles upon a cave with gold deposits while being chased by Apaches in Arizona.

Theres a gangly Jar Jar Binks quality to these aliens who are tough to tell apart.

His flying leaps are a result of the change in gravity and he uses that ability to get out of life-threatening jams.John Carter L.A. premiereThe action switches awkwardly to a political skirmish that mostly involves the Red Martian Princess Dejah (Lynn Collins) and her father the King of Helium (Ciaran Hinds) who has agreed to marry her off to the treacherous Sab Than (Dominic West). One of the screenwriters is Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Michael Chabon (The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier amp; Clay) but his literary talents are not visible. Theres a sword-and sandals-feel to the film even on Mars where there should be a sense of wonder. When Carter finds himself able to bound skyward director Stanton shows him repeatedly struggling to stay on the ground stumbling in near-flight. There is little sense of the bewilderment and fascination that would accompany navigating that strange terrain.The villains are overwrought and the design of Mars is surprisingly bland. It doesnt say much for the production design -- or the arc of this lackluster tale -- when the well-chiseled abs of the lead actor and his romantic interest are the most awe-inducing elements.

"John Carter starring Taylor Kitsch reviewed Slate Sign In Sign Up John Carter Theres a Loveable Space Opera Hiding in This Bloated Blockbuster. John Carter Theres a Loveable Space Opera Hiding in This Bloated Blockbuster. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.March 8 2012 757 PM Riggins and Aliens Taylor Kitsch stars in the space Western John Carter. By Dana Stevens Still from John Carter Frank Connor/Disney. Also in Slate Bryan Curtis asks if John Carter can make Mars cool again. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Andrew Stantons John Carter (Disney) comes into theaters trailing a cartload of production-history baggage. This would-be tentpole action picture--a retro-sci-fi fantasy based on a 1917 novel by Tarzan author Edgar Rice Burroughs--has bounced between studios and from one big-name director to another until finally Disney bought the rights and gave it to Stanton (best known for his animation work at Pixar including Wall-E and Finding Nemo). The result is a strange at times misshapen but somehow lovable thing a movie that keeps trying to be smaller and simpler than its 250 million special-effects budget will permit. Buried within this bloated CGI-crammed unnecessarily 3D-ified monster is a bare-bones space western the movie that last years Cowboys and Aliens should have been. And though that smaller movie within the movie isnt allowed to surface often enough what we do see of it is sufficiently winning that we keep waiting around looking forward to its next appearance. John Carter starts off unpromisingly with not one but two overlong frame-story setups. The first involves a singularly unthrilling Martian air battle between two bird-like supercrafts manned by soldiers in armor reminiscent of ancient Rome or at least movies about it. The second and more interesting framing device takes us to New York City in 1881 where the young wide-eyed Edgar Rice Burroughs (played by Daryl Sabara) unexpectedly inherits the vast estate of his late uncle the eccentric amateur archeologist John Carter. Going through Carters papers Burroughs discovers a journal that begins by warning the reader (in slightly more formal Victorian language) to prepare to have his mind blown. Advertisement Its not till then in a flashback that we finally meet John Carter and the movie snaps to attention. Or maybe that was just all the straight women and gay men in the theater snapping to attention since Carter is played by Taylor Kitsch the blunt-featured compactly buff curiously irresistible actor who played the high-school football star Tim Riggins in Friday Night Lights. Carter is a Confederate Civil War veteran whos now making a living prospecting gold in the American West. Hes tough (as we learn in a redundant series of fight scenes) and stubborn (as proven by his refusal to enlist in the Apache-fighting cavalry at the behest of an insistent colonel played by Bryan Cranston). This review would quickly get as overstuffed as the movie if I took the time to explain how Carter gets from a prison cell in the Arizona Territory to the surface of Mars (he finds a magic medallion that transports him there through a space wormhole OK?). But once he arrives on that planets mysteriously oxygen-rich surface the movie achieves its maximum buoyancy-- as does Carter who learns to harness the gravity of Mars to become an expert leaper. This middle section in which both Carter and the audience get a crash course in the politics history and theology of the Red Planet is the movie at its most imaginative and most fun. Carter is first taken in by the Tharks a race of six-limbed reptilian beings who are dissuaded from killing him by their wise leader Tars Tarkas (voiced by Willem Dafoe). Carter soon learns that Mars (known to its inhabitants as Barsoom) also hosts two humanoid populations who are at war with each other for control of the planet. The two city-states are named wonderfully Helium and Zodanga; the princess of Helium Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins) is engaged to the prince of Zodanga Sab Than (Dominic West) but desperate to avoid this forced marriage shes run away to seek help in defeating the evil Zodangans. All this Burroughsian lingo washes pleasantly over the viewers ears; you dont need to get exactly what the Holy Therns are (some sort of order of shape-shifting immortal priests) to know that its cool when a baldheaded Mark Strong appears out of nowhere in flowing gray robes to expound on Martian cosmology. At its best John Carter resembles the kind of movie Raiders of the Lost Ark was made to pay homage to a rollicking pleasantly predictable Saturday-afternoon serial. And the fantastical creatures of Mars--the green-skinned 15-foot-tall Tharks the massive albino apes who take Carter on in gladiatorial combat and a sort of chubby half-dog half-dinosaur that Carter adopts as a pet--are appealingly old-fashioned like a digitally enhanced version of the stop-motion monsters Ray Harryhausen fashioned for movies like Jason and the Argonauts. The films last third overestimates the viewers patience for extended battle scenes grand CGI-augmented processions and pseudoscientific mumbo-jumbo. But its to the credit of the screenwriters (Stanton Mark Andrews and the fantasy-friendly novelist Michael Chabon) that underneath the layers of cheese is a strangely believable romance between the taciturn earthling John Carter and the fiery Martian princess Dejah. Collins a Cate Blanchett lookalike who made a memorable Portia in 2004s The Merchant of Venice has a serene poised presence even in the goofy midriff-baring costumes shes forced to wear; like Carrie Fishers Princess Leia her Dejah is a worthy warrior and ally not just interstellar arm candy. And Taylor Kitsch may not have the broadest range as an actor but theres something endearingly sincere about his performance. He takes his job as an action hero seriously and never hints that hes ironically slumming even when emerging from the innards of a giant ape drenched in royal-blue blood. I only wish John Carter had had the courage of its convictions and not tried to be all things to all demographics. At heart this is a niche movie for lovers of literary science fiction; its clear that Stantons intention was to create a rich internally coherent fantasy universe the way Peter Jackson did in the Lord of The Rings films or George Lucas did in the first Star Wars trilogy. The film should also have kept the working title that it shyly reveals only before the final credits John Carter of Mars. Its that unexpected juxtaposition--the ordinary guy who finds his inner hero when he wakes up on the wrong planet--that lends this overlong but sweet-spirited movie its charm.

Transplanted to Mars a Civil War vet discovers a lush planet inhabited by 12-foot tall barbarians. Finding himself a prisoner of these creatures he escapes only to encounter a princess who is in desperate need of a savior. Video courtesy of Disney/Pixar. By Joe Morgenstern March 8 2012 547 p.m. ET ""John Carter"" delivers one of its precious few delights shortly after the hero a Civil War veteran from Virginia finds himself teleported to Mars. (Actually hes been telegraphed as he was in the widely beloved novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs.) Because of the planets lower gravity John is able to traverse its arid surface in mighty leaps and bounds. Yet his excitement like ours is short-lived for the movies pervasive problem is too much gravity not too little. A deadly heaviness brings Disneys would-be epic down. ENLARGE Pictured here a Martian and Taylor Kitsch (hes the one on the right) in John Carter. Walt Disney Pictures/Everett Collection That is not only saddening but mysterious. The director Andrew Stanton has given immeasurable pleasure to this planets audiences through a series of Pixar features he either directed (""WALLE"" ""Finding Nemo)"" co-directed (""A Bugs Life"") or co-wrote (those three plus ""Monsters Inc."" and the ""Toy Story"" trilogy.) All of them were animated to be sure while ""John Carter"" is live-action at least in part--the majority of the Martian creatures sweeping vistas and elaborate battles were born of bits and bytes. Still it seemed reasonable to believe that Mr. Stantons gifts in one filmmaking mode would transfer smoothly to another just as Disneys executives must have hoped that he would favor their studio with his Midas touch. (Another animation luminary Brad Bird recently directed the new ""Mission Impossible"" with great success though he had a lively script and in Tom Cruise a certified star.) Soon after ""John Carter"" starting shooting though the production was beset by poisonous buzz from pop-culture ghouls who take pleasure in predicting disaster. They noted the swelling budget which had reached a quarter-billion dollars or more and a marketing decision that changed the original title ""John Carter of Mars""--four words charged with genuine resonance--to two words with all the fizz of a low-rent fashion label. This time alas the ghouls were pretty much right. The best to be said of the weirdly inert spectacle is that the vistas are attractive in a muted way (yes Mars is red and Mars is dry but prettier colors wouldnt have constituted a crime against astronomy); the flying machines strike a nice balance between giant dragonflies and the paintings of Bruce McCall; and the battles are impressive in a routine way though it makes no sense that the heros gift for jumping should give him the power to fight his way through vast throngs of bloodthirsty adversaries. Those Martians who are green and obviously alien--theyre four-armed savages called Tharks--look like refugees from ""Avatar"" minus the Navis sexiness grace and clarity of purpose. The Tharks battles with one another and with warring clans of humanoid Martians from the cities of Helium and Zodanga are tedious interludes--four-armed is forewarned--in a narrative thats merely confusing at first when youre still interested in whos doing what to whom but eventually disjointed to the point of incoherence. (I chose to see the film in a 2-D version though its also being shown in retrofitted 3-D.) John Carter himself is less an advertisement for earthly passion than a constant reminder of how desperately the production needed a star in a title role; the buff and handsome Taylor Kitsch gives a flat performance of snoozifying earnestness. Fugitive feelings do surface during quiet moments between John and the beautiful Heliumite princess Dejah Thoris with whom he falls in love and then joins forces to save her dying planet. (Shes played attractively and nearly convincingly by Lynn Collins.) Most of the time though neither the two leads nor a supporting cast that includes Mark Strong and Dominic West seem to be having any fun. Its as if ""John Carter"" were a fire pit with plenty of kindling and logs but no one could find a match. So whats the source of this baffling failure? Does it lie in the size of the budget? Not likely Pixars peerless entertainments have hardly come cheap. Or the difference between live action and the computer process that Pixar pioneered then raised to the level of dramatic art? Thats surely part of it--an animation director inexperienced at getting the best or avoiding the worst from the indifferent cast hes been given to work with. But it doesnt explain the emotional disconnections in the production or in the script which Mr. Stanton wrote with Mark Andrews a Pixar stalwart and Michael Chabon whose novel ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier amp; Clay"" just about defined the glories of American comic strips. Not only is there a lack of chemistry between John Carter and his Martian princess but between Carter and Woola the lumpy unfunny creature who eagerly follows him wherever he goes; this in a movie directed by the man who created exquisite love scenes between a life-detector robot and a garbage compactor. Nor does it address--to move away from Mr. Stanton the field marshal of a small army--the deficits of production design and computer imagery or explain why the score by the usually brilliant Michael Giacchino should be so undistinguished to put it mildly. If I wanted to hazard a guess--nothing but a guess based on whats up there on the screen--Id say that corporate culture was a significant culprit. Pixar the matrix of the filmmakers prior triumphs has been notable for its stable management and for a collegial atmosphere in which warm support combines with brutally honest exchanges of ideas. In recent years Disney the show-business behemoth that now owns Pixar has been riven by managerial upheavals and has never been accused of collegiality. This new Disney film marked by myriad lapses and marketing follies bears the woefully familiar earmarks of a big studio production that was pulled and hauled every which way until it lost all shape and flavor. Thats not to say pure art fell victim to vile commerce--only that ""John Carter"" looks like it went through an unearthly version of the internecine warfare on Mars. Footnote Watch a clip of ""Footnote"". Eliezer and Uriel Shkolnik are father and son as well as rival professors in Talmudic Studies. When both men learn that Eliezer will be lauded for his work their complicated relationship reaches a new peak. Video courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics. The subtext of ""Footnote"" is savagery--not that of Martian Tharks but of rival Talmudic scholars in Israels Hebrew University. The text not so simply is text--the Talmud in its manifold historical versions. Joseph Cedars wise and playful comedy of intellectual manners in subtitled Hebrew could be called ""Almost All in the Family"" since it focuses on a rivalry between father and son. Eliezer Shkolnik played with wonderfully grave demeanor by Shlomo Bar Aba is a senior lecturer with a reputation for meticulous research but the fruits of his lifelong labors are bitter; instead of receiving the Israel Prize his nations top honor for scholarship he has become a mere footnote in other scholars books. Uriel Shkolnik (Lior Ashkenazi) Eliezers middle-aging son may be a glib popularizer by comparison to his pop but he doesnt lack for the adulation that Eliezer craves. Instead of a chip off the old block hes the most proximate reason for a permanent chip on the old mans shoulder. ENLARGE Lior Ashkenazi and Shlomo Bar Aba in Footnote. Sony Pictures Classics All of this might have been no more than the basis of a rich character study but the writer-director Mr. Cedar has devised an intricate ironic plot thats set in motion by a thunderclap call to Eliezers cellphone The Israel Prize has finally come his way. I wont reveal any of the delicious complications that ensue or discuss the slightly surreal climax but one of the best scenes intensely serious yet delicately flavored with Marx Brothers lunacy involves a hurriedly arranged convocation of six men and one nervous woman in a Ministry of Education office big enough for three. And ""Footnote"" does function as a character study an exceptionally rich one. The more we learn about Eliezer who walks with a forbidding forward tilt and dispenses approval to no one the more we understand Uriels anxious need for acclaim. A mere footnote the father may be but hes written a life script for the son. Friends With Kids A decade ago Jennifer Westfeldt starred in a fine independent feature ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" which she wrote with Heather Juergensen. It was a dating-game comedy with a twist. Lovelorn Jessica turned off by the dreary men she meets replies impulsively to a personals ad in the women-seeking-women section. Her decision leads to a lesbian affair thats as charming as it is complicated. Now Ms. Westfeldt has written and directed a straight comedy with herself in another starring role. Once again theres a twist but no charm at all. Watch a clip of ""Friends With Kids"". Two best friends decide to have a child together while keeping their relationship platonic so they can avoid the toll kids can take on romantic relationships. Video courtesy of Roadside Attractions. She plays Julie whose biological clock has developed a stentorian tick. Instead of marrying Julie enters into a pact with a lifelong friend Jason (Adam Scott). Theyll have a baby then share custody while continuing to date other people. Its the perfect solution the anticouple agrees to procreating while still preserving romance in their respective lives. Why they would want to have a baby is another question given the horrors that child-raising brings to the lives of their married friends--domestic quarrels endless encumbrance and soon enough in the case of their own kid serial attacks of explosive diarrhea. Its not a pretty picture in any sense. ""Friends With Kids"" wants to be a broad satire of American mores. (The equipment required for a parents-and-child expedition to a local park is roughly equivalent to what climbers carry forth from base camp on Mount Everest.) But its shrill in tone awash in unexamined narcissism--kids are just pretexts for laughs rather than objects of love--and afflicted by explosive verbal diarrhea. Theres simply no base line of normal human activity let alone intimacy until the anticouple finally re-examines their anticommitment credo. By then everyone has been so selfish and dislikable that our commitment to the film is lost. The cast includes Kristen Wiig Chris ODowd Maya Rudolph Jon Hamm and Megan Fox whose character though marginal manages to outshallow everyone else. DVD Focus The War of the Worlds (1953) Mars invades Earth in this sci-fi classic based on an H.G. Wells novel which George Pal produced in 1953. (The film won an Oscar for special effects.) Watching the march of the Martian machines across our country youre taken in not by the dazzling reality of the visual tricks but by their resourcefulness and charming artificiality. In our digital age when anything is possible movie magic can be daunting or assaultive. Half a century ago special effects were invitations to willing wonderment. That said Steven Spielbergs 2005 remake with Tom Cruise and fancier effects is enjoyable too. Wonder Boys (2000) Michael Chabon wrote the novel that Steve Kloves adapted for Curtis Hanson to direct. Michael Douglas is Grady Tripp once a wonder boy but now a pothead teacher of creative writing. Tobey Maguire is James Leer Gradys best student. He is also an extravagantly gifted liar if not a budding lunatic. The movie set in Pittsburgh starts as a screwball comedy about the professors travails and his students knack for making them worse. Sneakily though and ever so adroitly the film invests Gradys absurdity with humanity and his thwarted hopes with possibilities while tracking his roundabout journey to true love. Bridesmaids (2011) Two of the three leading women in ""Friends With Kids""--Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph--starred in last years comedy hit but Im bringing up the film again because Chris ODowd in an inspired piece of casting was in it too.

Walt Disney Pictures hide caption toggle caption Walt Disney Pictures John Carter Director Andrew Stanton Genre Science Fiction Adventure Running Time 132 minutes Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and actionWith Taylor Kitsch Lynn Collins Samantha Morton Willem Dafoe Watch Clips From John Carter - Virginia Virginia Credit Walt Disney Pictures From John Carter - Barsoom Barsoom Credit Walt Disney Pictures From John Carter - One Who Jumps One Who Jumps Credit Walt Disney Pictures John Carter may seem awfully familiar for a character whod largely fallen out of pop-culture favor by the mid-20th century. The first fictional hero created by Tarzan author Edgar Rice Burroughs Carter is a Civil War veteran accidentally transported from the rocky arid landscape of the Arizona Territory to the similarly dusty surface of Mars. There he finds himself able to leap tall rock outcroppings in a single bound endowed with superstrength thanks to the reduced Martian gravity. But due to the fantastical visual world Burroughs described in his writing Carter became the lesser-known of his creations resisting cinematic adaptations for a century. (Apart from a cheapie 2009 straight-to-video version). To make Tarzan all you needed was a man in a loincloth a chimp and a jungle. For John Carter to live beyond the page a filmmaker would need entire cities built on alien landscapes elaborate airships and 12-foot-tall 6-limbed green Martians known as Tharks. So Burroughs ""Barsoom"" novels (the word the residents of Mars use for their world) remained more influential than widely known -- which is why even if youve never heard of John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) the movie that bears his name may feel like a compilation of science-fiction ideas from the last century. The most recent reference point is Avatar which when you boil the plot down to its essentials -- a man assimilates with an alien race to help save their planet falling in love with a native in the process -- is almost entirely lifted from Burroughs story. Given the visual requirements it makes sense that Disney went with an animation director Andrew Stanton (Wall-E Finding Nemo) to bring the characters and environments of Barsoom to life. The special effects are some of the strongest elements here as Stanton and his digital team convincingly render a wide variety of Martian creatures -- from the tall green tusked Tharks who take Carter prisoner before joining forces with him in a battle against one faction of the more humanoid-looking ""Red"" Martian species -- down to the films primary source of comic relief Woola a blazingly fast creature that looks like a reptilian cross between a toad and a bulldog. All of these characters and the richly detailed backdrops are utterly immersive and lifelike -- even without the completely unnecessary 3-D. Kantos Kan (James Purefoy left) a naval lieutenant of the Red Martians stands with Tardos Mors (Ciaran Hinds) leader of the Martian kingdom Helium. Walt Disney Pictures hide caption toggle caption Walt Disney Pictures Stantons previous work expertly blended a dazzling visual sense and great action sequences with affecting emotion -- who didnt cry during Wall-E? Its on that latter count that John Carter falls a little short. Theres a love story at the center of the movie as Carter falls for the Red Martian princess Dejah (Lynn Collins) a beautiful warrior whos being forced into marriage to save her people. But all the swelling music in the world cant obscure the fact that theres just no spark between the two; Kitsch is a decidedly bland presence in a movie that needs a larger-than-life hero to carry both the romance and the action. A forgettable leading man isnt necessarily a deal-breaker; Sam J. Jones star of the 1980 cult favorite Flash Gordon was hardly an impressive presence but that film based on a character that takes some cues from Burroughs fully embraced the camp of the source material. This story is a similarly pulpy adventure tale but theres a tonal tug of war at work in the film between those leanings and a desire to make this into a more lush serious romantic epic. When Stanton lets the film be pure popcorn entertainment with swashbuckling set pieces and lovably corny romanticism its a great ride in the Indiana Jones tradition. But when John Carter begins taking itself too seriously -- which at an overlong 132 minutes it has plenty of opportunity to do -- its star feels a little lost. At those moments its easy to wish that Kitsch was allowed to play things with a little more well kitsch.

Matt Gillmer Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""John Carter"" the live-action adventure from ""Wall-E"" director Andrew Stanton concludes with a dedication ""to Steve Jobs an inspiration to us all."" Its hard to believe Pixars founder would have signed off on this project. The film is as overcomplicated bloated and crash-prone as a bad-old-days Microsoft release. Begun in Edgar Rice Burroughs 1912 fantasy ""A Princess of Mars"" and running through 30 years of sequels and spinoffs the John Carter saga was long considered the greatest science-fiction movie never made. It still holds that distinction. Stantons adaptation is not a coherent story of interplanetary heroics but a bewildering 250 million mash-up of ""Cleopatra"" ""The Last Samurai"" and ""Attack of the Clones."" It has the form of an adventure but not the spirit. It is relentless -- saloon fights Indians swords beasts death rays -- but tedious. At the end you dont stand up and cheer you sigh in relief. Three narrators three timelines and 20 minutes are required to deliver all the exposition in a prologue setting up John Carters back story and arrival on Mars. Carter (Taylor Kitsch of ""Friday Night Lights"") is a Confederate Civil War veteran turned gold prospector. He is done with war. To prove this point he makes a half-dozen escape attempts from an Evil Army Officer (Bryan Cranston) who wants to force him back into the military. When he succeeds in galloping off he overshoots the mark by about 50 million miles and lands on Mars. How does this happen? Magic is the answer as it is for most of the films strenuous amazements. On low-gravity Mars Carter has the ability to jump around like a coiled spring but the plot jumps around more. The story arc could have emerged from a committee of kangaroos. Having traded one vast desert for another Carter finds himself in the crossfire of a new war. He becomes the slave-pet of the leader of the green-skinned four-armed Tharks. This barbaric race skirmishes against two warring tribes of more civilized humanoids the evil hordes of Zodanga and the good people of Helium. Citizens of Helium do not speak in a high squeaky voice but the film would be more fun if they did. In an additional layer of complication a bald immortal (Mark Strong) appears and vanishes willy-nilly to advise the nefarious Zodangan chief (Dominic West) on strategy. Frank Connor / AP DISNEY Taylor Kitsch in ""John Carter."" Because Heliums Princess Dejah (Lynn Collins) dresses like Slave Leia theres scant suspense about which side Carter will be fighting on. It sure isnt because of the quality of their conversation. Kitsch is handsome and has a warm smile. Collins is pretty and has elegant diction. Together they have no spark. They fall in love not because it feels right but because the film requires it. In place of clearly defined characters streamlined storytelling and rising action we get a barrage of massive inconsequential battle scenes. Stanton has no feel for this sort of spectacle creating a vast alien world with zero sense of wonder. The film only jolts to life in brief comic asides. There is a slapstick scene in which Carter struggles to adjust to Martian gravity a lovable slobbery frog/dog critter that becomes Carters faithful pet and a moment when Carters Thark owner gives him a dope slap for doing something truly boneheaded. A similar thump on the noggin ought to be directed at the people responsible for ""John Carter."" Dont they realize that cowboys and aliens dont mix?

More about John Carter >> Wait until he wakes up on the backside of Mars if he really wants to find hell A desert planet where warring species - green four-armed giants called Tharks the battling humanlike citizens of Helium and Zodanga the Therns the White Apes the toothy Cro-Magnon critters called Warhoons - seem intent on destroying one another and the orb they call home. A lavish but lumbering green-screen adaptation of the first installment in Edgar Rice Burroughs ""Barsoom"" series (The Princess of Mars published 100 years ago) John Carter stars Taylor Kitsch as the Eastwoodian cowboy thrown into an alien world. When he first awakens on Barsoom (what the natives call Mars) the long-haired hero takes a few tentative ""What the . . . ?"" steps and discovers he can leap vast stretches of the rocky terrain. Yes its the gravity of the situation. Director Andrew Stanton director of the Pixar hits Finding Nemo and Wall-E (and working in live-action for the first time) has found an aptly named leading man. John Carter is about as kitsch as you can get although Kitsch manages to keep his scowl in place as a planeload of British thespians decked out in armor and plumage offer mock-Shakespearean pronouncements of animus and portent. For the record the Brits (and Irish) involved in this epically cheesy fantasy include Mark Strong (a power-mad priest named Matai Shang) Dominic West (the Prince of Zodanga) Ciaran Hinds (as Tardos Mors Jeddak of Helium) and James Purefoy (worried captain of a flying gunship). More interesting for Carter whom the Tharks call ""Virginia"" (a running joke derived from the fact he hails from the Southern state) is the Princess of Helium Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins) the bronzed and tattooed royal leading her people in a desperate quest for peace among the disparate parties of Barsoom. It isnt long before Carter and Thoris are side by side swashing buckles against bad guys and exchanging deep looks of desire. John Carter presented in both 3-D and 2-D versions is a sword-and-sandals spectacle infused with retro sci-fi beasts and blarney. It would have made a great Technicolor treat in the 1950s say with stop-motion animation by Ray Harryhausen and a strapping Steve Reeves as the intergalactic Confederate army hero. And thats kind of the aesthetic that Stanton is going for over-the-top pulp. But theres something generic about the digitally rendered Martians (whatever their stripe and skin tone) and theres a corniness to the dialogue that keeps the audience from any kind of emotional attachment to the Tharks and Zodangans and their ilk.

A little respect please. ""John Carter only appears to be a 250 million space turkey named after a chartered accountant. It only seems like the pureed hash of ""Star Wars ""Avatar and every other interplanetary rocket rodeo since the genre was invented.Actually the movies based on the book that invented the genre. Edgar Rice Burroughs debuted ""A Princess of Mars in the pages of the pulp-fiction magazine the All-Story almost exactly a century ago following it up with no less than 10 novels in the ""Barsoom series (Barsoom being his Martians name for their home planet). ""Princess was Burroughss first published work - the ""Tarzan series that sealed his fame came later - and it is a direct influence on everything that ensued ""Flash Gordon Ray Bradburys ""The Martian Chronicles ""Babylon 5 and yes George Lucass and James Camerons little space operas as those directors would be the first to tell you. Astronomer Carl Sagan confessed to being a lifelong fan. ""A Princess of Mars has set a million dreams in motion.So heres the movie version sprung upon a 21st-century public that has long forgotten the source in a pop-culture flood of Saturday afternoon serials comic strips junk TV shows computerized digital effects and fanboy fantasy blogs. (ComicCon wouldnt even exist without Burroughs.) It has been retitled ""John Carter with almost perverse banality and brought to the screen by some surprising worthies director/co-writer Andrew Stanton of Pixar fame (""Finding Nemo ""WALL-E) and co-writer Michael Chabon of literary immortality (although if writing ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier amp; Clay doesnt qualify him for this adventure I dont know what does).And against the odds ""John Carter is itself pretty amazing - an epic pulp saga that slowly rises to the level of its best imitations and wins you over by degrees. I say that as a grown-up moviegoer; behind me at a recent screening was a row of 10-year-old boys who were ecstatically in from the get-go. Thats probably all that matters.If the movie had a leading actor with the galactic charisma necessary for the task we might even be talking classic sci-fi. Since its impossible to put Harrison Ford into the Wayback Machine though were stuck with the unfortunately named Taylor Kitsch (TVs ""Friday Night Lights) as John Carter the burned-out Civil War veteran who finds himself mysteriously transported to the Red Planet while searching for gold in the caves of Arizona. Kitsch is decent company - manly muscled noble sardonic - but theres nothing unique about him and we follow him by default.Also it takes a while to sort out the others. Carter lands amid the Tharks a warrior tribe of tall green four-armed Bugaboos lorded over by the Jeddak or Chieftain Tars Tarkas (voiced by Willem Dafoe). They inhabit the vast wastelands of the now-dry planet but over in the fertile sector the peace-loving humanoids of Helium are having their behinds handed to them by the bellicose humanoids of Zodanga. Sab Than (Dominic West) is the head bad guy and Tardos Mors (Ciaran Hinds) is the leader of Helium; his daughter Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins) is the fetching fighter princess the villain intends to take as his betrothed. Then there are the Holy Therns a group of interstellar meddlers led by Matai Shang (Mark Strong) who has been airlifted in from the third ""Barsoom novel. Theyre backing Sab Than with futuristic weaponry just because they like to see other civilizations go kerplooey.Whats a strapping Earthling to do in this three-way chess game? Bound about like a jumping bean for one thing - the lesser gravity of Mars frees up Carter to perform aerial feats of heroism that stop the Barsoomians in their tracks. Burroughs didnt invent the white mans fantasy of becoming another races Chosen One but he was the first to set it on a different planet. Cameron for one was taking notes.So was everyone else apparently Part of the weirdness of ""John Carter is watching the movie take its own shape out of bits so familiar theyre practically in our collective unconscious. The sniping hero-and-princess schtick the arena battle with the raging alien Tuskodonts the zooming chase scenes in space - all present and accounted for. You can see what was lifted from Burroughs for ""The Princess Bride and even ""Lawrence of Arabia or is it the other way around? Is ""John Carter a pop-culture blueprint or a Xeroxed copy with the toner running low?In the end its immaterial. Crucially Stanton and his team neither mock the genre nor grovel before it. They have the confidence that their story will work (it does) and that its roots are strong enough to sustain our attention for the first or the umpteenth time. ""John Carter is built largely out of digital bits obviously but it feels like it takes place in a real world with majestic Utah locations standing in for the plains of Barsoom. The movie has been given an acceptable post-production 3-D rinse but other than turning the whole thing brown the technologys unnecessary. I stopped noticing the 3-D five minutes in; what Hollywood keeps forgetting is that well do the algorithms in our heads if the movies good.And ""John Carter is good - not great but captivating enough detailed enough Saturday-afternoon-silly enough to bring out the kid in you one more time. Better yet to make it feel like the first time.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2012 Globe Newspaper Company.

(AP Photo/Disney Frank Connor) <<12>> In Theaters This Week Get showtimes watch movie trailers Being Flynn John Carter John Carter 3-D The Forgiveness of Blood Friends With Kids Let the Bullets Fly Salmon Fishing in the Yemen Silent House A Thousand Words Its been 100 years since writer Edgar Rice Burroughs ""Princess of Mars"" was first serialized in a pulp-fiction magazine. Released six years later in book form it was the first in what would become a series of pioneering science-fiction novels about John Carter a former Confederate cavalry officer who finds himself transported to Mars. And almost since ""Princess of Mars"" was first released in print filmmakers have been trying to figure out how to translate Burroughs fantastical world (called Barsoom) into a movie.Six years ago it ended up in the hands of a true fan Andrew Stanton whose writing and directing work at Pixar includes ""Toy Story"" ""Finding Nemo"" and ""WALL-E."" And on Friday Burroughs work -- now called ""John Carter"" -- finally emerges on the big screen loaded with dazzling special effects and in 3-D. The problem is those 100 years that have passed. Burroughs saga was so influential in the development of the sci-fi genre that it inspired not just several generations of writers but also such filmmakers as George Lucas and James Cameron.That leaves Stanton in something of a bind since by being faithful to the source material its almost inevitable that ""John Carter"" comes off as derivative of ""Star Wars"" ""Avatar"" ""Indiana Jones"" and even the original ""Planet of the Apes."" (The language -- leaders called Jeddak a warrior rank of padwar -- has a particular ""Star Wars"" ring to it.) The fact that Burroughs vision of life on Mars long predates those films is not going to register with most moviegoers. And thats too bad because ""John Carter"" has considerable charms and for most of its two-hour-plus running time its a delightful bit of entertainment. Advertisement As in ""Princess of Mars"" Carters story is told through a journal that ends up in the hands of a young writer. In the tale Carter -- who lost his family in the Civil War -- is drawn to the West in search of gold. He discovers the gold but he also stumbles into a cave thats a portal from Earth to Barsoom.The world of Barsoom looks much like the Old West until you notice the ruins dotting the landscape. The planet has been constantly at war for generations and its now come down to a final showdown between two races the Heliumites and Zodangans. Watching from the sidelines a nomadic warrior tribe called the Tharks (think and I hate to say this Jar-Jar Binks with four arms and a really nasty disposition).Into this constant fighting drops Carter who now has semi-superpowers because of the difference in the gravity of Barsoom and Earth. He gets captured by the Thark but eventually wins the trust of the tribe. He becomes enamored of Princess Dejah of Helium who is about to be unwillingly wed to the leader of Zodangans and ends up fighting by her side. Oh and it turns out the whole war on Barsoom is being manipulated by yet another race the Therns who fall somewhere between the Q Continuum of ""Star Trek The Next Generation"" and the Guardians of ""Green Lantern.""As he has demonstrated in the past particularly with ""WALL-E"" Stanton is a born storyteller with a great visual flair. His Barsoom is a marvel seamlessly melding location filming (largely in the badlands of Utah) and computer-generated effects. He uses 3-D technology effectively and with restraint. And he visualizes Burroughs very Victorian vision of life on another planet -- the ""spaceships"" look more like sailing ships than the Starship Enterprise -- in vivid detail.Stanton and co-writers Mark Andrews and Michael Chabon manage to smooth over some of the flaws in Burroughs narrative although they cant quite get away from the overabundance of cliffhangers and decided lack of humor in the original text. (An Indiana Jones style quip now and then would be a welcome relief.) They also smartly make Princess Dejah into a strong presence rather than the damsel in distress she was in Burroughs novel.The film features a good cast starting with Taylor Kitsch -- so memorable as Tim Riggins in ""Friday Night Lights"" and seemingly on his way to a solid film career -- as Carter. Such fine actors as Dominic West Mark Strong Willem Dafoe Thomas Haden Church Bryan Cranston and James Purefoy pop as various Heliumites Zodangans and Tharks. And Lynn Collins (one of the best things about ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"") is terrific as Princess Dejah. She and Kitsch (who also was in ""Wolverine"") have real chemistry and you can see why Carter would want to stay on Barsoom to be with her.As one of several Pixar writer-directors making the jump to live action (Brad Bird got there first with ""Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol"") Stanton shows with ""John Carter"" that he can be just as effective using real actors as he can with robots and talking fish.""John Carter"" may not be a perfect movie but its one where you can safely plunk down your money grab your box of popcorn and come away reasonably satisfied when the closing credits roll.john carter   1/2 Rating PG-13 (for action violence)Cast Taylor Kitsch Lynn Collins Mark Strong and Willem DafoeDirector Andrew StantonRunning time 2 hours 17 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Talend Silicon Valleys latest tech IPO has a strong debutSource Tesla looking at cameras radar in Florida crashCartoons Hillary Clinton makes history Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

See 10 Minutes of John Carter Now (Video) ""Avatar"" and all the other subsequent pillagers of the original Edgar Rice Burroughs story make this big-screen treatment feel redundant Remember when people went crazy for Pinkberry because that whole sweet-and-tangy yogurt thing seemed so new and original? And then it turned out that Pinkberry had borrowed its shtick from Red Mango? And then people tried Red Mango and thought ""Well its good but it tastes just like Pinkberry""? ""Carter"" target=""_blank""gt;John Carter"" is the Red Mango of science fiction. And even though Edgar Rice Burroughs century-old pulp novels influenced everything from ""Avatar"" to ""Star Wars"" to Superman the movie version of those books feels like yogurt youve already tasted. Also read Disneys 250M John Carter Gamble Otherworldly Hit or Cosmic Bomb? We meet embittered Civil War veteran John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) as he is attempting to avoid conscription into the armys fight against the Apaches; Hed rather pursue a cave that hes convinced is filled with treasure. When he finds it all he winds up with is a pendant that accidentally teleports him to Mars (the locals call it Barsoom) where the lighter gravity allows Carter to leap to great heights and long distances. Burroughs story (adapted to the screen by Mark Andrews Michael Chabon and director Andrew Stanton) comes loaded with enough characters and warring tribes to merit the distribution of a glossary at the screening I attended but it all boils down to two warring human-like races (the evil Zodangans want to crush the peace-loving Heliumites) a bunch of manipulative cosmic buttinskys known as Therns and a race of tall be-tusked green folks (the Tharks). Carter of course is fighting the bad guys becoming a hero to the downtrodden and falling in love with the hot princess (Lynn Collins as Deja Thoris). Also read See 10 Minutes of John Carter (Video) Stanton comes to his live-action debut with the acclaimed ""Wall-E"" and ""Finding Nemo"" under his belt but ""John Carter"" lacks the sizzle that his fellow animator Brad Bird brought to ""Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol."" Stantons work here is competent on an epic scale; everything from the performances to the look of the film is perfectly fine but theres a crushing dullness to it. The movie doesnt lack for incident with glider battles or secret chambers or arena fighting popping up on a regular basis but there are almost no surprises to be found. ""Friday Night Lights"" star Kitsch will be appearing in some 45 action movies over the next 12 months and while he in no way embarrasses himself here the role of Carter is such a generic compilation of ""haunted warrior"" and ""reluctant hero"" cliches that its hard for him to do anything to make the character pop. The same goes for Collins -- the brainy sexpot princess she plays became the template for any number of slinky sci-fi heroines so theres not much she can do to make this character feel unique. The performance-capture animation of the Thark characters reminds us that the technology works best on animals and aliens and Willem Dafoes distinctive voice makes chieftain Tars Tarkas into a memorable character. The problem comes in trying to tell the Tharks apart; theyre all tall green and bearing tusks from their face but theyre generally on camera so briefly that its hard to distinguish one from another with the exception of the treacherous Tal Hajus (voiced by Thomas Haden Church) whos missing a tusk. For all its efforts and intentions and despite the occasional minor thrill ""John Carter"" winds up being as generic and forgettable as its title. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

The books offer enough material for several movies which seems to be the root of the problem here the movie is so overloaded with exposition that the situations have little room to develop. Unlike Stantons memorable animation features this is surprisingly devoid of humor or winning characterization though the special effects are fantastic.

Thus the Martian deity Matai Shang (Mark Strong) explains to the visiting Earthman John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) why his race of gods has bent the minds of Martians toward a malicious end. But the prankish shape-shifting Shang might also be referring to the game of otherworldly action-adventure -- the fantasy genre that Edgar Rice Burroughs helped hatch when he began publishing his first Carter story called Under the Moons of Mars in serial form in The All-Story magazine 100 years ago last month. The series was eventually published in book form as A Princess of Mars in 1917 by which time Burroughs had created his more famous displaced hero Tarzan. Andrew Stanton director of the animated enthrallments Finding Nemo and WALLE has finally brought the grandfather of all time- and space-traveling American supermen to pure movie form in John Carter. Oddly excepting a direct-to-video B movie called Princess of Mars in 2009 the Carter tales had never been officially filmed before though not for want of trying. Animation director Robert Clampett started work on a feature version in the early 1930s; and many later worthies including Ray Harryhausen Robert Rodriguez Jon Favreau and several generations of Disney employees have seriously mulled adaptations of the Burroughs stories. Other filmmakers borrowed the central premise and attached different names to the hero. Carter was Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers in 30s serials Luke Skywalker in Star Wars and most explicitly Jake Sully in James Camerons Avatar. Cameron openly cited the John Carter books as a crucial source for his Pandoran rhapsody. As he told Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen ""Ive always had a fondness for those kind of science fiction/adventure stories the male warrior in an exotic alien land overcoming physical challenges and confronting the fears of difference. Do we conquer? Exploit? Integrate? Avatar explores those issues."" Cameron was just the latest pulp poet to manufacture heroic fiction from the American imperialist impulse -- extending from the time of John Smith and Pocahontas (another inspiration for Avatar) and still percolating today -- in which macho adventurers find some exotic land intervene in a tribal war and help the good guys win. (Or as many real U.S. soldiers discovered die trying.) (MORE See Corlisss review of Avatar) Stanton was eager to join his Pixar colleague Brad Bird in the live-action realm. Bird made the recent Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol but the John Carter film has a much higher degree of difficulty and risk of failure. The Disney production arrives in theaters with a long production history (it was written in 2007-09 filmed in 2010 and tinkered with ever since) a high price tag (at least a quarter-billion dollars) and the threatening rumor of stinkerdom. Not quite the ""large dollop of oatmealy sick persons poop"" that Jaime N. Christley proclaimed it in his Slant review the movie is certainly a mess of pottage an occasionally savory hodgepodge of variations on a reheated theme. On the plus side Stanton works chromatic wonders with Mars mandatory burnt-sienna landscape and he frames shots with a nice notion of visual suspense hinting at something foreboding just outside our line of vision. The film also offers a Pixarian comic lift in the planets doglike species the calot. Like Carter who is able to leap vast spaces in the lighter gravity of of Mars -- or as Burroughs renamed it Barsoom -- his calot Woola gives the picture an essential dose of buoyancy. Too often though John Carter and his story lumber as if tethered to the ground by heavier density. For all its flying machines which navigate the air like magical pterodactyl skeletons on a crazy chase-race the movie has trouble soaring. (MORE See which Pixar movies are on our 25 Best Animated Films of All-TIME list) Stanton and his screenwriting partners -- Mark Andrews (the director of this summers Pixar film Brave) and the Pulitzer-winning novelist Michael Chabon -- stayed faithful to the Burroughs original despite its having been deeply plundered less than three years ago in the highest-grossing film of all time. Again we meet a soldier from Earth who travels to a distant planet romances an alien princess (here Lynn Collinss Dejah Thoris) and befriends an oversize race the four-armed Tharks who look like Camerons Navi though unfortunately crossbred with that Gungan galoot Jar Jar Binks. The result is that John Carter plays like an alternate inferior version of Avatar... ...Plus fleeting hints of John Fords The Searchers -- for this is also a Western. Set (like The Searchers) in 1868 it relates the long journey of a grizzled Civil War veteran haunted by the deaths of the woman and child he loved. (Kitsch speaks in the gruff vocal register of The Searchers star John Wayne.) Beginning with a framing story that connects Carter to a fictional Edgar Rice Burroughs then taking ages to get from an Arizona saloon to the Martian desert -- from barroom to Barsoom -- the movie tasks the lone cowboy with settling a dispute among the Red Planets three warring groups Burroughs equivalent of the Indians (the Tharks) the settlers (Princess Dejahs subjects in the city of Helium) and the marauding gunslingers (the warriors of Zodanga). The plot as you can tell is complicated but its rarely involving. The one genuinely warm relationship is between the Thark lord Tars Tarkas (voiced by Willem Dafoe) and his rebel daughter Sola (Samantha Morton). (MORE Find Avatar on our Top 10 Movies of the 2000s) Proceeding in fits and starts and flats and stops John Carter has some zesty set pieces but no rooting interest. Kitsch the football hero from Friday Night Lights plays Carter as 200 pounds of surly beefcake. And despite valiant efforts by Collins (the True Blood alumna who appeared with Kitsch in X-Men Origins Wolverine) the two romantic leads strike no sparks except for those of comrade-warriors. Michael Giacchinos sumptuous score swells as Carter finally renounces his terrestrial bonds to become one with his Helium princess -- at the end the movie renames itself John Carter of Mars -- but the moment lacks agony or ecstasy. It strains for an emotion it hasnt earned. For all its incidental pleasures John Carter could use what the best Pixar movies possess a strong original story and characters who attach themselves to moviegoers hearts instead of simply passing across their field of vision. The film could have been a triumph or even more endearing a wild folly on the order of David Lynchs mad science-fiction epic Dune. But it neither transcends nor subverts the genre that Burroughs more or less invented. Im glad Stanton made John Carter; I just dont know why he did.

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday March 8 2012 1200 PM Title John Carter Since any ""John Carter"" review has to name-check about a dozen characters artists or works this 100-year-old story has inspired a list sung to Billy Joels ""We Didnt Start the Fire"" should do the job Buck Rogers Flash Gordon Duck Dodgers Superman. Arthur Clarke and Bradbury and ""Planet of the Apes."" Rod Serling Spock and Kirk Green Lantern Han and Luke. ""Avatar"" Spielberg ""The Cat From Outer Space."" Okay thats enough. Geeks can now go back to the fantasy novels of ""Tarzan"" author Edgar Rice Burroughs that spawned all this. Everyone else may be surprised to learn that what director Andrew Stanton has brought forth from Burroughs limited hoary source material is actually kind of fun. RELATED JOHN CARTER WAS 100 YEARS IN THE MAKING RELATED TAYLOR KITSCH GOT PHYSICAL FOR ROLE Not that it doesnt come with serious leaps of faith. But while ""John Carter"" is undeniably silly sprawling and easy to make fun of its also playful genuinely epic and absolutely comfortable being what it is. In this genre those are virtues as rare as a cave of gold. Thats the bounty that native Virginian J.C. (Taylor Kitsch) is seeking in post-Civil War Arizona when he finds an alien and a magic amulet. That amulet zooms him to the planet Barsoom -- thats Mars to us -- where despite his lowly outsider status Carter proves invaluable to a tusked tribe of huge four-armed creatures and their gruff leader Tars (voiced by Willem Dafoe). Thats because on Barsoom Carters bone density allows him to leap like a flying squirrel. Plus as a fighter hes undeterred by gigantic ""white apes"" and a tyrannical flying city. And while he hates taking sides he helps an oppressed Martian people and their beautiful princess (Lynn Collins). Theres little here that hasnt been seen before which to some people is sorta the point. Stanton a co-founder of Pixar and director of the unassailable ""Wall-E"" lets ""John Carter"" wear its heart on its loincloth and he never lets the often clunky-looking effects -- essentially theyre ""Dune"" done well -- overwhelm the humans. Those humans though do feel like they were cast from the backlot of a miniseries set in Rome. The aptly named Kitsch is never dull and lunkheaded like similar movie warriors Sam Worthington and Jason Momoa but neither does his sinewy grunge look mix with the late-19th-century earthly story or the sandy alien landscapes. Collins if not quite the kind of pulp-fantasy babe that graced the covers of Burroughs source books -- beginning with ""A Princess of Mars"" -- in the 70s has a steely swagger and avoids looking dumb in the Angelina Jolie-type tattoos that are the Martians natural markings. Skulking on the sidelines are Ciaran Hinds Dominic West and Mark Strong whose big religioso powers and bald head are sci-fi staples. The most memorable performance is from Dafoe whose motion-capture turn is vibrant heartfelt and bigger-than-life -- targets ""John Carter"" orbits but only occasionally hits.

Share Tweet In 1912 a struggling businessman named Edgar Rice Burroughs--who at age 35 had already worked as a rancher soldier and pencil-sharpener wholesaler--published his first story. Titled ""Under The Moons Of Mars"" and credited to ""Norman Bean"" it introduced the character of John Carter an ex-Confederate soldier transported from the American Southwest to Mars where red-skinned humans; 15-foot-high six-legged green-skinned warriors; and other races vie to control the remains of a once-vibrant planet. That same year Burroughs published Tarzan Of The Apes the story of an Englishman raised in the jungle. Both characters have had long lives and developed considerable followings though ones fame has outstripped the other. A hero reinvented anew for each generation--with varying degrees of success--Tarzan has starred in films comic strips radio series parodies and a feature-length animated Disney movie. Though less of a pop-culture touchstone John Carter and the 11 Burroughs novels set on Mars--or to use the preferred Martian term Barsoom--exerted even more influence than Burroughs Tarzan books by combining swashbuckling Old West heroics and a wildly imaginative take on alien life into a series of irresistible adventures. Anyone whos enjoyed a science-fiction tale that relied more on daring action and conflicts between good and evil than on calculating the amount of fuel needed to escape the gravitational pull of a planets atmosphere has in no small part Burroughs Barsoom stories to thank. Yet in spite of its influence on everything from Flash Gordon to Star Wars to Avatar Barsoom has remained largely confined to the pages of Burroughs books. Thats partly because technological limitations have made it difficult to realize Burroughs vision of Mars. Looney Tunes animator Bob Clampett gave it a shot in the 1930s but the project never got off the ground. Neither did John Carter films from Ray Harryhausen Robert Rodriguez and others who all possibly lucked out by not getting the job. A hundred years of anticipation builds up a lot of pressure. Not that its the only element contributing pressure. Given that bringing Carter to the big screen involves convincingly creating a whole planet with deep roots in early-20th-century pulp fiction its a difficult project under any circumstances. (Its also worth noting that a truly faithful adaptation would be directed by Paul Verhoeven rated NC-17 and filled with the copious nudity and generous bloodletting of Burroughs original stories.) Andrew Stanton--the Pixar vet behind Finding Nemo and Wall-E--remains relatively true to Burroughs vision with John Carter which is occasionally to the films detriment especially in the early going. The opening scene however spectacular-looking plays like a non-fans nightmare of what science fiction is like. Airships confront each other against the Martian frontier. Armor-clad men spout dialogue referring to civilizations and technologies that people whove never read Burroughs wont understand and those who havent read him recently might not recall. Eerie-looking bald men appear out of thin air. Its almost as if someone dropped the wrong reel into the projector first. What follows doesnt improve matters much. Viewers meet John Carter (Friday Night Lights Taylor Kitsch) as he evades a shady character in 19th-century New York then learn of his death as his nephew Edgar Burroughs (Spy Kids veteran Daryl Sabara) assumes control of his sizable estate and begins reading the journal his uncle left behind. (The film keeps the conceit of Burroughs books that the author is sharing a true story recounted by Carter himself.) From there the film flashes back to Carters experiences as a Southwestern prospector and his subsequent reluctant enlistment into a confrontation between the local cavalry (led by Bryan Cranston) and a tribe of Apaches. He accidentally gets a chance to sidestep the fighting however after stumbling into a cave and ending up on Mars. He initially thinks himself still in the American desert in one of the films cleverest touches but the mistaken impression doesnt last much longer than it takes to stumble on an incubator filled with just-hatched six-legged green babies and encounter a towering green Martian warrior named Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe). From there Stanton starts to explore carefully the world we encountered so breathlessly in the opening scene. Carter is imprisoned by the Tharks--those green Martians--then becomes a member of their uncompromising nomadic society. Eventually he learns of the human red Martians and meets their beautiful princess Dejah Thoris (played by Lynn Collins with all the stately assurance her navel-baring costumes will allow). Its a world Burroughs would have recognized. Though created by state-of-the-art CGI effects all the dog-like frog-monsters and old-fashioned swordplay of Burroughs Barsoom makes it to the screen. His breathless momentum on the other hand doesnt at least not immediately. Stantons film in the opening half lacks the efficient storytelling of his animated features. We learn about Tharks but not nearly enough to make a late-film revelation of one characters parentage as meaningful as the dramatic gravity around the moment suggests it ought to be. Other Burroughs-isms like the advanced particle beam that could save Martian civilization (or... destroy it) just become sillier as more time is dedicated to explaining them. John Carter takes a while to find its emotional center too in spite of a screenplay credited in part to novelist and vocal pulp fan Michael Chabon. Though at times taciturn to a fault Kitsch is soulful and charismatic as Carter and he looks the part of a ridiculously handsome pulp hero. But the film apart from a bit of additional backstory gracefully integrated in a series of flashbacks struggles to make him a character of any depth beyond his description of himself early in the first Barsoom novel A Princess Of Mars ""I have ever been prone to seek adventure and to investigate and experiment where wiser men would have left well enough alone."" Yet about halfway through John Carter follows the example of its hero who initially struggles just to move across the surface of his new home then discovers he can soar. With the exposition out of the way Stanton turns the film into a ripping adventure with gladiatorial combat against towering many-armed albino apes and first-rate effects. And the action comes in the service of a determinedly old-fashioned story that finds Carter rushing to defeat the bad guys in time to keep Martian princess Lynn Collins from falling into the hands of a ruthless villain played by Dominic West whos clearly enjoying the chance to play a simple bad guy. At its best it recalls Star Wars and Raiders Of The Lost Ark in the way it joins of-the-moment technology with the sturdy rhythms and easy thrills of an old B-movie. Thats no small accomplishment. Where many effects-driven films have used CGI carelessly and ceaselessly to diminishing returns Stantons team has a real interest in building a world from the distinctive Thark characters played by Dafoe Samantha Morton and Thomas Haden Church to the towering red Martian cities. A lot of the press leading up to John Carters release has focused on how much it cost but the old saw about the money being up there on the screen certainly applies and for once the money is truly in service of wonder. Rather than trying to overwhelm viewers by overloading the senses John Carters effects strive to create something new using as their foundation a book thats fired imaginations for the past century. Though it sometimes struggles to reach them John Carters high points could leave viewers dreaming of Mars for another hundred years.

Disney bet 250 million on an unproven star and a century-old western set on Mars. And it almost pays off Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Action movies John Carter Movies Science Fiction and Fantasy Entertainment News Taylor Kitsch in ""John Carter"" In considering the fate of ""John Carter"" the Disney studios 250 million gamble on a Wild-West-goes-to-outer-space yarn thats 100 years old its tempting to observe that two of the biggest box-office bombs in recent Hollywood history have been movies set on Mars. With little sense that the barrage of worldwide publicity has built up much public appetite for ""John Carter"" is the Mouse prepared for No. 3?You cant say Disney wasnt warned. One of those Martian elephant eggs was a quite recent Disney film one the studio and the rest of us have done a good job forgetting. The execrable anti-feminist animated nightmare ""Mars Needs Moms"" came and went without much fuss a year ago but viewed through a long lens it looks like one of the biggest disasters in film-industry history piling up net losses in the ballpark of 140 million. The difference may have been that by the time ""Mars Needs Moms"" was released Disney knew it was a turkey. Even at this writing nobody knows quite what to expect from ""John Carter"" a long-long-brewing Edgar Rice Burroughs adaptation that marks the live-action directing debut of Pixars Andrew Stanton director of ""WALL-E"" and ""Finding Nemo.""My verdict is that while ""John Carter"" may well go down in history as a great folly its no ""Mars Needs Women."" (Nor is it the misbegotten 2000 adventure flick ""Red Planet"" with Val Kilmer and Carrie-Anne Moss which reportedly cost 100 million to make and earned back about a third of that.) Its a profoundly flawed film and arguably a terrible one on various levels. But if youre willing to suspend not just disbelief but also all considerations of logic and intelligence and narrative coherence its also a rip-roaring fun adventure fatefully balanced between high camp and boyish seriousness at almost every second. Stanton even makes a case of sorts for the relevance of the Carter yarns which were pretty nearly the first American science fiction and prefigured so much that would come later from Robert Heinlein to Ray Bradbury to ""Planet of the Apes"" to ""Star Wars"" to ""Avatar."" Whether theres anywhere near enough mass interest in this antediluvian franchise to turn it into a 21st-century hit well Im afraid thats quite another story.One might almost compare ""John Carter"" to Brian De Palmas ""Mission to Mars"" even though the films are quite different in stylistic and generic terms. Both are sumptuous grandiose and profoundly silly spectacles liable to inspire over-the-top flames from some viewers and impassioned defenses from others. At this point Disney would probably accept a similar outcome with gratitude; while ""Mission to Mars"" was one of the worst-reviewed movies of the 2000s (at least in the United States) it came close to breaking even overall.Filmmakers have eyed Burroughs series of novels about John Carter -- a former Confederate cavalryman turned Western adventurer who is thrown into the three-way civil war waging on Mars (sorry ""Barsoom"") -- as potential material since at least the 1930s. You have to admire Stanton for wading so confidently into that long history of failure talking big about spinning this unknown hero and his unproven star (Taylor Kitsch of TVs ""Friday Night Lights"") into a three-film franchise. He signed up novelist and pulp aficionado Michael Chabon to rewrite the screenplay perhaps to lend the project some geek authenticity. I think thats cool and all -- but A) theres no way to make Edgar Rice Burroughs not seem silly and B) seriously whos going to care? Are there legions of Burroughs buffs out there demanding fealty to the text of ""A Princess of Mars""?Indeed thats my mystified reaction to ""John Carter"" in general So the ""WALL-E"" guy has made an immensely expensive special-effects movie that combines a western and a sword-and-sandal epic and a proto-steampunk action-adventure and is set on Mars. Thats kind of interesting But what the hell were they thinking? It doesnt help that ""John Carter"" gets off to a slow and murky start lurching back and forth between the digitally created ""predator city of Zodanga"" which is bent on conquering all of Mars and our eponymous hero pursued through the rainy streets of Manhattan circa 1881. That narrative encloses another one when Carter dies suddenly and leaves his nephew Edgar ""Ned"" Burroughs (Daryl Sabara) his private journal and then two more when the journal reveals how Carter discovered a mysterious cave years earlier in the Arizona Territory and was thence teleported into a new life on another world. You Might Also Like Things pick up considerably once Carter -- played by the muscular long-haired Kitsch with a persistent wise-ass smirk that somehow isnt obnoxious -- reaches the surface of Barsoom and is captured by the Tharks a violent but noble race of 9-foot-tall six-limbed aliens with walrus tusks and a vaguely Christian mythology. Its a little bit ""Avatar"" and a little bit ""Planet of the Apes"" and a little bit ""Man Called Horse"" and even a little bit ""Tarzan"" and yes I know that the Carter franchise predates all of those (even Tarzan whom Burroughs invented after Carter). Possessed of godlike superpowers in the lower Martian gravity Carter bounds around in obviously fake fashion rescuing the sultry and nubile Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins) princess of the besieged city of Helium who is supposed to be a scientific genius but spends most of her screen time looking bodacious in increasingly skimpy Barsoomian fashions. Yeah the warring humanoid city-states of Mars are called Helium and Zodanga. I giggled too. Burroughs established an all-time low in dopey science-fiction names pretty much at the moment of the genres creation.Theres one-on-one gladiatorial combat and big chaotic battle sequences and an incomprehensible plot involving the vicious and stupid prince of Zodanga (Dominic West) whos being manipulated by three immortal guys in robes (led by the always excellent English actor Mark Strong) who claim not to give a damn about anything but also seem to feed off planetary destruction. Or something. Zodanga Playing the ruler of Helium and father of Dejah Thoris Irish actor Ciaran Hinds gets to wear the most awesome military uniform Ive ever seen which appears to have been jointly designed by Julius Caesar George Washington Idi Amin and Karl Lagerfeld. (Sacha Baron Cohens fictional Arab dictator can eat his heart out.) At its best ""John Carter"" is a mightily impressive spectacle cleanly photographed in dusty reds and brilliant blues by Daniel Mindel which dares to straddle that elusive boundary between awfulness and wonderfulness. Its awfully wonderful or wonderfully awful. As so often with big expensive Hollywood disasters the real problem with ""John Carter"" is tone. Can you think about ""Battlefield Earth"" or ""Ishtar"" or ""Waterworld"" or ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash"" -- with a net loss amounting to 94 percent of its production cost pretty much the all-time dog -- without laughing? Big movies fail when those who make them lose all perspective on how to make them and whom theyre making them for -- when they strike a tone thats completely misguided and often unintentionally hilarious. You can feel Stanton struggling to bring the confidence wit and style of ""Wall-E"" and ""Finding Nemo"" to bear upon this leviathan but he cant quite pull it off. Whatever tone hes trying to impart gets eaten by the pure bigness of the project and youre never sure whether hes embracing this ludicrous antiquated fable of a pioneer American on Mars or making fun of it. You could argue that that ambivalence is interesting on some intellectual level sure. But from a commercial point of view its contagious and likely to be fatal. Dont buy your ticket for the sequel quite yet. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Yes there is life on Mars in ""John Carter"" and its deadly dull.These are not words you would expect to use in describing a film from Andrew Stanton director of the Oscar-winning Pixar favorites ""Finding Nemo"" and ""WALL-E"" whos making his live-action debut. And yet there they are and theyre inescapable.Except for a strong cast a few striking visuals and some unexpected flashes of humor ""John Carter"" is just a dreary convoluted trudge -- a soulless sprawl of computer-generated blippery converted to 3-D. Its the unfortunate film thats loaded with exposition and yet still ends up being massively confusing.It probably will also seem rather derivative but thats because the source material Edgar Rice Burroughs classic pulp tale ""A Princess of Mars"" has been so influential on pop culture in general and science fiction specifically for the past century. Youll see glimmers of ""Superman"" in our heros leaping ability some ""Star Wars"" in the insect-like flight vehicles and a whole lotta ""Avatar"" in the lanky alien creatures who inhabit Mars as well as the interplanetary romance that blossoms. John Carter himself played with rugged independent quiet by ""Friday Night Lights"" star Taylor Kitsch seems akin to Clint Eastwoods Man With No Name. And his smart-alecky deadpan quips in the face of adventure and danger recall the glibness of Indiana Jones.Still the film as a whole may seem impenetrable for the uninitiated.From a script by Stanton Mark Andrews and Michael Chabon ""John Carter"" finds the title character a Civil War veteran prospecting for gold suddenly transported from the vast craggy landscape of the American West to the vast craggy landscape of Mars (or Barsoom as its known here). There he finds himself in the middle of a different kind of civil war between various species.He becomes the prisoner of the six-limbed green-skinned giant warrior Tharks led (through motion-capture performances) by the benevolent Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe); his daughter Sola (Samantha Morton); and the gruff Tal Hajus (Thomas Haden Church). Meanwhile the humanoid factions from Helium and Zodanga are battling for control of the whole planet. Heliums Princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins) is being forced by her father (Ciaran Hinds) to marry Zodangan leader Sab Than (Dominic West) in hopes of achieving a truce. The devious Sab Than has other plans in mind with some encouragement from Matai Shang (played by the ever-reliable bad guy Mark Strong) one of a trio of troublemaking shape-shifting Therns.You keeping up so far? You need a flow chart? Youre not alone.Anyway Dejah escapes and John Carter rescues her -- or at least thinks he rescues her. Wearing little more than a bra a loincloth and some henna tattoos Dejah is an impossible mix of beauty brains and butt-kicking prowess. Shes a scientist AND a swordswoman -- and ""John Carter"" is refreshing in allowing its female lead to be every bit the equal of her male counterpart.From here John Carter must decide whether to remain a stoic loner and go back to Earth or stay and fight the good fight for the betterment of another planet. There are plenty of battles to be had with various creatures (in which Kitsch is as nearly nude as Collins is so everyones happy) but also way too much chatty nonsense about ancient scripture and gates and goddesses and some blue sparkly weapon thingy that gives its bearer super-duper powers.None of this provides ""John Carter"" with the sort of rousing crowd-pleasing momentum that a long-gestating blockbuster with a reported budget of 250 million should have; it all seems rather dense and self-serious.Thankfully theres the pleasingly goofy creature who becomes John Carters de facto animal companion. Hes sort of a monster-dog hybrid an overgrown pug with a sweet smushy face incredible speed and boundless enthusiasm.

But the sprawling interplanetary sci-fi bash John Carter proves its possible for a superhero to be incredibly good-looking?in the wrong way. Taylor Kitsch who stars as the messianic pulp space warrior created a hundred years ago by Edgar Rice Burroughs has soft bedroom eyes a pinups pout and straight long hair that makes him look like an easy-listening star from 1974. On Friday Night Lights Kitsch had a pleasingly direct loose-limbed charisma but within the stoic arid and often wordless fantasy universe of John Carter hes clad in a breastplate and loincloth and he comes off more like the Abercrombie amp; Fitch model he once was. Its as if he were out to save an entire planet by lapsing into Derek Zoolanders poses. Kitsch looks marvelous but thats the problem He looks a little too marvelous. Hes all sexed up with little to do. None of this is really the actors fault. As a character John Carter has appeared in countless iterations over the past century (novels and serials; comics from Dell DC Marvel and Dark Horse; graphic novels like The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen). His fusion of valor and mystic ability casts a shadow over the whole superhero genre -- and also movies like Star Wars. Yet when seen through the lens of all that has come afterward what was once original and visionary just seems wanly plodding and routine. A hero of the Virginia Confederate Army teleported through space and time Futuristic combat on Mars Big whoop. John Carter a 250 million spectacle based on the very first Carter novel marks the live-action directorial debut of Andrew Stanton one of the wizards of Pixar (he directed WALL?E and Finding Nemo). But Stantons visual brilliance as well as his storytelling wit gets lost amid all the blah hardware and monochromatic dust. There is hardly a moment in John Carter that isnt stamped by the generic spirit of franchise filmmaking. A lengthy prologue set in New York and Arizona in the mid-1800s has a wax-museum deadliness about it. Then Carter is transported to Barsoom (Burroughs fictional name for Mars). He wakes up in a desert that looks like a bombed-out Monument Valley and soon discovers his one effective superpower With the gravity so much less forceful than it is on Earth he can take flying leaps like a long jumper. This must have seemed pretty damn exciting in 1912. Now frankly its more than a little dorky. Carters ability to bound has a ""Gee is that it?"" quality. Carter doesnt know that hes left Earth until set upon by the Tharks a tribe of ubertall green warriors who look like skeletal versions of E.T. with twin sets of arms and horns jutting out of their cheeks. Theyre cool to look at for about five minutes but though played via motion capture by Willem Dafoe Thomas Haden Church and Samantha Morton theyre less differentiated from each other than say the Navi of Avatar and their scenes grow dull. There are also humans on Mars but the moment we meet them we too seem to have been transported -- to a bad sci-fi movie from the 50s. Ciaran Hinds in the kind of thatchy wig no actor can triumph over sulks and frets as Tardos Mors leader of the red-tattooed Heliumites and Lynn Collins as his princess daughter Dejah Thoris bats her eyes at the camera like a Gossip Girl version of Elizabeth Taylor in Cleopatra. Meanwhile Dominic West smirks as Sab Than leader of the dastardly Zodangans. Hes Carters rival for Dejahs affections but its a Flash Gordon love triangle cheesy and predictable. The Heliumites fly around in contraptions that look like aerial pirate ships ringed with feathers from a giant badminton birdie. Stanton keeps cutting back and forth between visually sleek shots of them and the clunky action taking place on board. He seems to have forgotten the first rule of digital effects They dont work unless theyre fully integrated. But then nothing in John Carter really works since everything in the movie has been done so many times before and so much better.

What a surprise then that John Carter--leaden title and punishing running time be damned--is a lively visually crafty pleasure. The story concerns the late-19th-century adventures of reclusive Civil War vet and pacifist Carter (Friday Night Lights panty-dampener Taylor Kitsch charming but flat) whos inexplicably transported to Mars (""Barsoom"" to the natives) and reluctantly drawn into another conflict. Before you can say ""Tim Riggins in space"" Carter acquires superpowers buddies up with a race of four-armed big green men falls in love with the heiress apparent (Lynn Collins) of a matriarchal society and gets a dog more or less. Any action-inclined moviegoer has already absorbed loads of the extraterrestrial gladiator-cum-cowboy trappings of Burroughss Mars series--he published nearly a dozen Carter books over 25 years. The achievement of John Carter is that it takes the elements worn to nubs by everything from Star Wars to Avatar to TVs Fringe and makes them fresh again. Credit goes to director Andrew Stanton (WALL-E Finding Nemo) and his co-screenwriters Michael Chabon and Mark Andrews (like Stanton a Pixar regular) who have a clear regard for Burroughss pulp ethic creaky and racially suspect as it is (the green Martians remain simple-living savages compared to the more advanced white humanoid ones) and the smarts to infuse it with disarming condescension-free levity. Disneys dedication to getting maximum bang for its special-effects buck deserves mention too despite the studio having spent enough here to oh end world hunger. Having been a Tarzan kid myself I cant vouch for the movies fidelity to its source but if you find yourself drawn into the thing its beside the point anyway.

"John Carter (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review John Carter (PG-13) The mega-budget adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs novel is ridiculously fun. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald3/7/2012 Editor rating 3 At almost no time during John Carter will you understand what in the name of Edgar Rice Burroughs is going on. There is talk of a ""predator city"" and a ""ninth ray"" but precisely what they are remains somewhat mysterious. Most of the action takes place on a planet called Barsoom (we call it Mars) inhabited by a race called the Tharks savage primitive towering beings with four arms and horns who go in for gladitorial sports and a group of slightly better dressed tattooed humans who call themselves ""red"" but are in fact more orange-y sort of like the cast of Jersey Shore without the sexually transmitted diseases. There is time travel and space travel and a big friendly lizard that acts like a dog -- and apparently a place to buy hair extensions. And heres the thing despite all this John Carter manages to be a ridiculous amount of fun even if you are immune to the charms of Taylor Kitsch (Friday Night Lights) running around in what amounts to a stylish loincloth. Based on A Princess of Mars by Burroughs -- who wrote a series about John Carter but is best known as the creator of Tarzan -- the film is directed and co-written by Andrew Stanton who directed Finding Nemo and Wall-E and co-wrote both as well as logging writing credits on all three Toy Story movies. You know who else co-wrote John Carter? Michael Chabon. Yes. That Michael Chabon the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier amp; Clay whose love of comic books is legendary. This intriguing fact does not mean you wont hear stilted lines like ""In the time of oceans they walked among us"" and ""My people . . . . Ive failed them all."" This is comic book material through and through nothing showy or high-brow and its written by people well-versed in its tropes and language. As the film opens cavalryman and Civil War veteran John Carter (Kitsch) sends a telegram summoning his college student nephew -- named Edgar Rice Burroughs -- to meet him at his Virginia estate. When the kid gets there he learns his uncle has died and has left him the estate and all his peculiar maps and papers in particular a journal that comes with instructions to read it right away. Young Edgar settles down with the diary and propels us into the story of Carters tragic past his disdain for fighting other peoples fights his obsession with a hidden cave of gold and how he ended up on Barsoom leading the battle for the planets future and winning the heart of a princess (Lynn Collins) who can happily hold her own in a sword fight. Stanton treats the material with just the right light touch; even though the characters take whats happening seriously the mood of film never falls prey to the lofty self-importance that overwhelmed Avatar. John Carter has no interest in preaching to you though theres some nominal talk about how man is a warlike being bent on destruction which is demonstrated by the evil Sab Than (Dominic West) who wants the princess hand in marriage but may have more nefarious plans for her. Yes. John Carter is one of those movies in which nobody ever calls their offspring something simple like Ken or Dave. The Martian princess is Dejah Thoris. Theres also this guy Matai Shang (Mark Strong) who ""serves the goddess"" as he says and is one of a time-traveling shape-shifting band of elders that act as air traffic controllers for destruction. Id tell you some of the Tharks names but Im getting a headache just thinking about it. So yes John Carter can be exhausting in its complexities and yes its easy to mock. But its light years more fun than George Lucas clunky Star Wars prequels and it wins you over despite any reservations you come into the theater with. When youre dumping the 3D glasses into the recycling bin you have to admit you enjoyed your time on Barsoom. There may be shame but there will much less regret than you imagine. Cast Taylor Kitsch Lynn Collins Samantha Morton Willem Dafoe Mark Strong Dominic West Ciaran Hinds. Director Andrew Stanton. Screenwriters Andrew Stanton Mark Andrews Michael Chabon. Based on ""A Princess of Mars"" by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Producers Lindsey Collins Jim Morris Colin Wilson. A Walt Disney Pictures release. Running time 132 minutes.

John Carter Bad to fair Director Andrew Stanton. Cast Taylor Kitsch Lynn Collins Willem Dafoe. Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action. Or more explanation. Footnotes. An intermission. Something. Its not for lack of a pedigree. The film is based on the Edgar Rice Burroughs story ""A Princess of Mars."" Its directed by Andrew Stanton whose credits include ""WALL-E"" and ""Finding Nemo"" and he gets a free pass for life for writing parts of all three ""Toy Story"" movies. The screenplay is credited to Stanton Mark Andrews and the great novelist Michael Chabon of all people. Somehow despite that boatload of talent the movie never really comes together. It feels like a mishmash of styles and other films -- a little ""Avatar"" here (OK a lot) a little Ray Harryhausen there. Its too much really -- a phrase that could serve as the subtitle of the film. It begins in New York City in 1881 with a framing device in which Burroughs himself (Daryl Sabara) is summoned to the estate of his uncle John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) an adventurer who dies before Burroughs arrives. Carter left a fortune to his nephew but also a diary that explains his greatest adventure. A Confederate captain in the Civil War Carter heads west looking for gold and finds mostly trouble. But he stumbles onto a cave that has all the gold he dreamed of and more -- much more. Thanks to an amulet he is transported to Mars (which the inhabitants call Barsoom). It too is wracked by a civil war. Hes found by the Tharks who look kind of like youd think Martians might green extra arms tusks on their faces that sort of thing. Theyre decent sorts though for the most part and theyre fascinated by Carters strength and leaping ability a result of the different gravitational pull and muscle mass etc. The Tharks are fighting the Zondangans led by Sab Than (Dominic West) who has a nearly perfect weapon bestowed on him by three sort of wise men only one of whom speaks. But the speaking wise man is played by the great Mark Strong so thats OK. Then there are the people of Helium led by Tardos Mors (Ciaran Hinds) whose daughter Princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins) can most accurately be described as the resident hot research scientist. Hey if that sounds sexist filmmakers should have put her in something other than a Martian bikini for most of the movie. Tardos wants to marry her off to Sab to try to make peace between their people but theres all manner of intrigue afoot. The trick is keeping up with it all and thats not easy. Kitsch was great as Tim Riggins in the television version of ""Friday Night Lights"" and at the outset of the film when Carter is defying authority at every turn Riggins rebel spirit comes to mind. That spirit fades over time however The more exotic the world Carter discovers becomes the more generic his character becomes. Collins gives Dejah a certain strength -- shes far from the helpless damsel in distress. Strong is always entertaining and Willem Dafoe and Thomas Haden Church are good as voice actors for the animated Tharks. But at well over two hours and with enough plot elements to fill a movie twice that long ""John Carter"" ultimately suffers from a couple of simple problems though apparently ones not easily solved Its all too much and its too hard to follow. Less is more and this movie proves it. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter twitter.com/goodyk.

(AP) Interminably long dull and incomprehensible ""John Carter evokes pretty much every sci-fi classic from the past 50 years without having any real personality of its own. You could say much the same about the title character as uncharismatically played by the unfortunately named Taylor Kitsch of TVs ""Friday Night Lights. Even in 3-D hes barely one-dimensional. Created a century ago by Edgar Rice Burroughs of ""Tarzan"" fame for a pulp serial John Carter is a Civil War veteran who somehow wakes up on Mars. Hes drawn into a romance with a warrior princess and a series of battles between two groups of humanoids nearly impossible to tell apart. Despite the reported expenditure of as much as 300 million of Disneys money and the live-action debut of director Andrew Stanton (Pixars brilliant ""Wall-E"") its hard to care about anything going on in this shapeless would-be franchise which lurches from scene to scene without building any real excitement. PHOTOS THE MOST EXPENSIVE MOVIES OF ALL TIME Nor is there even anything all that visually distinctive. David Lynchs ""Dune -- one of many films that invites unfavorable comparisons -- may be every bit as hard to follow as ""John Carter but at least it didnt look like dozens of other movies. This wheezy humorless epic doesnt make it easy to sit through the many key sci-fi tropes that Burroughs 1912 story (originally called ""A Princess of Mars) is credited with inventing. Think of ""John Carter as a landlocked ""Waterworld (that 1995 fiasco starring Kevin Costner) with its bare-chested hero wandering through the arid landscape of Mars (called Barsoom by the locals) as a captive of the four-armed lizard-like Tharks (Willem Dafoe voices their leader) a la ""Planet of the Apes. After what feels like four hours things improve briefly with the arrival of the feisty scantily clad Princess Leia -- sorry Princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins) of Helium. She can handle a sword (the weapon of choice on Barsoom) with aplomb but is defeated by reams of gibberish-laden expository dialogue. For reasons I couldnt begin to explain her father the king (Ciaran Hinds) has promised her hand in marriage to the villainous Sab Than (Dominic West) of the Zodangans. Even with a writing team that includes Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Michael Chabon its nearly impossible to keep track of who is doing what to whom (and why) in a cluttered narrative that also includes the immortal shape-shifting Therns (led by Mark Strong) whose motives are even more baffling. To this muddle ""John Carter adds a pair of confusing framing stories One involves J.C.s nephew the writer Edgar Rice Burroughs (Daryl Sabara) and is set in an 1881 London thats vaguely reminiscent of the Tarzan adaptation ""Greystoke. The other takes place in 1870 Arizona where an Army officer (Bryan Cranston in a blond wig) is trying to conscript the widowed J.C. -- whos more interested in a cave full of gold -- to fight Indians. Got all that? The effects are nowhere near as jaw-dropping as youd expect from a movie this expensive. The white apes who confront Carter in an arena look less fearsome (and real) than those polar bears from the Coke commercials. And when Carter discovers he can take 100-foot leaps because of Mars lower gravity the effect is more silly than awe-inspiring. Even the digitally enhanced battle sequences are boringly staged compared to those in the ""Lord of the Rings trilogy. This is the sort of movie where characters spend entirely too much time declaiming things like ""War is a shameful thing ""Helium is lost and ""We may have been born worlds apart but I know you John Carter Alas after more than two hours I didnt come close to knowing who John Carter is -- and I didnt really care. His unexciting exploits kept making me wish that I was re-watching ""Raiders of the Lost Ark or ""Avatar -- two other classics ineptly aped by ""John Carter. Instead I was enduring a movie even more soul-sucking than ""The Phantom Menace.

"John Carter | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Review John Carter Peter Debruge Chief Film Critic AskDebruge 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr March 6 2012 | 0455AM PT To watch ""John Carter"" is to wonder where one might find the intuitive sense of wonderment and awe director Andrew Stanton brought to ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Wall-E."" Fanboys have been waiting a long time for a bigscreen adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs Mars-traveling John Carter character -- 100 years to be exact since the opening installment of the pulp legends Barsoom series was published -- with ""Wall-E"" director Andrew Stanton ultimately being the one to bring his bluescreen vision of the Red Planet to life. But given the enormity of Disneys investment ""John Carter"" will need more than just the faithful to support the franchise the studio has in mind and this turgid visually unappealing sci-fi adventure never gets off the ground. As such profitability feels like pure fantasy. Though Burroughs Tarzan character has spawned countless bigscreen adaptations his other beloved pulp hero Civil War officer-turned-intergalactic warlord John Carter has had far worse luck transitioning to film (unless you count 2009s straight-to-DVD ""Princess of Mars"" starring Traci Lords and Antonio Sabato Jr.). Over the years several filmmakers imagined using animation whether hand-drawn (Bob Clampett) or stop-motion (Ray Harryhausen) to bring Burroughs various Martian species to life so it makes sense that Disney would tap one of Pixars most prized directors to spearhead the project which would inevitably demand considerable amounts of CGI. Yet to watch ""John Carter"" is to wonder where in this jumbled space opera one might find the intuitive sense of wonderment and awe Stanton brought to ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Wall-E."" Instead of allowing us to discover this incredible alien world Stanton plunges directly into a sloppy gun battle wherein what look like flying Roman galleons blast each other with laser cannons then back to Earth for 20 minutes of Victorian-era exposition. When Carter (Taylor Kitsch) -- whom the pic introduces twice once as an eccentric globe-trotting treasure hunter circa 1881 and then 13 years earlier as a surly Arizona gold prospector -- finally makes it to Mars he observes that the locals are far more primitive than the opening-scene tease suggested. Thats because the planet is divided into separate species. The creatures who encounter Carter wandering their desert are Tharks a race of six-limbed spear-wielding warriors (motion-capture performed by actors such as Willem Dafoe Samantha Morton and Thomas Haden Church). Though the 9-foot green-skinned Tharks look much as Burroughs described them they are curiously unappealing to human eyes just one of the stylistic decisions that reinforces the accomplishment of James Camerons ""Avatar."" For the kind of sex appeal that brings teenage libidos to a boil one need look no further than the Red Martians especially Helium princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins) with her tan skin and henna-style body art. Writing a century ago Burroughs saw a world in which racial conflicts would threaten world harmony and some version of this idea plays out in the film as rival Red Martian clans -- beautiful Dejah on one side sadistic Sab Than (Dominic West) on the other -- battle for a mysterious blue power supply controlled by yet another species the discord-seeking Therns (headed by a shapeshifting Mark Strong). Stanton and fellow screenwriters Mark Andrews and Michael Chabon from the outset ignore the importance of audience identification. When Carter awakens on Mars to find that the gravity allows him to jump great distances we should be experiencing that discovery through his eyes. Instead the movie has no point of view unspooling with the same stodgy distance favored by mid-century sword-and-sandal pics. Burroughs provided scant backstory for Carter a perfectly fine strategy for a character who will ultimately be defined by his actions (see Sergio Leones ""The Man With No Name"" trilogy). But the filmmakers decided Carter should be haunted by a dark personal tragedy he will later need to overcome supplying flashbacks nearly identical to scenes from last summers ""Cowboys and Aliens."" Of course working from such widely influential source material poses an impossible challenge How to make elements that have inspired some of the greatest science-fiction storytellers seem fresh? In places the film seems to be borrowing directly from George Lucas and Steven Spielberg when the truth is neither ""Star Wars"" nor Indiana Jones would exist had Burroughs not come before. Still those filmmakers understood how to make their movies iconic. Stanton has been given the resources to create an expansive expensive world but lacks the instincts to direct live-action a limitation that shows most in the performances. Bare of chest and fair of feature Kitsch doesnt exhibit enough charisma to carry a project of this scale. The movie begs a strong unifying musical theme but the best that Michael Giacchino can muster is a vaguely ""Lawrence of Arabia""-sounding score while the designs of everything from Martian cities to alien life forms lack the visionary qualities that lodge in ones imagination much less spark toy sales and theme-park attendance.

It was absurdly expensive (rumours suggest upwards of 250 million) stars no one youve ever heard of (the voice cast notwithstanding) is based on a property very few outside the geek community are familiar with has a wildly convoluted storyline packed with silly names and outlandish locations is saddled with one of the least exciting titles in recent memory and was directed by a relative newcomer getting his hands on a major live-action studio picture for the first time. Taylor Kitsch is John a reclusive ex-soldier who discovers a secret portal to the planet Mars - or Barsoom as its known in the local language. There he steps into the middle of a war between the forces of evil led by preening conqueror Sab Than Prince of Zodanga (Dominic West) and the forces of general decency as represented by philosopher-scientist-princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins).Now maybe there are legions of multiplex-goers to whom the words Sab Than Prince of Zodanga sound like a surefire bet - but its unlikely. And this is merely the tip of a hefty iceberg chuck in some four-armed Tharks some eight-legged Thoats and Mark Strong as an evil spirit and youve got an unholy mess. Luckily thanks to some stunning visual design a sense of wry humour and Wall-E director Andrew Stantons knack with an action setpiece its a very entertaining unusual and loveable mess.  John Carter could be Dune for the 21st century - or it could be the next Avatar. Only time will tell.

Recommended but for Sci-Fi buffs and fans of the cast only. Those who seek a meaningful art house movie look elsewhere.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 12 2012entertainedFeaturedAgree with the review. It felt a bit like Stargate to me. Saw the 2D version and didnt feel like there were scenes just thrown in for 3D. Was entertained despite the dodgy leaping about effects near the beginning that sort of looked like he was dangling on strings from the waist. Oddly it ended up seeming not as made-up as it did at the start and enjoyed some of the humour too.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 11 2012SophieFeatured3 is exactly the right verdict - its ludicrous barely makes sense and the script seems like a bit of an afterthought but also great looking endearing and a huge amount of fun.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 10 2012ScrumpyjackFeaturedFirst half of Ians review is SPOT ON....so why am I going for a 4? BECAUSE the film CONSTANTLY looks GREAT (the 3D is STUNNING....look its FUTILE to deny) and the action (A LOT of it) is quality. Rushing back to see it? NO. Had a DAMN good 2 amp; a bit hrs? YES SIR 7+/10FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 10 2012IanFeaturedMy money is on this being a Dune and not an Avatar. It looks stunning in places and you can see where the money was spent. If only they had spent some of it on a decent script. Kitsch is wooden and Collins little better. Throw in two Brits as the bad guys and you have your classic modern mishmash of a film. It really is making films like painting by numbers. Disney obviously saw the money made on Avatar and decided we will have some of that. In a few weeks I fully expect this film to start getting Heavens Gate type analogies. It really is that awful. It no doubt started with good intentions but ends up as a supermodel of a film. It looks good but has no content and you will soon get bored of it.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 7 2012tom huddlestonFeaturedRob I think we have different understandings of the meaning of the word notwithstanding. Im fairly sure my usage was correct there. I too had heard of the voice cast. And weeeeeelll (if that is your real name) i would have thought the words entertaining unusual and loveable might have given away the fact that I liked it. to call a film a folly is by no means a criticism in fact its kind of a term of endearment.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 6 2012RobFeaturedI have heard of the voice cast so your use of the word ""notwithstanding"" is totally incorrect.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/90507/john-carter.html,200,johncarter38,johncarter,timeout

TWITTER Director Andrew Stantons Disney extravaganza is a rather charming pastiche if perhaps not one with sufficient excitement and razzle-dazzle to justify the reported 250 million production budget. Given that its based on a pioneering work of science fiction there can be little surprise that John Carter feels like a hodgepodge of any number of familiar elements some of which were no doubt borrowed by others from Edgar Rice Burroughs and brought full circle here. This Disney extravaganza is a rather charming pastiche if perhaps not one with sufficient excitement and razzle-dazzle to justify the reported 250 million production budget. Neither classic nor fiasco the film will likely delight sci-fi geeks most of all but theres enough here for general Disney audiences as well to generate solid box office worldwide. PHOTOS 10 Biggest Book-to-Big Screen Adaptations of the Last 25 Years If Avatar had never existed its possible that John Carter would have seemed like more of a genre breakthrough given the premise of a distant planet penetrated by an Earthling who begins an interplanetary romance and is ultimately accepted into the alien culture (Mars here even has a huge arboreal structure at the heart of things). But echoes resonate from many other sources as well What came first the Jedi of Star Wars or the Jeddak leaders here? Was Taylor Kitschs buff loincloth look inspired by how good Charlton Heston looked similarly attired in Planet of the Apes? Doesnt John Carters background consist of one part Outlaw Josey Wales and one part Indiana Jones? And doesnt the specter of the ancient Greeks noticeably hover over the everlasting battles being fought among the various neighbors? The Princess of Mars the first work by Burroughs ever published began being serialized in 1912 and was issued as a novel six years later. Neatly the author has been brought onstage here in an 1881 framing device as the young nephew of the just-deceased adventurer John Carter who has been called to New York City to be shown a journal the dead man has intended for Edgars eyes only. PHOTOS Hollywoods A-List Redefined As in Burroughs story Carter is a Confederate soldier drawn west after the Civil War by the lure of gold. But no sooner does he find it than he happens upon a cave massively feared by the Indians one which serves as a portal to a place that looks very much like the American West but is in fact the desert-like Barsoom that fourth planet in the solar system that has often been fantasized about as a possible home to some form of life. The first species Carter encounters when he awakens are just-hatching critters that grow up to become Tharks thin tusked six-limbed greenish-skinned creatures that are quite jumpy about being in year one thousand of their struggle with the nasties from Zodanga whose arrogant prince Sab Than (Dominic West) has just acquired a new lethal amulet. The Zodangans hover about aboard giant airborne craft that look like Star Wars by way of Baron von Munchausen and are accompanied by three holy men most notably the all-knowing and shape-shifting Matai Shang (Mark Strong). Even though theyre allied with the aristocrats of Helium -- whose elite including the Jeddak (Ciaran Hinds) and his daughter Princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins) are kitted out with British accents chintzy costumes and the occasional bad wig reminiscent of a 1950s Ray Harryhausen adventure -- the poor Tharks desperately need more help if they hope to survive. When they see how Carter can leap tall rocks in a single bound by virtue of the thin atmospheric conditions they decide hes their man. It would take repeated viewings to determine how many times Carter is captured and then escapes in the story line devised by screenwriters Andrew Stanton Mark Andrews and Michael Chabon. More a series of incidents than a gracefully composed drama of rhythmic arcs and elegantly defined acts the film finally settles its principal attention on the dilemma of Princess Dejah whose high-minded scientific orientation (reminiscent of that of Rachel Weiszs Hypatia in Agora) contributes to her disinclination to play obedient daughter and marry the venal Sab Than for political reasons as her father requests. With Kitsch and Collins having shared a previous life together in X-Men Origins Wolverine their characters here bask in the sight of two moons as they compare notes on the structure of the solar system and in an appealingly unconventional unsentimental way get together. Stanton who directed Finding Nemo and WALL-E co-directed A Bugs Life and had a hand in writing all three Toy Story features here follows Brad Bird by three months in moving from Pixar animated eminence to live-action fare. Although the result is quite a mishmash dramatic coherence prevails over visual flair; the colors skin tones image sharpness and cohesion of diverse pictorial elements are less than stellar though the 3D is effective with comparatively little brightness sacrificed by donning glasses. (The film was reviewed in Imax 3D.) For a Pixar graduate piece humor is notably lacking. Long-haired bearded and skimpily clad through most of it Kitsch fills the action-hero bill neither more nor less. With raven-black hair framing lagoon-blue eyes Collins who was an arrestingly unconventional Portia in The Merchant of Venice with Al Pacino eight years ago also was a far from predictable Hollywood-style choice here so sharply does she attack a standard-issue part. In support Strong and James Purefoy the latter as a lightly impudent factotum from Helium supply the most color.
