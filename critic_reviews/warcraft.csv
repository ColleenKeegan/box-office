Of course everything is a competition now the gaming of America which began with the emergence of team sports in the early 20th century and accelerated with the advent of video games in the 1980s has reached its logical conclusion in a presidential contest destined to play out as a real-time strategy game.

Entertainment ""Warcraft"" Is Definitely Not The First Great Video Game Adaptation To be fair its not Mortal Kombat Annihilation either. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Warcraft Universal Pictures ID 8826798 Warcraft feels like a bad date both parties are desperately trying to make the best of smiling brightly through every lull in conversation and pretending an awkward hug was the totally optimal way to say good night. Movies being made from popular video game properties is a setup that on paper makes sense but in practice turns out to be a chemistry-free matchmaking of talent material and form. Theres a decades-long tradition of mediocre-to-atrocious versions of this and Warcraft isnt the feature thats going to change that.But it really seems like it should have been. Director Duncan Jones who also wrote the screenplay with Charles Leavitt pursued the long-in-the-works adaptation of the Blizzard video game series after Sam Raimi who was originally attached left. Jones whose previous films include the lowish-budget breakout Moon and the Jake Gyllenhaal thriller Source Code is a gamer himself. More importantly hes an endearingly open and unabashed geek the kind whod treat a saga about warring orcs and humans mages in high towers and a green-glowing death magic called ""the Fel"" with all seriousness and no hint of nose-holding. If anyone could make a decent movie out of Warcrafts past-its-prime high fantasy universe it should be Jones an ideal banner-carrier for Hollywoods melding with Comic-Con culture.Warcraft isnt decent. It isnt awful either though that would honestly be preferable -- the sort of distinctive kamikaze train wreck whose spirit you admire. Instead it comes across as a series of impersonal compromises made by talented people whove resigned themselves to the fact that major movies these days are more brand product than cinema. View this image > Universal Pictures ID 8858535 It racks up its victories in what it doesnt do. It doesnt makes the clash between the humans of Azeroth and the orcs arriving through a mystical portal into a simplistic battle of good and bad guys. It doesnt use its main female character the half-orc Garona (Paula Patton emoting impressively around fang-y prosthetics) as an ornament or a damseled plot device. It doesnt allow all of its many characters to live to the end which offers room for a few surprises.But it also doesnt provide the audience with any reason to care about its central conflict or the reasons behind it. It attempts to pack two realms worth of world building in along the sides of a full-speed-ahead story that kicks off with the invasion. The film begins with an orc chieftain named Durotan (performed via motion capture by Toby Kebbell) and his pregnant mate Draka (Anna Galvin) joining a war party that promptly charges through a portal opened by the life-force-hoovering orc Guldan (Daniel Wu) a warlock who is intent on leaving the clans dying land behind and conquering a new one.The humans -- repped primarily by smirky warrior Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel opting for an utterly bonkers spectrum of accents) King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper) and Lady Taria (Ruth Negga) -- notice that mysterious forces have been wiping out local villages and garrisons. Fledgling mage Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) insists its time to call on Medivh (Ben Foster easily the most giggle-inducing part of the cast) the kingdoms powerful reclusive Guardian. By the time Durotan begins to question Guldan and the locale into which hes leading the orcs Lothar and Khadgar have begun to suspect someone on their side has gone dark as well. If this sounds like a lot to absorb it is. View this image > Universal Pictures ID 8858531 Jones previous movies were character-driven despite their high-concept sci-fi nature. Moon was carried by the weight of Sam Rockwells performance as a man slowly realizing the extent to which hes become a disposable cog in a ruthless corporate machine. Source Code did the same thing with Jake Gyllenhaals soldier who is turned into an unwilling experimental recruit desperately trying to will himself a way out of two seemingly dead-end realities. But Warcraft feels like its battling with time (and itself) to establish its characters as anything other than fodder for its numbing fantasy melees.An underdeveloped thread involving Lothars young soldier son Clearly Doomed -- er Callan (Burkely Duffield) -- is laughably predictable. The hint of romance between Lothar and Garona is allotted a minute during which the actors appear to be considering whether kissing each other is even possible when tusks are involved. Schnetzer whos much better in the upcoming hazing drama Goat is inert as a baby magician who goes from thinking he knows whats really happening to knowing he knows whats really happening. Foster is introduced doing some less-than-stately shirtless clay sculpting and only gets more ridiculous and incomprehensible from there.Its only Garona presented as a half-human half-orc version of the ""tragic mulatto"" who manages heartfelt drama in being forced to choose between the clan who has alternately despised enslaved and protected her and the humans whom she doesnt know or trust. Patton works twice as hard as the rest of the cast to sell the characters pain and confusion and through her you can glimpse the potential Jones must have seen in the film as a whole. But shes the strength in whats otherwise a centerless garble of orc-on-human skirmishes orc-on-orc showdowns betrayals overload of mythology and sequel seeding. View this image > Universal Pictures ID 8858538 Warcraft treats its material with deep solemnity but never makes the case for why it deserves such regard why a movie version of this material means anything other than ditching gameplay in order to focus on a setting and characters that in the context of the big screen just feel like diluted Tolkien swirled with a little Game of Thrones. Warcraft isnt the first great video game movie but its one that makes you wonder what the point of such adaptations is in the first place when they end up flattening so much of what makes gameplay appealing. Whats left is something that doesnt seem like it needs to exist or even really wants to -- its two hours worth of a movie thats simply waiting for the right moment to ask for the check and head home.

In short the last thing you need if you inhabit the world of men is an orc passing through a mysterious portal and trashing your peace of mind. Needless to say thats just what happens in Duncan Joness new movie which is based on a video game. Azeroth ruled by a valiant king (Dominic Cooper) is besieged by an army of invading orcs among them the vicious Guldan (Daniel Wu) and the more reasonable Durotan (Toby Kebbell). Other names include Varian Medivh and Halforcen; one of the rare charms of this fantastical world is that most of the characters sound like medications to be taken twice daily after meals. Joness film is crowded and scattershot. We hang out with a young magician (Ben Schnetzer) an older magician (Ben Foster) and a resourceful warrior (Travis Fimmel) but neither their gifts nor their destinies detain us for long. Even acts of sacrifice in the grand finale feel morally weightless designed largely to pave the way for a sequel.

"Warcraft | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; warcraft ) Warcraft (U.S./China/Canada 2016) June 12 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli Viewed purely from the perspective of a computer game adaptation Warcraft can be deemed as successful. For players it expands the reach of the realm of Azeroth adding another layer to the games mythos. However as a motion picture designed for a general audience (the majority of who may not be gamers) Warcraft is a failure. With its spastic borderline-incoherent narrative amateurish acting and lack of effective world building Warcraft feels like a Lord of the Rings wannabe that comes close to matching Peter Jacksons seminal trilogy only in terms of visual impact. Yes there are times when Warcraft is awe-inspiring. It features some great images (although there are instances when the CGI becomes overwhelming) which makes it all the more disappointing how completely the screenplay lets down the work of the effects designers. Warcraft provides the shell of a great fantasy adventure saga but never effectively goes beyond that. This is much more like the bad fantasy of the 1980s and 1990s than the better brand we have recently become accustomed to. The movie brought to the screen by Duncan Jones (whose Moon was one of the best recent low-budget sci-fi films) tells of the beginning of an orc-human war. The human kingdoms are led by King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper); his faithful warrior friend Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel looking disconcertingly like Paul Rudd in need of a shave); and the Guardian mage Medivh (Ben Foster). The invading marauders fleeing a dying world follow the evil wizard GulDan (a motion-captured Daniel Wu). One of the fiercest orc chieftains Durotan (a motion-captured Toby Kebbell) is dubious of GulDans intentions and methods and his opposition results in strife within the ranks. Meanwhile the humans have to contend with a betrayal of their own and an armed force unable to match the orcs for numbers or ferocity. Given a considerably larger canvas its possible that the basic storyline of Warcraft could have been woven into a compelling fantasy adventure. The potential at least is there. Crammed into two hours however we get tropes and little else. Character development is as perfunctory as narrative thrust rushing ahead at breakneck pace without ever pausing to allow the situations to breathe. World building in particular suffers as a result. Azeroth feels more like a stage for battle and bloodshed rather than a ""lived in"" realm. The movie assumes viewers have played the game and isnt especially interested in luring ""outsiders"" in. There are a few effective portrayals. Ben Fosters Medivh has the right amount of gravitas and mystery. Toby Kebbells Durotan although as much a product of motion capture imagery as performance is perhaps the best realized character in the movie. Dominic Cooper is disappointing. The normally reliable actor seems out of his element although thats nothing compared to Travis Fimmel and Paula Patton. Patton whose skin is colored green exudes a sense that shes plotting fiendish things to do to her agent. Fimmel meanwhile plays Lothar like hes in a parody. His approach would be pitch-perfect for The Princess Bride but is fatally misguided for Warcraft. Its impossible to take him seriously. Warcraft offers an experience of sorts for those who have spent long hours playing the game. This is an opportunity to encounter familiar places creatures and characters in new surroundings. But the films clunky screenplay mires it in the muck with such unmemorable titles as Conan the Destroyer and Dungeons and Dragons (okay its not as bad as either of these but thats damning with faint praise). While its true that not every fantasy property needs to have the grandeur of scope and complexity of plot of The Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones it needs more than what Warcraft provides. Large scale battles and magical pyrotechnics are nice supplements but the absence of well-formed characters and a meaningful narrative render such pretty things moot. As a commercial for the game however Warcraft works and maybe thats the yardstick of success against which this film should be measured.

Instead youve got a complicated unexpected hero in the orc chieftan Durotan who starts having second thoughts about conquering the world of humans after he discovers rot at the top of the orcish chain of command. (Even a marauding barbarian should pause where magic is concerned even when that magic is employed to revive his stillborn son.) Of course our natural sympathies are with humanity under siege -- the brave king the dashing knight the youthful sorcerer -- but there are hard choices on both sides choices that involve real costs. Less real the strange hyper-crisp super-saturated depiction of armor fur skin and greenery. But if it feels slightly fake its gorgeously so like the too-red blood of old horror films. There are plenty of flaws -- an overabundance of storylines chief among them followed by the occasional slip into silly action and/or overdone effects -- but what fun to discover some virtues to set against them.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size David Sims Jun 10 2016 Culture The act of describing Warcraft seems beyond that of a mere mortal critic. This is a film that requires an instruction manual going in--or perhaps years of training alongside solemn mages--simply to possess the superhuman endurance needed to enjoy it. Its based on a series of video games but the story resembles a conversation about The Lord of the Rings overheard at a loud bar There are orcs yes and humans and some magic too but after that things get very complicated and extremely forgettable. Warcraft is a well-meaning attempt to present a colossal fantasy world largely unknown to moviegoers using recognizable tropes and then instantly subverting them. It is also a calamitous failure. Related Story Party Fowl The Angry Birds Movie Is an Allegory Right? Its a particular shame given that Warcraft (a 160-million epic from Universal) is directed by Duncan Jones a promising voice in genre filmmaking whose debut Moon was one of the best sci-fi films of the last decade. With Warcraft he tackled a challenge Hollywood has continually struggled with--turning an uber-popular video game into something resembling a linear blockbuster narrative. Even the most audacious games can feel a little flatter onscreen simply because their plotting feels so familiar and Warcraft suffers in that regard. It tries to offer a new angle on the high-fantasy storytelling viewers have seen onscreen for decades but eventually it just descends into another weak action hodgepodge.On to the plot which flows as plentifully in Warcraft as the CGI. First there are the orcs a race of hulking warriors with boar tusks for teeth who are possessed of a rather fearsome underbite and represented through sophisticated motion-capture technology. Their universe has been ravaged by some apocalypse so a spiky green shaman called Guldan (Daniel Wu) has zapped open a portal for their warriors to run through beginning a war with a world called Azeroth. This new place is home to humans elves dwarves and plenty more though were mainly introduced to the humans.Jones who co-wrote the script with Charles Leavitt strives to present heroes and villains on both sides which keeps Warcraft from being another tale of strapping white Euro-warriors taking on a dark horde of man-beasts. Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel) is a steadfast knight for the kingdom of Azeroth backing up the noble King Llane (Dominic Cooper) while the lead orc Durotan (Tony Kebbell) is a new father and respected chieftain whos suspicious of Guldans dark magic.Theres also Garona (Paula Patton) a half-orc (her tusks are much less prominent) who straddles both sides of the conflict and Medivh (Ben Foster) a mysterious human wizard who may or may not be up to no good. At the beginning of the film Medivh is carving a giant golem statue in his tower--and you know what Chekhov said about introducing a golem in the first act. Medivh is constantly warning about ""the fel"" a source of evil magic that seems to be driving the orc invasion but like so much of Warcrafts fantasy jargon theres absolutely no wider explanation of what it is or how it works--its just quickly name-checked as if the audience should understand whats going on.Warcrafts story resembles a conversation about The Lord of the Rings overheard at a loud bar.This happens over and over again Characters spout whole monologues about the ""Guardian of Tirisfal"" or the rules of ancient orcish battle rituals and things quickly become too muddled to even hope to keep track of. Warcraft doesnt engage in much world-building; instead it throws viewers into an already-constructed world expecting theyll get the gist of it. And perhaps they would if the film werent such a jarringly edited mess overloaded with sub-Tolkien dialogue about sorcery and honor that consistently lands with a clunk.Unfortunately theres no Han Solo here no wiseacre for audiences to hold onto as someone with a remotely relatable personality. Though the movie is already quite silly--a wizard played by Ben Foster literally carves a 15-foot golem out of clay--there isnt much deliberate comic relief since everyone is as deadly serious as the fel magic they wont shut up about. Anduin is a noble warrior whose motivation is winning the war and defending his king. Llane is a noble ruler whose motivation is protecting his people with honor. Durotan is a proud chieftain whose motivation is obeying the customs and traditions of his clan and keeping them safe.There are supporting characters like Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) a wizard who abandoned his monk-like order who would feel rebellious if Schnetzer werent so apple-cheeked and idealistic. Garona the half-orc warrior caught between two races should probably be the protagonist of the film but shes too often pushed to the side advising one hero or the other or trying to inspire a little romantic tension. Patton is a wonderful actress but pulling off a good performance in such a dramatically inert environment is a task even a level-50 mage would struggle with.Perhaps most frustratingly over its two-hour running time Warcraft only builds to more exposition The promise of future tales to be told of character arcs paying off in promised sequels of yet another globe-conquering franchise Hollywood has vainly tried to conjure up to keep pace with all the superheroes. Its likely the producers felt they had earned such arrogance with a huge budget fancy CGI and a well-known brand. And perhaps with a different story or with a more clearly explained world the film could have worked. Sadly when the time came Warcraft failed to cast its spell.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics. Continue Reading Gary Cameron / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 62 A Man Who Can Be Baited With a Tweet James Fallows None Last night in her overall very successful acceptance speech Hillary Clinton said with ruthless precision about her opponent Ask yourself Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Do our Facebook posts reflect our true personalities? Incrementally probably not. But in aggregate the things we say on social media paint a fairly accurate portrait of our inner selves. A team of University of Pennsylvania scientists is using Facebook status updates to find commonalities in the words used by different ages genders and even psyches. The so-called ""World Well-Being Project"" started as an effort to gauge happiness across various states and communities. ""Governments have an increased interest in measuring not just economic outcomes but other aspects of well-being"" said Andrew Schwartz a UPenn computer scientist who works on the project. ""But its very difficult to study well-being at a large scale. It costs a lot of money to administer surveys to see how people are doing in certain areas. Social media can help with that.""

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s.

Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 10 2016 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Jun. 10 2016 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Duncan Jones Written by Duncan Jones and Charles Leavitt Starring Travis Fimmel Paula Classification PG Country USA Language English The action unfolds in fits and starts against seemingly infinite backdrops crowded with detail yet only roughly digitized. The point of view shifts rapidly from one character to another while the camera zooms in and out moving abruptly from vast perspectives to intense close-ups. Does Warcraft remind you of anything? Well a video game of course. It is easy to mock Warcraft. After all its a movie that wants you to empathize with a bunch of meathead orcs each one sporting a pair of curling tusks on his lower lip. Plus it is based on a video-game franchise that is also painfully long in the tooth. The American press was predicting a massive flop even before the movie screened for critics this week (while condescending to note that it is already playing very well in China).But to point to the movies obvious limitations seems to miss what is important here With Warcraft British director Duncan Jones himself an avid gamer and a director building a strong reputation for smart sci-fi (Moon; Source Code) seeks to honour not merely the broad outlines of Warcrafts orcs vs. humans storyline but also the visual and narrative experience of a video game.Of course a movie isnt interactive and most game adaptations - it is a smallish field with a poor reputation - attempt to cash in on popular properties by simply trading off the lure of interactivity for the delights of big action on a big screen. Joness much more intelligent and aesthetic approach to the problem is not entirely new - the Resident Evil franchise has been credited with successfully reflecting the video-game sensibility - but it does make Warcraft visually interesting throughout.As human characters appear against patently computerized backgrounds or the camera pulls back to reveal impossibly vast canyons towering cliffs or dazzling cities the effect is reminiscent of the shimmering vistas of those ghastly Clone Wars episodes in the Star Wars franchise back when filmmakers were drunk on the possibilities of CGI.But more than a decade later the effect here is purposeful reproducing the alluring vertigo of gameplay. Similarly the abrupt shifts in camera angles including both dizzying heights and odd depths - one shot is from beneath an orcs chest as she lies on the ground - seem to mimic the perpetual reloading of images as the player navigates the game.The story also takes its inspiration from a central aspect of a multi-character game You can choose which side you want to play. Here that means we switch continually between the orc story and the human one sympathizing with both.As his world shrivels and dies the orc chieftain Durotan must follow an increasingly demented leader through a magic portal into the human world where the orcs can suck life out of humans to replenish their own. On the human side the warrior Lothar must fight off the orcs to save his king with help from an erratic magical Guardian his increasingly confident acolyte Khadgar and Garona the co-operative orc Amazon whom the humans have taken prisoner. (The names are both complicated and silly but no more so than the Frodos Gandalfs and Aragorns who populate The Lord of the Rings.)This narrative is strongly constructed with a workaday plot of sacrifices and betrayals plus a few hints of the environmentalism that animated James Camerons Avatar. What is less successful is the actual dialogue as Jones and his co-writer Charles Leavitt struggle to find a heightened tone that will fit pseudo-medieval royals without sounding merely pompous. They lurch around a lot in that regard.The creators do however have a nice solution to the language barrier between the two species. The orcs speak in English among themselves but that becomes incomprehensible orcish when the humans are around. Attempts at humour on the other hand fall painfully flat as the writers reach for the kind of smartass repartee that so enlivened the first Star Wars trilogy but completely fail to grasp it.The characters are one-dimensional but this is fantasy fiction not domestic drama. In particular Dominic Cooper and Ruth Negga have no material with which to fashion the wafer-thin king and queen. Neggas character is then badly shortchanged by the movies conclusion as Jones who has flirted with the idea that this realm might not be a patriarchy quickly abandons the idea. Still the performances of Travis Fimmel Toby Kebbell and Paula Patton as the warrior Lothar the orc hero Durotan and the half-orc/half-woman Garona all awakening to the evil forces around them are meaty enough to hold attention.Ben Schnetzers counterintuitive performance as the magician-in-training Khadgar also grew on me as his flat pedestrian tones eventually seemed to take hold of the magical character. Otherwise the supernatural and in particular the bad wizards are unevenly served up by the special effects team with Ben Foster doing an erratic turn as Jesus Christ a.k.a. the Guardian Medivh. While the orcs are often engrossing and the manifestations of wizardry more or less mysterious the final effect is badly spoiled when a giant clay golem that looks laughably like the Thing in Fantastic Four blunders into the picture.Will gamers themselves steeped in spiralling fantasy worlds enlarged by their own imaginations find this all too little? They will almost certainly find that the movie 10 years in the making comes too late. At the screening I attended publicists were handing out T-shirts to audience members who could answer skill-testing questions and it was clear that the crowd had no idea how many versions of Warcraft have been issued by Blizzard Entertainment to date - and didnt really care. Bonus points though to the woman who correctly identified the year the first Warcraft game appeared 1994. Joness significant achievements in this movie may well die at the North American box office.

This action fantasy is a mind-numbing (and mind-dumbing) tale of humans and orcs that either knows how ludicrous it is and refuses to admit it or simply has no clue. Either way its hard to imagine a more colossal clunker this summer.Fans of the hugely popular video game series upon which its based will find it hard to care about this story of wizards and spells and dimensional portals which has all the accessibility of a deep web message board discussion about LARPing. Even the actors -- especially an in-over-her-head Paula Patton as Garona a green-skinned half-orc and Ben Foster as a robe-wearing guardian with shifting loyalties -- look like theyd rather be playing video games.Director Duncan Jones who co-wrote the screenplay with Charles Leavitt does pack some impressive visual oomph into this lead-footed turkey so its not a total washout. But his attempts to bring coherence to the story are met with a deadening thud.The story opens when the orcs hulking creatures who all look modeled after Ron Perlman use a glowing gateway to invade the land of Azeroth to escape their dying world of Draenor. Loyalties and motivations are tested as war draws on and only the most scattered attempts at levity in the script break up the huge blocks of narrative sludge.Jones -- director of 2009s over-praised ""Moon"" and son of David Bowie -- may have been the right man for this job but thats assuming anyone was the right man for this job. ""Warcraft"" isnt meant for the movies.

Then again video game movies generally fall on a quality spectrum somewhere between thuddingly mediocre and utter crap. You dont get to roll in piles of dung and then be angry when people say you stink. Warcraft tries hard to break this dark curse remaining faithful to the spirit and colour of Blizzard Entertainments long-running series of strategy and role-playing games while standing on its own as a piece of entertainment. But despite bringing the game world to life with impressive visual effects it gets impaled by a muddled plot and hammy performances. Directed by Duncan Jones who did the cerebral sci-fi flicks Moon and Source Code Warcraft tells the tale of a race of fierce orcs who having exhausted the resources of their dying world open a magic portal to the peaceful realm of Azeroth. While their invasion is brutal and murderous its motivated by a desperate desire for survival that makes them oddly sympathetic. The orcs created with sophisticated performance-capture effects are fantastic. In fact these entirely computer-generated characters - including Toby Kebbell as the thoughtful orc chieftain Durotan and Daniel Wu as the villainous shaman Guldan - outshine the human actors to such a degree that any time the action shifts to smirking warrior Lothar (Vikings Travis Fimmel) or inscrutable wizard Medivh (Ben Foster) we long to go back and see whats happening with the orcs. (Paula Patton does her level best as the sexy headstrong half-orc Garona but its impossible to take her green makeup and stubby fangs seriously.) Jones who co-wrote the script does a good job of elevating the orcs beyond sword-fodder villains but the story strives for a complexity that gets undermined again and again by cliche-riddled dialogue pacing problems and performances that sometimes feel like they came out of a high school adaptation of The Lord of the Rings. The movie ends with major conflicts left unresolved and Universal is clearly hoping to launch an ongoing franchise that will delve into the rich lore of this universe. But if Warcraft wants to return for a sequel itll need to up its game.

The true horror of this film is that it features a roster of actors who shouldnt have to resort to this sort of thing Despite what you may have heard Warcraft--a movie based on the staggeringly popular series of video games--is neither the worst movie ever made nor the greatest. Its director Duncan Jones (Moon Source Code) actually knows what hes doing and the story hangs together surprisingly well considering that the movies official synopsis opens with ""The peaceful realm of Azeroth stands on the brink of war as its civilization faces a fearsome race of invaders"" and ends with ""From opposing sides two heroes are set on a collision course that will decide the fate of their family their people and their home."" You try making a movie out of that while keeping a straight face. Still there are a few things in Warcraft to enjoy at least in a pointing-and-grunting sort of way Women characters flounce around in abbreviated animal-skin outfits almost glammed up enough to look at home Roxy Music album cover. The Azerothians if thats what you call them strut around in silly but not-wholly unattractive medieval-faire garb while the heavily CGI-enhanced Orcs--those would be the invaders the most memorable of whom is Toby Kebbell as the principled warrior Durotan--are bulked-up in a repulsively fascinating way. They stomp around on their heavy beefy feet looking perpetually a bit forlorn and perplexed thanks to the specific dental characteristic they all share underbite fangs. Still the Orcs arent a wholly uncivilized people. Their big problem is that theyve come under the rule of a despot which is why theyre on the rampage in the first place. Left to their own devices they have some intricate societal rules and theyre affectionate toward their children. That doesnt mean there isnt room for improvement They show a fondness for over-accessorizing that would make even Iris Apfel blanch. Fave style accents include multiple facial piercings necklaces made of bones and animal teeth and hippie braids threaded through beads. Apparently theyve never heard of Coco Chanels apocryphal style rule ""Look in the mirror before you leave the house and remove one accessory."" Or even just ""Elegance is refusal."" Anyway that kind of visual insanity--plus a few crazy battle sequences--are the things that make Warcraft almost worth watching if you still find yourself at loose ends after youve given the dog a bath organized 10 years worth of tax returns and completely moth-proofed your closet. The true horror of Warcraft is that it features a roster of actors who shouldnt have to resort to this sort of thing. In China the film made 45 million on its opening day so anybody who gets a cut of international box office profits will be laughing all the way to the bank. Even so--what is Dominic Cooper perfectly fine in pictures like The Duchess An Education and The History Boys doing shambling about in sub-King Arthur gear? Seeing Ben Foster playing a magickal Merlyn-Gandalf hybrid (who isnt even by the way enough of either) is dispiriting. The Ethiopian-born actress Ruth Negga plays a regal queen here and she escapes with her dignity intact. Negga is so superb in Jeff Nichols Civil Rights drama Loving to be released later this year that she may just win an Oscar--unscathed she will leave Warcraft behind her. But Paula Patton as a half-human half-Orc warrior woman Garona deserves so much better. Patton has one of the biggest roles in Warcraft and is hands down the chief reason to bother with it--she gives a real performance dusted with subtleties that are pretty much wasted in this otherwise big dumb Jethro Bodine-scaled spectacle. Patton has been terrific in some underappreciated pictures like the 2008 Outkast musical Idlewild (a modern classic that will someday get its due) and shes given sturdy appealing performances in movies like Brad Birds Mission Impossible--Ghost Protocol and Tony Scotts Deja Vu. And she gave the best performance in Lee Daniels Precious as a conscientious teacher. In Warcraft she can barely deliver her lines--her prosthetic underfangs keep jabbing at her upper lip giving her a slight lisp. By the end of Warcraft shes the only character who makes you wonder What will she do next? For this she deserves combat pay. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

"Theres magic amid the messiness of Warcraft - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Theres magic amid the messiness of Warcraft Warcraft Universal Pictures Toby Kebbell stars as Durotan in the fantasy adventure ""Warcraft."" Toby Kebbell stars as Durotan in the fantasy adventure ""Warcraft."" (Universal Pictures) Justin Chang Near the end of ""Warcraft"" -- an elaborate exhausting cinematic collision of humans and Orcs live actors and digital extras geek enthusiasms and multiplex dollars -- the director Duncan Jones grants us a breather from all the thundering mayhem. A hooded oracle with an uncanny (and unbilled) resemblance to Glenn Close emerges from the shadows to deliver some cryptic words of wisdom ""From light comes darkness and from darkness light.""There are a few different ways to read this prophecy. Is it a metaphor for the intimate coupling of good and evil on this epic canvas? An assurance that the end is coming and with it the lights that will guide your relieved exit from the theater? A promise that -- even without the cheat sheet supplied by the thoughtful folks at Universal Pictures -- the storys impenetrable tangle of names and lineages far-flung realms and otherworldly species will eventually be made clear to the uninitiated? See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story That promise is kept up to a point even if the end result is not enlightenment so much as weary battered resignation. Having never read the novels or played the games in Blizzard Entertainments massively popular ""Warcraft"" franchise (unless the sound of my college dorm mates pounding their computers next door counts by way of osmosis) I can attest that its possible to spend much of this movies two-hour running time in a state of blissful incomprehension -- carried along less by the cluttered exposition of the script than by Jones fervent commitment to his own world building.There are stretches of tedium in this lumpy and derivative mythology to be sure. But there are also immersive IMAX 3-D backdrops striking ambiguities and irresistible moments of straight-faced lunacy. The line between hack work and labor of love may be perilously thin but you can sense the difference in the way Jones earnestly wholeheartedly embraces the magic that powers this realm Not since the last ""Harry Potter"" movie have you seen this many wizards with dazzling CGI lightning bolts crackling at their fingertips. Missteps and all the movie pulses with a true believers conviction. Thats reassuring as it would otherwise be hard to imagine a more drastic or puzzling leap than the one Jones has made over the course of three movies -- from the deft minimalist science fiction of his 2009 debut ""Moon"" to this frenzied maximalist sword-and-sorcery circus. (In between came ""Source Code"" his divertingly clever brainteaser starring Jake Gyllenhaal.) Yet even within the confines and compromises of this studio-engineered behemoth -- the latest high-priced Hollywood attempt to transmute an interactive brand into box-office gold -- there are telltale signs of a filmmakers vision. SNAP Video See more videos Working from a screenplay by Charles Leavitt (the writer of last years forgettable fantasy ""Seventh Son"") Jones has extended one of his recurring dramatic themes by plunging us once more into a world of uncertain allegiances and dubious systems of power. The world in this case is Azeroth a realm whose green forests and towering citadels are not too far removed visually or conceptually from J.R.R. Tolkiens Middle-earth with which it shares a similarly diverse population of humans elves dwarfs and Orcs.Those Orcs -- a horde of hulking brutes with foul tempers huge tusks and awesome piercings -- actually hail from a kingdom called Draenor (so named according to legend for its exceptional plumbing) but have now chosen to invade the peaceful lands of Azeroth through a giant cross-dimensional portal. They are led by the evil Guldan (Daniel Wu not that you can tell beneath the horns) who plans to conquer Azeroth using the Fel a form of magic so dark and corruptive it runs the risk of destroying everyone and everything before the sequel arrives.Join the conversation on Facebook >> Trying to work against Guldan and save his people is the wise and well-muscled Durotan (Toby Kebbell) a respected Orc chieftain whose wife Draka (Anna Galvin) is about to give birth. The eventual fate of their improbably cute pointy-eared infant suggests the filmmakers are not above plundering the Old Testament along with ""The Lord of the Rings"" ""Star Wars"" and other seminal pop mythologies. The film owes a particular debt to James Camerons ""Avatar"" -- not only in its skillful use of performance-capture technology to bring a fictional race to credible life (Kebbells Durotan is an expressive standout) but also in the way it complicates our sympathies where its human characters are concerned. Warcrafts China box office nabs records in first two days Ryan Faughnder Whether the Orcs and humans of ""Warcraft"" can appeal to American moviegoers remains an open question but theres little doubt about their pull in China.  The Legendary Pictures and Universal Pictures film has grossed up to 92 million in China in its first two days of release according to studio... Whether the Orcs and humans of ""Warcraft"" can appeal to American moviegoers remains an open question but theres little doubt about their pull in China.  The Legendary Pictures and Universal Pictures film has grossed up to 92 million in China in its first two days of release according to studio... (Ryan Faughnder) Some of this is strategic. Jones pointedly introduces Durotan and his fellow Orcs first and we soon grasp that Guldans unchecked megalomania notwithstanding the horde is bent on survival rather than domination. Theres also the unfortunate fact that most of the human characters are far less memorably realized. The biggest disappointment is Anduin Lothar the formidable commander of Azeroths military forces given a colorless poor-mans-Aragorn interpretation by the Australian actor Travis Fimmel (best known for the TV series ""Vikings"").Lothars chief nemesis is an all-powerful enchanter known as the Guardian whose own private dabblings with the Fel -- basically the Dark Side of the Force but with fewer syllables -- do not bode well for humankind. (The Guardians inevitable turn toward treachery is perhaps signaled too early by the fact that hes played by Ben Foster.) Elsewhere Dominic Cooper makes a wanly regal king of Azeroth while Ben Schnetzer is a nicely impetuous Khadgar a gifted young sorcerer following his own difficult destiny. Straddling the two opposing races is Garona a half-Orc half-human who is played in the flesh and sans performance-capture by a green-skinned Paula Patton. Forced to align herself with Lothar and his companions Garona is the most conflicted of the movies major characters initially scornful yet increasingly accepting of her captors human vulnerability. Attentive fans may well divine some similarities between Garona and Gamora the similarly green-hued heroine played by Zoe Saldana in ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" They may even be inclined to remark on a dubious trend of talented black actresses having to make like Margaret Hamilton in ""The Wizard of Oz."" Ill leave it to more advanced ""Warcraft"" scholars to parse the movies tricky racial politics which are offset to some degree by the casting of Ruth Negga as Azeroths wise and compassionate queen. Ridiculous as it might seem Jones actually invites this level of scrutiny His movie seeks to overturn the familiar humans-good beasties-bad formula and to show that no side can claim to be exclusively good or evil.As heads get smashed and limbs get severed during the climactic battle -- goosed by the surge and sweep of the score by composer Ramin Djawadi (""Game of Thrones"") -- your mind might start casting about as mine did for a real-world political subtext. Are we supposed to infer something from the characters clashing shades of red and blue war paint? Is Guldan with his callous disregard for his followers the Orc version of Donald Trump? (Is there even a difference?) The film which ends mid-battle and with an eye on the franchise horizon doesnt say. Maybe Glenn Close already said it all. ------------WarcraftMPAA rating PG-13 for extended sequences of intense fantasy violenceRunning time 2 hours 3 minutesPlaying In wide releaseALSOWarcraft probably a U.S. dud seeks profitability via ChinaReview Now You See Me 2 is more slight than sleight of handReview James Wans touch makes The Conjuring 2 a worthy shivery sequelDebating summers most anticipated summer movies Do we really need another Jason Bourne?justin.changlatimes.com Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times James Wan Paula Patton Glenn Close Indie stalwart James Schamus makes his directorial debut with Indignation Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-warcraft-review-20160606-snap-story.html,200,warcraft13,warcraft,latimes
"Warcraft another victim of game-to-movie jinx review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesWarcraft another victim of game-to-movie jinx reviewWarcraft is yet another flame-out in Hollywoods unceasingly struggle to turn video games into satisfying movies. And its a particularly frustrating one since writer/director Duncan Jones and co-writer Charles Leavitt do their darndest to tell a good story. Travis Fimmel and Paula Patton appear in Warcraft which probably should have remained just a video game.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. June 9 2016WarcraftStarring Paula Patton Travis Fimmel Daniel Wu Toby Kebbell Ben Foster Dominic Cooper Ben Schnetzer Rob Kazinsky Clancy Brown Ruth Negga and Callum Keith Rennie. Directed by Duncan Jones. At GTA theatres. 123 minutes. PGMore arduous than any video game skirmish is the unceasing struggle to turn these properties into satisfying movies.Hollywoods battlefield is littered with the bones of failed efforts right back to Super Mario Bros. in 1993. The problem it seems to me is that game characters morph and meld with the personalities of individual players while their film counterparts are rigidly defined by screenplays.Article Continued BelowWarcraft is yet another flame-out and a particularly frustrating one since writer/director Duncan Jones (Moon Source Code) and his co-writer Charles Leavitt (Blood Diamond) have made a sincere attempt to break the jinx.They labour to set up nuanced characters before smashing skulls and to bring a smattering of dramatic rigour to a sprawling videogame franchise that dates back to the early 90s which my sons fondly recall playing over dial-up modems. The picture looks suitably supernatural especially in IMAX 3D despite some dodgy CGI.Sitting through Warcraft is like watching a heavily abridged Lord of the Rings with all the good characters taken out. There are also nods to Avatar as well as the original Planet of the Apes and its recent rebooting.A magic Dark Portal opens between the orc hellhole of Draenor dominated by warmongering warlock Guldan (Daniel Wu) and the human paradise of Azeroth ruled by goodish King Llane (Dominic Cooper) his comely queen Lady Taria (Ruth Negga) and their military mainstay Commander Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel). Not as dumb as they look the orcs opt to violently relocate to Azeroth. Opening action suggests the orcs versus humans feud is timeless yet when a band of the horned beasties attacks a group of Game of Thrones extras none of the humans seem to have heard of them.The mobbing is further muddied by a parade of players and a stew of subplots multiple wizards who may be harbouring sinister secrets under their hoods; beautiful half-orc half-human warrior Garona (Paula Patton) whose bravery is beyond question but whose allegiance certainly isnt; and a faction of cruel-but-fair orcs led by new dad Durotan (Tony Kebbell) who dont so much want to vanquish humans as to raise their own families in peace and better dentistry.It takes nerve to make a paper-thin plot this convoluted and also some skill -- there are a few good action sequences. Ultimately the movie seems more focused on setting up sequels than exploring the abundant source material. The conclusion leaves more questions than answers brazenly riffing on a famous Bible story but rest assured that if Warcraft does well at the box-office the answers will come almost as quickly as you can cry ""Kill all humans""The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Credit Universal Pictures Probably the best way to experience ""Warcraft"" a generally amusing and sometimes visually arresting absurdity is stoned. If watching the big screen through a cannabis cloud isnt your idea of a good movie time though I suggest that you do what I did and just go with the incoherent flow. You may not grasp who the Bluto-like creatures with simian arms and woolly mammoth tusks are or why they seem permanently engorged with rage. But theres more to movies than narrative coherency as anyone who has sampled the cinema of Michael Bay or certain art films well knows.There is in this movie for starters the visual appeal of those Blutoesque beings lovingly fabricated and ornamented motion-capture creations who share their name with the creatures that J. R. R. Tolkien called orcs. Tolkien borrowed orc from the Old English citing ""Beowulf"" one of the many tales of blood lust and vengeance heroes and monsters that are woven into the ""Warcraft"" DNA. The ruler here is King Llane (Dominic Cooper) a rather progressive monarch who fights the invading orcs with a multihued army a rakish aide-de-camp (Travis Fimmel) a token chick (Paula Patton) and a magical twosome (Ben Foster and Ben Schnetzer). Video Movie Review Warcraft The Times critic Manohla Dargis reviews ""Warcraft."" By AINARA TIEFENTHALER and ROBIN LINDSAY on Publish Date June 9 2016. Photo by Universal Pictures. Watch in Times Video >> embed If theres a mythology here I missed it much as I also missed the charm and periodic lightness of Tolkiens world with its hobbits and Shire. ""Warcraft"" by contrast weighs in as a Hobbesian war of all against all though it does allow for a little romance and campy winks. It also more surprisingly offers some gray-shading notably with Durotan (Toby Kebbell) an orc chieftain with hands as big as Volkswagen Beetles and a pregnant mate Draka (Anna Galvin). He has qualms as well as enemies which surface amid battles and exposition. Stuff happens in one part of this world and other stuff happens elsewhere Jaws clench bodies fall and scenes oscillate -- twas ever thus genrewise.Even so despite the incessant clashing and clanging you can hear the tremulous pulse of a heartbeat. That faint thrumming belongs to Duncan Jones the director who against the odds has mined a watchable movie out of an entertainment franchise that started with a video game and now includes novels comics and assorted schlock (toys costumes a mah-jongg set). That Mr. Jones even factors into this production counts as some kind of actual achievement given that ""Warcraft"" is such an obvious bid at brand expansion which may be why no one bothered with an intelligible story. Apparently branded content (i.e. the characters their world) was meant to be enough. Photo Travis Fimmel and Paula Patton in ""Warcraft"" a fantasy action film extending the entertainment franchise that began with a video game. Credit Universal Pictures Whether you see more here will depend on your mileage and patience though moviegoers habituated to he-men (and the perfunctory she) pulverizing one another for 100 or so minutes are likely to have greater tolerance for this diversion than others might. As suggested trying to figure out whos doing what to whom and why -- or how orcs dress with such huge hands or how they chew steak with those tusks -- is often pointless when it comes to spectacles. In cinemas earliest years moviegoers thrilled not to stories but what the scholar Tom Gunning calls ""the cinema of attractions"" with its eye-pummeling shocks and tricks; were still getting pummeled story or no.Mr. Jones doubles down on the action though without any real shocks (or awe) but he also modestly complicates the question of the monstrous. The orcs in ""Warcraft"" prove somewhat more psychologically complex than any number of cartoon Hollywood villains -- theyre sincere for one -- and theyre generally better company than the king and his crew. It says something about Mr. Joness choices that he gives Durotan so much screen time and that Mr. Kebbell with the help of the special-effects wizards makes good use of that time with a nuanced moist-eyed turn that evokes old-studio gladiators like Victor Mature. Durotan is a beautiful brute and all the more human for it. Advertisement Continue reading the main story ""Warcraft"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Heads pop like grapes and so forth.

Rated PG-13 (fantasy action violence). The English director Duncan Jones started out his career promisingly with ""Moon"" and ""Source Code."" To measure the disappointment of his next choice ""Warcraft"" imagine that David Bowie instead of going off to Berlin to make ""Heroes"" had instead become the lead singer of Whitesnake. Jones (who happens to be Bowies son) is trying to deliver something like ""The Lord of the Rings"" minus the boring bits but without the boring bits what you have is Itchy and Scratchy with maces. ""Warcraft"" offers wizards giants duels magic tricks skull crushing chest pounding and a doomy soundtrack that goes dump-dump-dump. None of it means much of anything despite quarter-hearted efforts to add depth. At one point as an amiable encounter between a human and a foxy she-orc is winding up with all the sizzle of someone returning a pair of pants I said to myself Wait was that the big love scene? Its a time of unease between the massive orcs such as the powerful but open-minded Durotan (Toby Kebbell) and the humans led by the king (Dominic Cooper) and his most trusted knight Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel). Hard-liners among the orcs want war but Durotan isnt so sure. Despite his hideous face massive tusks and hands the size of pool tables hes a loving husband and daddy. Somehow pouring treacle on iron does not quite convince though The guys ""tender"" scenes remind me of the commercials they used to do for the Softer Side of Sears. Thanks to a go-between lady orc (Paula Patton) who has dainty she-fangs instead of tusks and hangs out with the humans there could be peace between the two races but only if the most hostile orcs and their snarly trouble-making wizard can be made to see reason. Thats my best guess for whats going on anyway not that it matters to Jones (who I suspect and hope was not fully in charge of this incredibly expensive-looking studio monstrosity). What the movie is really about is nonstop special effects deployment Theres foggy green magic dust being thrown around by one side glowy blue spheres of magic on the other. Warriors zip and zap through portals out of one dimension into another and trick each other into switching sides. The wizard on the human side is played by Ben Foster who has along with him a young ex-apprentice (Ben Schnetzer) you can think of as the wiz kid and who seems to be tossed into the pot in order to lure in a few tween girls. His presence is a sure sign that were not going to lurch into the kind of ""Conan the Barbarian"" depravity that could have made the movie cheesy fun instead of the joyless grind that it is. No ""Warcraft"" isnt a ridiculous mess; it holds together on its own musclebound terms. It neither tries to be jokey nor undercuts itself by being unintentionally funny. And it offers a bit more complexity than some other nonstop action flicks adapted from video games. Its a real movie just not a good one.

(Universal Pictures via AP/-) Topics Warcraft video-game 3 Share this article  share on facebook  share on twitter  share on google plus  share on Linkedin  share on whatsapp  comment  share on email share this article follow Us    It can be hard to tell orcs apart at first. The fictional giants of the ""Warcraft"" video game franchise all have mean faces protruding tusks and muscles so massive they make The Rock look puny. So it may take a while for non-gamers to figure out whos who in the battle of orcs and humans at the center of the ""Warcraft "" film which complicates an already dense mythology. Once it becomes clear that theres a civil war within the orc race about whether to eliminate or align with the humans the big-screen adaptation from director and co-writer Duncan Jones is a little easier to understand. For anyone unfamiliar with the fantasy games characters and story lines ""Warcraft"" is little more than eye candy a visual spectacle with a backbone of well-trod genre tropes. Theres just no way to become as invested during a two-hour movie as a gamer whos spent years maybe even decades immersed in the rituals and traditions of the worlds of ""Warcraft."" Plus the humanoid orcs rely on so much digital animation to come alive that at times the whole movie looks like a video game which obviously suits the material here but can still take a little getting used to visually. (This critics screening was in IMAX 3-D.) And it is certainly a spectacle with elaborate castles armies of angry orcs and a villain who dramatically sucks the life from his victims leaving them shriveled and deformed. Voiceover at the start of the film explains that humans and orcs have been at war for ages. The orc planet is dying so theyre out to colonize new territory which they access when their ruler Guldan (Daniel Wu) uses his powers to open a magic portal. The escaping orc clans storm in and kill everything. One clan leader Durotan (Toby Kebbell) is a rebel. He questions Guldans destructive approach and suspects he may be relying on evil forces which of course he is. Orcs are invading the world of Azeroth when the leader of the humans King Llane (Dominic Cooper) gets word of their imminent arrival. He turns to his top warrior commander of Azeroths military forces Lothar (a smoldering Travis Fimmel) and top wizard Guardian Medivh (Ben Foster) controller of Azeroths magical powers. They capture an orc-human hybrid Garona (Paula Patton wearing disturbing prosthetic teeth) who serves as a bridge between the two species -- and instantly catches Lothars romantic eye. Meanwhile young magician Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) endears himself to the operation when he discovers evidence of an evil force lurking in the human kingdom. (Read also Review Conjuring 2 scares but not as well as the first) Containing this powerful energy is ultimately the theme of film as it is of so many fantasy superhero and sci-fi stories. Its like the Force or the Ring or the Infinity Gauntlet or the Allspark. Only the force in ""Warcraft"" called ""the fell"" is purely wicked so evil it can consume the good -- perhaps an allusion to Biblical notions of ""the fall."" The ""Warcraft"" mythology is extensive and rich as it would have to be to sustain five video games and a series of novels. Thats a lot of lore to pack into one movie though this film is clearly set up for a sequel should the audience demand it. Without the franchise backstory ""Warcraft"" is a big-budget fantasy-action film with lots of large-scale epic fight scenes between Mr. Olympia-sized aliens and regular humans. When an orc throws a horse at one point its almost more painful than when a character dies since the moviegoers connection with the characters is so superficial. As escapist summer fare ""Warcraft"" works because the action is ample and the orcs look cool with pierced tusks and spiked armor evoking a ""Mad Max"" aesthetic even if it isnt always easy to tell them apart. ""Warcraft"" a Legendary Pictures release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""extended sequences of intense fantasy violence."" Running time 123 minutes. Two stars out of four. ___ MPAA definition of PG-13 Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for children under 13.

Universal Pictures via AP Britton Peele GuideLive BrittonPeele bpeeledallasnews.com Warcraft is not the first great video game movie but you can enjoy it anyway (C) Jun. 8 2016 1106am Close Sharing really is caring... Close Join the conversation... With Britton Peele Share This Story Share Discuss Meh I truly believe that somebody - maybe sometime soon - will crack the Video Game Movie code. A film will one day come along that does for video game movies what the likes of Iron Man and (more recently) Captain America Civil War have done for comic book movies.Maybe Duncan Jones isnt that somebody because Warcraft isnt that film.Which is a shame. The director has a short-but-stellar track record with the sci-fi films Moon and Source Code and his love for the source material of his latest movie is evident in every interview hes done. But Warcraft while a visual feast is little more than a dumb action blockbuster that has a bit of style but little substance. Travis Fimmel as Commander Anduin Lothar Universal Pictures via AP While the online hit World of Warcraft is the video game that most people including mainstream audiences know and love the franchise for the Warcraft movie actually goes back to the events of the 1994 strategy game classic (more specifically the events are based on a Warcraft novel The Last Guardian). It tells the story of the first battles between the humans of Azeroth and the war-minded orc race who have fled their dying world and hope to make a new home in humanitys domain. The orcs arent all of the same mind though and the dark magic being used by their leader Guldan (Daniel Wu) threatens to destroy their race from the inside.Surprisingly the first instance of disbelief in the events on-screen dont come until the first humans are on screen. The story opens with the orc chieftain Durotan (Toby Kebbell) and his mate who is pregnant with his child. Theres nothing new or earth-shattering about their interactions but impressive CG visuals make their relationship at least somewhat relatable (and oddly human). When we switch over to the human side of the conflict though were met with clichA(c)d lines overdone fan service (small nods to the video games that only gamers will catch) actions that make little sense and often stilted acting.Sometimes it feels as if thanks to the overwhelming amount of CG present in Warcraft many of the human actors had a hard time believing anything about the world they were supposed to inhabit. Good fantasy films exist (we live in a post-Lord of the Rings world after all) but some of the line deliveries in Warcraft could have been lifted directly from a C-tier made-for-TV movie. The implied romance between Lothar (Travis Fimmel left) and Garona (Paula Patton) isnt believable. Universal Pictures via AP The plot is mostly simple (disappointingly so) and easy to follow but there is also a problem of seemingly important concepts or characters being referenced with little to no explanation. Take the young mage Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) for example. He says hes part of the Kirin Tor but that hes run away for I dont know reasons. Wait what even is the Kirin Tor? What do they do? Why do they operate the way they do?And then youve got the Guardian Medivh (Ben Foster) whos like really good at magic apparently? But nobody really goes into detail about why hes treated like Gandalf on steroids. If you havent played World of Warcraft there are a lot of holes that go unfilled.You also get glimpses of dwarves and Blood Elves (though theyre not referred to by name) here and there but their appearances are few and far between. Which is odd considering that the orc invasion of Azeroth presumably threatens them just as much as it threatens the humans yet the humans have to do all the work to defend their homeland. Medivh (Ben Foster) looks more like a hipster Jesus than the worlds most respected sorcerer. Universal Pictures via AP But maybe all you really need to know is that there are orcs there are humans and theyre fighting. Because at the end of the day that conflict actually leads to some stuff thats pretty enjoyable to watch on screen.The very first magic spell effects feel a bit corny (and well ""video game-y"") but as they escalate in scale they help Warcraft become a joy to watch as a pure dumb popcorn flick. When youve got big green orcs tossing horses at human soldiers humans wielding large swords and shields covered in lion iconography gryphons flying overhead and spells flying through the air its easy to get caught up in how cool it all looks. You probably wont leave the theater thinking that a characters death was particularly sad or that another characters motivations were particularly compelling (because none of them are) but you might remember how awesome that weird lightning barrier looked.That alone could be enough to attract summer moviegoers especially if theyre among the millions of people who already have some attachment to the Warcraft franchise. Theres something to going to the IMAX just to experience loud dumb action and thats amplified if youre able to say ""Dude look thats totally what the Dark Portal looks like in the game""Granted theres also a problem that World of Warcraft fans specifically might have with the Warcraft movie Its set long before the character and events that theyre most familiar with. The famous orc warchief Thrall is only a baby. Theres no tragic tale of Prince Arthas (whos a child at this point in time). There are no night elves no Burning Crusade and so on.But I guess you need something to tackle in sequels right? WARCRAFT (C)Directed by Duncan Jones.

Caption A sampling of recent movies that received one star or less from Washington Post film critics. One star Sid (John Leguizamo) meets a female sloth (Jessie J) in ""Ice Age Collision Course."" Stephanie Merry writes ""Ice Age Collision Course"" the fifth installment in the 14-year-long saga of animated prehistoric animals will with any luck also be the last. Lazy scattershot and excruciatingly unfunny the movie is a hazard to the very young who might come away with the erroneous impression that movies dont get any better than this."" Read the full review. Blue Sky Studios/Twentieth Century Fox Film Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Twenty minutes into ""Warcraft"" viewers will already have been whisked to such fanciful places as Draenor Azeroth Stormwind -- and a castle in the sky. The good news is theres no quiz at the end. The bad news? This convoluted mess of an introduction requires more mental effort than any movie this idiotic deserves. Fans of the video game on which ""Warcraft"" is based presumably already know the complicated history of this mythological world but for frustrated first-timers ""Warcraft"" has some serious splaining to do. This might save you a little trouble Orcs -- muscular monsters with huge hands and underbites that would make an orthodontist see dollar signs -- have accidentally trashed their own planet. Forced to relocate they use dark magic -- fueled by the souls of other species -- to open a portal to the peaceful land of Azeroth. At least Azeroth was peaceful. Its king Llane (Dominic Cooper) is understandably concerned about the giant marauding beasts that have invaded his land so he enlists the help of his brother-in-law the warrior Lothar (Travis Fimmel unintelligibly growling his dialogue) and the kingdoms magical guardian Medivh (Ben Foster channeling a less-subtle Gandalf) to send the Orcs packing. They have some other allies too including an Orc chieftain named Durotan (a motion-captured Toby Kebbell) whos disillusioned with his tribes evil magic Side effects include thousands of dead humans ravaged lands and roid rage. Theres also magician-in-training Khadgar -- played by Ben Schnetzer in what amounts to the only standout performance -- and Garona (Paula Patton) a green-skinned Orc half-breed and escaped slave. In her first appearance shes little more than a Princess Leia knockoff all skimpy clothes and metal leash. Whew. Thats a lot of plot for what is at heart an excuse to go crazy with the green screen. While some of the computer animation is impressive its rarely better than what weve seen in the ""Lord of the Rings"" films or even the recent ""Planet of the Apes"" reboots. Directed by Duncan Jones ""Warcraft"" was in development for years and its release date has been pushed back numerous time. Thats never a good sign. But delays havent helped with generic dialogue bizarre pacing and thin characters. Not even an awkwardly shoehorned love story lightens the mood set by the films bruising battles with combatants getting flung twirled and stampeded by bigger stronger adversaries. Its all so plodding and grim echoed by the blandly percussive score by Ramin Djawadi. After a bone-crushing and byzantine buildup the movie finally peters out. In what passes for resolution the name of the movie is splashed across the screen suggesting that a sequel is the only way to tie up this tangle of loose threads. Thats presumptuous. Heres hoping the next chapter languishes in development hell forever. PG-13. At area theaters.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint I went into ""Warcraft"" knowing nothing about the orcs and humans and dwarves that live in Ironforge or Stormwind or anywhere in the world of Azeroth or the races and clans and magicians that populate its multiple kingdoms. I was not let me admit the target audience for a feature based on Blizzard Entertainments popular ""World of Warcraft"" computer games. I cared even less about the lore of who was who and did what where after viewing it. Being skull-pounded at length by giant photorealistic motion-capture brutes swinging war hammers tends to sap your attention. This grandiose generic non-spectacle spent seven years at the altar of corporate merchandising and fanboy service in development hell. It put me somewhere similar for two hours and walloped acclaimed director Duncan Jones worse still. After his outstanding and original science fiction debuts ""Moon"" and ""Source Code"" his work in this fantasy realm is hackneyed formula at its cheesiest right down to the cliched generic costume design. Jones many fans anticipated this as his version of ""Mad Max Fury Road."" Instead they received this years ""Jupiter Ascending."" You cant blame Jones because he is clearly trying so hard but the result is a huge missed opportunity. The film is about orcs (muscular bigfoot CGI humanoids with wolf ears and pig tusks) who use a space portal to escape their dying world. Medieval-style humans debate moral/political details about killing or making peace with the foreigners. Each sides central characters receive a pinch of sympathy and development. Warcraft  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for extended sequences of intense fantasy violence. Toby Kebbell provides the voice for Durotan an above-board orc chieftain. King Wrynn (Dominic Cooper) and his brother-in-law Cmdr. Lothar (""Vikings"" star Travis Fimmel) are humanitys guardians. Ridiculously exaggerated battle scenes follow them everywhere with the film scoring higher on energetic visual experience than story. The good side of the film is its moments of unintentional comedy. Ben Foster a fine character actor always cast as untrustworthy suspects here plays a sorcerer in service of his trusting king. What a cryptic expression the wizard has -- might he be up to something secretive? Paula Patton tries for a deeper performance as a green-skinned alien babe wearing stripperific battle gear a breed of exotic yet attractive crowd-pleaser since Capt. James Kirk was a cadet. Her Amazon action girl apparently the result of an orc/human union begins as a rather mannish bruiser but gradually becomes more interested in delivering lip locks than blunt trauma. With her Shrek-green pigmentation and mini-tusks her characters increasing human-romantic urges look absurd but Patton performs this very odd beast like someone threatened to kill her pet if she wasnt serious. And shes not even the most surreal female in the story. That goes to Anna Galvins motion-capture performance as the pregnant mate and warrior partner of the films leading orc. With her hugely distended stomach and the body of Hercules big sister the computer-generated big mama is a running accidental joke. Its made even more laughable when she tenderly delivers her little bundle of green joy. The film hustles across its mythical realm at top speed its characters riding griffins giant wolves space portals and teleportation spells. Yet it never seems to arrive anywhere important. Scenes open and close at random like cut scenes from the computer game franchise not key plot points. The kind of character development world building and action staging required for a blockbuster requires the tight focus and wide-arching intelligence of a filmmaker like James Cameron whose ""Avatar"" sequels Im excited to see. ""Warcraft"" is presented as the opening chapter in a franchise but already I feel its time to move on. Were done here.

VPCFantasy flick captures the look but not the tongue-in-cheek charm of the popular video-game franchise.King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper) must make impossible decisions for his people in ""Warcraft.""(Photo Legendary Pictures/Universal Pictures/ILM)Fans of the Warcraft video game series will be geeking out on Friday June 10 when the fantasy franchise leaps from their PC monitors to the big screen as a live-action/motion-capture spectacular. But if any of the uninitiated somehow stumble into the theater theyll see something that looks awfully familiar.Thats because ""Warcraft"" is basically Tolkien on steroids with plenty of muscle but not a lot of brains.Paula Patton stars as half-orc Garona in ""Warcraft."" (Photo Legendary Pictures/Universal Pictures/ILM)I say this not as a hater but as a player. I have lost countless hours battling baddies with my fellow nerds in World of Warcraft the online role-playing game that launched in 2004. But as much as I have enjoyed zipping around the magical lands of Azeroth on my flying carpet (always stopping to pick flowers along the way) one thing I have never paid attention to is the story.AZCENTRALThings To Do app Get the best in events dining and travel right on your deviceYeah yeah another evil mastermind has opened a portal to another world to unleash havoc on the peace-loving Whatevers of Wherever. Shut up and tell me how many harpy feathers I need to collect already.So even though I have clicked through numerous ""conservations"" with some of the characters that are (re)introduced in ""Warcraft"" it was all pretty new to me. Except that its all so old hat.Commander Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel) fights a growing attraction to Garona (Paula Patton) in ""Warcraft."" (Photo Legendary Pictures/Universal Pictures/ILM)The movie directed by Duncan Jones -- who made the excellent sci-fi indie ""Moon"" -- is an origin story for the franchise that began in 1994 with the strategy game ""Warcraft Orcs amp; Humans.""Orcs of course are an ugly brutish race of warriors invented by J.R.R. Tolkien nearly 80 years ago in ""The Hobbit."" The Warcraft version is even bigger and badder -- basically miniature Hulks with green skin tusks dirty loin cloths and battle hammers the size of a Mini Cooper.Their chief-of-chiefs is a leering warlock named Guldan (Daniel Wu wrapped in CGI) master of a form of death magic called the Fel. Having rendered the orcs home world uninhabitable he leads a war band to Azeroth via one of those aforementioned magic portals where he plans to suck the life force out of his human captives in order to bring the entire Horde through.Surrounded by orcs Commander Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel) knows that the battle is far from over in ""Warcraft."" (Photo Legendary Pictures/Universal Pictures/ILM)Charging to the rescue (or flying on hippogriffs as the case may be) are the shiny-armored soldiers of Stormwind led by Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel) with the help of the rebellious young mage Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) and a pretty half-orc (if you dont mind the tusks) named Garona (Paula Patton).Some of these names will be familiar to gamers but none is much of a character just a standard type (stern hero mad genius etc.). The wooden acting doesnt help nor does the hyperbolic dialogue (""In my entire life I have never felt as much pain as I do now"").MORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | PinterestFans will no doubt enjoy the many Easter-egg references to the games including a cameo by an amphibious ""murloc"" and Khadgars strategic use of a polymorph spell (colloquially referred to as ""sheeping""). But one of the best things about World of Warcraft is almost entirely missing here and that is a sense of humor.Young mage Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) evokes ancient magic alongside Commander Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel) in ""Warcraft."" (Photo Legendary Pictures/Universal Pictures/ILM)The game in its current heavily embroidered version isnt merely generic its generic on purpose. In addition to Tolkienian high fantasy it embraces a tongue-in-cheek hodgepodge of geeky tropes from steampunk guns and robots to mystical aliens from outer space. And its packed with sly references to pop culture that make it abundantly clear that the writers and designers dont take themselves too seriously.If only the same were true of ""Warcraft."" But instead it aims to match the mythic gravitas of ""The Lord of the Rings"" -- even throwing in a nod to the Book of Exodus for good measure -- and the results fall paint-by-numbers flat.Reach the reviewer at kerry.lengelarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4896.AZCENTRALWarcraft (2016) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsWarcraft 2 starsDirector Duncan Jones.Cast Travis Fimmel Toby Kebbell Paula Patton Ben Schnetzer.Rating PG-13 for extended sequences of intense fantasy violence. 25 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//azc.cc/1td3FwW More Stories Roberts Pence working to overturn Trumps media ban July 29 2016 1201 p.m. Montini Pence decries name-calling.

Unfortunately he either worked too hard (hes also the co-writer) didnt work hard enough or simply wasnt paying attention. This loud bombastic often incoherent mishmash of magical-themed storytelling simply was not worth whatever effort went into it. While there are some acceptable action sequences its the screenplay -- complicated by some less than inspired performances -- that dooms ""Warcraft"" at every point along the way. I think Id only suggest this film -- and then only hesitantly -- to the legion of fans of this fantasy role-playing video game franchise. The essence of the tale is focused on what will happen to the fictitious world of Azeroth as it faces total destruction from the Orcs a race of creatures who broke through a portal from their own dying world. That dark portal by the way is created by the ""fuel"" that is human prisoners destroyed to make it all happen. Anduin Lothar (played quite lamely by Travis Fimmel) is our hero here -- the liege lord and brother-in-law to his king Llane (Dominic Cooper in one of his more forgettable performances). Also key to the story is an uber-wizard (portrayed by Ben Foster) and his ability to ward off the evil spirit known as ""The Fel."" Among the Orcs there is a code of honor and that leads to a bit of a revolt when one of the good Orc chieftains (Durotan played by Toby Kebbell) comes to realize ""The Fel"" (controlled by the Orc leader Guldan) will eventually lead to the destruction of all living things -- both human and Orc. Among the other notable characters is a half-human half-Orc played by Paula Patton who like her co-stars seemingly phones in her acting job while playing a tough cookie with eyes for Lothar. As noted above the best parts of this film are the CGI action sequences but theres no new ground broken here. Weve seen this all many many many times before. Yet without a strong (or even an adequate) script all the good action scenes in the world are not worth the price of admission. At the end of the film it is made very clear this ""Warcraft"" was expected to spawn a new fantasy franchise. If that happens I would be very surprised given what Ive seen in this first offering. But then Ive been wrong about things like that before. What Im sure of This is NOT worthy of being turned into an ongoing series of films. 1/2 Universal Pictures presents a film directed by Duncan Jones and written by Jones and Charles Leavitt based on the Blizzard Entertainment game.

Itll look something like this massively expensive (160 million) and mostly worthless film version of a role-playing video game thats been losing steam for half a decade. And yet there is not a minute of Warcraft featuring a battle between humans and invading tusk-mouthed orcs in which you cant feel director Duncan Jones straining to bring soul to his computer-generated canvas. Close but no cigar. More News Where Did Alice Through the Looking Glass Go Wrong? Popstar Behind Lonely Islands Hilarious Music Mock-Doc How Superhero Movies Became Too Big To Fail All Stories >> Related Summer Movie Preview 2016 Attack of the Blockbuster Clones Superheroes supervillains sequels semi-reboots -- the scoop on the seasons surprisingly familiar multiplex stunners A word about Jones. His first two films 2009s Moon and 2011s Source Code are minimalist sci-fi gems. How did he get infected by the gigantism of Warcraft? For starters Jones is a lifelong gamer who shared his enthusiasm with his late dad David Bowie. Jones wanted his movie to have heroes and villains on both sides of the war to turn an escapist fantasy on its silly head and fill it with ferocity and feeling. Not happening. Whats onscreen is a godawful mess leaving the actors to suck wind while the film collapses around them. If youve never played the game you might as well watch the movie stoned. (At least you wont feel the pain.) Jones puts his best orc forward. That would be the warrior chief Durotan energetically acted in  motion capture  by Toby Kebbell. The humongous giant gets an aww moment early on when his wife Draka (Anna Galvin) delivers the cutest orc baby. But enough fluff. Durotan tells us in voiceover  ""Our world was dying and I had to find my clan a new home."" That leads Guldan (Daniel Wu) the evil warlock lord of the orcs to open a portal into Azeroth where humans live in peace. Durotan wants to make nice. Guldan doesnt. He wants blood. Its war Durotan has a human mirror-image in Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel of TVs Vikings) a knight who loyally serves his king and queen (Dominic Cooper and Ruth Negga) and worries that his grown son Callan (Burkely Duffield) will die in battle. Lothan still finds time to get it on with Garona (Paula Patton) a half-orc half-human warrior. Patton must play her ridiculous role with green skin and two novelty-store fangs that keep rendering her dialogue unintelligible which might be a blessing given the mouthfuls of expository dialogue cooked up by Jones and co-writer Charles Leavitt. And did I mention Medivh (Ben Foster) the wizard Guardian of Azeroth who also has a son-like protege in Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer one of the films few bright spots) a kid who trusts no one. For good reason. Like Gildan Medivh is siphoning the life force from those he should serve. Who siphoned the life force out of this movie? Did the studio interfere? Was Jones forced to jam a better much longer movie into a two-hour compromise that appears to have been put together by editors using blunt instruments and wearing blindfolds? The result is an indigestible stew that blends Warcraft with elements of Avatar Star Wars Lord of the Rings and every escapist fantasy that ever managed to find an audience. Jones is too good to perish in the ash of this big bombola. Hell live to fight another day. Though the ending begs for a sequel my guess is that this  film franchise wont be so lucky.

A portal to another dimension opens a woman gives birth on the battlefield and hundreds of imprisoned women and children are sacrificed in the name of dark magic. And thats all before the opening credits. ""Warcraft"" is an all-you-can-eat buffet of a movie; at times the film seems singularly designed to enhance the cosplay scene at future comic book conventions. The dialogue is so earnest that its lack of humor becomes a source of humor in itself. The acting is so primal that youll swear a porn sequence is about to break out. And yet theres something refreshing about all of the above. Although ""Warcraft"" is not a great film the movie based on the humans-versus-Orcs video game is a uniquely blunt instrument that makes no apologies or concessions for its straightforward muscularity. Imagine an ""Avengers"" movie in which every hero is the Hulk. Its hard to tell whether director Duncan Jones was being sincere or intentionally pushing even the simplest filmmaking decisions into the realm of comical excess. The answer to that may be in the dialogue which makes little attempt to explain to the non-""Warcraft"" crowd what the hell is going on. A sampling ""Where is he? Where is the protector of Azeroth Where is the guardian?"" ""When the portal opens and the rest of the horde joins us we will give them the Fel"" ""I used the last of my energies to summon you here The guardian has betrayed us"" That last line was uttered by six-time Academy Award nominee Glenn Close who like the rest of us probably had little clue what the heck she was talking about. But thats the beauty of ""Warcraft."" If you know what a Fel is you can explain it to the people sitting next to you in the theater. (Please please dont.) But even if you cant speak ancient Orc the film is literally color-coded. When theres green magic on the screen something bad is happening. And when theres a lot of blue visual effects something good is happening. ""Game of Thrones"" could learn a thing or two ... Jones made the excellent ""Moon"" and solid ""Source Code"" lower-budget films that are nothing like ""Warcraft."" So its a relief that the vision is so assured -- even if that vision is one of nonstop fantasy and carnage. If ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Battlefield Earth"" had a baby it would look like the plot of ""Warcraft."" The movie features a few good-guy Orc warriors raiding and then joining forces with a human realm led by King Wrynn (Dominic Cooper) and his brother-in-law Sir Lothar (Travis Fimmel). Some magicians on both sides screw things up in a quest for power and a hot green half-human Orc female creates some interspecies sexual tension. The design of ""Warcraft"" features constant excess. The armor the humans wear is so big and unwieldy that each man looks like a kindergartner who borrowed his big brothers Boba Fett costume. The Orcs dress in the bones of dead predators and seem to have piercings in their piercings. But the battle scenes are mostly well choreographed and rousing pushing the limits of the PG-13 rating with heads exploding just offscreen and CGI green blood splattering on the camera lens. Theres nothing in ""Warcraft"" that is going to convert the ""Masterpiece Theatre"" or Terrence Malick crowd Run far away from this movie as if an Orc were chasing you with a giant spiked hammer. But it does have that ""Rambo First Blood Part II"" quality with satisfying action that is contained completely in the moment. In a world in which Marvel and DC movies shoot off plot tendrils that intersect with other movies endlessly ""Warcraft"" feels like an original. You pay your money and you watch stuff get smashed. No need to spend an hour on Wikipedia after the movie is over to catch up on the backstory of that X-Men member who was in only two scenes. If there were any hidden filmmaking Easter eggs in this movie they were loaded in a catapult set on fire and fired at a castle wall. Peter Hartlaub is The San Francisco Chronicles pop culture critic.

Share Tweet Definitively establishing that ""state-of-the-art"" and ""chintzy"" are not mutually exclusive qualities Warcraft is a perplexing multiplex boondoggle Rarely is so much time money and cutting-edge technology expended on a spectacle so devoid of wonder. Instead of immersing viewers in its magical realm as most great fantasies do this adaptation of Blizzards wildly popular game series keeps them at an alienating remove. Great effort has been taken to assure that we can see every vertebrate of a dead animal worn like body armor but none seems to have been applied to making the characters come alive the environments seem defined or the special effects look convincing. The film borrows names concepts and even specific locations from its source material all while managing to shrink a limitless multiplayer sandbox--the online kingdom subscribers have been exploring for a dozen years now--into a kind of generic unplayable story mode. Its massive only in budget and miscalculation.True to its roots and in line with the pick-a-side trend in this years blockbuster class Warcraft divides its sympathies. Half the cast of characters--a term to be used loosely when referring to these glowering NPCs--belongs to a species of world-jumping conquerors searching for a new home to replace their dying one. Sporting fashionably braided hair and pierced tusks the hulking orcs are basically Klingons on steroids--they have codes of honor raise their young to be warriors etc. Of course theyre really just unconvincing masses of ones and zeroes; even the magic of motion-capture cant make these macho beasts look real exactly. This becomes a problem when were meant to be bonding with blandly brooding orc chieftain--and nervous new father--Durotan (Toby Kebbell) who suspects that the power-hungry shaman he answers to may be poisoning every land they claim with his black magic.The humans playing defense against these invaders are more distinguishable but no more interesting than their marauding counterparts. One-dimensional archetypes abound from the rakish commander (Travis Fimmel) to the noble king (Dominic Cooper) to a nerdy bookish mage in training (Ben Schnetzer). Ben Foster cast in the Merlin role (but dressed and groomed more like Jesus) spends most of the film pretending to summon and hurl clouds of gaseous green energy. (His magic mojo comes from some intangible fuel cell called The Fell which is basically The Force if it corrupted as surely as the one true ring.) Its not the most dignified use of a terrific actor though Foster fares much better than Paula Patton taking the Zoe Saldana career path of slathering herself in a primary color to play an inhuman warrior princess--in this case the probable offspring of an orc and human fling. The film cant even make her fanged underbite look natural let alone settle on a consistent forced-perspective scale.To watch Warcraft is never to be transported but to wade through a thick morass of mythology exposition gaudy light-show effects half-assed character development and formulaic franchise groundwork. Its bad news for fans of the game much worse news for director/cowriter Duncan Jones (Moon Source Code) a talented sci-fi fabulist whos fallen screaming into the same CGI abyss that consumed Peter Jackson during his unfortunate Hobbit cycle. The film builds perhaps inevitably to one of those tiresome clashes of digital armies as two waves of fuzzy soldiers crash into each other. In a way though it feels like were always watching expendable computer-generated avatars even when theyre captured in close-up or having tedious conversations about a potential truce between man and monster. Nothing in Jones green-screen kingdom looks tactile not even the flesh-and-blood performers. It makes you long for the dirt and mud and tangible stuff of an analog-era Lord Of The Rings ripoff like Willow.Yet to snidely dismiss all of this as the soulless epitome of ""video-game cinema"" would be to insult not just video games but also the more relentlessly disposable entertainments that usually earn that description For all its swinging swords and mallets Warcraft is less an action movie than a dour medieval soap opera built from the spare parts of older better fantasias. The games--not just the flagship World Of Warcraft but also its real-time strategy predecessors--were no less indebted to other sources from steampunk to Tolkien to Dungeons amp; Dragons. Its the players who give these tropes distinctive life using derivative building blocks to create custom characters adventures and experiences. By its very nature Warcraft the movie cant replicate that participatory element. But with apologies to Jones--fingers crossed that he bounces back from this folly--you cant help but wish someone with a bolder grander vision was manning the mouse. All anyone here saw in the raw material was an untapped franchise less a world of Warcraft then a biannual summer appointment.

Movie Review    Warcraft with Dominic Cooper Travis Fimmel Paula Patton Toby Kebbell. Directed by Duncan Jones from a screenplay by Jones and Charles Leavitt. 123 minutes. Rated PG-13 for extended sequences of intense fantasy violence. Several theaters. And in the nearer term theres ""The BFG"" aka Big Friendly Giant. Kind of ugly but kindly nonetheless.

And glowering eyes staring angrily forth from a very large head. Were talking orcs here. Demonic monsters of the ""Lord of the Rings"" world appropriated and repurposed by the makers of the vastly popular ""Warcraft"" fantasy video game. Theyre central characters in the game now the source material of a Major Motion Picture -- which is an incoherent mess a riot of cheesy-looking CG and a desert in terms of character development. In it the inhabitants of orc world a place of dust and brutishness pour through a glowing green portal into the world of humankind a place of walled cities and castles and knights in shining armor. The monsters goal domination and decimation of the easily squishable humans. Let the CG battles courtesy of director Duncan Jones and an army of keyboard warriors begin. Prominently in play are what Ill call Dueling Force Fields light-show creations of blue and green zaps zapping from characters hands and eyes hurling various characters hither and yon like rag dolls as they bounce off the electricity. The prime zappers are a couple of hooded wizardlike villains parallel paragons of treachery. One is an orc (Daniel Wu) and one a human (Ben Foster) whose eyes literally glow with malevolence. A knight played by Travis Fimmel with a weird little smirk is the chief human hero. Theres a good-guy orc (Toby Kebbell) who wants to form an alliance with humans and suffers badly for his apostasy. Paula Patton playing a half-orc half-human female warrior is the most sympathetic character and actually gives something approaching a fully fledged performance but for the rest of it ... ugliness as far as the eye can see.

But director Duncan Jones does his best to make this video-game adaptation feel alive. Amy Nicholson 06/08/2016 TheAmyNicholson The first thing you have to forgive about the Warcraft movie is the orc teeth. Imagine a playground of bullies with underbites. The orc women have dainty lower jaw-fangs designed to snag their top lip. Their male mates swing around thumb-size tusks heavy with rings and pierced hoops. When a fighter dies his tooth is snapped off and strung on a necklace. Alive and in 3-D their plaque-fuzzed incisors stab at the audience. Itd be scarier if we werent wondering how they brush. From the neck down it gets worse. The orcs wear dirty warthog skulls for shoulder pads line their backs with skeleton spines sprout thick fingernails and carry a coating of grimy crust that sticks to their skin like dried peanut butter. As human Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel) grimaces if orcs are around you can tell by the smell. And yet orc chieftain Durotan (Toby Kebbell) has kind green eyes. And yet when hes in bed with his pregnant orc wife (Anna Galvin) they cuddle and crack jokes and punch each other in the shoulder like teenagers. And yet you suddenly care about their marriage even though she and Durotan are literally capturing and killing human beings to fuel a magical portal built cyclically for the purpose of capturing and killing more human beings. And yet though we were happy to skip orc wars after the last three Hobbit movies though every cell in our body is rolling its eyes were in. And yet and yet and yet. Theres every reason to snigger at Warcraft or avoid it altogether. I cant blame you. People who dont play the hugely popular video game have no hunger for yet another fantasy land populated with wizards and kings where every proper name was either invented by refrigerator poetry -- Frostwolf Bronzebeard Stormwind Doomhammer -- or by scattering Scrabble tiles and shrugging ""Yeah Medivh works."" Fans of Warcraft love it because they control their own plots. But every few minutes director Duncan Jones (Moon Source Code) who cowrote the script with Charles Leavitt thinks to put in strange fresh beats -- a character out of breath a tiny stumble an unexpected line delivery -- that combined do the impossible. They make this standard shopworn CG-plated epic feel like its own monster. Universal PicturesThats all Jones. When he took over the script it was the same old ""man good orcs bad"" smash-em-up. The theaters are full of flicks where the heroes are perfect (or adorkably perfect) and the villains are evil just because. Warcraft adds a wrinkle. It spends as much time with the orcs as it does with the humans long enough to empathize with their cultures devotion to honor and loyalty. We see orcs begin to question their warlord Blackhand (Clancy Brown) especially when magician Guldan (Daniel Wu) casually vapes slaves for an energy buzz. And when the film cuts back to the humans theyre doing the same thing wondering if theyre trusting the right leaders and struggling with hollow patriotic deaths. In the climactic battle scenes we know everyones conflicted motivations even the grunts in the back who live only to be smashed. We understand their actions as if we were holding the joystick. Yet the camera makes it clear that Jones is in control. Instead of the top-down view of player-gods the movie cuts us down to size. The characters tower over the lens stomping past us as we cower at their knees and smashing fists in our faces to cut to black. My ears rang. I liked it. Still the screen is so alive its unnerving. There are a few shots that spend four whole seconds soaking in a vista -- mostly the orcs village a tent city under a wooden roller coaster -- but otherwise the movie wont stop moving as the camera dodges hammers ducks horses and grabs onto a griffins tailfeathers. Warcrafts fidgetiness almost distracts from the mediocre animation. For the love of god I dont want to see another glowing eyeball until I rewatch The NeverEnding Story. (Goofy finger electricity you can stay.) If it kept us more flustered we could even forgive the miscast performances like Ben Fosters twerpy wizard and his chubby-cheeked understudy (Ben Schnetzer) who looks more like an overwhelmed law student. Few actors can handle the green screen. Two big moments get drained by flat reactions and even buried under pixels Kebbells orc hunk out-emotes every other human face. At least Fimmels fierce human fighter is a worthy Tom Hardy knockoff. As a bonus you can actually understand his dialogue. Still the main problem for this daffy blockbuster is that orcs arent cool. It happens. Genre flicks go through trends Wizards cede power to vampires who get overrun by zombies who get schooled by superheroes. No wonder Warcraft wanted to make this movie a decade ago. Post-Hobbit its passe. Audiences are fickle but at least were consistently so. (Hot chicks in body paint like Paula Pattons Garona never go out of style though itd be great if they did.) If the franchise survives to shoot a sequel -- and there are plot twists here that genuinely make me wish it would -- perhaps the mood will be friendlier. And even if not heres hoping Warcraft continues being its own odd beast.

"Warcraft is an ambitious wipeout (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Warcraft is an ambitious wipeout (PG-13) Director Duncan Jones adaptation of the popular computer game is high on spectacle but low on substance. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com6/8/2016 Editor rating 1.5 Warcraft the film adaptation of the 1994 Blizzard Entertainment computer game that spawned several sequels (including the massive hit World of Warcraft) throws so many realms and characters at you in its first 15 minutes -- Azeroth Draenor Guldan Durotan -- even George R.R. Martin would beg for mercy.Heres the thing though The moment you stop trying to figure out whats what and whos who the movie becomes easy to follow because all the fancy names and references are just window dressing on a plot so simple it could pass for a childrens book. Devoted Warcraft fans will take pleasure in seeing this dense beloved universe brought to life via the most impressive motion-capture effects since Avatar. The orcs a race of towering mostly green-skinned brutes who sport gnarly tusks and wield huge war hammers have such expressive eyes and faces you buy them as real creatures (the two main orcs are played by Toby Kebbell and Clancy Brown). Theyre so impressive they highlight how bad the performances by their human co-stars are. Director Duncan Jones who previously made the minimalist sci-fi drama Moon and the time-travel mind bender Source Code seems to have been in over his head at the reins of this massive 160 million production. He has devoted so much attention to the technical aspects of the film -- some of the orcs sport bling and piercings on their tusks -- that he didnt notice how badly his human cast was flailing.The people in Warcraft are all standard fantasy-genre types -- the dutiful warrior (Travis Fimmel) the benevolent king (Dominic Cooper) the ornamental queen (Ruth Negga) the powerful wizard (Ben Foster) the studious apprentice (Ben Schnetzer) -- without any distinguishing characteristics. The actors who spent much of their time on the set acting opposite green screens seem bored and more than a little bewildered (with the exception of Foster whose odd drunk performance is out of place and strangely comical like Marlon Brando in The Island of Dr. Moreau).Paula Patton plays the most intriguing character a half-orc who fights on the side of the humans as they try to prevent the orcs from invading their world via a magical portal. But the script co-written by Jones and Charles Leavitt is filled with so much deadly dialogue no actor could save it ""In my entire life I have never felt so much pain as I do now"" or ""If love is what you need you must be willing to travel to the ends of the earth to find it""  Glenn Close pops up in a cameo mostly to deliver the ominous warning ""No one can stand against the darkness ... alone."" And so on.Warcraft isnt a flat-out disaster like Battlefield Earth or David Lynchs Dune The movie contains some impressive setpieces such as a surprise forest ambush by the orcs and the film wisely spends more time exploring the cultural and political ideologies of the monsters (who are not all evil) than it does hanging around the dull king and his court. The orcs have a great physicality to them -- when they swing their giant hammers you can feel their weight -- and the climax piles so many cliffhangers on top of each other than you cant resist a smile The movie may not work but it certainly tries hard. (I did wish Jones had thrown in a scene showing the orcs with those gnarly teeth eating dinner; their army is so big theyd need an entire ranch of cattle to get through a single week).Warcraft would be easy to relegate to the bargain bin of 1980s B-grade guilty-pleasure fantasy pictures such as Krull or Yor the Hunter from the Future except that the games popularity guarantees a healthy international box office haul (it has already grossed 46 million in China in one day alone) and the entire movie is structured as the opening chapter of a much longer saga. The story doesnt end so much as stop leaving enough plot threads dangling for at least two sequels. The Warcraft hardcore can rejoice. Everyone else can move along. Theres not much to see here.

Where to even begin? How about here Sitting through Warcraft is like being bludgeoned on the head with a Dungeons amp; Dragons Monster Manual for 123 minutes. The big hardcover one. Terrible even by the low standard of videogame-to-movie adaptations Duncan Jones 3-D action-fantasy endurance test is a cautionary tale of what can happen when Hollywood blindly chases after popular properties in the hopes of minting the next blockbuster franchise. When it works the studio gets rich and the fans are respected and rewarded. When it doesnt you get the next Speed Racer or Jonah Hex or Lone Ranger -- which is exactly what Warcraft will end up becoming. Its soulless incoherent Renaissance Faire hooey. And since the latest iteration of game series that inspired it World of Warcraft already peaked years ago even the timing is off. For the uninitiated the story chronicles the origins of a bloody interspecies clash between humans and orcs--a hulking he-man race of warriors with pointy gremlin ears tusk-like bicuspids and ropy Predator braids. They look like Klingons who swallowed Conan the Barbarian and Hellboy. While the orcs are ruled by an evil leader named Guldan (Daniel Wu) theyre not all savages. One in particular a big-hearted brute called Durotan (Toby Kebbell) is quickly established as a devoted husband and father after his orc wife Draka (Anna Galvin) gives birth to a baby orc who coos like a shorn Furby. Needless to say Durotans not down with Guldan and is conflicted by his plan to unleash his orc horde through a shimmering portal and attack the puny humans who are even less defined as characters than their orc tormentors. Vikings Travis Fimmel plays the wisecracking hero Lothar (I kept waiting for Rick Moranis to show up to say whether he was the Gatekeeper or the Key Master) Dominic Cooper is the bland King Llayne and poor Ben Foster pops up as the magical Medivh. (Is there a better actor choosing worse roles right now?) They all stand around stiffly mumbling Tolkien-esque jibberish about boomsticks spellthrowers Golems and something called ""The Fel"" which seems to be really important but I couldnt tell you why. Caught in between these two warring tribes is Paula Pattons Garona a green-skinned human-orc ""half-breed"" whos almost unintelligible since she seems to have a pair of plastic novelty Halloween fangs in her mouth. Maybe she explained what The Fel was. As the orcs and the humans scheme and do battle director and co-writer Jones waves his CGI wand like a cudgel pounding the audience into numb submission. Its a relentlessly depressing experience. Not simply because the movie is bad--there are plenty of bad movies--but because Jones has been such a promising filmmaker. His two previous efforts 2009s Moon and 2011s Source Code were both insanely clever stories made with modest budgets and crackerjack craftsmanship. But Warcraft is so enormous he probably lost his grip on the kind of movie he was trying to make--and who he was making it for. Perhaps he was too close to it. Maybe being such an avowed fan of the videogame made Jones too nearsighted to translate its universe and what makes it so interesting to a broader audience. Thats why hardcore fans rarely make effective missionaries. Their zeal is too narrow to convert anyone to their cause. Its also why sitting through Warcraft feels like youre watching a foreign film without subtitles...and with the reels in the wrong order. The storytelling is ham-fisted and silly the characters are dull and unmemorable and despite its massive budget the special effects look cheap and cheesy. Worst of all Warcraft is basically two hours of set-up for a sequel that may never happen and one youd probably skip anyway.

Here she is in Warcraft. Courtesy Universal Pictures A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - In 2001 a friend a grown-up saw The Fellowship of the Ring more than a dozen times in the theater. Sometimes shed leave with a half-hour left. ""I just needed to get to Galadriel and Lothlorien"" she told me. She didnt need all the climactic fighting.In 2012 I took my mother to see the baggy dithering first installment of the Hobbit trilogy. Afterwards she scoffed at the critics proclaiming ""I was happy to spend so much time in that world without all the beat-em-ups.""For many of the millions who love it fantasy can be a refuge -- not a quick escape from this world but the opportunity to luxuriate in another. Sadly they wont find much world to sink into in Warcraft the 3-D adaptation of the computer-game series whose online role-playing edition marked the greatest monetization yet of the addictive game concepts Gary Gygax and David Arneson invented with Dungeons amp; Dragons kill monsters get loot grow more powerful kill bigger monsters. The movie makes you yearn for real life even as its camera swoops you through spectacular dwarf forges ivory cities throne rooms and wizards towers.Warcraft dashes through its HD renderings so fast that details merely slough the eye. Other than one shot of a wizard naif gaping at a circular staircase the filmmakers expect you to pause Warcraft at home if you want to see what its army of artists actually designed. (And seriously the capital is called Stormwind City? Who names their town after an A+ reason not to live there?)Fans of the beat-em-ups will be even more miserable. Warcraft plods toward its climactic battle like Sisyphus shoving that stone up Hells hill -- youll abandon hope of it ever getting there. Its the kind of day-killer of a movie that just before the third act shackles its heroes in prison cells. Is there any viewer who doesnt know theyll eventually escape and that the lockup scenes are the best possible time to go to the bathroom? The Warcraft games emphasize in different iterations both strategic city-sacking and the jolly dungeon-delving party-based adventuring of Damp;D. The movie cant even get those basics right confining its battles to a forest a campground by a portal and the patio area of a wizards indoor pool.In short Warcraft is the most wearying kind of bad movie a dull and sad one thats less engaging a watch than just seeing the studios millions run bill by bill through a shredder for two hours. Ten more reels of Bilbo Bagginss singing-dancing dwarf dinner party would play like Raiders of the Lost Ark by comparison. Its pompous and grim and confusing set in an imperiled fantasy land -- Azeroth -- that may as well be named Generica. Key scenes seem to have been sliced away or never filmed. An hour had passed before I felt confident I could tell in a lineup which bearded fellow was king which was wizard and which was warrior. Their common trait besides general indistinguishability Theyre all awfully quick to give speeches to chain-bound half-orc slave Garona about how hard their lives have been. EXPAND At least the direwolves are doing OK in Azeroth. Courtesy Universal Pictures But Paula Patton as that half-orc has quite a high charisma score. Garonas torn between two worlds as the back cover of the novelization might say but Patton finds feeling and humor in the ridiculous role. She scores the films only honest laughs when she bluntly tells that wizard naif that he would be an ineffective lover. In the final scenes Garona even gets to make a tense difficult decision and Warcraft briefly seems to have hot blood in its veins.There are a few other elements that might interest devotees of fantasy cheese. First the filmmakers honor the games multivarious perspectives by casting an orc (Toby Kebbell) as Warcrafts first onscreen hero -- and depicting orc marriage with big-lug tenderness. These scenes arent good exactly but theyre the only ones in the film that suggest that anyone in Azeroth (or the orc world invading it) has ever felt anything besides go-here/fight-that. The mo-cap work is expressive and convincing with more care spent on each brutish orc nipple than on the entirety of the script. Kebbell rumbles dutifully in the role but the performance and the technical achievement are defeated by the creature design Why do the orcs have such huge and ill-proportioned Hamburger Helper hands? More pleasing for fans of this kind of thing is Warcrafts spirited and inventive (for a movie) depiction of magic. Its here that you might see why a director as promising as Duncan Jones (Moon Source Code) signed on for this -- in the margins he finds room to play. Theres shivery horror in the way an orc shaman sucks the white-light life out of his chattel and bad-guy magery is always marked with plumes of necromantic green. A wizard hero meanwhile rains lightning down on a small squad of enemies and the sequence is more scary and satisfying than anything Thors ever done onscreen -- the forces unleashed seem just barely controlled.Finally I have to give Warcraft this It inspired the most impassioned profane heckle Ive heard at a movie screening since the time a young man hollered out as War Horse climaxed ""Its just a fucking horse"" This time the shout came forty minutes in after the excitable preview audience had settled into fitful silence. As characters whose names I couldnt keep straight jawed at each other through their beards a real person yelled ""Fuck this boring white shit"" and barreled right out of the theater.

Yes its nice when good artists get big paychecks for superhero flicks or action pictures (especially when they use those salaries to subsidize other edgier projects). But buying into that world often means selling out - or at least paying a price. Take smart sci-fi director Duncan Jones. He made the terrific low-budget ""Moon."" Then he was given more money and made the less startling but still unusual ""Source Code."" So then he was given even more money to make the blockbuster adaptation ""Warcraft."" And he might as well have just thrown the camera in a mudpit and burned the budget in the parking lot. A hugely popular role-playing fantasy factory of dungeons dragons and computer games the original ""World of Warcraft"" took some half-remembered Tolkien stripped away any literary heft or spiritual meaning and reduced it to an endlessly violent orgy of heavily muscled men battling even more heavily muscled ""orcs."" The orcs - another borrowing from Tolkien by the way -- are basically goblin warriors. Theyre also frankly ridiculous looking with tusks jutting up from their lower jaws and ludicrously disproportionate arms and fists. (Oh and just to further assuage masculine inadequacies theyre at least three times the size of their female mates). Got it? Good. Because Jones film - which heaven help us all is clearly conceived as a curtain-raiser for a multi-episode ""Warcraft"" movie series - then sets out to tell us how the fearsome orcs and the usual fairy-tale collection of humans wizards and dwarves went to war. MORE A few words with Duncan Jones It seems that the nasty greedy orcs have already used up their own planets resources - and their exalted poobah has found a magical portal. Simply feed it with the lives of weaker creatures and you can move on to the next world. And once youve ruined it just feed it further with that worlds conquered masses and move on to the next. It sounds a lot like gentrification and given the look of the orcs - theyre very big on dreds piercings and tattoos - it does occasionally feel as if were in Williamsburg. But then we meet the humans and we have corny characters with names like King Llane Khadgar and Medivh. Theres even a Lothar (although - sorry 60s music buffs - he is not accompanied by his Hand People). Admitted the action is well-staged and some of the sets are interesting. Jones still has an eye. But the movie is so overwhelmingly digitalized that most of it looks like a cartoon. Even when living breathing actors are on screen they feel computer generated. As a mystic with blue light shooting out of his eyes Ben Foster continues on his mission to convince American critics that overacting is just better acting (sadly he seems to be winning). As a fetching ""half-breed"" orc/human slave Paula Patton sports bones in her hair and half a pair of plastic Halloween fangs. Travis Fimmel and Dominic Cooper play two of our nominally human heroes. Oh and theres also a ""good"" orc called Durotan which sounds like something Snooki used to spray on herself and a giant golem (which is actually a Jewish legend not a pagan one but what the hell). And Glenn Close shows up for some reason as a witchy character named Alodi taking a paycheck but skipping a screen credit. So at least one person onscreen was thinking. I admit I was never a big fan of ""World of Warcraft"" and its eldritch ilk; Ive been told that Duncan Jones is. So why didnt he realize that its the flexibility of that gaming world - the ability to become any character choose any path - that drives its appeal? That no matter how much money they threw at it a ""Warcraft"" movie was a lousy idea to begin with? Jones is an intelligent man a smartly visual director and a genre fan. And the very best any sci-fi and fantasy devotee can hope for right now is that ""Warcraft"" disappears into a black hole of failure so huge you could chuck ""The Green Lantern"" ""John Carter"" ""Fantastic Four"" and even ""Battlefield Earth"" right in after it. That the entire affair becomes such an embarrassment that the ""Warcraft"" franchise is dead on arrival. That the next time Jones makes a fantasy movie -- hes got one in pre-production -- he once again has to shoot with a tiny cast a couple of sets and hardly any budget. Because when he does? Ill be first in line to see it. Warcraft (PG-13) Universal (123 min.) Directed by Duncan Jones. With Travis Fimmel Paula Patton Ben Foster Dominic Cooper. Now playing in New Jersey.

VPCTravis Fimmel and Paula Patton star in the movie adaptation of Warcraft.(Photo Universal Pictures) Corrections amp; clarifications An earlier version of this review misidentified the capital city of Azeroth.No need to have ever played a video game to enjoy Warcraft though a healthy affection for swashbuckling action and throwback fantasy probably helps.Director Duncan Jones adventurous adaptation ( out of four; rated PG-13; in theaters Friday) of the popular role-playing game doesnt have the expansive nature or deep mythology -- at least not yet -- of Peter Jacksons The Lord of the Rings series but Warcraft wins by not trying to be the second coming of a 10-hour cinematic trip through Mordor with Hobbits and jewelry. Rather its a simpler yet still wholly entertaining tale of magic and larger-than-life soldiers in a battle for survival.USA TODAYWarcraft aims to level up the video-game movieThanks to the black magic wielded by their wicked leader Guldan (played through motion capture by Daniel Wu) the world populated by war-loving barbarian orcs is dying. As a result they travel through a interdimensional gate to the human realm of Azeroth to take over.Young mage Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) gets a whiff of trouble and warns King Llane (Dominic Cooper) and his military guru Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel).

(Photo Universal Pictures)But like his iconic dad David Bowie Jones has an impressive knack for elevating material as the director did with his man-in-space picture Moon and sci-fi mystery Source Code. Jones infuses Warcraft with themes of tolerance and identity but also a similar sense of fun and wonder as Krull The NeverEnding Story and others did in the campy 80s fantasy boom.Lothar is an earnest individual but Fimmel gives him a snarky side that plays well against the inherent clumsiness of Khadgar and the fish-out-of-water nature of Garona (Paula Patton) a half-orc warrior with whom hes tied in a potential romantic dynamic. However Jones upends even that cliche in insightful fashion.USA TODAYWarcraft was a fantasy for Travis Fimmel Paula PattonThe computer-generated landscape of Azeroth is mighty fine yet it is tough to get your bearings on whether youre in the city of Stormwind or the magical city of Dalaran as folks scoot between them frequently on the road to foiling Guldans treacherous plans. And many of the CGI orcs while well crafted tend to look the same in attacking packs.A standout in that lineup -- and of the movie in general -- is Durotan one of the orc chieftains given life through Toby Kebbells motion-capture work. With a heart almost as big as his barrel chest Durotan is an unlikely hero who rebels against Guldan in order to protect his fellow warrior wife (Anna Galvin) and their newborn baby. Kebbells performance showcases the nuances of a father gripped by the no-win situation of having no home and his family in constant danger.With Warcraft kin is mightier than the sword. 161 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 7 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1Xaqhux,http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/06/08/review-warcraft-movie/85560830/,200,warcraft34,warcraft,usatoday

Orcs rampage through a convoluted storyline in an adaptation of the popular fantasy video game series. Director Duncan Jones. (203). PG-13 CGI violence. Area theaters. Somebody should have put this script to the sword. Perhaps fans of the fantasy role-playing video game series on which ""Warcraft"" opening Friday is based will care about the fate of the realm of Azeroth as it is overrun by orcs out to launch a dark portal that is powered by life force out of their human prisoners. But if that over-stuffed sentence alone makes you want to stuff two twenty-sided dice in your ears then consider yourself warned this is not ""Lord of the Rings."" Its barely ""Dungeons amp; Dragons."" In ""Warcraft"" heroic warrior Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel) the wizard Medivh (Ben Foster) the honorable orc Durotan (Toby Kebbell) and the noble King Llane (Dominic Cooper) are well known to gamers who have spent hours online immersed in that dense backstory. Mainstream audiences trying to wade through all that exposition though may feel like their own life force is being drained. Paula Patton provides a little humanity under heavy makeup as a half-orc named Garona. Daily News 2016 summer movie guide Dear Mr. Fantasy Travis Fimmel charges into the CGI-heavy scrum in ""Warcraft."" (Photo Credit Legendary Pictures) Much like the orc leader Guldan who becomes addicted to the foul magic known as ""the Fel"" director Duncan Jones has been bewitched by the availability of a large CGI budget and over-indulges on the kinetic visuals. Jones who is David Bowies son has proven to be too good a filmmaker on his first two sci-fi movies -- ""Moon"" (2009) and ""Source Code"" (2011) -- to be judged by this blip on his resume. He certainly crafted some deft action scenes along the way on his three-year heros journey to get this gigantic film to the screen. Toby Kebbell provides some performance capture magic as an orc. (Photo Credit Legendary Pictures) And no director to date has managed a good video adaptation because just having a rich setting is not the same as having a rich story. Those who dont remember the fake history of ""Prince of Persia Sands of Time"" are doomed to repeat it. As the third climactic battle scene ends with the promise of a sequel its clear that studio execs went into ""Warcraft"" expecting to craft a franchise. Talk about living in a fantasy world.

David Ehrlich Jun 2 2016 247 pm davidehrlich Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk ""Warcraft"" ""Warcraft"" is a once-in-a-generation disaster one of the most ill-advised and ill-conceived studio films of this modern blockbuster era but you have to give Universal some credit for trying. At a time when films of this scale are defined by safety and defenestrated by compromise -- at a time when blockbusters are rigorously engineered to appeal to the broadest possible audience -- Universal went all-in on a summer movie so niche and nerdy that it makes ""Willow"" look like ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" look like ""Masterpiece Theatre."" Adapted from Blizzard Entertainments massively popular computer game series of the same name and resulting from a visionary deal that Universal forged with the software giant more than a decade ago (long before ""Avatar"" confirmed the potential upside of such a gamble) the film once seemed poised to bridge the seemingly uncrossable gap between movies and video games. Years passed without any evidence that the project was actually pushing forward but a steady drip of exciting production news helped sustain interest. When director Sam Raimi dropped out he was replaced with Duncan Jones (""Moon"") a talented young director with real credibility and a deep-seated passion for the material. When ""The Force Awakens"" crowded the films release date Universal confidently repositioned ""Warcraft"" as an early summer tentpole. Now 10 years and several directors after it was first announced ""Warcraft"" is finally here and not only does it fail to bridge the gap between movies and video games it self-immolates and swan-dives into the void illuminating a dark rift thats even deeper than it is wide. A grotesque funhouse reflection of modern blockbuster cinema the film is truly a staggering failure and theres no joy to be found in its profound awfulness -- an exciting director has burned off several of his best years a major Hollywood studio has been punished for their ambition and two disparate mediums have exposed the worst in each other. Presented in garish 3D so vivid that viewers can practically feel the movie losing money in real time ""Warcraft"" unfolds as though a Dungeon Master were narrating a very expensive episode of ""Drunk History."" Essentially a feature-length prequel save for its first two minutes the film opens with growly narration about how humans and orcs have always been at war and then jumps back in time to illustrate how the two species first came into contact. ""Warcraft"" Orcs for those unfamiliar with the videogame franchise are a species of steroidal homunculi warriors who live by a savage code that seems incongruous with their posh British accents. A nomadic people who rove between worlds as a collective ""horde"" these motion-captured monstrosities have braided hair giant hammers and protruding molars (which they pierce with rings). The ones who have lines are white and the ones who exist as fodder for the action scenes are green -- while this dichotomy almost certainly causes some kind of racial discord in the orc community its also our only means of telling these things apart. The orcs are supposedly a smart species but they have yet to invent t-shirts nor can they seem to figure out why every world they inhabit seems to start dying after their obviously evil wizard leader (Daniel Wu as the power-mad Guldan) drains the land for fuel. On one hand its hard to respect the intelligence of the orcs when they fail to see that Guldan -- who has glowing green eyes and feeds his magic portal by literally siphoning the souls of his slaves -- is pure evil. On the other hand the orcs blind allegiance to power is one of their most recognizably human qualities. And Jones script which he co-wrote with Charles Leavitt is nothing if not focused on the orcs underlying humanity. Our first proper introduction to their way of life is an appreciably tender moment in which a bland warrior named Durotan (""Fantastic Four"" star Toby Kebbell) is goofing around with his pregnant wife Draka (Anna Galvin) in the privacy of their war hut. Theres nothing like watching a weightless humanoid CG wildebeest use his massive hand to caress his mates swollen belly. Of course a scene like this one only exists to heighten the stakes of the set piece that follows and Guldan has quite a spectacle in store for us The hunchbacked mystic having exhausted the hordes current planet plans to open a massive portal through which he will lead his army to the realm of Azeroth (a verdant place full of humans who can be used as kindling for whatever dark shenanigans Guldan gets up to next). And so Guldan leads Durotan Draka and some other indistinguishable digital cretins into Azeroth inciting a needlessly convoluted war between orcs and humans. READ MORE Duncan Jones on How He Models His Career After Christopher Nolan The films human hero is somehow even less interesting than his orc counterpart. Like someone took a still photo of Aragorn and faxed it to another franchise Lothar (Travis Fimmel) is a military man with rangy hair and a glinty smile that says ""Im the least ridiculous-looking person here so I guess Im the protagonist?"" Compared to the empty and uninspired Lothar ""Avatar"" protagonist Jake Scully feels like he fell out of a Dickens novel. When a dorky young mage named Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) warns Lothar that the orcs have spilled into Azeroth the two men race to consult the reclusive wizard Medivh (Ben Foster delivering a performance so big that it can probably be seen from space). He divines what we already know War is coming. Bridging the gap between the two factions is a half-orc half-human woman named Garona (Paula Patton) who Lothar frees from Guldans grasp. Painted green and sporting a set of plastic Halloween fangs on the wrong half of her teeth Patton consistently looks like shes about to lose a cos-play contest for her own character. But the most troubling thing about Garona isnt her cheap aesthetic or her flat affect or even the fact that the films plot would be almost completely unchanged if she were erased from it entirely. No the most troubling thing about Garona is that a human man had sex with a female orc in order to bring her into this world (even the ""Warcraft"" community is confused about her lineage and yet the film bafflingly assumes that it wont be a problem for newcomers). ""Warcraft"" Garonas inexplicable parentage -- which is fun to mock but impossible to ignore -- epitomizes the incoherent nature of the films fantasy world. Jones and co. assumed the unenviable task of chiseling a coherent adventure film from a dizzyingly dense mythology but the degree of difficulty cant excuse the degree of failure. Whereas ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" baked the myths of Middle Earth into every frame and -- following Tolkiens expert lead -- allowed viewers to discover its secrets along with its sheltered characters ""Warcraft"" unfolds like a feature-length version of a ""Previously on Game of Thrones"" package blitzing through the plot as though the movies only task was to remind viewers of a story they already knew. Theres no denying that fans of the franchise will find more to enjoy here than newcomers but while familiarity may help lessen the confusion of some plot details no degree of goodwill for the games will compensate for the sloppiness of the storytelling. For a movie that mostly takes place in three generic locations its almost impressive how poorly each scene connects to the next as character motivations (and character identities) soon smudge into nonsense. For a film that had the time and resources to pave over any potholes the only logical explanation for a disaster of this magnitude is that everyone involved lost sight of what they were making. Perhaps ""Warcraft"" is an argument against the idea that fans are the best people to help shepherd their beloved properties to the screen; whereas many of the most incompetent recent blockbusters have been directed by untested special effects gurus Jones has proven his bonafides. ""Moon"" and ""Source Code"" are the work of an intelligent filmmaker who has an innate gift for mining rich characters from high-concept premises. For someone so skilled to create something this bad either he was overwhelmed by the scale of the project or he was too invested in the lore to understand how it needed to be reimagined for an audience who may not share his knowledge or enthusiasm. This is truly a depressing experience. Its rare to feel such pity for a major studio movie but watching ""Warcraft"" bend over backwards to set up a sequel is like watching a desperate paramedic apply CPR to someone whos clearly been dead for hours. Hes gone. Hes gone. Let it go. Let the battle between orcs and humans end in a stalemate. Call off the fighting and implore both sides to return to their loved ones. Bad movies come and go -- ""Warcraft"" is a tragedy. Grade F ""Warcraft"" opens in theaters on Friday June 10.

An F? REALLY? Youre a joke. Reply TrueBlue June 3 2016 356 am When I had to look up a word from this writers second sentence. I could tell I was in for a Review that promised Trolling and Epic Fail at the same time. Say it out loud ""Dee- Fen- est-rate"".. that just rolls off the tongue. How about ""Castrated by Compromise"". I think your readers atleast have seen that word before. I wont go on anymore. What Id say Im sure is said by my brethren. Give the movie a chance for Gods sake; this isnt about you getting attention by forcing it to sound like its the worst fail in years.......John Carter... sorry I had to atleast say one. Reply Alex June 3 2016 425 pm You needed to look up defenestration? What grade are you in? Reply Brian Williamson June 20 2016 946 pm Really?? You believe the word ""defenestration"" is one that the masses should know of and use on a daily basis? Let me guess you ""are"" one of those people on WoW who actually play to have the opportunity to troll online because in real life you have gotten the shit beat out of you since grade school?? Exactly how many times in your life have you been given the chance to use a word that literally means ""to throw someone out a window""??? Its a word used hundreds of years ago to describe an event that supposedly started the 30yr war by the way genius. If you were in my home right now Id use said word right before I made it a literal exclamation Reply Persagax June 3 2016 1122 pm I dont know when or where I picked it up but defenestrate has been in my vocabulary as long as I can remember. From the Latin de fenestra (out of [through] the window.) Its a wonderful word to have at your disposal. Youll never know when you need it. Reply Lmnope June 5 2016 718 pm Defenestrate is a perfectly cromulent word. If you recognize the last but not the first of the multi-syllabic words in the preceding sentence that is an indictment of the reader not the author. Reply Leon July 19 2016 859 am Youre a loser. Reply Hawk June 6 2016 833 am David Ehrlich - stfu and just go cook smthg. Probably you are more talented in cooking than writing. Reply Gabriel June 11 2016 1259 am I am stunned at your lack of knowledge of the source material. Green orcs are slaves to the old gods from drinking Mannoroths blood. Which makes them slaves to the old gods. There is literal shit tons of lore that cannot be covered in 2 hours. Please go back to your LOTOR sad sack linear bullshit. Reply Daniel Young June 19 2016 1210 pm There seemed to be a lack of interest from the reviewer as if it was the intention to aim his sights at the movie regaurdless of how good or bad it was. From the time and time again when they explain what is happening and why its happening to the difference in orcs and their intentions. I am not sure why one would go into a movie and pay no attention then blatantly insult it with weak at best arguments is beyond me. Where points like ""Garona was half human"" and constantly riffing off of that line when clearly she war around before humans were established. She was quite clearly half Draenei. (the only other type of character established by that point in the movie. I could go on but much like you I didnt put in my full attention to finish this review. I think by my commenting you have probably already won but I have nothing better to do with my time so I guess we both lose. Reply Daniel Young June 19 2016 1212 pm My mistake I have replied instead of commenting. While im here The orcs were not green because they were slaves for drinking manaroths blood they were green because of the warlock enhancements they recieved. Or as the movie called it ""Fell"" Orcs turned red after drinking mannaroths blood and became bloodthirsty slaves of Kiljaiden. Not an old god but an alien. Reply Tom June 11 2016 429 am Im a big warcraft and WOW fan yes I use those terms seperatly because they are different. I do agree that while some things were not quiet in line with the lore no movie based on a book or video game is ever going to be 100% cannon and im ok with that. I found the movie very entertaining and I found its attempts at at remaining canon very acceptable. I do have to agree that those who are not familiar with the WARCRAFT lore in general will probably feel lost (My brother was at first) and that is probably the only real flaw i saw with the movie. If i had to rate it (as a warcraft lore junkie) I would honesltly give it 4 stars simple based on the fact that the movie sadly isnt very welcoming to people who arnt familiar with the story line or its characters. I will say two things I was pleased with how they handeled Karazan and how they nailed Khadgars lack of grace. Also someone posted below about Lothar becoming king and stated that Terenas was king instead. Lothar never became king of stormwind this is true but Terenas Menethil was king of LORDAERON not stormwind (Sorry lore nerd moment) Reply Brian Williamson June 20 2016 927 pm Very well made. Captivating from start to finish and gives the audience what they ""should"" be there for. ""Entertainment"" I admit that if you never had the pleasure to actually play WoW you may find it hard to understand the storyline at first. But please remember one thing ""everyone"" has their opinions on what makes a film good or bad. Just because a ""paid"" critic decides to take the low road and decimate it shouldnt influence how others view it. His opinion is just that ""his"". He isnt a director he isnt a writer and most likely he isnt even a gamer. So truthfully the opinion of lets say a 17 yr old kid actually holds more weight on a film like this compared to some silly person who believes he is qualified to determine what the masses will or wont enjoy. I am a 48 yr old male with a 14 yr old son and we ""both"" LOVED it I have a double Masters in accounting and business admin and I played WoW for about 4 yrs. Unfortunately a divorce and other similar enjoyable surprises of life had to take precedent and I had to stop playing. In closing I would just like to say this. We may not know art/film BUT we know what we like Yup..... Reply George June 2 2016 403 pm WOrst review i have read for a while.watched the movie in I-MAX throughly enjoyed it.Nowhere near as bad as he says Reply Dave June 3 2016 1113 pm This movie is definitely as bad as he says. It was absolute rubbish. Reply Pat June 14 2016 1003 pm You are a tragedy. And to all of those who say this rubbish you are rubbish. Dont act like you have made better movies before.

Reply Joanne Marcus June 12 2016 1110 pm Dancinglady Reply Joanne Marcus June 12 2016 1112 pm I am not familiar with the Warcraft world but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie as a fantasy fan. I was able to follow the plot characters and locations. I do not understand why so many critics are panning this movie. I would go see a sequel also. Reply Floyd June 2 2016 425 pm Terrible review. Watched the film. Its no lord of the rings but it has its moments and impresses on a technical level. Reply Lukas June 2 2016 430 pm OMG this review is yet another total piece of shit. Reply WJC June 2 2016 443 pm Epic levels of smarminess shouted into the void. Round peg square hole. Reply WJC June 2 2016 447 pm Oh and someone already broke the embargo to drop the Battlefield Earth bomb. Tsk. Reply Erlend A. E. June 2 2016 519 pm Most of your words are slurs and fancy ways of saying ""I hated this"". First of all no not based on WoW. Its based on Warcraft hence named Warcraft. Surely you cant expect them to make the movie as appealing to newcomers as to Blizzard fans? This movie was made for those already connected to the franchise from what I gather. And as a big fan of the warcraft lore I was blown away by the rendition of some of the bigger characters. Khadgar is as clumsy as the lore says he is(if you read between the lines and from the bigger picture of the lore) Medivh was great Lothar was believable and so on. The landscapes were very well done - they were true to warcraft not World of Warcraft. When stuff only happens in Dalaran Karazhan Stormwind and the black morass(apart from the pre-broken eastern ridge of Hellfire) you only play scenes in these landscapes/locations. Although a lot more things happen in the lore this lays down the majority of the story of how Llane died Lothar became king Thrall was born and so on. Garona is half-orc half-draenei and as in the Warcraft lore(the continued lore into WoW mind you - theyre trying to weave in their new lesser lore as well cant blame them) she initially believes shes half-human. HOWEVER they failed to highlight that shes not just a ""slave"" taken in by GulDan but also his personal ASSASSIN. Thats kind of disappointing I suppose. But hell I expected a disaster with this movie and was positively surprised. Your review seems inaccurate to me given what I have of knowledge in the lore of Warcraft and my own experience of watching this movie. Reply Epic_mouse June 6 2016 1123 am Would just like to correct you lothar was never a king after the first war the king was king Terenas Reply Rafa June 6 2016 403 pm Actually Garona is not the only big fail king Llane died when the orcs destroyed and pillage Stormwind and garona murdered him because she was a double agente clearly should have been showned how the humans lost and had to flee to Lordaeron after and could be here all day refering to lore fails that are soo manny that doesnt even looks like Blizzard supervised it... The most non sense comments or critics that i have read about this movie is comparing it to Lord of the rings or any other movie or story of the sort thats just dumb and lack of knowledge and critics should be a bit more informed before doing critics on these bases... The other is even more senseless when people come and say this movie is based in warcraft and not Wow (world of warcraft)... Warcraft is a lore that started with the game warcraft along all this years Blizzard made the story line in a way that the story line some you know by playing the game and other you know by Reading the books both complete themselves thats the amazing part for exemple the ashbringer by playing the game you know part of its story but other parts only in the books you can read about it. Saying that the movie is based on warcraft and not on Wow its almost has dumb as comparing it to the Lord of the rings Its a movie based on warcraft Lore warcraft lore includes books comics warcraft and world of warcraft Ofc the movie could have been better not in terms of effects but in terms of lore for me its the only fail and a big one some caracters could have been more intense better fight scenes...etc The ammount of time and resources they had they could have done a epic movie and not just this. About this critic the only thing I can assume is that he never played the game or read any of the books or comics and knows nothing about it to do a constructive critic and his just talking about this without even knowing what to say but bad things...Thats wrong Reply Jack June 2 2016 539 pm Just another ""professional critic"" copying and pasting what all the other critics are saying. When these reviews have the same jokes that other critics have said it gets painfully obvious.

Reply Mike Kelley June 7 2016 1258 pm "" Well it looks like someone got a thesaurus as a graduation gift from their Liberal Arts program."" This is the perfect comment. This review criticizes the Warcraft movie for taking itself too seriously and dousing itself in a faux-epic fur coat. Thats what makes the language in this review so ironic. Reply 7urmoil June 2 2016 604 pm Haha another desperate selfproclaimed critic whos desperate to make cash for the weekly rent. Youre pathetic.

Your review is meaning-less next time please place ur comments on mistakes done not the story line of a game developped to a movie made by Blizzard and published by Blizzard.

Reply SKA June 2 2016 659 pm I also saw the film in IMAX 3D last night and I have to agree with the gist if not the tone of the review. I think because I had much lower expectations than a WoW fan would or because of the trailers or because BvS Cap 3 X-Men 6(?) Id give it a solid D. Erhlich is using some strong harsh but surely entertaining metaphors - maybe some unfair comparisons but hey the ""syngeristic"" path of this property is very aware of comparisons - but hes right on point. Its an incredibly disappointing item even in the text of the film when it starts off with promise and the irony of the orcs having more dramatic weight than the non-orcs. It just all feels arbitrary and without purpose except to have the fans giggle and the rest of us cringe and roll our eyes. Reply Vasily June 2 2016 717 pm Oh come on. Yes Im a Warcraft fan and this might just illustrate your point but... It was bad but not ""F-grade"" bad. Like I saw worse fantasy epics with acting and plot-holes just as dreadful but much more self-serious which is what just made them insufferable as compared to this one. Id say that its maybe a C- or D+ material but not a ""tragedy"". Rather a pity that all the talent involved are ultimately wasted. Reply Grom Hellscream June 2 2016 726 pm Mate that review was fucking shit Reply Steve June 3 2016 104 pm I really like gaming but all these smug anti-intellectual gamers whove crawled out of their usual darkened gaming forums are really tiresome. We get it guys you dont like film criticism (or critical thought in general it seems) but here on what youd call the rest of the internet we tend to appreciate it. People also have a vocabulary that stretches beyond two syllables but then you lot wouldnt know about that having never ventured here before. As for the review itself; while bringing up some fair points I think putting this film on the level of Battlefield Earth is kind of hyperbole.

Like seriously bro how do you wanna be taken serious with those kind of ideas. Hitler was a Tyrant that made awfull things that people accepted because he was able to brainwash people with the power of his speech playing with peoples fears. Just like Guldan Reply Julian van wierst June 2 2016 752 pm What the actual fuck did I just read? Nothing makes sense in this review as it was written by someone who decided to put an end to himself. First of all the movie was absolutely stunning to watch even for the second time I cried of epicnes at the same time in. Everyone I brought with me into the movie were in love ""Best movie I have ever seen"" they said. I am requesting for this to be taken down. David you have NO SINGLE IDEA of what even is going on. first Garona half human what? She is half draenei DO SOME RESEARCH BEFORE YOU WRITE SOMETHING Reply Hallowed Fields June 2 2016 758 pm Its these bad reviews that dont allow actual good movies to get the attention they deserve. While you and your kin want to claim its a horrid abomination there are numerous people from around the world (fans and non fans) that have already seen the movie who claim it to have its trouble but overall a good movie. Critics have forgotten what its like to actually enjoy a movie through the eyes of the average moviegoer and instead look at as a homework assignment. Yes I do play WoW but not butthurt over the reviews. Like most peopleI have watched some really good movies that critics for some unknown reason trashed. I think the movie world would be much better off without critics telling us whats good and whats bad. If it looks good just go see it and give it a chance. If it doesnt appeal then thats ok too. Reply Bruce Darren Acosta June 2 2016 801 pm Warcraft is the Battlefield of the 21st century what a load of bull you critics just like doing the way you want it to be you havent seen the movie why dont you go and watch it if any WoW fans and non fans want to watch it they can watch the movie. Reply PeterL June 2 2016 832 pm ive seen it and what strikes me with your review is a total lack of knowledge and how wrong you got the story. If you really call this battlefield earth is only based on a hipster idea that movies should not be based on a game and that you see this as a cash crab whitch its not They had a story to tell and they did is it a perfect movie no not even close but they did set up the world really well and now can they go more into the better storys as the rise of the lich king etc...

I think there is a money trail to follow or lack there of. Reply Jarret June 2 2016 837 pm Frist off this movie is not an adaptation of World of Warcraft. This movie is an adaptation of blizzards game Warcraft Orcs amp; Humans that was first released in 1994 .This movie predates World of Warcraft by 30years in there lore.

I want this movie to be a success because if people havent noticed all the epic fantasy trilogies are long but gone. I would also like to see a review that doesnt take into account the fact that it comes from a video game but I guess that is just the trend... 30 years from now there will be a generation that fully accepts video game. I long to live in that time. Reply Hunter8472 June 2 2016 904 pm This guy... Sounds like he hated the game WAAAY b4 the movie came out to recap the story lol. This guy dont realize this movie was made 4 the fans (including me). N the game has been making over  billion per year so Blizzard wants the movie 2 be epic yes but its being made mostly 4 the fans that number almost 20million so where do u get a small following from lol... Just go n enjoy it n dont try to understand it. It will confuse the non-followers ;) Reply Nick June 2 2016 905 pm Garona is not half human actually. How would it be possible that an orc and human had a kid if these races never met. They never said anything about being human. (She is actually half draenei the race that gets harvested in the begin of the movie). So your joke isnt just bad but also incorrect. And just shitting on a movie isnt a review.

Reply Alex June 2 2016 933 pm I didnt expect much from a WoW movie but come on. Have you actually seen Battlefield Earth? Reply Phil June 2 2016 940 pm It was never stated in the movie that Garona was part human only that she ""looked more like"" them than other orcs. Anyway I dont know much about the WarCraft lore but that point didnt bother me at all when I watched the movie because I assumed she was just that ""an orc that looked more human"". And actually I discovered afterwards on some WarCraft wiki that shes half-orc half-draenor (another race coming from the orcs world that didnt any spotlight in the movie) so I dont see where ""even the Warcraft community"" would be ""confused about her lineage"". Everything else I see in this review is either strawmen fallacies like Garonas one or either cleverly written but gratuitous mockery to what are actually perfectly acceptable parts of the movie (like the couple play scene). But even more outrageous about this review is the fact that most of the interesting points of the movie (also the majority of its plot) have been completely eclipsed in a poor attempt to scoff at it almost as if the reviewer didnt really see the movie just like other comments said. Or maybe he was running out of bad metaphors to compare against such excellent material? Reply radastrophy June 15 2016 901 pm You did not watch the same movie I did. Most of it is nothing of what happened in Warcraft whether it is the lore or the film itself. You do use clever words to try and compensate for the lack of comprehension for the movies story. Youve done a good job at making a whole nation of players angry but for the record to all the commenters it was not made for the fans but for everyone. I did not play the games nor it was my favorite genre of game to play but the story was compelling enough to get myself an account to World of Warcraft and play so I guess it is mission accomplished on my end not that it matters much. Reply radastrophy June 15 2016 902 pm My apologies the comment was supposed to not be for you personally. Reply Mario June 3 2016 120 am Come on. Its totally clear this guy accomplished his goal. To make a ton of money for this website by click baiting everyone who wants to see the movie into finding out just why he gave it a lower rating then every other movie hes ever reviewed or seen or that has even been made since he decided on a rating of 0/100. What a complete troll. Guess critics throw objectivity impartiality and fairness out the window when they see that opportunity to make a ton of money on ads off a fan base that might be a little attached to both their games and their computer.

The film is garbage its stocked with the only desperate people who would touch it but the acting wont improve their situation.

Reply Lore June 3 2016 639 am This is getting ridiculous. I didnt know the story of WARCRAFT (games and whatnot) and I liked the film. I assumed Garona was a half blue thing due to being able to communicate with the first prisoners(blue ones). The characters were great especially the orcs. The humans grew on me and I liked them too. My only complaint is that this movie needed to be longer about 30-40 minutes longer. I saw Battlefield earth and no way is this on the same level as that. Do we really need movies to spoonfeed us the story? I feel like thats an insult to our intelligence. I followed it just fine and the lore even intrigued me to buy the book. Reply Kev June 3 2016 658 am I have seen it twice in the opening week the second time with my wife who has never played any of the Warcraft games but she really enjoyed it as a movie.

Reply Throughtheportal June 4 2016 226 pm Dear Mr. Erhlich Having just seen Warcraft in the cinema I must say I am astonished by your review of Warcraft. Having read most reviews that have come out yours is one of the most negative. I myself work in the entertainment industry and this makes me a critical man of movies and series. I have done so for about 16 years. I am not a fanboy. I do understand some of your points but giving this movie an F (a 0 on Metacritic) is beyond professionalism and I almost believe that this review is mainly so negative (putting it mildy) to get attention to Indiewire (clickbait). In which you succeeded. I am sure you are an ethical journalist so I hope I am wrong about the above. Maybe the people going to the movie are right (http//www.imdb.com/title/tt0803096/reviews?ref_=tt_ov_rt) maybe you are but giving a movie a 0 is not right. It really is not because people read these things and base their cinematic choices on this. Meaning that your review might sway people to go to other movies. In this case I find that a pity because me and also my wife loved the movie. I hope that maybe you will change your rating to reflect better that production value of the movie. No movie should ever get a F or a 0. Reply Odin June 4 2016 235 pm Very poor and empty review.

I would love this movie to succeed. Reply Mike June 4 2016 421 pm This review is all about the reviewer and has nothing whatsoever to do with the film which was a hell of a lot of fun. I think this film might represent the widest gulf between professional critics and general theater-goers in the history of the medium because all the critics seem to be suddenly ingesting some bad catnip where all the member reviews on IMDB and online at large are absolutely gushing. Trust your gut instinct. If you want to immerse yourself in a gorgeous fantasy world see some truly inspired battle scenes and see the beginnings of a new film franchise that I hope will survive the absurd driveling of critics who undervalue something that was crafted with so much care then go for it. While the David Ehrlichs of the world whine and mewl and espouse their tepid ""opinions"" you go and enjoy the hell out of the ride of Warcraft. Reply whoduni June 4 2016 515 pm I havent seen the movie but the review is a bit harsh. I can appreciate subjectivity. But an F? Really? Doubtful its that bad. Reply John June 4 2016 641 pm I think people will remember you as the guy who gave the movie %0 on metacritic. While the movie may not be a great adaptation you wouldnt be able to stand for 2 hours if it was a real %0 movie. I used to follow IndieWire but I you managed to shatter my trust with this lack of research and very unprofessionally hate-filled subjective review. Reply David J Kim June 4 2016 648 pm Well this review is the result of online ""journalism"" where websites hire kids straight out of college for cheap and refuse to hire an actual critic. Heres a newsflash to this so-called ""critic"" in 2008 the beloved Roger Ebert stated that the world of Movie Critique is soon going to die and its because rather than producing engaging and intellectual discussions about movies several critics are simply resorting to absolutism. You are contributing to a problem with reviews like these. You should go see how Mark Ellis and Kristian Harloff do movie reviews and see how they channel their inner-Siskel and Ebert. Reply Kevin Fontan June 4 2016 700 pm Dear David Ehrlich You lost me right after you misused the word defenestrated. You proceed to gang rape the english language through out the rest of your review. This leads me to believe that you are in fact perhaps an Orc trying to hurt this film. Maybe you just have a broken penis and need to use words that you do not understand. Regardless please so stop doing that. Otherwise your comparison to failed Scientology films was spot on. You make us both lay in the shower and cry now so thanks for that. Reply Rock June 4 2016 734 pm Reads like Hillarity Clintons next victory speech... Author should go back to flipping burgers. Reply NameIsIrrelevant June 4 2016 738 pm This review is totally unreliable and flat out false. Fair enough some of the remarks he makes are alright; however I think when he says things such as ""The orcs are supposedly a smart species"" it is apparent that he did not follow the plot of the film whatsoever. The Orcs are not from Azeroth (the planet in which they are invading) and therefore cannot be expected to see that Guldan is ""pure evil"" as they have nothing to compare what is evil and what isnt on Azeroth. Also; at one point in the movie Durotan (an Orc) says something along the lines of ""The Orcs answer to everything is war"" (sorry if thats a bit off I cant really remember but the line is in the scene where Medivh blocks the Orcs from advancing). The quote emphasizes that the Orcs are inclined to follow Guldan as he is the leader of their assault on Azeroth. Also; the remark about them not being able to invent shirts is purely irrelevant. Many Orcs in the Warcraft universe do not wear shirts to display their size and dominance. That was plain stupid. I honestly think that Ehrlich either has no idea about anything in the Warcraft Universe or he doesnt understand the movie properly. The points I made are only but a few that he was inconsiderate about if you want some more then feel free to reply. Also; Im not saying that ALL his points are wrong the movie was by no means perfect but its not as bad as it was made out to be. Also; the movie isnt based around World of Warcraft; more so the books and the previous RTS games prior to the release of WoW. Reply james June 4 2016 739 pm This guy is a moron I dont know what he is talking about I loved this film it was good really enjoyed it so did my family who have never heard of it before. seriously get better critics... This one is clueless Reply Soma June 4 2016 803 pm This critic... Lol... You know there were at least 3 Warcraft games before WoW right? Thos movie isnt just adapted from WoW but rather the Warcraft universe... But yeah generalize by using WoW as the sole example Reply guardiaola June 4 2016 1022 pm Whats the meaning of ""By my beard"" Reply Rick June 5 2016 959 am My favorite part of this review is the comments from all the WoW dorks. Unable to read at a basic eighth grade level making non-sequiturs about ""Liberal Arts education"" their cheeto-dusted indignation palpable. The fiasco of this movie was totally worth it having gifted the world with these comments. Reply Slence June 6 2016 247 am Rick put a ring on that chode of yours and calm down. Im pretty sure you are just trying to be as insulting to the majority of people as possible by using lame stereotypes. I mean how else could someone assume that everyone has ""Cheeto dusted imagination"" What the hell does that even mean? Please explain. Reply John June 9 2016 725 pm Whod have thought Mr. Ehrlich isnt the only condescending twat around here. Do you believe that your brain grows when you feel superior towards others thanks to your illusionary complex twisted self-conception? If you guys are to smug to comprehend this movie or have no clue about its background story why do you even have to steam off your irrelevant opinions? Reply Luke June 5 2016 1041 am Holy crap this guy..... Spouting SO much nonsense its funny. I Loved it. I hope people go see it for themselves and not take this geezers opinion into account and they form their own. Reply Chucky June 5 2016 1120 am The main purpose of the movie industry has become high profits at low risk. ""Warcraft"" is a brand name intended to bring in lots of money with little effort -- just like Captain America X-Men Ninja Turtles etc. etc. Reply Reviewer of movie critics June 5 2016 1122 am I went to see this movie with a friend and his girlfriend last night. Me and my friend played the RTS Warcraft series and world of Warcraft (so Warcraft fans I suppose) while his girlfriend just tagged along because she wanted to go see a movie that night (she never heard of Warcraft before but hoped for the best). All 3 of us enjoyed the movie. Not too hard to imagine for 2 Warcraft fans/players but our 1 non gamer also enjoying it was far from certain (the most objective one of us). When I asked if the amount of locations characters and the back and forth switching between them was confusing she said It really isnt that hard to follow.. The CGI was fine characters were decent visuals were nice story was good (all 3 of us agreed on that with some minor flaws). Reading around on different websites it shows that most viewers enjoy this movie but people who are paid to review movies arent. If movie reviewers differ so much in opinion with movie watchers the reviewers are biased ( money goes a long way) or maybe reviewers have lost touch what average people expect from a movie. Reading this review I am leaning towards the first option. Why? Reread this critics review and now disregard the over-the-top comparisons the derision and the verbal diarrhea our reviewer is overly fond of. What is left precious little content of why he deems this movie is bad. I can summarize it like this the reviewer finds this story goes too fast and he had trouble following (Oh and he doesnt like Garona he finds her costuming cheap). The rest of it is just snippy comments or unexplained reasoning (Charachter motivations and identities smudge into nothingness our reviewer writes. Surely he could have explained why he thinks this instead of his first 4 paragraphs which contribute barely anything to his review). Ehrlich on the VERY VERY small chance you are reading this having an opinion (good or bad) about a movie is fine but barely or poorly explaining that opinion isnt. Reply The author of this review is autistic I think hes called David Ehrlich June 5 2016 130 pm Youre a fucking idiot I hope you know. If the movies SO bad then why not let them know through a respectable manner that it is a failure without an analogy every sentence. Not to mention you act as if youre defending the fans of the game that the movie is based off of. Their goal could be to reel in more players to the game by the movie and expand upon the movie in a sequel but this isnt Lord of the Rings and it wont be. Insert an analogy here to keep David Ehrlich interested I believe youre focusing on points that you couldnt catch because your ability to comprehend content is too little so you missed 75% of the movie. I havent seen the movie yet but even if its bad even if the numerous things of blabbed on about are true insert analogy that describes that how David Ehrlich reviewed this was preposterous. Enjoy your breakfast. Reply Reviewer of movie critics June 5 2016 155 pm Cant believe you delete comments you dont like despite the fact I had no name calling in it and had well explained reasons behind everything. What a bunch of censorship Reply anonymouslul June 5 2016 230 pm That was terrible movie rip money ( Reply iazriel June 5 2016 443 pm lol the reviewer is so fucking ignorant of the Warcraft lore... Makes me wonder why did he even bother to go and see a movie heavily based on a game and novels he never heard of or read. Totally unsuitable for this. Reply Jad June 6 2016 533 pm Its a great movie better then most Ive seen this year. All the plot wholes the critic describes have perfectly good explanations kinda sad the man didnt even do his homework before picking up the pen to write a review. Its funny he think himself smart w/o bothering to take the plot line as it is and enjoy its evolution. All is goint to be revealed eventually thats the beauty and mystery of Warcraft. Sadly some people just want the fully story plot served on a silver platter. This was the begining of an legendary war depicted beautifully. Reply Anonymous Anonymous June 7 2016 1121 am Your review is so biased that it made me vomit. Before reviewing a movie maybe try to inform yourself about it. The movie is taken from Warcraft the RTS game; not World of Warcraft. Garona is not half-orc and half-human but half-orc and half-draenei. You just talk about the plot (of which you know nothing evidently) but what about the great use of CGI etc.? Poor review Reply Anthony June 7 2016 258 pm lol Mr. Ehrlich you are just pure idiot and braindead person. I saw some of your reviews on metacancer.com and Id like to ask if you really think that you have any qualifications for reviews? In every way you should be fired because unfortunately you really dont have qualifications for reviews.... I thought that I would at least see some your positives on masterpieces like Shawshank Redemption Schindlers List Godfather Forrest Gump or Green Mile but hey you didnt even make a reviews for the greatest films and you call yourself movie critic? Well maybe its better I didnt found any of them because when I see how you act like critic... People like you are the scum of the society you talk about something when you actually know shit about it - its not based on World of Warcraft... Reply Casey June 7 2016 347 pm Id suggest the revewier look up the definition of the word ""homunculus."". Orcs are most certainly not homunculi at all in fact they are really the opposite of the term. I am curious however as to what the reviewer thought the word meant when he misused it.

Reply doug June 10 2016 1235 pm Holy hell all these ass-pained warfat fans getting mad that their precious blizzard movie wasnt that great and someone called them out on it. Jesus christ the movie sucked but these salty tears were so worth it. Reply Rob June 11 2016 508 am There is clearly a negative bias with this guy. The movie wasnt amazing but it wasnt awful either. I would say it is worth seeing if fantasy is your thing. Reply Sam June 12 2016 603 am Warcraft was fantastically enjoyable masterfully executed (at the very least in terms of world-building and fantastical characters and story) and all of its features are elevated for the fans of the games. I played Warcraft 3 and World of Warcraft for about a year during which I had a great amount of fun playing with friends and learning about the world of Azeroth This makes me biased of course but nonetheless. Warcraft first amazes the viewer by showing them beautiful shots and animation in the form of the Orcs on their home world of Draenor. I have to say the moment I saw them I didnt stop smiling until I left the theatre. They looked amazing The characters of Durotan GulDan and even Orgrim Doomhammer had depth to their personalities facial expressions and movements. Duncan Jones did us right on that front. When it comes to gripes that people have it often comes down to Garona and Anduin Lothar. While yes I do think it was an odd choice to have Garona look the way she did she fits just fine into the world. Yes I do think the romance may have been a bit rushed but in reality the movie spans the course of at least months (packed into 2 hours and keeps up a fast engaging pace the whole time) and come on you can see Lothars attraction right off the bat. The film was by no means perfect but it was fun the entire time. I couldnt stop smiling when I saw the orcs and my smile widened farther when I got to see magic on screen like never before. It was fantasy taken to the fantastical and if you ever expected anything less going into a movie about another world where humans are fighting orcs after going through a portal powered by dark magic then you need to rethink a whole lot of things.

Reply Sylvia Lars July 27 2016 1054 am ""Garonas inexplicable parentage"" You sure you actually SAW the movie? They explained it really clear. ""Orcs for those unfamiliar with the videogame franchise "" What? Why are you explaining it like those who dont know a thing about the franchise wont get it just by watching the movie? ""these motion-captured monstrosities have braided hair giant hammers and protruding molars (which they pierce with rings). The ones who have lines are white and the ones who exist as fodder for the action scenes are green -- while this dichotomy almost certainly causes some kind of racial discord in the orc community"" Coff Coff Guldan Also why are you so surprised by orcs appeareance? I know I know this is your FIRST approach to a fantasy movie EVER. ""The orcs are supposedly a smart species but they have yet to invent t-shirts"" Again you should go research at least a little about fantsasy genre. ""nor can they seem to figure out why every world they inhabit seems to start dying after their obviously evil wizard leader (Daniel Wu as the power-mad Guldan) drains the land for fuel."" sighs Durotan realized that already but he wasnt strong enough now had the numbers to confront Guldan. Do I have to repeat every line in the movie for you? "" inciting a needlessly convoluted war between orcs and humans."" Sorry but their warld was dying and the only way of living for the orcs is war... oh wait but these things were already said in the movie why do I have to repeat everything? ""empty and uninspired Lothar""? wth? Did you expect him to make philosophical remarks every 3 seconds? Lothar is a fighter a very good one if not the best in this world he is friends AND brother-in-law with the KING he doesnt need to prove hes smart or clever time and time again hes no green boy they all know his value. The famous commander of the great Azeroths army. ""When a dorky young mage named Khadgar"" Oh sure because All mages and wizards that are no kids should knowww a thing or two about the world and they should be respected everywhere they go. Right. Well welcome to human race where we all are different. You can have also have young people scholars too ""fangs on the wrong half of her teeth"" Sorry but you should see this movie Warcraft. There are people named ""orcs"" whose fangs are that way too. Maybe then the way of Garonas teeth wont be rare to you. ""the films plot would be almost completely unchanged if she were erased from it entirely"" Yeah because interpreters are everywhere in this world. And look King Llanes still being betrayed And Guldan lets Lothar goes anyway I have no more time but Ill give you an advice go see more fantasy movies no matter how old they are and read more fantasy books where you are at it and THEN start thinking about calling yourself a ""professional critic"".

So a certain level of respect is due to Moon director Duncan Jones for attempting to inject new life - and a hint of relevance - into this tired so-last-decade concern. Sadly his best intentions arent enough like its ten-foot anti-heroes the orcs Warcraft is noisy lumbering and not terribly bright. Much of the problem lies with the cast - Travis Fimmel is a walking charisma void as strapping warrior Anduin a sort of Aragorn without the personal charm (Aragormless?). Hes the land of Azeroths best hope against those murderous dimension-hopping orcs and hes backed by a plucky band of equally forgettable white dudes with bad hair Dominic Cooper as well-meaning dullard King Llayne Ben Schnetzer from Pride as trainee wizard Khadgar and Ben Foster totally misused as the magical Guardian. Their snaggle-toothed orc foes have a touch more personality despite being buried under layers of CGI Toby Kebbell gives real warmth to Durotan the chieftain for whom randomly massacring humans doesnt always guarantee a good time. He also embodies Joness most interesting and tricky conceit - that newcomers to your land might not all be there to wreck the place (though the film implies most of them probably are). The total absence of originality here is notable but it neednt have been a problem with a tighter plot a touch of humour and some peppier less slab-fisted action scenes this might actually have worked - a kind of Guardians of the Galaxy meets Lord of the Rings. But Warcraft is content just to trundle along at its own ponderous pace chucking in dwarves spells love scenes giant eagles clay monsters silly names and battle scenes seemingly at random. Fantastical perhaps but far from fantastic.

The movie stayed close to the lore and only deviated slightly to be ""edible"" by the mainstream non Warcraft fans. One example is Garona her original story was perhaps a bit too complex to implement properly the extended cut will however show more of her origin and clear up a few things.A trilogy of the first war alone could easily have been made. Many of the complaints come from those who feel certain things were introduced too fast too erratic and without proper explanations. Just remember how much LotR made out of introduction to the different settlements and locations Warcraft spits Stormwind Ironforge Karazhan in your face before you can say ""what?"" also my friend immediately asked while we were watching the movie - Whats Kirin Tor?Its an excellent movie with some flaws but it stays true to a universe I love the World of Warcraft. My friend was puzzled at times but he did enjoy it a lot.

It felt more like bashing just ""because"". This person has done no research what so ever about the warcraft universe has no idea how far back it goes ( 20 years ) and thinks he has it all figured out just by knowing it is based on a game called Warcraft....So here a review from someone who DOES know about the Warcraft universe. The movie starts out when the orcs are preparing to leave Draenor. Now i have to admit the moment the movie starts i felt like they started the movie half way into the beginning of the lore. There is no story telling on who Guldan is and where he found his Fel power. The viewers just get dropped in right in the middle of it right before the Dark Portal gets openend by Guldan with no explanation of how we got to this point. I never found that to be explained in the entire movie and to me it felt more like they had to make a choice on where to start otherwise the movie would be to long.Now i have found several points in the movie where i had that same feeling that something about the origin of the characters was missing an important detail here and there that would have made more sense for the viewers to understand the characters better. A big one would be about Medivh how did he get corrupted and who was the woman inside the cube. Now i know how Medivh got corrupted by the Fel and who was in the cube but for the ""normal"" viewer it must have been very confusing. They should have added more story telling here and it could have been done easily and in 2 lines even. For example the woman starts speaking to Khadgar spouting all her mystic lines about the darkness is the light and in the light is darkness etc etc etc. Instead she could have said while being pregnant of Medivh she fought against Sargeras and the fel basicly ""infected"" Medivh while in the whomb. To me that is a rather important little detail they should have told the people...... Now even though the story telling had its little flaws it was made up for with stunning CGI humor and little easter eggs hidden away for the fans out there. A murloc happily camping by the road ready to summon his entire family if you get to close  and attack you  I have to be honest and i will be. I am a fangirl and i have been for atleast a decade and i was scared of going to see this movie. Scared that the memories i have of Warcraft and the World of Warcraft would be tainted by a badly made movie. I was scared for nothing in the end. From the moment the movie started i felt like i was finally walking into that world myself. I was sitting there watching these amazing landscapes and it felt like i was walking there myself.  Seeing the orcs for the first time had a chill go done my spine. The CGI was done so well that i could imagine the power that was flowing through their muscles. The raw power these creatures use in their battles. And the actors made me believe it was REAL  Isnt that what a movie should be about ? Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMore13 days agoJacob EFeaturedI get critical reviews but really? Tom did you ever hear of the word ""Warcraft"" before seeing this movie? I doubt it. Or did you play the game and maybe it was too hard for you so now you have an agenda against everything Warcraft? Maybe youre upset that they didnt fit dozens of novels and several video games (with several expansions on each except for the first one) into one movie. If thats the case I feel your pain. I watched 20 minutes of the first ""Lord of the Rings"" movie and am pissed because I didnt get the whole story. Maybe I should write a review on how horrible it is and I can be just like you writing random things that I am clueless about.I suppose maybe the 25-year Warcraft franchise has been a complete failure as you put it. That Blizzard company must be bankrupt (worth about 30bn USD). At least put some real thought into what you write instead of this mindless babbling about something you have absolutely no knowledge of. I mean your writing is okay but you really dont know what youre talking about at all.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMay 31 2016Ryan DFeaturedAmazing Film.

"Warcraft Review World of Warcraft Movie an Epic Fail | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Warcraft Geoff Berkshire Associate Editor Features geoffberkshire 585 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr Courtesy of Universal May 24 2016 | 0300PM PT Hollywoods habit of turning hit videogames into unwatchable movies continues unabated. The epic battle at the center of ""Warcraft"" isnt the clash between humans and orcs. Thats just what takes up roughly two hours of screen time. The true conflict comes from filmmakers trying to tell a story with soul and struggling against the inherent ridiculousness of the commodity theyre working with. It shouldnt take a mage to foresee that this pricey and preposterous adaptation of an online gaming phenomenon was preordained for artistic mediocrity. With little concern for all those already perplexed at the mention of orcs and mages ""Warcraft"" plunges headfirst into a fantasy realm teeming with mythical creatures magical spells and exotically named characters and locations. Its a take-it-or-leave-it approach likely to have most audience members opting for the latter though devotees of the immersive role-playing source material may have an entirely different experience. If so Universal will have to hope they storm the box office early and often. Otherwise the studio could be looking at one of the biggest duds of the summer. Thats despite the noble effort of director Duncan Jones who helmed the lower-budget sci-fi wonders ""Moon"" and ""Source Code"" and labors mightily here to craft a solid emotional foundation in his script with Charles Leavitt. The ""Warcraft"" games -- which have radically declined in popularity from a high of 12 million regular users in 2010 to a recent low of close to 5 million (so low the company behind it no longer releases subscriber counts to the public) -- were never meant to have the narrative depth of ""The Lord of the Rings"" or even ""Game of Thrones."" But the film cribs freely from both of those sources anyway as well as ""Star Wars"" ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" ""Avatar"" and numerous other recent blockbusters. The orcs a race of giant warrior beasts flee their dying homeland of Draenor through a portal to the peaceful realm of Azeroth where they wage a full-scale attack on unsuspecting humans for control of the land. Orc soldier Durotan (Toby Kebbell like all orc players working in performance capture) questions the brutal ways of his clansmen -- led by warchief Blackhand (Clancy Brown) and power-hungry warlock Guldan (Daniel Wu) -- and believes a compromise without bloodshed is possible. His counterpart on the human side is Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel of TVs ""Vikings"") a knight devoted to serving his benevolent king and queen (Dominic Cooper and Ruth Negga). Durotans fierce mate Draka (Anna Galvin) delivers an adorable orc baby early on and Lothars son Callan (Burkely Duffield) is determined to impress his father on the battlefield. Those family ties are duly exploited for maximum melodramatic impact as the dual protagonists rage and question and mourn and soulfully ponder the complexity that exists on two sides of any conflict. Ditto Garona (Paula Patton) a slave claiming to be half-orc half-human who makes her way through the portal and finds herself torn between the two sides. She quickly gets cozy with Lothar but its hard to take Patton or the character seriously with her ""Star Trek""-alien-esque green skin and the oversized fangs jutting out from her jaw looking like a last minute find in the Halloween store bargain bin and making her sound like she has a mouth full of magic beans. And that goes to the root of the problems with ""Warcraft"" its an unwaveringly earnest film that never owns up to exactly how campy every character every conflict and every new realm truly is. Ben Foster has another central role as reclusive wizard Medivh a ""Guardian"" of Azeroth who has been not so subtly dabbling in dark magic. Hes introduced sculpting a golem (surely youll recall the old chestnut about Chekhovs golem) shirtless and wild-eyed but it takes Lothar quite some time to piece together the warning signs. Medivh should be fun but Fosters deadpan turn is like the movie around him a drag. With its meticulously detailed realms built out primarily on soundstages and enhanced via CGI during extensive post-production ""Warcraft"" aims for fresh and eye-popping and yet ends up shopworn and rather tacky. It fits into a long line of visually audacious Hollywood gambles In success you wind up with a sleeper that few see coming like ""300"" (or if you strike the bulls-eye a phenomenon like ""Avatar"") but the ones that miss -- ""The Spirit"" ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" ""Sucker Punch"" -- tend to tank hard. Boasting more than 2000 visual effects shots its dispiriting to think about the time energy planning and precision that went into ""Warcraft"" when the final product brings to mind those animated advertisements for iPhone app games. So good at making the most outlandish elements of his first two films seem completely credible Jones cant find a way to get this cartoony spectacle to soar. His heartfelt approach to the material only underlines the silliness. Production designer Gavin Bocquet costume designer Mayes C. Rubeo and visual effects supervisors Bill Westenhofer Jeff White and Jason Smith lead the heavy lifting on the artisans side since what the producers essentially purchased with the source material is a collection of locations wardrobe weapons and spells. ""Warcraft"" ends with a set-up for a sequel but also the feeling that if this is what combat looks like its time to give peace a chance.

Steve says July 25 2016 at 656 pm This critic is clueless... Amazing film. Reply Rob Swain says July 18 2016 at 652 pm Fantastic movie stunning beautiful powerful nothing to compare it to. These whining critics who contribute nothing to society and live only to tear down other peoples work are on the same level as the mold on my bred in the ref grey movie Reply gimerto says July 16 2016 at 357 pm you are out of control? Last night I watch this movie with my family its all amazing acting effects etc. and we enjoy it a lot please Geoff Berkshire keep your bad review for yourself. Reply Timur says July 13 2016 at 630 am Looks like you pretty much hate every fantasy - adventure movies your review was.. bad. and wrong. and i like how most of the people liked it and the rest said it was meh to be honest im the one of those who said it was meh not because of its ""Oh look there is orcs that is green and that is not looking real at all 1/10."" but because it was short and it was lacking humour and well while its history was big (warcrafts.) they tried to fit it in the movie that is not even 2 hours long. But oh hey that doesnt matter only that matters there is green-ish people not realistic VOTE FOR TRUMP. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN (AND ITS REALISTIC) Reply Your Mom says July 12 2016 at 757 pm Sounds like you have no interest in fantasy adventure films. Maybe you should find another column to blog about. Maybe horoscopes because mine always seem to be bleak with poor excuses for critiques. Reply Sharey says July 12 2016 at 829 am Your review stinks WarCraft is a darn good movie I love it and I dont even know about the game. Its earning big at the box office so I guess the joke is on you. Reply Warcraft says July 10 2016 at 949 pm I have been a fan of the Warcraft universe since 2006 when I started playing vanilla WoW. Since then I have gone back and played the original Warcraft games as well as read all the Warcraft/World of Warcraft novels. I love this universe and lore and I am very excited to see it on the big screen. Reply SonOfThrall says July 9 2016 at 834 am Just 1 sentnc .... Play the game. and ur review will go from saying ""mediocre"" to ""this movie was epic"" Reply Adrian Labastida says July 8 2016 at 700 pm I totally disagree with this review feels like hating too much when it isnt bad and in fact the story and lore of Warcraft is too big to fit and explain in one movie i loved the setting theres a bunch of details which only a player would catch loved the pace FX photography and the storys reach just prepping the ground for greater things to come Reply Trish says July 6 2016 at 540 am Never played Warcraft nor did I know the characters... But have to say I was totally emerged in this movie... Loved everything about it Cant wait for the sequel...47 yo mum of 3 Reply sean plantinga says July 4 2016 at 1115 pm Yeah Dummy its not World of Warcraft the movie. its Warcraft the movie as in the first Warcraft game and it follows the story quite well. Maybe do a little research before you blindly vomit out a review Reply Stacey Davis says July 4 2016 at 120 pm I havent even gotten to see the movie and already I can be sure Ill more than disagree with this guys review of it. After all whats wrong with a company that makes a great mmorpg making a great movie for its great players? Why does EVERYTHING have to appeal to the lowest common denominator (him and his self-congratulated pithy comments and attitude for one) Well Ill post this to become part of the apparently active conversation spawned by his drool and derisively droll drivel of a movie review and leave you guys to it ;) Oh and happy 4th to all my lovely US friends and family today ) Reply Damon says July 1 2016 at 744 am Terrible review Reply luandre vd berg says June 30 2016 at 451 am I Hate to say it but most of the reviews of the Warcraft movie Ive read dont do the movie any damn justice. The story of the beginning wont be kill kill all the time for petes sake. but when those fight scenes came they were epic. the movie has some minor flaws i give it that but overall. it was something everyone could enjoy. I as a Warcraft fan Loved the hippogriff going bad ass on the orcs. Reply Kieron Badenhorst says June 30 2016 at 241 am This movie was super enjoyable I loved the Orcs and the CG was top notch... And I cant wait to see the second movie PS the Hippogriff was awesome too. Reply Peter says June 28 2016 at 150 pm Ok I just saw this today. I have never played Warcraft but i am a huge lover of the fantasy genre having played most of the old-school crpgs and pen amp; paper Damp;D growing up. This movie was made for fantasy lovers and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It did feel a little rushed to me they could have made it three hours but overall I did enjoy it. I try to support just about anything made in the fantasy genre hoping more and better movies get to be made. There is a ton of material out there that I know would make great movies....The Dragonlance saga as well as an entire world in the Forgotten Realms universe. I thought after the success of Lord of the Rings that it would start a flood of movies in the genre but it has yet to happen. Ill keep hoping. Reply Jake says June 28 2016 at 946 am It is a great movie dont waste your time reading this article. Reply Clarince Stall says June 26 2016 at 1035 pm I dont play WoW at all and I honestly have no clue what it is. I was a little uninterested in the movie considering I was being dragged to it by my parents but once I got there I absolutely loved it. The computer animation I thought was pretty amazing considering half of the movie had to be animated since it was a whole new world with whole new creatures. I loved the characters and I loved the way the guardians magic was presented (I honestly have no clue how to word this so Im just gonna flow with it) and it honestly made me feel like a kid again. I went home wishing I was a freaking wizard. It makes me really sad that it apparently flopped on the market because a sequel would be really cool. Now dont criticize me since I have no opinion on the game at all and probably have no clue what Im talking about but the movie I thought was great. Really epic and entertaining. Reply Thijs Leppink says June 24 2016 at 626 pm As a fan of Blizzard games I tried watching this movie with an unbiased look. While I think its a good movie I also saw some flaws worth mentioning. Some scenes seem to come out of nowhere or be rushed (the romantic scenes for example). It felt like they cut about an hour of the footage to make it a 2 hour film. The characters that are introduced also seem to be stacking up pretty fast in this movie making it hard for people unfamiliar with the lore to remember and really connect with the characters. P.s I dont know why critics are harping on about the CGI as if it were bad. It looked really good considering the races/characters are based on an already existing universe with loads of games that people know them from. All in all a good movie although it could be better if above mentioned flaws werent present. Id give it a solid 7/10 Reply David J. BRUM says June 24 2016 at 1242 am Unfortunately the critic in my opinion is out of touch....another reason why I quit reading the Variety magazine. I found the film to be very amusing and the cgi was great. I cant wait for the sequel to come out..... Reply Teng says June 23 2016 at 602 pm I got into the theater and read the reviews and thought I went to watch the wrong movie. It actually it isnt bad at all. Everyone has their own point of view so watch it first and youll know if you like it or not Reply anonymous says June 23 2016 at 338 pm This was the best movie Ive ever seen. I went to see it 3 times at the theaters and every time it seemed better than the last. You dont need to know all the lore just have an unbiased open mind to new movies and look at this from a movie perspective not a gaming perspective. My friends not into WoW watched this movie and thought it was incredible. Why are so many snobby critics giving it low reviews? Reply Bea. Williams says June 23 2016 at 915 am You guys suck and really have no taste. Warcraft brought tears to my eyes twice. Douche bags that dont know the game or lore should just keep their mouths shut.... Reply Jacovny says June 22 2016 at 257 pm Hilarious review; I quite enjoyed reading it Well done sir. Reply Jacob says June 22 2016 at 1009 am Had to stop reading when the author suggested that the depth of story in the Warcraft history cant rival Middle Earth or even Westeros. Look it up the WoW Wiki is the second largest wiki in existence second only to wikipedia. The only lore deeper than Blizzards universe is reality. Reply Wiser says June 21 2016 at 1128 pm Well deserved low rating review for an obviously bad movie. Reply Trek fayerweather says June 21 2016 at 832 pm So so good a very very good movie cant wait to see part two please say theres a part two coming i can act too would love to play in it Reply Bebe Lovez Animalz says June 23 2016 at 1156 am I agree ) Cant wait for the entrance of Lady Sylvanas...thats my girl ;) Reply Shafawn says June 21 2016 at 721 pm I play wow. Everyone I play with in the game loves the movie. I havent met anyone with a negative review of the movie or even a neutral review. Everyone loves it. Ive seen the movie and I think its awesome and I dont care what critics think. They are usually wrong Reply Bebe Lovez Animalz says June 23 2016 at 1159 am I liked it too Please ignore the negative nobodys (like dude before me) looking for their 5 minutes of hate fame...Just like we do in the game ) Reply Wiser says June 21 2016 at 1129 pm Umm... More than a few of my friends on WoW hated the movie so I dont know wtf youre talking about. Perhaps you joined the ""DURR WE LIKE BLIZZARD EVEN WHEN THEY TOSS US SHIT TO EAT"" guild. Reply Bill Davenport says June 21 2016 at 422 pm This movie is not a world of warcraft movie its a warcraft movie period. Sorry im tired of seeing reviews calling this a world of warcraft movie. the movie is set about 30 years before ""World of warcraft"" during the setting of the first ""warcraft"" game titled ""Warcraft Orcs amp; Humans"" from the mid 90s and it follows that storyline relatively close. The baby at the end that is sent off by Drakka is the leader of the Orcs in world of warcraft. just saying. As a setup for the universe this movie is definitely made for the fans and they delivered 100%. Reply Krisis says June 28 2016 at 722 am Well said As soon as he mentioned subscriber counts and 2010 I knew this author had NO clue what he was even talking about. The movie is ""WARCRAFT"" not ""World of Warcraft The Movie"". Reply Davi Piekarski de Carvalho says June 21 2016 at 309 pm ALL I CAN SEE IS THAT YOU DONT UNDERSTAND SHIT ABOUT MOVIES First the movie was made for WarCraft fans not a bunch of fat lazy asses that think they understand peanuts about movies Second the CGI critic; ok Its ageeable that the could have done better but for real? Criticizing a tecnique that Blizzard is still working to improve on starting the WC saga is easy when you have giant studios by reference. Third most of them just flamed it because its not made by one of their ""favorite directors"" (FCK IT the fans just loved it). Thats my opinion of a pissed off fan and hater of shitty critics. Reply Bebe Lovez Animalz says June 23 2016 at 1200 pm Right on man...I concur ) Reply Odin Valhalla says June 21 2016 at 1041 am Idiots ""gringos"" ....

Laughable and sad. Reply Davi Piekarski de Carvalho says June 21 2016 at 310 pm ZERO basis just a moron writing bulshit about it. Deffinately not a fan. Reply Jeff Czaplewski says June 21 2016 at 924 am I totally agree with you. Reply Le Hunt says June 21 2016 at 654 am I saw the movie and Im a 67 year old woman and I loved it. Absolutely great. Reply Jeff Czaplewski says June 21 2016 at 926 am My wife is 65 and loved it as well Reply Ricardo says June 20 2016 at 938 am Looks like someone did not watch the movie. Cant even summarize the movie right. Half of the summary is just factually wrong. Looks like the anti warcraft circlejerk continues Reply Jeff Czaplewski says June 20 2016 at 929 am Are you serious? I thought this movie was better than the Star Wars last flick. And the 3D effects were better too. Reply spotliteguy says June 20 2016 at 653 am ""...never meant to have the narrative depth..."" Did you even do your research? There is SO much lore and story in the Warcraft universe. Yet again another critic needlessly bashing the film. So strange that every ""critic"" on every site posts bad reviews and yet the audience seems to love it. Reply Sumet says June 20 2016 at 537 am You mention World of Warcraft has lost subscribers from 2010 you do realise WoW was released in 2005 and has been the king of MMORPGS for 10+ years. You seemed to have left that part out. Reply Wiser says June 21 2016 at 1131 pm And you factually are a delusional fanboy that thinks WoW is the greatest no matter what lmao. I play WoW too but im under no delusions about the game. It has plenty of flaws and is nowhere near the King of MMOs but it is fun and I like the old lore (which is why I still play the game). Reply CodeKiller says June 20 2016 at 313 am ""It shouldnt take a mage to foresee that this pricey and preposterous adaptation of an online gaming phenomenon was preordained for artistic mediocrity."" Do you know Warcraft is NOT an online game ? Stupidity has no limit... Sadly... Reply noob2root says June 19 2016 at 439 pm I get that this reviewer didnt like the movie but his criticism boils down to little more than ""I didnt like it."" Hes entitled to his opinion but if youre looking for a fair and objective reviewer look elsewhere. Reply Michael says June 19 2016 at 1051 pm Totally agree Reply Josiah says June 19 2016 at 413 pm What is with the band wagon mentality with this film? I am getting so sick of the whining gaming community. They are ripping this film apart without cause. I havent ever played the game and I am glad because I dont have to associate with knit picky people who do. If I had listened to the comments made by people about this movie I would have never gone to seen it. If I hadnt I would not have seen such a good fantasy film. This movie has been so much better than others and I dont know why it is being so brutalized. And I for one found it so refreshing to watch a movie where we dont actually know who is going to die Unlike ALL the Marvel movies ( which I do adore FYI) and the Hobbit. Which if youve read the book you will know that it is NOTHING like the films. But you dont hear the book lovers whining about the fact that 50% of what happened in the film was never in the book. Give Warcraft a chance people It has the power to grow even stronger if we just make some positive comments and stop harping on about every possible thing we dont like Reply anonymous says June 23 2016 at 343 pm What do you mean ""whining gaming community""? 90% of WoW players love this movie. The ones bashing the movie are the snobby critics. As an ex WoW player I loved this movie and even my friends who dont play WoW loved it. Reply Dinosaur Pirate says July 23 2016 at 1027 am They play WoW. Standa to reason they would enjoy a garbage film as well. Abraham Reyes says June 19 2016 at 324 pm I thought the movie was great The Warcraft Universe can almost be as big as the Star Wars Universe. Imagine what critics wouldve said when SW Episode IV came out back in 1977 if it wouldve been Episode I instead. Its certain that Blizzard couldve released a movie of a more intresting part of the Warcraft timeline but I guess because they were trying to be objective and not just to please fans they started right from the ""beginning"" (well at least of the Orc-Human war) just to explain about it. As for visual effects what do people want? Really For an orc to jump out of the screen? Im not sure if its a boicot against the franchise but these kind of reviews just closes doors to other movies from this great Company that tries to deliver its best. Theyve even cancelled some of their video games because theyd thought they couldve been failures at their times (Starcraft Ghost to name one of them) Reply Mantis Toboggan says June 19 2016 at 320 pm You can tell this review is garbage because he seems to imply avatar is actually a good movie. But if youve seen fern gully avatar is garbage. Reply Yessy B. says June 28 2016 at 733 am Avatar was an AMAZING movie what are you talking about? Why cant both FernGully and Avatar be good? Why does one have to be garbage just because you feel another movie is better? Reply Npkden says June 19 2016 at 308 pm The movie was actually very goodIm tired of idiots like him who try to put down a movie unfairly. He was so obviously biased against the movie before even seeing it. My recommendation for those who read this review without watching the movie is too watch it WITHOUT any biasgive this movie a chanceit deserves your 2h and 3m. Reply David J Hirn says June 19 2016 at 220 pm Geoff Get a job and stop pretending to be a film critic. I am so tired of duds like you bringing a movie cast and director to their knees. I saw the movie and it was delightful. Dubs like you bring a series to an end. Reply Andy C says June 20 2016 at 656 am Couldnt agree more Reply Dominick Albino says June 19 2016 at 137 pm I disagree entirely with the author of this article. Warcraft was an amazing movie that seems to be ahead of its time. The movie obviously cant capture the entire lore of the WarCraft franchise but I believe that this movie does well to dig its roots in the film industry. I have never played a world of Warcraft game in my life but this movie captured my attention whole heartedly And has attracted me to its original lore. As the author of this article stated when talking about Garona her persona and looks were far from a ""sci fi garbage bin"" and I think its ridiculous that he compares it to sucker punch and the spirit. For those reading my comment I do urge u to give the film a shot because I promise u unless you go to theaters with a bitter taste in ur mouth you will without a doubt enjoy the movie. Reply DAVID M says June 18 2016 at 536 pm As a film reviewer/critic I imagine its a difficult task staying objective to the tastes of all readers when you review from your perspective. Having said that I would humbly ask how movie watchers who enjoy Fantasy Syfy and Action/Adventure films are supposed to get an accurate review of our type of entertainment? When I go to see films I want outstanding special effects and visuals that make me forget real world responsibilities and constraints. I want to ""turn my brain off"" and say ""ooooh aaaah"" until the movies end. I do not care much for dialogue story line or high-talent acting as much as I care I was entertained visually. I cannot be the only person who feels this way nor do I believe my point of view is very far outside of mainstream movie watchers everywhere. Your thoughts are greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance. Reply Raz says June 21 2016 at 1000 pm Most sci fi and fantasy fans I know still want depth and clever writing. Youre just perpetuating the negative stereotypes about both genres in suggesting that they need only be all style no substance. Also theres no such thing as an ""accurate"" review. Movie critiques are inherently subjective. I suspect that most people having a fit here (who probably never visited Variety until the Warcraft movie) would consider anyone that didnt fanboy over it ""inaccurate."" Reply Yessy B. says June 28 2016 at 740 am Not necessarily Raz. This author has ZERO clue what he is even talking about in terms of what the movie is based off of yet you want us to take this review seriously because you claim its ""fanboy-ism""? I went into the theater almost guaranteeing disappointment because of the amount of disappointment I had for the ONLINE game as of recently... and I was surprised at how detailed it was in terms of the story. Maybe get your head out your ass so you can actually see why people are upset instead of making untrue claims on how the only people who can POSSIBLY dislike this review are ""most likely fanboys"". My wife liked the movie more than I did and she doesnt even play it. James Case says June 18 2016 at 232 pm I dont play the game its based on but my family and I loved the movie. Critics were way off on this one. I hope there is a number 2. Reply Ron Burke says June 18 2016 at 1133 am Actually it wasnt an epic fail as it has almost doubled its budget worldwide. Luckily people in China arent swayed by these irresponsible critic reviewers. Just lazy and clearly biased form the start. Somehow the masses dont agree with the critic ""experts"" because user scores on IMDB rotten tomatoes and metacritic have the movie at a 7-8 but they all must be stupid. Reply wiggins says June 18 2016 at 951 am Perhaps before writing a review the critic should have done his research. IMO they did a very nice job at keeping the characters true to the game which would be important if thats the crowd of movie goers they were trying to attract. They also did a nice job tying the story (which encompasses 3 books) together in a 2 hour timeframe. They did sway off the lore a bit but thats understandable if they wanted to get people who didnt know the lore to understand what was going on. This movie was well made something I (a non-movie goer) would see again. 2 thumbs up job well done (and it appears over 87% of people who saw the movie would agree with me). The critic might want to expand his mind a bit. Reply B-4 says June 18 2016 at 801 am In your opinion the movie is a fail well what makes you think your opinion means anything anyway? people need to go see the movie and decide for themselves.

TWITTER 6/10/2016 Travis Fimmel Paula Patton and state-of-the-art digital animation topline a long-in-development game-based movie. Ten years after game maker Blizzard Entertainment announced its intention to take the megahit multimedia property Warcraft to the big screen it arrives in a striking blend of pricey practical and digital effects. As with many ""high fantasy"" epics once you get past the costumes and lingo the abracadabra and inevitable elves the movies story is as simple as its visuals are elaborate. Beneath the richly textured layers of motion capture animation and 3D modeling lie the basics conflict survival family loyalty. While the enormity of the undertaking is evident in every frame of the sci-fi medieval-ish action saga director Duncan Jones manages for the most part to keep it from lumbering. With an emphasis on craft over war the characters are front and center and those that are partly digital creations are among its most memorable. They have heart. But if youve never played Warcraft the game can you care about Warcraft the movie? Given the ardent global following of the franchise will it matter? For non-aficionados the two-hour experience could be more concise but its no ordeal. Neither though is it consistently involving. If you havent already invested in the self-serious mythology it can feel borderline camp if not downright dull -- or both as when an uncredited Glenn Close intones platitudes from on high about darkness and light. Yet theres no question that its a breakthrough in both storytelling and artistry for features based on video games. And compared with another medieval-ish tale the soporific Hobbit trilogy this international production is a fleet and nimble ride likely to conquer overseas box offices and make a solid stand stateside. With three films on Jones resume the exponential growth of the budgets and fictional universes at his command is notable. The built-in muchness of the new material along with its body-slamming battles (what the MPAA calls ""extended sequences of intense fantasy violence"") makes it a far cry from his minimalist Moon. In that film and Source Code the trippy intersection of technology and human identity was Jones subject. Here its his method with leaps in CGI and motion capture on the order of Avatars seven years ago and just as dazzling in their artifice. The screenplay credited to Jones and Charles Leavitt (Blood Diamond) tells the origin story of the war between humans and orcs a race of green-blooded giants. The orcs have invaded Azeroth a planet where humans dwarves and other humanoids live in peace but with standing armies at the ready led by the brave Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel) scarred in body and soul. As the bass rumble of voiceover by the orc chieftain Durotan (Toby Kebbell) explains ""Our world was dying and I had to find my clan a new home."" Durotan is a fair and revered leader with exceptionally expressive eyes. Soon after the orcs arrive on Azeroth -- through an otherworldly birth canal of sorts that prefigures the birth of Durotans son -- the chieftain becomes an insurgent against the orcs de facto leader the warlock Guldan (Daniel Wu). Gul-dan practices a malignant brand of magic that spares no one not even his loyal war chief Blackhand (Clancy Brown) and wreaks havoc throughout the story. But the nature of his powers is made hauntingly clear when he casually extracts the life force from one of his many prisoners a masterfully realized bit of horror imagery. Along with his dauntless wife Draka (Anna Galvin) and steadfast second-in-command Orgrim (Rob Kazinsky) Durotan seeks an alliance with humans. Besides the warrior Lothar Azeroths main players are the gallant King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper wisely underplaying); his dignified wife Lady Taria (Ruth Negga likewise); and the ultimate mage Medivh (Ben Foster definitely not underplaying). Like many a gifted channeller of powerful forces Medivh is paying the price and in the process providing the movies most extravagantly hammy moments. The humongous golem hes sculpting in his isolated tower is the first red flag that hes several glyphs around the dark bend. A reluctant but curious young apprentice mage Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) stirs things up to Medivhs deep dismay and offers a touch of comic-sidekick relief. But its the half-orc half-human Garona (Paula Patton) who plays a pivotal role and not just as a crucial go-between in the negotiations between Durotan and Lothar who understandably falls for her. The movies female characters are few but theyre all formidable and none more full-blooded than Pattons turn as the tough Garona. Human-proportioned (her orc tusks are petite) shes a survivor -- of imprisonment and abuse born of intolerance for interspecies miscegenation. Rather than turn that into a lesson the screenplay turns it into drama. In a story whose key strength is its interest in both sides of the human-orc war Jones and cinematographer Simon Duggan strip things down in a few scenes that have the primal eloquence of classic Westerns A trip on horseback over mountains becomes an occasion for campsite confessions; a secret meeting in a desolate canyon brings mutual suspicions and unilateral betrayals into the open. The balance between those sequences and the battles with their brutal swordplay and thwacks of flesh and bone wont suit everyone and the sections where you might zone out will depend on your taste. But the movie is character-driven every step of the way. Thats why even if the world created by Jones and his talented design collaborators both old-school physical and cutting-edge digital isnt seamlessly believable so much as staggeringly crafted it casts a spell. Combining primitive textures (hides and sun-bleached bones) with the glowing whoosh of magical elements Warcraft is a big-screen 3D game that the viewer enters to the martial beats of the elegantly ominous score by Ramin Djawadi (composer of the Game of Thrones theme). Its use of multiple cameras to film the motion capture performers in the same take as those playing human characters is one of the ways that its new. And then theres Durotans eyes and Garonas grit. Dramatically and technically Warcraft gives the concept of ""hybrid"" new punch.

Imagine ""Battlefield Earth"" without the verve and you get this sludgy tedious fantasy adventure a fun-starved dud thats not even unintentionally hilarious Critics throw the term ""soulless corporate filmmaking"" around with abandon but movies like ""Warcraft"" really manage to redefine the term. A film adaptation of the hugely popular MMORPG (thats Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) this latest video game adaptation ranks near the bottom of the deadly genre. Imagine ""Battlefield Earth"" without the verve or the unintentional comedy and youve got ""Warcraft."" With his first two films ""Moon"" and ""Source Code"" director Duncan Jones took high-concept science-fiction stories and spun them into taut tales that never lost sight of their characters or the toll of the extraordinary circumstances in which theyd been placed. This time around sharing screenplay credit with Charles Leavitt (""In the Heart of the Sea"") -- based on story and characters by Chris Metzen -- hes trying to wrestle with too many characters and locations and motivations and subplots all in a movie thats clearly intended to be but the first of many. Also Read 25 Movie Stars Who Were Completely Transformed by Makeup or CGI for a Role (Photos) The result is a monument to excess both narratively and in the ubiquity of the visual effects. Unlike say ""The Jungle Book"" which was entirely artificial yet came off as completely organic its hard to lose sight of the green-screens here especially when the warlike Orc characters who boast some of the least expressive character design since the aliens in ""John Carter"" stand next to the films human beings. Those two species wind up side-by-side when the Orc wizard Guldan (voiced by Daniel Wu ""Into the Badlands"") opens up a portal between their world and the magical kingdom of Azeroth ruled over by King Llane and Lady Taria (Dominic Cooper and Ruth Negga coincidentally also co-starring in ""Preacher""). Lady Tarias brother Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel ""Maggies Plan"") is one of Azeroths great warriors although he wishes his young son werent following in his footsteps. Also Read Biggest Studio Gambles of the Summer From Ghostbusters to Ben-Hur And then theres Medivh (Ben Foster) a powerful wizard who is the Guardian of Azeroth although young mage Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer ""Pride"") suspects that something is amiss amidst the Jedi ... or rather the Kirin Tor the secret society of magic that protects the kingdom. On the other side we have the mighty Durotan (voiced by Toby Kebbell ""Fantastic Four"") a deadly Orc warrior who is nonetheless a creature of principle making his way through the portal with his pregnant wife Draka (Anna Galvin ""Smallville"") as well as human-Orc half-breed Garona (Paula Patton) whose alliances arent necessarily fixed. Theres a lot of running around and yelling and scheming and go-to-the-place-and-get-the-thing-ing but none of it is particularly entertaining; like most movie versions of games it will no doubt leave fans of the original wishing they were in charge. For the rest of us theres not even that sense of fun that comes from the sort of film that plays like a small child dumping all his action figures out on the living room carpet to battle each other. A good chunk of the disconnect can be attributed to cinematographer Simon Duggan (""The Great Gatsby"") who makes every location in ""Warcraft"" -- from the kings stately castle to the Orc forests to Medivhs magical lair -- look fairly artificial. Even if this was an attempt to emulate the online game the big-screen results offer no visual pleasure. And the generically percussive action score composed by Ramin Djawadi (""Game of Thrones"") doesnt help much either. Also Read How Chinas Wanda Buying Jurassic World Producer Legendary Will Change Hollywood The cast seems mostly adrift with only Schnetzer giving what might be considered an actual performance. The usually reliable Foster is reduced to gadding about like a prog-rock Jesus in a series of robes that make him look like hes posing for the side of someones van and poor Paula Patton gets saddled with a sad pair of novelty-store fangs. (To her credit she makes the green body makeup work; if the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever expands to include superhero-with-a-law-degree She-Hulk were looking at a real contender here.) ""Warcraft"" promises or threatens sequels but then so did ""Super Mario Bros."" And come to think of it if forced to watch either of these video-game movies a second time Id probably vote for the plumbers. Email 25 Movie Stars Who Were Completely Transformed by Makeup or CGI for a Role (Photos) Youd be forgiven for not realizing that the villain in ""X-Men Apocalypse"" is played by none other than Oscar Isaac given all the blue makeup that is caked on his face.

The Academy Awards created the ""Makeup and Hairstyling"" award in 1981 because of this movie.Paramount/Getty ImagesUnlike the other folks on this list Andy Serkis is really best known for his motion capture performances. Gollum in the ""Lord of the Rings"" films was the big one but hes been remarkable beneath a CGI overlay a number of other times including ""King Kong"" and the two most recent ""Planet of the Apes"" films.
