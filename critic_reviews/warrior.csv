Joel Edgerton is Brendan a father and fighter-turned-teacher struggling in Pittsburgh. Meanwhile former Marine Tommy (Tom Hardy) trains for the same martial arts title. Both need the money and they have the same father Paddy (Nick Nolte).Warrior has many things going for it not least its cast. Edgerton is supremely sympathetic as the cash-strapped father while Hardys in his element as the strong silent type and Noltes on fine growling form as a repentant alcoholic. The fight scenes are well choreographed and suspenseful. Plotwise the film is on less solid ground relying on cliche and coincidence with backstory holes that feel more like editing errors than subtleties. When someone orders Tommy to hand over his pills thats the first and last we hear of any drug problem. This doesnt pack a punch like The Fighter - but its still a must for grapple fans.

The parallel will always be drawn between the two but with the exception of Bales remarkable performance Warrior is the more intreresting story I also found the on screen chemistry between Hardy and Nolte fantastic as a desperate father and a reluctant son A nod should also be directed towards the soundtrack which is excellent with the climatic final scene made all the more touching with the haunting tone of about today by The National In all it was a very welcome addition to the genre and really deserved to do much better than its US box office figures it has to rank as one of the best sports movies of all time and as I stated in my opinion a superior product than the fighter with a few twists and some brutal action to keep the pace for the casual fanHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreSep 25 2011milesFeaturedbest movie of the year and many other years tooHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreSep 25 2011milesFeaturedbest movie of the year and many other years tooHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreSep 25 2011leanneFeaturedwhat a film......amazing from beginning to end.Nick Nolte shows he is still a great actor but all i can say is thomas hardy makes the film.The fighting scenes are unbelievable and the story is also touching and tearjerking.A film for both girls and boys if you like your fighting films.....Thats if you can actually concentrate on what is actually going on as Tom Hardys beautifulness is rather distractingHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreSep 25 2011leanneFeaturedwhat a film......amazing from beginning to end.Nick Nolte shows he is still a great actor but all i can say is thomas hardy makes the film.The fighting scenes are unbelievable and the story is also touching and tearjerking.A film for both girls and boys if you like your fighting films.....Thats if you can actually concentrate on what is actually going on as Tom Hardys beautifulness is rather distractingHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreSep 25 2011IanFeaturedA film that succeeds just despite its many faults. You can imagine the pitch for the film. Its Rocky for the modern generation with MMA replacing boxing a disillusioned ex marine and his brooding brother and a father whose relationship with his sons has been ruined by drink and domestic violence. Yet sobriety and Jesus saved him. Thats the problem in a film that has just too many subplots that are thrown in with no real explanation and make for a messy film that reallyonly gets going until the fighting starts. We have the misselling of sub prime mortgages to a family with no apparent ability to support their lifestyle of a big house and two cars; the failures of the American health care service ruining the finances of a young family; a father who drunk and apparently beat the boys dead mother; there is her un resolved cancer death that apparently came between the brothers; the jealousy between the elder brother and the younger golden child; the unaccounted for Olympic dream and why did he join up; the non developed military hero story and the friendly fire death; the relationship between the elder brother who gave up fightng for a family and teaching and his trainer / best friend with subtle homo erotic undertones; the unorthodox yet inspiring rebel teacher. A film that would be much better with a third of the plots and much more storytelling. Count the cliches because they just keep coming with a redemptive reuniting ending. It succeeds just despite the chaos around it.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreSep 23 2011Trey n DeamFeaturedFilm took best part of hour to really see the great action fighting. Didnt think Nick N (the dad) really had any real part and a better story line could have been used than a broken family but it did display the real pain and trauma soldiers marines suffer after and during their service/fighting. 1orth the watch but dont worry if yu running late to see it.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreSep 23 2011john o sullivanFeaturedthe film starts with the national on the soundtrackmelville on audiobook and nolte on camera how can it fail? well the next 120 minutes of badly directedwritten acted and cliched tosh is the worst film ive seen (no 40) this year then as the ending comes and goes in its faux rocky way about today by the national blares out providing a memorable coda the film doesnt deserveHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreSep 22 2011Rohne HillFeaturedOddly enough quite compelling treating the fenced octagon as a battlefield for incendiary family fallout and male catharsis really worked.

Tom Hardy is very convincing and Nick Nolte is great. What happened to Jennifer Morrison? Has she shrunk? The fighting scenes are great but some other bits like a physics teacher teaching some principle by getting his students to hit things comes across a bit naive and the motivation of the teacher character to risk his life is daft - what because he wants to live in a big house instead of a small one? It was fairly enjoyable mainly towards the end but overall the stars are for the acting..Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/88847/warrior.html,200,warrior0,warrior,timeout

Chuck Zlotnick/Lionsgate hide caption toggle caption Chuck Zlotnick/Lionsgate Contagion Director Steven Soderbergh Genre Thriller Running Time 105 minutes Rated PG-13 for disturbing content and some language (Recommended) Warrior Director Gavin OConnor Genres Drama Sports Running Time 139 minutes Rated PG-13 for sequences of intense mixed martial arts fighting some language and thematic material (Recommended) Contagion is about a flu epidemic that causes millions of deaths Warrior about sibling rivalry in a working-class family. The former is a disaster epic writ surprisingly small the latter a domestic drama writ larger than youd think. Both prove effective both have intriguing structures; its a good week for movie nuts. Youd have to call the task Steven Soderbergh set himself in Contagion a daunting one He has to show a single case of bird/bat/swine flu morphing into a worldwide pandemic. No earthquakes volcanoes hurricanes. Basically he has to scare us to death with something we cant see. And while hes doing that he also has to keep us interested in whether that something we cant see is affecting specific people we arent going to get to know -- because lets be frank theyre almost all going to die as soon as we meet them. Old-school disaster-movie star casting helps. You already know say Gwyneth Paltrow and you probably dont want to see her character foaming at the mouth any more than her hubby played by Matt Damon does. Youll remember her when she shows up in flashbacks later too; stars make for helpful shorthand. But Soderbergh who put plenty of famous faces through their paces in Oceans 11 hasnt turned the search for a flu vaccine into Potions 11. Rather hes using his stars to anchor the screenplays ideas. Damon is Family solid and dependable; Kate Winslet is Research selfless and determined. Laurence Fishburne is Government with all the strengths and drawbacks that implies. And when irresponsible blogger Jude Law who represents all things alarmist meets dogged scientist Elliot Gould who is all things rational you know whose side youre on. ""Blogging is ... graffiti with punctuation"" taunts Gould. ""Theres informed discussion on the blogosphere"" responds Law ""that this is a biological weapon."" i Marion Cotillard plays a researcher for the World Health Organization in Contagion. Claudette Barius/Warner Bros. hide caption toggle caption Claudette Barius/Warner Bros. Marion Cotillard plays a researcher for the World Health Organization in Contagion. Claudette Barius/Warner Bros. With this sort of snappy writing the screenplay makes Soderberghs macro point -- that speed can be dangerous both in viral transmission and in transmission of unhelpful ideas -- work on a micro level. It takes less than a minute at the beginning of Contagion before youre thinking about viral transmission noticing the things people touch onscreen -- a cup handle a coin. As for idea transmission? Just note how anxious you are to suppress that little cough you came into the theater with so as not to alarm the folks sitting near you. Theres nothing quite like bumping elbows in a crowd to make this movies point about panic. (And to establish that Contagion is not perhaps the ideal date movie -- at least not if youre hoping for more than a goodnight fist-bump.) Warrior takes the opposite approach in almost every respect. Its a very small very blunt blue-collar Pittsburgh story with a lot on its mind about what working-class folks are up against these days. Its story centers on two estranged brothers neither of whom can stand their alcoholic dad whos growled into vibrant life by Nick Nolte. Iraq-war vet Tommy as played by Tom Hardy is damaged goods -- angry brutal quite literally spoiling for a fight. His brother Brendan played by Joel Edgerton is at the other end of the spectrum family-oriented a high-school physics teacher who only enters the ring against the wishes of his wife because theyre about to lose their home to the bank and he cant see another way out. You hear the fight-movie cliches piling up no? Wife who has no say battling brothers everything riding on the big match. Later theres a scary Russian fighter training montages -- this is not a movie to go to for plot surprises. The filmmakers have clearly read the Old Testament. And seen Rocky. Still writer-director Gavin OConnor who penned the script for Miracle -- the story of a legendary underdog victory by the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team -- is becoming the cinemas go-to guy for whipping up sports excitement and here he makes mixed martial arts look appropriately visceral as he turns sibling rivalry into a spectator sport. He also gets the family and social dynamics right. These guys say theyre fighting for the big prize but in the movies scheme of things theyre fighting to get back a little of whats been taken from them -- by the recession by their father by life. As a result Warrior ends up feeling a lot bigger than you expect it to.

But the picture is a slam dunk. I mean a ground-and-pound double-leg takedown. Itas really gripping. The brothers Brendan and Tom Conlon are played by Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton; their father Paddy sober now by Nick Nolte. These actors are so deep into their roles that they might be controlling the movies palette the colors drained the light from the side leaving hollows on faces and pockets of darkness. The screen is wide but the actors are close. Hardys Tom is the scary one. He turns up swilling whiskey at the doorstep of the dad (his former martial-arts trainer) he hasnt seen in fourteen years. Layer upon layer of bitterness and rage seem to have added to his bulk giving him thick lips and a thicker neck. He moves toward his opponents like a tank. He pummels them slams them against the floor and leaves them insensible striding just as quickly out of the ring. Hes aloof untouchable and yet he has come to his father for help -- but more it seems to pummel the man emotionally to remind him what he did to his wife and children. (""Must be hard to find a girl who can take a punch nowadays."") Brendans story is especially preposterous. A former UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) contender he tells his wife (Jennifer Morrison) -- who has forbidden him from fighting -- that hes working some nights as a bouncer. But foreclosure looms and he makes more in a night in the ring than in two months of bouncing. Hes the kind of wrestler who gets punched and kicked and slammed around and looks like hes finished and then somehow scissor-legs his opponents to the mat and finishes them off. Brendan hates his dad too but unlike his brother hes functional. What happened fourteen years ago to make one brother move across the country with his mom and the other to stay with his dad? Thats the focus of Warriors intense confrontations in some ways even more intense than the ones in the ring. But the ring scenes are mighty spectacles. Id never seen mixed martial arts but it looks as if you can do all the stuff youd get disqualified for in boxing and (even) wrestling -- a bloody free-for-all. The monster the brothers will face in Atlantic City is a Russian called Kobe. Brendans pal who runs the local gym tells him ""You got a better shot at starting a boy band."" The script is peppered with clichA(c)s split-screen training montages. That Russian. ""Im not gonna watch you fight again."" ""How much abuse can one man take?"" And Toms trajectory -- hes a criminal but also a hero -- would make even Stallone giggle. But Hardy and Edgerton are fiercely credible and Nolte is indelible a broken giant guilt bleeding through his skin and unable to escape into booze the actors voice no longer just gravelly but somewhere between the gravel pit and the pit of hell. Warrior doesnt have the range the surprise the messy originality of that other brothers-in-the-ring movie The Fighter. But it has a rich classical Hibernian gloom and the brutality is an extension of the brothers inner turmoil Tom must wreak vengeance Brendan must be beaten down before he can rise. OConnor makes the violence truly cathartic -- the only way for two men to break through and reach each other. The movie leaves you a wreck -- yet pumped.

The advertising promises sweaty fighters in a ring but director Gavin OConnor (also one of three credited writers) starts with a quiet scene of father-son intrigue shot with gritty grainy intensity. In blue-collar Pittsburgh a brooding hothead in a hoodie swigs from a bottle while taunting the abusive alcoholic father he hasnt seen in a long time. Paddy (Nick Nolte) claims to have been sober three years but Tommy (Tom Hardy) isnt buying it. He prowls the room; at any second it seems this panther on steroids might crack Paddys head open with that bottle. Hatred sets the stage. Like The Fighters clan the Conlons are a fighting family in all respects. Tommy was a wrestling champ as a teen Paddy was a boxer and his coach and the prodigal sons agenda includes asking Paddy to coach him again. Paddys elder son Brendan (Joel Edgerton who played the nicest crook of the gang in Animal Kingdom) is a mild-mannered much-loved high school physics teacher by day; at night he fights for money in less-than-glamorous locations such as the parking lot of a strip club. He and his wife Tess (Jennifer Morrison) are threatened with foreclosure hence the moonlighting. One brother spoiling for a fight the other fighting to save his home what are the chances theyll end up in a ring together? Good -- too good. Sparta dubbed ""The War at the Shore"" and carrying a 5 million purse could have fights to the death -- especially once Russian UFC legend Koba (Olympic gold medalist Kurt Angle) announces hell be a Spartan too. Hes a mammoth of a man almost comically brutal-looking. Its hard to fathom how Tommy or Brendan could take him on -- and Brendan has plenty to live for. Hes angry with his dad too but more civilized about it. He shuts rather than slams the door when Paddy comes round to share the news of Tommys return. ""Just a nice old man"" he says to his daughter when she asks about the forlorn fellow on their front lawn. Warriors three principle characterizations are compelling -- Nolte in particular gives a tempered performance as the shambling sad-eyed wreck of a dad -- but not enough to mask the films lesser elements. The story darts around too much over to Texas where a war widow in El Paso gives background for Tommys motivation; and off to Iraq for more backstory. The resulting sense of fracture and distraction is only heightened by OConnors foray into a six-frame split screen for a training montage. (it is too playful a gimmick to match the films sobriety.) The looming contrivance of brother fighting brother can almost be overlooked. Its too much but hey if OConnor wants to go Biblical at least hes being bold and what he delivers in the home stretch is if not plausible touching. Its harder to swallow the central contradiction of Tommy asking Paddy to coach him. He hates the guy so much he doesnt want him to bring him a cup of coffee in the morning but hell spend day and night training with him? Theres a line meant to explain it -- about it being better to be trained by ""the devil you know"" than not -- but the scenes between Paddy and Tommy turn into a sulk fest. Hardy wears Tommys emotional bruises all over his face but he goes so far into the wounded-animal act that he becomes remote. In accent the British Hardy channels no less than Sylvester Stallones Rocky who hailed from Philadelphia. But instead of wanting to see Tommys arms raised high in victory the impulse is to root for him to get a brain scan in case some of that damage is physical rather than emotional.

Theyre each railing against their respective pasts their elusive futures intimate regrets and bureaucratic aggravations and its this character-driven emphasis that gives full weight to the emotional punches of Miracle director Gavin OConnors latest underdog anthem. When Tommy (Tom Hardy) arrives on the Pittsburgh doorstep of Paddy (Nick Nolte) the formers surprised by the latters newfound sobriety and the latter by the formers appearance after years of estrangement. Tommy enlisted same as his dad did and whatever happened over there he doesnt want to talk about. He doesnt want to talk about much really. He doesnt even want to forgive his father for tearing their family apart with his alcoholic carelessness. The former wrestling champ simply wants to train and fight like he used to and if it earns him a place in the heavily promoted Sparta tournament -- where the cash prize is a cool 5 million -- then so be it. Little do Tommy and Paddy realize that younger brother/other son Brendan (Joel Edgerton) is equally drawn to the dough. Hospital bills for one of his two daughters have piled up while the bank threatens to foreclose on their Philly home forcing the seemingly mild-mannered high school teacher to take up his old mixed martial arts habits after hours. His wife (Jennifer Morrison) isnt happy to see fresh bruises crop up and neither is the school administration (led by Kevin Dunn) so when Brendan is consequently suspended without pay the Sparta tournament seems like the only answer to their financial woes. It hardly seems like a surprise that Brendan and Tommy will indeed face one another in the ring (or the octagon or the cage or what-have-you; underneath the MMA trappings this is essentially a boxing movie) but what the three leads pull off here is a commendable lowercase counterpoint to the all-caps blue-collar confrontations of last years The Fighter. The manifestations of desperation and determination between Nolte Hardy and Edgerton are as quietly divergent as they are equally captivating. Although Id keyed on Edgerton most recently in crime dramas The Square and Animal Kingdom Ive yet to see him issue equal amounts warmth and physicality like this. Hardy meanwhile hardly says a word masking substantial remorse with one fierce assault after another. The latter already proved himself an outstanding showman in Bronson but here he retreats effortlessly into a feral sort of state and manages to wield mere eye contact every bit as effectively as his fists. That leaves Nolte as the man responsible for driving the siblings apart and aching for forgiveness in his later days. His character is partial to an audiobook of Moby Dick constantly chasing what he may never get and nearly every scene with Nolte in it is akin to Mickey Rourkes turn in The Wrestler tapping into a sense of shame so potent that the result is heartbreaking more often than not. Any of these three men could be the focus of their very own redemption story and yet OConnors screenplay (co-written by Anthony Tambakis and Cliff Dorfman) isnt too overcrowded for its own good even as the running time pushes 220. The cumulative impact is instead ideally multiplied as blatant antagonists give way to unbeatable odds unbearable circumstances unstoppable forces. That isnt to say that Warrior isnt without its fair share of corny contrivances whether its the hoary commentators spelling out the stakes of the final matches the dismissive colleagues who end up cheering Brendan on or the questionable military procedure that allows Tommy to remain in the fight. To its credit at least this isnt a film where the aforementioned sick kid is currently cloyingly ill watching Daddy do his damnedest while awaiting a critical surgery and this isnt a film where a character going off his meds results in hardcore scenery-chewing (although one characters moment of relapse does verge on the brink of melodramatic hysterics if not crossing entirely into it). The beats are familiar the stakes are high the fights are brutal and the rewards are just. Warrior is ultimately as much about a family forced to pummel through their demons and their doubts as it is about a country working through its setbacks in the wake of conflict abroad and collapse at home. Its less about going from rags to riches and more about getting back up in order to simply get by.

By Peter Rainer Film critic September 9 2011 Save for later Saved Tommy (Tom Hardy l.) and brother Brendan (Joel Edgerton) square off in the drama Warrior. Lionsgate          View Caption About video ads View Caption of ""Warrior"" which is being promoted as another ""Rocky"" begins promisingly - that is to say it doesnt seem like another ""Rocky.""Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) a mumbly muscle-bound prodigal son makes a surprise visit home to the father Paddy (Nick Nolte) he hasnt seen in 14 years. A recovering alcoholic whose brutality drove away his entire family Paddy wants to make it up to his son. Tommy still seethes with resentment but he wants to train for Sparta a mixed martial arts event with a 5 million purse. He remembers that back in the day there was no better fighting coach than Paddy.It turns out theres another son Brendan (Joel Edgerton) Tommys older brother who has been estranged from both Tommy and Paddy. Theres a lot of estrangement in ""Warrior."" If there wasnt there wouldnt be all that reconciliation later on. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Brendan is a high school physics teacher and former fighter who cant make enough to hold onto his house so he too decides to enter Sparta. You can see where this is going. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? I was hoping for a while that ""Warrior"" would be the kind of movie that undercuts its own conventions. The opening sequences between Tommy and Paddy have a gritty surly realism and mumbly as they are theyre well written by director Gavin OConnor and his coscreenwriters Anthony Tambakis and Cliff Dorfman. But no - this turns into the kind of movie that confirms our expectations instead of confounding them.This predictability has its pleasures - up to a point. ""Warrior"" passes that point around the halfway mark when Tommys checkered past as an Iraq war veteran comes to the fore and Tommy and Brendan cross swords and Paddy who has stayed sober for a thousand days suddenly ... do I need to say?OConnor films the fight scenes and the fight training scenes leading up to them with the requisite oomph. He also works well with the actors although Hardys Brandoesque mannerisms might have been toned down. It wasnt a masterstroke to have Paddy periodically listen to ""Moby-Dick"" on his earphones - are we supposed to think that hes Ahab or the white whale? - but Nolte against all odds turns this walking stereotype into a living breathing man. He effectively underplays Paddys brawly side his need for remorse his shame.The filmmakers have no such qualms. ""Warrior"" becomes increasingly shameless until by the end with the big fights fought we are clearly meant to rise as one and applaud the indomitability of the human spirit. But the only indomitable thing about ""Warrior"" are its cliches. Grade B- (Rated PG-13 for sequences of intense mixed martial arts fighting some language and thematic material.)

Comments click to enlarge Warrior Recommended Rated PG-13  139 minutes  2011 The charismatic Tom Hardy (Bronson) stars as an angry Iraq war veteran who returns to working-class Pittsburgh to confront his recovering alcoholic father (Nick Nolte) but also to win his help in training for a mixed martial arts tournament. The situation is further complicated when his brother (Joel Edgerton of Animal Kingdom) who can barely support his family as a high school physics teacher enters the same competition. Directed by Gavin OConnor (Miracle Pride and Glory) this high-powered sports melodrama benefits from its strong male leads a sinewy narrative and the maverick attitude of MMA. But for all the contemporary references its essentially a spin on the story of Cain and Abel which may be the reason it feels timeless.

STEPHEN COLE The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 09 2011 1201AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The fight film Warrior is a rousing entertainment for the new depression. Only instead of breadlines and dance marathons we get bank foreclosures and an epic 48-hour mixed marital arts tournament in Atlantic City - the War on the Shore. Winner gets 5-million. Our warriors are the Conlons Pittsburgh palookas with more troubles than Ireland. Ex-boxer dad Paddy (Nick Nolte) is a recovering alcoholic with a thousand days sober - one for every bad memory. Son Brendan (Joel Edgerton) a former fighter with concussion issues is a punch away from oblivion. Hes a high-school physics teacher now with a beautiful wife and home and two young daughters that love him. Movies Warrior The official trailer But one of the little girls has a heart defect which means sky-high medical bills. And the familys beautiful home? Its about to be taken away by the bank. Brother Tommy (Tom Hardy) is the apple of Paddys eye. The old man trained the kid. A sure-fire champ everyone figured. Then the apple got bruised a broken mother who died in his arms ... Iraq ... Tommy wants the 5-million sure but hes really in the big tournament so he can beat up the world. Yeah the movie piles it on. Warrior is a weirdly affecting hybrid a 100-proof melodrama thats two-thirds Sylvester Stallone and one-third Eugene ONeill. Think Rockys Long Days Journey into Night. Our Long Day begins with Tommy showing up on Paddys doorstep. He wants his father to train him again. More than anything though Tommy wants to get back at his family. Every day he batters away at the old man with memories. Combination punches calculated to push Paddy to the bottle. Brother Brendan is almost as mad at the old man. He wont even let him in his house. And so like the Tyrones in ONeills play the Conlons stalk about airless rooms probing each others wounds trapped in the past. Still make no mistake this is an action movie one that validates (it sure glamorizes) mixed marital arts confirming its status as this generations blood sport of choice. On the way to Atlantic City the Conlon boys kick and punch their way from dingy corner gyms through the strip club amateur fight night circuit. Eventually theyre YouTube and ESPN sensations. Writer-director Gavin OConnor ( Miracle) shrewdly negotiates the old Thirties-Forties boxing movie formula establishing characters and motivation early on baiting us with the odd fight scene opening us up for the dramatic kill - The Big Fight finale that has us bobbing and weaving with our new-found heroes in the ring. And while Warrior provides more than a few knockout action sequences the surprise here is that the most memorable fight is a mostly improvised scene in an Atlantic City hotel bedroom where Nick Noltes Paddy beats himself up with one of his boys watching. Paddy Conlon is Noltes best part since Affliction. And Warrior needs him. Wobbly but proud irreparably damaged Paddy ups the dramatic ante in his sons obsession to be champ. Hes the Or Else that makes their quest so desperate. Just as important perhaps Noltes powerful meticulously glamour-free depiction of an alcoholic lends the fanciful fight melodrama a much needed realistic punch. Commonwealth stars both relative newcomers Joel Edgerton (Australia) and Tom Hardy (England) are almost as good as Brendan and Tommy Conlon. This guy could be the next Russell Crowe you find yourself thinking watching them work. The smart money is on Hardy who has Crowes bulky insistence and Keanu Reeves unclouded angelic face.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Director Gavin OConnor comes out swinging in this flawed but fiercely moving family drama about two feuding brothers competing in a martial-arts tournament. The script co-written by OConnor isnt always steady on its feet but the actors score knockouts. Tom Hardy the fireball star of Bronson brings animal force to Tommy Conlon an Iraq War veteran returned home to Philadelphia after 14 years. He has no use for his troubled father Paddy (an exceptionally fine Nick Nolte) who abused his late wife. But Tommy wants Daddy dearest a wrestling coach to prep him for an MMA competition that could earn him 5 million. Tommys married older brother Brendan (a very fine Joel Edgerton) also wants the prize to save his home from foreclosure. The brutal MMA action is skillfully staged. But Warrior aspires to myth. Its Cain and Abel battling it out in the face of a decidedly ungodly father before humanity goes down for the count. Strong stuff.

Starring Jennifer Morrison Tom Hardy Nick Nolte Kurt Angle Kevin Dunn Bryan Callen Joel Edgerton Jake McLaughlin Frank Grillo Liam Ferguson Director Gavin OConnor Release Opened Sep 9 2011  Editorial Review Sibling rivalry hits the arenaBy John DeForeFriday Sep 09 2011Judging from its poster - a stark black sheet on which two shirtless dudes display a dozen well-defined abs and four frightening pecs - ""Warrior"" should be just another slab of lunkhead cinema a thin story designed to fill UFC coffers and bolster the big-screen ambitions of musclemen. Dont be fooled. While ""Warrior"" does offer enough jaw-snapping action to sate any roid-ragers in the audience it works on deeper levels as well. Many cinephiles will recoil at the suggestion that its this years ""The Fighter"" but ""Warrior"" is in some ways more satisfying than David O. Russells justly celebrated film - particularly for viewers who enjoy watching great screen acting that doesnt constantly remind you of its greatness. Tom Hardy (last seen as a taciturn con man in ""Inception"") plays Tommy a black-sheep son who arrives drunk after years of absence on the Pittsburgh front stoop of his fathers house. Dad is played by Nick Nolte which is almost all you need to know As in films like ""Clean"" Noltes weathered face and remorseful eyes immediately communicate a troubled family history. Though he has been sober for nearly 1000 days Paddy Conlon was a drunk so abusive that Tommy and his mother fled to the other side of the country where the youth nursed her through terminal illness before joining the Marines. Tommys brother Brendan (Joel Edgerton recently in the grim Aussie crime film ""Animal Kingdom"") meanwhile stayed at home to be near his sweetheart. Theyre now married with kids and although they have three jobs between them (we meet him in a classroom teaching Newtons laws to high schoolers) theyre financially underwater. Their situation is so dire that Brendan who was a pro fighter before settling down has been sneaking off at night to enter parking-lot brawls where the winner earns a few hundred bucks. Independently of each other these sons of a violent home discover an opportunity to turn aggression into cash In Atlantic City the Sparta tournament will pit mixed-martial-arts combatants against one another for a 5 million prize. The tales premise - that two estranged siblings will wind up in the same worldwide championship fighting their way to the final round despite their mutual inexperience - may be implausible. But the film directed and co-written by Gavin OConnor (whose hockey story ""Miracle"" won fans in 2004) finds a way to sell it relying largely on its leads Tommy seething with resentment demolishes opponents in brutally short bouts; Brendan more cerebral but incapable of quitting endures endless abuse in the ring while waiting for a chance to pin the other fighter. Their progress to the inevitable showdown is thoroughly compelling and depicted in fight scenes so believable its a shock to learn that Hardy had no previous athletic experience. The movies script risks drawing its conflicts out too plainly The brothers contrasting training regimens (Brendan listens to Beethoven in a pristine gym while Tommy is out in the muck) get a little too much emphasis and viewers would understand the weight of Paddys personal demons even if he werent always listening to a ""Moby Dick"" audiobook. But OConnors occasional heavy-handedness is tempered by his actors restraint the storys cold industrial-town backdrop and the convincing real-world baggage each man carries. (Those back stories contribute to a two-hour-plus running time a length that gives the movie heft without feeling overlong.) The catharsis ""Warrior"" offers in the end is hard won and it will take a steely viewer not to find it gratifying however over-the-top it may be.Contains some rough language and very realistic fight-ring violence.

"Warrior review An unexceptional addition to the fight-movie genre |       NJ.com comments Warrior review An unexceptional addition to the fight-movie genre Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 09 2011 at 722 AM View/Post Comments Chuck ZlotnickTom Hardy left and Joel Edgerton as brothers who face each other in a major mixed-martial-arts contest in ""Warrior."" Too often professional fights start off with silly hype and trash talk and end in a flurry of dirty tricks low blows and shameless appeals to the crowd. Most fight films arent any different. Its still a great genre. And its fondest fans can point to exceptions -- ""Body and Soul"" ""The Set-Up"" ""The Harder They Fall"" ""Raging Bull"" and even the first ""Rocky."" But what these films have in common is a certain grittiness and a firm belief that theres more to a prizefight than the prize (remember all Rocky wanted to do at first was just ""go the distance""). Those are not the prime interests of ""Warrior."" A film as rooted in the real world as Mike Tyson the story revolves around two Pittsburgh brothers estranged for more than a decade. Both are 30-ish and in desperate need of cash. And soon they end up facing each other as competitors in a major mixed-martial-arts contest in Atlantic City. Right. Yes -- before you trot out the Williams sisters -- there are siblings who compete in the same sport. But I never believed these mugs would land two out of only 16 spots in a competition of world-famous fighters. Any more that I believed that Brendan the ""good"" brother immediately lost his union teaching job for moonlighting as a brawler. Any more that I believed that Tommy the ""bad"" brother while serving in Iraq with the Marines actually got away with ... But I get ahead of myself. Most fans will get ahead of the film too which telegraphs its punches like an aging palooka. And whose flights of fancy -- including one trainer who makes his fighters work out to the Ninth Symphony and another who carries on imaginary arguments with Captain Ahab -- would have given even Don King pause. Director Gavin OConnors last two big films were the ambitiously bleak ""Pride and Glory"" (a cop melodrama about an Irish family) and the ""U-S-A U-S-A"" crowd-pleaser ""Miracle"" (about the 1980 Olympic hockey contest). This film seems uncomfortably torn between the two. It doesnt help either that Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton are nearly interchangeable as the battling brothers. (Christian Bale went over the top in ""The Fighter"" but at least he and Mark Wahlberg were fun to watch.) Here its like watching two sides of beef tenderize each other. Luckily Nick Nolte is on hand as their failed father. There is absolutely nothing to this character -- all we know is that hes not a drunk but he used to be and he feels sorry for that. But Noltes performance is masterful marshalling together pain and regret and a slowly dawning comprehension in a single wince. But all this film has going for it besides him are its incredibly brutal fight scenes. And rather than make you marvel at mixed-martial-arts fighting all theyre likely to do is make you marvel its allowed at all. Ratings note The film contains violence substance abuse and strong language. Warrior (PG-13) Lionsgate (139 min.) Directed by Gavin OConnor. With Joel Edgerton Tom Hardy Nick Nolte.

Is there anything as sentimental and overwrought as a fight film? Movies like ""Warrior"" dont realize that pum meling kicking and mauling are things that should never be done to the tear ducts. Generic as it is the title being singular doesnt even apply to this mixed-martial arts movie which pays equal attention to two estranged brothers. Any guesses about whether theyll meet in the ring for the championship? Guess correctly and you can skip the first hour and 45 minutes of this long long sit. ""Warrior"" is a cheap exploitation picture wrapped in miles and miles of stale would-be Oscar scenes the most hilarious of which features Nick Nolte reeling around a hotel room carpeted with empty booze bottles listening to ""Moby-Dick"" on tape and crying ""Stop the ship Stop the ship"" A lot of films are 10 minutes too long. This one could have been cut by 40. As in his previous exercise in cliche and bombast the 2008 cop drama ""Pride and Glory"" writer-director Gavin OConnor seems to be working from the 1937 Warner Bros. screenwriters manual. Noltes old Irish bastard and ex-fight trainer is -- really -- called ""Paddy Conlon."" His sons sensitive family man Brendan (Joel Edgerton) and loutish bad boy Tommy (Tom Hardy) are feuding slabs of meat who hate the old man for being an abusive daddy while they were growing up. Tommy also has a strange quarrel with Brendan for staying on the East Coast to marry his girlfriend when Tommy and his mom whom Brendan didnt realize was dying fled the old man and headed west. What kind of a man is Tommy for carrying a grudge about this for years? Emotionally hes at the same level as the 10th-graders who are no longer BFFs because Nicole didnt invite Ava to her birthday party. Hoping to arrive at ""gritty"" and ""realistic"" OConnor instead gets stranded at ""dingy"" and ""dull."" The entire movie looks like it was buried in dust for six months then thrown in the dryer with a quart of 10W-40. Even if you could run a squeegee over it you wouldnt find much. The big training montage midway through the film is about as exciting as the intro sequence to the 6 oclock newscast in Columbus Ohio. Whats easier to put together than a training montage? All you need is a cool song and a decent editor. Moreover though there are some suitably rousing fights in the final act in the first 75 minutes there are only two brief warm-up bouts in which we see that yes each of the brothers can tussle. Surrounding these bits are whiny slow-paced scenes about background problems. Dudes You are in a movie called ""Warrior."" We dont need a lot of material about your day job or your mortgage. What we want to know about is how to win a mixed-martial arts fight -- one that allows kicking kneeing elbowing choking and even sitting on the other guys chest and redesigning his face along Picasso themes. The ""unorthodox"" trainer who works with Brendan teaches him to . . . um listen to lots of Beethoven. Also he keeps shouting ""Listen to the music"" and ""relax."" Relax? When a guy is stomping on your windpipe? The central characters despite the vast amount of screen time developing them never catch on. Rocky Balboa fought for pride and a need to prove himself. Brendan sheepish and depressed is getting in the ""cage"" only because he needs to save his house from foreclosure. His Adrian-like wife says things like ""You could get killed"" refuses to watch him fight then pops into the arena for the climax. Tommy who walks around hunched over like Mr. Burns is a surly muttering jerk who (as we learn late in the film) should be in prison for a crime the movie shrugs off. And the bad guys -- one Mohawked the other Russian -- seem to be there only so well know that the director has also seen ""Rocky III"" and ""IV."" Neither of these villains comes into focus either The Russian Koba doesnt even get any real dialogue. ""Warrior"" is the type of movie that tries to convince us that what were seeing is important because we keep being told its heroes have popped up on YouTube or are watched on sports TV. But in those cases the primary attraction to viewers is the notion that were witnessing reality -- unfiltered unpredictable raw. The movie is strictly machine-made as genuine as those distressed-looking ""vintage"" T-shirts they sell at Target. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next NBA makeover Read Next NBA makeover Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 46694 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 22725 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops 16495 16 dead in Texas hot air balloon crash Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

(AP Photo/Lionsgate Chuck Zlotnick) Chuck Zlotnick In this image released by Lionsgate Tom Hardy left and Nick Nolte are shown in a scene from ""Warrior."" (AP Photo/Lionsgate Chuck Zlotnick) If Tommy (Tom Hardy) has role models his estranged dad Paddy (Nick Nolte) definitely isnt one of them. Paddy used to be a mean drunk and Tommy hasnt forgotten those days of household terror. But hes also disgusted by Paddys attempts to make amends refusing to cut the old man any slack for being clean and sober. Tommy claims he actually liked his dad better before he put down the bottle.The two wouldnt even be speaking if Tommy didnt need Paddys help -- as his trainer. Tommy has the skills to win big in a mixed martial arts tournament but he needs ex-boxer Paddys wisdom. And his dad is only too happy to oblige.But someone else has his heart set on coming out on top in the competition Tommys brother Brendan (Joel Edgerton) who stands to lose his house if he doesnt get a big payday. Brendan is woefully out of shape but thats not enough to stop him. Tommy on the other hand just might be. ""Warrior"" is almost a great film. Working from an unusually literate screenplay director and co-writer Gavin OConnor (""Miracle"") clearly has the artistic sensibility to deliver a classic. Indeed ""Warrior"" starts out so promisingly that its a huge disappointment when it ultimately becomes way too predictable -- and unbelievable. Its as if ""Raging Bull"" suddenly morphed into ""Rocky.""Inevitably this film will be measured against ""The Fighter"" (2010) another tale of battling brothers. But it more than earns the comparison due in no small part to Hardys willingness to be unlikable and Edgertons fearlessness in playing a man whose desperation has been too quiet for too long. As for Nolte this is his best performance since his star turn in ""The Good Thief"" (2002). ""Warrior"" could have used a bit more guts. But its still a knockout.

(Handout) Joe Neumaier Friday September 9 2011 400 AM Title Warrior With Tom Hardy Nick Nolte. Two brothers battle for a mixed martial arts title. Director Gavin OConnor. (220) PG-13 Language violence. At area theaters.The blue-collar blood sweat and tears that spew from ""Warrior"" arent as pure as what hit the mat in last years ""The Fighter"" or even in ""Rocky"" a movie it gives a nod to.But this fictional drama about two men struggling with the anger planted in them by their abusive father has moments of power that push through a fake-out script.It also has a secret weapon a wallop of a turn from British actor Tom Hardy.Hardy (""Inception"") plays Tommy Riordan who shows up on the Pittsburgh doorstep of his aging dad Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte) after 14 years away. A feral lug who doesnt hide his disgust Tommy has come to confront his newly sober pop about the years of abuse he and his mother suffered before they fled West.Paddy living in denial in church and in his always-present audiotape of ""Moby-Dick"" just mutters an apology.Tommy asks Paddy for more though when Tommy finds his talent at the local gym knocking out a mixed martial arts champ during a sparring session. He asks Paddy to coach him for an upcoming ""Super Bowl of MMA"" as long as they only talk about training. Hungry for any connection with his son Paddy agrees.Meanwhile in Philadelphia Tommys estranged brother Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) is having a hard time making ends meet on his teachers salary so he and his wife a waitress work extra jobs. Facing foreclosure and medical bills Brendan enters mixed martial arts matches in strip-club parking lots. But there is a potential payoff that may save his house Winning the MMA Super Bowl Tommy is aiming for.The siblings seething from years of distance and resentment -- at 16 Brendan had chosen to stay with his alcoholic dad -- are on a collision course. It should be no surprise that they end up battling for the championship title.""Warrior"" directed by Gavin OConnor (""Miracle"") is filled with preposterous plot developments and dropped-in film-padding information. (Tommy it turns out deserted his company in Iraq and was an unknown war hero -- which explains why he goes by his moms maiden name. And ironic isnt it that both guys gravitatetoward mixed martial arts?) And Nolte effective for most of the film has an embarrassing scene as he drunkenly shouts at Captain Ahab and his crew.Edgerton though is impressive as a hardworking man hitting a wall in life while Hardy -- a villain in a ""Star Trek"" movie in 2002 and Batmans enemy Bane in next years ""The Dark Knight Rises"" -- is like a thing from another world. Soulful but surly his hunched intensity sits atop the furtive eyes and protective body language of a guy forever on the ropes.The final scenes of Hardy and Edgerton having it out are undeniably surprisingly moving and land a knockout punch to all of ""Warriors"" faults.Magic Moment When the brothers meet on a beach at night their reunion is filled with accusation and emotion.

The sport is mixed martial arts -- a full-contact hybrid of several styles of unarmed combat -- and the exciting brawls are brutal enough to make audiences wince.The familial saga is potent with Nick Nolte as Paddy Conlon the washed-up patriarch whose drinking and violent rages toward his wife have estranged him from the two grown sons he taught to fight at an early age.MORE Interview with Gavin OConnorTommy (Tom Hardy) left with his mom and later nursed her as she died of cancer. Deeply embittered by his fathers abuse and older brother Brendans (Joel Edgerton) perceived abandonment Tommy finds a surrogate family by joining the Marines. But he cant outrun his demons even on the battlefield. He helps a wounded platoon and emerges a hero. But in his heart he feels anything but heroic.Brendan gave up an early fighting career to teach high school and create a stable home life with wife Tess (Jennifer Morrison) and their two daughters. But when the threat of financial ruin looms he winds up taking on his younger brother.Tommy lands on the doorstep of his father now nearly three years sober. Tommy goes to the gym knocks out a prizefighter and enlists his fathers aid in getting him trained to fight. But he wants no part of the older mans too-little too-late parental efforts.About the movieWarrior   out of fourStars Nick Nolte Tom Hardy Joel Edgerton Jennifer Morrison Frank GrilloDirector Gavin OConnor Distributor Lionsgate Rating PG-13 for sequences of intense mixed martial arts fighting some language and thematic material Running time 2 hours 19 minutes Opens Friday nationwideTommy and Brendan meet in the ring in Atlantic City for whats billed as ""the Super Bowl of mixed marital arts"" which carries a 5 million purse.Yes the coincidences are fast and furious but both Edgerton and Hardy give powerful performances as damaged men. Nolte is pitch-perfect as their recovering alcoholic father. He alternates between gruff and pathetic and while we feel for the sons he wounded emotionally we sense his lonely anguish. So he takes Tommys verbal abuse and Brendans avoidance as if it were his penance.Director Gavin OConnor (Miracle) has a way with inspirational gritty sports stories. While there are melodramatic and manipulative moments the emotional conflicts take fresh turns and the physical bouts look convincing. Its a fantasy and a rather disturbing one the idea that beating people up -- even ones brother -- offers the solution to both practical and existential woes.But the movie stops short of hitting the send button on that message. Life feels as messy as it really is. While a quest for redemption underlies the raw violence recrimination still seems to trump remorse.

"""Warrior"" movie review - LA Times ENTERTAINMENT ENTERTAINMENT Movie review Warrior Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""Warrior"" is too much of a good thing. A family drama set in the ultraviolent world of mixed martial arts it shows promise but finally hits things so hard both literally and metaphorically that its hard not to feel pummeled yourself by the time its over.Which is too bad because as his earlier ""Miracle"" demonstrated director/co-writer Gavin OConnor has a gift for handling old-fashioned emotion-soaked material that has become something of a lost art. But in that film about the U.S. hockey teams stunning gold-medal victory in the 1980 Olympics OConnors melodramatic instincts were constrained by the strictures of the real story he was telling. Here OConnor and co-writers Anthony Tambakis and Cliff Dorfman have let nothing restrain them in this testosterone-fueled spectacle that celebrates men being men doing what men have to do to stay masculine. Or something.With a plot centering on the conflicts inside and outside the ring between brothers Brendan and Tommy Conlon (Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy respectively) and between the brothers and their ancient wreck of a father (Nick Nolte) ""Warrior"" showcases enough bad blood to contaminate the plasma supplies of the Red Cross. More than that the film so audaciously piles on a series of shameless head-shaking contrivances and is so happy to milk them for all theyre worth that it starts to feel like heaven help us a mixed martial arts version of ""The Help."" Yet like that venture ""Warrior"" is genuine in its pursuit of what it considers to be a resonant narrative and its two-hour 19-minute length is a testament to how seriously OConnor takes its story.Even ""Warriors"" mind-numbing violence -- inevitable in a film centering on a top-drawer mixed martial arts tourney -- is not there for its own sake alone but as a vehicle for the characters to express emotion. Whatever else you can say this film is not insincere.Things begin with a glimpse of father Paddy Conlon (Nolte) headed home from early-morning Mass in a blue-collar area of Pittsburgh. He is more than shocked to find his wreck-of-a-son Tommy popping pills and waiting for him on his front stoop.Effectively played as a creature of pure fury by British actor Hardy (memorable as the criminal protagonist of ""Bronson"") Tommy has kept himself apart from his father for 14 years and has the bitterness to prove it. Though it takes awhile for us to find out where this anger comes from Tommy is convincingly contemptuous of the old man for having turned to religion for finding AA and just for being alive. A few hundred miles away in Philadelphia brother Brendan (top Australian actor Edgerton recently seen in ""Animal Kingdom"") has what seems like a very different life. Though he hasnt seen his brother in the same 14 years and keeps his father at arms length Brendan is happily married to high school sweetheart Tess (Jennifer Morrison) and loves his job as a high school physics teacherAmericas erratic economy however is about to stab Brendan in the back. Quicker than you can say ""foreclosure"" Brendan and his wife and young daughters are underwater in their house and at risk of getting thrown into the street.As it turns out however mixed martial arts was in Brendans past and though he swore to Tess he would never again get beaten up for a living he ends up appearing in local bouts to stave off financial Armageddon.Meanwhile back in Pittsburgh Tommy a battler from the word go notices a poster for Sparta a.k.a. ""The War on the Shore"" a single-elimination winner-take-all last-man-standing MMA tournament set for Atlantic City that will offer 5 million to ""the toughest man on the planet.""Tommy so wants that money that he agrees to be trained by the old man he hates who apparently was a canny coach even while being a dreadful father. Brendan also hears about Sparta and enlists old comrade-in-arms Frank Campana (Frank Grillo) now an unorthodox instructor who likes his people to train to Beethovens ""Ode to Joy"" (really) to get him ready for the tourney.That tournament takes up the films final hour and it does not hold back in terms of savagery contrivance or emotional manipulation. Like the rest of ""Warrior"" it is effective up to a point but rushing past that point without looking back is something this film is powerless to resist.kenneth.turanlatimes.comWarriorMPAA rating PG-13 for sequences of intense mixed martial arts fighting some language and thematic materialRunning time 2 hours 19 minutesPlaying In general release Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Warrior (movie) Drama (genre) Tom Hardy American Red Cross The Help (movie) Movie review Tanner Hall Movie review Warrior Movie review Shaolin Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-warrior-20110909,0,3984040.story?track=rss",200,warrior17,warrior,latimes

I have sampled a few of your reviews now and this one pushed me right out the door. This isnt a debate of whether or not its a B+ more so one of whether or not you even paid attention to detail and nuances. This is an A or an A+. When you give movies with no depth and completely Hollywood driven scripts without substance the same or higher scores youre clearly sending a message that just because you have a website and notoriety doesnt necessarily mean you have taste. Tracysaid on Sunday August 26 2012 70923 PMI truly loved this film and I just saw it for the third time. Nick Nolte will break even the hearts of people who grew up with the likes of a person like Paddy. Joel Edgerton is quietly moving as the kind of guy any girl wishes to have as hers...brave loyal fierce kind loving. And Tom Hardy oh Tom Hardy besides being FEROCIOUS in every role he takes on...he is just so fine. This story is so moving it brought me to tears more than once. Being divorced from a raging alcoholic myself I must say the movie gets the lingering hurt felt even after someone is clean for so long just perfect. It is something you just dont forgive ever. I know. My kids dont speak to their father after years of him being sober. It is pitch perfect regarding this. Ubaysaid on Wednesday August 15 2012 125114 AMthis girl is out of her mind? did she even watch the movie??? Warrior is so much better then The Fighter and Tom Hardys role in the movie was amnaizg. I dont think anyone could have done a better job he was perfect for the role and Ive been dying to see the movie again since I saw it yesterday. This was the best movie Ive seen in years and it will bring tears to your eyes when you watch it Jaysaid on Sunday March 18 2012 24354 AMWhat a great movie loved it had me a little teary eyed in a few parts which dont usually happen. Watch it people you will love it. An A from me. JRMsaid on Friday December 30 2011 41931 PMI just saw this movie a few days ago and I cant stop thinking about it I think its far better than many critics are giving it credit for. Very moving and exciting film from start to finish. Mackenziesaid on Thursday September 22 2011 120211 AMI just finished seeing Warrior and I very much agree on what you say about the film except youre not giving enough credit to the film. This is definitely an A film and certainly one the years best films. I see oscar nominations for the film Nick Nolte and Tom Hardy. The best film Ive seen thus far this year.

Shari L. Gross Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint What if Raging Bull fought Rocky -- and they were brothers? The set-up sounds gallingly crude and derivative yet ""Warrior"" turns it into a one-two punch of gripping action and powerful drama. The films borrowing doesnt stop with its central conflict. It weaves the best elements of ""The Fighter"" ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""The Wrestler"" into a story so heartfelt and well-acted that any objections to whats been adapted from elsewhere seems to matter less as the movie goes on. The film opens in working-class Pittsburgh where Paddy Conlon 1000 days sober encounters the grown son he hasnt seen in more than a decade. Tommy who Paddy trained to a string of wrestling wins as a child moved to the West Coast with his mother when Paddys abuse drove her away. Now hes a taciturn brute who is contemptuous of his father but wants another round of fight conditioning. Tommy intends to enter the Sparta mixed martial arts competition a cable spectacular with a 5 million purse. In his travels which remain mysterious until the film discloses them he has incurred a debt of honor. The prize will settle it. Paddys older son Brendan an ex-fighter turned schoolteacher also despises his father but stayed near home to marry his high school sweetheart. Now they have a daughter with a serious heart condition and an underwater mortgage. He enters the Sparta competition to heal his little girl and avoid foreclosure. Inevitably the long-separated brothers almost strangers will square off against each other. Will the victor be Tommy fueled by inconsolable rage or Brendan martyring himself to protect his family? Director Gavin OConnor who worked magic in the Herb Brooks hockey drama ""Miracle"" transforms this potential melodrama into a hard-hitting family saga. The cast is superlative with Nick Nolte delivering a career-best performance as Paddy a man of violence humbled by age and late-blossoming wisdom. English actor Tom Hardy (""Inceptions"" sardonic identity forger) and Australias Joel Edgerton (""Animal Kingdom"") are formidable as bruised surly Tommy and Brendan a decent man backed into a corner by fate. Chuck Zlotnick Associated Press Tom Hardy left and and Joel Edgerton in ""Warrior."" The combat is the main draw for a film like this and it will rattle your teeth. But there is much more to ""Warrior"" which mixes bitter truths with transcendent uplift. It may be set in the arena of mixed martial arts combat but it is only incidentally concerned with breaking bones. Its really about healing.

More about Warrior >> A Keystone State saga - one brother teaches in Philly the other shows up out of nowhere at his pops door in Pittsburgh - Warrior like the sport of mixed martial arts it celebrates is anything but subtle. Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) has a wife a kid and a mortgage thats gone upside-down. A high school physics teacher he long ago promised the missus (Jennifer Morrison) that hed stop fighting. He was good very good but the blood and the bruises were too much. Now facing foreclosure on their home Brendan starts moonlighting mixing it up in strip-club parking lots for a few hundred dollars a win. At the other end of the Pennsylvania Turnpike Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) materializes at the Pittsburgh home where he and Brandon grew up. Mom has long since passed away and Dad (Nick Nolte) is on the wagon in AA nursing his coffees and regretting the years of drunken abuse he doled out to his family. Brendan wont have anything to do with him and now heres Tommy who had joined the Marines and then disappeared wanting his dad - Paddys his name - to whip him into shape for ""the Super Bowl of mixed martial arts"" - the War at the Shore an Atlantic City fightfest with a 5 million prize. Its the same event that Brendan unbeknownst to his estranged brother and father decides to make a run for enlisting a New Age-y trainer (Frank Grillo) to get him in fighting trim. ""Feel the Beethoven"" is this sports gurus motto - cue ""Ode to Joy"" and the training montages. And there you have Warriors twin trajectories Tommy the ex-Marine living with the demons of his experience in Iraq asking his father who trained him in high school (where he was a Junior Olympics wrestler) to put him through his regimen again and Brendan ""on the wrong side of 30"" trying to hold on to his house and his pride pumping weights sparring determined to make it to the final round. Guess where this is going. Steeped in recession-era blues - economic hard times the aftershocks of Iraq - Warrior takes its time getting to the Big Showdown in Atlantic City and the big revelation that brother is competing against brother. But Gavin OConnor the director (he did Pride and Glory a saga about a cop family) knows what hes doing. And the two leads Edgerton and Hardy pull off their respective roles - rising above the cliches and the melodrama - with ferocity and focus. (Its interesting that neither is American Edgertons from Australia and played one of the brothers in Animal Kingdom; Hardys a Brit and was in Inception.) As for Nolte the gravel-voiced veteran has a role overflowing with pathos. Paddy Conlon is a broken man a character full of trembling remorse and bad memories this close to falling off the wagon and crying in his beer. He needs to feel the Beethoven.

"Warrior movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Brothers brawls and baggage in Warrior -- 2 1/2 starsSeptember 08 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticTom Hardy and Joel Edgerton star in ""Warrior.""The feverish mixed martial arts infomercial ""Warrior"" opens up so many cans of emotional whup-ass that after a while you think Enough Its whupped Its whupped And yet the tears will flow by the gallon. Every time you start resisting somehow the film makes the sale again. Director and co-writer Gavin OConnor is a full-throated entertainer meaning he goes for the throat every second. Hes also an escape artist writing his characters into outlandishly cliched corners and then charging his way out against unbelievable odds. The acting elevates it even when the narrative doesnt. After a 14-year separation Iraq War veteran Tommy Conlon returns to the Pittsburgh home of his father Paddy who is nearly three years sober. Paddy did an awful lot of physical and psychic damage to his family before drying out however. Paddy did an awful lot of physical and psychic damage to his family before drying out however. In dribs and drabs ""Warrior"" leaks the details regarding how Paddys ex-wife and Tommy fled the toxic home while Paddy and Tommys older brother Brendan stayed behind and suffered. Tommys trust in his abandoning brother turned to ash; Brendan married his high school sweetheart played by Jennifer Morrison. Years later with kids and bills in his life Brendan teaches high school physics and brawls MMA-style for cash on the side. The banks due to foreclose on the house in 90 days. Solution Compete in the event called Sparta ""the Super Bowl of mixed martial arts"" in Atlantic City. That would be enough for a lot of films but ""Warrior"" is a lot of films in one film. Brendans estranged brother Tommy returns from combat with a major secret provoking all that rage and self-loathing. Though his brother doesnt know it Tommy too is after the 5 million MMA purse and has his sights set on one of the 16 middleweight slots. Does the final match come down to brother against brother? I wouldnt rule it out. Over-the-top performances wouldve destroyed ""Warrior"" by the second scene. But OConnor encourages a naturalistic low simmer even though his story beats are all about kettles boiling over (and over). Tom Hardy formidable in ""Bronson"" and soon to menace Batman in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" plays the combustible veteran Tommy. Hardy who is English isnt without his mannered edge but hes full of heat and unpredictable fire and responds well to the working-class Pittsburgh milieu. Australian-born Joel Edgerton brings a decency and likability to Brendan. The characters never seem like real brothers (theyre movie brothers through and through) but the actors commit. And its gratifying to see Nick Nolte do everything in his grumbly shambling power to make a fully dimensional character out of Paddy. OConnor scored a popular success with the Olympic-hockey rouser ""Miracle"" and then fared less well with the drunken-father/dueling sons police melodrama ""Pride and Glory."" ""Warrior"" lands somewhere in between in terms of quality. Despite (or because of) OConnors ham-fisted technique though theres no question the story lands its punches. And kicks. And body-slams. The way its filmed here mixed martial arts is made to look like a sport roughly on the finesse level of weed-whacking. But it all comes down to a memorably manipulative fight to the finish and a fight for pride and glory and a testament to miracles and the oldest heart-tugs in the movie book. Tommy we hear once ""ripped the door off a tank"" to save lives. ""Warrior"" goes about its escapist mission the same way. mjphillipstribune.com Warrior -- 2 1/2 stars MPAA rating PG-13 (for sequences of intense mixed martial arts fighting some language and thematic material) Cast Tom Hardy (Tommy Conlon); Joel Edgerton (Brendan Conlon); Jennifer Morrison (Tess Conlon); Frank Grillo (Frank Campana); Nick Nolte (Paddy Conlon) Credits Directed by Gavin OConnor; written by OConnor Anthony Tambakis and Cliff Dorfman; produced by Gavin OConnor and Greg OConnor.

Share Tweet The naturalistic camerawork gritty urban environments or brutal setting of mixed-martial-arts fighting may mislead viewers away from the truth Gavin OConnors Warrior is a man-weepie of the highest Hollywood order a would-be Rocky for an empire in decline. Its irresistible but how could people resist when Warrior comes packing double-barreled underdog arcs in the form of brothers played by Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton? Theyre estranged from each other but not as much as theyre estranged from their alcoholic father (Nick Nolte) who terrorized them and their mother until she ran away with her younger son prompting her husband to eventually get sober. Hardy is a distraught former Marine who washes up on his dads Pittsburgh doorstep and starts training at the local MMA gym beating the consciousness out of what turns out to be a highly ranked fighter in what was meant to be a casual sparring match. Edgerton is a Philly physics teacher and family man struggling to pay the bills a former UFC pro who moonlights in parking-lot matches for extra cash to throw an upside-down mortgage. These two archetypes of bruised American masculinity are played by a Brit and an Australian and played well--particularly in the case of Hardy whos been poised for stardom since 2009s Bronson. Hes riveting here a little boy lost with the hulking build of a minotaur; his dialogue would scarcely fill a few pages but his character speaks volumes with his fists. According to every rule of the movies these two are destined to grapple out their resentments in the cage and each ends up as an unlikely entrant in Sparta a nationally televised tournament arranged by a former finance hotshot who puts up a 5 million prize to determine ""the toughest man on the planet."" (That isnt the only slightly creaky classical reference--as a high-school wrestler young Tom wanted to beat the undefeated record of ancient Greek fighter Theogenes.) Warrior is unapologetic about the violence of MMA; Sparta takes up the second half of the generous runtime and its bouts are as vicious as they are exciting though theyd be better served by a camera that sat still long enough for them to develop. But for all its titular bravado Warrior never lets the audience forget the economic and spiritual desperation driving its two main characters who bleed for the screaming arena crowd in exchange for their shots at redemption and offer a rare glimpse of soul in a type of film that usually isnt obliged to provide one.

Brightly lit and enclosed by wire mesh it more resembles a giant chicken coop than a solemn battlefield. In the movies one expects something fearfully referred to as The Octagon to be a James Bond villain modeled after Buckminster Fuller. But in ""Warrior"" director Gavin OConnor has turned the octagon of Ultimate Fighting into a cage of boiling family emotion. Though the film might seem an inconsequential fight movie complete with tough guys and tattoos it turns genre fare into a surprisingly moving father-and-sons melodrama. Nick Nolte - back in his wheel house as an aging reformed drunk - plays Paddy Conlon the father of two sons both of whom are estranged from him. Years ago Paddy was a violent drunk whose abuse drove his wife and Tommy (Tom Hardy) to flee Westward. The older son Brendan (Joel Edgerton) hoping to remain close to his father stayed and married his teenage sweetheart (Jennifer Morrison). The brothers too separated for good. The younger and brawnier of the two Tommy appears suddenly on Paddys Pittsburgh stoop. A former Marine and high school wrestling star he proposes to reunite with his father so that he can be trained ""the old regimen"" as he becomes an MMA fighter. Tommy repeatedly makes clear that he wants his fathers help only in training ""This doesnt mean anything"" he says. Brendon has made out better in life than Tommy. He has two girls a suburban house in Philadelphia and teaches high school physics. But the bank is threatening to foreclose on their house and Brendans second income (fighting mixed martial arts in parking lot tournaments) has gotten him suspended from teaching. Set in working class Pennsylvania ""Warrior"" has plenty of contemporary resonance. The Conlon brothers have both been dealt an unfair lot Tommy an aimless Iraq war veteran Brendan squeezed out by an unfeeling bank. They each separately turn to mixed martial arts as their lone avenue of recourse and each gets into an ESPN-televised tournament in Atlantic City dubbed ""Sparta"" in which the prize is 5 million. The set-up is trite but OConnor (who wrote the script with Anthony Tambakis and Cliff Dorman) works hard to layer it in details. Much of the film feels calculated and overdone the grim industrial blight the hooded sweatshirts Paddy listening to ""Moby-Dick"" as an audio book. Similar to OConners last film ""Pride and Glory"" a police family drama the director gives epic self-serious treatment to a plot built on cliches. Both films though take familiar tropes (the corrupt cop story the sports underdog) and imbues them with family tragedy and haunting pasts. On the whole the 139-minute ""Warrior"" works better because of its outsized ambitions. The acting helps the films realism. Hardy (""Inception"" ""Bronson"") is boiling with rage a bull with his horns lowered for the entire movie. Edgerton (""Animal Kingdom"") is more composed but each carries a slight darkness. Their physicality (which is easily up the films rigors) comes across best in non-fighting scenes where they move gingerly like fighters. Nolte adds at least one weight class to ""Warrior"" playing the ultra-weary Paddy a broken man who accepts his sons ill-treatment because he knows he deserves it. Supporting work from Kevin Dunn (as a sympathetic principal) and Frank Grillo (as Brendans trainer) is also solid.

Warrior Trailer Tom Hardy Gets Punchy (Video) Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton recall the intensity of Bogart and Cagney but their bout collapses in the final round No punches are pulled in mixed martial arts fights -- theyre raw theyre violent and they look really painful which makes the sport as appropriate a metaphor as any for ""Warrior"" a tale of two MMA fighters thats really about the hard blows delivered by screwed-up family dynamics. As opposed to most movies about drunk dads and the damaged kids who survived them ""Warrior"" goes much heavier on the regret and recrimination than it does on the forgiveness and the closure. Also see Warrior Trailer Tom Hardy Gets Punchy (Video) Dont be surprised to find yourself flinching more at the family arguments than at the wham-bam head-smashing. Nick Nolte digging fearlessly into his own personal demons plays Paddy Conlon a boozy veteran who spent much of his fatherhood years training his son Tommy to be a world-class fighter. When Mrs. Conlon got fed up with Paddys abuse she left with Tommy but her older son Brendan stuck around wanting to stay close to his girlfriend and incorrectly assuming that Paddy would finally start paying attention to him. Thats the backstory in play when grown-up Tommy (Tom Hardy) returns from combat in Iraq. At first he wants absolutely nothing to do with Paddy but when Tommy climbs into the ring and flattens one of the top national MMA contenders he hires Paddy to be his trainer -- and nothing more. Meanwhile Brendan (Joel Edgerton) has put his own pugilistic past behind him and now hes a physics teacher whos married to his high-school sweetheart (Jennifer Morrison) and the father of two young daughters. But when the bank comes calling and threatens to take away his house he finds himself climbing back into the ring fighting in strip-joint parking lots for a few bucks. Read also In Warrior Does Lionsgate Know it has a Rocky? When a billionaire decides to hold a winner-take-all MMA tournament in Atlantic City with a 5 million purse both brothers decide they want to go for it. (Tommy wants to give the money to the widow of his war buddy.) The brothers unite at the Jersey shore but Tommy still resents Brendan for not coming with him to take care of their mother and Brendan still resents Paddy for his past bad behavior which all the 1000-day-sober AA chips in the world wont heal. (""The only thing [Brendan and I] have in common"" Tommy tells Paddy ""is that we have no use for you."") Director Gavin OConnor has established himself as a skillful crafter of both uplifting sports movies (""Miracle"") and stories of complicated family dynamics (""Tumbleweeds"") and he gets to flex both muscles here. I cant attest to the realism of the fight sequences but cinematically theyre stirring and taut and empathetic and everything else that theyre supposed to be. And while OConnor and co-screenwriters Anthony Tambakis and Cliff Dorfman arent above tugging our heartstrings with character reversals -- Brendans wife tells him she refuses to go watch him fight so you just know shes eventually going to turn up ringside in Atlantic City -- they wisely avoid any easy resolutions for Paddy particularly after he falls off the wagon. The script often hearkens back to old-school fight pictures (theres everything but the violin-playing boxer with the sister who needs an operation) and the cast comes through in a very classic-Hollywood way. Its not too much of a stretch to say that Hardy has the intensity (and the willingness to be disliked by the audience) of vintage Humphrey Bogart while Edgerton has the twinkly-eyed mug and just-under-the-surface violence of young James Cagney. And in the tradition of those Warner Bros. contract players who stole every scene from the stars Nolte acts the living hell out of his role; his Paddy is pitiable and haunted by regret but you cant take your eyes off him. Where ""Warrior"" falls apart is in the big climax where the two brothers climb into the ring to fight each other. Because the movie had made me sympathize with both of them I found myself not really caring who won since I was rooting for both and against neither. On top of that the fight itself is supposed to provide some sort of emotional breakthrough for the brothers relationship that just doesnt play -- if walloping the crap out of each other provides a catharsis that conversation doesnt the movie never clearly communicates why their fight changes things. (It obviously worked for a lot of men at the screening I attended who were trying not to be caught crying as the lights came up so you may feel differently about it.) All in all though ""Warrior"" wins on points even with a resolution that didnt work for me. I wouldnt be surprised if it winds up having the same effect on New Recession audiences that ""Rocky"" had with victims of 70s malaise. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Warrior Good Director Gavin OConnor. Cast Tom Hardy Nick Nolte Joel Edgerton. Rating PG-13 for intense mixed-martial-arts fighting language thematic material. This weeks new movie releases Do it anyway. Implausible and far too reliant on coincidence with a mixed-martial-arts tournament the setting for the climax (almost the entire second half of the movie) director and co-writer Gavin OConnors movie is nevertheless gripping and emotionally satisfying. Outstanding performances by Tom Hardy Nick Nolte and Joel Edgerton are a big part of the reason. Hardy is as good an actor as there is working today; his intensity here is amazing. Nolte hasnt been this good in a long time. And Edgerton holds his own with both. Interview Tom Hardy on Warrior Interview Nick Nolte a Warrior in new film Paddy Conlon (Nolte) is a recovering alcoholic who drives to his Pittsburgh home one cold night and sees his son Tommy (Hardy) sitting on the stoop. Its a shock - Tommy and Paddys former wife after years of abuse had left town long ago; Paddy hasnt seen Tommy in 14 years. In the interim Tommy has served like his old man did in the Marines. Much more he wont say. With good reason it turns out. Tommy is seething with resentment and anger and Paddy is powerless to do anything but apologize for his past behavior. You were more interesting when you were drunk Tommy tells his father and you think that maybe Paddy believes it. A legendary high-school wrestler trained by Paddy Tommy begins sparring in a local gym. A video of him destroying a top MMA contender goes viral on YouTube. Soon Tommy sets his sights on Sparta an MMA tournament in Atlantic City with a 5 million payout to the winner and he wants his father to help him. Eager to spend any time with his son Paddy agrees. Meanwhile Brendan (Edgerton) Paddys other son teaches high school in a nearby suburb. Brendan also has little to do with Paddy and has enough problems of his own to occupy him. He and his wife Tess (an underused Jennifer Morrison) struggle to make their mortgage payments and are in danger of losing their home. To make ends meet Brendan fights in cheesy pseudo-MMA bouts held in the parking lots of strip clubs; one such fight gets him suspended from his teaching job. Desperate for money Brendan against his wifes wishes wrangles his way into the Sparta competition as well. Where this leads you might well guess. It doesnt really matter. Nor does OConnors giving over nearly half of the movie to the competition - he shoots it so well and makes the fights so savagely compelling that the somewhat predictable nature of the story is easily overlooked. Tommy and Brendan are opposites in the octagon where the fights take place. Tommy is almost comically straightforward a brute who simply pummels his opponents into submission in short order. Brendan absorbs punishment like a masochistic sponge waiting for the other fighter to tire to slip up willing to take abuse if it means achieving his goal. Yes their tactics reflect much about their lives. The real objective here of course isnt just winning the competition but healing old psychic wounds even as physical ones are opened. These are painful injuries by any standard; neither type is for the squeamish. Hardy Nolte and Edgerton see to that in unflinching raw performances. Thanks to them ""Warrior"" moves beyond its somewhat trite trappings. Its a surprisingly moving film. While the fight scenes are unquestionably thrilling the movies best bits are not about winning and losing but about pain and ultimately forgiveness.

(Chuck Zlotnick) It seems that all you need to land in a movie these days is a gym membership that twists and tortures a normal physique into that of Conan the Barbarian with six-pack abs a 28-inch waist and obliques the size of hubcaps. The result is usually a load of two-fisted junk; an exciting well-made testosterone explosion called Warrior is a rare exception. Director Gavin OConnor knows his way around a sports arena and Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton are two meatheads who can really act. Playing two brothers who compete against each other for the same purse in a high-stakes mixed martial arts tournament in Atlantic City after being estranged for 14 years they lend charisma and balance to the far-fetched plot of an otherwise predictable fight movie with such authority and yes sensitivity that they prove irresistible even to an audience familiar with this kind of stuff. Mr. Hardy who made an impression in the otherwise incomprehensible Inception plays Tommy Conlon the younger brother a former wrestling prodigy who returns to Pennsylvania from Iraq in unstable condition--an angry hard-drinking Marine who inherited his violence from the reprobate father (Nick Nolte putting the ravaged remnants of his once-handsome face to good use) who used to be his trainer before his alcoholism wrecked his family and drove his two sons apart. Joel Edgerton the Australian hunk who got rave reviews from New York theater critics playing Stanley Kowalski opposite Cate Blanchett in last years acclaimed production of A Streetcar Named Desire is Brendan Reardon the older brother who took his mothers surname. Hes now a retired boxer-turned-respectable Philadelphia schoolteacher with a wife and two kids a daughter struggling with a heart defect a mortgage default a school board that suspends him without pay for going back into the ring and endless money problems. Tommys unstoppable demons (he went AWOL after friendly fire that killed his best friend) and Brendans need to save his family from financial disaster lead the brothers to compete in the Sparta tournament the Super Bowl of winner-take-all fights with a five-million-dollar jackpot. Their opponents include Olympic gold medalists and undefeated champions throughout the world so the odds against them are overwhelming but there can only be one winner and the outcome is no surprise. Between the brawn and the broken bones the film builds character among the brothers who need reconciliation the father who seeks redemption and a shattered family legacy that craves strength through bonding. This territory has been traveled before in everything from Champion and The Set-Up to Rocky and The Cinderella Man but in Gavin OConnors direction and pungent screenplay the melodramatics are integral the pace and timing never slow and the big fight action in the cage contains some of the best staged combat sequences Ive ever seen. The final bloody showdown between brothers is so relentless it seems to be happening in real time and the circling camera is as much a part of the last round as a mouth guard or a rabbit punch. I was impressed by the technical proficiency but I also found some of the show-business choices worth noting Tommy swaggers aggressively through the mob to massive chants and cheers by a Marine choir while Brendan enters the ring to Beethovens Ninth Symphony. Rarely have two actors endured so much savage punishment on-screen and they still manage to become real and three-dimensional people who are more than just punching bags. Skillfully made and adrenalin-fueled Warrior is nothing like what I expected. It overcomes inescapable boxing and martial arts cliches and leaves you thoroughly sated energized and wanting more. rreedobserver.com WARRIOR Running Time 139 minutes Written by Gavin OConnor Anthony Tambakis and Cliff Dorfman Directed by Gavin OConnor Starring Tom Hardy Nick Nolte and Joel Edgerton 3/4 Comment Filed under Joel Edgerton Military Hero Mixed Martial Arts movie movie reviews Nick Nolte Tom Hardy Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Pussy Riot On Their Provocative Donald Trump-Inspired Art Installation Culture The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP,http://www.observer.com/2011/09/warrior-is-not-without-a-fight/,200,warrior31,warrior,observer

Wednesday September 7 2011 at 4 a.m. By Nick Pinkerton 1 A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - You know those Affliction shirts covered in skulls gothic lettering and tribal patterns all cacophonous symbols of badass machismo? Thats what the Mixed Martial Arts tie-in movie Warrior is--an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink fire sale of male-weepie tropes awesome in its thoroughness. The collective dream of authentic blue-collar American grubbiness lives on in a Pittsburgh row house where long-estranged son Tommy (Tom Hardy) just back from a tour with the marines visits his recovering alcoholic dad Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte). Tommy cant forgive the old man for breaking up the family but needs a trainer for his nascent MMA career. In Philadelphia Tommys older brother Brendon (Joel Edgerton) a physics teacher and family man who has likewise broken ties with his past gets back in the fighters octagon to keep the bank from repossessing his house. The announcement of a tournament-style championship contest sets the brothers on a collision course to a family reunion in the cage. Old line-gargler Nolte remains an effortlessly moving presence while Hardy and Edgerton embody their archetypes and handle the physical demands. With a silverback strut and the neck of a 30s-mural prole Hardy does Method brooding while Edgerton underplays with integrity in a film that spends its last hour piling climax on top of climax holding the audience in an emotional arm bar.

Hes also a former mixed-martial-arts champion and so -- strictly for the money -- he decides to get back in the ring even if the clawing kicking anything-goes bouts threaten to kill him. Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) an Iraq-war veteran who left the battlefield under mysterious circumstances is also an MMA fighter and he too wants back in the ring. The two men are brothers and were once close. But the only thing that unites them now apart from their ruthless hand-to-hand prowess is how much they hate their father Paddy (Nick Nolte) a recovering alcoholic whose drinking tore the family apart. Warrior a two-track drama of fighting and redemption tells the parallel stories of Brendan and Tommy and the movie with its grim deliberate rhythms and grainy 70s-style look comes on as if it were no mere sports fable. Its about demon-haunted Irish Catholic men testing and punishing themselves. Its about broken families coming together. Its about economic desperation and about America getting off the ropes and recovering its fighting spirit. If Rocky was sweet and inspiring and The Fighter was touching and fascinating Warrior is at times almost gravely self-important. The gifted director Gavin OConnor (Miracle) brings the film an affecting ripped-from-the-guts spirit even if he cant really hide how many old-movie tropes are floating around in it. Mostly Warrior is a showcase for its up-and-coming stars. Edgerton from last years Animal Kingdom and Hardy who stole scenes as the identity forger in Inception both have a tense tough presence though in a slightly colorless way. You buy them as brothers and as gnarly brawlers hungry to win but Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale they are not. In this film theyre closer to the second coming of Tom Berenger and Michael Pare.

"Warrior | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; warrior ) Warrior (United States 2011) September 01 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli I dont know much about Mixed Martial Arts except that it appears to be an extreme form of regulated fighting with combatants using a variety of tactics to bring their opponent to heel. In Warrior Gavin OConnors surprisingly elegiac drama about a quest for a MMA title familiarity with the sport is unnecessary because ultimately this movie is more about the dark bloody conflicts within the human heart than it is about what transpires in the cage. Most sports films (and fight films in particular) are to one degree or another about winning. Warrior illustrates that there can be loss in a win and victory in a defeat. Its not what happens during the final bout that defines Connors picture but what occurs immediately afterwards. It would be disingenuous to argue that Warrior doesnt try to stimulate testosterone but OConnor doesnt overplay his hand. The annoying tendency of an overreliance upon handheld shots aside Warriors production values are high and theres plenty of MMA action to keep fans engaged and to inject an element of action into the proceedings. Still Warrior is closer kin to Raging Bull Million Dollar Baby and The Fighter than to Rocky and its ilk. The three central characters all badly broken leave a deeper impression than the arena in which their redemptive quests play out. The narrative focuses on three men estranged brothers Tom and Brendan Conlon (Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton) and their father Paddy (Nick Nolte). Tom a taciturn marine has come home to Pittsburgh to train for a spot in ""Sparta"" a winner-takes-all MMA tournament to be held in Atlantic City (the ""Superbowl of MMA""). He is willing to put aside (if not forgive) his fathers coldness and abandonment in return for the Old Mans help in training. Paddy a recovering alcoholic with 1000 days of sobriety on his calendar leaps at the opportunity to re-connect with his son even though Tom makes is clear that their relationship will be purely one of trainer and fighter. Meanwhile across the state in Philadelphia former UFC fighter and current high school teacher Brendan finds himself in need of cash in order to save his home from foreclosure. Against the wishes of his wife Tess (Jennifer Morrison) he becomes involved in low-level MMA contests. The school board suspends him when they discover hes moonlighting in a cage and he begins to pursue entrance into Sparta by using a past connection to trainer Frank Campana (Frank Grillo) who is well-respected within the sport. One would have to be hopelessly naA-ve not to recognize that this is all going to come down to a match between Tom and Brendan with a torn Paddy on the sidelines. That dynamic in and of itself is interesting. Most sports/fight movies establish a clear ""good guy/bad guy"" situation and let them pummel each other until the inevitable occurs. Movies like Rocky in which the hero loses rarely happen. In Warrior however we are presented with the dilemma of two well-rounded characters squaring off against one another. And the question of who gets the 5 million dollar purse is secondary to how they handle the situation. This battle is as much about redemption reconciliation and putting demons to rest. OConnor does not dispense with sports movie clichA(c)s but he elevates them. Warrior is bolstered by four strong performances two of which are standouts. Tom Hardy who redefined his career with his screen-searing work in Bronson is tremendous radiating chained anger and barely controlled bile in every scene. Yet as Toms backstory unfolds we see the deeply rooted pain that lies at the core of it all. The word ""volcanic"" was often used to describe Hardys work in Bronson; it applies here as well. Nick Nolte who has received his share of accolades over a long and prosperous career provides a noteworthy turn as a world-weary father who is desperate to re-connect with the sons he abused and neglected. Its a storyline many (perhaps too many) fathers will relate to and Nolte is note-perfect in essaying Paddy. The portrayals of Joel Edgerton (a character actor with a fair number of TV credits) and Jennifer Morrison (best known for her supporting role in House) have less flashy but no less important roles. OConnor gives the film a dark moody look which is the best choice for so many roiling emotions. This is not a traditional stand-up-and-cheer fight movie; the undercurrents are too strong and deep. If theres a negative to the filmmakers style its that in an attempt to promote intimacy and immediacy he overuses the hand-held camera. While this might be fine for the fight scenes it spills over into many of the ""everyday"" moments and the shaking is at times disorienting (and may result in nausea for sensitive viewers). Warrior will undoubtedly be compared in many quarters to The Fighter but this is in some ways a more powerful and disturbing motion picture. It offers a catharsis but theres something bittersweet about the way in which Warrior concludes. And unlike the recent Oscar nominee this one is not constrained by the ""based on a true story"" label. MMA may be a comparatively new form of fighting but Warrior demonstrates that its as fertile a field for drama as older and more venerable sports.

Daily Edition Login to download Warrior Film Review 500 PM PDT 8/9/2011 by Kirk Honeycutt FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Lionsgate A emotionally raw family drama well disguised as a brutal fight film. TWITTER Director Gavin OConnors emotionally raw family drama stars Joel Edgerton Tom Hardy and Nick Nolte. With a fractured nuclear family that Eugene ONeill would embrace and electrifying fight scenes in the not-quite-mainstream sport of mixed martial arts Gavin OConnors Warrior makes for a sturdy visceral entertainment. Its a long movie that feels short It grabs you in early scenes intense though low-key before all hell breaks loose then keeps you riveted to its mostly male characters -- a father two sons a trainer and yes a wife who gets left out of key decisions -- as members of a blue-collar family head for a winner-takes-all tournament in Atlantic City. Each role is a meaty one for the movies highly watchable actors while OConnors crew especially cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi and no less than four editors has carefully constructed an atmosphere in which the implausible might flourish. Superior to last year lionized The Fighter Warrior may go several rounds starting in early September. Lionsgate needs to put some muscle into its marketing campaign though and word of mouth will have to energize the fight films male demographic. OConnor who previously helmed the sports movie Miracle about the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team and Pride and Glory a multi-generational police family saga more or less combines these themes within two sets of highly contrasted worlds. There is the darkly shot working-class neighborhoods of Pittsburgh where a despised pater familias Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte) sober for nearly 1000 days following a lifetime of drunken abuse hangs out and the sunny suburbs where his high school teacher-son Brendan (Joel Edgerton) lives with his wife Tess (Jennifer Morrison) and two youngsters. A further contrast comes from that citys sweaty dirty gyms and a temporary tent in a strip joint parking lot where local punks beat each other into raw meat versus a ""World Series"" of mixed martial arts staged within the neon glitz of Atlantic City. The movie begins in Pittsburgh where a wary ceasefire between Paddy and his sons family with everyone refusing to acknowledge the others existence gets disrupted by the abrupt re-appearance of Brendans brother Tommy (Tom Hardy). He is a ghost from the dead as no one has seen him in 14 years. A back story gradually materializes Neither brother could stand their dad but Tommy chose to head west with their mother where she died a painful death from cancer while Brendan opted to stay in Pittsburgh to be near his sweetheart whom he eventually married. Tommy resents his brothers ""betrayal"" almost as much as he does his fathers abuse but oddly its his father he chooses to look up Once a talented amateur wrestler trained by his dad Tommy wants the old man to train him once again so he can enter the mixed martial-arts event. In a coincidence of which the film abounds Brendan also wants to enter that contest as his house is headed for foreclosure and he sees no other option. So the brothers are on a collision course and the film blithely assumes one can willy-nilly enter this contest despite having no recent experience. A video showing Tommy taking apart a champion while sparing gets posted on the Internet which partially explains why Tommy is able to enter the tournament. This is the same video that leads to the revelation of Tommys heroic rescue of fellow Marines while stationed in Iraq which makes this dark-horse combatant a popular favorite. OConnor and fellow writers Anthony Tambakis and Cliff Dorfman concentrate on their characters giving you enough information but leaving plenty of room for these most capable actors to fill in the idiosyncratic derails. Surly and brooding about wrongs real and imagined Hardys thickly muscled highly tattooed ex-soldier is a ticking bomb. Emotionally he is in a permanent fighters crouch in constant vigilance for the next punch fate will throw his way while looking to do damage to any and all foes. Edgerton is a more nuanced character. Backed into a corner financially he has no choice or at least thinks he doesnt but to fight. His childhood has taught him the need of a strong family so he pores his affection and devotion into his own. Yet shades of his dad his decision to re-enter the ring is a selfish one that he shares with his wife only after hes made it. Like many ex-alkies Noltes Paddy wraps himself in blandness as a kind of disguise. Hes hiding from his former self even to the point that Tommy says more than once he prefers the drunk to this dull and weak person. The ""normal"" characters in the screenplay help to balance the three Old Testament types. This would include Frank Grillo who plays Brendans trainer dubious about his client but too much of a friend to say no and Morrison as the wife whom the script shortchanges. The voice of reason is too muted here. For the footage of extended fights over a two-day tournament whether shooting from the rafters or up close in the feral ring itself Takayanagis cameras dart and weave just like fighters. Sometimes they may even miss a punch and instead come to rest on an anxious corner man or a screaming face in the crowd. The excitement of these matches is brilliantly captured almost horrifyingly so. Did a chiropractor invent this sport? Being slammed on your back or neck repeatedly is a tough way to earn a buck -- or even five million. For an ""entertainment"" Warrior accomplishes a lot. The family drama resonates strongly with a resolution that in retrospect seems like the only way the brothers could have rediscovered blood ties. Meanwhile their fights are downright compelling. Instead of interrupting the drama the story continues in the ring as the two fighters drag a lifetime of emotional torment in with them. Theyre fighting their demons as much as their opponents. Warrioris one of the few fight films in which winning or losing is notthe key factor.

An improbably effective and affecting mix of raw emotions and exciting smackdowns ""Warrior"" shapes up as a pic with the potential to appeal to critics and audiences alike. Lionsgate faces the formidable challenge of convincing potential ticketbuyers that theres as much heart and soul as blood and thunder in this sharply observed drama involving long-estranged brothers destined to compete in a high-stakes winner-take-all mixed martial arts tournament. But savvy marketing -- along with upbeat reviews and word-of-mouth raves -- could push the pic toward scoring a four-quadrant knockout. Working from a script he co-wrote with Anthony Tambakis and Cliff Dorfman helmer Gavin OConnor (who dealt with the slightly less violent sport of hockey in 2004s ""Miracle"") spends much of the first hour methodically revealing backstories and defining current circumstances for the three lead characters interrupting the drama every so often for a scene in which a character kicks punches or otherwise pummels someone else in a MMA-style match-up. During the early going however theres appreciably more attention paid to action outside the ring. An Iraq War veteran Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) returns home to Philadelphia after a 14-year absence and pays a surprise visit to his dad Paddy (Nick Nolte) a recovering alcoholic whos anxiously approaching his thousandth day of sobriety. Its not exactly a warm reunion Tommy wielding scorn and sarcasm like blunt instruments all too vividly recalls having to go on the run with his now-deceased mom years earlier to escape Paddys booze-fueled brutality. But even back in the bad old days Paddy was an adept wrestling coach and Tommy benefited from his tutelage. Now the prodigal son wants his father to help him prepare for Sparta an MMA event with a 5 million purse. Paddy deeply ashamed of past sins and desperate to reconnect with Tommy agrees to be his sons trainer stoically accepting Tommys repeated recriminations and humiliations as a kind of penance. Even as father and son get ready to rumble however Tommys older brother Brendan (Joel Edgerton) begins his own journey to Sparta. Brendan who put aside many of his dreams when Tommy and their mom departed also seeks aid from a former mentor -- an MMA trainer (Frank Grillo) who uses Beethovens Ninth Symphony as an unlikely practice tool -- after the discovery that hes been participating in underground bouts gets him suspended from his high-school teaching job. OConnor adroitly sustains an air of kitchen-sink realism throughout the first half of ""Warrior"" precisely and persuasively describing the socioeconomic specifics of his characters day-to-day lives. More importantly OConnor elicits such powerful performances from his three leads -- and gets such first-rate work from supporting players Grillo and Jennifer Morrison playing Brendans childhood sweetheart -- that he keeps the drama grippingly focused despite the fuzziness of a few plot details. Occasionally recalling the bruised and brooding virility of a young Marlon Brando Hardy is arrestingly intense as Tommy by turns implosive and explosive as he alternates between guilt and rage savagery and self-loathing. In perfect counterpoint Edgerton winningly portrays Brendan as a sensitive and passionate man who must dredge up inner furies -- and feed on mounting desperation -- to emerge victorious in his MMA battles. To their considerable credit OConnor and his co-scripters generate virtually equal sympathy for each brother coming up with an emotionally and dramatically satisfying payoff for their climactic cage match. Noltes heartfelt and fearless performance as the anguished Paddy -- a man whose self-abnegation is such that he no longer feels entitled to express anger -- ranks with the veteran actors finest work. Still some auds may feel frustrated by the pics evasiveness after planting strong hints (most notably Paddys obsessive interest in ""Moby Dick"") that the character may be haunted by even worse sins in his past. Most of the second half of ""Warrior"" is devoted to the Sparta tournament in an aggressively gaudy Atlantic City as the mano-a-mano mayhem threatens to overshadow the dramatic interactions between the bouts. (Just how extreme are these battles? According to the credits even the stunt doubles required a double.) Lenser Masanobu Takayanagi joins forces with editors John Gilroy Sean Albertson Matt Chesse and Aaron Marshall to make the fight scenes -- skillfully choreographed by JJ ""Loco"" Perry -- more than believable enough to make viewers wince or cheer exactly when theyre supposed to. But the production values are every bit as impressive during the deliberately drab and dreary scenes in Philadelphia. Thats where ""Warrior"" patiently lays the groundwork for its consistently compelling narrative preparing auds for an ending that just might move some strong men to tears.
