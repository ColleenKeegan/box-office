The game of perceived reactions is just beginning but it must be clear by now that my sympathies are entirely with Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant in their impending box-office laser-gun duel with the Jedi knights and their juvenile video-game accomplices and accessories. For one thing Ms. Roberts and Mr. Grant are incontestably flesh-and-blood presences sprinkled with enough stardust to outshine any constellation of digital fabrications in Mr. Lucas galaxy. For another Notting Hill is not burdened with the curse of excessive expectations that afflicts the Lucas extravaganza through all its early pans in the print media. Indeed Notting Hill seems to have come out of nowhere to revitalize two stellar careers that seemed vulnerable not too long ago in this decades cutthroat atmosphere in which a slight stumble or minor reversal can cause the most celebrated Jacks and Jills to tumble down the hill to virtual oblivion. The knives have been out for Ms. Roberts ever since she walked out on a wedding date with Kiefer Sutherland and for Mr. Grant after he was caught in a compromising position by the indefatigable Los Angeles Police Department. Still Mr. Grant never had as far to fall as Ms. Roberts. He was merely a celebrity but she was a supercelebrity. After coming up slowly but noticeably in Mystic Pizza (1988) and Steel Magnolias (1989) Ms. Roberts hit the critical and commercial jackpot with Pretty Woman (1990) largely through the volcanic pleasure she expressed with her seismic smile. She was at her peak but though she scored a fair number of hits thereafter the media buzz seemed to zero in on her alleged shortcomings and setbacks. Flatliners (1990) and Sleeping With the Enemy (1991) did well enough at the box office but her performances were not considered to have extended her range. Nor did the highly popular Pelican Brief (1993) count in her favor. Then came a string of out-and-out commercial flops with I Love Trouble (1994) in which she and Nick Nolte were compared unfavorably with Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy; Something to Talk About (1995) an ultra-feminist fable in which Kyra Sedgwick got the best notices for beating up on men with more ferocity than Ms. Roberts; Michael Collins (1996) in which she was not considered Irish enough to share the blarney with the dominant male characters played by Liam Neeson Aidan Quinn and Alan Rickman; and the seemingly catastrophic Mary Reilly (1996) in which she played wildly against type as the glumly subdued maid of John Malkovichs remarkably minimalist Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. In trying to broaden her range Ms. Roberts was in clear danger of having her price lowered. Fortunately she bounced back in 1997 with My Best Friends Wedding  and the mutterings over her box-office decline subsided somewhat. Ms. Roberts suffered the ultimate indignity when the cackling hens of the junk media had the temerity to criticize her marriage to Lyle Lovett because he was not good-looking enough to be married to a movie star. Now single again Ms. Roberts should have less of this sniping at her new companion Benjamin Bratt with whom she recently appeared in the crime TV series Law amp; Order  to sky-high ratings thus spreading her stardom to a second medium. Mr. Grant reached his peak of popular acceptance as a sexily shy dreamboat in Mike Newells Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994) the product of the same screenwriter and producing team as was involved in Notting Hill  and consequently endowed with much of the same sly charm and humor. But the story structure is much simpler and less multilayered than it was in Four Weddings . Mr. Grants character benefited in Weddings from the dislike the otherwise attractive Andie MacDowell aroused in the audience with her proud enumeration of her many affairs a dislike intensified by the poignant presence in the background of the rejected Kristin Scott Thomas character. Still despite his many good performances Mr. Grant has remained in the shadows for the past five years his image of appealing sexual reticence clouded by his Los Angeles misadventure. Hence much of the magic of the Roberts-Grant pairing arises from what the late great French critic Andre Bazin designated as ""doubling"" that is the reinforcement of the screen illusion with a corresponding reality in the life of the actor. Ergo as Anna Scott Hollywood superstar Ms. Roberts does not have to grope for her motivation. She has faced down the media hordes in real life and she has not only survived she has triumphed. Similarly as William Thacker the underachieving owner of a seedy travel-book shop in Londons Notting Hill Mr. Grant does not have to fake the feelings of obscurity inadequacy and embarrassment his character is called upon to express. He has stumbled spectacularly in his time. Notting Hill has been likened not inaptly to Roman Holiday  but with several crucial switches in the status and character of the two couples. In some respects Anna Scott is both the movie queen and the aggressive American whereas William Thacker is both the sleeping prince and the quietly worshipful nobody with no mercenary objectives in his restrained pursuit. There are no other major characters in the mix no insurmountable obstacles to the relationship except its sheer improbability in real life. What Mr. Michell Mr. Curtis and their collaborators have achieved is the very difficult task of making Anna Scott just emotionally needy enough and William Thacker just barely imaginative enough to hurdle the imposing barriers between them. There is also a democratic spirit in reverse that enables the rich famous Yank to hobnob with the humble but winningly witty and charismatic Brit. Thackers comically unprepossessing family and friends provide most of the gentle humor as they confront the storybook romance in their midst. The ending is happy and ironic in equal measure but most of the fun is just getting there with the right chemistry and compatibility. Weve Waited So Long for So Little As for The Phantom Menace  if Winston Churchill had spent any time on line to see the mouse that has emerged from the Lucas mountain he might have remarked that never before in the annals of filmic frenzy have so many waited so long for so little. But dont take my word for it. Just read all my shameless colleagues who have gleefully jumped the gun on the release date with witheringly scornful blasts at the films hollow pretentiousness. Indeed at the rate things are leaking I may be one of the last print journalists to review the movie. Yet I can hardly pretend to be disappointed inasmuch as I was one of the few reviewers who panned the original Star Wars after its first press screening in 1977 at a time when Mr. Lucas eventual global blockbuster was in the process of being dumped by its skeptical studio chieftains. While I was enduring this first exposure of Star Wars  I mistakenly assumed that the audience was laughing at it rather than with it. I found it silly juvenile and grandiose all at the same time. Much to my surprise even my hard-nosed editors at The Village Voice were shocked that I wasnt going along with the flow in hailing the kinetic energy and alleged make-believe magnificence of this fable for children of all ages. As far as I was concerned the Force was a farce and I still feel this way even though its high priests are played by excellent actors like Alec Guinness in the original and Liam Neeson in the current prequel. What I hadnt expected when I recently attended an invitational screening was that the action would be so tedious on even the popcorn level-that is unless you groove on endless laser-beam duels that reminded me of nothing so much as Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone thrusting and parrying their way through The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938). Mr. Lucas and his associates have made references to many screen spectacles of the past in their very busy digitalized mise en scene . But the people in the foreground seem to be limited to the vocabulary of characters in old jungle movies. As the young Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi the character played by Alec Guinness in the original Star Wars  the gifted Scottish actor Ewan McGregor is reduced to reading lines that could have been rendered by Sabu in his own time. Aside from Mr. Neesons skillfully measured personification of the Jedi knight known as Qui-Gon the only other bright gleam of human talent comes from veteran Ingmar Bergman actress Pernilla August as Shmi Skywalker the sadly unselfish mother of little Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) the father of Luke Skywalker. Also appearing in their earliest incarnations are the cutesy droids R2-D2 and C-3PO. Im sorry I cant pretend to be thrilled to be reunited with these old friends. Even Jedi Master Yoda doesnt fill me with goose pimples of nostalgia. Indeed I find Phantom Menace terminally uninteresting not because it is some kind of extravagant folly but because it seems strangely remote from the premillennial jitters. Mr. Lucas is not without a certain technocratic sagacity but I dont think hes communicating even with the young as astutely as he once did. I sense a kind of becalmed genius consumed by his technology and reduced to artistic lethargy as befits a willing prisoner of his own myth.

Its slick its gawky its 10 minutes too long and its certainly not ""Four Weddings and a Funeral Part 2"" in either construction or overall tone. But ""Notting Hill"" the second outing of scripter Richard Curtis producer Duncan Kenworthy and actor Hugh Grant has buckets to spare of that rarest screen commodity -- genuine engaging charm -- plus a cast and production values that fully deliver when the chips are down. Toplined in style by Grant and Julia Roberts this romantic comedy couched as a modern fairytale about a shy London bookseller who falls for a Hollywood megastar (and vice versa) has all the makings of a spiffy popular hit for Polygram and Universal so long as auds dont go expecting a retread of the previous picture. Following heavy local hoopla the film world-preemed in London April 27 and starts exclusive engagements May 21 going wide the following week. Stateside Universal is planning nationwide sneaks for May 15 with general release to follow May 28. Clearly aware of the sophomore curse and the fact that the 1994 ""Four Weddings"" was both very much of its time and unreplicable in sequel terms Kenworthy and Curtis have preserved elements of the first pic (glamorous Yank gauche Brit hero a circle of his friends) but gone for a much more straight-arrow storyline less ensemble playing and a good old-fashioned princess-and-a-commoner love story thats like a late-90s London-set version of ""Roman Holiday."" Though theres still plenty of Curtis signature humor especially in his comic observation of the spaces between words this is very much a kinder gentler movie -- less manic in keeping its audience hooked more confident in the longer lines of the storys emotional arc and less reliant on barbed one-liners and eccentric characters per se. Roberts American is a fully-drawn character rather than a one-dimensional bolt-on like Andie MacDowells. Notable too is the fact that apart from its two leads the cast is hardly packed with significant names. In all those respects pic says a lot about the greater self-assurance in the Brit film industry since the time of ""Four Weddings"" when the movie stood out with its confidence and optimism. Grants William Thacker is a bookseller in Notting Hill and his circle in the north London district includes a mad unwashed Welshman Spike (Rhys Ifans from ""Twin Town"") with whom he shares a house; Martin (James Dreyfus) his assistant at the tiny travel book shop on Portobello Road; younger sister Honey (Emma Chambers) a complete ditz; best friends couple Max and Bella (Tim McInnerny Gina McKee); and Bernie (Hugh Bonneville) whos a boring something in the City. Williams unspectacular life changes one day when Anna Scott (Roberts) the planets most famous film actress walks in alone and buys a book. Shes friendly in a professional way hes star-struck and there it might have ended if William hadnt subsequently gone out to buy some orange juice and bumped into Anna on the street spilling the drink over her expensive T-shirt. After some persuasion Anna agrees to go to Williams nearby house for a sponge-down relaxes under his awkward but honest charm and again seems to walk out of his life. Seconds later however while William is still recovering from the experience  she returns -- to collect her shopping bag and give him an unexpected kiss of thanks just before the nerdy Spike enters and brings them crashing back to reality. Its a tribute to Curtis dialogue and helmer Roger Michells skill with actors that this setup works in screen terms. Both Grant and Roberts manage to shed enough of their movie personas to establish the beginnings of a screen chemistry that becomes vital as the film progresses. Thereon the films focus widens as William turns up at a hotel to meet Anna for tea only to find shes in the middle of a press junket; invites her to a birthday dinner for Honey at the home of Max and Bella (a splendidly played sequence); and spends the next evening alone with her at dinner. However in the first of several setbacks to their cross-tracks romance a surprise awaits them back at her hotel -- and Anna disappears again from Williams life. Only after two more coincidental meetings spread over a year and a half and further misunderstandings and speed-bumps does the on-off relationship resolve itself. Its easy to sit back and analyze faults in the pics construction As Anna keeps coming and going out of Williams tiny universe you sit there waiting for scripter Curtis to come up with another unlikely reason for the two to cross paths; some characters (Honey and restaurateur Tony) have clearly suffered from scenes eliminated during post-production; and despite the scripts insistence that William has never had much success with women Grant never really convinces in that respect. Theres a period too during the second half when both the tempo and temperature drop and the movie starts to idle in neutral. But despite these faults the last two reels pack a joyous emotional punch thats extremely moving and returns the pic to its opening tone of funny fairytale-like romance. A crucial late-on line heartbreakingly delivered by Roberts unlocks a reservoir of emotion thats been held at bay by both the plot machinations and the thesps restrained perfs and powers the movie to its cliffhanger ending. If Roberts had fluffed the line the rest of the film might never have worked. While not far from his ""Four Weddings"" persona Grant is fine as the emotional dweeb downplaying his physical shtick and showing surprising iron in Williams character when necessary. His set pieces that scatter the movie (such as posing as a reporter from ""Horse amp; Hound"" magazine at a press junket) are genuinely engaging and Grant melds well with the below-title players among whom Ifans is funny as the troglodyte Spike and McKee especially good as Maxs wheelchair-bound wife Bella. Roberts with the most difficult role in the picture starts slowly but builds through small increments to the powerful ending in which shes simply radiant. Without overdoing the gawkiness or dressing-down thesp manages to convince she has another side to her personality while also remaining a Hollywood star -- especially in one scene in which cornered by the British tabloid press she abruptly switches into cold professional mode. As a technical package the movie is slick in all departments without being glossy. Its certainly the most elaborate production signed by Michell (""Persuasion"" ""Titanic Town"") a former TV director more noted for drawing fine perfs than delivering elaborate-looking goods. Throughout the picture theres a sense of virtuosity being held at bay and only let loose at key moments. The opening and closing are unashamedly bigscreen romantic and to mark key chapter-stops in the narrative Michell slyly inserts arresting sequences -- a vertiginous 150-foot crane shot in a park at night; a clever combo of tracking shots and overlapping dissolves to mark a passage of time and a final lunatic Steadicam sequence which has no purpose except to end the picture on a fun note. Studio interiors (such as the book shop and Williams flat) are smoothly integrated with location work. Trivia buffs will note an uncredited cameo by Alec Baldwin and the fact that a book Grant is reading ""Captain Corellis Mandolin"" is actually Michells next project.

Starring Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant. Directed by Roger Michell. (PG-13. 125 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) A goddess in the form of a movie star descends to Earth in the Notting Hill section of London and falls irrationally in love -- is there any other way? -- with a completely ordinary mortal. This is the wonderful setup for the romantic comedy ""Notting Hill"" and the follow-through is almost as good. ""Notting Hill"" is not perfect. Nothing is perfect. Except Julia Roberts brown eyes. They are bottomless and can give men vertigo. Which is exactly what happens to Hugh Grant when she captures him with her gaze. Star power finds an unlikely match with self-deprecating English humor in ""Notting Hill."" Roberts plays Anna Scott the biggest star in the movie galaxy and mere mortal Grant is diffident bookstore owner William Thacker. They are so right for the roles that it is impossible to imagine anyone else playing them. He has no lips but thats OK. She has lips enough for both of them. It comes as a bonus that this romantic comedy is one of the rare pictures of its type that actually is about something -- the double-edged sword of celebrity. Even people who have never understood the Julia Roberts phenomenon are going to get it this time. As a superstar playing a superstar she is required to turn on the wattage that makes people melt in her presence. She also is required as Anna puts it to become ""just a girl."" Roberts can do that too and everything in between. Absence from the screen has done Grant good. It is perfectly clear why a movie goddess would fall for him. He is comfortable with himself and an endless pleasure to be around. Grants tics and hesitations are no longer just mannerisms but part of an apparently effortless delivery. Thacker is described by another character as someone who used to be handsome but now is ""sort of squidgy around the edges"" and it fits Grant at 38 to a T. Much is made of the reactions of people who meet the famous Anna Scott. Thacker very cool manages not to acknowledge that he knows who she is while at the same time letting her know that he does a neat trick. When she impulsively kisses him he manages not to acknowledge the full effect of that either an even neater trick. He later admits when its clear that their worlds are too far apart and the relationship is not going to work that ""it is as if Ive taken love heroin and cant have it again."" Anna tries to tell Thacker ""The fame thing isnt really real you know."" Of course it is and ""Notting Hill"" revolves around the journalistic fact that those who seek publicity can also be destroyed by it. Both Roberts and Grant in particular have known the klieg light glare of having their personal lives turned into tabloid fodder -- and not just in tabloids but in the mainstream press as well. In addition there is a surprise cameo by a star so big -- and who has had his own dustups with the press -- that the point is not lost on the audience. It is to the movies credit that these celebrity put-downs of the press never seem merely special pleading or self-serving. The comedy always comes first and the two star-turn characters are shown in complex not always favorable light. The goddess Anna can also be rash bad-tempered and unfair. Self-mocking English humor gets a nice workout in warmhearted scenes of get-togethers among old friends. One in particular is a dinner party in which the guests must tell the saddest hard-luck story in order to win the last brownie for dessert. Irony is delivered with a straight face and there is a kind of rueful acknowledgment that life is going to fall short of expectations. There is not a weak link in the supporting cast which includes Emma Chambers as Thackers carrot- topped Raggedy Ann doll of a sister and Tim McInnerny and Gina McKee as an underachieving couple who have accepted their lot. Rhys Ifans stands out as Spike Thackers mangy roommate -- you can almost smell his b.o. -- and a bundle of irrelevancies and non sequiturs. He has terrible teeth exhales smoke through his nose into goggles hangs out in and out of his underwear and puts out his cigarettes in the kitchen sink. The blind dates Thackers friends arrange for him include a self-described ""fruitarian"" who considers cooking vegetables to be murder and eats only fruit that has ""fallen from the branch."" Roberts parades a spiffy variety of costumes that help reflect the complexity of Annas personality. She first wanders into Thackers travel bookstore in the transparent ""star disguise"" of beret dark eyeglasses and leather jacket. In turn she becomes the elegant star giving promotional interviews in pantsuit and mens necktie a self-possessed young woman out on a date at a birthday party in blue jeans the public figure in pale blue suit giving a press conference and the grand star in black gown at an opening. Director Roger Michell uses technical flourishes sparingly but to lovely effect. They always have specific emotional content. In one case an aerial shot isolates a couple on a park bench and in another a long tracking shot follows Thacker now alone down Portobello Road as the seasons change around him. There is a flurry of false climaxes. If you dont like the ending theyve settled on for the film feel free to choose the one you do like.

William is British enough not to go gaga over his extraordinary customer. But hes not quite so blase that he doesnt fall in love with her. Notting Hill is the story of how a self-protective princess and a self-absorbed commoner find happiness together. Its a winningly optimistic fantasy about the power of charm and pulchritude to prevail over common sense the lack of shared hobbies and geographic obstacles. Its pointedly funny about the ludicrous realities of entertainment journalism and their sometimes oxymoronic hybrid. It takes an intrinsically democratic American Roman Holiday-style approach to celebrity In a meritocracy everyones got a crack at capturing the heart of a royal personage. And yet starting with the opaque title -- a reference to the ethnically diverse London neighborhood in which William lives and works notorious in the 1950s as a site of racial unrest and now a highly gentrified and trendy melting pot -- Notting Hill is also the utterly British invention of the superb screenwriter Richard Curtis creator of the 1994 hit Four Weddings and a Funeral after which this confection is so heavily molded. Grant made a name for himself of course in Four Weddings; since then his own celebrity has been advanced more by his liaisons with actress Elizabeth Hurley and streetwalker Divine Brown than by his thespian range. Curtis and director Roger Michell take advantage of Grants gossip-propelled reputation by presenting William as the most un-headline-worthy of proles -- someone who is so forgettable that even his wife has dumped him. Now the eminently eligible ""loser"" gets by on the kindness of a dotty sister (Emma Chambers in a role similar to that of Charlotte Coleman in Four Weddings) and a warm circle of delightful Weddings-ish friends. For extra color the bachelor rooms with a daft Welsh slacker (Rhys Ifans) who would doubtless have been a Weddings player had Curtis not filled the shtick slot instead with Rowan Atkinson as a malaprop-prone vicar. In a rewarding refinement of the Four Weddings premise Williams robust English sense of entitlement is such that hes in love with himself a snob -- attractive but still a snob -- for whom only the worlds most rarefied American movie star will do. (Andie MacDowell was merely a mannequin. Now the stakes are raised.) When Anna walks into Williams cluttered bookshop (an admirably failing independent establishment not unlike the cute childrens store romanticized in Youve Got Mail) naturally these two beautiful people meet and melt. This is how romance among ""mortals"" is supposed to work in the movies The legendarily luminous Julia Roberts represents the pinnacle of movie stardom in a confident performance thats the sum and payoff of everything she has ever learned the hard way about being Julia Roberts. Indeed no other actress could pull off the role with such appeal and authority -- not with Roberts likable combination of dewiness and skittishness warmth and inaccessibility intractability and suggestion of regret that she is alas the worlds highest-paid most tightly caged actress rather than free and anonymous and back home in Georgia. Anna who has developed the sensitive radar the famous rely on to detect the presence of gawkers warms slowly to Williams brand of sincerity. He woos her in fact with his ""ordinariness""; shes won over by a home-cooked dinner with his friends. But Curtis is also canny enough to know that when Anna snaps (ambushed outside her suitors door shes convinced that his roommate tipped off the paparazzi) shes as capable of destructive behavior as bad gossip items regularly gleefully suggest. Yet Notting Hill also believes in an ideal world in which even the privileged are entitled to happiness. And in this director Roger Michell (who made 1995s beautiful Persuasion) collaborates unapologetically creating a utopian urban society in which lovers surmount all obstacles friends supply the constancy of family and independent bookstores survive. In one scene of transporting tenderness Anna and William share a moment in a verdant London park -- a private park pointedly requiring a key for entrance which they crash by scaling the fence. The two share murmurings and then break from one another into twinned separate bubbles of fabulousness. Anna sits on a bench William stands a few steps away. The camera pulls back and up up up. For a moment it is we the moviegoers who are the divinities among the stars in heaven. We are looking down on a love match between stars on earth. And with the great magnanimity of the masses we gladly bestow our blessing on the unmeek.

Screenwriter Richard Curtis and producer Duncan Kenworthy created Hugh Grants first huge international hit film the 1994 ""Four Weddings and a Funeral."" And although ""Notting Hill"" isnt a sequel to that movie it does maintain the same spirit. MULTIMEDIA Pauls Pix ""Notting Hill"" Windows Media 28K 80K Theatrical preview for ""Notting Hill"" Real 28K 80K Windows Media 28K 80K In other words its sweet charming somewhat predictable (although well written) and guaranteed to pluck the heartstrings of the hopelessly romantic. ""Notting Hill"" could also be the date movie of choice this summer -- at least until the July opening of Roberts next romantic comedy ""Runaway Bride"" with Richard Gere. Bowled over in the bookstore In ""Notting Hill"" Roberts plays Anna Scott one of the most famous actresses in the world. Wow. What a stretch. No really Roberts insists shes not playing herself. And she probably isnt. Its hard to say not knowing the woman. But there are obvious similarities. Hugh Grant as William Thacker plays just an everyday British bloke (with a whole lot of hair) who owns a modest bookstore in the Notting Hill section of London. One day Scott wanders into Thackers shop and a bing and a bang and a boom. The film is now off and running with boy-gets-girl boy-loses-girl boy-gets-girl and on and on and on. At the heart of the story is what happens when a regular person gets involved with a famous person and how their lives collide. William is lost in Annas world and she causes a huge sensation in his. When he brings her to his sisters birthday party all the guests trip over themselves trying to impress the big star. Williams sister Honey played with goofy charm by Emma Chambers even follows Anna into the bathroom. On the other hand Williams totally at sea in Annas world when hes mistaken for a journalist at a press junket for her latest film. While stumbling through interviews with Annas fellow actors he claims to be from Horse and Hound magazine and thinks Leonardo DiCaprio is a famous Italian director. British actor Rhys Ifans provides provides a lot of comic mileage as Spike Williams ""slob from hell"" flatmate. Spike is a mad Welshman who runs around in his underwear (with his body that should be against the law) lives like a pig and basically leaves Grants character apologizing to everyone with whom he comes into contact for his roomies gross behavior. Four Weddings and a proven commodity Comparisons to ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" are bound to be made. Once again this is an ensemble cast featuring a tight-knit group of friends with Grants character at the center of it all. The object of that characters affections is once again an American woman. And once again love wins out. If you feel this is too much information about the ending and you really dont know that Grant and Roberts character end up together then you should be careful when meeting people selling bridges or swampland. Since were dealing with the same screenwriter producer and at least some of the same acting talent ""Notting Hill"" and ""Four Weddings"" have similar humor and sensibilities. But ""Notting Hill"" stands alone as another funny and heartwarming story about love against all odds. MORE MOVIE REVIEWS SITES Sunshine Boys and Girls Talk Talk Talk Talk Kiss Titan A.E.

All the other supporting players are British television stars and all rise to the occasion of this big-budget feature film. Final verdict? Oh please. Grant and Roberts in a romantic comedy -- this is a no-brainer. ""Notting Hill"" opens nationwide on Friday May 28 and is rated PG-13 with a running time of 121 minutes.

"Notting Hill (PG-13) Related Item ""Notting Hill"" showtimes Notting Hill Easy to Love By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday May 28 1999 Acting up Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts charmingly play themselves. (Universal) Director Roger Michell Cast Julia Roberts;Hugh Grant; Alec Baldwin; Emma Chambers; Hugh Bonneville; Tim McInnerny; Gina McKee; Rhys Ifans Running Time 2 hours 4 minutes Contains sexual situations and some strong language I just spent the night with Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant and I still love myself in the morning. The movies called ""Notting Hill"" and its about nothing more or less than Boy meets Girl. But theres something different and special about this romantic comedy. What is it? Movie stars - especially these two - are always playing lovers. They see someone across the room thats it. A little bit of jokey bantering flirting and fighting then theyre knotsville - married and processed. Love affairs in the movies arent built for surprise. But Grant and Roberts build an exciting fire between them dealing in their inimitably charming way with all those extinguishing factors such as social differences bad timing and meddlesome roommates. The surprise factor in ""Notting Hill"" amounts to personality The more you learn about them the more you see how they react to each other the better it gets. In the end the movie works because Grant and Roberts are disarming geniuses at playing themselves - and then some. William Thacker (Grant) the reserved shy owner of a London travel bookstore looks up from his account books one day to see Anna Scott (Roberts) the worlds most famous movie star. Her face adorns every bus and newsstand in London. People go slack-jawed when they see her. In other words were talking about Julia Roberts right there browsing through his bookstore Williams not much of a moviegoer but you can see hes terribly taken by Ms. Scott - whom he does recognize to his credit. Shes hidden in beret sunglasses and star attitude. But William is very polite and proper about the whole thing being English. He issues those endearing Grantian mumblings and bumblings as he recommends one travel book over the other. She chooses the other of course. When William tells friends and family about this encounter with fame - which just happened to take place when his bookstore colleague had stepped out for a minute - they cant believe it. But what could possibly happen between a megastar whos just passing through London and a reticent bookworm whos still recovering from a divorce and sharing a flat with the worlds most embarrassing roommate (Rhys Ifans)? What would be the chances of him bumping into her accidentally spilling a drink over her rushing her to his Notting Hill flat to clean up and . . . ? Could never happen. The movie marks a reunion for Grant screenwriter Richard Curtis and producer Duncan Kenworthy who worked together on a little thing called ""Four Weddings and a Funeral."" Indeed the similarities between the two movies are inescapable Grant pines once again for an elusive woman who is forever appearing and reappearing in his life. But he doesnt wear so much wedding gear this time. And theres a different sweeter fabric to this movie thanks to director Roger Michell who also made ""Persuasion"" possibly the best Jane Austen romance on screen. Its not just the headliners who bring us into this movie. Screenwriter Curtis has painted a charming delicately tinted extended family life around William. Sure they all seem to have been reculled from the guest list of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral."" But theyre all endearing and spirited including Emma Chambers as Williams cute slightly barmy sister; Hugh Bonneville as an unsuccessful stockbroker who doesnt recognize Anna Scott in one amusing dinner conversation; and Tim McInnerny and Gina McKee as a happily married twosome and Williams indefatigable support group. In the comic relief corner Ifans is hilarious as Grants roommate Spike a gangly Welshman with a heart of gold no sense of tact and most definitely one screw loose. It isnt just Grant and Roberts angling for that first kiss that makes ""Notting Hill"" an affair to remember. Its the sight of Spike standing in his standard-issue white underpants and flexing what he considers to be a stunning body.
