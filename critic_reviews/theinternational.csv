Their financial tendrils are everywhere because real global power is about controlling debt. They are the International Bank of Business and Credit. Yes the money men are the new villains in this timely thriller which sets the rumpled integrity of Interpol agent Clive Owen and pinched determination of US investigator Naomi Watts on the trail of skullduggery resulting when the IBBC hires a consultant (read hitman) to cover its tracks. The quest for truth and justice involves a familiar parade of shady meetings car chases punch-ups and a truly spectacular shoot-out inside New Yorks Guggenheim though the increasingly scrambled plotting doesnt quite measure up to director Tom Tykwers slinky elegant handling of it.Eventually you just let the tangled double-crossing take care of itself and enjoy the way the film defiantly bucks the contemporary thriller trend for shaky-cam coverage and lightning cuts. Instead theres a slow-burning pleasure to be had from the pellucid clarity of Tykwers widescreen framing the way he sets up scenes with an ominously stately aerial glide over cityscapes and gleaming modern architecture. While Owen does scruffy steeliness as well as any man alive this is less about the performers than sustained subtle unease adeptly orchestrated by the electric undertow of Tykwer Reinhold and Klimeks suavely insidious score. A shame really that the story folds in the final third but for its sculptural qualities theres much to savour here. Frank Lloyd Wright aficionados prepare yourselves.

Not exactly what I expected from a conspiracy-espionage movie but certainly one of the best laughs Ive had in years; it happened when Clive Owen released yet another devastating cliche of a sentence seconds after I pointed out to my partner who watched with me that the script sounds like a collection of all-time-favourites from American films. Sadly the whole movie wasnt entertaining at all. The plot was chewed-up and every move was explained in tedious manner; no annoying couples in the movie theater needed to explain the moves because they were so obvious. I felt like I was in the ""Idiots Guide to Espionage Films"". The only likely explanation to Owens angry face is that he was put out by the poorly-written dialouges. The music was out-of-touch with the rhythm of the scenes and the plot wandered between side characters to no avail and without creating any true feelings for either of them. All in all it was a movie that seemed as if it went on for three hours completely incohesive and not with a single sex scene or car chase (that would not have compensated for anything.) A few stunning views are far from being worth the time. Final thought It seemed like the best idea the movie makers could come up with was ""Hey lets do an action scene at the Gugenheim That would be cool"". Well thats not a bad idea but please make sure that the police dont take 8 minutes to reach the scene and that for no apparent reason the assassin will join forces with his chaser and really just save the money and dont make a movie that looks like a Bourne movie on Prozac.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/85706/the-international.html,200,theinternational2,theinternational,timeout

By David Denby Share Tweet Table of Contents Andrzej Wajdas movie tells the story of the Katyn massacre in 1940. Credit Illustration by Tom Bachtell I have been to Poland just once briefly in 1978 to talk about movies but I kept meeting people there who wanted to talk about something else--the Soviet betrayal of their country. In particular they were obsessed with a single event the murder of Polish officers in the Katyn forest near Smolensk in 1940. For many Poles the lies spread about this massacre amounted to a virtual negation of the countrys identity. ""Katyn"" a stunning epic film directed by Andrzej Wajda is an attempt to settle the truth of the affair once and for all. In such films as ""Ashes and Diamonds"" (1958) and ""Man of Iron"" (1981) Wajda whos now eighty-two has dramatized the issues of Polish politics and national destiny and at the beginning of ""Katyn"" he reminds us with onscreen titles of the twin events that turned his countrys fate into a joke between two dictators. On September 1 1939 Hitlers forces invaded Poland; on September 17th the Red Army did too and the country was split into two occupied zones. The Soviets then captured around ten thousand Polish Army officers. What to do with them? Stalin was murderously prescient; he may have anticipated the future of the war--the coming German invasion of the Soviet Union and the Soviet recovery and counterattack which in the event rolled through Eastern Europe--and in that future he had his own plans for Poland. During April and May of 1940 the Soviet secret police the N.K.V.D. shot nearly all the captured officers--many of them reservists who had built careers as engineers doctors and teachers--and dumped their bodies in mass graves in the Katyn forest and at other N.K.V.D. execution sites. At the same time many other Poles held in Soviet custody were also shot. In all more than twenty thousand people were killed. Then came the second betrayal during the long Soviet domination of Poland after the war the crime was officially blamed on the Nazis. Its as if Polands grasp of the truth had been taken away along with its sovereignty. In ""Katyn"" after the opening titles smoke and clouds fill the air and the camera slowly moves through the murk and takes in a bridge filled with people converging from two directions. It is September 1939. A group entering from one end is fleeing the Germans; a group entering from the other is fleeing the Soviets and they mingle in abject confusion. Wajdas movie is based on a novel by Andrzej Mularczyk ""Post-Mortem"" and it manages the feat of telling the story of a nation through typical characters who nevertheless retain their individuality. A captain Andrzej (Artur Zmijewski) held captive by the Soviets says goodbye to his wife; he keeps a diary thereafter which occasionally forms the movies narration but he never fully understands whats happening to him. ""Katyn"" re-creates one of the everyday terrors of living under totalitarianism no one in power ever tells you the truth and you live on rumor and hope. The captains stubborn wife Anna (Maja Ostaszewska) longing for his return goes to live with his parents in Nazi-occupied western Poland. Earlier we had seen the Nazis arrest her father-in-law a professor along with most of the faculty of Krakows Jagiellonian University--all the men middle-aged or even elderly hustled into trucks and taken away without explanation. Wajda goes back and forth between the sudden stunning seizure of large groups of people and the intimate moments of companionship among their families waiting for news--any news. The scenes are curt decisive and unsentimental to the point of bluntness. ""Katyn"" has the severity of an old mans work--forceful plain statement and implication convey all that Wajda wants to say. Once the Red Army kicks the Nazis out of Poland and local Communists backed by the Soviets begin to take over the new society forms itself in part around the Katyn lie perpetrated by the Soviet ""liberators""--a lie enforced by prison for those who will not accept it. It is a situation of excruciating irony at least part of the population agrees to the fiction in order to forestall still worse repression and to save whatever it can of Polands integrity as a nation and a culture. ""There will never be a free Poland"" a bitter woman says. Wajda takes us into the Communist period and only at the very end of the movie as if recalling a nightmare that had been suppressed by everyone does he show us what actually happened in 1940. The officers are shot in a basement one by one with a single bullet through the head or pushed to the edge of a pit and killed there. The scene plays in virtual silence interrupted only by the repeated pistol shots. Before it is over we know that Wajda has made one of the movies most potent evocations of a gruesome twentieth-century ritual; we know as well that only in a free Poland could he have created this particular spectacle. (The Soviets didnt officially admit the truth about Katyn until 1990 as their authority was waning.) Wajda has exorcised feelings that may have burdened him since he was a teen-ager his own father Jakub Wajda a decorated fighter in the First World War was among the officers killed. This tenacious artist has now given his father a proper memorial and has reasserted with power and grace the history and identity of his nearly effaced country. A spindly metal claw like a tarantula made of steel squeezes under a door and comes right at you; hummingbirds hover before your face; a ride on a trapeze becomes a vertiginous swing into the depths. The animated ""Coraline"" seen in its 3-D version now and then uses the third dimension aggressively for nose-biting or swooping but most of the time the writer-director Henry Selick working from Neil Gaimans novel extends his reach into space as a way of increasing mobility and adventure--as a gift to imagination. Theres a lot of barrelling through tunnels and dashing into rooms and some very startling effects such as when the heroine Coraline (voiced by Dakota Fanning) a spunky eleven-year-old girl is walking with an all-knowing cat (Keith David) and both of them are under the control of a witch who suddenly turns everything around them piece by piece into white blankness. All dimensions it seems can be erased. ""Coraline"" is a beautifully designed rather scary answered-prayer story the little girl longs for more attention than shes getting from her parents so she enters a parallel world in which her parents are very attentive indeed--so attentive that they want to take control of her sew buttons into her eyes and turn her into a ghost child. All her neighbors are there too in slightly altered form and the movie is filled with both sinister and enchanting transformations as when the two portly retired British music-hall performers who live in Coralines house burst out of their shells of voluminous bosom and elephantine waist and fly through the air as slender graceful young maidens. Animation is the art in which all wishes sweet and sour eventually come true. The sleek iron-gray thriller ""The International"" is the first of what will undoubtedly be a series of movies that melodramatize the banking industry as the ultimate in wickedness. The Luxembourg-based institution in the movie known as I.B.B.C. and clearly modelled on the infamous Bank of Credit and Commerce International (B.C.C.I.) serves as a middleman in mayhem-producing arms deals and buys off or assassinates anyone who tries to investigate its criminal behavior. Yet two virtuous people an Interpol agent (Clive Owen) and a Manhattan assistant district attorney (Naomi Watts) refuse to be intimidated and chase the bad guys all over the world. Killer banks may be new to the movies but theres nothing else original in this if-its-Tuesday-this-must-be-Istanbul thriller with its portentous globe-hopping and racing through colorful street bazaars. And theres a big hole in the middle of the movie the director Tom Tykwer and the screenwriter Eric Warren Singer forgot to make their two crusaders human beings. Clive Owen unshaven and foul-tempered stares and stares in outraged frustration but not even this excellent actor and his beautiful dark eyes can create a role entirely out of wrath. For those who like tony scenes of wealth ""The International"" offers amusingly austere impressions of high-style skullduggery--men with closely cropped beards and perfectly tailored suits meeting in circular sparsely furnished conference rooms and climbing into shiny black Audis. Yet one cant help feeling that Tykwers visual panache is beside the point. The real-world bank story is about the banality of greed not about murder ordered at the highest levels. For years thousands of ordinary financial workers created sliced up and repackaged ridiculous investments not in bursts of viciousness but as a careless exercise of avarice. No one I imagine will make a movie about that kind of banking though Id like to see Mel Brooks give it a try complete with a male chorus the Derivative Boys dancing with a BlackBerry in one hand and shooting quarterly-statement airplanes into the audience with the other.

By David Edelstein Published Feb 15 2009 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Kock Lorber Films and Film Forum) Watching Andrzej Wajdas unnervingly even-tempered Katyn you wonder why the Poles who managed to live through World War II and the dual occupation of the Germans and Soviets did not go mad Survival and sanity appear to be mutually exclusive. The movie is named for the forest where in 1940 the Soviets secretly executed 15000 Polish officers artists educators intellectualsthe best and brightest among them the 14-year-old Wajdas father. The overture is out of the Theatre of the Absurd. Its 1939 and two waves of civilians mostly women and children surge onto opposite ends of a bridge and collide in the middle One group screams that the Nazis are behind them the other that the Bolshies are behind them. Do they go forward? Backward? They cant stay put. In the pandemonium people push past one another in both directions while Anna (Maja Ostaszewska) grabs her little daughter and heads for the park where the Soviets have detained her husband Andrzej (Artur Zmijewski) and other officers. She begs him to flee; he says he must be true to his military pledge and remain with his soldiers. Andrzej the obvious stand-in for Wajdas father cant figure out why hes a POW. Of his Soviet captors he says There was no war with them In his early eighties Wajda finally tells the story that has haunted much of his work which began with the tumultuous war trilogy of A Generation (1954) Kanal (1957) and Ashes and Diamonds (1958). There are two likely reasons why he didnt make Katyn after those films (1) The Communists late-fifties tolerance for moral and artistic complexity was short-lived and (2) the Soviets attributed the Katyn massacre to the Nazis and were touchy when correctedi.e. they shot people. The vanquished Germans having liquidated a significant number of Europeans could hardly mount a credible defense. Wajda does not tell this story from the perspective of the child he was but there is something childlike about the movies lack of context. What I mean is No one spells out why bad things are happening to bewildered people. We know of course why the Nazis haul people off An SS man labels professors who naively gather to discuss academic freedom hostile to Germany and thats the last anyone sees of them. But why do the Soviets come for men women and children? Andrzej his lieutenant Jerzy (Andrzej Chyra) and their general (Jan Englert) stand around a frigid barracks overseen by blank-faced Soviet guards; no one in power speaks to them. This is a vacuuman indifferent universe only fleetingly warmed by their prayers and songs. To make sense of what we see we have to go outside the film to know that even as Stalin was gearing up to fight Hitler he was thinking about the corrosive effect of independent thinkers on Poland a country he planned to rule through Communist apparatchiks. It was less trouble to clean house before he fully moved in. The arbitrary brutal suppression of knowledge of culture of ones system of values of ones very history The themethe vacuumis central to so much of postwar Polish fiction and drama; it is central to even the Jewish perspective of Roman Polanskis The Pianist. (There are no Jews in Katyn however.) In Wajdas film Anna and her daughter barely escape a Soviet roundup and flee to German-ruled Krakow where they are safer. They scan the newspaper and listen to readings of the list of the Polish dead in the city squarepraying fervently that Andrzej wont be on it. What actually happened to her husband and others only sees the light for propagandas sake. The Nazis document the exhumation of the Katyn corpses on film as proof that the Soviets are worse than they are. They express their sincere condolences to the late generals wife (Danuta Stenka) then ask her to read a denunciation of the USSR. When she demurs they ask her again more insistently then raise the possibility of Auschwitz What should she do? Determining the costbenefit ratiothe Soviets would have killed her already and did kill her husband but the Nazis are killing Poles and the Polish resistance could kill her for collaborating and the Soviets might win the war and eliminate her but she could be put on a train to Auschwitz that dayrequires the higher math. The last section of Katynafter the waris less morally dizzying. The stakes are stark Accept the Soviet version of Katyn and live fatally compromised or broadcast the truth and die. A couple of idealistic young peoplea man and a womandemonstrate their resolve to reject the counterfeit history The film does not end with them hoisted aloft by cheering crowds. I confess that at times I agreed with the reluctant compromisers the ones who said You cant bring back the Katyn dead. Dont get yourself killed. Live until Poland is free again. Wajda at least gives those people dignity. 1 2 Next Share this story...

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor February 14 2009 Save for later Saved Naomi Watts and Clive Owen star in The International. Berlinale/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The German director Tom Tykwer is best known for ""Run Lola Run."" His new film ""The International"" stars Clive Owen and might as well be called ""Run Clive Run.""Owen plays an Interpol agent Louis Salinger who teams with Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Eleanor Whitman (Naomi Watts in a rather thankless role) to bring one of the worlds most powerful banks to justice. (Salinger Whitman - want to bet that screenwriter Eric Warren Singer was an English major?)This is one of those global thrillers that comes on like a travel brochure. Berlin Milan and Istanbul are the big backdrops. On the surface at least it all seems very James Bond-ish except that Tykwer overdoes the grayed-out clamminess of these locations especially Berlin. The big bad bankers of IBBC - a fictitious corporation not so subtly reminiscent of the real-life BCCI which collapsed amid scandals in 1991 - are a sleek crew of cut-throats. They seem all of a piece with the cold reflecting surfaces of their boardrooms. Salinger by contrast looks like an unmade bed. ""You look terrible"" Whitman tells him at one point and he doesnt disagree. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? But Salingers grubbiness is intended as a badge of integrity. The IBBC is more than a big bank its an omnivorous entity that foments wars finances weapon sales and assassinates with impunity. All governments from the democratic to the totalitarian are in its debt. If your grandmother was standing in the way of the IBBC it would gleefully run her over. Thats how bad it is. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review The International I suppose that what with the global economic crisis one could make a case for the timeliness of ""The International."" You wont find that case made here dear reader. Dont judge a movie by its packaging. ""The International"" has about as much to do with current crises as ""Mamma Mia""What its mainly about is movie stars skittering from locale to locale while bullets whiz by and the plot thickens - or more to the point curdles. The characters are always explaining to one another - i.e. us - what is supposed to be going on. ""What are you proposing exactly?"" is a generic line of dialogue in ""The International."" And the answers are not always helpful. After about a half hour I gave up trying to decipher the curlicue plot. From the look of things so did the filmmakers. In one particularly egregious instance in Manhattan Salinger hits a dead end in his search for a notorious IBBC hitman (Brian F. OByrne) and then - presto - the bad guy just happens to saunter by.The sighting at least leads to a pretty good set piece a shoot-out inside the Guggenheim Museum with its winding ramps and nouveau art installations. Most of the scene needless to say was not shot at the actual Guggenheim but the trickery is expert. So is the staging although the behavior of the shooters doesnt always parse. Why would the bad guy known only as The Consultant take off his bulletproof vest just because its cumbersome - the vest that saved his life? Doesnt he know its better to be uncomfortable than dead?The great German actor Armin Mueller-Stahl shows up as a former Commie-turned-IBBC operative and he has a speech in which he explains to Salinger that fiction unlike life has to make sense. He must not have read the script.Just in case we thought ""The International"" was just a shoot-em-up with headline-grabbing pretensions Tykwer by the end frames it as a moral quest. Salinger you see realizes that he can only defeat the IBBC-ers by in essence becoming as bad as they are. His homicides are supposed to serve a higher cause. So he ends up a good bad good guy or something like that. To my eyes Salingers real-world victory represents a moral defeat but thats not the way Tykwer sees it. The sour taste of revenge is pretty sweet here. Grade B- (Rated R for some sequences of violence and language.)

Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Sony Pictures Show Me The Money Naomi Watts plays a Manhattan assistant DA to Owens secret agent. Sony Pictures Not every movie lucks into the kind of timing thats allowing The International to advertise itself as ""the perfect thriller for our time."" But having made a bank their villain -- a bank mind you not a banker -- director Tom Tykwer and his screenwriters have pretty firmly captured the zeitgeist. Of course their movie trades in higher forms of finance than most of us find at our local ATMs. Tykwer prefers a less regulated sort that involves shootouts on rooftops and in art galleries and that might interest a rugged Interpol agent played by Clive Owen. (Whose soulful drizzly opening-shot close-up prompted a woman near me to mutter ""Clive Owen and rain ... this is already great."") For those who appreciate eye-candy better when its accompanied by a bit of narrative theres a plot about brokering Third World weapons sales a nicely understated supporting performance by Armin Mueller-Stahl as a former Stasi assassin and much unnecessary but picturesque globe-trotting as our hunky Interpol agent teams up (for reasons of billing I have to assume) with a New York assistant district attorney played by Naomi Watts. A trip to Milan allows them to discover that facilitating the sale of arms is only a side issue for the fictional IBBC bank. The institutions real aim is to gain control of Third World debt a goal that apparently requires the virtual dismantling -- bullet-hole by bullet-hole -- of New Yorks Guggenheim Museum. (Frank Lloyd Wright fans can relax; a life-sized replica of his ramped interior was built and then shot-up in a German factory.) Tykwer being something of an architecture freak controlling Third World debt also requires a trip to the rooftops of Istanbul to Zaha Hadids BMW factory (relocated from Wolfsburg to the base of a Mediterranean cliff) and to Daniel Libeskinds Jewish Museum in Berlin. All great fun in a story thats more kinetic than compelling.

Some balance may be restored though by the extraordinary Italian film ""Gomorrah."" The title is a play on words one thats justified by the timeless nature of the evil under scrutiny. Matteo Garrones dark epic based on a book of the same name by Roberto Saviano dramatizes the contemporary workings of the Camorra the criminal empire that plagues the southern regions of Naples and Caserta. As Italys official entry in this years Academy Awards ""Gomorrah"" will not be accused of pushing tourism. Its a vision of criminality as a vast miasma that has settled on whole cities and industries spawning violence as it spreads. The malignity can be oppressive -- this is a far cry from Fellini finding poignant uplift in the slums -- but the dramatic structure is complex the details are instructive and the sense of tragedy is momentous. More ENLARGE Italian director Matteo Garrones fresh gritty take on the crime families of Naples in ""Gomorrah."" Read the article. The opening sequence which contains the first of many shocks suggests that Mr. Garrone will aestheticize his gritty subject. The first image dark-blue-hued and accompanied by whirring fans is ambiguous and hard to read. Soon it resolves into an extreme close-up of a strong face eyes closed as if in ecstasy. A Mafia offshoot of Blue Man Group? No just a thug in a tanning parlor and a kind of blue herring in a film whose aesthetic owes much to the austere traditions of Italian neo-realism. The slums are seen at an emotional distance as beehives of striving and predation. (A memorable tableau of a moldering apartment complex shows drug dealers and their clients clogging one walkway while a bride and groom lead a wedding procession along the walkway below them.) And the Camorras reach into such enterprises as garbage removal and haute couture is traced with almost anthropological ambition. ENLARGE From Italy Ciro Petrone in director Matteo Garrones Gomorrah which is based on the book by Roberto Saviano. IFC Films/Everett Collection Still its impossible to watch ""Gomorrah"" without feeling compassion for helpless innocents trapped in endless turf wars along with horror at amoral affectless kids doing the bidding of murderous elders. (A youngster probably in his late teens exudes optimism over the prospect of a local sociopath rising to power ""Ill live for 30 years if hes the boss here."") In one of the five narrative strands woven together from material in the book by Saviano (whos currently living under police protection) a master tailor urges garment workers to work with love; he will meet a terrible fate. In another a manufacturer negotiates with a crooked trucking executive for disposing of his factorys highly toxic waste; he says his only concern is that the disposal be clean. If theres a single scene that speaks for the bleak whole its a vista of a giant quarry where monster trucks dump the waste secretly and illegally. The Camorra touches everything in ""Gomorrah"" leaving nothing clean. Two Lovers Joaquin Phoenix has been saying that ""Two Lovers"" will be his last film; he plans to quit acting and devote himself to his music career. Heres hoping for a change of heart. This is an inspired performance by a superb actor in an elegantly grave romantic drama. James Grays fourth feature takes the form of a love triangle with a broken line on one side. Mr. Phoenixs Leonard Kraditor lives with his parents in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn. Leonard in his 30s can be charming enough to pass himself off as an integrated personality and his dilemma would seem to be a familiar one -- how to choose between an alluring neurotic with a drug habit (Gwyneth Paltrows Michelle who lives in his building) and an attractive earnest yearner (Vinessa Shaws Sandra) who thinks she loves him. But Leonard isnt close enough to himself to make choices. He can hardly find a coherent self in the fragments of his fractured psyche so he darts and lurches from one woman to the other enamored and unmoored. (In a film distinguished by dense texture and smart casting Isabella Rossellini plays Leonards mother Moni Monoshov is his father and Elias Koteas is Michelles icy lover.) DVD Focus ENLARGE Open City (1945) Roberto Rossellini -- Isabella Rossellinis father -- made this pioneering neo-realist masterpiece on the streets of Rome only weeks after the Allies liberated the city. Shot on a shoestring with whatever shards of film stock could be found ""Open City"" looks like a documentary and has often been mistaken for one even though the story takes some lurid turns. (Chief among them is a lesbian Gestapo agent.) The subject is survival with honor during the waning days of Nazi domination. The great Anna Magnani leads a cast that is for the most part nonprofessional. The script was written by Sergio Amidei with help from 25-year-old Federico Fellini. ENLARGE Wedding Crashers (2005) Isla Fisher got her first prominent feature role in this exuberant comedy starring Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson about motor-mouthed con men who crash wedding receptions to pick up girls. When the movie opened I described her character Gloria as a giggly rapacious sexpot played by Ms. Fisher with startling brio. The film was directed by David Dobkin from a script by Steve Faber and Bob Fisher (no relation as far as I know). The supporting cast includes such heavy hitters as Will Ferrell and Christopher Walken but Isla Fisher shows them a thing or two about comedic precision and verve. ENLARGE La Strada (1954) James Grays ""Two Lovers"" ends on a beach in an homage to -- or just an open borrowing from -- Fellinis most beloved film which won an Oscar in 1957. Fellinis wife Giulietta Masina is the innocent wide-eyed waif Gelsomina; she is sold by her mother to the brutish circus strongman Zampano (Anthony Quinn) who falls in love with her. Richard Basehart plays Il Matto a clown and the third side of an emergent triangle. ""La Strada"" resembles ""Gomorrah"" in its settings of Italian poverty but the source of its enduring popularity is its romantic soul. For a filmmaker who has made his reputation with such crime thrillers as ""Little Odessa"" and ""The Yards"" James Gray reveals an unexpected gift for the mysteries of romance. He and his co-writer Richard Menello set up an unlikely coupling -- gorgeous Gwyneth living in Leonards musty apartment house? -- that becomes in the course of the film not just plausible but fatefully obsessive. (In one marvelous silent moment Leonard leans over Michelle as she sleeps and inhales her breath.) Ms. Paltrow has never been more intriguing on screen or more audacious. She plays Michelle as a radiant child with thwarted ambitions and insatiable needs; its perfectly clear why Leonard cant resist her. On his side though nothing is clear and thats the genius of Joaquin Phoenixs performance. Rather than familiar symptoms of diagnosable distress (someone whispers a superfluous whisper about bipolar disease) Leonard presents eerie furtiveness sporadic charisma body language with scrambled syntax and broadband passion that cant be channeled. Its a fearsome spectacle. Under the Sea 3D Every time I see an underwater IMAX film in 3D Im astounded -- a big word but the only right word -- by the intimacy of the experience. With the Polaroid glasses off the screen is huge far away and all aswirl with fuzzy pictures. With them on brilliantly sharp images sit inches from your face and the oyster is your world. ""Under the Sea 3D"" is one of the best of the genre. If it doesnt serve oysters per se this submarine wonder offers marvels in abundance. A swarm of catfish rolls to and fro in unison like a liquid tumbleweed. A formation of eels standing upright in a sandy bottom waves in unison like pencil-slender sirens. Giant cuttlefish change color as readily as politicians. Jellyfish pulsate erotically reef squid roam translucently great white sharks drift ominously and a huge potato cod barely misses bumping into my nose. Something is different however and it takes a while to realize what it is. ""Under the Sea 3D"" doesnt exult in the oceans extraplanetary extravagance as previous films have. Plenty of fish are in evidence no worry about that and not just fish but baby sea lions and leafy sea dragons plus intermittent showers of plankton. But theres a tincture of solemnity to the narration delivered by Jim Carrey a bringing of news about how global warming may be raising the oceans acidity and thereby threatening such undersea life as the Great Barrier Reef the largest living structure on earth. This is a 4D film really the fourth dimension being education. It targets young audiences in particular with the message that our planet is in trouble from top to bottom. The International ""You need to relax"" someone says to a driver in the opening scene of ""The International."" The driver replies ""Im more comfortable tense."" Its a good line in a bad picture filled with cryptic someones going through the motions of a spy thriller. Motion is in copious supply -- a frenzied shootout at Manhattans Guggenheim Museum grows interminable -- but the workings of the abstract plot are unfathomable the characters are unpleasant and a couple of assassinations leave us as cold as the corpses. Instead of ""The Parallax View"" its The Jaundiced View occasionally relieved by striking views of Berlin Milan and Istanbul. Video Watch a Scene From ""The International"" The director was Tom Tykwer who has done two very fine films ""Run Lola Run"" and ""Heaven""; hes the sole reason Im going on about this hollow new charade. (Like those two ""The International"" was shot by the splendid cinematographer Frank Griebe but his work was sabotaged by a washed-out print at the screening I attended.) Clive Owen gimlet-eyed and angry from start to finish is an Interpol agent who joins forces with a Manhattan D.A. played doggedly by Naomi Watts -- the D.A. is happily married so forces are all they ever join -- to defeat a multinational bank thats killing people and stirring up trouble around the world by financing the sale of arms. The skeletal script by Eric Warren Singer is prescient if nothing else in its depiction of a financial institution thats dangerously leveraged and out of control. We hear a lot about bad banks these days but this is a really baaad bank. Confessions of a Shopaholic ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"" sounds like it might have been rendered totally irrelevant by the economic turndown. But no this silly chick flick starring Isla Fisher has a base or two covered and could even be seen -- this is a stretch but Im bending over backward here -- as a Cassandra-like warning from the pre-September 15th era. The young shopper in question Rebecca Bloomwood packs a dozen credit cards in her purse and courts disaster with her free-spending free-charging ways. The disaster occurs when she becomes by preposterous inadvertence a nationally famous financial sage who counsels credit-card restraint. The production renders totally irrelevant all hopes for a well-made movie. Its one of those ragged pandemonious studio comedies that hammers at plot points in every contrived scene. But Ms. Fisher has a few moments worthy of her abundant comedic gifts -- my favorite is a fan dance -- and the cast includes Hugh Dancy who is calm and engaging as the editor of a financial magazine and Kristin Scott Thomas who visits a ripe French accent on a more-than-vaguely Vogueish version of Anna Wintour.

"The International Dont bank on this ho-hum thriller | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsThe International Dont bank on this ho-hum thriller""The difference between truth and fiction"" one shifty guy is telling another ""is that fiction has to make sense.""Clive Owen is the only person in The International who works up a sweat.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Feb. 13 2009 The International (out of 4)Starring Clive Owen Naomi Watts and Armin Mueller-Stahl. Directed by Tom Tykwer. 117 minutes. At select GTA theatres. 14A ""The difference between truth and fiction"" one shifty guy is telling another ""is that fiction has to make sense.""Huh? Coming midway through The International a film by Tom Tykwer that squanders a golden opportunity to make money on the current economic meltdown the line sounds heavy but drifts away in a fog. So does most of the bromide-larded dialogue penned by rookie screenwriter Eric Warren Singer whose previous job must have been writing for fortune cookies.The reality is that neither truth nor fiction make much sense in this movie. Singer loosely bases his script on a real Pakistan bank that fronted a global arms-dealing operation from the 1970s to early 1990s but the movies faux International Bank of Business and Credit (IBBC) is blandly European and devoid of interest.There is no Bernie Madoff scam artist behind the IBBC or even a cabal of greedy or incompetent financiers all of which have been alternately terrifying and amusing the masses these many months. Instead we get vanilla lenders played by the likes of Armin Mueller-Stahl and Ulrich Thomsen whose Armanis glide softly and who have no boo-worthy tics. They dont even seem interested in making a profit.All these guys really want to do another shifty character informs us is enslave people with heavy debt ""You control the debt you control everything."" Whatever. Theyre also moderately interested in selling arms to hot spots in developing nations weapons they buy cheap in China and then flog to the highest bidder. Anybody who objects is quietly rubbed out but objections are few because (insert evil laugh here) ""everyone is involved.""The only person who works up a sweat in The International is Clive Owen playing former Scotland Yard agent Louis Salinger now working for Interpol who apparently has been chasing the IBBC for some time. The chase has cost him much sleep and many hot meals and hotter dates and also sent his anger-management issues skyward. Hes so jumpy he even slaps around corpses. He has no great sleuthing skills but he does seem possessed with the ability to read minds and spot villains at great distances all by screwing up his face and peering intently. (Owen gave up a chance to play James Bond for this?)Salinger is paired for no apparent reason other than this being a U.S.-German co-production with New York assistant district attorney Eleanor Whitman (Naomi Watts) who occasionally gets to fly to Europe to express shock at Salingers roughhouse methods or to get smacked around by the Euro baddies.The International lives up to its name by jumping from place to place - Berlin Istanbul Milan and Lyon are also on the itinerary - but theres really only one spot that the over-caffeinated Tykwer (Run Lola Run) cares about. Its the Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan or rather a perfect backlot repro of it where Tykwer stages the grandest of his set pieces. A shootout there between Salinger and faceless stooges of the IBBC results in so many rounds of ammo being fired its a wonder the building is still standing.Examine that beautiful structure please. It brings to mind the imposing architecture of The Parallax View the 1974 Alan J.

Clive Owen as ""Louis Salinger"" in Columbia Pictures thriller THE INTERNATIONAL. Photo Jay Maidment Sony Pictures 2009 Movie review The International thrills 1 / 2 Back to Gallery The International Drama. Starring Clive Owen Naomi Watts and Armin Mueller-Stahl. Directed by Tom Tykwer. (R. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The International"" wont go down as an action thriller for the record books but its a pretty good one for right now. First of all the villain is a bank. Hows that for timing? Like the bank the movie has its tentacles into everything wars geopolitics finance the developing world local law enforcement Europe the United States. In an unsophisticated but instinctively right sort of way ""The International"" which opened this years Berlin Film Festival and goes into general release today strives to be a movie about the modern world. The message Its a big mess. The pessimism in ""The International"" is of a kind we havent seen since the 1970s. Action thrillers are normally the realm of good guys and bad guys after all of simple moral schemes. This picture has its heroes and villains too but mainly it suggests that things have gotten way past that old model. Director Tom Tykwer presents a world in which the systems that people live under are so corrupting that theres no pure stance left for the individual to adopt either in support of the beast or in opposition to it. Life morality and selfhood are irrelevant. The bank owns everything and people are interchangeable just tenants populating the earth for the time being. Clive Owen stars as an idealistic man who still believes. Hes an Interpol agent whose obsessive mission is to expose the banks corruption and bring it down. We first meet him in close-up in the rain looking anxious and pensive. For the rest of the movie he still looks as if its raining. We begin in Berlin where Louis (Owen) hopes to get a crucial piece of evidence against the bank. But the bank is like an evil Santa Claus. It knows when Interpol witnesses are sleeping knows when theyre awake and knows how to cause a car accident or fatal heart attack when necessary. Think of ""The International"" as a thriller of the future made in the language of the past. The story and situation are complex while the characters are routine and the dialogue occasionally clunks. Because in a thriller things like story are more important than clever repartee the films flaws can be ignored but before you ignore them you notice them. Naomi Watts plays an American government agent and shes about as believable as the idea of Naomi Watts as a government agent. Shes appealing but only because of her personality and star wattage. Shes in lots of scenes but the role isnt much. Owen fares better in that he gets to play the character in transition. Louis is a driven humorless uncompromising man whose sense of justice compels him to find out more about the world than anyone would want to know. Hes ably matched by Armin Mueller-Stahl as a former German communist who works in the upper reaches of the bank. As an idealist who long ago lost his soul Mueller-Stahl is the nightmare of what Louis could become. The great merit of Eric Singers screenplay is that he keeps the story advancing even as the worst keeps happening. Every plan our hero devises is overturned and yet each crisis presents the chance for a new plan. By the way look out for the films big shootout inside New Yorks Guggenheim Museum. Its detailed and exceptionally well executed and the setting provides an eloquent statement in itself with the high and low of human aspiration under one roof. If you want to hold on to a civilization the movie is saying this whole banking and bloodbath thing is probably not the best way to go about it. -- Advisory This film contains graphic violence and strong language.

"International The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; international-the ) International The (United States/Germany/United Kingdom 2009) February 12 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli The International possesses the look and feel of a thriller but not the heart or soul of one. With a cold clinical precision director Tom Tykwer establishes the complex narrative and weaves in a few extraneous action sequences but its an exercise in plot contortions. There are no characters to speak of - just moving pieces that go where the storyline demands and do what the storyline requires. Clive Owen normally an actor of great charisma and energy is flat. And Naomi Watts is criminally underused. She spends most of her screen time standing around playing second fiddle to Owen. In the end were left wondering why she agreed to be in the film. The premise will resonate strongly with many viewers in an era when bankers have supplanted lawyers and politicians as the most detestable individuals on the face of the planet. The cadre at the top of the control structure of the International Bank for Business and Credit (IBBC) are organizing arms deals so they can control the debt of countries in Africa and the Middle East where there are skirmishes and border wars. When someone crosses the IBBC or comes close to exposing one of their secrets that individuals life expectancy decreases dramatically. Maverick Interpol agent Louis Salinger (Clive Owen) and his bedraggled sidekick New York assistant D.A. Eleanor Whitman (Naomi Watts) are out for justice when one of their mutual colleagues is killed but they soon find themselves on the outside looking in when the IBBC exerts influence on their superiors. The story unfolds like a novel of international intrigue but theres almost too much information and exposition to convey cleanly within the confines of a two-hour motion picture. There are also a couple of extended action scenes (including a rather spectacular shoot-out at the Guggenheim Museum that is as good-looking as it is dramatically unnecessary) that appear to have been shoehorned into the movie to increase its action quotient. The ultimate pointlessness of these scenes makes them feel more like loud messy distractions. Their inclusion indicates the filmmakers tacit acceptance that the predominantly cerebral thriller is a dying breed. Its like watching something written by Len Deighton that keeps being interrupted by an episode of 24. The lead characters are as uninteresting as any I have encountered in this sort of motion picture. Much as I generally appreciate both actors I was underwhelmed by them in The International. Their characters arent merely underdeveloped - theyre undeveloped. Late in the movie when Louis is faced with a moral dilemma I discovered I had no vested interest in how he resolved the situation. It piqued my intellectual curiosity but it didnt concern me if the solution led to his death. Strangely the most interesting individual in the film is Wilhelm Wexler (veteran Armin Mueller-Stahl) an ex-Stasi colonel who gathers intelligence for the IBBC. When you look into his eyes you can see a soul - something thats not true of Louis. For a story with such complex development the ending is anticlimactic. How likely is it that with so many power brokers in play that the final act will feature a stand-off between two men? The movie fails in its resolution because it reduces all of the plotting and counter-plotting all of the influence peddling and high-level blackmail to the simplest of equations one main pointing a gun at another. For a production that aspires to be so much more than a typical thriller The International concludes on a too-familiar note. To date director Tykwer is probably best known as the architect of Run Lola Run the fast-paced high-voltage thriller that became a huge success on the art house circuit a decade ago. Little of the innovation or energy evident in Run Lola Run can be found in The International. In fact this films greatest strength lies not in its visceral action-oriented scenes but in those that hint at the kinds of international conspiracies that are easy enough to believe in todays economic climate. The main thing that keeps The International from being truly gripping is the replacement of flesh-and-blood protagonists with photogenic mannequins.

The International. (R) Columbia (118 min.) Directed by Tom Twkyer. With Clive Owen Naomi Watts. Now playing in New Jersey. TWO AND A HALF STARS. Imagine a world in which everyone and everything is controlled by international banks bloodless boardrooms happy to ruin lives and despoil entire countries if it gives them a better quarterly report. Boy its a stretch isnt it? Some movies get ahead of the zeitgeist and some capture it as its happening. ""The International"" backed into it. The movie shot at the end of 2007 and supposed to be released last year ended up being bumped into 2009. Post-financial meltdown this delayed movie seems painfully au courant. The plotting is a bit of James Bond meets the Wall Street Journal and sometimes the Journal wins. I cant say I was always able to follow which villain was which and why they were doing what to whom. Actually the chief bad guy is an institution an international bank thats gotten into arms dealing and revolution fomenting. And assassinations when people get too close. Of course eventually two more people are going to get very close -- investigating Manhattan attorney Naomi Watts and Interpol agent Clive Owen. And it will be time for a bit of exotic globe-hopping a lot of Machiavellian warnings and a gunfight in the Guggenheim. The goal is the sort of smart paranoid thriller that Hollywood has been trying to re-create since the decade of ""Three Days of the Condor"" and ""The Parallax View."" Past results havent always been smooth as scripts struggled to be complex yet clear-cut. (The flawed but earnest ""The Interpreter"" was perhaps the last serious attempt.) This screenplay is a little muddled too but at least it has a stylish director in Tom Twkyer the fast-paced phenomenon who burst on the scene with the pumped-up ""Run Lola Run"" and here sends agents chasing each other over Turkish rooftops or through German alleyways. Sometimes style trumps common sense. I never quite figured out the complications of one political assassination. And why would an organization skilled at killing people with undetectable poisons use a noisy team of men with assault rifles to handle their most important hit? Perhaps its best not to think so much and simply be swept along -- by Clive Owen (who all respect to Daniel Craig would also clearly have made a very credible 007). By Naomi Watts (good but not kept quite busy enough) and Armin Mueller-Stahl (silkily menacing as ever). And tell ourselves that the world of ""The International"" -- with its back-room dealings and diplomatic sellouts and corrupt governments and constant overpowering greed -- is in fact nothing more than a snazzy shoot-em-up with good-looking movie stars. And not the secret story of our lives. Rating note The film contains violence and strong language. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Truer words have rarely been spoken. For reasons known only to screenwriter Eric Warren Singer they order the rub-out in the middle of the Guggenheim Museum during business hours. It leaves lots of holes in the visitors and the concrete ramps not to mention the filmed art installations. This preposterous 14-minute sequence - capped by the inevitable falling chandelier - is actually the high point of this remarkably dull thriller. Mostly its a procession of eyeball-glazing head-scratching speeches and aphorisms (""sometimes the best way to find your destiny is on the path to avoiding it"") only occasionally punctuated by the odd assassination of an Italian politician. An updated riff on ""Three Days of the Condor"" with ruthless international bankers might sound timely but as the movies chief aphorism dispenser - a former Stasi agent played by Armin Mueller-Stahl - so well puts it ""Fiction has to make sense."" I spent much of the movie trying to figure out why the bank would hire a ""consultant"" (Brian F. OByrne) - with an easy-to-trace leg brace yet - to do all its assassinations. Lets hope he got a nice 401(k). And just why is naive Interpol-agent-with-a-past Clive Owen working with Naomi Watts dubiously cast as a Manhattan assistant DA? Watts who holds her trademark waterworks mostly in check for once has little to do but argue with her bosses and marvel at Owens dimpled 12 oclock shadow and apparent disinclination for hygiene. The movie meanders around the world without rhyme or reason until it gets to Turkey. There an anticlimactic rooftop chase reminds us that Tykwer the German director who reinvented the Euro thriller with ""Run Lola Run"" a decade ago has been far surpassed by Paul Greengrass and the Bourne adventures. ""The International"" which centers on a convoluted arms-supply plot is one of those movies sponsored by an international conglomerate that lectures us about how all international conglomerates are corrupt. This got me thinking Exactly how much did Sonys shareholders have to pay for that beautiful full-scale mockup of the Guggenheim they built in Berlin? Are they going to ask for a federal bailout too? lou.lumenicknypost.com THE INTERNATIONAL Kill the bankers. Running time 118 minutes. Rated R (violence profanity).

Eleanor Whitman (Naomi Watts) and Louis Salinger (Clive Owen) chase corrupt bankers in The International. Photo Jay Maidment Sony Pictures The International 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The International a timely and twisty new corporate thriller from German filmmaker Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run) is no brainless undertaking. It is in truth a highly instructive piece of cinema. My brain felt larger at the end than it did at the beginning. Whether this swelling was due to repeated assaults on my cerebral reasoning or an actual increase in hat size is a matter best left to neurologists but Im definitely a little top-heavy at the moment. Among the things I learned from The International 1. Banks are bad. 2. Bankers are evil. 3. The goal of the banking industry is to ""make us all ... slaves to debt."" (Gasp Seriously?) 4. No one wears a trench coat like Clive Owen. 5. Banks are bad. Before we go any further with this list let us pause to clarify items 1 2 3 and 5. (Item 4 is self-explanatory.) The financial institution in question is the International Bank of Business and Credit or IBBC a Luxembourg outfit known for laundering approximately all of the worlds ill-begotten money. Lately the IBBC has ventured into the weapons biz hoping to sell cheap Chinese armaments to third-world countries ripe for exploitation. A determined Interpol agent (Owen) and a nice but curiously irrelevant Manhattan prosecutor (Naomi Watts) are in hot pursuit. For reasons too convoluted to explain or in my case understand the banks scheme involves an urbane Italian defense contractor (Luca Giorgio Barbareschi) running for prime minister. For reasons less convoluted and somewhat easier to explain it also involves a cabal of high-ranking IBBC executives (Ulrich Thomsen Armin Mueller-Stahl) bent on assassinating every dumb cluck who gets in the way. Theyre quite subtle and meticulous about it -- untraceable poisons sneaky assassins that sort of thing -- until a squad of gun-wielding banker-terrorists descends on the Guggenheim Museum and riddles it with holes. A few more things I learned from The International 6.Art lovers scream like crazy while diving for cover. 7.Witnesses to wrongdoing should never and I mean never delay a conversation with the cops to wrap up a task at hand. (As in ""Well talk about that pesky international banking conspiracy right after I finish this game ofDonkey Kong aiiight?"") If they do they are Grade A certified dead meat. 8.No one wears rumpled integrity like Clive Owen. 9.No one wears a cliche like Armin Mueller-Stahl. (""Death comes for us all."" Too true.) In the Guggenheim the film drops all intellectual pretense and becomes for several brain-shrinking minutes a big stupid action vehicle. The bloody chaos interrupts whats been until then a bendy and sporadically interesting screenplay (by newcomer Eric Singer) filmed with a clean Bauhaus aesthetic by Tykwer and cinematographer Frank Griebe who last collaborated on the morbid olfactory fetishism of Perfume. The International isnt top-form Tykwer but its handsome and adamant and nows as good a time as any for some out-of-control greedy-banker-bashing. In the second half we get an earful on serious issues life destiny the failures of justice. (""Theres a difference between truth and fiction. Fiction has to make sense."" Mueller-Stahl again. Love that man.) It seems that no one -- not Interpol not some chic assistant district attorney somewhere not the combined crime-fighting forces of the civilized world -- can stop the evil that banks do. Because everyones in on it. Everyones corrupt. Money makes the world go round. Banks run everything. And as we all know ... 10.

A few months ago there might not have been an audience for a movie built around the notion. Instead it provides a timely hook for ""The International"" a satisfaction-guaranteed thriller starring Clive Owen and Naomi Watts. The title of this passport-stamping ride refers to the IBBC a financial institution overreaching its role in lethal ways. Headed by the sort of cool customer who doesnt look like a murderer the bank is into a bit of everything but particularly defense contracts. The purveyor of debt and destruction is the target of a sting that has Interpol agent Louis Salinger and Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Eleanor Whitman working together. When their colleague is killed attempting to turn a witness they are drawn deeper into concentric conspiracies. Owen makes a scruffy dogged protagonist. A former Scotland Yard man Salinger hasnt gotten used to the notion that hes an investigator. He still behaves like a cop who can bust the bad guys. Handsome more than pretty he looks appropriately exhausted and infuriated by the death of his friend. The banks ranking cabal is made up of exemplars of buttoned-down amorality. But two of the villains Salinger pursues stand out. One is a hired assassin played by Brian F. OByrne looking like Lee Harvey Oswald. The other is the man who hires him former Stasi agent Wilhelm Wexler. German actor Armin Mueller-Stahl (so chilling as the Russian mobster in ""Eastern Promises"") has a rare gift for portraying complex monsters. When Wexler says lines such as ""Character is easier kept than recovered"" they ring ugly wise quotable. Watts turn here as the dedicated assistant district attorney poses a troublesome question How is it that one of the most interesting performers of her generation isnt quite credible? One is tempted to chalk it up to Eric Warren Singers first-produced screenplay. Would a Manhattan prosecutor really find herself so deep into the far-flung action? Watts doesnt appear to believe her character would either. Influenced by the debacle of Karachi-based Bank of Credit and Commercial International the story follows the money trail of a bank with tentacles in all ports all governments. Unlike the recent James Bond installment this action movies frequent-flier miles feel integral to the action. With a vivid gaze ""The International"" touches down in a number of intriguing cities. Berlin Milan Lyon and Manhattan get their close-ups. A confrontation in the curved contours of the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Guggenheim Museum might have been action spectacle enough. Then the film jets to an Istanbul full of sun-dappled domes and minarets. German director Tom Tykwer came to the fore with his frantic sleeper hit ""Run Lola Run."" Although not a perfect adaptation of a resistant novel his English language debut ""Perfume The Story of a Murderer"" is a pungent attempt to capture what remains elusive in film -- odors. In ""The International"" hes not merely dedicated to what is seen but what is heard. ""What was that sound?"" we ask before things go awry in the opening minutes. Then we await the answer. It comes. ""The International"" supplies the twisted dealings that fulfill conspiracy hankerings. Decent cops chase down leads. Bad cops try to thwart them. The film arouses fears that we may mistake one for the other. ""The International"" is a sleek engaging example of a peculiar form of escapist entertainment a favorite in fact Its a thriller that eases us away from our present worries without fully erasing a resonance with life beyond the multiplex. Bankers exploiting international conflict and debt? Whod have thunk it?

"The International | RichardRoeper.com BLOG On Camera RR YOUTUBE CHANNEL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS Home    Movie Reviews    The International Print Page Email Page Search The International (2009; Rated ) B "" Bankers as villains? How could that be?"" -Richard Roeper MOVIE INFORMATION The International(2009; R)In theaters Friday 13 February 2009 Summary An Interpol agent attempts to expose a high-profile financial institutions role in an international arms dealing ring. Genre Action Crime Drama ThrillerDirector Tom TykwerCast Clive Owen Naomi Watts Deep into the labyrinthine plot of ""The International"" at just about the point where I was ready to rate this as a well-made but not particularly memorable thriller there is an extended shootout sequence that had me chuckling----not because its the least bit funny but because it was such a virtuoso piece of filmmaking that I wanted to stand and cheer. And I never stand and cheer at the movies because that would make me a lunatic. As hes demonstrated in films such as ""Sin City"" ""Shoot em Up"" and ""Children of Men"" nobody plays I-havent-slept-for-two-days like Clive Owen. Hes in perpetual world-weary mode here as Louis Salinger an Interpol agent in dogged pursuit of international bankers who are financing arms races in ways so complicated it would give Bernie Madoff a headache. When Salinger witnesses the murder of a colleague who was getting too close to the truth the quest becomes personal and nearly suicidal. Naomi Watts has an oddly passive role as a Manhattan district attorney who teams up with Salinger from time to time but disappears from the action for no discernible reason. Faring much better are Armin Mueller-Stahl as a German communist who long ago ransomed his own ideals in exchange for survival. And familiar character actor Brian F. OByrne is outstanding as one of the most effective and quirky assassins in recent film history. Which brings us to that shootout. Not to give too much away but a number of the films central characters wind up at New Yorks Guggenheim Museum where shots ring out for about 10 minutes in one of the best extended pieces of its kind since Michael Manns ""Heat."" (The scene was actually shot on a giant soundstage in Berlin.) Directed by Tom Tykwer (""Run Lola Run"") and shot in such exotic and visually arresting locales as Istanbuls Grand Bazaar ""The International"" reminds me of the great and greatly cynical thrillers of the 1970s such as ""The Parallax View."" And theres something almost quaint about a plot that has bankers meeting in secret place as they finance wars instead of letting down their core customers with bad business decisions.

That such a film should come out now is simultaneously fortunate and unfortunate.With banks and banking on everyones mind it could be a great thing to have a film in which just such an institution is portrayed as malevolence personified an all-powerful all-knowing organization thats got everything wired for evildoers all over the world.On the other hand banks have been revealed to be so inept so incapable of managing their own finances let alone the worlds that having them as villains at this point in time is rather like expecting Superman to be your hero and having Clark Kent show up instead.It doesnt help matters that despite glamorous stars like Clive Owen and Naomi Watts and a high-profile director like ""Run Lola Runs"" Tom Tykwer ""The International"" is never more than an adequate thriller. Its got some effective moments and aspects but the film goes in and out of plausibility and its elements never manage to unify into a coherent whole.""The International"" opens with Owen staring intently at the camera. One look at his character Interpol agent Louis Salinger lets us know that this is one heck of an angry man someone whose blood is at a perpetual boil. Just weeks after Liam Neeson pulled a similar stunt in ""Taken"" weve got another born-in-Britain individual fully capable of taking on the worst of the world. Must be something in the water.But while Neesons character worked alone Eric Warren Singers script gives Salinger a partner albeit an unlikely one. That would be svelte blond Eleanor Whitman (Watts) a Manhattan assistant district attorney who is partnering with Interpol for reasons that never feel exactly clear.If you are expecting romantic sparks to fly between these two you will be disappointed; Whitman is a happily married mother whose tolerant hunk of a husband is content to have her work crazy hours and hop a plane at a moments notice. And if youre expecting some insight into banking except for a brief exchange about the Internationals belief that ""if you control the debt you control everything"" you dont get that either.Instead the bank soon becomes the equivalent of SMERSH or Quantum -- one of those vague super-secret evil empires James Bond is always nattering on about. Not that that deters our two protagonists determined as they are to explore scenic locations like Milan and Berlin to find out what kind of nefarious scheme has got the bank wanting to buy millions of missile guidance systems.Shot by Tykwers usual cinematographer Frank Griebe ""The International"" exhibits noticeable visual style as it gallivants around the world (Istanbul Italys Lake Garda to name a few locales) and it also has some solid action sequences.Biggest of these is a huge shootout at New Yorks Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Guggenheim Museum re-created at no small expense at an abandoned railway roundhouse in Berlin. The set took 16 weeks to build and was used for six weeks of shooting. Theres no official record of the number of bullets fired but it must have been considerable.In between the shooting theres a concerted effort to make the films characters realistic to add depth to the action but except for Armin Mueller-Stahls evil henchman this doesnt happen. Emotional relevance has trouble coexisting with boilerplate lines like ""Would the Turk really play such a dangerous game?"" and ""He could be the bombshell weve spent the past two years looking for.""--Bourne to be wildDespite being structured in an intriguing way -- bits of confusing action are shown first and explained later -- ""The International"" never finds its footing. Like it or not films like this have to live in a post-""Bourne Identity"" world and since that film and its successors raised the bar for this kind of genre entertainment there is no going back.Its perhaps another sign of the times that while the Guggenheim had no qualms at all about its building being used as the setting for a graphic and bloody shootout with a high body count it was awfully fussy about what people might think of the art shown on its walls. One of the last on-screen credits reads ""The fictional exhibition depicted in the main galleries of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum was not curated by nor an actual exhibition of the Museum.""Its nice to see an institution thats got its priorities straight.--kenneth.turanlatimes.com--The InternationalMPAA rating R for some sequences of violence and languageRunning time 1 hour 58 minutesPlaying In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESSmall businesses still find big banks to be reluctant...November 16 20113 More Banks Report Russian Trading LossesAugust 29 1998Deal Would Create States 4th-Largest Bank  Finance...September 29 1995850 Jobs to Be Eliminated in Bank Merger  Finance Deal...September 29 1995Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/reviews/la-et-international13-2009feb13,0,1940894.story",200,theinternational22,theinternational,latimes

(Jay Maidment) Joe Neumaier Thursday February 12 2009 549 PM An Interpol agent tracks a corrupt bank thats buying weapons. With Clive Owens Naomi Watts. Director Tom Tykwer. (158). R Violence. At area theaters. ""The International""almost seems like a Monty Python spoof on spy-game thrillers in which the phrase ""secret agent"" is constantly replaced by ""banker"" resulting in lines like ""...If I die 100 other bankers take my place."" Sure no one likes Wall Street right now and thats actual dialogue yet its hard not to snicker when Interpol agent Lou Salinger (Clive Owen) is told that by an executive with ties to shadowy arms dealers. Working with Elly Whitman (Naomi Watts) of the New York D.As office Salinger discovers the banks goal -- control the global debt that grows from regional military conflicts -- and nabs the old man (Armin Mueller-Stahl) who pulls the strings. But as the saying goes kill one banker and another 100 are born. Every bit of plot is revealed by characters delivering exposition to another -- not exactly the height of nail-biting tension.In fact ""The International""is one of the chattiest action-dramas in recent memory. Eric Singers script may be compared to ""Michael Clayton"" though that superior examination of corporate immorality had the courage of its convictions. Owens rumpled-face-and-trenchcoat look fits well here except his laser-beam stare threatens to burn holes into Watts head. Had that happened maybe the lovely Australian actress would have stopped using a flat MCI operator voice to deliver her lines. While director Tom Tykker has calmed down since 1998s ""Run Lola Run""this movie only rouses itself for a shoot-out on the famous circular ramp in the Guggenheim museum. Still imagine how Alfred Hitchcock would have sent a canister of microfilm slowly rolling past the villains feet before trashing the art.

(Of the bunch I vote for Heaven even if the guy opposite Cate Blanchett is that genuinely annoying Giovanni Ribisi.)The International coming in the midst of our epic financial crisis should have been a winner. It wants to be a brainy thriller about the global banking industry and the sleazeball shenanigans of institutions transferring unregulated millions across cyberspace.Account balance ka-billions. Ethics and morality zip.But the clickety-clack of laptop keys and all those download bars inching across computer screens dont exactly make for adrenaline-fueled cinema. And it doesnt help to have Clive Owen - as an Interpol cop with a three-day stubble and a fixed fidgety look that crosses hangover and rage - chasing down various money men only to be told to cool his heels in the lobby. Or to go meet with some underling instead.Theres lots of imposing modern architecture in The International and scenes of Owen and Naomi Watts - as a New York assistant D.A. helping out on the case - walking to and from towering glass-and-steel edifices. (Theres only the slightest hint of romance between the two stars - Watts character is married. And its not much of a role for the actress who seems to be on hand mainly to expedite and nag.)The films big action centerpiece in fact is held in the vertiginous rotunda of Frank Lloyd Wrights Manhattan landmark the Guggenheim. Its a shoot-out that catches museumgoers in the crossfire while the art on the walls - a series of giant video installations - supply an ironic animated backdrop for the ricocheting mayhem.So yes there is gunplay (the Guggenheim firefight goes on so long you start wondering why the NYPD havent shown up). And there are car chases and foot chases and - befitting the films title - numerous sites in Berlin Istanbul London and Milan to consider.But where Run Lola Run was like a perpetual-motion machine The International seems to forever be stopping in its own tracks. Tykwer takes coffee breaks to explain the convoluted and dicey plot (sinister bankers orchestrate a political assassination in Italy in order to complete a weapons deal with a rogue African despot). The director pauses to study Owen and Watts as they text-message and check their voice mail. And then there are the occasions when Owen as temperamental agent Louis Salinger drops into his office and starts surveying the photographs and newspaper clippings hes affixed to his office wall.Riveting.Well thumb-tacking at least.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Its sins include arms trafficking financing African revolutions employing hit men to eliminate adversaries and undermining police investigations into its illegal doings. It might sound implausible but the story is based on the real-life activities of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International a 20 billion rogue holding company that serviced drug cartels underwrote Pakistans nuclear weapons program and employed a cadre of assassins and spies from the 1970s until its downfall in 1991. German director Tom Tykwer (""Run Lola Run"") keeps the stranger-than-fiction premise grounded in reality even as his spectacular Bourne-influenced action scenes test the limits of believability. The film stars Clive Owen in the kind of role he has made his trademark a grimly determined man of integrity so intense he cant pause to shave his stubble or don a properly ironed shirt. Owen plays Interpol agent Louis Salinger who has been pursuing evildoers at the International Bank of Commerce and Credit for years. His colleagues who view him as a possibly delusional maverick offer little support or assistance even when Salingers partner dies of a toxicologically suspicious ""heart attack"" immediately after interviewing an IBCC whistleblower. His staunchest ally is New York assistant district attorney Eleanor Whitman (Naomi Watts) whose career marriage and family life are in the early stages of the workaholic disintegration that turned Salinger into an obsessive loner. Tykwer has a knack for spellbinding suspense sequences and an impeccable eye for stark modernist architecture. Many of the scenes are set in sleek cold office towers chrome and glass monuments to the greatness of financial pharaohs. The film borrows a billion dollars worth of production design from monumental European megastructures and rolls out its action set piece in New York Citys Guggenheim Museum. Salinger and a couple of police detectives trail a villain (Brian F. OByrne a study in bland deadly anonymity) up Frank Lloyd Wrights famous spiral gallery. Uzis appear and suddenly art lovers are shredded into crimson-splashed action paintings. Salinger who is neither bulletproof nor fearless moves nimbly between necessary heroics and understandable cringing. The bravura 14-minute sequence goes on far beyond the point when first responders should arrive but for sheer action-film brio it stands alongside ""The French Connections"" car chase and the postrobbery street shootout in ""Heat."" Thats your moneys worth right there. The films Achilles heel is its uncertain pacing. In a bid for gravitas it putters on too long. There are repetitive scenes of the rumpled Interpol sleuth and the chic warrior prosecutor facing opposition from their superiors and superfluous passages where mean bankers and their henchmen evade Salingers eavesdropping. THE INTERNATIONAL  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for violence and language. Tykwers slow-and-suspenseful approach does yield one excellent battle of wits however. Veteran actor Armin Mueller-Stahl plays a former colonel in the East German secret police who now arranges murders for his capitalist employers. Mueller-Stahl (""Eastern Promises"") gives a carefully shaded performance as a ruthless man with long-dormant ideals. Salinger interrogates this tough old professional by triggering his conscience creating a battle of conflicting loyalties that rings true to life. A great film? No a medium film and frankly at times a disappointing one. Still ""The International"" is a film I liked enough that I wished I liked it better.

ABOUT THE MOVIEThe International  1/2 (out of four)Stars Clive Owen Naomi Watts Armin Mueller-Stahl Brian OByrne Ulrich ThomsenDirector Tom TykwerDistributor Sony Pictures EntertainmentRating R for some sequences of violence and languageRunning time 1 hour 57 minutesOpens today nationwide  WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY By portraying bankers as the ultimate villains the stylish espionage thriller The International gets high marks for timeliness. Its a well-made and handsome drama centering on a powerful and corrupt European bank with ties to arms dealers. Clive Owen does a fine job as Louis Salinger an Interpol agent bent on toppling the bank and exposing its nefarious operations. Though not as action-packed as some thrillers The International is noteworthy for its unusually scenic and architecturally dazzling locations. A key scene in Istanbul around a mosque and across rooftops is a highlight. But the most captivating sequence is a lengthy shoot-out at a most unexpected New York cultural institution. Director Tom Tykwer uses architecture and design in unusual and startling ways making for a sleek-looking tale. But there are convoluted patches within this complex conspiracy scenario. Salinger teams with Eleanor Whitman (Naomi Watts) a Manhattan assistant district attorney. Watts is not given much to do and disappears for the last quarter of the film. The movies credibility hinges on Owens performance. With his virile good looks and knowing manner he makes the character believable even if his back story needs more filling in. Together Salinger and Whitman uncover the Luxembourg-based banks connection to an Italian arms dealer and additional illicit goings-on. The concept of bankers as ruthless evildoers resonates in these days of economic crisis. And rather than hitting the usual world capitals the plot spins from Berlin Luxembourg Milan and Italys Lake Garda region to New York and finally Istanbul. The pace bogs down as the thriller veers toward police procedural turf. The bulk of the action occurs during a 15-minute burst of bullet-riddled activity that is exciting and visually arresting -- and bloody. Tykwer brings some of the visual panache he exhibited in 1998s adrenaline-fueled Run Lola Run. The dialogue by screenwriter Eric Warren Singer is spotty. There are some great pithy lines and others whose attempt at profundity ring false. Armin Mueller-Stahl plays a consultant/fixer to the bank who conveys the upper echelons orders to a hired assassin. Owen and Mueller-Stahl are enjoyable to watch as they face off. But their scenes together are hampered by occasional speechifying. Each character seems as if hes trying to one-up the other by speaking in maxims and quasi-sermonettes. Some dialogue is distinctive and clever In an early scene when one of the villains is told to relax he snarls ""Im more comfortable tense."" While not as dynamic as the Bourne films -- the gold standard for thrillers --The International is comfortably tense and visually stunning.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet After the singularly overreaching mindfuck of Perfume The Story Of A Murderer it was perhaps inevitable that graying Run Lola Run wunderkind Tom Twyker would follow up with something less personal and ambitious. Sure enough The International follows in the footsteps of the recent Bond reboot and the Bourne movies with a slick accomplished globe-trotting thriller about nefarious deeds in high places. The International has a top-flight international cast headlined by the high-wattage duo of Clive Owen and Naomi Watts. Its premise aches with timely resonance. Its directed with meticulous artistry. So why does it ultimately feel so empty and forgettable? Owen lends his sad eyes and haunted intensity to the role of an Interpol agent investigating a sprawling enormously powerful bank out to make a killing in more than just the financial market. As he gets closer to the truth about an international dynamo with sidelines in money laundering powerful weapons and destabilizing regimes in Third World countries bodies pile up and the scope of the banks dirty dealings begins to crystallize. Naomi Watts has a perversely thankless role as a Manhattan assistant D.A. who aids Owen in his quest to uncover the truth. Its hard to imagine a better time to release a thriller about an evil bank--public faith in financial institutions is at an all-time low and bank executives are regularly vilified for chicanery that makes mean old Mr. Potter look downright benign by comparison. But in The International the sneering bank baddies are frustratingly generic; theyre really no different from the evil law firms of John Grisham novels or the arms and drug dealers of countless action-thrillers. As an exemplar of pure craft The International has much to recommend it like a stunning setpiece that finds Owen shooting it out with the villains at the Guggenheim museum and a touching supporting turn from Armin Mueller-Stahl. Yet even Twykers weakest films have a sense of personality thats largely missing from The International. Hes such a consummate auteur that its a little disconcerting to see him playing the role of craftsman for hire.

Two-thirds of the way into ""The International"" comes an action sequence so audacious so supremely well crafted that I dont want to tell you anything more about it. Ill have to in a bit but if you want to retain a moviegoers constitutional right to be surprised just stop reading and go. I can promise you a fairly good thriller with mixed-bag elements preposterous plot smartly elegant direction one of the worst recent performances by a major actress and a dynamite stick of an action scene that can stand close to the greats (the car chase in ""The French Connection"" the single-take battle sequence in ""Children of Men"") and from which the movie never really recovers.By the way how up-to-the-nanosecond is ""The International""? The bad guy is a bank. When the nefarious conspiracy behind all the hugger-mugger is finally laid out a character says ""Its not about profit its about control. . . . This is the essence of banking to make us slaves of debt."" Finally a villain we can all agree on. Audiences loosen your shackles - you have nothing to lose but your credit rating.Based loosely on the BCCI scandal of 1991 ""The International"" concerns a Luxembourg-based financial entity called the International Bank of Business and Credit run by an unflappable Euro-smoothie named Skarssen (Ulrich Thomsen of ""The Celebration""). The IBBC is the favored lender of African warlords and Chinese small-arms merchants and our heroes - a manly Interpol agent (ex-Scotland Yard) named Louis Salinger (Clive Owen who has yet to crack a smile on film and good for him) and Ellie Whitman (Naomi Watts) of the Manhattan DAs office - want to bring the bank down. Shes the good cop hes the bad cop and the movie knows better than to gin up a romance between these two.In general the movie knows better period. The genre is the high-stakes globe-hopping thriller as most recently purveyed by the ""Bourne"" movies but director Tom Tykwer is confident enough to go his own way. There are datelines and foreign capitals (full of foreign capital) but not for this filmmaker the handheld jiggery-pokery of ""Bourne"" director Paul Greengrass or even of Tykwers own breakthrough 1998s ""Run Lola Run."" ""The International"" is less ambitious but more successful than Tykwers last movie ""Perfume"" (2006); its little more than a potboiler but it makes you realize how rare it is these days to be in the hands of a natural-born moviemaker.For instance Early on Salinger and Whitman have traced the money trail to an Italian arms manufacturer whos running for prime minister (Luca Giorgio Barbareschi) and he promises to tell them everything right after hes delivered a campaign speech in a public square. We all know whats going to happen but the shock lies in how it happens and the pleasure is in the cleanly photographed crisply edited shot language keeping us one step ahead of the heroes and two behind Eric Warren Singers script. Heres another Salinger has chased an IBBC hit man in and out of alleys and at a certain point hes on foot and the villain is in a car. The hero rounds a corner to find . . . a traffic jam of identical black automobiles. Its not a new idea but Tykwer and his cinematographer Frank Griebe frame it so its newly seen and I suddenly realized where the film was going Its the umbrella scene from Hitchcocks ""Foreign Correspondent"" with a double shot of corporate paranoia.That hit man by the way is one of the best things in the movie a spook played with eerily capable blandness by the Irish actor Brian F. OByrne. His character has the sort of anonymous uninflected face you wouldnt notice in a subway car and thats his armor Hes a lethal nonentity. ""The International"" sets him and Salinger on a collision course - Whitman and a variety of foreign and New York City cops get involved but for the longest time the movies dance is between these two. When they finally cross paths Tykwer shifts gears and suddenly were in an unexpected and better movie.That would be the action scene I mentioned earlier - last chance to stop reading - and again theres a jolt of Hitchcock in the use of a well-known landmark for movie mayhem. Salinger has followed his quarry to Manhattans Guggenheim Museum where a major showdown ensues and the sequence is an absolute kick in its use of architectural and cinematic space. The people were rooting for have to get all the way down the Guggenheims famous spiral ramp with heavy ordnance coming at them from all directions.The scene keeps thrillingly one-upping itself yet it plays with a realism you dont see in say a ""Die Hard"" movie. Museum patrons scatter and blubber believably; the stunt-Guggenheim takes a beating; later the incident is all over the news as it would and should be. What makes the sequence even more satisfying is that the action has narrative twists threading through it with allegiances shifting and alliances forged under heavy fire.After that? ""The International"" gets back to the business at hand though its energy is spent and the holes in the byzantine plot keep stretching wider. Were treated to a good and weary performance by Armin Mueller-Stahl for once not playing the avuncular villain but the villains avuncular advisor and were forced to wonder why Watts an extremely skilled player in the right circumstances cant deliver action-movie dialogue without sounding like a third-rate TV actress. I guess its not in her skill set.Big twisty fundamentally empty Euro-thrillers are in Tom Tykwers skill set surprisingly - who knew? The director has struggled to find the right projects in the decade since ""Run Lola Run"" but ""The International"" is a reminder that his gifts are many and prodigious. Well be hearing from him again. You can bank on it.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2013 Globe Newspaper Company.

A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Tom Tykwers The International is one of those movies in which shadowy men meet in parked cars abandoned buildings and inconspicuous public spaces (museum galleries are a particular favorite) travel under assumed names and always glance nervously over their shoulders fearful of being spied on through a snipers lens. Some come to give information others to glean it. All tread carefully around potentially bugged telephones possibly sabotaged automobiles or any stranger passing too closely in the street lest one feel a slight prick of the skin and moments later keel over from a quick-acting poison. What might you ask is the cause of all this cloak-and-dagger skullduggery? Well I could tell you but then Id have to bore you.As generic as its title The International unfolds in a half-dozen countries with a conspiratorial plot that implicates most of the civilized world as yet another dogged believer in justice-for-all seeks to expose the infernal machinations of a seemingly untouchable conglomerate. That the capitalist bogeyman this time is a Luxembourg bank with a brisk sideline in political assassinations and Third World arms dealing hardly matters. We could just as soon be talking about The Parallax Views nefarious Parallax Corporation or the CIA of Three Days of the Condor to mention but two of the 1970s paranoia thrillers after which Tykwers film slavishly patterns itself.Only nobody in those films -- not even Robert Redfords nerdy Condor researcher -- seemed quite as dense as Louis Salinger (Clive Owen) the bedraggled Interpol agent who walks through the entirety of The International looking downright aghast at the ends to which men will go in the pursuit of money and power. Who knew? Salinger carries the troubled past required of all conspiracy-movie heroes (the better for Big Brother to discredit them when the time comes) so evidenced by his perpetual bed-head and stubble and propensity for engaging in self-righteous shouting matches with his superiors which reliably end with someone reminding him that hes ""not at Scotland Yard anymore."" Likewise we know hes found a kindred spirit in the equally idealistic Manhattan assistant district attorney Eleanor Whitman (Naomi Watts) as soon as we see her lecturing her own jaded boss on the importance of truth and responsibility. Both actors seem mildly aggrieved (and not at all convincing) at having to play characters considerably less intelligent than themselves in a movie that plays even dumber.If theres one thing that Tykwer -- whose career has traced a generally downward trajectory in the decade since the effectively gimmicky Run Lola Run -- knows about its perpetual motion. So round and round The International goes -- from Berlin to Luxembourg Milan and New York -- while Salinger and Whitman pursue an elusive hired gun (Brian F. OByrne) who may be the key to proving their case dodging the requisite bullets and tinted sedans en route to the startling revelation that sometimes one has to bend the law in order to enforce it.

Sep. 13 600pm Around the time you begin to wonder if Owen and Watts achieved platinum frequent-flyer status while filming they corner the hitman and his ex-Stasi handler (Armin Mueller-Stahl) in of all places Manhattans Guggenheim Museum whereupon The International devolves into an orgy of destruction that should appease anyone who has ever wondered what a Michael Bay installation might look like. Given its biggest role in a film since Matthew Barneys Cremaster 3 Frank Lloyd Wrights iconic six-story spiral (actually an elaborate and highly convincing replica built on a German soundstage) is swarmed by UZI-wielding baddies who fire thousands of rounds into conceptual-art pieces and museum-goers alike providing The International with a working metaphor for its own shotgun wedding of grindhouse inclinations and art-house ambitions.The first produced script by screenwriter Eric Warren Singer The International takes its inspiration from the 1991 scandal surrounding the Pakistani-run Bank of Credit and Commerce International which counted Saddam Hussein and Manuel Noriega among its clients and turned out to be one of the biggest Ponzi schemes of the pre-Madoff era. The movie never comes close though to the genuinely unsettling tenor of such recent corporate cautionary tales as Time Out Michael Clayton and French director Nicolas Klotzs tragically underseen Heartbeat Detector which variously suggested how an ordinary man or woman might lose his or her soul to the New Economy and how a multinationals perfectly legal fiscal policy could be far more sinister than any overtly illicit activity.""Fiction has to make sense"" Mueller-Stahl asserts during a third-act interrogation scene before pointing out that real life abides by no such rules of order. Yet for all its ripped-from-the-headlines sleight of hand The International traffics in the most reductive of fiction conventions feigning world-weary cynicism while laboring toward an ending that offers both reasonable closure and faith in the ability of good to trump evil. Here is a movie for a time when such clear convictions could be taken to the bank released into a world where they are no longer worth the celluloid theyre printed on.THE INTERNATIONAL | Directed by TOM TYKWER | Written by ERIC WARREN SINGER | Produced by CHARLES ROVEN RICHARD SUCKLE and LLOYD PHILLIPS | Released by Columbia Pictures | Citywide Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

But its especially notable for the introduction of a new villain one that will doubtless make many appearances in the near future Debt. In this case its not credit-card problems or overdue payments on the utility bill. Were talking global debt that virtually enslaves nations but which must be maintained to keep ruthless banks in business. This is a world most of us dont know one of extraordinarily high stakes involving arms dealing and money laundering and such one where if you run afoul of the bank they dont ding you with late fees. They kill you. The International is both compelling and given the state of the economy more than a little scary (the films official Web site is everybodypays .com). Clive Owen plays Louis Salinger an Interpol agent teaming with the Manhattan District Attorneys Office represented by Eleanor Whitman (Naomi Watts). Theyre investigating and trying to bring down the International Bank of Business and Credit which has its tentacles in all manner of shady global operations. Salinger and Whitmans investigation takes them all over the world including Berlin Istanbul Turkey and Milan Italy in addition to New York. The body count piles up including an assassination that director Tom Tykwer telegraphs too strongly (though to his credit the real intrigue is in the setup and aftermath). The pace is fast and the action particularly a mind-boggling shoot-em-up in the Guggenheim Museum furious enough. But the less-conventional elements are in many ways even more effective. Patrick Baladis performance as Douglas White an attorney for the IBBC is chilling. His words his manner his bearing all imply what everyone knows already Sure the bank is breaking the law and theres nothing Salinger or anyone else can do about it. Whites not so much smug as just confident as befits a man with the backing of a well-funded killing machine. Salinger however is a tough case. A hothead whose temper has already gotten him into trouble hes so single-minded of purpose that it appears he doesnt shower for the entire film. He is willing to get by on brawn when brains arent enough. In fact while trying to piece together the details of a shooting he utters the one line you almost never hear from an investigator in this kind of film ""I dont know."" Owen is a compelling screen presence; he makes Salinger imperfect in some ways doing what Daniel Craig has done with his reinterpretation of James Bond. Yet Salingers flaws and his inability to save the day at every turn make him more interesting not less. Watts on the other hand doesnt do much with what is admittedly a thankless role. There are bad guys aplenty including a brain trust of advisers who report to the head of IBBC (Ulrich Thomsen) who treats the fortunes of other nations and their people as if they were no more important than the games he plays with his son. Granted the strength of banks isnt what it once was and dwindles by the day. But that cavalier attitude the casual way in which lives are rendered unimportant when they get in the way of making a buck (or billions of bucks) is whats so disturbing and what makes the audiences investment in Salingers case so complete. Do things like this really go on with international banks? One cant help but wonder - and one cant help but hope there are agents like Salinger out there on the case.

OByrne; Director Tom Tykwer; Author Eric Singer; Release Date Wide 02/13/2009; Runtime (in minutes) 116; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Columbia Pictures Posted February 11 2009 -- 1200 AM EST Arriving at a time when the banking industry already has a lot of splainin to do theres something almost endearingly out of sync about the sleek but now dated Euro-thriller The International. Clive Owen plays a rogue Interpol agent who (with the low-energy help of Naomi Watts as a Manhattan assistant district attorney) pursues justice against a globally powerful bank that finances terror around the world. As a result Owens grim cop with burning eyes (another hollow fellow from the Children of Men school of despair) zips around the world too -- the production budget mustve been rich -- on the trail of men who behave badly in impersonal offices of painfully minimalist design. Bra i]an F. OByrne and Armin Mueller-Stahl are dependably good as shady players. But the star of the pic may well be NYCs Guggenheim Museum and Istanbuls Grand Bazaar both of which figure in cool action chase sequences that pay handsome dividends. B?

"Movie review The International -- 3 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review The International -- 3 out of 5 stars Clive Owen Sony Clive Owen Clive Owen (Sony) Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Eleven years ago Tom Tykwer was the hot new German director of Run Lola Run an amped-up action film that began at a sprint and never once slowed to a trot as it followed a woman dashing from place to place trying to raise the cash to save her lover. That was the movie that raised the bar on chases and action films.Now Tykwer brings us The International a movie that seems downright quaint in this new Bourne era. Its about 500 edits from hurtling across the screen the way your typical thriller (see Taken) does these days. A slower pace makes for more character development and time to ponder whats happening. But whiplash cross-cutting can hide a world of script sins such as the wacky turns Eric Singers screenplay takes in the third act of this film. Though well-acted with a bang-up shoot-out staged at New Yorks Guggenheim Museum International feels like decaf compared to the caffeine jag that is the new action state-of-the-art. Clive Owen and Naomi Watts are Salinger and Whitman an Interpol agent and a New York district attorney working together to catch a Luxembourg bank in the act of laundering mob and terrorist money. Lou Salinger has been obsessed with the IBBC (bank) since his days at Scotland Yard. The fact that he can no longer arrest or shoot anybody (Interpol policy) irks him no end as he knows and we see this bank ""remove"" problem employees obstacles in the way of deals.The films messages sting that there are multi-national institutions that are above any one nations laws that governments will look the other way in the interest of commerce that banks dont want cash as much as they want to own debt from China Middle Eastern terror groups developing world revolutionaries and you and me. The misbehavior of bankers worldwide makes this movie as timely as a CNN ticker. Every time Salinger and Whitman get close to wrong-doing co-opted cops bank spies (led by Armin Mueller-Stahl) and hired assassins get in the way.""Is there anything else we can do to you Agent Salinger?"" one of the smug big-wigs smirks after a failed interrogation.But big banks make big boo-boos and they go too far with one assassination. Salinger and Whitman call in favors and try to track the hired gun back to the folks who sign his checks. Tykwer stages some nice slices of C.S.I. detective work pushing toward a not-nearly-the-end bloodbath in one of New Yorks most famous art landmarks.Owen is properly menacing and obsessed. Watts seems an after-thought here. We meet her characters family but they arent put in peril by the evil bank or its henchmen. The villains are fairly nondescript and youll either buy into the third act twists or strain your neck from shaking your head. But The International still manages intrigue and surprise even if it doesnt have that jolt that Jason Bourne and James Bond have led us to expect from our thrillers. Its a film that mad as it sometimes seems gives you things to chew on.The titles a pun by the way to those who remember their history of communism. It takes guts to remember the totalitarianism that was and the totalitarianism that replaced it and think theres a thriller in it.

"The International | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Review The International Todd McCarthy 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr February 5 2009 | 1240PM PT ""The International"" is a mostly ho-hum globe-hopping thriller. While prescient or just lucky to have made bankers its bad guys ""The International"" is a mostly ho-hum globe-hopping thriller that gives the audience too little investment in its protagonists and central conflict. Graced with well-chosen location eye candy Tom Tykwers biggest production to date is proficient but lacks the added tension and characterization to put it anywhere near the top tier of contempo action suspensers. With its very Euro feel this Sony release probably will perform better overseas than Stateside where outlook is just OK. Pic kicked off the Berlin Film Festival on Feb. 5. Eleven years after raising the bar for arresting hyperkinetic commercial filmmaking with ""Run Lola Run"" Tykwer has found himself bettered at his own game by the likes of Paul Greengrass Danny Boyle Doug Liman and Martin Campbell among others. ""The International"" scampers all over the place but its alternately frantic and a little slack with a hole in the middle where some interesting characters ought to be. First-time screenwriter Eric Warren Singer based his script on the Bank of Credit and Commercial Intl. a Pakistan-born institution that specialized in money laundering arms dealing and financing rebel armies mercenaries and terrorists from the 1970s until its demise in 1991. The fictional bank in question here the IBBC has a formidable ultra-sleek HQ in Luxembourg and seems to function equally as an assassination bureau and a broker for weapons sales among unsavory parties. Having witnessed a colleague drop dead in Berlin after nearly uncorking a deal for a sophisticated missile guidance system between the Chinese and some undesirables it falls to sweaty grubby pushy Interpol agent Louis Salinger (Clive Owen) formerly of Scotland Yard to finger the bad boys who are all well-groomed overly serious Euros expert at hard stares and putting on airs of steely superiority. For reasons glided over too quickly to sink in Salinger is paired with New York Assistant District Attorney Eleanor Whitman (Naomi Watts) to pursue their suspicions. European officials suddenly become extremely uncooperative when they find out who the pair is investigating even after another high-profile murder and a political assassination in Milan bear the IBBC signature. Nearly an hour in the action shifts to New York City for the sole purpose of staging the films major violent setpiece on the curving ramps of the Guggenheim Museum. After a wildly coincidental chance sighting of the assassin cutely known only as the Consultant (Brian F. OByrne) Frank Lloyd Wrights Upper East Side masterpiece is turned into a war zone as it gets shot to pieces by philistines wielding very heavy artillery. Taking performance art to new levels of mayhem Tykwer moves his shooters amid ever-changing wall video installations as they maneuver up down and around the gallery and leave a terrible case of pock marks in their wake. As orchestrated chaos ensues for 14 minutes you mostly wonder how the sequence was filmed if a combination of the real place and sets was used and why the Guggenheim would have allowed it. The answer is that except for some establishing shots the sequence was entirely staged on a massive utterly credible re-creation in an old railway roundhouse in Berlin. The fact that one sits there contemplating logistics more than story suggests somethings missing. Owens Salinger is clearly designed to be the counterhero a scruffy stubbly ornery maverick whos let the rest of his life slide in his often bumpy pursuit of justice. The basic notion behind the character is fine but insufficient psychological detail is provided to back up the exterior sketch; one need only compare him to a similarly driven and prickly detective such as Gene Hackmans Popeye Doyle in ""The French Connection"" to be aware of the depth thats wanting here. Salingers spirited tag-along crimefighter Whitman is one of the few roles to which Watts hasnt been able to bring anything special because theres nothing remotely suggested about her inner-life or past. By contrast Armin Mueller-Stahls titan of corruption at the center of IBBC has been loaded with a ripe former career to help explain his malfeasance just the latest example of how much more interesting it can be to play complicated bad guys rather than one-dimensional good ones. Scripter Singer latched onto a good subject for a thriller but paid more attention to connecting the dramatic dots than to delving beneath the surface of international business or personality. Dialogue is generally mundane with functional intent. Textured lensing by Tykwer regular Frank Griebe captures the visual qualities of the diverse locations which also include Lyon and in the scenic finale Istanbul where effective use is made of rooftop vistas as well as the Suleymaniye Mosque and an underground Byzantine cistern. Other production values are fine and the score by Tykwer Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heil throbs in relatively discreet fashion.
