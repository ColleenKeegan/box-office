Like many tweenie protagonists before them the young teenagers find their lives enriched by their secret and become empowered by proxy. While Aqua can teach them a thing or two about confidence the girls can school her in the ways of love - but not necessarily the boy-girl romance she desires. As a sweet little message-driven story about female friendship this girly comedy (based on Alice Hoffmans novel) has some appeal. Unfortunately the performances are often clunky and the art direction and CG are wanting so anyone over the age of eight is likely to find it cheap around the edges. One for very little mermaids.

CR VINCE VALITUTTI / 20th Century Fox Photo VINCE VALITUTTI / 20th Century F She came from the deep -- and needs help with a date 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Aquamarine Romantic comedy. Starring Emma Roberts Joanna ""Jojo"" Levesque and Sara Paxton. Directed by Elizabeth Allen. (PG. 103 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Aquamarine"" smartly circumvents the inherent problem of making a movie geared to preteen girls. Doubtless they already have boys on the brain causing sensations in other parts of their anatomy. But it would be unseemly not to mention R rated to show serious smooching at such a tender age. Instead ""Aquamarines"" barely pubescent heroines Claire (Emma Roberts niece of Julia) and Hailey (newcomer Joanna ""Jojo"" Levesque who would be well advised to lose the nickname) facilitate a romance between a new 18-year-old pal and a lifeguard the two have a serious crush on but are willing to sacrifice in the interest of friendship. The ingeniousness of this plot device is that it allows young girls in the audience to fulfill their romantic fantasies along with the matchmakers. The movie has a sweetness and innocence that makes it near perfect entertainment for its target audience. Parents dont have to worry that their daughters will come away with any ideas they didnt come in with. At the same time ""Aquamarine"" avoids seeming coy and doesnt flinch from taking on serious issues that illustrate that life isnt all fluff even for the young. Hailey is from a broken home and her longing for her father is palpable when she holds up a framed photo of her family pre-divorce. The untimely deaths of Claires parents have caused her to withdraw from life and cling to Hailey. Claire is distraught because Hailey not only her best friend but her only friend is about to move away from their small Florida town. Claires circle broadens when she spots something fishy floating around in a pool. It turns out to be a mermaid (Sara Paxton) naturally named Aquamarine. For those slightly older ""Splash"" will forever be the definitive mermaid movie. Paxton is pretty enough in a bland blond sort of way and she flaps around admirably but shes no Daryl Hannah when it comes to conveying confusion at the habits of land creatures. A scene where Aqua tickles herself with cotton candy because she cant comprehend its for eating doesnt come close to provoking the laughter of Hannahs mermaid taking a big bite out of a whole lobster creating a loud crunching sound that prompts stares from fellow diners. But seasoned screenwriters Jessica Bendinger (""Sex and the City"" ""First Daughter"") and John Quaintance (""Material Girls"") adapting Alice Hoffmans novel are on to something when they mate a mermaid with a lifeguard. Who would better understand the lure of the deep even if it does take him a while to catch on to why Aqua does a vanishing act at sunset? In the mythology of mermaids or at least of this mermaid she sprouts legs only in daytime. Bendinger and Quaintance also provide some very funny girl talk between Claire and Hailey distilled from the teen magazines the girls devour as gospel on how to attract the opposite sex. Emma Roberts has the potential to be the next Julia Roberts. Shes got her aunts winning smile and is always the one you want to look at no matter whom she shares the screen with. Emma is especially good at showing Claires vulnerability. The sadness is there even when shes frolicking with Hailey and their new best friend. The three go shopping at a mall in Tampa for something to wear to an end-of-summer bash. Aqua who is shown mostly in a borrowed T-shirt (aqua blue of course) when shes not naked in the water is in particular need of threads. Director Elizabeth Allen shoots them trying on vintage clothes in fast motion. The action slows to allow them to admire one anothers getups indicating that Allen clearly understands shopping as a bonding experience. Being a woman helps. It also helps Allen bring so much veracity to a movie that is at its heart not about snagging a boyfriend but about the value of having close girlfriends. -- Advisory This film contains mild sexual references.

""Aquamarine"" presents its young audience with a charming quandary Whats a girl to do when she finds a mermaid in her beach-club swimming pool? The sea maiden (Sara Paxton) whose name is Aquamarine looks like a supermodel sports cute blue highlights in her long blond hair (which as luck and a PG rating would have it just happens to cover her bare chest) and has a nice mastery of sarcasm. Shes a reality show waiting to happen and the 13-year-old pals who find her Claire (Emma Roberts) and Hailey (Joanna ""JoJo"" Levesque) stare at her in fascination. Summer vacation just got a lot more exciting. Based on a short story of the same name by Alice Hoffman (""Practical Magic"") this sparkly fairy tale wont hold much interest for those outside the tween-girl demographic. Its screenplay too often seems to be treading water and the directing (by first-timer Elizabeth Allen) is undistinguished relying too often on squeals from the ever-excitable Claire and Hailey for drama. But it takes a surprising turn in its final act as the girls learn a lesson about friendship and love. As one of the characters tells us love is the closest thing we have to magic -- and thats a sweet message for any age. Movie review Showtimes and trailer""Aquamarine"" with Emma Roberts Joanna ""JoJo"" Levesque Sara Paxton Jake McDorman Arielle Kebbel. Directed by Elizabeth Allen from a screenplay by John Quaintance and Jessica Bendinger based on a short story by Alice Hoffman. 103 minutes. Rated PG for mild language and sensuality. Several theaters. Grown-up girls may find Claire and Hailey familiar and poignant as they spend their 13-year-old summer wanting desperately to be older. (Theyre still little girls at heart though and perfectly innocent -- this movies aimed squarely at preteens.) They study magazines looking for advice that will make Raymond (Jake McDorman) the adorable lifeguard at the beach notice them. As they school Aquamarine a tad cluelessly on how to catch a boys eye we learn techniques like ""the laugh and pass"" (which seems to work but isnt anywhere near as good as Elle Woods ""bend and snap"" in ""Legally Blonde""). Paxton brings a funny screechiness to her character and Roberts (Julias niece proving that big eyes run in the family) and Levesque are alternately earnest and giggly as needed. Girls enchanted by mermaids will enjoy the details starfish earrings that whisper compliments to the wearer; fingernail polish that changes like mood rings; shells that act as cellphones to the sea. ""Aquamarine"" isnt good enough to be a teen classic but its audience will leave the theater happy -- and while thats not quite as rare as mermaids its still something to celebrate.

"She lives in the sea but still needs a hunk - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW She lives in the sea but still needs a hunk By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  March 3 2006 Im not a lust-ridden tween-age girl but if I were and a mermaid happened to find her way into my swimming pool the last thing Id do is take her shopping and let her steal the boy of my dreams. But Im catty and shallow. The two best friends in Aquamarine"" are sweet and fair. So when the bubbly Aquamarine (Sara Paxton) winds up in a Florida beach town after a storm Claire (Emma Roberts whos Erics daughter and Julias niece) and Hailey (the pop singer known as JoJo) try to give her what she wants. Love. Of course at sundown Aquas legs turn back into a tail which means she doesnt have much time to find it.According to Aqua her father plans to marry her off to a merman she doesnt love. Dad doesnt believe love exists. She insists it does and daddy gives her three days to prove it. The boy she picks is Raymond (Jake McDorman) the same permanently shirtless lifeguard Hailey and Claire have been wanting all summer. But if they help a mermaid they get a wish and since Hailey is about to move to Australia they enlist in Project Love and plan to use their wish to stay together.If I were these two Id be wishing for filmmaking better than the ABC Family Channel stuff theyve got. But 12-year-old girls wont care that some of the overdubbed dialogue in Aquamarine"" makes it seem like a lesser work of Italian neorealism. (The ones who do should write me. I might know some 13-year-old nerds whod love to watch Open City"" with you.)Most girls will just be pleased that Alice Hoffmans book has been faithfully adapted that Roberts has inherited the familys good dental work that Paxton is like Reese Witherspoon with a tail and that JoJo is playing someone other than the underage vixen she does in her PG music videos. The town vamp is Cecilia (Arielle Kebbel) the dangerously tan Mandy Moore-monster who is also in pursuit of Raymond. (Hes the only boy in town worth wanting.) Girls will hate her but if the intended audience is anything like Claire and Hailey they will come to feel sorry for her too.Aquamarine"" is part Splash"" and part Clueless"" (when that dressing-room montage comes hurtling toward you duck).

The high-concept premise -- two adolescent girls befriend a temporarily beached mermaid -- has been fleshed out with inventive wit unsticky warmth and more than a little wackiness. Sweet and sprightly in just the right measures ""Aquamarine"" is one of the seasons pleasant surprises. The high-concept premise -- two adolescent girls befriend a temporarily beached mermaid -- has been fleshed out with inventive wit unsticky warmth and more than a little wackiness. Result is an unusually likeable family-friendly comedy that could appeal far beyond its target demo of tweener femmes and net a wider audience. Looking downstream pic likely will make an even bigger splash on homevid. Working from a novel by Alice Hoffman (""Practical Magic"") scripters John Quaintance and Jessica Bendinger begin their fish-out-of-water scenario by introing 13-year-old best buddies Claire (Emma Roberts of Nickelodeons ""Unfabulous"") and Hailey (Joanne ""JoJo"" Levesque) at summers end less than a week before they will be forced to separate. Claires marine-biologist mom has landed a plum assignment in Australia -- far far away from their current home in a Florida coastal community where Haileys grandparents operate an invitingly retro beach club. Nearly friendless except for each other the girls literally pray for a miracle to keep them together. Fortuitously their prayers appear to be answered when a tidal wave triggered by a sudden storm washes a mermaid into the beach clubs swimming pool. Aquamarine (Sara Paxton of NBCs ""Darcys Wild Life"") is a blonde beautiful and bubbly 18-year-old who wants to learn about the habits of surface dwellers. Shes especially eager to know about love a state of grace that her father insists is entirely mythical. If she cant make Dad see love is real Aquamarine will be forced into arranged marriage a few days hence with an unappealing merman. Hence theres an understandable urgency to her trolling for a desirable human who might prove her right and pledge his troth. Much like the finny femme played so memorably by Daryl Hannah in Ron Howards ""Splash"" (1984) Aquamarine is quite capable of sprouting lovely legs to replace her scaly tail. (If she gets wet however or stays out past sunset the tail returns.) But when it comes to mastering the finer points of reeling in a man the mermaid is out at sea. Not to worry though Claire and Hailey are willing to share all theyve learned about flirty behavior and feminine wiles from the pages of glossy teen-skewing magazines. First-time feature helmer Elizabeth Allen demonstrates a light touch and savvy comic chops while smoothly steering the plot toward a beat-the-clock set-up. If Claire and Hailey can help Aquamarine woo a hunky lifeguard (Jake McDorman) -- and get him to say ""I love you"" -- the mermaid will grant the girls a wish. Trouble is time is of the essence. Worse theres an unscrupulous cutie (Arielle Kebbel) who also longs for the lifeguard. A few early scenes in ""Aquamarine"" percolate a tad too insistently with the aggressive quick-cut style of music videos designed to showcase trendy pop tarts. But gradually almost imperceptibly pic slows its pace to allow more time for involving character development and gently amusing interaction. Roberts and Levesque -- who look like real-world 13-year-olds -- develop a credible and compelling relationship with each other particularly in scenes that touch on the orphaned Haileys fear of water. Just as important they provide pitch-perfect reactions as straight women to Paxton whos by turns impish anxious and ebullient as Aquamarine acclimates herself to the joys and mysteries of life on dry land. Paxtons impressive talent for physical comedy serves her character and pic as a whole very well. A large part of pics charm stems from its relatively daring approach to wrapping up various plot threads in the final reel as filmmakers take an unexpected (and wholly satisfying) turn toward something like realism. Without getting too heavy-handed with moralizing or message-mongering filmmakers suggest that gaining maturity and self-awareness may be more important than fantasy-fulfilling happily-ever-aftering. Supporting players -- including Bruce Spence as a maintenance worker whose spookiness is more apparent than real -- are first-rate across the board. Australia doubles capably for plots Florida setting. And speaking of trickery The wizards of the Gold Coast-based JMB FX Studios work seamless magic while sustaining the illusion of Aquamarines mermaidenhood. Other standout tech contributions include Nelson Coates evocative production design Brian Brehenys handsome lensing and Sally Sharpes aptly colorful costumes.

She is discovered there by Hailey (Joanna Levesque) and Claire (Emma Roberts of Nickelodeons ""Unfabulous"") junior high school-age pals who have been spending the final days of summer alternately staring at Raymond the lifeguard (Jake McDorman) and moaning over the fact that Hailey is about to move away. When Aquamarine herself gets a crush on Raymond and lets on that she has the power to grant wishes a conspiracy is formed.Ms. Paxton isnt quite as magnetic as a movie mermaid ought to be but the two buddies are a treat to watch especially Ms. Roberts showing the genes of her Aunt Julia.Safety-conscious parents may be appalled at the goings-on -- salt is guzzled right from the box a rickety water tower is climbed stormy seas are plunged into by people who can barely swim -- but their children will be having a fine time. And the story (based on the book by Alice Hoffman) after a long stretch when it seems like merely a live-action ""Little Mermaid"" takes some nice turns away from predictability at the end. NEIL GENZLINGER""Aquamarine"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for the mildest of language violations and innuendo.

This mermaid (Sara Paxton) wants to find her own man not some merman chosen by her father. 20th Century Fox The best of those performances comes from Sara Paxton who plays a mermaid who leaves the briny deep and turns up in a pool at a beach club in Florida. Though she sometimes seems as if she could be the younger sister of Darryl Hannah in Splash with a dash of The Little Mermaids Ariel thrown in Paxton manages to make the part her own. Her endearing exuberance and cheerful innocence save a fairly contrived premise from going under. Aquamarine is an independent mermaid who swims away from home to avoid being married off to an arrogant merman. If she can prove to her father that love exists (apparently it does not underwater) then she can call off the arranged marriage. About the movieAquamarine   1/2 (out of four)Director Elizabeth AllenStars Joanna ""JoJo"" Levesque Emma Roberts Sara PaxtonDistributor 20th Century Fox Rating PG for mild language and sensualityRunning time 1 hour 49 minutesOpens Friday nationwide Her controlling undersea dad generates powerful storms in an effort to lure her back to her oceanic home. No it doesnt make much sense nor does it add much dramatic tension. The Alice Hoffman young adult novel on which the movie is based had more substance. Pop singer Joanna ""JoJo"" Levesque is the films other bright light with a winning natural style as 13-year-old Hailey that contrasts with the more forced efforts of Emma Roberts as best pal Claire. Haileys marine biologist mother is about to uproot them for a job in Australia. Hailey is desolate about leaving her beachfront town and Claire who is still struggling with a fear of water after the drowning deaths of her parents. These serious issues are dealt with fairly lightly but not inappropriately for the target audience. Soon after explaining her quest for love Aquamarine sets her sights on Raymond (Jake McDorman) a hunky lifeguard. Her naive new buddies give her pointers by deluging her with magazine articles on romance. Aquamarines doggedly goofy adherence to these social rules are among the movies highlights (though reminiscent in some ways of The Little Mermaid without its charms). And the girls-just-wanna-go-shopping montage feels tired and overdone. But there is substantial chemistry between McDorman and Paxton and some cute moments among the three lead girls. Aquamarines simple message about love is refreshingly realistic particularly in the context of a fairy tale fish-out-of-water story.

"Aquamarine Tween Appeal washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Aquamarine Tween Appeal Claire (Emma Roberts left) and Hailey (Joanna ""JoJo"" Levesque) help a mermaid (Sara Paxton) in ""Aquamarine."" (By Vince Valitutti) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints Friday March 3 2006 Its hard out there for a tween. With Hollywood focusing laser-like on either G-rated kids cartoons that make a zillion in DVD sales or horror flicks and sex comedies that keep those cherished 17-year-olds coming back for repeat business in theaters 10- to 13-year-olds -- especially girls -- are often left behind. Whats more appealing to their singular sensibilities which teeter between schoolgirl innocence and burgeoning sophistication is a difficult needle to thread. At least ""Aquamarine"" tries. Based on Alice Hoffmans novel of the same name the mild-mannered comedy tells the story of 13-year-old best friends Claire (Emma Roberts) and Hailey (Joanna ""JoJo"" Levesque) who discover something strange in their beach clubs swimming pool after a bad storm a mermaid named Aquamarine (Sara Paxton) who has come ashore to find true love. She immediately sets her baby blues on a lifeguard named Raymond (Jake McDorman) whom Claire and Hailey have been crushing on all summer. The direction by Elizabeth Allen isnt particularly distinguished and there are no stand-out performances to speak of even from pop star JoJo making her big-feature debut (someone should put her in a movie as Lindsay Lohans little sister). Still ""Aquamarine"" is better than nothing for its woefully underserved audience. -- Ann Hornaday Aquamarine PG 109 minutes Contains mild profanity and sensuality. Area theaters.

"Aquamarine | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; aquamarine ) Aquamarine (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Its not a stretch to say that I am not a member of Aquamarines target demographic. Its a good bet that about 90% of the films viewers will be girls between the ages of 8 and 14. Im sure the movie works better for them than it did for me. Still all things considered I have to admit that sitting through Aquamarine was not the most unpleasant recent cinematic experience I have had. The plot - a clichA(c)-riddled modern day amalgamation of two fairy tales (""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Cinderella"") - wont win points for originality but the screenplay includes some snappy dialogue smart observations and an uplifting message about the importance of friendship. And although there are a fair number of stock characters including the bitchy bitch and the studly stud the protagonists are likable and nicely rounded. The problem faced by 20th Century Fox is selling the movie. Aquamarine takes place in a Florida Beach resort during the last week of summer. This is a melancholy time for all school-age children but more so for best friends Claire (Emma Roberts) and Hailey (Joanna JoJo Levesque) who are about to be separated by oceans and time zones. Haileys mother has received a plum job offer in Australia and shes packing up and taking her daughter with her. Claire and Hailey desperate not to be parted pray for a miracle. Thats when Aquamarine (Sara Paxton) a mermaid arrives. During a violent storm she is swept in from the sea to end up in Claires pool. After getting over the initial shock of finding a girl with a fishtail in Claires backyard the two girls bond with the newcomer. They learn a few facts about mermaid life and lore. Mermaids can grow legs but only when the sun is out and provided they stay away from water. They can grant a wish to someone who helps them. And Aquamarine is in trouble with her daddy. She has refused an arranged marriage and is determined to prove to her father that the mythical emotion of ""love"" exists. To that end she is determined to seduce a human boy. She chooses local lifeguard hunk Raymond (Jake McDorman) as her target. Claire and Hailey wanting to earn the wish so they can stay together agree to help. But theres a complication Raymond is also being pursued by Cecilia (Arielle Kebbel) the resorts richest most stuck up girl and she doesnt believe in playing fair. Most of what you expect to happen in Aquamarine happens. There is a nice little twist near the end and it allows the movie to close on a more mature note that it might have otherwise done. Betraying its roots in older more familiar stories the movie plays like a modern-day fairy tale complete with a concluding moral. Each of the characters is allotted a fate in accordance with his/her actions during the film. Yet the overall predictability of the storyline is at least partially compensated for by a breezy approach and genial air. Aquamarine may not be deep but at least its not leaden. Im not familiar with the director or any of the leads. This is Elizabeth Allens first feature foray behind the camera and she captures the right tone for the material. The three young female stars all generate a sensation of dA(c)jA  vu. Sara Paxton recalls a young Reese Witherspoon. Pop starlet JoJo brings to mind a slightly older singer/actress from her Freaky Friday pre-paparazzi fodder days. (That would be Lindsey Lohan.) And Emma Roberts is the niece of Julia Roberts. All three have previous credits but primarily in the kinds of TV shows its unlikely an adult male would be familiar with. As ""tween"" girl-oriented movies go this one holds its own although its not in the same league as the recent best of these The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (which boasted better acting stronger direction and a more satisfying story). Curmudgeonly critics like me may not be intoxicated by Aquamarines froth but the film is likely to make its target demographic giddy. So its a solid recommendation for young girls and those unfortunate parents trapped into chaperone duty. For everyone else especially those possessing a Y chromosome theres not much of interest. But then you werent planning to see it anyway were you?

Thats more than can be said about the rest of this movie a filmy pool of tropes and tchotchkes stereotypically associated with Girls of Today. When Aquamarine (perky-pretty Sara Paxton her twinkly expressions perfected on the TV series Darcys Wild Life) tumbles into the swimming pool of a Florida beach club during a storm shes all tail. But after shes befriended by trustworthy 13-year-old best friends Claire (Emma Roberts still answering to the description ""niece of Julia"") and Hailey (Joanna ""JoJo"" Levesque) she reveals her day legs and confides her mission If she can convince her mythological father -- that would be Neptune King of the Sea -- that earthly love is real (in three days) then she can get out of an arranged marriage to an unappealing merman. Aquamarine sets her sights on a cute lifeguard Raymond (Jake McDorman) and its still the same old story Girl meets boy girl hides fins for fear of rejection boy cant understand why girl is acting so...fishy. Thats only half the deal in this floppy production based on a novel by Alice Hoffman and directed in a pink-centric feature debut by Elizabeth Allen. Claire (the fearful one) and Hailey (the rebellious one) have their own girlsville issues. Plus theyre crushing on Raymond too. That everything gets worked out -- friendship affirmed jokes made about silly magazine articles on reeling in a boy -- is as sure as the soundtracks inclusion of a Mandy Moore song. In such a well-behaved femme aquarium Im far more diverted by the antics of the designated Mean Girl a conniving queen bee called Cecilia. Played with well-honed comic obnoxiousness by Gilmore Girls Arielle Kebbel Cecilia -- another lifeguard luster who wants Raymond for her own boy toy -- slithers through her classic bitch role with cheerful sharkiness while Aquamarine flounders.
