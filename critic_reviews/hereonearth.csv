Here on Earth a determinedly old-fashioned young persons weepie wants to be an antidote to the roguish doings in such sexpot teen romps as Wild Things and Cruel Intentions. I say wants to be because despite the bucolic setting (green Minnesota passing as the verdant Berkshires) the small-town esprit (the home team is called the Mudhens) and the repeated quoting of Robert Frosts oh-sensitive-me poem ""Birches"" the dubious lessons of this teen-love tragedy are these (1) Unruly passion can make a girl weak in the knees literally; (2) choosing between two men is harmful to ones health; (3) townies always know more about whats important in life than gownies; (4) one could do worse than be a swinger of birches. And although homilies about love and loss and the rinsing pleasures of a good movie cry are always welcome something there is that doesnt love a cliche. I should point out that despite warning-sign dialogue such as ""Dr. Falco called to confirm your appointment tomorrow"" the girlfriend in question Samantha (Leelee Sobieski) is as spirited as a gazelle. Her cute dad (Bruce Greenwood) is the local sheriff; her cute boyfriend Jasper (Josh Hartnett) is the local farmers kid whos known her since childhood. But Kelley (Chris Klein) is cuter. Hes a snotty but redeemable preppy at the local boarding school who swaggers into the diner where Samantha works falls for her lovely eyebrows and soft voice (and she for his) gets into a drag race with Jasper and accidentally destroys the restaurant. I shall be telling this with a sigh Kelleys punishment -- helping to rebuild what hes ruined while living with Jasper and his family -- is supposed to reconstruct character too. And of course it does. Hard labor among honest working folk fresh air and a blooming teen girlfriend can make even the cockiest loneliest most badly parented Richie Rich learn the value of intimacy. Whats more apparent though at least as directed by TV helmer Mark Piznarski (Relativity) from a simplistic script by Michael Seitzman is the importance of velvety lighting on Kleins handsome torso and Sobieskis sincere face. Both promising actors gleam with the luster of fine recent performances (he in Election and American Pie she in Eyes Wide Shut and Never Been Kissed) but neither is up to carrying such a lip trembler of a tale without inadvertently inviting laughter at key moments. (Among the unfortunate miscalculations During a modest lovers-in-the-grass scene Kelley names one of Samanthas breasts New Jersey the other New York.)

"Here on Earth | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; here-on-earth ) Here on Earth (United States 2000) A movie review by James Berardinelli Note to readers this review contains spoilers. Those who wish to see Here On Earth without having previous knowledge of certain plot elements would do well to bail out now and return after they have seen the film. They say that anything can happen in the movies and Here On Earth gives several examples of it. A self-centered jock willingly gives his lifelong love to his rival. A girl dying of cancer suffers no pain or distress as the disease ravages her body. And most incredibly of all two teenagers show evidence of having memorized poetry. Thus does Here On Earth a tearjerker for teens strain our suspension of disbelief. Credibility issues aside the movie is not well written. Director Mark Piznarski (who cut his teeth on such TV shows as ""Relativity"" and ""NYPD Blue"") and screenwriter Michael Seitzman both apparently having recently graduated from Melodrama 101 apply all the cliches they can uncover. You know things have entered the realm of the overly-familiar when you can predict whole segments of dialogue - that is when those lines arent howlingly laughable. The story centers around an uninspired love affair then tries to develop dramatic power by employing traditional techniques of audience manipulation. In a way I envy people who fall for this sort of thing because at least theyll get something out of the movie which is more than I can say for myself. The early portions of Here On Earth are as drenched in testosterone as the later parts are in estrogen. Kelley Morse (Chris Klein) is a stuck-up senior at Rallston Academy an exclusive boys prep school set just outside of Hicksville New York. One evening Kelley and his buddies take a joyride into town where they get into it with one of the locals Jasper Arnold (Josh Hartnett) and his friends. An out-of-control car race ensues ending with a crash and a local diner going up in flames. Kelley and Jasper are arrested and the judge sentences them to probation as long as they work for free with the employed crew to rebuild the diner which is owned by the family of Jaspers girlfriend Samantha (Leelee Sobieski). But when Sam spies Kelley without his shirt on all thoughts of Jasper slip from her mind. Soon the two of them are running through the woods together staring vacantly at beautiful naturescapes and reciting Robert Frost (my favorite poet incidentally) to each other. But tragedy looms ahead as Samantha becomes stricken with one of those mysterious cancers that only victimize attractive women in movies. Since the characters are not written with any degree of depth or feeling its up to the actors to bring them to life. In that regard Leelee Sobieski a capable young actress who will almost certainly be cast as Helen Hunts daughter in some upcoming film is successful. Sobieski who has appeared in A Soldiers Daughter Never Cries Deep Impact and Eyes Wide Shut on the big screen and as the title character in the made-for-TV production Joan of Arc is a genuine talent and she does impressive things with this underwritten part. Unfortunately her co-stars arent up to the challenge. Josh Hartnett (H20) is flat and Chris Klein (American Pie) fails to convince us that his character is undergoing the uncaring snob-to-perfect guy transformation. His robotic performance is fine early in the film but it doesnt get the job done later. The supporting cast includes Annette OToole Michael Rooker (not playing a psycho for a change) and Canadian actor Bruce Greenwood. Greenwood gets to play a scene where he weeps uncontrollably over his daughters fate. Its one of the movies few moving moments but this is probably because Greenwood has had practice. This is the third film in which he has portrayed a bereft parent (the other two being Atom Egoyans masterpieces Exotica and The Sweet Hereafter). Ultimately Here On Earth doesnt serve a purpose beyond giving melodramatically susceptible girls in the audience a chance to cry. Perhaps the filmmakers believe that since its aimed at a relatively young crowd (witness the ""soft"" PG-13 rating) they dont have to worry overmuch about things like a well-crafted story. And it doesnt matter if the males can act; they just have to look good with their shirts off. (Sobieski by the way keeps hers on proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that this movie is not at all male-oriented. Although it is perhaps worth mentioning that one of the guys nicknames her breasts ""New York"" and ""New Jersey"".) It seems probable that when the final box office tallies come in Here On Earth will be in a low orbit.

Starring Leelee Sobieski Chris Klein and Josh Hartnett. Directed by Mark Piznarski. (PG-13. 92 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Here on Earth"" is the second of two good movies about love opening today. The first ""Waking the Dead"" is about young love and this one is about very young love first love the kind that happens between teenagers. Its the oldest subject in the world and the newest. The least that can be said for ""Here on Earth"" is that its a showcase for three up-and- coming actors who have enough talent to be unstoppable. Chris Klein who played amiable jocks in his first two films ""Election"" and ""American Pie"" here plays a rich boy with a chip on his shoulder. Slumming in the town where he goes to prep school Kelley flirts with a waitress Samantha (Leelee Sobieski) and ends up in a fight with her boyfriend Jasper (Josh Hartnett). Theres also a run-in with the law. The upshot rich boy ordered by judge to spend summer living and working in lower-middle-class Boston suburb. ""Here on Earth"" doesnt indulge in the cli che that the poor are better off than the rich. Money is not Kelleys problem. Even as he grows and opens up his money gives him an edge a faint quality of distance. Klein conveys that quality while still making Kelley a sympathetic character. In a way ""Here on Earth"" is Kleins movie. He plays the fellow who takes the journey and finds his world view transformed. But Sobieski who plays the girl responsible for that transformation gives the picture its magic. As Samantha she is completely green and yet perceptive and intelligent. Her low voice suggests the woman shell become while her diffident gestures and shaky eye contact are leftovers from childhood. Sobieski also has a great look for the part -- pretty but gawky as if she hasnt yet got used to inhabiting a grown-up body. There are things lovers dont say to each other after the age of 20. Samantha and Kelley are teenagers so they say all those things. They talk about poetry. They talk about what they imagine heaven is like. ""Here on Earth"" distinguishes itself by not taking the easy way out Its not about sex. The authenticity of the dialogue and the sensitivity of Mark Piznarskis direction persuade the viewer that these are two souls making their first intimate connection. Watching it one feels the size and importance of this event in their lives. At the center of ""Here on Earth"" is the love triangle with poor Jasper the longtime boyfriend the odd man out. Hartnett does a beautiful job as a confident kid successfully hiding the fact that hes scared to death. He barely shows us his fear that hell lose Samantha but theres no mistaking it -- nor the fact that its eating him up. Yet for all of Hartnetts and Kleins virtues the attention keeps coming back to Sobieski. Her performance is lovely. Late in the picture Sobieski has some line-readings that are so emotionally full strange and truthful that really nothing more need be said. ..

No Troy Donahue doesnt make an appearance in ""Here on Earth"" -- it just seems he will at any moment in this ultra-soft meller. Thats because the heart of the pubescent romancer seems deep in the Eisenhower era so predictable are its dramatic points so conservative is its overall filmmaking stance. Because the storys pre-fab nature robs project of its intended value as an emotional tragedy pic is sure to leave most auds unmoved and empty. Young teen girls will flock to pic in droves dragging their boyfriends or other girlfriends. But pic seems locked in to that demo alone utterly lacking the edge or spark to draw a larger youth crowd here or abroad. Seemingly conceived as a deliberately retro counterbalance to the generally cynical-leaning youth pic parade ""Here on Earth"" hints at a serious core underlined by casting of exceptionally gifted lead thesps Leelee Sobieski Chris Klein and Josh Hartnett. This is Sobieskis first spin in the mainstream contempo arena after extraordinarily different turns in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" the TV ""Joan of Arc"" and ""A Soldiers Daughter Never Cries."" Kleins change here is even more striking appearing as a rich young jerk after playing funny roles in ""American Pie"" and ""Election."" New pic swirls around both of them but theyre unable to break out of what amounts to a straitjacket of a script by Michael Seitzman. Klein portrays Kelley an uncaring preppy valedictorian of his private boys school whod rather receive delivery on a new Mercedes from wheeler-dealer dad John (Stuart Wilson) than have him attend graduation. With new steed but sans motivation Kelley and his pals tool off to the rural town near school simply it seems to pester Jasper (Hartnett) and try to pick up on his nice g.f. Samantha (Sobieski) who waits tables with the rest of her family at diner owned by her mom (Annette OToole). Dared by Kelley Jasper races him down dirt roads their chase ending with a crash at a gas station that starts a fire that burns down the diner next to it. The boys are dutifully sentenced to rebuild the diner as community service under supervision of Jaspers dad Malcolm (Michael Rooker). Suspended from school and unable to live elsewhere Kelley must live in Jaspers home but soon has his eye on Samantha. Incredibly Samantha drops salt-of-the-earth Jasper and falls head-over-heels for Kelley seemingly because she spies on him as he recites his valedictory address quoting from her fave poet Robert Frost the first inkling given of Kelleys thoughtful introspective side. Pic thus seems to set up an Inge-with-training-wheels scenario with huge love triangle eruptions. Incredibly virtually no sparks fly for Jasper meekly gives up with hardly a struggle. His weak oft-repeated mantra to Samantha ""Were real ... weve always been real"" is something even Hartnett cant make real and even Sobieski cant play off of and it typifies the serious problems with unlikely yet formulaic storyline. Pic slips into melodrama of the mustiest sort as Samanthas old knee problems stemming from her days as a track athlete emerge into cancer sending Kelley -- who lost his mother to suicide -- reeling. Medically sudden health turn is unlikely as it is laid out here. Dramatically the tragedy couldnt possibly be flatter exemplified by how unaffecting the grief shared by Samantha and her father (Bruce Greenwood) is. Fault lies not with thesps who do their level best but in the script and helmer Mark Piznarskis utterly unimaginative direction. TV vet indicates no eye for the larger screen and directs his cast to keep things just as small. Klein and Sobieski while ready and willing to show off their strengths come off as constrained even as their lovers story is meant to be about breaking free. Hartnett is shackled by terribly one-note role which could have been the catalyst for a much higher-charged pic. Adult support handled by fine thesps is workmanlike at best. Pic is fair in all tech departments though given romantic tragedy implications Michael D. OSheas lensing could have more powerfully captured lush green Minnesota locales.
