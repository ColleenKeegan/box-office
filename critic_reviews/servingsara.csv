With Matthew Perry Elizabeth Hurley Bruce Campbell Vincent Pastore. Directed by Reginald Hudlin. Running time 96 mins. Rated PG-13 Crude humor sexual content and language. 1 Star. Pray let us not forget ""Serving Sara"" when it comes time to dole out Worst Screenplay awards for 2002. This depressingly lifeless comedy is jam-packed with talented comic actors including Matthew Perry Elizabeth Hurley Vincent Pastore and standup comedian Cedric (The Entertainer) Kyles. The director is Reginald Hudlin whose ""House Party"" and the underrated ""The Ladies Man"" (yes you read me right) were quite funny. And yet ""Serving Sara"" is D.O.A. with nary a laugh to be found. Although many things may have gone wrong including Perrys much-publicized stint in rehab which set back production the sophomoric unimaginative screenplay by Jay Scherick and David Ronn surely didnt help. Perry plays process server Joe Tyler a luckless schlub who unethically ""flips marks"" when Sara Moore (Hurley) pays him to help serve divorce papers on her husband a cattle rancher (Bruce Campbell) instead of vice versa. This takes the toothsome twosome on a road trip to Texas where the grand comic set piece involves Joes being mistaken for a vet with expertise in cattle reproduction. He grabs the bull but not by the horns. Pastore Big Pussy from ""The Sopranos"" plays a rival process server who is trying to serve Sara. The spouse who gets served first gets the lousier deal in the divorce settlement due to state-law technicalities. The cardboard cutouts - oops characters - try to outwit each other until a grand finale at a monster-truck show. There is a wan attempt at catering to the skills of the individual actors. For instance Perry has opportunities to use various accents and someone decided perhaps too hastily that Hurley is good at pratfalls. But the pieces never hang together so the movie is unable to build toward its obvious conclusion. Kyles is pretty much in his own separate movie playing the process servers boss back in the lonely New York office. He gets to ham it up a bit between yelling by phone at his incompetent underlings. Did I say there was nothing funny here? I misspoke. There are two funny lines one involving sheep the other a priceless line-reading by Perry during the monster-truck show. Its not enough however to stop you from wanting to serve a subpoena of your own.

Share Tweet About halfway through the misbegotten late-summer special Serving Sara Matthew Perry gets himself into a situation where hes called upon to massage the prostate of a flatulent prize-winning bull named Tornado. Gross-out gags like that one have become de rigueur in American comedies even in movies without ""National Lampoon"" preceding the title; in fact the same cattle-fisting bit appeared in the Farrelly Brothers knock-off Say It Isnt So. But what is it doing in the middle of an otherwise innocuous PG-13 romantic comedy? Falling back on lowbrow hijinks may be epidemic in Hollywood but the need for such a desperate ploy sets in quickly as might be expected from a zany farce about process serving. Fletch lives again in Perry who adopts a half-hearted array of silly accents and disguises in order to put subpoenas in the hands of would-be defendants. After months of suspiciously elusive marks put Perrys job in jeopardy his boss (Cedric The Entertainer) assigns him the seemingly easy task of serving divorce papers to Elizabeth Hurley the trophy wife of philandering Texas cattle magnate Bruce Campbell. Despite the efforts of a rival process server (Vincent Pastore) to divert him Perry tracks her down but rather than hand her the subpoena the two work out a questionable scheme to serve Campbell first. With divorce courts more favorable to women in New York City than Texas Hurley stands to receive a larger cut of the estate assuring Perry a 1 million chunk of the settlement for his cooperation. A third-rate conflation of Midnight Run and It Happened One Night Serving Sara relies heavily on Perrys perpetually exasperated shtick which fits more comfortably among the democratic ensemble of TVs Friends. His insincerity and ironic detachment works well within half-hour blocks of coffeehouse and apartment banter but as a leading man Perry works up a serious case of flop-sweat while trying to squeeze laughs out of thin air and feign romantic chemistry with Hurley who looks anxious as ever to accommodate him. To be fair the most seasoned screen comic could do nothing with a non-starter like Serving Sara especially under the leaden hand of director Reginald Hudlin whose last film 2000s The Ladies Man was a non-starter even by Saturday Night Live standards. When all else fails Hudlin cuts away to Cedric The Entertainer flailing around in his office or Pastore getting a wig shop shaved off his back. Under the circumstances Serving Sara can almost be forgiven for taking refuge in a bulls rectum. Where else could it go?

Comments Serving Sara Romantic comedy ought to have some romance and laughs but this extraordinarily flat effort has neither. A cynical wisecracking process server who really wants to be a wine maker meets his match in a rich beauty hes supposed to serve with divorce papers. Matthew Perry whose dry sarcasm on TV is amusing enough is simply snide and nasty and Elizabeth Hurley displays all the depth of her cosmetics commercials. Yet both come off as victims of a very bad script directed without any sense of pacing. The formula screwball elements are all there--the battling couple forced to spend time together the wacky adventures the cartoonish antagonists. But the slapstick is poorly executed the one-liners are creaky and the romantic chemistry is nonexistent. Theres even a bit of gross-out humor involving Perry stimulating a bulls libido. Implausibility piles on unpleasantness until it all fortunately comes to an end. Directed by Reginald Hudlin. 100 min.

"This Serving  hardly satisfying | CJOnline.com Toggle navigation Home News Local Business Sports Weather Subscribe Obits Classifieds Classifieds Local Jobs Homes Search This Serving  hardly satisfying Serving Sara Rated PG-13 for crude humor sexual content and language the film opens today at the West Ridge Mall 6 Posted Friday August 23 2002 By By Christy LemireThe Associated Press Crass and joyless ""Serving Sara"" would have been an unfortunate movie anyway. But it is also the victim of unfortunate timing. Photos Back | Next Back | Next It stars Matthew Perry as a process server who dreams of owning a Napa Valley vineyard and makes his own wine in his apartment. It is a sad irony watching him sample his concoctions knowing that his much-publicized stint in rehab early last year forced production on ""Serving Sara"" to shut down for several weeks. A more serious problem Jokes that wouldnt have been funny before Sept. 11 are painfully uncomfortable now. Perrys character Joe and Sara (Elizabeth Hurley) a wealthy woman to whom he was supposed to serve divorce papers team up to salvage her share of her cattle baron husbands fortune and end up being chased through Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. They jump onto a baggage conveyor belt and bang around with the luggage just to set up a sight gag in which Saras jeans rip. She ends up in her panties scavenging through peoples suitcases for something to wear before throwing together an ensemble consisting of a tight black T-shirt a naughty schoolgirl skirt and cowboy boots. That is the punch line. It is hard to laugh though because the scene is such a glaring anachronism in these days of heightened airport security. (The movie finished shooting in May 2001.) Later Saras husband Gordon (Bruce Campbell) tries to avoid having divorce papers served on him by hiding in the audience at a monster truck show. (It is loud and obnoxious -- the only reason for the setting.) Joe gets the crowd to move away from Gordon by flashing his photo on the Jumbotron and announcing over the loudspeaker that he has the Ebola virus. Everyone runs screaming and crews from the Centers for Disease Control move in to investigate dressed in protective suits. There is nothing funny about this after last years anthrax scare but it wouldnt have been sidesplitting humor before that either. The dialogue from first-time screenwriters Jay Scherick and David Ronn consists of insults hurled back and forth -- none of which can be printed here. The movie also wastes talented character actors like Vincent Pastore and Jerry Stiller by relegating them to one-note roles. It relies on gross-out jokes about cow patties and impotent bulls and telegraphs them a mile away. And it perpetuates stereotypes about Texans and New Yorkers Hispanics and Italians. Then director Reginald Hudlin (""House Party"") has the audacity to turn the movie into a romance. We are supposed to believe that Joe and Saras shared greed has turned to love which manifests itself in the form of tentative kisses in a hotel suite with a soft-rock soundtrack and a bubble bath waiting in the background. Elizabeth Hurley as Sara Moore and Matthew Perry as Joe Tyler star in ""Serving Sara"" opening today at the West Ridge Mall 6. RON PHILLIPS/Paramount Pictures But there is nothing appealing about either of them -- no matter how attractive they may be. Sara by the way has perfect makeup even when she wakes in the morning and at one point avoids receiving her divorce papers by hiding in an Estee Lauder spa the cosmetics company for which Hurley has been a spokeswoman for years with far greater success than she has had as an actress. Perry meanwhile has said he was drawn to the movie because he wanted to play a more dramatic role than that of Chandler his character on NBCs ""Friends.""

Its a synthetic cautionary tale about the limits of celebrity as an acting style. Hurley with puffed and glossed lips and boobs plays the title character whose rich two-timing Texas cattle-ranching husband (Bruce Campbell) is trying to divorce her - and to cheat the apparently classy faithful beautiful gal out of the settlement she deserves. Matthew Perry is Joe a process server who falls for Sara in the course of trying to deliver her walking papers. The movie itself is a cattle ranch full of joke droppings and mooing shtick not worth stepping in. (Cedric the Entertainer does one brand of antic apoplexy as Joes boss while ""The Sopranos"" Vincent Pastore does more as Joes competitive colleague.) And the few jaunty ""Friends""-inflected lines Perry does get off are lost among the cow pies. Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

Upholding the tradition of late-August as a time for minor efforts ""Serving Sara"" is little more than a mall movie designed to kill time. Pic marks an improvement over helmer Reginald Hudlins ""SNL"" spinoff laffer ""The Ladies Man"" and Paramounts ""Rat Race"" which opened about this time last year. This new comedy tracking a subpoena servers adventures from Gotham to Texas wont be enough to kick star Matthew Perry up the movie comedy ladder. Notably diminishing laughs will match B.O. ""Serving Saras"" flicker of chemistry between Perry and Elizabeth Hurley as a soon-to-be divorcee hes trying to serve with a writ is neutralized by a general lack of panache. Watching pics lack of style its easy to imagine what a writer like Elmore Leonard with instincts for impulsive fringe-of-the-law characters could do with this material or in an earlier screen era what Stanley Donen or Billy Wilder may have wrought. Opening bit sets the lame tone as Perrys Joe Tyler goes through strained paces to subpoena a mobster. Things get better when Joe has to deal with his overworked boss Ray (Cedric the Entertainer) and competition from fellow server Tony (Vincent Pastore) who Joe ultimately learns has been tipping off Joes ""marks"" -- folks hes assigned to serve. These include Sara Moore (Hurley) who thinks shes happily married to Texas cattle tycoon Gordon Moore (Bruce Campbell) but is actually getting dumped by him. Sara in New York initially eludes Joe who is armed with the divorce notice. Eventually however he gets the papers into stupefied Saras hands using blatantly poor disguises (and Perrys weak impersonations). Scripts one clever gambit is when Sara learning shell get a better settlement in wife-friendly N.Y. than pro-husband Texas offers Joe 1 million to toss out the subpoena and instead serve Gordon with papers in Lone Star state. This sly move sets off a cross-country chase with Joe placing false clues for Tony (whos pursuing Sara on Rays orders) to lead him off the trail into dead-ends like Miami and Bangor Maine. Joe and Gordon finally meet for the finale during an extreme sports rally in Dallas Union Arena. All too frequently Joe feels like an obstacle-ridden character type from a screenwriting workshop. While the central idea of a subpoena server encountering roadblocks is a sound one the form those roadblocks take in ""Serving Sara"" (ranging from groin-busting gym vixens to sexually stimulating bulls on Gordons ranch) has all the grace of a butt to the head. Pastore and Cedric are in fine form enlivening the office clashes involving Tony and Ray -- the latter amusingly never leaving an office thats stuffed with stress-reducing devices. Whatever sexual frissons pass between Perry and Hurley are kept on simmer. And because so little screen time is used to fill in the details of his two-timing Texan Campbell has no real chance to show off his wonderful knack for self-mockery in a vaguely written role. The visually mundane results scream out for a craftier production assembly that would have been able to play up the contrasts between Manhattan and Longhorn country. Francine Jamison-Tanchuck has fun costuming Hurley and Amy Adams as Gordons new g.f. neither of whom are too shy to strut in front of the camera. The further composer Marcus Miller gets from his jazz roots the more unsure his music.

A savvy moviegoer might deduce that from the movies timing. Late summer is often the dumping ground for comedies that go flat or romances that fizzle. Sara is both. It stars Matthew Perry as Joe a cynical process server and Elizabeth Hurley as Sara the shockingly naive wife of a Texas millionaire cattle rancher. Their paths cross when Joe serves Sara with divorce papers. Attempted hilarity ensues. Hurley seems to be walking through the role often looking blank and at times appearing embarrassed to be in this wannabe screwball comedy. Much is made of her voluptuous physique. There doesnt seem to be much else to make something out of given the lame predictable script and the jokes that often fall flat. In one scene she offers a surly clerk in a seedy motel (though not the audience in the theater) a look at her bare breasts and she and Joe get a free room. Theres a lovely message for young audiences who might check out this PG-13 movie. Perry does not fare much better though he at least delivers some of the movies rare funny lines. Romantic screwball comedies are supposed to be at least a little romantic but theres no chemistry between Perry and Hurley. He squints she simpers -- and thats about it. There are better moments from supporting actors Vincent Pastore (The Sopranos Big Pussy who now sleeps with the fishes) as Joes rival and Cedric the Entertainer as Joes boss. But nothing is enough to save this Sara.

Directed by Reginald Hudlin from a screenplay by Jay Scherick and David Ronn. 100 minutes. Rated PG-13 for crude humor sexual content and language. Several theaters. ""Serving Sara"" is such a miserable excuse for a movie that the constant ringing of a cellphone at its preview screening served only to improve it. Could this be Elizabeth Hurley I wondered calling to offer apologies for her participation in this travesty pleading that single moms need all the work they can get? Or perhaps Matthew Perry explaining that earning untold millions from ""Friends"" isnt enough -- his dream was always to make a movie that required him to don a large rubber glove and do something nasty to a bull? Or a red-faced executive from Paramount Pictures saying that it was all a big mistake and we could leave now? Alas I never did find out who was on that ever-ringing line but I envied the caller -- he or she at least wasnt having to sit through the movie. In it Perry plays Joe a spiky-haired process server who dreams of becoming a winemaker someday. As the prospects for vintners in midtown Manhattan are somewhat limited he makes a living hunting down those who do not wish to be found and handing them court papers. Among those is Sara (Hurley) the soon-to-be-divorced wife of a wealthy cattle rancher. Sara and Joe eventually team up for reasons far too tiresome to go into here and off we go to Texas for numerous unfunny shenanigans. Hurley whos got cheekbones you could cut out paper dolls with earns her paycheck by tossing her hair around a lot and flouncing around in a teeny miniskirt. But she and Perry both seem like theyre somewhere else; their chemistry is so nonexistent its as if they shot the film on separate continents. And theyre not helped by a screenplay that seems to have been made up on the fly. At one point Joe and Sara kiss in a hotel room -- with about the same enthusiasm that Perry brought to the bull encounter -- and break apart with Sara saying urgently that their priority now must be to find her husband. Then she goes off and takes a nice long bath. Theres nothing funny in this would-be comedy and director Reginald Hudlin seems to know it -- he resorts to desperate tricks like cutting to reaction shots of Hurley laughing when Perry says a line. As for the movies physical humor heres a sample Hurley fleeing a thug at an airport runs through the check-in portal of the luggage conveyer belt and squeals as she goes down the chute. Perry goes after her and a terrible calamity happens causing him to rip off a leg of her designer jeans. Oh no Elizabeth Hurley with a leg exposed? How can this be? ""Serving Sara"" which feels astonishingly long at 100 minutes is dreck. As Joe and Sara headed off to the cattle ranch aided by such sparkling dialogue as ""Oh get a mute button for yourself"" I slumped in my seat. In the darkness the cellphone rang again. Maybe its Hudlin I thought saying he was forced to make the movie at gunpoint. Maybe Katharine Hepburn calling to say that screwball isnt really dead. Maybe its. ... But it just kept on ringing.

Starring Martina Gedeck and Sergio Castellitto. Directed by Sandra Nettelbeck. (PG. 107 minutes. In German with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Mostly Martha"" is one of the best movies about love to come along in months and part of the reason is that its not a romance per se. Its just a movie about a woman whos not bubbly perky or pining in the usual romantic way. Shes prickly distant and fairly content with her regimented life as a chef in a posh restaurant. This little gem from Germany stars Martina Gedeck as Martha a woman who is so clipped and forbidding that it takes five or 10 minutes to notice that shes quite beautiful. Martha is not neurotic just seriously Teutonic. What she needs in her life but neither knows it nor wants it is an Italian guy who can make great pasta and sing while doing it. The Italian arrives in the form of a gentle manly sous chef named Mario (Italian star Sergio Castellitto) whom Martha finds immediately threatening. But then shes under stress anyway having recently assumed temporary custody of her niece as a result of a family tragedy. The wonder of ""Mostly Martha"" is the performance of Gedeck who makes Martha enormously endearing by letting us gradually come to understand that her strong front is a gallant bluff. Underneath she is a basket case of vulnerability and insecurity but Martha never wallows in that basket. As a result shes someone to admire. Shes also funny. In one scene she walks into her kitchen where Mario has prepared their dinner and sees a mess of dirty pots and spilled sauce. She starts hyperventilating. The sensuousness of food has become a movie cliche -- kind of like intellectuals rhapsodizing about baseball -- but ""Mostly Martha"" reclaims the cliche by not overplaying it. Its a movie that can make audiences walk out both randy and hungry and so as not to confuse ones priorities it might be best to have dinner before seeing it. -- Mick LaSalle SERVING SARA Romantic comedy. Starring Matthew Perry and Elizabeth Hurley. Directed by Reginald Hudlin. (PG-13. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Matthew Perry goes through the romantic comedy ""Serving Sara"" needing a shave with his hair standing up and his eyes looking dead. He looks as if he slept all night on a park bench and he acts surly and bitter as if he hadnt slept well. Normally a likable actor he gives about as charmless a performance as possible as though getting paid to kiss Elizabeth Hurley were a really lousy job. Perry isnt the only thing wrong with ""Serving Sara"" but hes the thing that takes a pleasantly mediocre movie and turns it into an unpleasantly mediocre one. He plays Joe a process server who hands divorce papers to a Texas cattlemans wife (Hurley) -- then switches sides and agrees to work as a process server on her behalf. Its a romp or its intended to be Lots of locations lots of silly adventures and along the way a romance. Hurley demonstrates as usual her comic timing but most of the gags are Perrys. In the course of his job Joe assumes various identities but Perrys comic efforts are halfhearted. He seems almost embarrassed to be trying to act funny and so it becomes embarrassing to watch him. Its a sure sign that something is wrong when the movie sets up a rivalry between Joe and another process server (Vincent Pastore) and the rival emerges as more sympathetic. Its also a bad sign when the funniest actor is in a minor role. The comedian Cedric the Entertainer plays Joes greedy boss and has the right spirit -- over the top silly and generous. According to reports Perry went into rehab for two months during the making of ""Serving Sara."" Coincidence? Maybe. He does look better at the end of the movie than at the beginning but since films are rarely shot in sequence its hard to know what to make of that. If anything. . This film contains crude humor and sexual content. -- Mick LaSalle SWIMMING Drama. Starring Lauren Ambrose Joelle Carter Jennifer Dundas Lowe. Directed by Robert J. Siegel. (Not rated. 98 minutes. At Opera Plaza). When Josee (Joelle Carter) waitress drifter and all-around good-time gal struts into a beach-town diner its clear shes about to lay waste to the hearts around her. Sinuous and supremely self-assured shes a classic movie vixen and director Robert J. Siegel knows to give her the proper entrance. The character veers from archetype however in the triangle she creates one that concerns two other young women and friendship more than lust. Though theres some of that too. Keenly observed and refreshingly natural ""Swimming"" gets the details right from its promenade of barely clad bodies in Myrtle Beach S.C. to the adrenaline jolt of a sudden lunch rush at the diner. This film sort of a ""Ruby in Paradise"" with more erotic intrigue might have been lost -- it was made in 2000 -- did it not star Lauren Ambrose Claire from HBOs ""Six Feet Under."" Ambrose brings the same detached hopefulness she shows on ""Six Feet"" to the role of Frankie a college-age woman running the coffee shop with her older brother. The actress face lights up with pure wonder when Frankie spies Josee (Frankie and Josee get it?). Shes got a crush as does her brother and half the town. You can see the appeal. Josees exotic (having been to Hawaii) and pays attention to what Frankie says often touching her hand for a little longer than is polite. In contrast Frankies longtime best friend (Jennifer Dundas Lowe) a hellion and professional body piercer is less than fully engaged with Frankie. The friend is attentive enough to see a threat in Josee however and scenes of the three together are studies in complex female friendship. Frankies new friend and her old one are natural adversaries since each is invested in being the light of her life. But the old friend cant compete with the newcomers whiff of sexual intrigue. Dundas Lowe a New York stage actress who played Diane Keatons lesbian daughter in ""The First Wives Club"" gives the standout performance here turning her spitfire role into something uncliched. The character might be ornery and jealous but the actress lends her an undercurrent of true devotion and a sense of betrayal that really stings. As Josee Carter seems too reserved at first but then again the quiet ones often are the most insinuating. She gives the character a ""who me?"" disingenuousness mixed with genuine affection for Frankie. That Josee shows similar affection for most men in town is another story. . This film contains raw language sexual situations. -- Carla Meyer METROPOLIS 1927 science-fiction drama. Starring Brigitte Helm and Gustav Frohlich. Directed by Fritz Lang. (Not rated. 120 minutes. At the Castro.) Fritz Langs ""Metropolis"" is back. What that old thing? Well no not exactly. If youve seen ""Metropolis"" on video or at the movies even in a ""restoration"" youve seen a butchered print. The film originally released at more than two hours has existed for decades in a variety of versions all of them topping out at about 90 minutes. But not this ""Metropolis."" This new incarnation the work of a consortium of German archives runs a full two hours long and uses every scrap of available footage and from the best possible sources. Digitally restored cleaned up and given an imposing orchestral soundtrack the newest ""Metropolis"" may still be shy of the originals running time (approximately 135 minutes) but its the longest fullest version that anyone has seen since its Berlin premiere 75 years ago. Seeing it is a time-bending experience a way of visiting the past and glimpsing the pasts idea of the future. A masterpiece of art direction the movie has influenced our vision of the future ever since with its imposing white monoliths and starched facades. In ""Metropolis"" the upper class inhabits the citys surface while workers held in little better than slave conditions live and work in underground mines. Brigitte Helm plays a saintly figure named Maria who rallies the workers and acts on their behalf. But she is imprisoned by the ruling powers and a replica robot Maria is sent down to the mines to incite the workers to a self- destructive riot. Since its premiere the movies unsettling vision has been open to a variety of interpretations. It can be seen as a warning against fascist tyranny communist oppression or capitalism run amok. Yet in a way the most rewarding way to see it is not as a prescient work but as a film very much of its time a missive from an age of anxiety. -- Mick LaSalle LITTLE SECRETS Drama. Starring Evan Rachel Wood Michael Angarano David Gallagher and Vivica A. Fox. Directed by Blair Treu. Written by Jessica Barondes. (PG. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In ""Little Secrets"" a smart teenage violinist named Emily (Evan Rachel Wood) has the talent and discipline to be a world-class musician. Her life seems perfect. Surrounded by caring parents she lives in a bucolic suburb has many friends and -- in her spare time as a way of offering a service she never had as a kid -- runs a 50-cent booth where neighborhood children can come and unburden themselves of secrets. When a family moves next door and Emily learns the eldest son (David Gallagher) was involved in a drunken-driving accident she takes an extreme view of him even though they initially liked each other. At the end of ""Little Secrets"" we learn why Emily was so upset and why keeping a secret can exact a toll on everyone involved. Theres no denying that director Blair Treu has made a touching film that will make audiences smile and cry at young characters who are learning about love and confession. This movie is ideal for families who want to explore the meaning of secrets and friendship and for anyone interested in a sweet story of a violinist determined to make her youth orchestra. The plot twists in ""Little Secrets"" sustain the movie when it gets a bit too schmaltzy. This excess of cuteness and sentimentality wont be a flaw to moviegoers in the mood for it. -- Jonathan Curiel SECRET BALLOT Comedy. Starring Nassim Abdi Cyrus Abidi. Directed and written by Babak Payami. (Not rated. In Farsi with English subtitles. 105 minutes. At the Lumiere and Rafael). ""Secret Ballot"" an absurdist comedy from Iran pokes fun at the countrys undemocratic process. The films satire though mild by American standards has kept it from being released at home. Which just goes to show that ""subversive"" is highly subjective. The best comedy however is universal and ""Secret Ballot"" is too contemplative to be really funny. Scenes that should be zany unfold so slowly so thoughtfully that comic momentum goes bust. The deliberate pacing works initially when writer-director Babak Payami sets the scene at a beachfront military post. The camera lingers on two soldiers during a shift change one replacing the other on a lone cot and gives a sense of a place where nothing ever happens. Except this day is election day and the guard on duty (Cyrus Abidi) must escort an election worker trying to collect votes in the remote area. The gruff lunkheaded guy scoffs when he discovers that the worker is a woman (Nassim Abdi) a ""city girl"" who shows a bit of ankle beneath her chador. In setting up a mismatched couple Payami attempts a Hepburn-Tracy feel and he gives the pairs exchanges some verve. Idealistic and officious the woman talks of how every vote can lead to change. The soldier counters that the rifle strapped to his back has much more influence. As the pair scour the countryside for voters Payami comments on political and social inequities. A 12-year-old girl tries to vote but cannot though she can legally marry. A group of would-be voters travels miles to the ballot box only to find none of their candidates on the official list. Unfortunately every long long setup leads to a similarly bittersweet punch line. Payami recruited nonactors for the two lead roles and and one of them remains a nonactor. Stocky and expressionless Abidi is convincing as a lug but lacks the range to show this guys glimmers of enlightenment. A movie this luxuriously paced needed an actor with oomph to balance it. His co-star Abdi however is a natural Cocky and wet behind the ears shes the perfect candidate for a dose of reality. -- Carla Meyer Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 4 Dear Abby I dont want anyone to know that Ive retired 5 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 6 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F. 7 33 signs youre living in the San Francisco bubble 8 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 9 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 10 San Francisco ranks surprisingly low on the list of 20 Most...

"Comedy Serves No Purpose Other Than To Embarrass Actors - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Matthew Perry Comedy Serves No Purpose Other Than To Embarrass ActorsMovies - REVIEW - Serving SaraMatthew Perry Must Choose Scripts More Wisely If He Wants A Career After Friends.August 23 2002|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticYou may have heard that Matthew Perry interrupted the filming of Serving Sara to check himself into rehab.But after he has seen how the film has turned out he may wish he had never returned to the set.To be fair to poor Perry the problems with this crude clumsy comedy dont seem to be all his fault. In fact the clever offhand humor that he also uses as Chandler Bing on Friends is the only halfway decent thing about the new movie.Perry plays Joe Tyler a process server assigned to serve one Sara Moore (Elizabeth Hurley) with legal papers so her philandering cattle-baron husband (Bruce Campbell) can divorce her.But after Joe serves Sara the two of them make a deal. Joe will pretend that he never served Sara and will instead serve the cattle baron.Due to a legal gimmick whoevers served first stands to lose a lot of money to the other. And if Sara triumphs shell split her windfall with Joe.No its not nearly as confusing as it probably sounds. But its not any more entertaining either.One typical gag involves a rival process server named Tony stepping into cow manure. Another involves Joe ripping half the pants off Sara when her clothes are caught in a machine.Yes its that sort of film. And while Serving Sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest Austin Powers extravaganza theres nothing here to match that movies intermittent moments of inspiration.Very very occasionally the new film brightens when Perrys character tosses off a Chandleresque quip. At one point Joe casually asks the lunkheaded Tony ""You grew up around a lot of lead paint didnt you?""But these moments only serve to emphasize how witless the movie is otherwise.Directed by Reginald Hudlin (The Ladies Man) from a script by Jay Scherick and David Ronn Serving Sara also features Cedric the Entertainer as Joes blustery boss and Vincent Pastore (The Sopranos) as Tony.Perry who once looked quite handsome really appears puffy and run-down here. (The stubble thats almost always on his face doesnt make him look any better or much enrich the character of Joe.)As for Hurley she is always dressed in ugly tasteless clothes and slathered in too much makeup. For several scenes in fact shes in a belly shirt with the words ""Trailer Trash"" emblazoned upon it.Of course its an intentional joke that a woman as fashion-conscious as Hurley would be dressed that way. But the joke wears terribly thin.If Perry is going to have a life after Friends hes going to have to start taking better care of himself. And if hes going to have a show-business life hell have to start picking classier projects.Friends co-star Jennifer Aniston for example found herself a plum role in The Good Girl which like Serving Sara arrives in town today. Perry should follow her lead.All of which raises the question How about a 12-step program to keep actors off lousy movies?

Running time 100 minutes. Rated PG-13 (vulgar humor gunplay). At the E-Walk the Lincoln Square the Battery Park City others. ----- ITS probably too late to advise Matthew Perry not to give up his day job but hes sure going to have to find better material than ""Serving Sara"" if he wants to sustain a post-""Friends"" career in the movies. Even dumber than Perrys ""Three to Tango"" this latest sitcommy exercise is sporadically funny in spite of itself - and not quite as dreadful as you would suspect from the trailers and ads that feature no fewer than three pull-quotes from Earl Dittman of ""Wireless Magazine"" reigning king of the quote whores. We wont even get into Perrys stint in rehab - which halted production on this flick for a while in early 2001. Not that even the most rabid ""Friends"" fan will want to plunk down 10 for a comedy whose big scene has Perry posing as a veterinarian at a Texas ranch (owned in real life by Ross Perot) wearing long rubber gloves massaging a bulls prostate. Perry doesnt exactly stretch his acting muscles as Joe a bumbling New York City process server assigned to serve papers on Sara (Elizabeth Hurley) who is being divorced by her cattleman hubby Gordon (Bruce Campbell in the Bill Pullman part). Sara initially eludes Joe but when he finally catches up with her she makes a counter offer. Shell give him 1 million to forget it - and fly to Texas with her to serve her hubby first since this will supposedly give her 50 percent of his fortune. Screenwriters Jay Scherick and David Ronin a couple of ""Spin City"" veterans dont much develop the premise or the characters which director Reginald Hudlin (""Boomerang"") uses mostly as an excuse to stage slapstick sketches. At one point the leads are trapped on an airport luggage conveyor belt which results in Sara losing her skirt. Ransacking the luggage for a replacement Hurley spends the rest of the movie in a schoolgirl miniskirt and a cutoff T-shirt that says ""trailer trash"" - a development thats not entirely unappealing. This movies idea of romantic repartee is having Joe tell Sara who has rejected his advances that ""if Gordon cant tell you how beautiful sexy and wonderful you are then hes an idiot."" While chemistry is probably too strong a term Perry and Hurley seem comfortable together - and Hurleys tendency to try way too hard to be funny in comedies (and take off her top) sort of works in this context. There is also some strenuous mugging by Vincent Pastore - the late Big Pussy of ""The Sopranos"" - as Joes rival process server and Cedric the Entertainer (from ""The Original Kings of Comedy"") as their apoplectic boss. ""Serving Sara"" opens with a bunch of Christmas scenes though the holiday motif is mysteriously dropped midway through. Just as well for a movie being dumped in late August the traditional graveyard for studio mistakes like this one.

Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News You know a movie is DOA when not even the sight of Liz Hurley in a ""Trailer Trash"" glitter T-shirt tartan miniskirt and lace-up python boots can revive it. ""Serving Sara"" is a sad little comedy that starts out in nowheresville and where is there to go from there? It sets out at a slow disjointed crawl and just when you thought it couldnt get any more tedious crabwalks downhill from there. How could any comedy be so boring? Even more mystifying how could ""Serving Sara"" be so dreadful when at the very least it features one actor with decent comic timing (Matthew Perry) and one with an incredibly sexy mischievous sense of fun (Hurley)? Director Reginald Hudlin (""House Party"") and writers Jay Scherick and David Ronn attempt to load the picture up with slapstick hilarity (youll love the part where Perry plunges his plastic-glove-sheathed arm up a bulls rectum) but the excess weight of all that unfunny business only slows the pace down more. Long before ""Serving Sara"" drags its butt to the finish line you wish you were watching a different race. Perry plays Joe a sort of sad-sack wisecracking hipster process server who isnt particularly good at his job. His boss (played by Cedric the Entertainer who with his loud 40s ties and shiny shirts is by far the most entertaining presence in the movie) gives him a crucial assignment Hes got to deliver divorce papers to the beautiful (and very rich) Sara Moore (Hurley) who although she doesnt know it yet is about to be left penniless in the dust by the husband (Bruce Campbell in a role that gives him very little to do) whose business she helped build. Shes surprised enraged and hurt when Joe shoves the documents into her hands and snaps her picture as a record of the jobs completion; before long though she and Joe have joined forces to get revenge on the nasty husband an odyssey that takes them from New York City to a Texas dude ranch. Along the way Sara gets her trouser leg caught in an airport baggage conveyor belt which of course means that the cloth tears away leaving her lacy undies exposed (thats when she trades her upscale duds for the cheap sexy miniskirt outfit); later she ""talks"" her way into a fleabag motel by flashing the proprietor (we see her only from the back). Hurley is a charming and likable comic actress and one whos game for anything She gladly showed us her melons for a great sight gag in ""Austin Powers International Man of Mystery""; and her foxy naughtiness was irresistibly pleasurable in the remake of Peter Cook and Dudley Moores ""Bedazzled."" You Might Also Like But ""Serving Sara"" is an abuse of everything that usually makes Hurley so much fun. She has always been a terrific sport about going along with -- and making the most of -- silly delectably off-color jokes but here shes saddled only with coarse ones that dont make good use of her talents (or her beauty). She and Perry never find an easy natural rhythm. Their scenes together feel so stiffly scripted and awkward that when they finally kiss you cant believe their lips fit together right. Theyre two actors lost in their own movie and in each others arms which spells nothing but disaster in a romantic-caper comedy. Nearly every joke hits with a thud Joe tells his crooked dumb-lug rival process server (played with valiant professionalism by Vincent Pastore) that he ""must have grown up in a house with lots of lead paint."" Its the kind of line that to borrow the playground parlance the movie seems most comfortable with is so funny you forgot to laugh. Sitting through ""Serving Sara"" youre likely to forget over and over again to the point where you cant remember why you bothered to show up in the first place. Its a movie that makes you feel old and enfeebled before your time instead of invigorated. And thats a lousy way to feel anytime but especially in the presence of Liz Hurley flouncing around in a tartan mini. Stephanie Zacharek is a senior writer for Salon Arts amp; Entertainment.

"Serving Sara Does No Service to Anyone Viewers Least of All - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovie Review Serving Sara Does No Service to Anyone Viewers Least of AllUnfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters the Reginald Hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor ethnic slurs.August 23 2002|MANOHLA DARGIS | TIMES STAFF WRITER The crushingly unfunny new comedy ""Serving Sara"" raises the question Can you kill something thats already dead? One of the more cynical and insulting Hollywood offerings in recent memory the film was nominally directed by Reginald Hudlin (best known for ""House Party"") and ostensibly written by Jay Scherick and David Ronn who show either guts or foolishness in keeping their names on this odoriferous mess.In brief the story involves a sneery process server named Joe (Matthew Perry) and the beautiful woman (Elizabeth Hurley as Sara) to whom hes trying to serve divorce papers. Married to a philandering rich Texan (Bruce Campbell) the avenging wife strikes a deal If Joe serves the husband first (a move that will increase the amount of her divorce settlement) Sara will pay him a million-dollar commission.As expected the plan comes equipped with various obstacles including Saras husband and his assorted henchmen as well as Joes aggressively stupid rival (Vincent Pastore) and belligerently short-tempered boss (Cedric the Entertainer). The even bigger obstacles however are the excruciating script and the transparent fact that both the director and his two leads would rather be anywhere but here.In an apparent bid to raise the gross-out stakes Scherick and Ronn pad the bare-bones plot with a surfeit of toilet humor embellishing the stink with a number of moronic ethnic jokes (""Wop-Along Cassidy"") and an interminable scene in which Joe tickles a bulls prostate. The sight of the actor sticking his arm up the animals backside is certainly distasteful but worse yet its not even funny.As with far too many of their peers the writers have taken their gonzo cues from the Farrellys without grasping that what elevates the brothers above the comic crowd isnt just a genius for the grotesque but love for their characters.Of course it helps if there are actual characters in the first place as opposed to ciphers like these.Smiling through the wreckage Hurley recites her lines with unmodulated cheeriness feigning obliviousness to a camera that alternately hovers next to her miniskirt like an overheated dog and narrows its sights on the words ""Trailer Trash"" emblazoned across her T-shirted chest. Meanwhile Perry an agreeable small-screen presence seeking a large-screen future barely registers. Its been widely reported that the ""Friends"" star suffered health problems during production (causing him to exit the set for several months) and although that may explain the listlessness of his performance it cant account for the shoddiness of his material. Its no wonder the actor throws away his lines like a guy tossing out the trash.Hudlin isnt the worst director to work in Hollywood (""House Party"" at least had oomph) but its clear that somewhere along the line on this one he threw in the towel. His setups have all the animation of a dusty museum diorama and he doesnt exhibit an iota of affection for his two leads neither of whom is photographed to advantage. Its instructive that Perry is repeatedly shot from low angles that treble the size of his chin bringing to mind the cruel glee with which John Huston framed Sydney Greenstreets considerable mass in ""The Maltese Falcon.""The directors antipathy for the project would be palpable even if he didnt also give himself an uncredited cameo in which he seems to trash his own movie. When Sara loses her suitcase at an airport she tears open dozens of other suitcases to cobble together a new outfit leaving a mountain of disgorged clothes in her wake. The baggage handler who stumbles in on the damage is Hudlin who after taking one look says ""I aint cleaning it up."" Obviously hes made good on his promise.MPAA guidelines PG-13 for crude humor sexual content and language.
