Starring Freddie Prinze Jr. Chris Kattan Jennifer Love Hewitt Anne Bancroft Val Kilmer Kelly Ripa Eric Idle Michael Clarke Duncan Director Jason Maurer Marc F. Adler Running time 130  Editorial Review Theres a lot of clever visual imagination at work in ""Delgo"" an animated feature from outside Hollywoods mainstream. The battles are boring and the jokes as flat as old 7-Up but the films color palette and creatures -- from teeny buzzing critters to a monster that looks like a giant dust mite -- offer a lot to see. Its just not enough to save the convoluted story. Set in a distant time ""Delgo"" is about two races of beings the winged Nohrin and the earthbound Lockni who have kinetic powers. The Nohrin and Lockni used to live in peace but the Nohrin kings (voice of Louis Gossett Jr.) evil sister (the late Anne Bancroft) started a war. She was exiled but is plotting to start a new war and to take her brothers throne. Unaware of all this are a clever Lockni teen named Delgo (Freddie Prinze Jr.) and a smart Nohrin princess Kyla (Jennifer Love Hewitt). They meet and nearly start a romance but grudges theyve been taught to hold keep souring the mood. Yet when violence breaks out and Kyla is abducted Delgo and pal Filo (Chris Kattan) ally with the honorable Nohrin general Bogardus (Val Kilmer) to save her and stop the war. Although the film may be too violent for kids younger than 10 and too storybook for teens it is a tale of mythic pretensions and can be quite stunning. -- Jane Horwitz (Dec. 12 2008) Contains sequences of fantasy action violence.

ABOUT THE MOVIEDelgo 1/2 (out of four)Voices Freddie Prinze Jr. Jennifer Love Hewitt Anne Bancroft Val Kilmer Michael Clarke Duncan Chris KattanDirectors Marc F. Adler and Jason MaurerDistributor Freestyle ReleasingRating PG for sequences of fantasy action violenceRunning time 1 hour 30 minutesOpens Friday nationwide WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The reptilian creatures great and small that populate Delgo look distressingly like neon-colored computer-animated versions of Star Wars characters. But this noisy and vapid fantasy/futuristic adventure saga bears no other resemblance to those classic movies. TRAILER See a bit of Delgo before you go The land of Jhamora is being attacked on two fronts The Nohrin people a winged species of human rule the skies and the earthbound Lockni harness the lands mystical powers. The odd-looking chartreuse and red Delgo (Freddie Prinze Jr.) goes from reckless to heroic as he forges a forbidden friendship with the sassy Kyla the princess of Nohrin (Jennifer Love Hewitt). Delgo joins forces with the tough Nohrin general Bogardus and seeks counsel from the wise mystic Elder Marley (Michael Clarke Duncan). Hmm. What were the writers smoking when they came up with these names? Hearing the voice of the late Anne Bancroft as Sedessa the exiled empress of Jhamora will be a highlight for adults. Otherwise the story is tedious noisy and banal. It is also rather dark and convoluted for children though it does have the familiar bombast of a video game.

"Delgo An exercise in plot recycling | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentDelgo An exercise in plot recyclingDelgo (the title sounds like a new miracle cleaning agent) is second-rate family entertainment the B-movie of computer-animated features. This flick is like a cheap thriller where the wisecracks always fall flat and the author couldnt be bothered to invent a new plot so he just patches together some old ones.By Susan WalkerEntertainment ReporterFri. Dec. 12 2008 Starring the voices of Freddie Prinze Jr. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Chris Kattan. Written and directed by Marc F. Adler. 90 minutes. At major theatres. PG  Delgo (the title sounds like a new miracle cleaning agent) is second-rate family entertainment the B-movie of computer-animated features. This flick is like a cheap thriller where the wisecracks always fall flat and the author couldnt be bothered to invent a new plot so he just patches together some old ones.Article Continued BelowTake Romeo and Juliet toss in a bit of Star Wars steal some fantasy licks from Lord of the Rings and presto Youve got ""a rebellious boy and his clandestine love for a princess of an opposing race ... stop a war orchestrated by a power-hungry villain.""It makes you wonder why talent such as Eric Idle and Val Kilmer attached themselves to this project.But that is not a question to concern the youngsters for whom Delgo (made by first-time writer/director/producer Marc F. Adler) might have to do until the next Toy Story comes around. In only a slight twist from the standard good vs. evil conflict the villain in this case is a female. Sedessa (voiced by the late Anne Bancroft who did her voice work prior to her 2005 death) is the evil sister of King Zahn (Lou Gossett Jr.) leader of the winged Nohrin people. After murdering her brothers wife she is exiled to some rocky place inhabited by a brutish tribe. (She literally has her wings clipped.) The Lockni people live peacefully and happily in their land. So nice are they they even welcome the Nohrin when their resources disappear and they must colonize the Locknis land. But as the Nohrin take up more and more space tensions rise and Sedessa plots to conquer them both and take power for herself. The set-up is way too convoluted for children and maybe even for the creators of this action fantasy because they introduce story elements that are never explained and are ultimately dropped.Even Delgos hero status is uncertain. Voiced by Freddie Prinze Jr. he is eclipsed in the middle of the film by a Jedi-like character Bogardus (Kilmer) who starts off as a bad guy and dies fighting for the good guys. Delgos goofy sidekick Filo (Chris Kattan) is your off-the-rack cretinous companion who survives to save the day. Idles Spig is one of Sedessas courtiers an over-the-top cockney who mixes up his words as if there was nothing funnier than saying ""Im simply fortified"" when you mean ""Im simply horrified.""Raius (Malcolm MacDowell) strikes us as one villain too many. The designs for the characters and the many weird and reptilian creatures that inhabit these imaginary worlds are intriguing enough. But making the anthropods all flat-nosed and lantern-jawed was a strange choice.Only the princess Kyla has a human face. She looks like a cartoon Jennifer Love Hewitt to whom her voice belongs. The animation is very stilted and gives new meaning to the words ""wooden acting."" When the characters speak they look like puppets. The big battle scenes are instances of the crudest CGI.And dialogue that ranges from the utterly banal (""Does this make my wings look wide?"" says Kyla trying on a new outfit) to the unbearably portentous. (""What you do is honourable if what you believe is honourable"").Anyone lacking a tin ear is going to be hugely irritated by the excruciating soundtrack. .But as long as no one else feels compelled to be original why should the music department?The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Delgo (PG) Fathom (90 min.) Directed by Marc F. Adler and Jason Maurer. With the voices of Jennifer Love Hewitt Freddie Prinze Jr. Opens Friday at theaters in New Jersey. ONE STAR These are the times that try Moms souls. Their little darlings have already seen ""Bolt."" The possible pleasures of Adam Sandlers kid-friendly ""Bedtime Stories"" are still weeks away. So what are mothers -- and fathers and grandparents -- to do with a child desperate to get out and see a new movie? Right now No fear. ""Delgo"" is on the way. On its speedy way to DVD too after an undoubtedly brief stay in theaters. But for those in need of a little entertainment this weeks fantasy epic provides -- well as little as possible with a meandering story some ho-hum action sequences and the sort of characters least likely to become popular action figures. The tale is set in some mythical land inhabited by two-toed lizard folks imperious butterfly people and a large cast of voice actors interested in a quick check. The lizards are peaceful if not particularly bright creatures who seem to worship rocks; the butterflies are upscale upstarts who immigrated then took over. The voice actors range from the undemanding (Jennifer Love Hewitt Freddie Prinze Jr.) to the hungry (Val Kilmer Malcolm McDowell) to the desperate (Burt Reynolds Lou Gossett Jr.) to the deceased (Anne Bancroft). None stands out. Neither does the animation. The lizard people look like extras from ""Alien Nation"" sporting peaceful attitudes and handsome speckled skin; the design of the butterfly people is even less successful (its hard to look bellicose when youre sporting a pair of iridescent wings). Scenery and special effects are merely acceptable. With its ""Romeo and Juliet"" plot (lizard boy Prinze falls for butterfly girl Hewitt) and a late-in-the-game alliance as both peoples join to fight off a new threat the film makes a desperate plea for tolerance. Smart thing too. Its a virtue any ticket buyer over the age of 10 will need to have in abundance. Its difficult to imagine their minor charges will be much happier. There isnt enough action for older children or silly humor for younger ones; even at an hour-and-a-half the film feels padded and its going to feel even slower to audiences amped up on blood-red Icees and molar-cracking Nonpareils. But early December -- like early January and late August -- is one of those dead zones in the kiddie-movie calendar. And the smartest way to survive it is to stay strong resolute and as far away from cut-rate childrens fare as you can manage. Rating note The film contains violence and mild bathroom humor.

""Delgo"" which features a some-star cast (Freddie Prinze Jr. Chris Kattan Burt Reynolds) has been looking for distribution so long that it features Anne Bancroft who has been dead for three years as the wicked ""Sedessa"" who plans to restart the long-simmering feud between her flying race and Delgos kind. To complicate matters Delgo falls for Sedessas compatriot Princess Kyla (Jennifer Love Hewitt). A few magic rocks and tepid battle scenes do little to inspire interest in the goings-on as Malcolm McDowell and Eric Idle spout villainy and punch lines respectively. Running time 88 minutes. Rated PG (mild violence). At the Empire the Battery Park City others.

A boring ungainly piece of animation ""Delgo"" steals from at least a dozen iconic movies and tales for its stilted saga of a young lad saving his gentle people from vengeful baddies. Coal in the stocking looks comparatively better this holiday season which is of note only as the final screen credit for Anne Bancroft. Pic which opened Dec. 12 in limited release should be immediately shunted to vid shelves. Besides Bancroft several name voices were lined up for the project (given Bancrofts death in 2005 the vocal recordings must have occurred at least three years ago) by low-budget outfit Fathom Studios. But the use of Freddie Prinze Jr. Chris Kattan Jennifer Love Hewitt Val Kilmer Malcolm McDowell Michael Clarke Duncan Louis Gossett Jr. Eric Idle Burt Reynolds and narrator Sally Kellerman comes to no real effect since the dialogue is saturated in cliches and the audio recording is strangely muted and eerily disembodied. The tale pits two races -- the aggressive Nohrin blessed with wings and the more peaceable and flightless Lockni -- against each other in a battle over control of land in the territory of Jhamora. Prelude murkily describing the banishment of the evil Nohrin empress Sedessa (Bancroft) to the distant sticks of Perran wont help viewers keep things straight before the action starts in earnest with young Lockni hero Delgo (Prinze) who immediately gets into trouble hanging out with cute Nohrin babe Princess Kyla (Hewitt). Somehow it took six writers including co-directors Marc F. Adler and Jason F. Maurer to fashion a script that lacks a single original thought story idea or gimmick -- all of them borrowed liberally from a library of fantasy fare including ""Star Wars"" ""Lord of the Rings"" and C.S. Lewis. Eventually arrested due to court intrigues staged by Sedessas wily ally Col. Raius (McDowell whose cutting voice is at least reasonably audible and distinctive) Delgo has to join up with a Nohrin opponent Gen. Bogardus (Kilmer) to rescue Kyla whom Sedessa has kidnapped. To add to the far too familiar motifs Delgo has both an obnoxious and verbose sidekick (Kattan) and a New Age guru (Duncan) who teaches the lad the ""way of the stones"" which play a role in Delgos battles against Sedessa and Raius forces. The poorly developed 2-D animation might have been fine during the techniques earliest workshop phases in the 90s but its hardly suitable now. The most glaring warts in the character creation and movement will be a bit less visible in smallscreen video though the consistently poor audio syncing will not. The choppy unfunny four-minute short ""Chroma Chameleon"" is a poor warm-up act preceding the feature.

"Movie review Delgo -- 1 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Delgo -- 1 out of 5 stars Delgo Freestyle Releasing Delgo naps in his tent Delgo naps in his tent (Freestyle Releasing) Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Delgo is yet more proof that not everyone with access to the tools and talent pool to make an animated film should be allowed to. Its a focus-group film from its all-star voice cast ( Jennifer Love Hewitt Burt Reynolds) to its mash-up of a plot and ""cuddly"" critters acting it out.The animations not bad. But the staggeringly complicated Tolkien-C.S. Lewis setting the reptilian leads and the faded fairy-tale plot skewer poor Delgo before we have a chance to figure out whats going on here and why. The title character ( Freddie Prinze Jr.) is a tall thin Lockni lad a mod dinosaurish dude with an inexpressive face and ears that only a Lockni mom could love. He lives in a land where his people invited the homeless winged Nohrin to stay after theyd ruined their own country. Treachery rules the day as the Nohrin decades on the ground seek to seize control over peaceful Jhamora.Hewitt is the winged Nohrin Princess Kyla who is smitten by the boy who cannot fly. Malcolm McDowell and Val Kilmer voice competing generals Chris Kattan and Eric Idle do comic relief with Idle as a limp Mr. Malaprop. ""He seems a tad irrigated."" Michael Clarke Duncan is the Obi Wan who teaches Delgo how to master the magic stones. Did I mention there are magic stones? Never mind.""Connect with the stone Delgo feel its pulse. CONTROL the stones.""The staggering amount of back story doesnt make the climax any more climactic. The winged Nohrin battle the Lockni who mount huge winged dinosaurs whom they ride into combat as the factions fight it out for control of this Dinotopia. Boy dino and girl dino flirt fight and rescue one another from the villains. The late Anne Bancroft (she died in June 2005) voiced the vampy seditious Sedessa who loses her wings in a failed coup but who lives to scheme and vamp another day.With dinosaurs and magic stones and computer animation ""this has everything"" the filmmakers must have declared to potential investors. But if theres a lesson recent Hollywood history has taught us its that not every cut-rate animation that comes along finds an audience and not many of them deserve one.

Then concentrate on the animation. Finally hire good voice actors. Delgo an odd little film about warring races of creatures seems to have worked backwards. The cast includes Freddie Prinze Jr. Chris Kattan Jennifer Love Hewitt the late Anne Bancroft and Val Kilmer. The animation is well done but the story meanders between kid-pleasing slapstick and more serious good-vs.-evil fare. Prinze plays Delgo a Lockni teenager living in Jhamora. He lost his parents in an attack by the Nohrin people winged creatures that rule the skies as they say. A peace exists between the Lockni and the Nohrins but there wont be for long if the evil Sedessa (Bancroft) has her way. Banished by the Nohrins Sedessa has had her wings clipped (literally) and spent years contemplating revenge. A war between the Lockni and the Nohrins is she believes the best way to get it - and to take over Jhamora. Shes helped in this by the traitorous Raius (Malcolm McDowell born to play traitorous villains animated or otherwise). Then theres love - young love which always seems to get people in trouble. This is no exception. Delgo is Romeo to Kylas Juliet. Kyla (Love Hewitt) is a Nohrin princess. Their people hate each other; such a relationship would be a scandal to say the least. Sedessa trumps up charges to have Delgo and his wimpy friend Filo (Kattan as natural in this kind of role as McDowell is in his) jailed. They have to join with a Nohrin Gen. Bogardus (Kilmer) to escape and try to prevent war. Thats a lot of plot to cover none of it particularly original (though the bit with the Lockni people moving stones with their minds or will or whatever is pretty cool). More interesting is the fact that the film is made by Fathom Studios in Atlanta far outside Hollywood. Its a noble thought that CGI films could one day break free of a glorified studio system. And its nice to think that itll play out in some truly independent-minded and not just independently made features down the road. Maybe thats the best way to look at Delgo If nothing else its a start. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Thompson Delgo Makes Great Video Game Fodder Wednesday December 10 2008 at 4 a.m. By Luke Y. Thompson 1 A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Ten years ago the notion of a science-fantasy rendition of Romeo and Juliet starring Freddie Prinze Jr. and Jennifer Love Hewitt might have seemed like a sure-fire moneymaker and the level of CG animation in Delgo might also have looked state-of-the-art. Today few are likely to pay much attention despite a voice cast that also includes Malcolm McDowell Michael Clarke Duncan Val Kilmer Anne Bancroft Eric Idle Burt Reynolds Louis Gossett Jr. . . . oh and Kelly Ripa and Chris Kattan alas. Set in a land called Jhamora Delgo tells the tale of two races hoping to live in peace yet set on the brink of war. One is a race of reptile-people who can move stones with their minds; the other winged sprites who ride dragons (which seems redundant). All appear to have exactly the same face a leftover Gelfling mask from The Dark Crystal that simply gets re-colored ad infinitum. When fairy-like Princess Kyla (Hewitt) saves the life of saurian dork Delgo (Prinze) the two stumble onto a conspiracy by an exiled queen (Bancroft) and treacherous general (McDowell) to conquer both races. Will love save the day? You wont care--more likely youll just wonder why this isnt a video game you can actually play. Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Luke Y.
