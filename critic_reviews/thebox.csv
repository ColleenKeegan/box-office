Considering how long its been since a movies gotten near that part of my stomach thats not an insignificant ""almost. James Marsden and a twangy Cameron Diaz looking like a Pan-Am flight attendant play Arthur and Norma Lewis. A package appears on the doorstep of their 1976 Virginia home. Its a small wooden chest topped with a red game-show button. Not much later a man calling himself Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) arrives with instructions but without a section of his face (he looks like one of those life-size anatomical cutaways).If the Lewises push the button a stranger will die but theyll receive a million dollars. After some deliberation they go for it. The resolve Diaz uses to smack the button is the same used by people hitting the Easy button in those Staples ads. But Kelly could have stamped his button with ""hard. The consequences are strange and brutally inhuman. The Lewises have no idea why suddenly theyre being followed and watched. Neither do we. The movie leaves Norma and Arthur in order to follow their suddenly somnambulant babysitters stroll through some creepy motel called the Galaxy. Theres also a detour for a domestic crime scene across town and doings at NASA which just rejected Arthurs astronaut application. Its all alluringly random. Something ominous is going on and the pleasure of this movie is that we can feel it more than we can entirely understand it.This is a freak-out along the lines of ""Rosemarys Baby ""Dont Look Now ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers or ""The Shining where a directors simple understanding of where to put a camera or when to cut away radically changes how an image affects you. When Arlington tells Norma that he is calling from outside the house theres a cut to man looking into her kitchen window who is not Frank Langella. The camera follows him from window to window as he circles the house. The average commercial horror movie would have found a way to julienne this sequence into a thousand cuts complete with sound effects and inserts of images that have nothing to do with it. Presented the way it is in ""The Box we see what Norma sees and the scene is all the more chilling for it. Theres another creepy entertainingly orchestrated chase through the Boston Public Library - the city stands in for wintry Virginia.Writer and director Richard Kelly drops Isaac Asimovs name and uses Jean-Paul Sartes ""No Exit as an existential jumping off point. He clearly sees his movie as an homage to a particular sort of science-fiction thriller. Every scene emits that ominous 1970s glow in which even the drabbest shots look as if they were filtered through a glass of chardonnay. And the score by Owen Pallet and Arcade Fires Win Butler and Regine Chassagne is both an impersonation of a good horror score and the real thing. Kelly based the film on a 1970 short story by Richard Matheson called ""Button Button which was turned into an episode of ""The Twilight Zone when the series returned in the 1980s.The grim shots of TVs cars houses and buildings suggest ""The Box isnt just a button you push its a depressive philosophy we are weak desperate expendable. (Theres a redundant speech that spells this out.) Theres a fine line the movie says between cosmos and cabal. But Kelly hints at the possibility of spiritual rapture too. Death however it comes is a liberation from the bodily box.Kelly also made ""Donnie Darko and the scandalously misunderstood ""Southland Tales and after three films its fair to call him a paranoia artist. ""The Box is the work of a visionary flirting with commercialism after having so grandly flouted it with ""Southland Tales. He doesnt give in completely. Several trips to the megaplex might be required for ""The Box to make complete sense. (c) Copyright 2009 Globe Newspaper Company.

"Review of ""The Box"" washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Review of ""The Box"" Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday November 6 2009; 1250 PM Between ""Donnie Darko"" ""Southland Tales"" and now ""The Box"" Newport News native Richard Kelly is becoming the cinematic poet laureate of suburban Virginia in all its drab monotony and sneaking sense that somethings going on behind those neat lawns and identical doors. In the case of ""The Box"" Kellys adaptation of a Richard Matheson story the door in question belongs to NASA scientist Arthur Lewis (James Marsden) and his wife Norma (Cameron Diaz) who are snug in their beds one day in 1976 when they receive at said door a mysterious brown-paper-wrapped package. Inside is a box containing yet another box this one with a bright red button. Later theyre visited by a man named Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) whose impeccable manners and soft-spoken erudition can almost make Norma forget that half his face has been demolished. He informs her that if she and Arthur avail themselves of ""the button unit"" someone in the world -- someone they dont know hes quick to add -- will die. They will also receive ""one million dollars"" spoken with a basso profundo gravitas reminiscent of ""Austin Powerss"" Dr. Evil. Fans of ""Donnie Darko"" who were even willing to give Kelly the benefit of the doubt after the ambitious mess that was ""Southland Tales"" will desperately want to like ""The Box"" which he has filmed in a gauzy haze suggesting a dream from which his characters will soon wake up (and like a dream the characters move as if through Karo syrup). With such an evocatively occluded atmosphere as well as references to Mars missions radiation accidents and big-time secrets in Langley ""The Box"" has all the makings of a nifty B-movie a classic throwback to ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" only with feathered haircuts op-art wallpaper and frequent references to Jean-Paul Sartre. Instead Kelly treats what is essentially a Stanford University psychology experiment with inflated somberness and heavy-handed import. ""The Box"" asks the audience to accept as morally complicated the question of whether they would kill someone for a million dollars when most sentient humans would answer ""no"" and move on. Whats more the stakes for Arthur and Norma are risibly low; she needs an operation for a regrettable but not life-threatening condition; he just bought a Corvette he couldnt afford. Gee what to do . . . ? Of course if they take this particular bailout it will give the term ""moral hazard"" a whole new meaning. Diaz and Marsden look attractively worried throughout the nesting choices options riddles and conundrums of ""The Box"" even if Diaz seems mostly to be pooching out her lips and affecting her best butter-wont-melt Southern accent. Langella is far more impressive as the Man Who Stares at Scapegoats which for some reason here are usually women. For a while until extreme silliness and lapses in continuity set in Kelly does a fine job of keeping the audience intrigued and disoriented in just the right proportion. Fans will recognize a few stylistic flourishes from ""Donnie Darko"" but for all the portentous close-ups and bone-rattling hints from a swollen music score ""The Box"" has none of its predecessors strange beauty and enigmatic pull. Rather than a provocative spiritual allegory ""The Box"" arrives on our doorsteps as a sophomorically obvious sermon about greed and altruism. It shouldnt take a rocket scientist to figure out the difference but in Richard Kellys world it does. 1/2 ""The Box"" (116 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for thematic elements some violence and disturbing images.

Almost every description of the film will end up as a spoiler its fairly high concept and it has a few glaring problems. However The Box also presents huge moral dilemmas and is a genuine candidate for ""cult-classic"" status. Im not sure exactly how I feel about it perhaps some amalgamation of confused and captivated. Yes The Box confustivated me. Borrowing from the synopsis What if someone gave you a box containing a button that if pushed would bring you a million dollars ... but simultaneously take the life of someone you dont know? Would you do it? Thats about the size of it. Would you do it? Its a compelling moral conundrum balancing the gain of 1000000 (especially in 1976 Richmond VA) against the inherent value of life even the life of someone you dont know. Cameron Diaz plays the wife in the equation; James Marsden the husband. The offer is made to them by an extremely creepy Frank Langella. And thats problem one with the movie The sense of dread is layered on extremely thick by director Richard Kelly. It almost captures the tone of Unsolved Mysteries a show that could make something innocuous like buying milk at the grocery store seem like certain death. I was recently reading about the specific differences between a mystery and a puzzle and how humans interact with both. A puzzle is an equation that has an answer if you have all the clues at your disposal such as the location of the firehouse nearest to you. A mystery is an evolving problem with multiple possible endings. There isnt a right or wrong answer -- only the answer thats your personal destiny. In that sense The Box is a puzzle that is masquerading as a mystery. Richard Kelly holds all the cards but once you get to the ending you realize it was always going to go a certain way. Theres nothing to ""figure out"" -- the clues are only presented to you to prove a point or instill dread. If you watched The Box a second time you wouldnt gain more knowledge of what was going on and in fact the relatively simple story would be exposed leaving only the questions the piece itself asks. Theres problem two with the film It takes two hours to get anywhere and once you do get there you realize that ""there"" could have been handled in a five-minute scene. So your enjoyment of the movie will come down to whether youre in a ""destination"" or ""journey"" kind of mood. For me the questions raised by The Box as unbalanced and unfair as they are presented were worth the two hours and heavy dose of melodrama it took to get there. We often ask our filmmakers to make choices and innovate and Richard Kelly has done both in big amounts with The Box. Is it an odd film? Certainly. Will it creep you out more than it engages you? Probably. Should we be rewarding folks who are willing to step out of bounds and make us think? Definitely.

But dont panic while its true that the films sci-fi antics are far from watertight in the logic department theres enough eccentricity and ambition at play to charm and bemuse in equal measure. Building on the short story Button Button by The Twilight Zone writer Richard Matheson Kelly whisks us back to late 1970s Virginia. There we meet mid-ranking Nasa scientist Arthur (James Marsden) and his crippled schoolteacher wife Norma (Cameron Diaz below) whom Kelly recruits as two blow-dried lab rats for a deliciously overwrought interplanetary experiment. It begins when Frank Langella (missing a left cheek) knocks on their door drops off a contraption with a red button on it and says that if they push the button theyll receive a million dollars - but someone they dont know will die. Shooting for the technology-driven guilt-racking of Michael Hanekes Hidden - but achieving something closer to the hysteria of the Saw films - Kelly comes unstuck whenever he strains to say something smart. Points too are deducted for mistaking cynicism for satire as in his 2006 folly Southland Tales. Yet Kellys crackpot-inventor approach to filmmaking (note the second-half pile-up of nosebleeding bodysnatchers watery gateways to Hell and sundry Arthur C Clarke quotations) has produced a provocative Lynch-lite paranoia flick that flaunts some fascinating ideas on the destructive power of technology the bourgeois desire for conformity and the potential horrors of parenthood. It also features a great soundtrack by Arcade Fire.

Posted November 6 2009 -- 1200 AM EST Some movies lure you with the promise of dark revelation only to lead you down a rabbit hole of obscurity. For the writer-director Richard Kelly that pattern doesnt represent a miscalculation in filmmaking -- rather its his goal. The Box Kellys latest follows his flaked-out cult nightmare Donnie Darko (2001) and his half-inspired half-cocked apocalyptic satire Southland Tales (2006) and its an even less satisfying mess than they were. Kelly certainly sucks you in though. In this ominous yet vague sci-fi conspiracy thriller set in 1976 in Langley Va. NASA researcher Arthur Lewis (James Marsden) and his wife Norma (Cameron Diaz) receive a mysterious ""gift"" on their doorstep a wooden box with a glassed-in push-button on top. They are then paid a visit by Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) a tall gray-suited espionage type with a hideous burn scar that has eaten away the lower left side of his face. Steward explains the boxs function If Arthur and Norma press that button somewhere on Earth a person they have never met will be killed; they will also receive 1 million. Inevitably they push the button. And just as inevitably the consequences of this selfish (and as the film presents it all but irresistible) act spring forth in ways that they could never have imagined (or wanted). Its no coincidence that The Box plays like the worlds murkiest Twilight Zone episode. Its loosely based on ""Button Button"" a short story by Richard Matheson who wrote some of the series greatest scripts and its got a smashing late-50s/early-60s-flavored musical score that pulsates with Zone-ish film-noir dread. Yet the movie as Kelly has adapted it is also a grandiose paranoid fairy tale full of futuristic motifs that dont lead anywhere except to their own increasingly entangled oddity. Kelly tosses in inexplicable nosebleeds tony references to Sartres No Exit a Cronenbergian theme of bodily disfigurement an army of Body Snatchers zombioids and a watery gateway to the next dimension. None of it quite adds up and by the time the formidable Steward announces ""I am in communication with those who control the lightning"" even Langellas crisply controlled performance begins to seem bonkers. Kelly has talent but for his next movie he might try coming down to earth and forgetting about the people who control the lightning.

By David Denby Ben Foster and Woody Harrelson as soldiers who inform families of war deaths.   Credit Illustration by Yvetta Fedorova In ""The Messenger"" Captain Tony Stone (Woody Harrelson) an Army lifer with a shaved head and a face like a cement block and Staff Sergeant Will Montgomery (Ben Foster) a coiled secretive Iraq-war hero work together in one of the most difficult jobs in the armed services informing parents and spouses that a loved one has been killed. They tell them immediately hard upon the death before the news can appear on the Internet or in the local paper. Messengers? For the families the sternly polite men arriving at the door in bemedalled uniforms and tilted berets seem to be death itself. Theres an excruciatingly obvious but unavoidable irony here ""The Messenger"" has also taken on the unwelcome task of telling its audience what it doesnt much want to hear--how families are devastated by war. Yet the film is neither dutiful nor solemn. This is a fully felt morally alert marvellously acted piece of work. Despite the grim subject its a sweet-tempered movie with moments of explosive humor--an entertainment. The picture was written not by Americans but by two foreign-born men working in Hollywood--Alessandro Camon an Italian and Oren Moverman the director who is a four-year veteran of the Israeli military. If these two missed certain shades of American colloquial speech my ear didnt detect it. The movie is by turns loquacious and raptly silent and Moverman directing for the first time is tremendously talented at handling actors; he gives them the time and the space to work out characters who have layers and corners and shadows. We get to know these men well yet we still think of them as mysterious. Harrelsons Tony Stone has been on death duty for a long time. An alcoholic temporarily on the wagon he may no longer be qualified to do much else in the Army. Harrelson with his eye-popping glare and acetylene voice has often played wild men (most memorably in ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"") but this time the antic aggression is bounded by rules--the Army protocols that keep the Captain functioning. As Harrelson slowly reveals Tony underneath his bristle and bluster is utterly chaotic. Full of useless ribald wisdom about women and relationships hes an ungovernable unmarriageable desperately lonely man who when not working wont stop chattering to young Will. At first Will who is serving out the last three months of his tour while recuperating from wounds has little interest in talking and he looks at the overbearing Tony the way a sea bass looks at a shark. In these opening scenes Ben Foster (from ""310 to Yuma"" and the HBO series ""Six Feet Under"") holds himself back. But this twenty-nine-year-old actor with his melancholy blue eyes and long jaw may be one of the great spellbinders of his generation. When hes silent his face is entirely alive; his eyes seem to be looking inward and outward at the same time. It turns out that theres a lot churning around inside Will. At the beginning of the movie his girlfriend goes to bed with him and then returns to the man she has decided in his absence to marry. And the Sergeant has battlefield griefs of his own which remain hidden for a long time. Alone in his room he goes through violent convulsions throwing his body around in rage which Foster turns into prolonged wordless arias. By degrees he and the filmmakers ease this man back into life. Tony may be unable to survive outside the Army but Will is by nature a civilian. He begins responding to people talking opening himself up to feelings. Tony he realizes is a damaged man but means him no harm and they become quarrelling roistering friends. The Captain starts drinking again and the booze and the mens own kind of mad horseplay get them through the job. Along the way ""The Messenger"" offers one of the most shrewdly perceptive portraits of military men to have appeared in American movies since such classics as ""From Here to Eternity"" and ""The Last Detail."" On the first day of the partnership Tony establishes the drill stick to polite but formal announcements. Dont hug anyone; dont get involved. The movie was shot in suburban New Jersey where the men stiffly approach modest wood-frame houses. They make six calls in all spread throughout the movie and the response to each is different. Disbelief fury violence breakdowns numb acceptance--every emotion that you might expect is there. Watching this of course puts us in a morally ambivalent position our neighbors troubles have been turned into theatre. The way people respond to tragedy has a prurient interest for outsiders but art transcends mere fascination. Moverman doesnt flinch from emotions but he doesnt sensationalize them either and his full-bore sympathy is infinitely superior to a real-life documentary approach which would truly be an invasion. By the end like spectators at a Greek tragedy we feel more like participants than like voyeurs. We want to see more of these people not less. In violation of every Army rule Will becomes attached to Olivia (Samantha Morton) the white widow of an African-American soldier who has a young son. Moverman lets many of the scenes play at length drawing us into the moment-by-moment shifts in mood; the scenes between Harrelson and Foster are all superb but the movies pulse slackens a bit when Morton is allowed to hold the camera too long. Morton was passive and mute in Woody Allens ""Sweet and Lowdown""; she was one of the seers floating in water in Steven Spielbergs ""Minority Report."" Shes a little vague as if she were always floating. Moverman would have done better to cast a more overtly sexual actress--Amy Ryan say or Vera Farmiga. But even this misstep is the product of respect for the characters who need to slowly figure out what to do with their lives. ""The Messenger"" joins the group of strong Iraq-war movies that like rejected suitors stand hat in hand waiting for an audience to notice their virtues. (My canon includes ""In the Valley of Elah"" ""The Hurt Locker"" and the commercially conceived but affecting ""Stop-Loss."") Box-office wisdom holds that its too early to make movies about this conflict but how can it ever be too early to make a good movie? In 2001 the writer-director Richard Kelly who was only twenty-six at the time created ""Donnie Darko"" a near-masterpiece of psychological suspense and apocalyptic mystification which has since become one of the most popular cult films of the past decade. For all its talk of tangent universes and the end of the world and its time funnels swirling through living rooms the movie also gave us an acute satirical impression of a suburban high school and featured a great mischievous performance by a young Jake Gyllenhaal who managed to suggest that his character Donnie was at the same moment both brilliant and completely out of it. Kellys new movie ""The Box"" based on a story by Richard Matheson doesnt come close to ""Donnie Darko"" in psychological interest; its more a supernatural morality tale. The movie is set in 1976 after Viking photographs of Mars raise the possibility that there are ""forces"" out there in the universe. A courtly gent (Frank Langella) in a topcoat and homburg whose face has been partly sheared away by a lightning bolt mysteriously shows up at the house of a NASA engineer (James Marsden) and his schoolteacher wife (Cameron Diaz). He gives them a choice if they push a button inside a small glass dome that he leaves with them they will collect a million dollars in cash but in turn someone they dont know will die. The great Langella soft-voiced and menacing makes this outrageous proposal sound matter-of-fact. Even with his flesh torn away hes a charmer. Is he playing God or the Devil? Needless to say they push the button and not only death but other horrors ensue. Kelly as he did in ""Donnie Darko"" avoids obvious scare techniques. Instead he makes the bizarre the surreal and the frightening emerge from normal reality. The man in the homburg has many employees who look like zombies but theyre not disintegrating pieces of protoplasm--just human beings who seem a little off. Kelly has a tactile feeling for watery surfaces and he works with vast industrial spaces huge research installations that seem to be all metal exoskeleton and eerie white light. He holds us with his extravagant virtuosity and his ability to create suspense through long sequences though the movie is meaningless for anyone with genuine moral curiosity. ""The Box"" turns into a kind of sacrilegious Christian fable; its haunted by God but it delivers a vicious doctrine. At the risk of impoliteness I would suggest that Kelly drop his reliance on religio-mystico-eschatological humbug and embrace in realistic terms the fantastic possibilities in ordinary acts of murder fear heroism and death. If he pulls himself together he could be the next Hitchcock.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

What if you could re ceive 1 million tax-free dollars in cash for killing a stranger simply by pushing a button? If the premise of ""The Box"" sounds like it would make a dandy half-hour TV show rest assured that this Richard Matheson story has already served as a most likely more entertaining 1985 episode of the ""Twilight Zone"" reboot. Writer-director Richard Kelly -- he of the cult hit ""Donnie Darko"" and the dreadful ""Southland Tales"" -- is not terribly successful in fleshing the material out to feature length. After a slightly promising start this great-looking but ultimately deeply confusing and unscary sci-fi/horror opus turns into a quite boring rehash of M. Night Shyamalans post-""Signs"" films. For starters you never quite buy Cameron Diaz and James Marsden as the suburban couple who are offered a box with the death button by a disfigured Mephistophelean stranger (Frank Langella fine as always). The husband is an aspiring astronaut at NASAs Virginia center and shes a teacher with a disfigurement of her own. She needs an operation and they could use the money to pay their teenage sons tuition at a private school. Unfortunately its 1976 and home-equity loans havent yet been invented. So they push the button. Somebody dies. But the husband breaks one of the strangers rules and as the latter puts it ""there are consequences."" All this button-pushing -- and even more extreme if inexplicable tests -- is part of an intergalactic experiment being supervised by the stranger with the help of NASA and the National Security Agency. I may have dozed through the explanation for this cooperation and I didnt really understand the part about why so many characters develop nosebleeds before turning into zombies. There are some nifty water effects and lots of mumbo-jumbo about ""eternal damnation."" When the husband proclaims ""Its a place neither here nor there"" I wasnt sure if he was describing the afterlife or reciting some Led Zeppelin lyrics. It doesnt help that ""The Box"" appears to have been edited with Ron Popeils Chop-O-Matic. Perhaps thats why TV coverage of the July Fourth Bicentennial celebration somehow turns up in a scene set in December.

Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday November 5 2009 715 PM Title The Box A couple makes a potentially deadly choice. With Cameron Diaz James Marsden. Director Richard Kelly (155). PG-13 Violence disturbing images. At area theaters.Some directors it must be said only have one really good movie in them. Were starting to worry that Richard Kelly may be among this select group.Kelly impressed legions of college kids with his 2001 debut ""Donnie Darko."" He followed that edgy cult hit with the disastrous ""Southland Tales"" so his third time out is especially important. And the best to be said is that its not ""Southland Tales.""But ""The Box"" is its own kind of awful a disconnected mess that never finds its reason for being. Based on Richard Mathesons ""Button Button"" a (great) short story that was turned into a (pretty good) ""Twilight Zone"" episode Kellys attempt misses the mark completely. Where the two previous versions were pointedly precise ""The Box"" sprawls sloppily encompassing unexplained aliens a screechy score preposterous special effects and two stars with no idea what theyre doing.As a NASA engineer in 1976 James Marsdens Arthur has been directly involved in a mission to Mars. This may or may not be why a creepy stranger (Frank Langella) delivers the titular gift to his home.Arthurs wife Norma (Cameron Diaz) is given a choice She can pass the box on or push the button inside. If she chooses the latter shell earn 1 million and a stranger will die.Norma takes the bait but its the movie that immediately expires. Rather than ending the story with a punch as Matheson did Kelly wanders aimlessly leaving crater-sized gaps in his wake. All we learn for sure is that women always push the button and their husbands are always loyal and loving enough to forgive them just before theyre cruelly punished for their greed.Its no great reflection on Kelly that Marsden - normally so charismatic - sleepwalks through the movie. But Diaz fares worst of all having chosen (or been instructed) to make vacant idiocy Normas defining trait.So now you have your own choice to consider Spend your time and money on Kellys take or watch the original ""Twilight Zone"" episode at home on YouTube. If only all decisions were this easy. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"The Box - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MysteriesMOVIE REVIEW The BoxToo bad Norma and Arthur didnt leave it on the porch. Richard Kellys latest is no Donnie Darko. The morality tale is fractured foolish and slow as molasses.November 06 2009|BETSY SHARKEY | FILM CRITIC Have you ever actually tried watching paint dry? A sloth walk? Grass grow? You can have all the ""thrills"" with none of the chills courtesy of ""The Box"" the painfully sluggish new sci-fi morality play from ""Donnie Darko"" creator Richard Kelly.Its as if its stars Cameron Diaz and James Marsden as the financially strapped yuppie couple Norma and Arthur were on a continuous prime time-mandated 10-second delay.Think Im exaggerating? Heres an example (with footnotes).Arthur ""Do you know that guy?"" (That would be Frank Langella as the mysterious man in a greatcoat bowler hat and half a face who delivers the ""box"" and its deadly caveats).Now go buy some popcorn. No hurry. Got it? Great.Norma ""No. . . . "" (She adjusts her scarf glances around takes a breath) . . . I dont.""You really expect more from Kelly whose brainy if sometimes unsteady first feature effort gave us the cult sci-fi thriller ""Donnie Darko"" with its great look and clever black comedy cut at suburban life. Kelly usually has the touch when it comes to the subversive but hes gone wildly off course with ""The Box"" and I for one am wildly disappointed but youve probably guessed.Heres the setup. Its 1976 and Arthur and most of the other players in the film are into rocket science a world where high-tech mysteries hang heavy in the air. His dreams of being an astronaut are dashed by two letters of rejection from NASA -- one sent to his work another to his home. Why? As I said there are mysteries here.Meanwhile Norma is a teacher at a pricey private school. Shes got a limp and a reliance on pain pills that make her look like Houses long lost sister. But Normas a trooper because she and Arthur have a very precocious son named Walter (Sam Oz Stone) who theyll do just about anything for a fact that will become significant trust me.Despite her dedication to her students -- she even interrupts her Sartre lecture to show the kids her bum foot after a mouthy one asks -- Norma is about to learn that she will no longer get the tuition discount for her son. Oh my can things get worse?Yes Norma they can. Enter Arlington Steward (Langella) a missing scientist who was famously struck and killed by lightning thus the nasty crater in the left cheek. But surprise hes not dead or is he or is he something else entirely. . . . More mystery.All we know about Arlington (Ari or Al just doesnt quite fit) is that hes the box man dropping it off wrapped in plain brown paper on Arthur and Normas porch. Keep in mind this is pre-9/11 so they dont think twice about picking it up bringing it in and opening it up. Bad move.Heres the catch -- inside is another box this one wooden with a big red button on top that looks as if it was borrowed from ""Family Feud."" Arthur and Norma have 24 hours to press the button or not. If they do they get a million bucks tax-free. The only downside is that someone they dont know will die. Oh well maybe itll be someone very old or very sick -- just the sort of moral arguments they will mull as they try to decide.From here it gets really crazy To wit there are lots of dazed-looking people wandering around getting bloody noses. They live in a motel at night and hang out in a library by day. Maybe to avoid late fees on returned books?There are strange files and microfiche on the very same subject but in different parts of the library. There are three big liquid blobs also in the library that transport you to good or bad places. Meanwhile people in the neighborhood are dropping like flies. Normas really sorry she decided to push that button. Arthurs pretty testy about it too. And Walter hes just a pawn in the game. But a smart new take on weighty moral issues is nowhere to be found.Kelly does some nice things with staging and lighting but really its all for naught because the narrative is so fractured and foolish. What the plot doesnt decimate the films slower-than-a-clogged-drain pacing does. Sadly this is one box thats just not worth picking up off the porch much less opening not even for a million dollars.--betsy.sharkeylatimes.com--The BoxMPAA rating PG-13 for thematic elements some violence and disturbing imagesRunning time 1 hour 55 minutesPlaying In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESAlmost a never-ending taleNovember 14 2007How Sunset Boulevard Got the Whiz-Bang Musical Treatment...December 5 1993Norma Jean Tells Story of an AffairNovember 18 1989MORE STORIES ABOUTMysteriesDonnie DarkoCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-thebox6-2009nov06,0,3846142.story",200,thebox10,thebox,latimes

A man shows up at your door one day carrying a box. On the box is a button. Push the button he tells you and somewhere in the world someone will die. Do you push it? Of course not you think. All right. But suppose the person whod die is someone you dont know. And that the moment they died you got a million dollars. The Box (PG-13) Warner Bros. (116 min.) Directed by Richard Kelly. With Cameron Diaz Frank Langella. James Marsden. Now playing in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys rating THREE STARS Ratings note The film contains violence and disturbing images. Now -- did the question just get harder? That is almost the whole of ""Button Button"" a classic short story by the great Richard Matheson. And Richard Kelly an intriguingly eccentric director has now turned it into a feature film. Hes done that by using Mathesons tale as a jumping-off point. Who is this stranger anyway? What are his motives? And who is the woman who answers the door and her husband and whats their story? Of course the genre genius of Matheson -- the Allendale native whose work has inspired movies from ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" to ""I Am Legend"" -- is that he tells you only what you need to know. There is no padding. Did you ever wonder watching ""Duel"" -- another Matheson story -- what made that truck driver so angry? Or just why that gremlin was tearing up the airplane in the classic ""Twilight Zone"" episode ""Nightmare at 20000 Feet"" -- another one of his? I didnt think so. Yet even as Kelly adds unnecessary detail he takes the story on interesting tangents. Theres a man struck by -- and changed by -- lightning (a nod perhaps to the Matheson story ""One for the Books""). Theres some murky doings at NASA a dose of old Jean-Paul Sartre and lots of groovy sideburns and wallpaper (the story is set in 76). It doesnt all come together -- but then neither did ""Donnie Darko"" Kellys first film a stylish (and sometimes incomprehensible) meditation on fate time travel mental illness and giant demonic rabbits. But still wasnt it fun to try to figure out? (Unlike his follow-up ""Southland Tales"" which never made sense and was an ordeal to sit through.) ""The Box"" is more straightforward than ""Darko"" however -- admittedly not difficult -- and like that film anchored by some strong but subtle performances. Cameron Diaz for example -- as usual better than shes often given credit for -- brings a warmth to the woman who opens the door to temptation. And Frank Langella precise in hat and overcoat is a polite and yet threatening presence as the man with the offer and secrets of his own (and a rather nasty CGI scar). And then there are those small throwaway -- and yet somehow crucial -- details that show a talented director at work. Like the way James Marsden as Diazs husband catches a glimpse of her through a window and falls in love with her all over again. Or the use of an old-fashioned Herrmann-esque score instead of easy pop nostalgia. Ultimately ""The Box"" goes on a little too long and never quite finds the right balance to its storytelling; sometimes it manages to simultaneously tell us too much and keep us confused. But despite its slow stretches its eerily unsettling and apart from some sub-""X-Files"" conspiracies it evokes a peculiar feeling of dread. Its not slick standard sci-fi sure -- and thats a good thing. There are characters here and issues worth arguing over. And whatever his failings a director who clearly knows how to push our buttons.

What button on whose box did Kelly push to get the money to make this awful preposterous thriller? If Hollywood were a three-strikes youre-out kind of place Kelly would be flirting with permanent banishment. His first film cult hit ""Donnie Darko"" was an intriguing foul ball muddled and pretentious but showing signs of a strong talent in search of his voice. His second ""Southland Tales"" was a disaster an unintelligible heap of bombast that was distressing to watch the way it just refused to end. Lifes too short you know? While not as long and overblown as ""Southland Tales"" this third try is just as bad in its way. And how it treats Frank Langella who finally got some cinematic respect with his Academy Award nomination for last years ""Frost/Nixon"" is shameful. ""The Box"" is like a magicians prop It gives the illusion that its full of stuff -- ideas portents clues meaning -- when actually its as empty as the heroines heads in Diazs ""Charlies Angels"" flicks. Writer-director Kelly adapted this mess from Richard Mathesons short story ""Button Button"" previously the basis for an episode of the 1980s TV revival of ""The Twilight Zone."" Advertise Advertise Advertise With its O. Henry-style gotcha ending Mathesons story is perfect for ""The Twilight Zone."" But when Kelly reaches that surprise climax from the short story hes sadly just getting started. Diaz and Marsden play Norma and Arthur Lewis a Virginia couple living a decent life with their young son in 1976. Arthur is a NASA engineer who worked on the Mars Viking landing while Norma is a private-school teacher with a bad Southern accent that comes and goes and a gimpy foot resulting from medical negligence. Just as some financial setbacks hit the family ominous stranger Arlington Steward (Langella stuck with a horrible facial disfigurement from a lightning strike) turns up with the box the button and the deal. The movie then wallows through superficial soul-searching and sermonizing as the Lewises make their choice graduating from a ""Twilight Zone"" episode to an installment of ""The X-Files"" in its post-Mulder death throes when the show turned to rot. Kelly piles on government conspiracies covert abductions an epidemic of nosebleeds mobs of automatons controlled by forces beyond human comprehension quotes from Arthur C. Clarke and Jean-Paul Sartre. And worse still awful 1970s plaid pants. The director and his cast treat all this ridiculousness with such gravity (Diaz bears an unbecoming scowl through almost the entire movie) that the dam thankfully bursts and the hammy dialogue and hammier performances provoke laughs as ""The Box"" shambles toward its overdue demise. Kelly loosely based Norma and Arthur on his own parents -- his dad worked for NASA in Virginia and his mom had a similar foot injury caused by medical malpractice.

Pushing a few of the right buttons and plenty of the wrong ones ""The Box"" reps a dicey mainstream effort by enfant terrible Richard Kelly following the doomed exploits of 2006s ""Southland Tales."" Expanding a Richard Matheson story into a 70s-set thriller in which a couple is besieged by space-age conspiracies nose-bleeding zombies and quotations from Jean-Paul Sartre the pic reveals the hazards of taking ""Twilight Zone"" material too far and too seriously. Still Kellys trademark mix of sci-fi surrealism and suburbia occasionally entertains while Cameron Diaz should carry the cult helmer into more commercial playpens. Warner Bros. release opens Oct. 29 in Australia and bows Nov. 6 Stateside. Mathesons enormous oeuvre has spawned a truckload of films (including the recent ""I Am Legend"") while his short story ""Button Button"" was already adapted into an episode of the 80s reboot of ""The Twilight Zone"" series. Kelly claims to have discovered the tales wicked premise -- a couple is offered a sum of money if they push a button that will kill a complete stranger -- on TV but his adaptation goes way beyond both the teleplay and Mathesons text toward weirder wilder and apparently autobiographical areas. Setting the action -- which takes place entirely in 1976 -- in and around NASAs Langley Research Center and its neighboring Virginian burb Kelly returns to his ""Donnie Darko"" roots by depicting an all-American family succumbing to paranormal forces with several nods to the styles and sounds of the epoch. Had this been the center of the movie rather than an increasingly murky plot that attempts -- via lightweight existentialism and only so-so special effects -- to explain the meaning behind the titular object Kelly might have pulled off the experiment. Instead he widens his scope to cover far too many happenings conspiracies and cultural artifacts while his characters fail to be compelling as they get knocked around by the unknown. Once the box is left on the doorstep of Arthur Lewis (James Marsden) and his wife Norma (Diaz) the film proceeds to explain their motivations for pushing the button. Arthur an inventor responsible for optics on the Mars Landing Program is passed up for a promotion to astronaut. Norma a lit teacher with a (literal) club foot learns that her faculty status will no longer grant their son Walter (Sam Oz Stone) a discount on his private-school tuition. Although these are clearly not the best reasons to kill another person Norma winds up doing the deed and someone across town immediately drops dead. This seems to please the devices ominous creator Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) who dresses snappily to disguise the gaping hole in the side of his face and soon shows up at the Lewises with their 1 million prize. From thereon the couples guilt propels Arthur to investigate the boxs origins and things begin spinning in confusing circles that involve NASA the NSA tales of kidnapped children lots of people with nosebleeds and hordes of zombified civil servants. Meanwhile Stewards antics start to resemble the moralizing ""games"" of ""Saws"" Jigsaw leading to a nasty closing dilemma. Despite the overkill Kelly gains some arresting imagery from his multiple plotlines with d.p. Steven Poster and production designer Alexander Hammond providing a groovy monotone look replete with 70s gadgets and backed by Arcade Fires retro score. A disturbing wedding rehearsal dinner which appears early on highlights Kellys talent for inserting absurd and paranoid elements into seemingly normal events. Performances are characterized by a certain nostalgic stiffness resembling those of the TV shows (""Whats Happening"" ""Alice"") seen in the background that keeps the viewer at a distance. Langellas Steward particularly feels like the product of another era and his diabolical wizard is far from terrifying especially when he starts quoting Sartre. Indeed the French philosophers concept of free choice seems to be one of several themes driving the narrative. But they all feel cobbled together in an effort to show how good Kelly is at thinking out of ""The Box"" when whats really needed is a glimpse inside at something more credible and engaging.
