Pairing a transformed Cuba Gooding Jr. and Fisher favorite Clifton Collins Jr. as morally compromised beat cops enduring a bad day on the streets is just the start of films smart moves. The cop genre receives a shot of adrenaline in helmer Chris Fishers ""Dirty"" a no-nonsense dramatic response to the LAPD Rampart scandals of the 90s. Pairing a transformed Cuba Gooding Jr. and Fisher favorite Clifton Collins Jr. as morally compromised beat cops enduring a bad day on the streets is just the start of films smart moves. By handing theatrical release reins (for spring opening) to exec producer Ash Shahs Silver Nitrate Sony has missed an opportunity to earn serious coin with a pic that should have terrific crossover appeal among multicultural aud niches though studio (which holds vid rights) will enjoy bang-bang ancillary returns. Though it was never conceived as the finale of a trilogy Fishers latest completes a rough and very raw cycle of Los Angeles crime movies starting with true-life serial killer dramas ""Nightstalker"" and ""Hillside Strangler."" While he retains certain touches of shock and horror -- along with a decibel-busting soundtrack -- from earlier pics Fisher takes huge strides forward in ""Dirty"" fashioning a complex morality drama that overshadows films with similar themes from ""Training Day"" and ""Crash"" to ""Dark Blue."" Collins Officer Sancho narrates in classic Los Angeles cop fiction style the story of his dangerous transformation from gangbanger to cop. But on a sunny yet grimy day (brilliantly and seamlessly lensed in smog-stained color by Eliot Rockett and Danny Minnick) Sancho is on the brink of coming clean with LAPDs Internal Affairs department about his involvement in drug-related corruption in his division led by Capt. Spain (Keith David). Sanchos partner Adel (Gooding) so thoroughly corrupt that his upside-down nametag is a symbol of his rottenness has no idea that Sancho is talking to IA cops who are also investigating Sancho for accidentally killing a bystander during a shootout. Spain along with his nefarious Lieutenant (Cole Hauser) view the gang-infested streets as a war zone where any tactic is suitable even if it includes ordering Sancho and Adel to remove a 13-kilo bag of heroin from an evidence room to frame Canadians horning in on the business of drug kingpin Baine (Wyclef Jean). Sancho rightly views the assignment as rife with traps but he cant control Adels urges to harass and abuse civilians from white out-of-towners to Venice homies. For a movie that stays true to its low-budget roots as a decidedly prol genre work ""Dirty"" draws a vast panorama of Los Angeles street life and the similar hierarchies that rule black and Mexican gangs as well as the LAPD. Theres always some higher authority to answer to just as theres always another hidden agenda designed to bushwhack the unsuspecting foot soldiers whether or not they wear a badge. Its this parallel of criminal and law enforcement elements along with its pointed portrait of non-Anglo cop partners on quite different moral paths that distinguishes pic from other recent genre works. Just as a certain fate seemed to hang over the serial killers in his previous thrillers a dark cloud looms over Fishers cops here. This inevitability unfolds with genuinely tragic power not only because of Fishers confidence in his material but also because of Gooding and Collins lusty embrace of their roles. Collins adds to his fascinating gallery of portraits of bad men -- or in this case extremely flawed men -- internally tortured by their actions but Gooding is a revelation. His Adel is a nasty and self-hating cop who has been so undone by what hes witnessed on the beat. Its just the tonic for an actor who has drifted into too many goody-goody roles since ""Jerry Maguire."" Supporting cast is studded with extremely vivid perfs including the always magnetic David in his best role in years Jean in colorful overdrive (and speaking a Jamaican patois thats subtitled) and Robert LaSardo dominating a finale sequence rife with unbearable tension. Pic looks and sounds fabulous with Fisher showing off his love of soundtracks layered with noise quiet and bone-rattling music. Los Angeles is a major star in the film and with no iconic or familiar sights on view its framed as only a local is able to. DirtyProductionA Silver Nitrate Releasing release.

Literally like a place of damnation where all hope is lost and no boundaries separate those sworn to uphold the law from those who break it. Of course because this is movie SoCal and crooked LAPD partners Salim Adel (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and Armando Sancho (Clifton Collins Jr.) patrol streets that have already received memorable lessons in visual style from Training Day Crash and Collateral hell is paved with edgy desaturated colors jittery camera swings nervous flashbacks and fancy image pushing; in this art-designed dystopia every gangsters got style. (Wyclef Jean and the hip-hopper Taboo play kingpins.) But at the end of the antiheroes ropes at the end of writer-director Chris Fishers genre exercise guns have been drawn blood has been spilled cops have been thwarted from going straight and nothing has changed. Thats the real hell of Dirty the sin that damns it to inconsequence Nuthin affects nobody from the gangs running dope to the antigang units brutal street tactics to the top brass (Keith David and Cole Hauser) who simultaneously offer Adel and Sancho protection and set them up. Everythings window dressing. Much is made (at least between themselves) of the fact that the duo in blue consists of ""a bean and a nigger"" -- Sancho himself is a former gang member while Adel is simply an amoral mofo with a taste for boosting the expensive gadgets of the citizens he waylays. (He also sexually molests a female motorist while her male companion looks on helplessly a play of degradation that feels cribbed from the Crash handbook.) But when the florid speeches of volcanic rage and frustration draw to a close -- and when Collins (the memorable Perry Smith in Capote) and Gooding (an actor here reinvigorated by the indie-film chance to hurl obscenities after a run of studio pap) complete their acting exercises -- we still have no clue who these men are and what sent them down their intersecting moral dark alleys. ""This is the day cuz"" Adel assures Sancho the two of them jawing about making one last big splash before getting out of the racket. Nope in the smog of Dirty this is just a day.
