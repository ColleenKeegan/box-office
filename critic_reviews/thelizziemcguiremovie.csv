It seems unlikely that Terri Minsky a consultant for the racy and very adult ""Sex and the City"" could create such a beguiling and entertaining kids show but ""Lizzie McGuire"" formerly called ""Whats Lizzie Thinking"" is a clever and whimsical show that explores the inner child of well a child. The appealing Hilary Duff stars as the title character a 13-year old who struggles to navigate middle school with her friends Gordo (Adam Lamberg) and Miranda (Lalaine). While Lizzie is faced with the usual spate of school conundrums like boys and clothes director Neal Israel gives her myriad visual effects to tell her the story including an animated counterpart who is free to express what the real Lizzie cant. The result is an amusing slice-of-life comedy that deserves a place in primetime instead of a dinnertime spot on Disneys Friday schedule. Premiere episode has Lizzie fretting over school-picture day trying to find the perfect blend of Gwyneth Paltrow sophistication and Sarah Michelle Gellar cool. When her conscientious parents (great tongue-in-cheek performances by Robert Carradine and Hallie Todd) fear she might opt instead for Brittany Spears exhibitionism they make her wear the dreaded unicorn sweater from her grandmother.The sweater sets off an embarrassing chain of events at school making Lizzie the subject of many brutal tauntings. As animated Lizzie explains ""Throughout the animal kingdom its a well-known fact that males fiercely compete to establish themselves within the herd. But in middle school girls get in on the action too."" Writers Tim Maile and Douglas Tuber display an astute ear for the adolescent vernacular but also manage to mix good visual comedy with pop culture references and a savvy subplot about parents who arent easily duped. In fact when Lizzies little brother Matt (Jake Thomas) decides to fake illness to miss a math test savvy mom Jo plays into his farce by force-feeding him borscht and quizzing him with fraction drills. Its a stunt worthy of ""Malcolm in the Middles"" Jane Kaczmarek only without any hint of malice. Tech credits are super and director Israel uses 16mm film digital stills and high-8 video to great effect in Lizzies fantasy sequences and montages. These sequences along with the animated spots by Tapehouse Toons are skillfully edited by Eric Jenkins and set to the appropriate pop beat by Sam Winans. End credits feature the ever-popular outtakes reels which mark a nice finishing touch to such a good-natured show. Lizzie McGuireDisney Channel; Fri.

Disney is giving girls something they want with this mild quasi-romantic romp which should pull a tidy sum theatrically before becoming a homevid fave. A tween sensation many adults are unaware of makes the shift from the small to bigscreen with calculated assuredness with ""The Lizzie McGuire Movie."" A daily attraction on the Disney Channel ""Lizzie McGuire"" has been the biggest thing on cable TV for girls in the 6-to-14 age group for the past three years. With this film and a growing singing career 15-year-old rising star Hilary Duff is moving quickly to fill the kids pop culture space being vacated by Britney Spears. Just two weeks after successfully targeting boys with ""Holes"" Disney is giving girls something they want with this mild quasi-romantic romp which should pull a tidy sum theatrically before becoming a homevid fave. Cute and self-possessed beyond her years Duff has trouble convincing at the outset as a sometimes klutzy girl who makes a fool of herself at her junior high commencement ceremony. But she recovers in time to join a few of her classmates for a two-week tour of Rome which in a uniquely absurd bit of onscreen promotion begins with a nonstop flight from Los Angeles to Rome on Lufthansa Airlines. Successfully arriving in Italy rather than Germany Lizzie and her pals who include bushy-haired best friend Gordo (Alan Lamberg) are under the supervision of the all-seeing martinet Miss Ungermeyer (Alex Borstein). But once dreamy teen popstar Paolo (Yani Gellman) mistakes the blond Lizzie for his dark-haired singing partner/girlfriend Isabella Lizzie begins a game of deception by posing sick each morning then slipping out for rendezvous with Paolo. For a generation thats never heard of ""Three Coins in the Fountain"" or ""Gidget Goes to Rome"" theres the obligatory Trevi Fountain scene a sightseeing tour on Paolos motor scooter and a romantic visit to the Tivoli Gardens where the persuasive young Lothario convinces the apprehensive but dazzled Lizzie to fill in for Isabella at an upcoming music awards show. She left him in the lurch he says because of his desire to pursue a solo career. Meanwhile back home Lizzies upstart little brother Matt (Jake Thomas) is miraculously able to document his sisters association with the Italian rocker via Internet photos and is pushed to cash in on them by an aggressive female friend (Carly Schroeder in a hilariously brash performance). By amusingly pretending he misses his sister Matt convinces his parents (Robert Carradine Hallie Todd) to jet to Italy (airline unknown) to join Lizzie which they manage to do just before shes due to go onstage with Paolo in a big show in the ancient Colosseum. In the meantime Lizzies attempt to fill Isabellas shoes gives the film the excuse to stage an elaborate fashion sequence in which she tries on an array of outlandish designer creations and for Duff to perform a dual role when the girls bond in mutual revenge against Paolo who has deceived them both. Script by TV series exec producer Susan Estelle Jansen Ed Decter and John J. Strauss is clearly designed to get Lizzie out of the house and on her own for the first time as well as to push her into the musical arena. Under the guidance of director Jim Fall (""Trick"") feature is less cutesy and mannered than the TV show but retains certain trappings most notably an animated Lizzie who voices the characters inner fears and thoughts (and already seems like a remnant of an earlier insecure Lizzie who is quickly vanishing). Core cast of family members carries over from TV as do Ashlie Brillault as Lizzies snooty roommate Clayton Snyder as a pre-stoner and Lamberg as the dorky but loyal Gordo whose affection for Lizzie is pushed to the brink of romantic infatuation by the challenge posed by Paolo. Bland-leaning proceedings are nicely spiked at times by the broadly comic turn delivered by ""MAD TV"" regular Borstein whose formidable character missed her obvious military calling but who emerges as an endearing figure in a ""Shrek""-like kind of way. The Canadian Gellman is entirely convincing as a Latin teeny-bopper heartthrob. As for Duff most recently in ""Agent Cody Banks"" she still falls back too often on a winsomely pained look whenever adversity presents itself and her Italian impersonation as Isabella might just pass muster in a high school play. But shes got the looks and unquestioning self-possession that are highly valued as commercial commodities and the subdued trashiness of her wardrobe in the final concert extravaganza announces she is aiming for Spears-like status with pubescent girls -- the difference between the two being Duffs primary emphasis on acting (shes got a couple of big mainstream movies in the works). Made on a budget pic takes touristy advantage of the Roman locations although they look somewhat dark and grainy in Jerzy Zielinskis lensing.

Rob McEwan / The Chronicle Lizzie (Hilary Duff pictured) cant even sing alone in her room  how is she going to sing for millions in ""The Lizzie McGuire Movie"" on 4/8/03 in . Rob McEwan / The Chronicle Photo Rob McEwan Girls in a tizzy over Lizzie / New movie presses all the buttons for 6-to-14 set 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Lizzie McGuire Movie Teen comedy. Starring Hilary Duff Adam Lamberg and Robert Carradine. Directed by Jim Fall. Written by Susan Estelle Jansen. (PG 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). Lets get this out of the way right off the bat. If you have an 11-year-old girl in your house you will be going to this movie. Deal with it. The backdrop for ""The Lizzie McGuire Movie"" is the wildly popular Disney TV sitcom also named after the star character. ""Lizzie McGuire"" is must-see after-school viewing for virtually every kid demographic between ""Barney"" and ""MTV Cribs."" It is No. 1 on basic cable among 6-11 kids 6-11 girls 9-14 ""tweens"" and 9-14 girls. In short it is a runaway marketing freight train. Thats the bad news. The good news is for what it aspires to be -- and were not talking ""Sense and Sensibility"" here -- it works. ""Lizzie"" is wholesome smart and sweet. But she is not so cute that she cant pull one over on the clueless adults or sneak away for an honest-to-goodness date or even -- oh my God -- a real eyes-closed kiss. The ""Lizzie"" concept is that no one seems to realize that Hilary Duff playing the lead is the cutest most vivacious and most . . . er . . . statuesque girl in middle school. Every once in a while she threatens to break out and become a star but about that time she suffers another of her unfortunate pratfalls. (Lizzie stumbles and hits the deck so often you wonder if she doesnt have some kind of inner-ear disorder.) Lizzies concerns boil down to those three critical questions for middle-school girls What to wear? What to say? And is everyone looking at me? Shes pretty but doubts herself. Her parents love her but as hard as they try they are utter nimrods. (In one scene Dad played by Robert Carradine is sitting at the kitchen table blissfully painting a lawn gnome.) Her friends are great but the snobby cool kids are always there to undermine her confidence. In the movie Lizzie and her pals get a trip to Italy where -- who would have guessed? -- Lizzie turns out to be a dead ringer for an Italian pop star Isabella (also played by Duff). And Isabellas partner the hunky Paolo (Yani Gellman) happens to spot Lizzie and wants her to be a stand-in for a huge televised performance at the Roman Colosseum. Hey that could totally happen OK? Duff is just about to become either a breakout star or overexposed but we catch her here in the delicate balance between the two. Shes bright and confident like Melanie Griffith after she went to see the wizard. As Lizzie she is utterly and absolutely astounded by everything she sees the Colosseum the gelato and Paolo who shows up on a cute red Vespa to show her the sights. ""Are you sure you know how to drive this thing?"" Lizzie asks. ""This is Rome"" Paolo replies. ""Nobody knows how to drive."" Thats the films saving grace. Although it is a star turn for Duff theres more. The script (by ""Lizzie McGuire"" veteran and ""Boy Meets World"" writer Susan Estelle Jansen) is clever and the stellar supporting cast gets a chance to bang a few punch lines too. An excellent example is Jody Racicot as Giorgio the hotel desk clerk who does a great surreal riff on his lines. Or Alex Borstein who wrings some nice laughs out of a stock character -- the drill sergeant principal Miss Ungermeyer. Even Lizzies dim-bulb pal Ethan (Clayton Snyder) who wants to know whether the hotel room numbers are ""in English or Italian"" has his moments. But this film is still going to stand or fall on Duffs appeal. She looks a little old for 15 frankly but her exuberance -- she turns a cartwheel when things go well -- carries it off. Shes got all the fashions and accessories -- a ""Lizzie McGuire"" clothing line is on the way -- for the girls but shes sweet and innocent enough that parents will approve. At this moment in time Lizzie McGuire is the perfect middle school icon. May she never get a tattoo. Todays Deals New amp; Refurb Portable Speakers at TechRabbit Up to 80% off...

Of course it is not a sequel to that Tom Cruise film. And its not for those who liked Jerry-- or any other movie with a credible plot interesting characters or sharp dialogue. Yani Gellman and Hilary Duff star in Lizzie McGuire in which our heroine gets the guy a cool singing gig and great clothes. Having said that kids will love it. Lizzie McGuire stars Hilary Duff the effervescent blonde of the Disney Channel show of the same name and is meant to take up where the cable series left off. (The series finished shooting last year but is still on the air.) Unfortunately the series which chronicles the adventures of clumsy middle-schooler Lizzie has more inspired moments than the movie. Both place animated snippets amid live action but the movie doesnt sufficiently exploit the clever potential of that technique. Primarily its the oh-so-obvious story that makes Lizzie so silly. The filmmakers must have figured that because Duff is so cute and lovable a compelling plot wasnt needed. Or that kids just love her character so much theyll go see anything with her in it. Lizzie has one of her signature klutzy moments at her eighth-grade graduation ceremony but soon after she and a handful of classmates are seeking la dolce vita on a school-sponsored trip to Rome. Yes you have to suspend your disbelief from the start Who knew middle-school graduation merited such a reward? Once in Italy Lizzie is mistaken for Isabella a teeny-bopper pop star. Faster than you can say ""Buongiorno"" the stars handsome singing partner Paolo (Yani Gellman) puts the moves on her in a ridiculously bad Italian accent. Lizzie falls for Paolo abandoning her longtime pal Gordo (David Zephyr who is one of the few to give a credible performance). Lizzies only just out of eighth grade but shes tooling all over Rome on the back of Paolos moped and planning to impersonate Isabella for a stint at an international video awards show. Lizzie is supposed to be transformed from awkward adolescent to beautiful star but she merely goes from stylish and adorable to even more adorable culminating in every young girls dream of singing and dancing in gorgeous clothes before a huge audience. The movie is sure to appeal to fans of the show. But when quality family films such as Holes and Bend It Like Beckham are also in theaters why waste your time on this drivel? The answer of course is the kids will insist on it. But theyd be better off just turning on the TV.

But that hasnt tarnished her comeback-kid cred among the six-and-ups who faithfully follow her Disney Channel show - and it doesnt make The Lizzie McGuire Movie a clever agreeably weightless theatrical outing any less enjoyable. On a class trip to Rome (where the locals and the location photography are suitably bella) Lizzie is mistaken for an Italian teen diva sparking a spasm of girlish wish fulfillment.
