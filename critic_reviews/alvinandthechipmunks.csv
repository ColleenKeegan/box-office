This live action version sees the computer-generated furry trio Alvin Simon and Theodore wind up in LA when their tree is felled for Christmas. Not so much innocents abroad as sussed little mammals who speak like urban teens they become the toast of the town thanks to their vocal talents. The musical numbers are initially appealing - think close harmonies and smart foot stepping to the likes of Funkytown - but the novelty is likely to wear thin for adults when the munks get kitted out as a street boy band. Jason Lee pratfalls away amusingly enough as the songwriter who becomes the boys reluctant father figure and his wry approach lends an edge to some of the scripts wittier moments. But the storys downhill slide into a hypocritical rant about commerce and the music industry does it no favours.

"Alvin and the Chipmunks Blast from past | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesAlvin and the Chipmunks Blast from past You gotta love those chipmunks. The adorable pantless rodents made their first recording in 1958 when Ross Bagdasarian wrote ""The Chipmunk Song"" for them.By Susan WalkerENTERTAINMENT REPORTERFri. Dec. 14 2007 Starring Jason Lee Cameron Richardson and David Cross. Directed by Tim Hill. Written by Jon Vitti and Will McRobb. 90 minutes. At major theatres. G  You gotta love those chipmunks. The adorable pantless rodents made their first recording in 1958 when Ross Bagdasarian wrote ""The Chipmunk Song"" for them.Article Continued BelowThe Christmas novelty track - recorded voices were sped up to sound like kids on helium - was No. 1 with a bullet. Then in 1983 the little guys made a comeback bursting into animated life as a Saturday morning cartoon. Now the furry moppets are headed for boffo box office in a motion picture with real live humans. The big screen is the right medium for this trio. Through the magic of CGI theyre more adorable than ever the cutest boy band since the Jackson 5. Jason Lee (My Name is Earl) fits the part of Dave well. Hes a hapless guy like Earl. When three chipmunks with anthropomorphic ambitions move into his townhouse Daves dull life is overturned. But after he writes ""The Chipmunk Song"" for them Dave begins to see a future for himself in the music biz. In their new hip hop-styled incarnations Alvin Theodore and Simon are mischievous tykes rebellious teens and self-centred bratty pop stars all rolled into one furry package.Once a sleazy record exec named Ian (David Cross) gets his hands on them the munks as he calls them are no better than their hamster cousins on the treadmill. Theyre enslaved to the record company. Long-time munks fans will be pleased to see that Alvin is still reckless a self-styled ""artiste."" Theodore is the innocent. Simon wears designer glasses now but hes as smart as ever. The plot is predictable (cutthroat entertainment business spoils the talent) but the entertaining antics never end and the writers resort to only one poo joke (concerning the nature of raisins on the breakfast table).Not just a movie but a merchandising opportunity Alvin and the Chipmunks boasts a lavish soundtrack (including Chipmunk classics such as ""Witch Doctor"" and ""Funkytown"") hoodies and an assortment of toys for the Christmas tree.

"Singing the Same Old Song washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Singing the Same Old Song Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints Friday December 14 2007 ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" has been around since 1958 when Ross Bagdasarian Sr. had a huge hit with ""The Chipmunk Song."" Bagdasarian was able to use his voice and recording tricks to spin this mild fantasy into a cash cow now tended by his son (the old man died in 1972) Ross Jr. one of the producers of the new ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" film. I suppose the justification for this iteration of the now-familiar tale of mild-mannered songwriter Dave Seville who becomes father to Alvin and his buddies Simon and Diseased Scurvy Rodent -- oh sorry folks I mean Theodore -- is new computer technologies. So this film features what look like living plush toys. (It also features authentic human being Jason Lees excessively mild posturing as Dave and David Crosss hammy over-acting as the record exec who wants to corrupt the boys; Cross is reportedly human as well.) Compared with the wonders in ""Beowulf"" and ""The Golden Compass"" this film isnt much. But youngsters who love the shrieky singing and dont notice the tapioca of the story will probably get their moneys worth. Parents Bring earplugs. -- Stephen Hunter Alvin and the Chipmunks PG 91 minutes Contains mildly rude humor. Area theaters. Alvin and the Chipmunks PG 91 minutes Contains mildly rude humor.

Theodore Alvin and Simon are disappointed with the Christmas gifts presented by Dave Seville. Photo Photo Credit Rhythm amp; Hues Review Alvin and the Chipmunks get a 21st century update 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Alvin and the Chipmunks Comedy. Starring Jason Lee David Cross and Cameron Richardson. Directed by Tim Hill. (PG. 92 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" is a movie that features a cartoon rodent eating his brothers feces and do you really need to know more about this update of Ross Bagdasarians iconic musical creation? How about this It was directed by the guy responsible for ""Garfield A Tail of Two Kitties."" The news mostly gets better from there. The writing in this live-action comedy (with animated chipmunks) is much sharper than either of the ""Garfield"" movies which ""Alvin"" resembles visually. And actors Jason Lee and David Cross put a lot more effort into their roles than the subject matter deserves. But theres still something mildly distressing about the production which gets worse the more you think about it. Between the occasional amusing joke and catchy musical number this ""Alvin"" update is a very soulless movie. In many ways that sums up the current state of childrens cinema. Defecation and flatulence jokes are included as if theres a congressional mandate and any morals or inspirational themes are optional. No one in ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" learns any lesson; the characters just react to a series of misunderstandings usually by running away from the problem. The movie is at best empty calories - the cinematic equivalent of a bowl of Lucky Charms. Speaking of which that sugary breakfast cereal is actually pretty symbolic of the biggest problem with ""Alvin and the Chipmunks."" In the film the singing chipmunks and their human friend Dave (Lee) fight against attempts to commercialize their music which include talking chipmunk dolls and other junky marketing tie-ins. At the same time the movie bombards the viewer with product placement for Lucky Charms Campbells Soup Pepperidge Farm cookies Crayola crayons the Bob Dylan album ""Time out of Mind"" and a handful of toys I didnt recognize. The chipmunks even have a purposeless scene in a grocery store - another chance to give more screen time for the frozen waffle industry. The plot of the movie mirrors the themes of the music albums that Bagdasarian started making in the 1950s which were followed in the 60s and 80s by a few animated TV series. Dave is once again a struggling songwriter who discovers the chipmunks and they help him write the hit ""The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Dont Be Late)."" From there the story takes a 21st century turn complete with a hip-hop version of ""The Witch Doctor"" that features a Britney concert with dancing hussies in the background. Theres also a romance with a neighbor thats almost identical to the one in ""Garfield."" The chipmunks also cover a few modern songs including ""Dont Cha"" by the Pussycat Dolls. (Sample lyric ""Dont you wish your girlfriend was a freak like me?"") Thankfully thats about the worst that ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" has to offer. The movie doesnt have much substance but there are a few funny moments. The writers include ""The Simpsons"" veteran Jon Vitti and ""The Ren amp; Stimpy Show"" contributor Will McRobb and they make Lee appropriately likable while Cross is a sarcastic and clever record executive villain. And not all of the sight gags involve bodily functions Theres a nice scene that makes fun of big stars who lip-synch. Be sure to stick around after the credits where Cross contributes to the biggest laugh of the movie. Or better yet take your kids to the superior ""Mr. Magoriums Wonder Emporium"" and time your multiplex visit carefully so you can catch the last five minutes of ""Alvin."" -- Advisory This film contains some rude humor and songs with sexually suggestive lyrics. Watching ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" may also lead to your children digging out a record player and speeding up your old Rush albums to 45 revolutions per minute - which actually might improve ""Presto."" ) Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 3 7-year-old girl dies after elephant at zoo throws a rock at her 4 Bikini-clad Swedish cop makes arrest while sunbathing 5 Clinton speech draws mixed reaction on cable news 6 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 7 Trump Jr. accuses Obama of plagiarizing a line from his speech 8 The Latest Trump slams Clinton over radical Islam 9 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 10 Man beaten unconscious in SF confrontation over urination Find Showtimes Search Theaters amp; Showtimes -- County -- Alameda Contra Costa Lake Marin Napa San Francisco San Mateo Santa Clara Solano Sonoma Show Movies Now Playing | Recent Releases | Critics Favorites Rated G | PG | PG-13 | R Latest News Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed Apple CEO Tim Cook hosting fundraiser for Hillary Clinton E.

Jason Lee - minus his ""My Name Is Earl"" facial hair - more than earns his salary mugging and pratfalling without pause as a struggling songwriter who befriends the mischievous CGI-rendered singing and talking chipmunks. The paper-thin plot has them seduced away from his custody by a greedy record producer (David Cross) who for some creepy reason keeps offering them massages. ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" pretends to rail against commercialism at the same time it assaults helpless kids with too many product plugs to count. For adults its like being hit over the head with a mallet every 10 seconds for 90 minutes. Two days later I still had a headache. Running time 90 minutes. Rated PG (poop jokes).

Elizabeth Weitzman Tuesday June 3 2008 320 PM Alvin and the Chipmunks. Family film about a failing songwriter who meets three musical chipmunks. With Jason Lee David Cross. Director Tim Hill (132). PG Crude humor. At area theaters. Lets say youre Jason Lee. Youve slogged away for years in a movie career that never quite took off. Then you hit it big on TV with ""My Name Is Earl."" Naturally you capitalize on your success by making a new film with ... computer-animated chipmunks?If karma exists ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" must be Lees punishment for appearing in the likes of ""Jersey Girl."" Even Bill Murray was smart enough to stay offscreen when he supplied the voice for Garfield. And yet here Lee is looking suitably ashamed to be playing opposite three CGI animals with really annoying voices. Director Tim Hill has updated the characters Ross Bagdasarian created in 1958 while starting the story from scratch. Lees Dave is a sadsack songwriter living in L.A. His producer Ian (David Cross) hates his work and his girlfriend Claire (a bland Cameron Richardson) has dumped him. Just as hes ready to give up all hope he hears scurrying in his kitchen where he finds Alvin (voiced by Justin Long) Theodore (Jesse McCartney) and Simon (Matthew Gray Gubler). Much to his surprise these cheeky chipmunks can not only talk they sing. Before long his new pets have made themselves at home keeping a lonely Dave company for Christmas and performing his songs for Ian. Unfortunately the ultra-sleazy Ian sees dollar signs in each of their tiny eyes. So he drapes them in bling sends them on tour and works them until theyre ready to drop. Even worse he cuts a worried and protective Dave out of the picture. Will the chipmunks survive life on the road? Will Dave rescue them from Ians greedy clutches before the damage is done? Oh come on. Do you really care? And even if you do you shouldnt. Lee doesnt. Hill - who made the equally lazy ""Garfield A Tail of Two Kitties"" - doesnt. Our only laughs come from Cross who remains remarkably enthusiastic throughout. Or maybe hes just amused that unlike us hes actually getting something out of his end of the deal. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

You could hear the sleigh bells and cash registers ringing. That was 1958. The Chipmunks - troublemaker Alvin bespectacled brainiac Simon and chubby-cheeked Theodore - are back this time CGI-animated in Alvin and the Chipmunks a diversion for 6-year-olds and their babysitters. Starring Jason Lee (My Name Is Earl) as Dave Seville a struggling songwriter who discovers the harmonizing rodents Alvin takes satiric aim at the music industry. (Seville is the stage name of Ross Bagdasarian Sr. the novelty songwriter who sped up playback to create the Chipmunks high-pitched voices.) In the movie the chipmunks enter Daves life - and invade his bungalow - on the day hes been ditched by his girl and rejected by a recording industry exec Ian (David Cross). When Dave recognizes the ""boys"" have musical chops Ian signs them. Dave sets limits for these adopted sons. But Ian gives them mountains of toys and candy to win their loyalty - and exploit them for every penny this furry version of N Sync can bring in. Dave cares about the health and welfare of the boy group voiced by Justin Long Jesse McCartney and Matthew Gray Gubler and doesnt like the way Ian is retooling his ""sons"" into hip-hop bad boys with silver-lame jumpsuits and designer sneakers. Ultimately the values and the CGI are good but the acting is broad and the chipmunks arent really differentiated. What happened to Alvin the rodent counterpart of Dennis the Menace? Was he declawed in the translation to CGI? Alvin and the Chipmunks  Directed by Tim Hill written by Jon Vitti Will McRobb and Chris Viscardi.

More than hyperactive enough to engage small fry with microscopic attention spans ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" also has built-in nostalgia appeal for baby-boomer parents and grandparents willing to accept 21st-century remixes of novelty songs and cartoon characters from the 1950s and 60s. This latest mash-up of live-action comedy and CGI shenanigans from helmer Tim Hill (""Garfield A Tale of Two Kitties"") is a harmless and frequently humorous trifle that might be a potent B.O. performer if only by default during a holiday season surprisingly short on kidpics. Homevid prospects are huge. Title characters date back to 1958 when the late musician-songwriter Ross Bagdasarian used then-state-of-the-art recording technology to create high-speed high-pitched vocals for the chart-topping hits ""Witch Doctor"" and ""The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Dont Be Late)."" (Pic acknowledges that wonderful year with a long-held shot on a street address.) The specific personalities of the chipmunk siblings -- spunky Alvin brainy Simon and sweetly goofy Theodore -- and their often-exasperated human father figure Dave Seville were more or less solidified in ""The Alvin Show"" a 1961-62 animated TV series (in which all four central characters were voiced by Bagdasarian) the template for all things Alvin and/or Chipmunk ever since. New pic is the chipmunkish equivalent of ""Batman Begins"" re-imagining the mythos while re-introducing Alvin (voiced by Justin Long) Simon (Matthew Gray Gubler) and Theodore (Jesse McCartney) as madcap forest denizens involuntarily relocated to Los Angeles. They arrive in the right place at the right time -- on the upper branches of a Christmas tree in the lobby of Jett Records world headquarters -- just as struggling songwriter Dave Seville (Jason Lee) once again fails to sell a tune to his increasingly impatient former college roommate Jett executive Ian Hawk (David Cross). Judging from what the aud gets to hear Ian is altogether justified when he suggests Dave might consider a new line of work. But with talking and singing chipmunks to inspire him -- that is when the furry sprites arent laying waste to his apartment or undermining his romance of comely neighbor Claire (Cameron Richardson) -- Dave manages to compose and record a potential No. 1 hit. Daves career advancement is temporarily impeded when in a plot turn that recalls the classic Chuck Jones cartoon ""One Froggy Evening"" Alvin and his siblings are unable to perform for anyone but Dave. The chipmunks however overcome their stage fright which leads to fame fortune and their resultant problems. Working from a script by Jon Vitti Will McRobb and Chris Viscardi Hill is less than subtle as he emphasizes themes of family values and paternal responsibility. It doesnt help that as Lee gives an atypically bland performance as the straight-laced Dave Cross grabs every scene that isnt bolted to the floor as the shamelessly materialistic and exuberantly snarky Ian. (Early on Ian looks at the rodent superstars and cracks wise ""Put some clothes on those guys. Its kind of embarrassing."") Virtue ultimately triumphs of course but until Ian starts behaving in an flagrantly nasty fashion -- and maybe even for a while afterward -- grade-schoolers in the aud likely will think that hey the libertine is a lot more fun that the party-pooper. By this point in the development of f/x trickery its not exactly startling to see that ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" offers a seamless juxtaposition of live-action and computer-generated elements. But to give credit where its most certainly due the pic benefits greatly from the persuasive interaction of human and digital co-stars. Lively hip-hop and techno-pop versions of Chipmunk standards only add to the fun. Closing credits are cleverly illustrated with album covers that chart the decades-long development of Alvin and the Chipmunks as musical icons.

Kidding. Its a fine-enough kids movie. Cute. Nice lesson. And better than youd think. Thats because for all the animated chipmunks and sped-up celebrity voices and Jason Lee and whatnot Alvin and the Chipmunks has what every movie needs a good bad guy. David Cross brings a delightfully despicable tone to Ian a nefarious record-company executive. Unlike everyone else when Ian sees Alvin and friends he doesnt see the furry little pals who can warble a tune. He sees a cash cow one he plans to milk for all its worth. Cross is hilarious in everything he does but hes surprisingly effective in a kids comedy. His villainy is so broad that its never really scary and hes so funny that you never tire of seeing him on-screen. If youre familiar with the old Alvin cartoons you know the premise three talking chipmunks befriend Dave a songwriter - Lee in loveable-loser mode kind of a kids version of his role in My Name Is Earl - who writes music for them. Turns out that in addition to eating their way through Daves house and wrecking his furniture career and life they can harmonize too. Justin Long provides Alvins voice Matthew Gray Gubler Simons. Which would be great if you could recognize them. Disney fans will love that Theodore is voiced by Jesse McCartney for instance but with his voice so sped up and altered its impossible to recognize him. Dave pens a hit for the chipmunks which is where Ian comes in. This is 2007 not the early 60s. Cant have a movie even a kids movie without a little corporate greed thrown in to root against. Ian is an old friend of Dave though he has had much more success - something he isnt shy about reminding Dave of. From there its a predictable story. Dave wants whats good for the chipmunks Ian wants whats good for Ian. If that means working the little critters nearly to death so be it. Guess who wins out in the end? Theres also a bit of romance mixed in with the chipmunks trying to help Dave win back Claire (Cameron Richardson) his former girlfriend. If you can stand the voices the songs are catchy and some of the videos and marketing that Ian devises to sell more product are funny (or at least cute). They dont quite rise to the level of corporate satire but this isnt really the audience for that anyway. The audience for Alvin and the Chipmunks is there for the songs the silly comedy the cute talking animals. All of thats there in large doses. Adding Cross to the mix is what makes it OK for the rest of us. Reach the writer at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Read his blog and comment at goodyblog.azcentral.com.
