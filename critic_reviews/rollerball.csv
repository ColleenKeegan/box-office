Share Tweet High concept executed with high seriousness 1975s Rollerball presented a vision of the future that might have come from Noam Chomsky rather than William Harrison author of the original story and screenplay Corporate interests rule every aspect of society keeping the masses distracted with the wildly popular violent titular sport. Directed with probably too much somberness by Norman Jewison the film wasnt wholly successful but its attempts to use violence to provoke thought rather than dull it have aged nicely over the years as have its themes. This long-delayed remake directed by John McTiernan (Die Hard Predator Last Action Hero) seems almost like an apology for the original paying lip service to its predecessors concerns while piling one nonsensical aggressively stupid action scene atop another. The usually charming Chris Klein whose presence here is reduced to stiff Keanu-isms stars as an aspiring hockey star who runs afoul of the law by indulging in extreme sports on the streets of San Francisco. Prompted by pal LL Cool J he travels to a corrupt impoverished Central Asian country where rollerball is king. The sport which proves even more confusing than Harry Potters Quidditch matches combines rollerblading motorcycling field hockey and the pageantry of the WWF in one unpalatable stew adored by local miners and television audiences alike. Quickly ascending to stardom Klein lives as high a life as possible in the rural wastes of his new home where hes pampered by powerful corporate overlord Jean Reno (who seems to have a grand time letting a silly mustache a flashy fur coat and a Boris Badenov accent do the acting for him). When Klein Cool J and mysterious biker Rebecca Romijn-Stamos begin to suspect that Reno has begun tampering with the game to make it more violent for the sake of ratings--measured in a digital counter marked ""Global Rating""--theyre forced to fight for their lives. Rollerball was reportedly tampered with extensively over the months since its planned release last summer and the signs that its been edited past the point of comprehensibility arrive early. Before the movies first match Cool J turns to Klein and asks ""You got your armadillo on?"" The comment makes sense eventually but it initially sounds jarringly bizarre. Elsewhere there are numerous signs that the film has been trimmed to fit within PG-13-friendly parameters including a sex scene with the phoniest digital masking since Eyes Wide Shut and action that confusingly cuts away from the moment of violence. Not that a decent film could have been salvaged from this footage A lengthy sequence shot as if seen through a pair of green-tinted night-vision goggles is only the most puzzling of many puzzling choices. At one point a character intones ""The integrity of the game must be maintained"" while watching flamboyantly costumed rollerballers engaging in a chaotic battle royal on the floor. Its all business as usual in the world of rollerball and Rollerball. Only those attracted to Waterworld- or Last Action Hero-level big-budget disasters need bother with this one.

Rollerball remake a bust | Online Athens Toggle navigation Home News Local Blotter Sports Weather Obits Classifieds Classifieds Local Jobs Autos Real Estate Search Rollerball remake a bust Film review Posted Friday February 08 2002 By David GermainAssociated Press The wheel always seemed like a great invention until the remake of Rollerball came rattling along. Photos Loud crude and outlandish Rollerball is a parody of itself a frenzy of extreme-sports stunts masquerading as social commentary on violence and the corporate forces that feed off it. Director John McTiernan has done fine service in the action and thrillers genre in the past with Die Hard The Hunt for Red October and the remake of The Thomas Crown Affair. It would be nice to place blame for this awful movie elsewhere perhaps with MGM executives who decided McTiernans earlier more explicit version should be cut to ensure a PG-13 rating so the film could be marketed to young speed-obsessed boys. Yet its hard to imagine that a bloodier R-rated Rollerball could have elevated a farcical story line propelled by half-wits on wheels. The project stinks of stupidity from the woeful dialogue to the cardboard characters to the gaudy goofy sets and costumes which look like prop and design rejects from American Gladiator. The original Rollerball a cult favorite from 1975 starring James Caan was not an especially good movie either the idea behind it being cooler than the execution. But the original at least carried a broad notion of spectator violence as symptom of a sick society and it looks a bit prescient given the heightened intensity of competition today and the rise of reality television. The remake is a narrow miserly story about a handful of dupes who sign on to play an obvious bloodsport then whine when the game actually becomes bloody. While the first Rollerball was set in the future the remake is a contemporary story. McTiernan wanted to insinuate that greed could beget such savagery in our own corporate-branded world yet the message is undermined by geographical remoteness the story dumped off in the central Asian republic of Kazakhstan. Introducing the home team dupes Jonathan (Chris Klein) an NHL wannabe who winds up the pampered star of the rollerball league; his buddy Marcus (LL Cool J) who lures Jonathan into the game with promises of big bucks; and teammate Aurora (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) a motorcycle mama with a nasty facial scar and an indeterminate Eurasian accent. Team owner Petrovich (Jean Reno) makes sure his stars have the fastest coolest cars and live the highest of high lives. But come game time he keeps an eye on the instant TV ratings ordering strategic accidents to spice up the matches when the audience dwindles. It was only a matter of time before one of those creeps figured out their take would go up with a little blood on the tracks Marcus observes. Who says sports stars are dumb? Klein LL Cool J and Romijn-Stamos are bland and Klein dips to caricature near the end in a showdown so silly it resembles a Saturday Night Live spoof of action films. Reno a fine French actor who seems to be getting sucked dry by Hollywood films is so bad he becomes unintentionally hilarious. The rollerball outfits and arenas are too absurd to describe (OK just a couple skull masks and pointy-eared helmets). Ditto for the repetitive head-banging music the rollerball house bands play to enliven the crowds. The movie ultimately glorifies violence as the athletes viciously rebel against the owners and their henchmen. Adult audiences will find the rabid climax laughable but for teens toward whom the movies targeted the message is execrable Feeling oppressed? Pick up a stool and crack a few skulls. Its your right. Then again Rollerball is so dumb that speed-obsessed little boys may find it laughable too. Rollerball an MGM release is rated PG-13 for violence extreme sports action sensuality language and some drug references. Running time 98 minutes. One star (out of four).

The ugliness of the sports business provides the context for the wreckage that is ""Rollerball."" Although Norman Jewisons stolidly grim and ultimately ludicrous 1975 original was hardly a landmark of nightmarish sci-fi it towers over this the second Jewison picture that John McTiernan has remade after ""The Thomas Crown Affair."" New pic is sheer chaos on wheels a hysterically edited jumble that defies belief at nearly every juncture. MGMs latest plunge into its library which was postponed from its original August release date will lure in unsuspecting guys teased by its WWF and extreme sports allusions but word of mouth will shortly send this one to the showers. The opening minutes are just goofy enough to set up expectations for a fresh ""Rollerball"" that knows not to take itself seriously -- certainly not nearly as seriously as the original. Our hero Jonathan (Chris Klein) and his unidentified opponent compete in a death-defying luge race down the streets of San Francisco; then Jonathans buddy Marcus Ridley (LL Cool J) suddenly appears out of nowhere and snatches up Jonathan in his Porsche before the cops can get him. Marcus tells Jonathan he should drop his plans to try out for the NHL and try out for the Rollerball league instead. Four months later Jonathan has indeed opted for Rollerball which is centered -- of all places -- in the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan and operated by business mogul and ex-KGB agent Petrovich (Jean Reno). Jonathan appears ready to play any game for the paycheck and Kazakhstan can apparently outbid the NHL. Jonathan also seems to like knocking competing Rollerballers upside down and sideways and a little blood doesnt bother him either. But the game itself is explained (by Paul Heymans obnoxiously excessive play-by-play announcer) and edited so frantically that its indecipherable Gone is the originals long elegant roller derby-like rink in favor of a cheesy-looking welter of figure-eight loops ramps and platforms that appear designed to cause multi-skater pileups. The players all adopt various personae complete with silly costuming including full medieval armor. In the case of Rebecca Romijn-Stamos Aurora her helmet covers her eyes. Off-rink conflict has Petrovich secretly wanting to increase the sports violence (for the ratings which could lead to a U.S. cable deal) which Jonathan opposes. After a rapid sexual tryst in the team locker room between Jonathan and Aurora she shows Jonathan videotape revealing that a recent game accident was actually prearranged. By the time the team plays a second game in what appears to be Saudi Arabia and then a third in Mongolia even Marcus -- who after all is responsible for getting Jonathan into this mess -- senses something is rotten. Aurora helps the guys escape which is filmed for no good reason in night vision pea-soup green but leading to pics only exciting few moments as Jonathan is captured; his torture is listening to Renos peculiar brand of English (""I have geeeven you totahl freedom eeeven satellite tee-vee"") The final game as in the original is to the death but this time Klein is garishly turned into Charles Bronson on roller skates butchering the bad guys including Petrovichs calculating right-hand man Sanjay (Naveen Andrews mightily trying to camp it up). Much of this appears to have been frantically shortened for time but any violence -- as well as Romijn-Stamos carefully silhouetted breasts -- are kept just this side of an R rating. Although role provides Klein with his first starring turn it robs him completely of the charming fresh-scrubbed image he memorably first projected in Alexander Paynes ""Election."" Klein seems like an unhappy camper from start to finish. LL Cool J is his usual relaxed self while Romijn-Stamos is directed to lift weights topless and to look tough. The only impressive design or production feature in this ugly-looking affair is a lineup of ultra-sleek sports cars doled out as rewards to the speed-addicted Rollerball stars.

McTiernans remake dumps most of the would-be thoughtful stuff and concentrates on folks braining each other with large ball bearings. Disgruntled ice hockey player Klein proves ripe for plucking when old pal LL Cool J suggests he sign up for the hot new sports start-up in a distant central Asian republic. Rollerball is promoter Renos baby mixing bikers and rollerbladers mayhem and leather on a figure eight track but there are shady business interests in the background and players bristling against rising levels of carnage. The issue here though is less the individuals stand against corporate oppression but whether Reno can get a US cable TV deal. Rollerball looks like a checklist shaped by a 15-year-old mallrat thrashing metal track skateboards motorbikes cracked heads and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos with her top off.

Wilson; Release Date Wide 02/08/2002; Runtime (in minutes) 98; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor MGM Posted February 13 2002 -- 1200 AM EST Rollerball is a remake of the 1975 Norman Jewison thriller that no one I know was clamoring to see a remake of. The original is best remembered for its future-shock vision of extreme sports but its also one of the last of that godawful wave of 70s sci-fi movies (""Zardoz"" ""Soylent Green"") that got bogged down in a cautionary funk about the terrible fascist fate for which America was headed. I wish I could say that the action scenes in John McTiernans ""Rollerball"" are exciting but the decadent blood sport a rowdy smash-em-up cross between Roller Derby and ice hockey looks if anything far less brutal and nihilistic in the age of the WWF and the Vegas-gone-Madison Avenue Super Bowl than it did back in the 70s. Chris Klein as the rollerball champ who uncovers a secret plan to up the sports violence for ratings seems to be doing an impersonation of Keanu Reeves at his most out-of-it. For some reason the film is set in Central Asia where Jean Reno as the sleazy Russian inventor of rollerball broadcasts the contests on what looks like the local version of al Jazeera. ""Rollerball"" was trash even back in 1975 but in some small way it was ahead of its time. The new version just makes you feel like youve been watching a lame late-night rerun while stuck in a thunderdome. Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

Photo Credit Attila Dory. HANDOUT. Marcus Ridley (portrayed by LL COOL J) gets airborne in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures action thriller ROLLERBALL. Photo Credit Attila Dory. HANDOUT. Speed kills / Rollerball remake is a fast noisy empty dead end 1 / 1 Back to Gallery ROLLERBALL Action. Starring Chris Klein Jean Reno LL Cool J and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos. Directed by John McTiernan. (PG-13. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Rollerball"" is a remarkable film Remarkably empty remarkably noisy remarkably pleasureless. It presents every moment as though it were an action scene and presents every action scene with shaky jump cuts and heavy-metal music. Its unwatchable. John McTiernan directs it as though he were in the artistic equivalent of a rollerball game with every other director who has ever made an action movie. He takes the modern trend of loud camera-gyrating nonstop commotion to the ultimate extreme. Simon West who directed ""Tomb Raider"" was a wimp by comparison. ""Raider"" actually had moments when the audience couldnt hear a drum machine -- what was that guy thinking? McTiernan by contrast never lets up. He takes ""Rollerball"" down an artistic dead end and when he bangs into a brick wall -- an audiences capacity to sustain abuse -- he blasts through and keeps going. For ""Rollerball"" -- indeed for movies in general -- this is the road to nowhere. Its the reduction of the film-going experience to a series of sensations all of them unpleasant. Chris Klein with his clean-cut Tin-Man-in-""The Wizard of Oz"" good looks plays Cross a thrill seeker who in the movies first sequence -- the best in the picture -- lies down on a kind of skateboard and rolls downhill through downtown San Francisco. McTiernan at moments seems to have the camera on the skateboard creating a roller-coaster effect. After that stunt Cross has to leave town fast so he joins up with a friend (LL Cool J) and goes to Central Asia where he becomes a rollerball sensation (the game is something like Roller Derby). The rollerball scenes are long and punishing. The camera cuts from close- ups of the action to charts to TV screens to scoreboard advertisements to big shots sitting in an observation booth to musicians flailing on guitars. Just so we know whats going on (but we never do) an English-language announcer calls the game and tells us what we should be seeing but cant and should be feeling but arent. ""The audience can smell it"" the announcer raves. ""Cross is going over the top"" He is? Its bad when a movie is incomprehensible. Its bad and also peculiar when a movie is incomprehensible but leaves the viewer with a distinct sense that theres nothing to comprehend anyway. Thats where we stand with ""Rollerball."" Jean Reno plays a tough Russian entrepreneur who runs the rollerball league and dreams of one thing -- ""North American cable rights."" One night he notices that his ratings go up when someone is injured so he starts orchestrating little catastrophes in the rink where players get banged up and carried off bleeding. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos in a thankless role as the scarred rollerballer Aurora gets wind of this and suddenly everyones life is in danger. To the extent that ""Rollerball"" has a plot its pretty disingenuous. Cross is playing a violent contact sport in a harsh part of the world and yet hes shocked that the promoters are contriving to make it more violent. Did he think he was doing something wholesome? Off the rollerball rink McTiernan keeps the pace by cranking up the soundtrack and showing people driving fast. At one point he turns the camera sideways for no reason but that its the wrong thing to do. He even inserts a gratuitous riot scene. Clearly those rioters are upset about something whatever it is. In ""Rollerball"" we get information on a need-to-know basis. In truth we dont need to know -- or see -- any of it. Advisory This film contains brief nudity sensuality blood and violence.

Rollerball Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2002) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/rollerball-2002,200,rollerball12,rollerball,rogerebert
"USATODAY.com - Daredevilish derby really drops the ball Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 02/08/2002 - Updated 1208 AM ET Daredevilish derby really drops the ball By Mike Clark USA TODAY Rollerball (out of four) Stars Chris Klein Jean Reno LL Cool J Rebecca Romijn- Stamos Director John McTiernan Distributor MGM Rating R for violence extreme sports action sensuality and some drug references Related items Rollerball revisits debate Whether viewed as an alleged anti-violence diatribe silly sports extravaganza or needless movie remake the new and long-delayed Rollerball is missing a few key elements a script a reason for being and maybe a few Britney Spears ads strategically placed throughout to break up 98 minutes of solid tedium. Originally a futuristic indoor spectacle undermined by undynamic leads (James Caan Maud Adams) the original Rollerball opened in summer 1975 as a relative non-event in the immediate wake of Nashville and Jaws. The idea at the time -- and neither version ever rises above the level of an idea -- was that fan bloodlust and unscrupulous club owners were so on the rise in sports that someone might try to concoct a game in which all bets were off in terms of safety penalties and even rules. In this new literal go-round the story is set somewhere close to the present day following an opening that sinks the movie from the start. It involves a stupid San Francisco street stunt that in real life would land its participants on the network news and probably in prison. Cut instead to Central Asia where co-perpetrator Chris Klein (getting farther away from his terrific turn in Election) joins high school football buddy LL Cool J in a professional rollerball league. Unlike the original movie the game requires heavy player padding track-roving motorcycles and a unique method of scoring (the ball is metal for starters). But these are embellishments to what looks like a standard roller derby straight out of 1951 television. These days the teams are coed but this is a PG-13 movie which means the locker-room scenes lack the great-to-be-alive zest of their sexier army-barracks counterparts in Starship Troopers. Even so Klein is romancing a teammate (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) though like everything else here their union never goes anywhere dramatically. Team honcho Jean Reno his mustache befitting a Genghis Khan movie has both eyes on a computerized ""Global Instant Rating"" which instantly tells him how fervently international viewers are reacting to the games contusion quotient (say a 20.2 or a 9.1). Old Jean likes those 20s. The movies violence is all-pervasive but not particularly graphic crunching sound effects aside. Thats because the only conceivable audience for a movie without characters or concrete situations is young teen boys -- and not the boys about to be future captains of industry but the ones who make flatulence sounds with their armpits in the back of class. The word on Rollerball is ""troubled"" though troubled is what you call a high school junior with 50 snakes under his bed. Catastrophe is more like it. With no characters to play no one can really act and its depressing to see that when LL Cool J is faced with a life-threatening situation high-priced screenwriters have been paid high prices to have him say nothing more than ""Were outta here."" It cuts both ways so Im outta here too. Almost as fast as Rollerball is gonna be outta theaters.
