Comments LAttesa 100 minutes  2015 A woman whose brother has just died (Juliette Binoche) invites her sons girlfriend (Lou de Laage) to stay at her sprawling Sicilian villa and as mourners drift in and out they await the sons arrival on Easter Sunday. The religious symbolism is overbearing but first-time director Piero Messina keeps his simple story loosely based on two plays by Luigi Pirandello muted and equivocal. Messina has said he was inspired by the trauma of some friends who lost their son; for a day no one spoke of the death pretending instead that it never happened. The film captures the potency of such denial in long lush shots of the two women both French as they drift further into isolation and grow increasingly terrified of their need for each other. The two women repeat the line ""Im waiting"" so often that it seems like an incantation as if the power of their longing might hasten the sons return. In Italian and French with subtitles.

Magnolia Pictures Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint High-Rise [?][?]1/2 out of four stars Rated R for violence disturbing images strong sexual content/graphic nudity language and some drug use. Theater Lagoon. The late English novelist J.G. Ballard the George Orwell of postmodern science fiction was fascinated by the dystopian collision of modern technology and human vulnerability. His 1975 novel ""High-Rise"" explored a sky-high city undergoing social collapse. Each hulking concrete floor was the habitat for a distinct class rising from proletarian to elites up to the architect literally ruling the roost from the penthouse. On the premium levels balconies offer broad views to residents willing to lean forward out of balance. Ben Wheatleys adaptation of the fable casts Tom Hiddleston as a cranial physician newly moved onto the 25th floor where he is disdained from above resented below. He explores the buildings huge indoor swimming pool gym vast grocery and floor-wide weekend drug parties calmly at first. He arrives in the building with the cucumber-cool nonchalance of a first-class passenger on the Titanics maiden voyage but charming cultured disciplined skull-slicing doctors can have their barbaric sides too. Just ask Mr. Hyde. Jeremy Irons plays the godlike designer of the building hosting the upper crusts crowded costume parties as nasty Versailles nobility. There are plenty of sadistic boors in the working class as well and glitches that make the building a claustrophobic 24-hour migraine. After a couple of months this luxury laboratory for social progress descends into a decadent slow-mo adults gone wild rape-filled version of ""Lord of the Flies."" The film nails the mid-70s love/hate aesthetic of hip little cars bell-bottoms and Abba hits twisting each to sulfuric ugliness. Portisheads cover of ""SOS"" turns it from Swedish disco pop to a sonic nightmare. Still more unsettling are the halls strewn with garbage bags broken bottles graffiti excrement and the blood of the weak. Its an interesting experiment in bemused ironic entropy provided you can suspend disbelief start to finish and keep your last meal in your abdomen. LAttesa [?][?][?] out of four stars Unrated In subtitled Italian and French. Theater Edina. Stunning European locations where two women generations apart deal with their contentious relationship and themselves. Thats the art-cinema theme of the moment for French film icon Juliette Binoche. She and Kristin Stewart confronted that premise in the Swiss Alps during last years ambitious drama ""Clouds of Sils Maria"" playing a veteran actress and a young newcomer threatening her career. She faces a different moody midlife crisis Sicilian-style in ""LAttesa."" Binoche plays a single mother living with her sons naive young lover (Lou de Laage) at her Mediterranean villa spending time with her as they await his arrival. Its not happening soon. The films name is Italian for ""the wait"" and Binoches character is in no rush to tell the girl what is causing her boys absence. The opening shot suggesting the tragic image of the Virgin Mary holding her lifeless sons body in her arms explains her silence. A complicated drama with many unanswered mysteries director Piero Messinas film is visually breathtaking turning simple dinner scenes or stained glass windows into high art. The story is minimal but the imagery -- and the hypnotic Binoche -- are masterful.

(Alberto Novelli/Oscilloscope Laboratories) Mourning has never looked quite as exquisite as when Juliette Binoche does it in ""The Wait."" As Anna a woman whose son has just died she dazzles even when lying in bed still in her funeral clothes her expressive eyes fixed on the void. But ""The Wait"" is about more than sorrow -- even beautiful sorrow. Its about the strange sometimes inexplicable ways people cope with loss. Frenchwoman Anna lives alone on a sprawling Sicilian estate that once belonged to her ex-husbands parents. With only a taciturn caretaker (Giorgio Colangeli) for company Anna could go on lying in bed forever but a phone call brings her back to life. Its Jeanne (Lou de Laage) the girlfriend of Annas late son who clearly hasnt heard the bad news. Shes calling to confirm an upcoming visit. This is where things get weird. Rather than tell Jeanne the truth Anna replies that yes she and her son Giuseppe are expecting her. And when the lovely shy Jeanne arrives curious about Giuseppes absence Anna tells another lie explaining that he had to leave town due to a death in the family but that he will be back in time for the Easter holiday. Even though ""The Wait"" takes place in the early 2000s before the advent of Facebook and all the public mourning that came with it its still difficult to imagine that Jeanne would fall for Annas story especially after she calls Giuseppe multiple times on his cellphone to no response. But even with a plot that hinges on the implausible the movie somehow works. The narrative is less important than the complex emotional landscape that ""The Wait"" so artfully depicts. Making his feature debut director Piero Messina is already adept at calibrating the constantly shifting atmosphere whether panning across the barren charred-looking landscape of Sicily holding tight focus on Annas pained eyes or following Jeanne underwater where she glides serenely ignorant of the truth. As the two women begin to bond the camera focuses on their hands just a couple of inches apart as they sit together in a Turkish bath. Later the mood lightens when Anna hosts a lively dinner party with two men Jeanne has met at the beach. But the pain is never far away. In the corner the caretaker shoots Anna a judgemental look for not telling Jeanne the truth. Annas deception raises an intriguing question about her morality. Not only has she lied to Jeanne but shes been listening to the voice-mail messages that the girl leaves Giuseppe alternately pleading with him to call her back and flirtatiously suggesting what they should do when they reunite. Is Annas suffering enough to warrant these actions? Those that know the truth dont think so. ""Im waiting for the right time to tell her"" Anna promises her perplexed sister-in-law (Corinna Locastro) her lower lip quivering but barely. The lead actresses like the story work in subtle ways. Theres plenty of potency in small gestures anecdotes and shared glances. Methodically paced ""The Wait"" doesnt move quickly but it goes by fast. (Time flies it seems even when youre not having fun.) All it takes is the captivating presence of skilled professionals. Unrated. At Landmarks West End Cinema. Contains nudity.

EntertainmentMovies In heart-wrenching LAttesa the wait is the hardest part Originally published May 5 2016 at 610 am Updated May 5 2016 at 1215 pm Lou de Lage left and Juliette Binoche in ""LAttesa."" ""LAttesa"" Juliette Binoche stars as a mother with a terrible secret she cant bear to tell her sons visiting girlfriend. 3.5 out of 4 stars. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic ""Im waiting for the right time to tell her"" says Anna (Juliette Binoche) in a broken tiny whisper. The news that she cant tell is so terrible that you see Annas lips tremble when she later tries and fails to say it -- she just cant form the words. Her son Giuseppe is dead and his girlfriend Jeanne (Lou de Laage) who has come to visit for Easter does not know. ""LAttesa"" from Italian filmmaker Piero Messina (in his first feature) is a spare elegant tale of heartbreak -- of how a story untold lets a character clutch desperately to another story one that isnt true. Anna a Frenchwoman who lives in Sicily in the kind of ancient home where footsteps echo through quiet hallways is keeping her son alive by refusing to tell Jeanne of his death; she can pretend that she like Jeanne is just waiting for him to arrive. (The films title in English is ""The Wait."") Little happens during the film as we like Anna and Jeanne wait for someone who isnt coming Meals are cooked walks are taken voicemail messages to Giuseppe are left (by a puzzled increasingly worried Jeanne) and listened to (sadly by Anna who has his phone). We see beautiful shots of the Sicilian countryside -- a road edged in mist making it faint like memory -- and of the artfully captured light in Annas home. But mostly we watch Binoches face in eloquent mesmerizing close-up; pain and grief engulf her expression like water flooding into a still pool. She has few words. She doesnt need them.

Binoche gives a great performance in LAttesa 1 / 2 Back to Gallery ""LAttesa"" -- also known as ""The Wait"" -- is atmospheric and moody serious and full of portent and if it werent so good it would probably be unbearable. In his feature debut director Piero Messina understands that he is dealing with grand issues with time and life and death and he has the artistic confidence to present them without irony and without short cuts. He watches. He moves in close. He waits as much as his characters wait and he finds some great moments. If you want to see great acting -- or more to the point if you want to see an illustration of the human souls complexity -- watch Juliette Binoche in this film. Through her we see the possibility of feeling and thinking multiple thoughts and emotions at once as well as one actress ability to convey that complexity almost entirely through her eyes. What was acting before movies were invented? Such moments would be lost from a stage; they couldnt exist. And yet such acting is as exalted as anything in art. Based on a story by Pirandello the movie is set in Sicily and so its no surprise that it begins with a funeral. Binoche as Anna -- a French woman who moved to Sicily when she got married -- is burying her son in the days before Easter. Later that day or the next when the mourners are still gathered at the house a young woman shows up at her door. Shes Jeanne (Lou de Laage) the fiancee of the dead son there to spend the holiday. She has no idea that her fiance is dead. She expects that he has already arrived; and weirdly and spontaneously Anna doesnt tell her the truth. She says that the son will be arriving the next day. The rest of the film is all about waiting. Jeanne waits for a man who will never show up and we wait for Anna to break the bad news. As for Anna the films enigma what is she waiting for? The right moment? Or for her own pain to begin to lessen? Or does she just want to extend Jeannes visit so as not to be alone in a cavernous villa? Old buildings are romantic when contemplated from America where everything is new. Here we see old from the Italian point of view that old can be suffocating that ancient stone can dwarf the spirit. Though Binoche goes through ""LAttesa"" looking like an Italian matriarch grave and dressed in black she speaks French through most of the film. Jeanne is also French and its clear not only in the script but in the way Binoche looks at her that Anna completely understands this young woman that 25 or 30 years ago Anna was Jeanne. Its such a help to the film -- actually its essential -- that Messina was able to find an actress of quality to play the younger woman. Lou de Laage has the poise intelligence and precision to match Binoche. ""LAttesa"" takes place between Good Friday and Easter and tells the story of a mother and son and so it can be understood through the prism of Christian symbolism. Certainly that element is present and intentional but theres a right way and a wrong way to deal with symbols. The point is not that one thing is really something else. The point is rather something stronger and more simple -- that when a mother loses her grown son its the death of Christ. That is its a disaster on that scale.

"Moody and in mourning LAttesa (The Wait) explores depths of grief - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Moody and in mourning LAttesa (The Wait) explores depths of grief Mini Latesa Review Alberto Novelli / Indigo Film Juliette Binoche in ""The Wait."" Juliette Binoche in ""The Wait."" (Alberto Novelli / Indigo Film) Katie Walsh A psychological connection forms between two women around an unspoken secret in ""LAttesa (The Wait)"" the feature debut of director Piero Messina. Jeanne (Lou de Laage) on a trip to visit her estranged boyfriend Giuseppe at his home in Italy unknowingly wanders into an oppressively stifling atmosphere of grief though no one is being quite truthful with her.She waits for Giuseppe to arrive even as his mother Anna (Juliette Binoche) mourns someone -- her brother she claims. The untruths become a game of psychological cat and mouse between the women with Jeanne leaving Giuseppe voicemails wondering where he is and the women beginning to bond under the Sicilian sun. SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt;The film starts interminably heavy and slow beneath a somber dark cloak that begins to lift when Jeanne arrives with a sense of youthful energy and sensuality that brighten the dark and heavy rooms of the house. Her presence as a creature that needs tending brings an immediacy to the moment and Anna begins to indulge in corporeal pleasures like cooking to entertain her guest. The women offer each other a bit of a reprieve from a reality that is never entirely made clear and differs for each of them. Only the houseman Pietro (Giorgio Colangeli) stands for the truth. The film is a moody and lyrical contemplation of grief and the connections that can be found within the void of loss.-------------""LAttesa (The Wait)""In French and Italian with English subtitlesNot ratedRunning time 1 hour 40 minutesPlaying Laemmle Royal West Los Angeles Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times A version of this article appeared in print on April 29 2016 in the Entertainment section of the Los Angeles Times with the headline ""An exploration of the depths of grief - `LATTESA (THE WAIT)"" -- Todays paperTodays paper | Subscribe Reviews Movies Entertainment Juliette Binoche Indie stalwart James Schamus makes his directorial debut with Indignation Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-mini-lattesa-review-20160429-story.html,200,waiting...5,waiting...,latimes

Courtesy of Oscilloscope Films hide caption toggle caption Courtesy of Oscilloscope Films Lou de Laage and Juliette Binoche in LAttesa (The Wait). Courtesy of Oscilloscope Films Set amid Sicilys stark volcanic landscape LAttesa (The Wait) is a visually powerful impeccably acted mood piece. But the movie is not for the literal-minded -- a group that at times includes director and co-writer Piero Messina. The idea for the film came from Luigi Pirandellos play The Life I Gave You and its theatrical origins survive in the many scenes that feature just two actors Juliette Binoche and Lou de Laage. They play Anna a French-born widow who has long lived in a remote villa near Mt. Etna and Jeanne a younger Frenchwoman who has just arrived. Jeanne is there to visit Giuseppe her boyfriend and Annas son but finds herself in the hushed aftermath of a funeral. Mirrors are cloaked in black and tongues are tied. Anna cant bring herself to tell the newcomer whats happened and Jeanne doesnt figure it out for the longest time. Viewers will probably be quicker on the uptake. The latest in a string of grieving-survivor roles that began with Three Colors Blue Binoches Anna shows a fetishistic attachment to her sons things notably an air mattress filled with his breath. Jeanne whose relationship with Giuseppe was intermittent and apparently turbulent is better equipped to move on -- if only someone will tell her what happened. Like Faulkners The Sound and the Fury LAttesa transpires during Easter week. This timing and the opening funeral allows Messina to frame the story with images of death and resurrection. In the opening scene the camera almost caresses the crucifix that darkly presides over the local church. And the movies Fellini-like climax is staged during a solemn procession of hooded men where the director indulges a magical-realist flourish. In between LAttesa is more French. Anna and Jeanne get to know each other in the kitchen while swimming and on excursions to local tourist attractions. For Anna of course becoming acquainted with Jeanne is also learning about Giuseppe. At one point Jeanne meets two young men and invites them to Annas austere home for dinner. Everyone drinks eats and flirts showing that life goes on spontaneously -- even if Jeanne and a guy dance to Leonard Cohens ""Waiting for the Miracle"" not one of the all-time-great party tunes. (Other portentous musical choices include the XXs ""Missing"" and inevitably an Arvo Part lament.) Heard but unanswered cellphone messages advance -- while also stalling -- the story. They demonstrate that Anna and Jeanne do indeed live in the modern (if not precisely contemporary) world. Yet the overall impression is of someplace out of time. The director expertly uses weathered buildings and lifeless terrain as visual equivalents of Anna and Jeannes weekend in limbo. Messina served as assistant director on Paolo Sorrentinos The Great Beauty and he shares that filmmakers flair for balletic cinematography. The camera swoops and cranes and sometimes turns subjective as when conveying the birth-like experience of surfacing from the depths of a lake. Perhaps this is just because of the movies solemn theme but Messina does not share Sorrentinos interest in shifts of tone. The movie remains stubbornly minor-key enlivened only by Binoche and de Laages naturalistic performances. LAttesa offers striking images of grief and rebirth but its most persuasive when depicting everyday life.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The trailer for LAttesa an Italian drama starring Juliette Binoche constitutes a masterful exercise in obfuscation. Half the length of an average trailer (at just one minute and 15 seconds) it reveals almost nothing about the films narrative merely showcasing random images set to a Widowspeak tune. Brief subtitled dialogue reveals that a young woman (played by Breathes Lou De Laage) is waiting for her boyfriend (the films title translates as The Wait) that shes staying with her boyfriends mother (Binoche) while she waits and that Mom is apparently lying to her but thats all we get. Its a canny strategy--partly because most trailers give far too much away but mostly because LAttesas plot is too ridiculous to withstand even trailer-length scrutiny. The only way to enjoy this movie is to concentrate on its frequently stunning compositions and ignore the fact that none of it makes even a tiny lick of sense.Set in a particularly gorgeous part of Sicily LAttesa opens with Anna the divorced French expat played by Binoche mourning somebodys death. The deceaseds identity is never quite specified but all evidence points to it being her adult son Giuseppe. Certainly other mourners look startled and concerned when Giuseppes girlfriend Jeanne shows up and asks where he is. But Anna after ducking Jeanne for a while eventually tells her that its Giuseppes uncle whos died and that Giuseppe will arrive on Easter in a few days. So Jeanne sticks around killing time by swimming in the ocean and lightly flirting with one of the local boys. In between she leaves angry and/or pleading voicemail messages for Giuseppe... to which Anna listens as she has possession of Giuseppes cell phone. (Hmm...) Finally Anna sits Jeanne down and apologizes for having lied to her. Giuseppe isnt coming. Why not? Because hes dumped Jeanne. Sorry.By not expressly showing the viewer who died first-time director Piero Messina (who collaborated on the screenplay with three other writers) clearly intends to foster ambiguity. Everything has two plausible (though not equally plausible) interpretations. Its all cleverly done but there are just way too many blatantly nonsensical elements. Why does Jeanne accept Annas initial explanation of Giuseppes absence? Wouldnt he be more likely to be there not less if his uncle just died? If hes still alive and just avoiding Jeanne why does his mother have his phone? If hes dead and Anna wants Jeanne to let him go wouldnt telling Jeanne the truth serve that purpose much better than pretending that he no longer loves her? The one potentially compelling angle for this scenario would be if Anna were in such extreme denial about losing Giuseppe that shes choosing to keep him alive via Jeannes ignorance but Binoches performance never approaches that degree of sadistic pathology. Messina previously worked as an assistant director on Paolo Sorrentinos The Great Beauty and he shares Sorrentinos penchant for visual flamboyance though not his caffeinated editing rhythm. LAttesa frequently views its characters from a great distance at the center of neatly symmetrical architectural spaces or as tiny pools of light engulfed in a vast darkness. Like a lot of first films its often distractingly gorgeous--a boon in this case since distraction from various unanswered questions is precisely whats needed. (Theres no overlooking the blunt symbolism of Giuseppes ostensible return on Easter Sunday though.) Meanwhile what should be the movies emotional core gets frittered away in mind games. Even the final scene which pulls off a lovely moment of pure empathy falls prey to involuntary speculation about which version of events it seems to confirm. Best to view the whole thing as an abstract feature-length trailer. It plays better that way.

Playing a grieving mother named Anna in Piero Messinas Sicily-shot feature debut LAttesa (The Wait) the actress somehow makes even her long stretches of silence ring clamorously; her minimalist gestures are always maximized and engorged. Binoches hushed histrionics though are of a piece with the fruity portentousness of LAttesa which Messina wrote with three others freely adapting Luigi Pirandellos 1923 play The Life I Gave You. Film Details The Wait (Lattesa) RatingNR GenreDrama Running Time100 min. More Info The films premise strains credulity Anna first seen at her son Giuseppes funeral unexpectedly becomes a hostess when his girlfriend Jeanne (Lou de Laage) flies in from Paris to visit. The younger woman is unaware that Giuseppe is dead and Anna insists on concealing the truth telling her guest that hell be back for Easter dinner -- the resurrected-son theme just one of the movies many inane religious motifs. (There are more cowled figures skulking in slo-mo throughout this dream-pop-scored film than in all of Enigmas Nineties videos.) EXPAND Messina like Paolo Sorrentino for whom he worked as an assistant director on The Great Beauty (2013) is a hack voluptuary training the camera on a plastic cup as it rolls on a desk or on an inflatable pink pool mattress as it is carried by the wind in front of Annas villa. The latter item at least makes it off the ground; everything else in LAttesa sinks and buckles.

"The Wait Review A Bereaved Juliette Binoche Mourns Her Absent Son | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Venice Film Review The Wait Peter Debruge Chief Film Critic AskDebruge 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr Courtesy of Pathe September 5 2015 | 0140AM PT A mothers grief at the loss of her son underlies this cinematically dazzling debut though a surfeit of style and too many unanswered questions keep auds at arms length. Apart from the image of Jesus hanging from the cross -- which incidentally is the first thing we see in Italian director Piero Messinas ""The Wait"" -- perhaps the most instantly recognizable scene in all Christian art is the Pietae or the lamentation of Christ in which the Virgin Mary cradles her lifeless son in her arms. While not a religious film per se Messinas profoundly dolorous debut -- the sort that suits festivals just fine but makes for depressing arthouse fare -- could easily be seen as the visually gifted directors reinterpretation of this iconic moment casting Juliette Binoche (since ""Blue"" cinemas most gifted griever) as a mother awaiting the return (or resurrection?) of her absent son. A clear disciple of Italian master Paolo Sorrentino the film-school-trained Messina served as assistant director on ""The Great Beauty"" and he adopts many of his mentors stylistic predilections on his first feature. ""The Waits"" dramatic premise could hardly be simpler leaving considerable room to explore the projects emotional and atmospheric dimensions Binoches Anna a single mother living in a remote Sicilian villa mourns the death of her son Giuseppe when she is caught off-guard by the arrival of Jeanne (Lou de Laage) who claims to be his lover. Instead of admitting the truth Anna decides to hold off ""for the right time to tell her"" using Jeannes naivete to sustain the illusion that he is not really gone. And so they wait. Jeanne who has flown from Paris to Sicily because Giuseppe asked allows her guilt to get the better of her choosing to imagine that her lover is avoiding her which could have something to do with an unspecified disagreement the previous summer (likely infidelity). Anna plays along. Pretending as if shes in contact with Giuseppe she tells Jeanne that hes promised to return in time for Easter -- which supplies not only a vibrant Sicilian parade but also a significant Christian symbol being the day of the sons resurrection. In no small way ""The Wait"" serves as an exploration of faith. Deliberately ambiguous the film ends without ever having given a clear answer on what happened to Giuseppe. Messina even goes so far as to cast an actor Giovanni Anzaldo in the role for a few scenes that we can reasonably assume take place exclusively in Annas head. Though his mother spends the first act trying to accept his passing something changes with Jeannes arrival Giuseppe is still alive in the young womans mind and Anna chooses to believe this reality instead of her own. After all Giuseppe has symbolically ""died"" once before as all sons inevitably do when leaving home to start their own lives and Jeanne is proof of this -- a mystery to be figured out not at all the ""type"" Anna might have imagined for her son. But when even this fantasy starts to crumble Anna tries to transfer it forward ""Let him go"" she tells Jeanne while holding on herself. ""Hell live a life ... fall in love ... maybe with another woman."" Though ""The Wait"" is essentially a two-hander other minor characters appear most notably a longtime family servant (Giorgio Colangeli) who dutifully keeps his mouth shut but can hardly bear to see Jeanne suffer. Though he never explains the situation outright his facial expressions give audiences all the indication they need to interpret whats really going on -- though Messina is almost maddeningly vague at times. Just how dense is Jeanne after all that she doesnt pick up on the clues? Or might she be ignoring them on purpose? One of the breakout stars of Melanie Laurents ""Breathe"" de Laage hasnt mastered Binoches incredible gift for minimalism -- that unique ability to convey virtually any emotion (in this case profound suffering) through something so simple as a far-off stare or subtle twitch of the cheek. Still de Laages more outwardly physical acting technique is hardly a liability as the enigmatic-looking young thesp (who belongs more to the Lea Seydoux school of naturally pouty beauties) brings something different to the dynamic which after all hinges on how these two very different women react to Giuseppes absence. Projects like this which take place almost entirely in one location (Annas villa) are often criticized for being overly theatrical and coincidentally enough Messina was partly inspired by the play ""The Life I Gave You"" by Luigi Pirandello (the Nobel winner who wrote ""Six Characters in Search of an Author"") in which a mother refuses to accept her sons death. Still although ""The Wait"" focuses on the psychological dance between Giuseppes mother and lover the director has approached the potentially stagy material in almost strictly cinematic terms. Benefiting enormously from its evocative Sicilian setting this widescreen experience makes bewitching use of space time and sound creating an almost meditative atmosphere in which patient-minded auds might respond to its themes. Some scenes feel somewhat disembodied such as Jeannes arrival via a winding volcanic road set either to the XXs ""Missing"" (a recurring theme song) or equivalently melancholy electronic tracks. Others such as the one in which Anna first re-enters her sons room or Jeanne sits before an enormous stained-glass window privilege the actors mental state taking place in haunting near-silence like something out of an eerie ghost story -- which the film also happens to be. Watching ""The Wait"" there can be little doubt that this first-time helmer has the potential to become one of Italys most prominent new voices (the signs were there as early as his Cannes-selected 2011 student film ""Terra"" another abstractly stylized exercise in psychological identification featuring Colangeli). From Sorrentino Messina has further developed his ability to deliver a stunning sensory experience though the treatment feels inadequate for such lean material. If anything his aesthetic choices are too impressive calling attention to themselves rather than discreetly enabling the appropriate emotional reaction. He wants to invite us into the characters subconscious but leaves us admiring the surface. Like his characters were kept waiting for revelations that will never come.

TWITTER Juliette Binoche and Lou de Laage play women holed up in a Sicilian villa as they wait for respectively their son and boyfriend to return in Piero Messinas directorial debut. In Sicilian director Piero Messinas The Wait (LAttesa) French actress Juliette Binoche looks more like a matronly Mediterranean mother than ever somewhere between Mamma Romas Anna Magnani and Greek icon Katina Paxinou the matriarch in Viscontis Rocco and His Brothers. Shes the main attraction in this very loose Pirandello adaptation about a grieving mother holed up in a cavernous Sicilian villa who cant bring herself to tell her sons French girlfriend that hes died. Messina Paolo Sorrentinos assistant director on Oscar winner The Great Beauty occasionally indulges too much in stylistic superfluities and isnt the subtlest of directors something immediately clear when considering that hes telling a story about a death and the titular wait for a return (or resurrection) thats roughly set over the period between Good Friday and Easter Monday. But especially in Catholic countries this modern-day melodrama a Venice competition premiere should find pockets of believers. In the films impressive opening shot the camera spirals around a wooden statue of a crucified Christ apparently floating against a black backdrop before arriving at the bottom where suddenly the head of a nun comes into view. A cut then reveals that were actually inside a dark church where a funerals being held. The complex camera choreography is clearly a Sorrentinian influence but the cut feels like something of a ""gotcha"" moment; whats missing here is what makes these moments work for Sorrentino namely the fact that his stylistic flourishes always help advance the story or deepen the characters and their plights. This early into Messinas film with no sense of either the characters or the story a shot like this is simultaneously meaningless and borderline pretentious. The still raven-haired and alabaster-skinned Binoche plays the ominously named Anna (as in the grandmother of Jesus) a Frenchwoman whose Italian husband left her an enormous villa in the shadow of the Etna volcano in eastern Sicily where she still lives. Her twentyish son Giuseppe (Italian for Joseph) is presumably the one being buried during the films opening scene after which Anna retires clad in black to her hollow and empty-feeling home with all mirrors covered in black crepe. A landline call announces the arrival of someone Anna doesnt know Jeanne (Lou de Laage). The vivacious young woman turns out to be Giuseppes French girlfriend and shes packed her bags to come and spend Easter at the family home though now hes not answering his cell phone anymore. Anna lets her come over though she cant bring herself to tell this young woman -- named one assumes after Joan of Arc -- that Giuseppe has died. Initially though somewhat unusual the sentiment feels understandable because if Anna can keep Giuseppe alive for just one person then hes not completely gone yet and she doesnt have to deal with her grief. The screenplay written by a staggering four screenwriters including the director deviates significantly from Pirandellos play which focused on a how a mothers memories of her absent son were much better than the real thing. Amongst the major changes are not only Jeannes character but also the role of modern technology. Giuseppes cell phone which hes left in his room almost becomes a third character serving not only as confessional for Jeanne who keeps calling him and wondering when hell finally return home but also providing Anna with a way to get to know more about the young lovers by listening to Jeannes voicemail messages (many of them heard in voice-over). Annas unwholesome decision to keep mum becomes more objectionable with each moment that Jeanne passes in her home as they ""wait"" for his return ""in time for Easter"" and is also questioned by Pietro (Giorgio Colangeli) the homes lonely servant who acts as Annas conscience. But clearly this is the kind of Catholic melodrama in which the conceit of having a mother mourn her son alone and Jeanne standing in for the faithful eagerly awaits her beloveds return on Easter Sunday is too beautiful to resist. There are also subtler religious parallels woven in throughout including the suggestion that the films actually set in 2004 which makes more sense if one realizes that in that year on Good Friday the clearly ailing Pope Jean-Paul II briefly glanced on TV celebrated his last and very painful Via Crucis (he who would die almost exactly a year later). Audiences tolerance for this kind of heavy-handed occasionally very mannerist symbolism may vary though Messina does ensure that the religious parallels never completely eclipse the contemporary characters. They are given some space to be themselves notably in a jocular interlude involving two strapping young men (Antonio Folletto and Domenico Diele) that Jeanne befriends and whom she takes home for a dinner that Anna has prepared. The entire sequence beautifully suggests how in times of uncertainty or pain there are established rituals people fall back on that are comforting because each person knows which role to play (a kiss at the door is especially telling in this regard). Binoche has rarely looked more Italian than here and her command of the language has also audibly improved when compared to her awkwardly syncopated Italian in Kiarostamis Certified Copy. She has such quiet grace that even somewhat awkwardly metaphorical sequences -- like when Annas drinking days-old coffee from a stray cup in Giuseppes room or when she realizes that the air escaping from a pink inflatable mattress is actually her sons breath -- are transfigured into quietly wordless moments of considerable power. De Laage so good in Breathe also impresses here which is no small feat since her character is an odd mix of contrasting desires clearly wanting to reunite with her boyfriend enough to make it to Italy but also insouciant enough about his absence to never ask too many questions. Marco Bellocchios ace regular production designer Marco Dentici was responsible for the sets and locations and they play an important role. The austerely decorated mansion amplifies Annas sense of inner emptiness while making Jeanne feel somewhat lost while the surrounding volcanic landscapes consisting of black rocks and smoking crevices suggest nothing less than the gates of hell. Despite the opening and some other look-at-me shots -- someone swimming up for air as seen from the bottom of a lake; the sight of a pink inflatable mattress that the wind moves across a deserted inner courtyard -- which will have to be ascribed to the director and cinematographer Francesco Di Giacomos inexperience the films generally gorgeously shot with Di Giacomo frequently capturing the small cast in their surroundings in ways that help suggest their psychology. Indeed if Messina can find the right balance between his ambitions and his still-growing abilities as a filmmaker hell have a promising career ahead of him.
