Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""A Good Year"" with Russell Crowe Albert Finney Marion Cotillard Abbie Cornish Tom Hollander Freddie Highmore. Directed by Ridley Scott from a screenplay by Marc Klein based on the novel by Peter Mayle. 117 minutes. Rated PG-13 for language and some sexual content. Several theaters. The light in Ridley Scotts ""A Good Year"" looks so delicious it should be bottled. The tale of an overworked London businessman (Russell Crowe) who inherits a Provence vineyard (based on Peter Mayles popular 2004 novel) its twinkly fantasy for grown-ups All the characters are great-looking all the interiors are lavishly designed the mountains of food appear to have come from some culinary heaven and everyone talks whimsically to themselves the way people only do in movies. How you react to this movie will depend on your tolerance for this sort of thing; some will find it charming others will have forgotten it on the way back to the parking lot. Me? Well I took notes. Whichever side you fall on theres no denying that this movie pretty as it is is a waste of Crowes talents. As Max Skinner a financier who barks orders to an army of minions in a shades-of-gray London office hes required to do little but smirk ogle nearby women and smile puckishly from below a pair of oddly curly bangs that punctuate his forehead like quotation marks. Wealthy beyond words hes one of lifes winners (a change from the book which began with his firing) Inheriting the vineyard it turns out is something of a pleasant hassle; the fact that it comes complete with a charmingly eccentric staff and various gorgeous women dropping by is just a bonus The movies dramatic arc is the stuff of fantasy Should Max stay in his scary dark modernist apartment in rainy London and wallow miserably in his fortune? Or should he take a chunk of that fortune and escape to the good life in Provence where he can drink wine and wear striped blazers and murmur things in French throatily and unshavenly to the beautiful Fanny Chanel (Marion Cotillard)? Yes romantic comedies are known for stacking the deck but this one goes rather far in presenting Provence as a sort of wine-drenched utopia even to the point of an ugly and entirely unnecessary scene involving a pair of boorish unattractive Americans in a cafe seemingly present to smugly illustrate the difference between Us and Them. Scott and Crowe separately and together have made some splendid films. This one seemingly made on a lark is dessert and surely theyre entitled to it after the meat of ""Gladiator"" ""Master and Commander"" ""The Insider"" and the like. On a rainy day ""A Good Year"" may be welcome fantasy; the question is whether anyone will remember it after the clouds have parted.

G-205 Max (Russell Crowe) and Fanny (Marion Cotillard) get to know one another on their first date in A GOOD YEAR. Photo Unknown Crowe tries a romantic comedy manages neither 1 / 2 Back to Gallery A Good Year Romantic comedy. Starring Russell Crowe Albert Finney Marion Cotillard and Didier Bourdon. Directed by Ridley Scott. (PG-13. 118 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. To see complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) The last time Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott got together the resulting movie included dudes getting impaled by tridents barbarians being killed by the hundreds and Joaquin Phoenix throttling Richard Harris to death with his bare hands. After all the carnage in ""Gladiator"" perhaps the actor and director felt they owed the world a chick flick -- and it arrives this week with ""A Good Year"" a decapitation-free piece of cinema about wine and love and the things that money cant buy. Crowe and Scott bring a lot of effort to a project that probably meant a lot to both of them for entirely different reasons. But despite some stunning visuals and a lot of nice moments the finished product feels like the work of an actor and director who are out of their element. Its difficult to ignore the fact that theyve created a romantic comedy that has almost no romance and even less comedy. The first shot of ""A Good Year"" looks like a Monet painting -- all lily pads aging architecture and magic-hour lighting -- and the sights only get better from there. Setting the movie mostly in the Provence region of France Scott gives filmgoers the impression that theyre on holiday. Crowe plays Max a London banking titan who calls his underlings ""lab rats"" -- and they gladly take it because he makes them so much money. After learning about the death of his Uncle Henry (Albert Finney extremely entertaining in a series of flashbacks) Max heads to the French countryside where he considers selling the estate and runs into a couple of beautiful women who challenge his selfish power-hungry personality. The ""Blade Runner"" director takes an area filled with natural beauty and artfully chooses voyeuristic camera angles letting many of his shots linger on people and places for a few extra beats. Whether Scott is using his skills to create a sense of dread on a space station (""Alien"") or the confusion and chaos of battle (""Black Hawk Down"") he has a unique talent for making members of an audience forget that theyre in a theater. Unfortunately his romantic lead is an actor whose volatile personal life has been so well documented that its impossible to forget hes Russell Crowe. This role would seem like a good opportunity to soften the actors image but Crowes offscreen antics have made it nearly impossible to pull off the Hugh Grant/Bill Murray lovable workaholic. No matter how hard he tries to change his ways you still expect Max to chuck a telephone at the hired help. ""A Good Year"" is based on a novel by Scotts friend Peter Mayle -- they came up with the idea together -- and both clearly have a passion for vineyard life. The most enjoyable parts of the movie are the scenes that feature the films biggest wine lovers played by Finney and Didier Bourdon as the resident winemaker and Maxs nemesis. But Scott struggles mightily with the finer points of the genre. The comedy is mostly slapstick and the forced attempts at hilarity sometimes decline to Benny Hill depths (in one scene a car is sped up for comic effect) which dont fit well with the rest of the visual tone. And the romance is almost nonexistent until the final third of the film when Maxs courtship becomes so rushed that it seems foolish even by cinematic standards. It doesnt help that most of the female leads are uninspiring in their roles. Connie Nielsen from ""Gladiator"" is more fetching than all the women in ""A Good Year"" combined and she had to compete for time with a bunch of guys with swords getting mauled by tigers. -- Advisory This movie contains profanity sexual situations and language that may be offensive to Bay Area winemakers.

Max Skinner (Russell Crowe) settles into an intoxicating new chapter in his life in A Good Year. Photo 20th Century Fox A Good Year 1 / 1 Back to Gallery A Good Year builds so much fairy-tale contrivance with such boisterous high spirits that its exhausting to keep feeling good about feeling good. Its the male version of Underthe Tuscan Sun -- cut the weepy divorcee stuff and get on with wine-country womanizing. The country is France where the late uncle (Albert Finney) of top London bonds trader Max (Russell Crowe) leaves his nephew a fading chateau and vineyards. Dont worry -- theres not much sniffing slurping and raving about ""body"" and ""texture."" A Good Year isnt Sideways so much as straightforward as Max quickly shifts from being a greedy businessman bent on selling the place to a sentimental guy who has flashbacks to childhood visits and who abruptly falls for a local waitress (Marion Cotillard). Max admits he has a short attention span and so does the film. It breezes along as light and lively entertainment even as it neglects meaningful plot or character development. Crowe radiates star power as a lovable rogue whod sell his own uncle -- or at least his chateau -- to pad his fortune and his wheeler-dealer resume. Yet somehow he also shows compassion flexibility and sunny self-effacing charm. The real surprise is director Ridley Scott. Hes heaped hairy-chested tales of woe and war on us from Alien to Crowes own Gladiator.A Good Year looks odd on that list. But who would have snubbed a chance to spend months in Provence while getting paid for it? Perhaps thats why A Good Year is so agreeable The shoots vibe must have infused the film which may not mean much but is tres fun. This fun often erupts as boys-will-be-boys excess from an exhausting tennis match to reckless driving. But forget wine and song. This film fixates on women with a sexism as dusty as a 70s issue of Playboy. Regardless of age or occupation all females in A Good Year are desirable and accessible. One even asks a man shes just met to rub ice cubes on her naked back. Hey she has a sunburn and a guys got to do what a guys got to do. Yes its a mans world -- at least it is at Maxs chateau a fixer-upper that fixes him up with a truly good life.

The rhythm of the genre requires the main characters to descend so deeply into the pathetic to become a quivering mass of wet Kleenex so large that we demand amorous salvation just to stop all that puling. So what to do if all the people in a romantic comedy are not steeped in sympathy but instead wallowing in a very ripe barrel of smugness? ""A Good Year"" asks us to weep chardonnay tears for Max Skinner (Russell Crowe) for any of the following reasons 1. His 10 million bonus checks from his London hedge fund are handed to him by a grumpy boss. 2. The French vineyard left him by his deceased uncle has a mansion that needs a paint job. 3. The fact he neglected to call this kindly uncle for the last 20 years of his life now disturbs him - occasionally. 4. The vintner who toiled loyally for his uncle for decades now resents the sale of the estate and the vintners wife who nevertheless cooks and cleans for Max is slightly less servile than a London man of business has grown accustomed to. 5. The really hot French lawyer handling the estate might not date him. 6. The really really hot French restaurateur in the local village might make him wait a day or two before she dates him. Choked up yet or just choking? Max deserves about as much sympathy as Donald Trump with a paper cut. Full of pretentious grape-droppings on how wine is like life only tastier and with a bolder finish ""A Good Year"" is at best elusive to the palate. At worst its a bad pressing of a vintage that has no reisling to exist. Its not that Russell Crowe isnt trying. Rarely do natural tough guys work so hard to look so laid- back. The problem is Crowe is so much more believable chopping off human limbs at the hedge fund than he is trimming grapevines in the Bordeaux gloaming. With apologies to the hotel clerk who took a handset to the head I like Crowe better when hes throwing telephones. The grapes are all that more mushy because director Ridley Scott seems to stomp in random circles. The plot is simple Brash rich Londoner inherits Provence vineyard learns to love the countryside and lives happily ever after pretending to be a peasant. But ""A Good Year"" decants various subplots and then pours them onto the ground Is the beautiful young backpacker impersonating a family member to make a false claim on the estate? Was the chateau secretly (perhaps illegally) creating an off-label wine to fool buyers? Did mon uncle sleep with everything not nailed to an arbor? Meanwhile touches of the desperate screenwriter abound. A yipping dog pees on Maxs best suitpants. Unable to supply Max with a whimsical personality the script supplies him with a silly car instead. The women are given cleavage that only grapefruit farmers could dream up. Though the sun sets in the west in France as it does in most countries every character on the chateau is always backlit. Surprisingly Crowe almost pulls it off in the end thanks in part to a particularly luminous co-star in Marion Cotillard. Though they meet and date sweet enough to make even a fortified wine blush Crowe exudes the kind of man- scent where you cant doubt any woman falling for him. Its not nearly enough though. A good label cant save a sour wine. Franco-Brit raconteur Peter Mayle seems to bottle a new Provence novel every 12 months but not every batch is worth selling.

"Packing light - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Packing light Good Year revels in wine women and Provence By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  November 10 2006 ""A Good Year"" is a sun-drenched fantasy about the power of wine women and Provence to cure whatever ails us and it is no deeper than a bowl of consomme. And what of it? Movies are fantasy too and when a craftsman like director Ridley Scott and a gloomy Oscar-winning gus like Russell Crowe decide to take a vacation it can be time off for us all.Based on a novel by Peter Mayle -- who for 15 years now has been selling Provence to the masses like shrink-wrapped ham -- the new movie is a shamelessly enjoyable retread an ode to la belle vie that has been well turned on a factory spindle.Plus theres the pleasure of seeing Crowe lighten his load for once and not carry the weight of Marlon Brando on his shoulders. The actor even goes in for a little slapstick here and while its hardly convincing -- its like watching a Brahma bull trying to tap dance -- you appreciate the effort.When we first meet Max Skinner (Crowe) hes a British master of the universe a currency trader whos happy to break a gentlemans agreement if theres profit to be had. (Actually he does it for the sheer joy of being mean.) Max has it all -- a fast-track career a devoted assistant (Archie Punjabi) willowy women by the boxcar -- but is he really happy? If you answer yes you dont get out of the house enough.In flashback weve seen young Max at play in the French vineyards of his Uncle Henry (Albert Finney) an aging rapscallion who pegs the kid as his proper heir in knavery. Freddie Highmore the heart-wrencher of ""Finding Neverland"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" plays Crowe as a boy and he instinctively gets the ego and the quickness of the future man -- the love of getting one over on another person. Lord is this kid good.Back in modern-day England Max gets word that Henry has died and left the Provence estate to him; he reluctantly leaves his London kingdom and crosses the Channel to sell the place. Cue the birdsong the swoony Franche music and a lighting change from cold blues to deep honeyed ambers. Seriously the yellow-filter budget for ""A Good Year"" probably cost more than all of ""Little Miss Sunshine.""At this point Scott and company just stop and smell the lavender. ""Year"" crawls to a halt while Max investigates the fruits of his vineyard -- it tastes like battery acid unfortunately -- jousts with the slovenly estate caretaker (Didier Bourdon) and drinks in the sight of the local femmes. The films big joke is that there isnt a shabby-looking woman in the entire province and that beauty is encoded among them at the genetic level. The men of course are free to look like swine.Indeed this veers close to piggery -- or at the very least to a talented British director going heavy on the ooh-la-la -- but the sight of actress Marion Cotillard as a local restaurateur puts a stop to all complaints. She is simply elegantly meltingly lovely and theres not a thing you can do about it.""A Good Year"" piles on the complications without reaching the dizzying RPM necessary for farce; that would be too much work. A young American woman named Christie (Australian actress Abbie Cornish from ""Somersault"") turns up claiming to be Henrys illegitimate daughter and Max has to decide whether to welcome this potential cousin scare her off or seduce her. Yes thats a little creepy but Scott doesnt seem to notice and anyway were quickly off to the next meal the next bottle the next sunset.The film is about the magic of letting a place get to you -- changing your rhythms and thought patterns -- and it has the glow of a second week at the beach when you finally shake off your old life. The story line is utterly predictable and utterly beside the point; Scott and Crowe are after the ripeness of atmosphere.So the stars performance hangs on the film like grapes on the vine; the way Crowe plays it Maxs delight in financial piracy has merely been diverted toward the things one can touch soil the curve of a bottle or of a womans shoulder. If ""Sideways"" was about lifes bitter aftertaste ""A Good Year"" is about savoring the first swallow. Both movies are comedies; this ones just cheaper and easier to drink. Maybe it is travel-poster porn but its November now and the afternoons are dark. There are worse things to sell than hedonism.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor November 10 2006 Save for later Saved The best thing about ""A Good Year"" is the Provencal scenery. This is a bit like saying that the best thing about a restaurant is its decor. Ridley Scotts movie based on the Peter Mayle novel is a feast for the eyes but not much else.Russell Crowe plays Max Skinner a sharky London investment banker who inherits from his uncle Henry (Albert Finney seen in flashbacks) a chateau and vineyard in the south of France. Fresh from a killing in the market he flies to the estate intending to make another killing on the sale but instead falls in love with the slowed-down sensuousness of the lifestyle there.He also falls for the high-strung sensuosness of Fanny (Marion Cotillard) a local restaurant owner who has been burned too many times by men. He plays hard but shes hard to get. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? If ""A Good Year"" had settled for being a simple fable it might have cast the desired spell. Scott clearly reveres the great French comedy director Jacques Tati - clips of his films are shown and the estates dog is named Tati - but Scotts muscular temperament is about as far from the light-fingered Tatis as possible. The slapstick pratfalls and farcical escapades are clunkily staged. One in particular where Max tries to climb out of the muddy bottom of an abandoned swimming pool is almost a model of how not to construct a comic sequence. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Crowe is miscast. As if to advertise the fact that he is not the surly romantic icon of films past (including Scotts ""Gladiator"") he struts around Provence wearing dweeby glasses and with his straightened hair parted in the middle. This ploy is the masculine equivalent of all those movies where attractive women wear specs and dress like a spinsters in order to show us how wholesome they truly are.Because Crowe is hamstrung by his role he never strikes the requisite sparks with Cotillard. This is quite an achievement since her beauty is on par with Provences.Still the lush glimmer of the scenery is so eye-catching that its easy to sit back and experience ""A Good Year"" as a kind of tony travelogue. I suspect one reason the film was made in the first place was to offer the cast and Scott who has an estate and vineyard in the south of France the luxury of making a movie in Provence. Scott and Mayle toiled together in the vineyards of the English advertising world before becoming famous in their respective careers. ""A Good Year"" is their class reunion. Grade B- ""A Good Year"" is rated PG-13 for language and some sexual content.Sex/Nudity 7 scenes including implied sex. Violence 2 mild scenes. Profanity 40 instances including a few harsh expressions. Drugs/Alcohol/Tobacco 14 scenes with drinking 5 with smoking.

"A Good Year Equals a Bad 118 Minutes For Crowe washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies A Good Year Equals a Bad 118 Minutes For Crowe Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday November 10 2006 ""Under the Tuscan Son of Sideways"" is one way to sum up ""A Good Year"" which is not a very good movie. Ridley Scotts lackluster adaptation of the Peter Mayle novel stars a decidedly pinched-looking Russell Crowe as Max Skinner a London broker who inherits a gorgeous house in the south of France. Its a measure of Maxs impoverished spirit that he greets this as bad news. When hes forced to stay at the house -- which includes a vineyard -- Max meets the usual bevy of eccentric locals a lissome waitress and a beautiful American girl who may or may not be his cousin. Would it shock anyone to learn that after immersing himself in wine women and the modest but authentic pleasures of country life Max sees the error of his yuppie ways? Scott and Crowe who last worked together on the 2000 film ""Gladiator"" (which won Oscars for Best Picture and Crowe as Best Actor) should probably stick to togas. Pinstripes and Scotch -- and their counter-symbols tennis sweaters and vin ordinaire -- clearly arent their thing. Crowe whose fame as a heartthrob is nearly as great as his fame as a pugilist looks alternately bored perplexed and just plain miserable as a man whos nearly impossible to care about. Hes Gordon Gekko with a better accent but without the fun or sartorial flair. But care about him everyone does from his fast-talking female assistant back in London (played with peppery brio by Archie Panjabi) to the vineyards caretaker Duflot (Didier Bourdon) and his voluptuous wife played by Isabelle Candelier. (One day someone will explain whats going on with Crowes hair in this movie -- its either flopping hither and thither or parted straight down the middle in the kind of lacquered helmet that went out of style in 1922.) ""A Good Year"" is such a pastiche of similarly themed movies that when Maxs comically compact SmartCar sideswipes a bicycle being pedaled by a shapely pair of legs you half expect to see Diane Lane riding it in the Big Reveal. But its the French actress Marion Cotillard who while undeniably lovely to look at is instantly forgettable in the hackneyed role of the unapproachable local girl who cant stand the handsome newcomers pushy ways -- but falls into his bed anyway. As a prepackaged entertainment that never goes deeper than a travelogue or highbrow Harlequin romance ""A Good Year"" delivers the requisite goods nice scenery blunted humor a happy ending. But it does so with no zest or originality and even comes across as unforgivably lugubrious at times. (Abbie Cornish delivers a particularly surly performance as Maxs American relative-or-not.) Indeed the only time ""A Good Year"" comes to life is during the scenes when young Max played by ""Finding Neverlands"" Freddie Highmore is being tutored in the rules of being a gentleman by his beloved Uncle Henry played with avuncular high spirits by Albert Finney. You know a movie isnt working when youd rather just watch the flashbacks. A Good Year (118 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for profanity and some sexual content.

By John Hartl Film critic msnbc.com updated 11/9/2006 25541 PM ET 2006-11-09T195541 Print Font + - REVIEW Max Skinner is the sort of workaholic London investment banker who is so attached to his cellphone that the idea of taking a holiday seems worse than death. In ""A Good Year"" Ridley Scotts deeply artificial adaptation of Peter Mayles 2004 best-seller Russell Crowe plays the adult Max as a gleefully selfish manipulator with Enron ethics. He calls his co-workers ""lab rats"" he treats women as accessories and hes happiest when hes pulling off an investment scam that just might land him in legal trouble. But it wasnt always that way. As a childhood prologue suggests the young Max (played by the high-spirited Freddie Highmore) must have been the worlds happiest orphan. Spoiled by his extraordinarily indulgent uncle Henry (the shamelessly slumming Albert Finney) who raised him at his Provence chateau Max spent his summers swimming cheating at chess and becoming intimate with a cellar stocked with the finest wines. Like all the scenes set in Provence these episodes are shot with an intoxicating wide-screen splendor by cinematographer Philippe Le Sourd who makes Henrys estate (including a gorgeous vineyard) look so Eden-like that you cant imagine how Max could have brought himself to leave the place.

Every on-screen drink in Mad Men in 5 minutes See the Dancing stars most memorable moves Emmys biggest snubs? Cranston Hamm more Toy Story toys burn up in prank on mom However Max hasnt been in contact for years with his uncle who never created a will after they had a falling-out. When Henry dies the estate goes to his nearest relative. This means Max who decides to make a brief visit before selling it. Of course its not that easy. Overcome by nostalgia he cant move anywhere on the estate without thinking of his uncle and the good times they had together. Also prolonging his stay are a couple of headstrong women including a cousin (apparently Henrys daughter) played by Abbie Cornish who may have her own claim on the place. She also fascinates Maxs best friend Charlie (Tom Hollander) who succumbs to Provence almost as completely as Max does. Plot twists like these were probably designed to keep the familiar storyline from becoming predictable -- and to stretch ""A Good Year"" to two hours. But neither Mayle nor his co-writer Marc Klein (""Serendipity"") manage to make the complications compelling. Theres a lazy quality to the movie. Its as if the filmmakers imagined themselves as taking a vacation while they were shooting it. Scott once guided Crowe to a best-actor Oscar for ""Gladiator"" but wheres the magic not to mention the discipline this time? Max is supposed to go through a massive internal change from monster to mensch yet the transition is invisible. The attempts at comic relief including tired potshots at boorish American tourists and rude French waiters dont help. Equally disappointing are the supporting performances (the women are mysteriously bland) though Hollander salvages enough of his scenes to make you wish hed take over the job of playing Max and leave Crowe and Scott to party on. If youre looking for an undemanding date movie ""A Good Year"" may fill the bill. Its romantic and pretty and it works on some level as pure fantasy. Who wouldnt want to move to Provence under these conditions?

"Good Year A | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; good-year-a ) Good Year A (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli The desire for familiarity in movies can lead to sequels and re-makes but that doesnt always have to be the case. It can also mean the use of storyline everyone sitting in the theater knows. A Good Year is a respectable retelling of the ""back to nature"" narrative in which a selfish individual becomes seduced and saved by a pastoral setting and a pretty woman who lives there. Sound familiar? Although theres nothing surprising in Ridley Scotts version gorgeous photography and strong acting keep the formula from becoming stale. For those who dont mind pictures that fall into predictable rhythms A Good Year represents a pleasant diversion. Scott is a director who feels equally at home filming epics and smaller character-based dramas. A Good Year is an example of the latter. After the disappointment of Kingdom of Heaven (which was re-edited into something far more powerful on DVD Kingdom of Heaven Directors Cut) Scott wanted something lighter - an easy shoot in an idyllic location. The result is a mix of Sideways man-meets-wine infatuation and the Diane Lane endeavor Under the Tuscan Sun. Theres also a romance between a big city foreigner and a local girl that has been done more times than I can count. At least theres some originality in the way they meet as well as a cautionary note about standing on diving boards extending over empty swimming pools. Max Skinner (Russell Crowe) is a financial whiz based in London. Hes a self-proclaimed ""greedy bastard"" but that may be giving him too much credit for showing traits ascribed to human beings. His specialty is making money by screwing over others. In fact therein lies his only real talent. Take away his high-pressure world and hes lost. One day he receives word that his once-beloved uncle Henry (Albert Finney) has popped the cork on his final bottle of wine. Because there is no will Max as his closest living relative inherits his entire French estate which includes a dilapidated villa and a huge vineyard. Maxs intention is to unload it as quickly as possible for the best price he can get so he travels to France to put things in order. There assailed by memories of summers past (cue the flashbacks) and beguiled by the beauty of feisty Fanny (Marion Cotillard) he begins to lose his focus. Enter Kristy (Australian Abbie Cornish doing a flawless American accent) Henrys illegitimate daughter whose appearance introduces a new wrinkle - not only about the future of the vineyard but about Maxs standing as a man with no family. Russell Crowes bad-boy reputation serves him well in establishing Max as a jerk. The transformation to a younger version of Henry is believable because it happens gradually. (One could argue that making this statement gives away something about the trajectory of the plot but is there really any doubt?) Theres a connection between Crowe and co-star Marion Cotillard allowing us to accept this relationship. Their scenes together are some of the best in the movie. Albert Finney is in top form in the small but crucial role of Maxs childhood mentor whose lessons havent been forgotten just buried. As with all films that are ultimately about redemption the protagonist must first be established as someone in need of saving then as someone worth saving. Scott accomplishes the first aim with the scenes of Max in London coldly driving down the price of a stock by selling then buying when its at the bottom. The second objective is achieved via the sun-dappled flashbacks. Redemption comes from two sources the love of the land and the love of a woman. Its nice to know that even in a movie that fits the formula to a ""T"" Scott can get us to care about the characters and forget (if only momentarily) that we know how everything is going to turn out.

At first the habitually xenophobic Max struggles with Smart cars feisty women and salt of the earth local types in his callous attempts to sell off the property and get the hell back to Blighty but as quick as you can say moules marinieres hes prancing around in espadrilles and a powder blue workshirt with a newly acquired joie de vivre. Obligatory Proustian flashbacks (fleshed out by Finney and Freddie Highmore as the young Max) allow for a heartening glimpse of Maxs carefree childhood while Scott evokes the pastoral idyll of rural France by cluttering each shot with earthenware pots. Worst of all were supposed to be satisfied with the fact that Max eventually foregoes his multi-million pound salary in order to turn over a considerable profit on a vineyard that churns out award-winning wine. But wheres the life lesson in that? The film then deigns to espouse the abhorrent notion that (socialist readers look away now) if youre born a rich bastard youll die a rich bastard. Escapist dilettantes may find A Good Year light breezy and charming but even the most rudimentary inspection will reveal the films sickeningly rotten core.

A simple repast consisting of sometimes strained slapsticky comedy a sweet romance and a life lesson learned this little picnic doesnt amount to much but goes down easily enough to generate OK B.O. returns. A light rose from Ridley Scott compared to the hefty cabernets he usually turns out ""A Good Year"" is a divertissement an excuse for the filmmakers and cast to enjoy a couple of months in Provence and for the audience by proxy to spend a couple of hours there. A simple repast consisting of sometimes strained slapsticky comedy a sweet romance and a life lesson learned this little picnic doesnt amount to much but goes down easily enough to generate OK B.O. returns. Story of a rapacious London bonds trader tempted to opt out of the fast lane for life at an inherited chateau is more than a bit self-referential for both Scott and the source books author Peter Mayle. The two worked together in the advertising and commercials world 30 years ago with Mayle eventually giving it up to write books beginning with the massively successful ""A Year in Provence"" in 1991. Scott also has a home and vineyard in the area. So when the allure of the simple life is expressed here it is only on the most fantastic terms with the best wine food views and women already in place for instantaneous consumption. As a real-life fantasy its hard to beat; as a film its an agreeable slice of lifestyles-of-the-rich voyeurism. After a brief prologue devoted to conceited British boy Max (Freddie Highmore) being indoctrinated in the finer points of wine by his life-lusting Uncle Henry (Albert Finney) at the latters estate in the south of France Max (Russell Crowe) enters as an even more self-satisfied adult on the trading floor finessing a fantastic profit in one session that raises the ire of his rivals. Notified that his uncle has died and left him the chateau he flies down to wrap up the paperwork to facilitate a quick sale of the property which promises to net Max another small fortune. Heedless of the feelings of his uncles longtime winemaker Francis (Didier Bourdon) and the latters wife Ludivine (Isabelle Candelier) Max cares about nothing but money and winning and while in France relishes driving past a bunch of bicyclists and yelling gleefully at them ""Lance Armstrong"" Given that the estates little dog is named Tati and that clips from ""M. Hulots Holiday"" and ""Mon Oncle"" are glimpsed at one point its safe to assume Scott admires the great French comic filmmaker Jacques Tati. Along those lines Crowe takes quite a few pratfalls in the course of the film including one into a waterless swimming pool with walls too high to climb up a predicament that allows him to begin his sparring match with lovely local restaurant owner Fanny (Marion Cotillard) whos sworn off men. Rather than for its more rambunctious physicality pic is often more appealing in its throwaway asides such as the one in the pool when a filthy Max mincingly mutters the famous lines from ""Lawrence of Arabia"" about why Lawrence likes the desert ""Its clean. I like it because its clean."" A convenient job suspension keeps Max in Provence longer than planned long enough for the place to cast its spell upon him. One surprise is the arrival of Christie (Abbie Cornish) a beautiful girl from Napa coming to meet her biological father -- none other than the deceased Henry -- for the first time. French laws allowing claims of illegitimate children throw the inheritance into question while the mystery surrounding the source of a very pricey vin de garage as opposed to the lousy stuff openly grown on the property gives Max further pause. But in a story like this it can only be a woman who makes the blind man see the light. And so it is when Max and Fanny two young but hard souls -- who they figure out once met as children on the land -- finally come together in an endearing breakthrough scene extremely well played by Crowe and Cotillard. For a moment pic approaches a level of genuine intoxication. His hair smoothed and straightened into something like a 1920s look and outfitted with glasses much of the time Crowe executes a lightweight change of pace with his charisma entirely intact even if he still hasnt mastered an English accent that fits comfortably with Finneys or Highmores. There are moments when the enchanting Cotillard resembles a Gallic dark-haired Reese Witherspoon and Aussie thesp Cornish in her first Hollywood film continues her quick ascent with a perfect Yank accent and a nice note of observant reserve. The setting could hardly be made to look less than glorious and production standards are up to what one expects from a Scott picture. All the same lensing is not as resplendent as it might have been; numerous shots sharing bright and dark areas arent well balanced and faces are sometimes underlit. The soundtrack fleshed out with an eclectic array of tunes is lively.
