It imagines the making of Irelands national treasure The Book of Kells - a medieval manuscript illustrating the four Gospels. If that sounds monastic and staid the film is anything but. It mines Celtic folklore and fairy tale as much as history and begins with a goose-chase literally. Twelve-year-old Brandon dashes after the querulous bird to pluck a few feathers for quills. His uncle the abbot (voiced by Brendan Gleeson) is building a wall around the monastery as sanctuary from the Vikings but Brandon would rather be in the scriptorium where a jolly gang of monks are illustrating scripts.The mostly hand-drawn animation takes its cues from medieval art gloriously ornate and antique with spiralling curlicues Celtic symbols - and all very flat. The Vikings are terrifying not men at all but abstract headstone-like demons. Fleeing these north men master illuminator Brother Aidan arrives at the monastery carrying the book. Flowing white hair long robes a glint in the eye Aidan has the patter of a saintly bookie. Like all grown-ups he has huge hands and fingers and there is a lovely message about craft and discovering the wonder of art and nature.Aidan takes Brendan under his wing sending him into a forest where he meets Aisling a fairy-like wolf girl. Carpeted with bluebells the forest is a joy full of fat little birds and teeming with butterflies and owls. The animators show the change of seasons blackened snow in winter russet leaves fluttering in autumn. That must have added a huge burden to already painstaking work and shows what a labour of love this film surely was for director Tomm Moore. The story is a bit tangled and there is too much of it packed into nearly 80 minutes but little kids wont be bothered when the animation is so magical. Older ones may get restless.

Firstly the drawings are simply amazing and only the beauty of the animation would make the movie worth seeing. Secondly the story - although sometimes a bit erratic - about conquering ones own fears for a higher purpose is very edifying ans courageous. Highly recommended it might be a bit scary for the very young.

The northmen in The Secret of Kells represent the forces of evil. Photo CARTOON SALOON The Secret of Kells 1 / 1 Back to Gallery In these boom times for 3-D moviemaking The Secret of Kells is flat and proud of it. Its hand-drawn two-dimensional animation springs to life with color and meticulous technique filigreed and curlicued like the luminous book at its center. On the downside its characters lack depth (figuratively as well as literally) and the plot is standard fare for a family-friendly historical saga Brave orphan teams up with old coot and young sprite to rescue civilization from encroaching darkness. Adding a dash of the exotic is the storys setting in a ninth-century Irish monastery where boy monk Brendan (the voice of Evan McGuire) rushes to help master illuminator Aidan (Mick Lally) complete the holy book of Kells before rampaging armies of Norsemen lay waste to all they know. Helping Brendan Aisling (Christen Mooney) a mysterious wee girl (or is she?) he meets in the woods. Not helping Brendan his uncle the Abbot (Brendan Gleeson) an imperious worrier whos preoccupied with fortifying the walls around the abbey. The tension between idealism and pragmatism between dreamer and builder mounts as Aidan teaches Brendan the ins and outs of illuminated manuscripts. The faith they have in a single book --""a beacon in the dark days of the northmen"" -- proves infectious and lifts the movie with flights of thrilling visual invention. Directed by Tomm Moore and Nora Twomey The Secret of Kells lavishes attention on its stylized backgrounds and details Aislings glorious forest swirling with butterflies and leaves; mazelike tangles of Celtic imagery; a serpentine monster that kinks like the borders on a page. The artwork is the star of the film as well it should be; theres no sense making an ugly movie about a medieval tome renowned for its history and beauty. Nevertheless the directors and screenwriter (Fabrice Ziolkowski) might have spilled more ink on some of their human characters who look like minimalist cutouts from Saturday-morning cartoons. Squeezed in among all the Irish brothers at Kells are a few exhausted cliches an enormous African a philosophizing German and a jolly Italian who sounds like a refugee from an old Ragu commercial. At least they get faces. The invaders from the north appear as beady-eyed shadows with horns snarling abstractions that represent the larger forces of evil. (A historical aside thats been itching at me since How to Train Your Dragon The Vikings did not in fact wear horned helmets.) The Secret of Kellssnagged an Oscar nod this year for best animated feature an award it had zero hope of winning in a field crammed with unusually fine examples of the genre. But you can see why it was nominated notwithstanding the slightness of its characters and the slimness of its plot. In its small stubborn way the film is a love letter to traditions that have endured since cave dwellers painted the walls at Lascaux. Its own breathtaking artistry is a tribute to the steady hands that drew the Book of Kells -- and the steady hands that keep at it today realizing whole worlds from blank pages. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Columbia Mens/Womens Vent Cush Flip Sandals for 15 + free...

Now that this winsome marvelously illustrated folk tale has arrived in domestic theaters its easy to see why it dazzled the technicians and artists who nominated it although its not nearly as accomplished narratively as it is visually. This StoryThe Secret of Kells Feast for eyes not the mindFind The Secret of Kells showtimesWatch the trailer The story has to do with a young boy named Brendan living in Ireland during the Middle Ages a time of mystical superstitions and barbarian threats from the north. When Brendans village is visited by a master book illuminator who carries with him a mysterious unfinished book the 12-year-old vows to help him complete the tome a promise that involves the boys venturing into a forbidding forest outside the village wall and meeting a beguiling sprite prone to shape-shifting into a white wolf. At least I think thats what happens. ""The Secret of Kells"" is so talky and obscure that its difficult to know with any certainty whats going on at any given moment. But the colors and images of this vividly imagined tale are striking enough that its storytelling sense barely matters. With its rhythmic lines and beautiful color palette the film presents one treat for the eye after another inviting filmgoers into a world as much inspired by mid-century design as medieval illustration. If filmgoers ultimately feel bogged down in its densely layered fable and allegory its a spectacular thicket to get lost in.  1/2 Unrated. At Landmarks E Street Cinema.

Warner Bros. By Joe Morgenstern Updated April 2 2010 1201 a.m. ET A few more 3-D spectacles like ""Clash of the Titans"" and audiences will be clamoring for 2-D. Whats wrong with this sad fiasco goes far beyond its visual deficits but lets start there. The film a remake of a 1981 action fantasy loosely based on Greek mythology was shot with conventional cameras then hastily reprocessed into an approximation of 3-D in the wake of the stunning success of ""Avatar."" The result is 2.5-D a murkily virtual virtuality. You get an ambiguous sense of depth at a steep price that includes but isnt confined to the box-office surcharge that the studios have begun to impose on such attractions in a sudden frenzy of delusion and greed. Watch a clip from ""Clash of the Titans"" a remake of the cult classic featuring giant scorpions harpies blind witches Greek Goods and Liam Neeson in a shiny suit of armor. Video courtesy of Warner Bros. First of all the glasses you use to watch this production sit heavily on the nose--their so-called active-shutter technology involves built-in electronics--and they soak up so much light that day scenes turn into an unintended twilight of the gods while night scenes look as if someone forgot to light the set. Figures in the foreground range from partially modeled to inexplicably flat while computer-generated effects are occasionally impressive (the beheading of Medusa) but mostly indifferent (a big gold coin thats scaled out over the audience doesnt make it past the first few rows). Whats more the visual murk creates emotional murk; the experience is such a downer that its hard to find moments of up. Now living in a democracy means youre free to take the glasses off at any time without fear of retribution from Warner Bros. or the exhibitors. (Youre also free to choose a theater thats showing a 2-D version.) I removed mine after 40 minutes and discovered that the images on the screen were not only bright but reasonably sharp so the glasses stayed in my lap for the duration. Yet bright images cant sustain the illusion of life without drama and in that respect ""Clash of the Titans"" which was directed by Louis Letterier is strictly no-D. Sam Worthington--most recently and multidimensionally of ""Avatar""--is Perseus born of a god but raised as a man and pretty much played as a block of wood. ""I dont know why I was born or what I am"" he laments at one point and you can relate since the movie doesnt know what to do with him. Hes sent on endless battles to defeat Hades (Ralph Fiennes whispering and simpering) before that misshapen wretch can seize power from his fatuous brother Zeus (Liam Neeson squirming and declaiming) and turn the earth into a living hell. Having established Perseus as a fearless hunk however the misshapen script wont give him a girl to love. Hes got a beautiful guide in Gemma Artertons Io; she turns up every now and then to say do this dont do that or go this way instead of that way. Yet theres no chemistry between them because chemistry requires proximity and Io seems to be operating on some ethereal plane. (Though she could be just another victim of the disorienting photography.) And in a masterstroke of dramatic perversity Io is given to Perseus--as a gift from the gods--just before the movie ends. Presumably hell enjoy her but we dont get to watch. ENLARGE Liam Hemsworth and Miley Cyrus in The Last Song. Touchstone Pictures The Last Song Disney has a lot riding on ""The Last Song"" a romantic tale that brings Miley Cyrus out of her preteen--and immensely profitable--Hannah Montana phase into the role of an amorous teenage girl. Many of the early reviews have heaped scorn on the film some aspects of which invite it. For one thing this is second-tier melodrama from Nicholas Sparks deaths favorite franchisee so the cliches come moist and shameless. For another Ms. Cyruss Ronnie Miller a piano prodigy living in New York with her mother and little brother must get through lots of anger at having to spend a summer in coastal Georgia with her estranged father whos played by Greg Kinnear. Thats a really bad idea. The young star doesnt yet have the skill to play anger interestingly and the director Julie Anne Robinson hasnt helped matters by keeping the camera on her face during tight-jawed glowers that sometimes stay fixed for the full length of a scene. Speakeasy The Last Song Tests Miley Cyrus Nicholas Sparks Box Office Appeal Nevertheless and at the risk of inviting scorn too I must say that ""The Last Song"" takes a sharp turn for the better when Ronnie and a poor big rich boy played by Liam Hemsworth fall in love. Hes handsome and charming while she becomes sweet and endearing. ""Youre not like other girls"" he tells her; its believable because she believes it. Some of the sappiness must be seen to be believed--a clumsy subplot involving violence and arson an ecologically correct salute to cute sea turtle hatchlings. But the movie moves Ms. Cyrus from where she was to more or less where she and her handlers wanted to be and Mr. Kinnears musician father Steve adds a generous measure of grace. Instead of telling Ronnie that shes not like other girls Steve tells her with genuine poignancy that she doesnt yet know who she is. Its an expression of faith that shell soon find out and that the discovery will delight her. The Secret of Kells ENLARGE A scene from The Secret of Kells. GKIDS From our vantage point--or disadvantage point--in time its impossible to project ourselves into the minds of the medieval monks who created the Book of Kells the magnificently illuminated manuscript that spent centuries at the Abbey of Kells and can currently be seen and studied at the Trinity College Library in Dublin. Were they performing an act of pure devotion or pursuing beauty as well? Theres no mystery though about why the people who made ""The Secret of Kells"" did what they did. This wonderfully strange and exquisite little feature was created especially for young children to celebrate the book through another kind of illumination thats been falling into disuse--hand-drawn animation. The story concerns a Celtic boy named Brendan who helps a master illuminator finish the book then protects it from Viking marauders. (The director was Tomm Moore and the co-director was Nora Twomey.) But the soul of the film lies in its ravishing colors and in exuberantly stylized images that pay homage to Celtic culture and design together with techniques and motifs that evoke Matisse Miyazaki and the minimalist cartoons of UPA. Since the emphasis is more on graphic variety than continuity theres almost a sense of too-muchness but thats fine; its another expression of devotion. Find related television listings at LocateTV. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS ENLARGE In Bruges (2008) Ralph Fiennes is the scarily explosive boss of two hit men played by Brendan Gleeson (who voiced Abbot Cellach in ""The Secret of Kells"") and Colin Farrell. He sends them to Bruges with instructions to wait--not for Godot though theres a bit of that feeling but for further instructions about who gets killed next. The violence can be shocking but Martin McDonaghs film is also very funny and a morality play thats deeply affecting. Jordan Prentice is a racist dwarf and Clemence Poesy plays Chloe a woman who is not but also is the person she seems to be. ENLARGE Little Miss Sunshine (2006) A dysfunctional-family comedy with a difference--the function progresses from dys to full and loving. Seven-year-old Olive (Abigail Breslin) wants to compete for the title of Little Miss Sunshine in the California contest of the same name. To do so however she must mobilize her family a quarrelsome but entertaining group of depressives. Greg Kinnear is Olives father Richard a motivational speaker whose own will to win is following his career down the drain. The cast includes Toni Collette Steve Carell and Alan Arkin. Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris directed from an original screenplay by Michael Arndt. ENLARGE The Triplets of Belleville (2003) One viewing isnt enough to take in the eccentric pleasures of Sylvain Chomets animated feature. (Two of its producers Didier Brunner and Viviane Vanfleteren served in similar capacities on ""The Secret of Kells."") The absence of conventional dialogue helps draw one into the amusing and moving world of a club-footed grandmother her spoke-thin bicycle-racer grandson and the three old crones of the title.

The film was nominated for an Academy Award. ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Secret of Kells   1/2 (out of four)Voices Evan McGuire Christen Mooney Brendan Gleeson Mick LallyDirector Tomm Moore and Nora TwomeyDistributor GKids Inc.UnratedRunning time 1 hour 15 minutesExpands Friday to select cities By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The Secret of Kells is a magical adventure unlike anything weve seen on screen before. Vivid colors are burnished in a way that seems to bring new light to the art form. It almost seems as if a few new hues were invented by Irish directors Tomm Moore and Nora Twomey and their animators. The story fanciful and captivating as it is is less impressive than the gorgeous visuals. But its emphasis on promoting humanity in dark times and the transcendent value of imagination and artistry is uplifting. Its little wonder that members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences chose this barely seen gem for one of its Oscar nominees for 2009s best animated feature. Red-haired Brendan voiced by Evan McGuire is a 12-year-old novice who lives in the Abbey of Kells a heavily fortified medieval outpost. The threat of Viking raids has kept him and the monks sequestered on the abbey so he has never ventured outside of its walls. As the youngest member of the abbey Brendan is characterized by the wise Brother Aidan (Mick Lally) as ""a little brother with big questions."" Brother Aidan has come to Kells with a sacred but unfinished book of knowledge a compendium he refers to as ""a beacon in these dark days"" of barbarous sieges. Brendan is enthralled. The older monks aging hands are too unsteady to finish the manuscript and he asks Brendan to help. To finish the book Brendan must undertake a perilous quest through an enchanted forest. In that forest is Aisling (Christen Mooney) a mysterious woodland fairy who assists him in his mission. The forest is a gorgeous but terrifying place. Brendan must face his darkest fears but his dedication lights his path. The mostly hand-drawn animation captures the art of the medieval era augmented occasionally by computer animation. Scenes feature intricate Celtic designs in riotous colors worked into the landscape and elsewhere including axe handles tree bark scaffolding and faces. The films vibrant and melodious Irish folk-flavored musical score heightens the overall enchanting quality. This beautifully drawn adventure will resonate with all ages -- with an involving story and appropriate message for the youngest audiences as well as striking imagery to captivate those far older.

"Secret of Kells comes to life with bright imaginative spirit - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMOVIE REVIEW Secret of Kells comes to life with bright imaginative spiritHand-drawn animated film from Ireland was an Oscar nominee and its clear to see why.April 02 2010|By KENNETH TURAN | Film Critic ""The Secret of Kells"" is an anachronism many times over and what a good thing that turned out to be. A ravishing continually surprising example of largely hand-drawn animation in the heyday of computer-generated imagery an inexpensive and sophisticated European production in an age of broad-stroke studio films even a spirited defense of books and bookishness while Kindles walk the earth ""Kells"" fights the tide every way it can. Yet this longshot that began as a college project for Irish director Tomm Moore edged Hayao Miyazakis ""Ponyo"" for one of five feature animation Oscar nominations and in a year without Pixars ""Up"" might even have won. Thats how magical this story of a boy and a book turned out to be. The book is the Book of Kells a circa AD 800 illuminated manuscript whose recounting of the four gospels was so dazzlingly decorated and illustrated (in part by the monks at the abbey of Kells) that its universally regarded as one of Irelands national treasures. ""The Secret of Kells"" co-directed by Nora Twomey is a fable-like tale of how that book might have come to be completed involving the stern Abbot Cellach (voiced by Brendan Gleeson) the master illuminator Brother Aidan (Mick Lally) and the 12-year-old Brendan (Evan McGuire) ""the little brother with the big questions"" whose pluck and fortitude end up saving the day -- with a little help from some woodland friends. But though ""Kells "" story (by director Moore) and screenplay (by Fabrice Ziolkowski) are delightful the narrative itself is only part of the reason for the success of a film that is a tribute to and an example of the power of the imagination an enterprise that insists that what the mind imagines the hand can achieve. The heart of everything not surprisingly is that marvelous visual style not only heavily Celtic influenced but also a glorious throwback to the more stylized painterly work of decades past the kind of vividly colored fanciful pictorials that are usually confined to the small-scale realm of animated shorts. Also breaking out of boundaries is the spirit of this film which has room for multiple approaches. The main sensibility is light on its feet even playful -- Brendan chases a goose as it turns out not to kill it but to pluck feathers for quills -- and theres a sense of gentle fun about the proceedings that is tonic to experience. But this easy nature also admits to the presence of evil both the flesh and blood malevolence of invading Norsemen looking like animated versions of the barbarians in Eisensteins ""Alexander Nevsky"" and the more mythological evil of dark forces that dwell in the murky depths of the forests. Because he sees the forest as dark and threatening the severe unbending Abbot of Kells has decreed that young Brendan cannot go outside the enormous walls that hes building around the abbey in the hope that they will keep the invaders at bay. All this changes when Brother Aidan a charismatic master illuminator whose work is of such high quality that ""its capable of turning darkness into light"" shows up at Kells with a book he began illustrating on the island of Iona before the marauding Norsemen made him flee. Very much attracted to the making of art Brendan overcomes his fears and the abbots strictures to go into the forest in search of berries that Brother Aidan needs to make one of the manuscripts especially vivid colors. Deep in those trees Brendan meets the marvelous fairy Aisling (Christen Mooney) both young girl and wolf who introduces him -- and us -- to the glowing wonders of the forest a place of pagan delights but also as it turns out the lair of Crom Cruach a legendary monster who also has a place in the Kells saga. With a firm footing in all these worlds -- blissfully pagan devoutly Christian and darkly monstrous -- ""The Secret of Kells"" teaches important lessons in the most casual joyful way. How it manages to do that is probably the biggest secret of all. kenneth.turanlatimes .com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESNew on DVD The Karate Kid and A Nightmare on Elm StreetOctober 3 2010Hells Angel Sonny Bargers guide to motorcyclingJuly 6 2010Ancient book inspires classic animation of The Secret of...March 31 2010The Secret of Kells the little animated film that couldFebruary 10 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesReviewEntertainmentSecretCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-kells2-2010apr02,0,6599746.story",200,thesecretofkells6,thesecretofkells,latimes

Comments (3) The Secret of Kells Recommended Watch on Amazon Watch on Netflix Watch on Hulu 75 minutes  2009 The conventional wisdom in the movie business holds that 2-D animation is headed for the junkyard of history. Ironically the best 2-D features to come along in recent years have all taken inspiration from pre-Renaissance art and design for Michel Ocelots Azur amp; Asmar (2006) that art was Islamic for Nina Paleys Sita Sings the Blues (2008) it was Hindu and for Tomm Moores The Secret of Kells (2009) its the Celtic illumination of the Book of Kells. Made for a relatively paltry 8 million this Irish feature wont impress anyone with its character drawings which arent much more detailed or emotionally nuanced than youd find in a 60s holiday special by Rankin/Bass. But the backgrounds are another story. As richly hued and ornately patterned as their ninth-century models they remind us what stunning imagery once resulted from nothing more than a pen and all the time in the world. By J.R.

Whats this? The Secret of Kells?It turns out the Oscars nominating committee had every reason to honor this dark horse a little-known endeavor heretofore unreleased in the States. A beautiful retro-style hand-drawn feature from Ireland combining elements of 1950s and 60s Disney toons (geometric graphics flat painterly backgrounds) and traditional Celtic art (intricate luminously colorful patterns) this spirited childrens adventure set in the Middle Ages offers both visual and narrative thrills.Drawing (so to speak) from fairy tales and illuminated medieval manuscripts The Secret of Kells is about a young boy Brendan (the voice of Evan McGuire) who lives in a fortified abbey under threat of invasion by Vikings. When master illuminator Brother Aidan (Mick Lally) arrives he enlists Brendan to venture beyond the abbeys walls to collect oak berries in the forest to use for ink in the scriptorium. This innocent-seeming mission turns into an epic quest involving magical fairies a wolf-girl and a cat with two different-colored eyes.The Secret of Kells is gorgeous work and its imagery and themes dovetail perfectly a story about creating art artfully created.Contact movie critic Steven Reaat 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + The Secret of Kells was the wild card in the recent Oscar animation race -- the little Irish movie no one had heard of let alone seen. Call it luck or a brilliant promotional strategy but the movie opens at the Kendall today with local animaniacs primed to happily pounce. As well they should for ""Kells is a visually overwhelming labor of love a hand-drawn medieval adventure tale that seeks and finds cosmic connections.Yes you can still bring the kids. The hero of ""Kells is Brendan (voiced by Evan Maguire) a young boy who has been apprenticed to his forbidding uncle the Abbott of Kells (Brendan Gleeson) and ordered never to leave the monastery. There are enough dangers out there -- wolves eldritch Celtic gods rampaging Vikings -- that the Abbott is obsessively building high walls to protect the monks and the illuminated manuscripts upon which they labor.Theres a real Book of Kells -- a 9th-century version of the New Testament renowned for its brilliant ornamentation its considered Irelands national treasure -- but it probably wasnt created this way. The monks in ""The Secret of Kells are a consciously international lot and drawn by Tomm Moore with geometric glee a big domelike African a toadstool-size Asian a spherical Italian. The Abbott is a rectangular figure of authority all corners no curves. Brendan blessedly is a kid although the lines of medieval il lustration lift his face into a smile.The appearance of Brother Aidan (Mick Lally) a puckish renegade fleeing the invaders kicks the plot into gear. He encourages Brendans reckless artistic side and sends the boy out to the forest to gather materials for ink. There the movie lifts off into a Celtic eco-pantheism not far in feel from the work of Hayao Miyazaki (""Spirited Away ""Ponyo). Brendan befriends Aisling (Christen Mooney) a forest wild girl with mysterious connections to the animals plants and Druidic forces. On the plot level then ""The Secret of Kells is a kiddie adventure with twists and turns recognizable to fans of anime and the more adventurous US animation.On the visual level the film is on a higher plane entirely. Moore roots ""Kells in the limited perspectives of medieval art -- often to delightful effect -- but the film keeps bursting into repeated patterns and motifs that dazzle the eye and that by the climax are consciously fractal a vision of worlds within worlds within worlds. The movie belongs in the recent vanguard of arthouse animation along with Michel Ocelots ""Azur and Asmar and Nina Paleys ""Sita Sings the Blues -- astonishing (and primarily hand-drawn) works that push the envelope of what the medium can do. The climactic sequence in which the Vikings finally attack might scare small fry if it werent so surreally almost mathematically beautiful.Admittedly there has to be a bit of bait-and-switch in any story about the creation of an iconic Christian text that doesnt actually mention Jesus Christ (even if the grown Brendan does look quite beatific by the films final scenes). ""The Secret of Kells uses early Christian theology to access a wider more universal sense of wonder -- its a movie in which even the molecules feel illuminated.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

I mean the kind of drawing that monks did in the Middle Ages; those curlicued borders and ornate letters they hand-painted in holy books. In Irelands Book of Kells for instance -- a 9th-century volume that took many monks many years to illuminate. In the film theres a nod to traditional lore indicating that the manuscript originated at a Scottish abbey in Iona and was then brought to Kells where the illuminations were added. Its arrival thrills a young apprentice named Brendan whos asked not just to help pluck goose quills for the other monks and find the right berries to make green ink but also to do some of the drawing as they rush to complete the volume. Meanwhile the abbot who happens to be Brendans uncle is rushing to complete something he regards as more important than the book -- a wall to repel Vikings. The artists protest that without books knowledge will perish; he counters that without walls theyll all perish. ""It is with the strength of our walls"" he says ""that they will come to trust the strength of our faith."" Now this qualifies as pretty heady stuff in a kid-flick world thats generally most comfortable with talking frogs singing chipmunks and balloon trips. That medieval abbeys protected knowledge is historical of course -- the wisdom collected there helped Europe rebuild after the Dark Ages -- but you wouldnt want the film to spend all its time on that. So Brendan slips out into the woods where he meets a helpful sprite and a nasty monster giving the animators a chance to play with form and format until the Vikings attack. i Abbot Cellach (voiced by Brendan Gleeson) finds himself torn between conflicting imperatives shoring up the abbeys defenses and completing a mystical illuminated manuscript. GKIDS/Cartoon Saloon hide caption toggle caption GKIDS/Cartoon Saloon Abbot Cellach (voiced by Brendan Gleeson) finds himself torn between conflicting imperatives shoring up the abbeys defenses and completing a mystical illuminated manuscript. GKIDS/Cartoon Saloon The visual style the filmmakers have chosen is striking and quite beautiful at times but deliberately flat like pictures in a medieval manuscript. Theres no 3-D trickery no moving backgrounds. Trees are stylized people geometric (one monk is triangular another is essentially a curve with a bald patch) and the movement is as primitive as in Saturday morning cartoons. When you think that at the Oscars The Secret of Kells is going up against Up its chances seem slim -- and probably are. But theres something kind of captivating about a film thats been painstakingly drawn to glorify the craft of illustration and thats comfortable using retro techniques. Because after all what else makes sense for bringing to life the gold and scarlet ornamentation in ancient manuscripts? I confess I actually choked up when that ornamentation came briefly to life in the films final moments. Its low-tech but high art -- the secret to The Secret of Kells.

The biggest surprise when Oscar nomi nations were an nounced came when ""The Secret of Kells"" an obscure Irish-French-Belgian co-production scored a nod for Best Animated Feature squeezing out such high-profile contenders as ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" ""Ponyo"" ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"" and ""A Christmas Carol."" Its easy to see how the animation nominators fell in love with this charmer based on Celtic mythology which is quite unlike anything Ive ever seen before. You probably cant get more retro than artwork inspired by illuminated manuscripts from the Middle Ages -- except maybe by using cave paintings. These manuscripts also happen to be the obsession of the movies hero Brendan (voiced by Evan McGuire) an orphaned pre-teen novice at a monastery in Kells Ireland. Brendans stern uncle the Abbot Cellach (Brendan Gleeson) is building a wall to keep out invading Vikings. But when an elderly Scottish illustrator (Mick Lally) arrives with a jewel-encrusted unfinished book of the four gospels Brendan offers to sneak out in the forest in search of special berries to make ink. His dangerous quest includes an encounter with Aisling (Christen Moon- ey) a white wolf-fairy and other mystical creatures. Mostly hand-drawn with a few digital effects ""The Secret of Kells"" is not only not in 3-D -- the images are so deliberately flat that they often seem less than 2-D. Theyre also incredibly detailed and abstracted -- not that the climactic Viking attack isnt so vivid that it may frighten some of the younger children to whom this movie is apparently being marketed. ""The Secret of Kells"" well directed by Tomm Moore will likely appeal to older fans of fantasy and animation.

Refreshingly different precisely because its look is so profoundly retro ""Brendan and the Secret of Kells"" harks back not just to older animation styles but to pre-medieval illuminated manuscript tradition. With its jewel-bright colors and intricate use of lines the result is absolutely luscious to behold. Evoking the simplified drawings of childrens books the pic will most please the underserved 3- to 10-year-old demographic (even though bits are quite scary) and parents but older kids may be sniffier especially given the earnest joke-light screenplay. Theatrical prospects even in Europe look tricky but ""Brendan"" could reap lots of ancillary coin. Set sometime during the ninth century the story revolves around young Brendan (voiced by Evan McGuire) a roughly 10-year-old novice who lives in the abbey in Kells Ireland. Brendan loves helping the monks (a multicultural gang that includes an African and an Asian in a slightly too-PC touch) in the abbeys scriptorium as they illustrate the gospels. But Brendans uncle Abbot Cellach (Brendan Gleeson) wants him to devote more energy to help build up the abbeys walls to protect the community from Viking invasions. Given the Nordic threat and the fact the surrounding woods are said to be enchanted Brendans going outside the wall is strictly forbidden -- and of course a plot inevitability. Seeking refuge from the Vikings renowned Scottish illustrator Brother Aidan (Mick Lally) with his fluffy feline friend Pangur Ban arrives in Kells bearing his masterpiece the lavishly wrought but still unfinished Book of Iona. Inspired by the master Brendan becomes even keener to help complete the book but that would require gathering special berries for ink in the forest thus risking confrontation with the demons rumored to dwell there. Debutant feature helmer Tomm Moore and the pics hordes of animators drew most of the characters by hand (although its easy to spot where CGI has been used as a supplementary tool). Their approach produces a pleasingly ye-olde-world-y look that plays off the simplified UPA-studio-meets-the-Dark-Ages characters with intricate Celtic design-inspired detailing especially when the book literally comes to life. Space is distorted so that everything looks deliberately flattened yet theres a very high level of craft deployed throughout to build up patterns within patterns. This may be the perfect film for children whose parents are art historians specializing in pre-Renaissance periods. Thats not to say others wont enjoy it but finding an aud is going to be a challenge for marketing departments. Despite the many participants from across Europe listed in the credits the pics most fruitful territory is likely to be Ireland and even there competition with Hollywood fare will still be tough.
