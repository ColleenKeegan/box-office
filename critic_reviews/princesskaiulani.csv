Princess Kaiulani (PG) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Princess Kaiulani (PG) A returning princess is Hawaiis last hope in this biopic. Share Print Save to your profile By Carrie Rickey Philadelphia Inquirer6/10/2010 Editor rating 2 Qorianka Kilcher has a planar face and poised carriage that suggest her innate nobility. The actress whose own heritage is Peruvian and German memorably played Pocahontas in The New World. In Princess Kaiulani about the people of Hawaiis last hope against eventual U.S. annexation the actress seems destined to portray forthright heroines who bridge indigenous and colonial cultures. Kilcher is lovely. But sadly Kaiulani is a perfunctory biopic of the sort one might encounter on television during Womens History Month. The film hops from incident to incident emphasizing the princess education in Victorian England at the expense of making clear the European and U.S. business interests that unseated the Hawaiian royals. Next to Kilchers commanding and multidimensional presence the conniving Americans (Barry Pepper as Lorrin Thurston agitator for Hawaiis American statehood and Will Patton as his confederate Sanford Dole cousin of the pineapple magnate) look like paper dolls. Marc Forby wrote the screenplay and makes his directorial debut with this girl-power story contrasting the shell-strewn coastline of Oahu with the manicured lawns of Englands stately homes. Except for the scenery and Kilcher the first two-thirds of this 130-minute film are a yawn. Belatedly it stirs when Kaiulani leaves England for the United States and gently lobbies President Grover Cleveland to extend American democracy to the newly annexed island kingdom.

Young graceful revered by her people and by the way drop-dead gorgeous she embodied both the hope of her country and the clipped Victorian etiquette of that other island nation -- the one just a bit to the north and half-way around the globe -- where she spent several years in exile in the late 19th century. Princess Kaiulani attempts to do her justice. It succeeds in part presenting its heroine as a courageous impassioned advocate for sovereignty and civil rights when American interests were busy muscling Hawaiians toward annexation. Its also beautifully shot sun-kissed and meticulous with period detail. But as a story -- as Kaiulanis story -- it falls flat having collapsed under the weight of the genres mushier conventions. There are too many swooping violins too many trite generalizations too few moments that throw a light on history and turn it into art. Directed produced and co-written by British filmmaker Marc Forby (an exec producer on the Prom Night slasher remake if that helps) Princess Kaiulani opens with a long hunk of narration outlining the dappled girlhood and future role of one Victoria Kaiulani Kalaninuiahilapalapa Kawekiu i Lunalilo Cleghorn. The daughter of a short-lived princess (a sister to the queen) and a Scottish financier Kaiulani is portrayed by the American actress Qorianka Kilcher -- whom eagle-eyed viewers will recognize as Pocahontas from Terrence Malicks The New World. If Kilcher has a gift for aboriginal royalty (talk about niche specialties) it has less to do with her Quechuan German heritage than the grief in her eyes and the mettle in her bearing. Both suit her better during her scenes in Hawaii and at the White House where Kaiulani makes a case for nationhood than in her many gluey tete-a-tetes with a dashing Brit ( Shaun Evans ). There isnt a whole lot of meat here; despite a few evocative scenes much of the plot is fluff. At the beginning Kaiulani is happily ensconced in Hawaii. Then a coup detat occurs and shes semi-happily ensconced in Britain. But political machinations and continued violent upheaval on her distant island home endanger that semi-happiness arousing the fierce love of a princess for her people. Kilchers castmates breathe what life they can into a stock array of roles. The best of the lot is Barry Pepper as conniving businessman Lorrin Thurston who cuts and darts through crowd settings like a shark through kelp. Will Patton oozes weakness (later a hesitant resolve) as the politician Sanford Dole one of Thurstons allies in a series of constitutional and military takeovers that disenfranchised native Hawaiians. Princess Kaiulanis original title was the pointedly shocking Barbarian Princess a direct reference to the prejudice of the time. The film itself addresses some of that bigotry -- and some of the tensions facing a young Hawaiian princess named for an English queen. Its a minor look at a much-cherished figure in history. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Bass Pro Shops Clearance Sale Deals from 1 + free shipping w/...

By Peter Rainer Film critic May 14 2010 Save for later Saved First-time writer-director Marc Forbys ""Princess Kaiulani"" is a stodgy period piece about the USs annexation of Hawaii in 1898 and the Hawaiian princess who fought and finessed for her people and died at 23 from what the film says was ""a broken heart at the loss of her country."" Kaiulanis father was Scottish her mother Hawaiian and she was put through the British school system before returning to the hoopla of her homeland and facing off against colonialists and imperialists of all stripes. All of this and more is presented in History Channel-style lock step. As the doomed princess Qorianka Kilcher who costarred as Pocahontas in Terence Malicks ""The New World"" has imperially striking features but limited acting skills. If her performances should ever rise to the level of her looks shell be great. Grade C- (Rated PG for some violence and thematic material and for brief language sensuality and smoking.)

Starring Qorianka Kilcher Barry Pepper Will Patton Shaun Evans Jimmy Yuill Julian Glover Tamzin Merchant Catherine Steadman Kainoa Kilcher Director Marc Forby Running time 210 Release Opened May 21 2010  Editorial Review Hormones overtake historyBy Rachel SaslowFriday May 21 2010Its safe to assume that most Americans dont often think about how Hawaii became a U.S. territory -- if they ever learned the story in the first place. Its a sad but familiar tale White men come to a resources-rich strategically located nation deem its inhabitants ""barbarians"" and take over.Thats the backdrop for ""Princess Kaiulani"" an uneven film that by trying to satisfy parents with political drama and older children with a love story leaves both parties wanting.The film which is based on real events opens in 1889 with the young princess (Qorianka Kilcher) collecting shells on the beach. We learn through a narrator that Kaiulanis mother has died the first of many hardships of the princesss life. Soon rebels linked to the U.S. government try to overthrow the monarchy and Kaiulanis father who is Scottish whisks her away to safety in England. The princess is devastated and mopes around her new Victorian bedroom carefully laying out seashells that she collected with her mother on her bedspread and crying. In England she faces racial slurs at school and at social events people stare at her and ask demeaning questions such as ""Do you read and write?""She falls in love with a British boy named Clive (Shaun Evans) and an interminable sequence of scenes of them giggling and making out begins interrupted only by googly eyes and barfarific dialogue.The film gets more interesting when the political situation heats up in Hawaii and Kaiulani travels to the United States where she must charm journalists and President Grover Cleveland in order to protect the interests of her people. In the process she transitions into a poised stateswoman fighting for suffrage for Hawaiian natives.Viewers who are interested in issues of colonialism and Native American rights will probably roll their eyes at the slow formulaic romance between Kaiulani and Clive. Younger viewers perhaps drawn in by the promise of a princess story will squirm through the diplomatic scenes which they probably wont understand.The tagline on the movie posters is ""her heart was torn between love and the future of Hawaii."" Evidently so were the filmmakers.Contains some violence brief foul language sensuality and smoking.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Watching ""Princess Kaiulani youre not sure whether to weep for the title character or the actress playing her.It cant be easy to turn the story of Hawaiis last royal into a waxworks parade but writer-director Marc Forby has pulled it off. The film wants us to get good and outraged over the island kingdoms annexation at the hands of US businessmen in the 1890s and to cheer on the exquisitely poised young woman who swayed public opinion against them. Its difficult to get stirred up though when the filmmakings this banal.The real Princess Kaiulani -- full name Victoria Kaiulani Kalaninuiahilapalapa Kawekiu i Lunalilo Cleghorn -- was the daughter of a native princess and the last Royal Governor of Oahu. At 13 she was sent to England to be educated for her eventual ascension to the throne but US interests engineered the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy during her absence in 1893. Kaiulani toured the United States in support of her country lunching with President Grover Cleveland and winning over the press with her elegance and Paris gowns but she ultimately made little headway. Hawaii formally became a US territory in 1898.What drama isnt in this story Forby and cowriter Robert Payne invent including a young and ardent British love interest named Clive (Shaun Evans). Almost all the films real urgency though resides in the face of Qorianka Kilcher who plays the princess. You remember Kilcher dont you? The untutored Los Angeles teenager cast as Pocahontas in Terrence Malicks brilliant misunderstood ""The New World? This is only the actresss second role and its depressing to think that her lot may be forever to play royal personages of color. Theres more there even if its still not clear what that more might be.Insofar as the script allows her Kilcher plays Kaiulani as a girl maturing into a woman and a politician surviving racism in England and the smug jingoism of Lorrin Thurston (Barry Pepper) the main proponent of Hawaiian annexation. (By contrast Will Pattons Sanford B. Dole of pineapple fame is depicted as an eccentric supporter of the royalist cause.) The direction just kills the movie though. Forby a longtime producer making his behind-the-camera debut has no idea how to choreograph a compelling scene so he falls back on pretty cinematography and relentless fake-classical music on the soundtrack. The dialogue is in the key of Historical Inevitability -- characters declaim rather than speak -- and the general vibe a greeting-card version of ""Masterpiece Theatre. All ""Princess Kaiulani has going for it is its star.Which counts. Kilcher is a stunning beauty but not in any conventional way. She has a big long face that is settling into dramatic planes as she gets older; at times shes as impassive and as striking as an Easter Island statue. Elsewhere the characters emotions stream through the actresss eyes and in one remarkable scene Kaiulanis expression shuts down into a cruel mask as she finally understands the political game shell have to play. Kilcher offers a performance in search of a movie.Maybe she was born decades too late. This is a face made for silent cinema one to stand alongside Falconetti and Louise Brooks -- unusual dramatic extreme. An insipid little historical epic like ""Princess Kaiulani can only frame it. An adventurous filmmaker might use it and Kilcher to go someplace unexpected. Any takers?Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation.

Comments Princess Kaiulani Video Rated PG  130 minutes  2010 Qorianka Kilcher best known as Pocahontas in Terrence Malicks The New World stars as the title Hawaiian princess who left Waikiki as a teenager to be educated in the UK (her father was Scottish) and returned home just as her native land was becoming a U.S. republic. This historical drama is lovely to look at with elegant Victorian fashions and verdant tropical scenery but its story plays like a Hawaiian heritage lesson filtered through the melodramatic artifice of an old Hollywood costume drama. British writer-director Marc Forby drives the story down two parallel tracks while Kaiulani is enjoying a drippy romance with a nice English boy (Shaun Evans) a pair of American interlopers (Barry Pepper and Will Patton) subvert the Hawaiian monarchy. The movie keeps preparing us for the princesss date with political destiny but it never really arrives--Kaiulani never took the throne and died at age 23. By J.R.

Qorianka Kilcher portrayed Pocahontas in Malicks masterful 2005 historical epic ""The New World."" Her follow-up is the disappointing ""Princess Kaiulani"" directed by first-timer Marc Forby. Kilcher has the title role as a real-life Hawaiian royal in the 1880s who was exiled at age 13 when a coup overthrew the monarchy. The landscapes are exotic and Kilcher is erotic but the film plays like a generic made-for-TV biopic. Better luck next time Ms. Kilcher.

"Review Princess Kaiulani - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-ReviewReview Princess KaiulaniMay 13 2010 The true story of how Hawaii lost its sovereignty and became annexed to the United States may have been an interesting one but it makes for starchy entertainment in the historical drama ""Princess Kaiulani."" Written and directed by Mark Forby and told through the eyes of its title character a half-Hawaiian half-Scottish princess (bloodlessly played by ""The New Worlds"" Qorianka Kilcher) who in the late 1800s defended her homeland against American injustice the film is too reverently drawn and self-consciously played to muster any real momentum. The narrative picks up as ill-defined teen Princess Kaiulani (Is she shy? Headstrong? Snooty?) is sent to Victorian England after a rebel party linked to the American government overthrows the Hawaiian monarchy. Kaiulani moves in with her fathers wealthy trader friend and his family is humbled and enlightened and falls for the traders self-possessed son (Shaun Evans). But love doesnt conquer all and a few years later a matured Kaiulani returns to America to rally then- President Grover Cleveland on behalf of native Hawaiians before travelling back to Honolulu for good. Barry Pepper and Will Patton fine actors both are also on hand as American agents of change with differing plans for colonizing Hawaii but they can do little to ignite this sluggish tribute. a Gary Goldstein ""Princess Kaiulani.""

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet A major problem with trying to make a romantic drama out of the history of Hawaiis Princess Kaiulani is that she died young with relatively little chance for romance or drama. And while Princess Kaiulani makes do with what story it has the film feels stretched and straining full of sleepy scenes and pregnant pauses. Its as though first-time writer-director Marc Forby is hoping that if he waits long enough spontaneous action or bodice-ripping passion might suddenly break out to cut through the staid tone. The New Worlds Qorianka Kilcher stars as Victoria Kaiulani Cleghorn naive teenage heir to the Hawaiian throne. In 1887 American opportunists--represented by chillingly distant dramatically mustachioed Barry Pepper--overthrow the monarchy and disenfranchise most of the countrys citizens. Kaiulani is forcibly relocated to England for safekeeping education and prissy condescension from people who type her as a Polynesian barbarian. But after enduring a few scenes of hatefulness from her fellow students she acclimates and falls in love with her caretakers son (Shaun Evans). Further developments back home are hidden from her for much of the film which highlights one of Princess Kaiulanis biggest issues--the protagonists youth gender lack of information and constricted choices prevent her from driving the action. A better film might have focused on exploring her personality and how these limitations affect it but Forbys script and direction (and Kilchers reserved often mute portrayal) leave her as a charming blank. She gradually develops some spirit and a little agency but hardly enough to carry the film. Princess Kaiulani seems equally inspired by The New Worlds sun-dappled scenes of chaste passion and popular monarch-in-transition films like The Last Emperor and Elizabeth but it lacks Emperors pageantry and Elizabeths fire and force. Princess Kaiulanis greatest ""victories"" come through primly careful speeches that inspire a few key people but ultimately accomplish little as American annexation becomes inevitable. Scenes string together haphazardly to make her story more fable-like--as when a bullying schoolmate abruptly returns to receive some telling kindness from the princess then disappears again--but careful composition and a sweet romance cant hide the storys lack of depth or purpose. Even the presumed emotional fury of a country taken by force is muddled romanticized or tamed into civil costume-drama banality Theres a strict limit to how much drama there can be in a film when the writer-director has characters express ultimate fury via a polite leave-taking.

Young) has realized that the nonconformist ideals of his elders -- like his parents (odd-duck pairing Andie MacDowell and Mark Boone Junior) and a seductive hypnotist guru (Rutger Hauer) -- have produced a litter of burnt-out oversexed downright oppressed kids without the ability to see their looming self-destruction. Loosely based on writer-director Adam Shermans similar cult upbringing and disillusionment the film builds on a fascinating cautionary tale but doesnt develop its characters past whatever movie-of-the-week crisis each suffers from. We get that everyones folks are too busy getting high or laid but without a deepening of those parent-child dynamics were left with a tacky Lord of the Flies scenario seemingly filmed by Larry Clark like a trippy 60s surf movie. Victor doesnt have the scratch to move away and hes also distracted by his constantly naked childhood love Becky (Hanna Hall the youngest sis from The Virgin Suicides) who has returned to care for her ailing dad and fuck every boy just to feel anything. (Aaron Hillis) (Sunset 5) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - JUST WRIGHT Another movie not as awful as this one might one day find better use for the easygoing vibe between Queen Latifah and Common the stars of Just Wright a romantic comedy (for the ladies) with basketball and cameoing NBA players in it (for the fellas). That absolutely no chemistry exists between them as love interests is the first of the many flaws in a film that also demands we believe the New Jersey Nets could become Eastern Conference champions. Earthy virtuous physical therapist and hoops fanatic Leslie Wright (Latifah) shares her house with her hyperfemme gold-digging childhood friend Morgan (Paula Patton). The p.t. meets Net Scott McNight (Common) and develops a crush -- but Rules-playing Morgan gets the All-Stars marriage proposal. A midpoint ligament injury allows thick girls to triumph over thin ones Leslie and Scott share cocoa bread a quick kiss and eventually a bed. Writer Michael Elliot distinguishes himself by putting words into Latifahs mouth that she probably hasnt uttered since Living Single went off the air ""Im a Jersey girl. I gotta represent"" Though no pheromones could ever be secreted in a love triangle this square watching Leslie and Scotts relationship shift from platonic to romantic is as weird and wrong as watching siblings kiss each other on the mouth. (Melissa Anderson) (Citywide)LETTERS TO JULIET Blonde pillow-topped and spineless Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) has a secure fact-checking job and is engaged to Victor (Gael Garcia Bernal) a hunky restaurateur of indeterminate exotic origin who dangles hot fresh fettuccine into her mouth in a totally nonthreatening not-at-all-91/2 Weeks-ish way. But Sophies not satisfied She really wants to write an ambition that sets the eyes of both boyfriend and boss aglaze. When Victor seems more interested in spending their Italian vacation hunting truffles than digging her Sophie drifts off and ends up in Verona at the mythic home of Shakespeares Juliet where a cadre of volunteer secretaries answers letters left behind by lovelorns. Soon Sophies tagging along as English widow Claire (Vanessa Redgrave) visits a roundelay of Italian geezers to find the farmhand she loved and left back in the 50s. Enter Claires no-fun lawyer grandson Charlie (Christopher Egan) whose interest in Sophies writing makes up for his post-schoolboy prissiness. Juliets core messages -- date boys who are cool with you having a career and dont settle; NYC wine snobs are selfish but guys who grow grapes and/or do pro bono legal work will love you forever -- are inoffensive but theyre hardly the stuff of swooning fantasia. And fantasy Juliet clearly intends to be -- too many plane tickets are booked last-minute without mention of the cost of the trip. Gary Winicks flat direction does the material no favors If Egan and Seyfried have any chemistry its framed out of their awkwardly staged climactic kisses. (Karina Longworth) (Citywide)A NIGHTMARE IN LAS CRUCES On February 10 1990 in Los Cruces New Mexico two armed men robbed a bowling alley and then put bullets in the heads of the seven people theyd stumbled upon in the building including two sisters aged 6 and 2. For 20 years the culprits have been at large and director Charlie Minn made this documentary in part to keep the story alive while cataloguing the lives lost ruined or deeply crippled by the massacre. From the start however as the viewer listens to the entire 911 call made after the gunmen fled and as graphic crime-scene photos fill the screen a sense of dread sets in that whats about to unfold is exploitation tricked up in moral outrage. As the film unfolds it proves to be just that. To Minns credit he sheds light on a shady businessmans shady family one of whom may have been the true target of the bloody rampage (police officials interviewed agree that the half-ass robbery was a front for the attack) and the teary testimonials by grieving widows and mothers are genuinely wrenching. But Minn a mediocre interviewer tips his hand by not only repeatedly showing bloody crime scene photos and videos but in staging reunions of survivors who havent seen each other in more than a decade so his camera can capture tears. He also includes self-aggrandizing news footage of himself being interviewed about making the film. The cause? Noble. The crusader? Not so much. (Ernest Hardy) (Beverly Center) Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat. Sep. 10 1200pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On the CW Tickets Sat. Sep. 10 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On CBS Tickets Mon. Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm PRINCESS KAIULANI Qorianka Kilchers first role since her stunning breakout as Pocahontas in Terrence Malicks The New World finds her playing to type as the last princess of Hawaii struggling against the American takeover of a then-sovereign republic. Its her second indigenous-versus-white people role in a row which suggests troubling things about her career prospects. Marc Forbys directorial debut doesnt try to avoid comparisons with Malick; with rapturous shots of hands passing through pristine fields it actively courts them. But Forby is much schlockier employing pan pipes to signify that were now in England when the princess travels there to wait out political turmoil; when she returns to a devastated republic weepy violins kick in and the end of an era seems (and is) inevitable as Hawaii becomes just another American colony. To be fair Princess Kaiulani (previous title unbelievably Barbarian Princess) is livelier than the usual period piece it looks decent and moves fast. But that speed means that a whole lot of history gets way too compressed (the takeover of Hawaii is basically reduced to Kilchers face versus evil black-hatted Barry Peppers mustache a spectacular follicle creation that upstages his entire performance). And this may be the only film in history to have someone learn about egalitarianism at a British boarding school (). Hawaiis dismal onscreen track record continues; bring back James Michener. (Vadim Rizov) (Monica Music Hall Playhouse)THE THORN IN THE HEART As a music-video director Michel Gondry excelled at making childlike dream worlds real; as a fiction filmmaker (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Science of Sleep) hes best when giving hypercinematic form to the raw inner lives of modern man-children. Its a shock then that The Thorn in the Heart Gondrys documentary about his own family is so unimaginative and inaccessible. Sweeping through several decades and French countryside towns to focus on Gondrys aunt former schoolteacher Suzette Thorn is full of stylistic entry points for the Gondry faithful. His signature shabby-chic stop-motion animation sets scenes while grainy oversaturated home movies are woven into new material (some featuring the director as a supporting player) processed to match. The aesthetics are lovely but lazily conceived; the best scene is a chroma-key exercise scored to a Charlotte Gainsbourg tune its function in the film inexplicable. Gondrys tricks dont do much to open what is essentially a closed loop. The trouble starts in the first scene Suzette attempts to tell a story having something to do with her late husband and what was apparently a hilarious misunderstanding involving sauerkraut but shes laughing so hard that she can barely get the words out. Her family laughs too -- perhaps theyre familiar enough with this story that theyre getting something were not or perhaps theyre just being polite. Either way its a family bond that Gondry doesnt let us break through. Watching Thorn is like being helplessly locked out of an inside joke. (Karina Longworth) (Sunset 5)GO  TRASH HUMPERS Harmony Korine aging enfant terrible and self-proclaimed ""most American"" of American indies finds his level and brings it home to Nashville with the gloriously desultory slap in the face of public taste Trash Humpers. Korine has proposed the film as a VHS tape found in a ditch. Most simply described this quasi-underground midnight-friendly faux-primitive ""artifact"" documents a trio of fake geriatric bohos outfitted in thrift-store finery with faces frozen by transparent wrinkle masks engaging in all manner of antisocial behavior -- smashing TV sets torturing dolls pouring dish soap on a stack of pancakes and most frequently lasciviously grinding their groins against back-alley garbage bins. A spectacle to be watched in a wino stupor Trash Humpers is funny from the get-go; the joke expires after 20 minutes around the time that three hookers having already been rhythmically spanked serenade the three devils with a toneless version of ""Silent Night."" The movie however continues for another hour. Sign of the times Trash Humpers is all about free expression but Korines transgressions seem a lot less expansive and liberating than John Waters or Jack Smiths did back during the invention of identity politics. Rather than self-actualizing libidinal ecstasy Trash Humpers projects a cranky resignation to the world as it is. Its ultimately less a celebration of impulse behavior than a celebration of the parodic impulse to record. (J. Hoberman) (Nuart) WHY AM I DOING THIS? Scenes drag a tad too long and subplots go nowhere but buried beneath the fat is a funny (if derivative) film about modern Asian identities (including hip-hop thugs) as they play out on both the big screen and the everyday stage. Writer-director Tom Huang plays 30-year-old Tony Chang a struggling actor who works childrens parties until his big break comes who bums money from his very funny family to make ends meet. At one party he falls for a schoolteacher (moonlighting as a costumed bear) and proceeds to juggle his flailing career with a fledgling romance. The latter opens a can of worms about Asians dating within and without the race. Meanwhile his best friend Lester (played by the very talented Anthony Montgomery) is on a parallel course -- trying to break into the world of stand-up as a quirky nonstereotypical black dude while grappling with the complexities of being in an interracial relationship. Had Huang jettisoned the subplots about Tonys user actress friend and Lesters creepily dependent mother his low-budget film would have been more effective and possibly had space to develop the Asian riffs on Hollywood Shuffle which make up the opening scenes.
