Starring Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt. Directed by Robert Zemeckis. (PG-13. 140 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Cast Away"" is a laugh-out-loud delight easily the funniest picture since ""South Park."" It will bring joy to audiences though not in the way it was intended -- as an uplifting tale of the human spirit. Instead it will bring joy in a way certainly not intended as one of the most gloriously and unwittingly silly films ever devised by a major American filmmaker. Still joy is joy so even if Tom Hanks and director Robert Zemeckis (""Forrest Gump"") had no idea they were making a comedy we shouldnt hold that against them. Bad movies are like a box of chocolates You never know what youre going to get. This time we get Tom Hanks as a FedEx exec who becomes an inadvertent slapstick comedian after he washes up on a desert island. Hanks had the original idea for the film which from an actors point of view had to be irresistible. What better way to go for a third Oscar than to spend most of a movie as the only human being onscreen? (He already has been nominated for a Golden Globe.) And what better way to prove ones seriousness than by losing over 50 pounds and acquiring lots of facial hair? Ninety minutes in Hanks is hairier than a community-theater John the Baptist. Zemeckis is a capable director so despite the misguided concept the movie is anything but inept. In fact the 30 minutes that lead up to Hanks island ordeal are well done. First of all theres the plane crash and what a crash it is. Chuck (Hanks) is traveling on a cargo jet. The plane hits some bumpy air. He gets up looks around goes into the bathroom. And a second later he is hanging sideways out of the bathroom holding on by his fingernails. Nervous fliers will revisit the plane crash sequence in their nightmares. Its harrowing. The plane hits the ocean and breaks up. From there our hero struggles to get to the ocean surface and once there he has to contend with fuel fires while trying to avoid getting sucked into the engine. In retrospect Hanks getting sucked into the engine might have made for a nifty finish. Instead he washes up on the island and this is where the fun starts. For the island scenes Zemeckis employs a novel strategy in his use of sound. He lets the island speak for itself. Theres no music track just the island noises and the ebb and flow of the ocean. Zemeckis realistic strategy works at first and then it backfires creating the feel of one of those ""The Making of . . ."" shorts. Soon it becomes impossible to forget that were watching a millionaire actor stumbling around pretending to be alone while within three feet of a camera crew a dressing room and a hot lunch. Remember how in the old Laurel and Hardy movies Laurel would always accidentally do something to cause Hardy physical injury -- and Hardy would always let out a painful wail? In every one of those movies it would eventually get to the point where audiences actually looked forward to the ridiculous sound of Hardy screaming. Well something like that happens with Hanks in ""Cast Away."" Our hero cuts his thigh on a rock ""Ahhhhh"" He tries to build a fire and slices the skin off his hands ""Ahhhhh"" Or he tries to pull an infected tooth with an ice skate ""Ahhhhh"" he screams then faints. I havent laughed so hard in months. ""Cast Away"" turns out to be a picture in which Hanks spends 45 minutes talking to a volleyball. Its a spirited relationship. You havent lived until youve seen Hanks covered in hair apologizing to a volleyball. Or weeping because his volleyball-friend is missing. Such scenes are meant to highlight Chucks desperation. Instead they show the desperate lengths to which an actor will go in pursuit of another Oscar nomination. Helen Hunt plays Kelly the woman Chuck loves and hopes to see again. Hunt is down to earth lovely and affecting and her scenes with Hanks are the best in the picture. But the last part of the movie is so suffused in schmaltz and half-baked sad-sack philosophy that it leaves Hunt with nothing to do but stand in admiration of our heros quiet courage and nobility. Were supposed to feel the same way about him. Forget it.

(20th Century Fox) Im happy to inform you that the fat bearded guy spearing fish in ""Cast Away"" is not Richard Hatch. Its Tom Hanks playing a Federal Express inspector marooned on a remote island. Hes not trying to win a million bucks or vote people off the island. Hes just building fires dreaming of returning to mainland USA and having extended conversations with a volleyball. Thats right. As the sole survivor of a plane crash in the Pacific Chuck Noland (Hanks) is pretty much stuck for company. Breaking open a washed-up FedEx package he pulls out the ball and finds himself a pneumatic buddy. He paints a face on the ball (with a little blood) places it on a rock and calls it Wilson. (Speaking of product placement you never met a nicer group of folks than the folks who work for FedEx in this movie. Chuck even refers to the company slogan of ""absolutely positively overnight."") Chucks round little pal presides benevolently over him as he learns to make fire and builds that inevitable raft outta there. Wilson also gives Chuck - and the movie audience - a welcome alternative to the crashing silence of this remote place. And lets be honest Hanks isnt going to secure an Oscar nomination by just grunting and spitting out fishbones. With a giveaway title like ""Cast Away"" we know where this movie is heading. Which makes the prelude (when Hanks is at his tubbiest) enjoyably fraught with destiny. When we meet him hes en route to a Russian field office to urge employees to avoid the ""sin of losing track of time."" Its clear hes an automaton. Even his engagement to Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt) seems like a mere coefficient of his work/play schedule. He needs a life lesson - including romantic deprivation from Kelly. (And besides Helen Hunt needs time to be in all those other movies she appears in this year.) When Chuck promises his fiancee hell be back in time for New Years Eve its time for mental head shaking. No Auld Lang Syne for you this year buddy. Or the next or the . . . Well how long does this involuntary sojourn take? There are only so many surprises to this movie; it would be a sin to tell you. Director Robert Zemeckis and screenwriter William Broyles Jr. do a great job of keeping the cut-and-dried formula from well getting too cut and dried. Instead of rushing through that plane crash for instance they show us memorable detail. When Chuck floats alone in the Pacific he has to engage an overturned raft then avoid a still-revving turbo jet thats chewing up the flotsam and jetsam like a metal shark. Theres a wonderful moment at sea much later when Chuck encounters a whale as it watches him with one intense eye. And before Chuck starts that relationship with Wilson Zemeckis makes a regular symphony out of the wild sounds of surf and wind. But most of the credit for keeping our attention goes to the island boy. If theres anyone who can make this ordeal - and when youre plumb out of characters it can be an ordeal - tolerable and even entertaining its Hanks. Despite the seriousness of the situation (the possibility of dying alone and stranded) he fills his scenes with a certain cheery determination. Anyone who can spike poignancy from a volleyball is more than doing his job. And Hankss natural affinity for comedy cant help but poke through. When hes aware for the first time that hes probably alone on this island he hears mysterious crashes. One after the other. Eventually he cant stand it any longer. ""What is that?"" he yells. And despite the tension of the scene its a very funny moment - a sort of amusing strangled squawk from a yuppie whos coming to terms with losing control. And that pulls us even deeper into the story. ""Cast Away"" (PG-13 148 minutes) - Contains an emotionally traumatic plane crash urination defecation and bloody injuries.

"Cast Away | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; cast-away ) Cast Away (United States 2000) A movie review by James Berardinelli Im sure there will be wags who will glibly compare Cast Away to the likes of ""Gilligans Island"" and ""Survivor"" but in tone approach and overall accomplishment this atypical Robinson Crusoe tale bears a strong resemblance to one of director Robert Zemeckis earlier efforts Contact. No Cast Away isnt about space or messages from another planet but at its core neither was Contact. Both films ask the same crucial existential question one that Shakespeare pondered for years taking all things into account what does it mean to be human? How do we cope with loss hopelessness and isolation and still find the courage to face the next day? The love and dream of a dead father sustained Jodie Fosters character in Contact. For Tom Hanks Chuck Noland in Cast Away it is the promise offered by the smile of his equally absent - and equally beloved - wife-to-be. The last time Zemeckis and Hanks teamed up a legend was born - the idiot savant Forrest Gump. A brilliantly conceived trip through the latter half of the 20th century Forrest Gump was part folksy feel-good drama and part well-concealed satire. The 1994 blockbuster offers much more than its detractors and even some of its supports acknowledge. Those expecting Zemeckis and Hanks to re-examine the same territory in Cast Away will be surprised - aside from the films Oscar potential theres little synergy. Cast Away will not be the crowd-pleaser that Forrest Gump was but its a deeper more rewarding experience. And just when you think its over it defies expectations and metamorphoses into something different and more compelling. The year is 1995. Chuck Noland is an overworked Federal Express exec who zips from country to country troubleshooting problems and streamlining operations. His mantra is to do anything necessary to get a package to its destination on time. In his younger days he was known for having stolen a kids bicycle to make a delivery after his truck broke down. Fresh from a trip to Russia Chuck is enjoying Christmas dinner with his girlfriend Kelly (Helen Hunt) and his family when a call comes in hes needed in Malaysia. A short time later hes airborne flying through stormy skies over the South Pacific. Suddenly the plane is off course theres an explosion and Chuck finds himself underwater in the belly of a crashed plane. An inflatable life raft carries him to the surface and bears him to a deserted tropical island where he learns that survival without the trappings of civilization is far more difficult than its made out to be in books on television and in the movies. There may not be any humans on the island but something is making noise in the jungle at night. And how is he to obtain food and fresh water? Without proper tools simple tasks like opening a coconut or making a fire become herculean efforts. Cast Away is divided into three clearly-defined acts the setup the main story and the aftermath. Although the movies centerpiece is the 75-minute portion detailing Chucks experiences while marooned its the third act which offers no easy solutions for difficult situations that elevates the film from the level of a stirring innovative adventure to an fully satisfying drama. This is the film Red Planet could have been if it had possessed the guts to challenge viewers rather than saddle them with a worn-out regurgitated plot. The plane crash which occurs during the first half-hour is handled differently from almost any aerial disaster I have seen in a motion picture. Zemeckis employs digital effects but not to show the crash (he uses them primarily afterwards to generate Perfect Storm-style waves). We see events unfold from inside the plane amidst the wind and darkness and it results in an eerie and genuinely unsettling situation. Then once Chuck is in the water the sense of danger is palpable - especially during one unforgettable moment when the planes spinning propeller is bearing down upon his small life raft. The scenes on the island are presented with uncommon intelligence (unlike similar events chronicled in the lame Six Days Seven Nights which used similar circumstances). We follow Chuck on his step-by-step journey of survival where even the smallest things like getting a drink of coconut milk or using MacGyver-like ingenuity to devise a tool become significant accomplishments. Zemeckis approach to this segment of the film is flawless. He never cuts away from Chuck - there are no ""back in Memphis"" scenes that would have broken the mood nor is there any incidental music. For more than an hour the only sounds heard are the islands natural noises (and a little dialogue as Chuck starts talking to a volley ball that becomes his lone ""companion""). Also the script doesnt cook up any hard-to-swallow melodramatic situations or artificial conflicts. In fact those expecting a routine adventure film may be disappointed. Cast Away is always interesting but not necessarily in a traditional manner. By the time the 30-minute epilogue arrives we are already deeply attached to Chucks character - a fact that makes the final dilemma harder to cope with. Once again Zemeckis and screenwriter William Broyles Jr avoid the melodramatic manipulative clichA(c)s that could have reduced Cast Away to a lesser film. They remain true to the characters and situations until the end which involves literal and figurative crossroads. There is a catharsis of sorts but it will not be definitive enough to satisfy all viewers. For the level of his work in Cast Away it wouldnt surprise me if Hanks earned another Oscar nomination. The movies success rests with him since he is on screen by himself for more than half of the running time. Its one thing for an actor to triumph by playing off others; its another thing altogether for him to excel with no one else around and virtually no dialogue to speak. In addition the physical changes that Hanks had to go through to play the part are dramatic - he was forced to gain and lose weight quickly and in extraordinary amounts (so much so that a ""weight loss trainer"" is credited at the end). An actor willing to go through the rigors Hanks endured is certainly worthy of some kind of notice especially when he turns in a top-notch performance. The only other significant player is Helen Hunt who has become ubiquitous in motion pictures now that ""Mad About You"" is behind her. This is her fourth film in four months (the other three Dr. T and the Women Pay It Forward and What Women Want). This time shes more of a supporting player but despite limited screen time she manages to develop Kelly into a flesh-and-blood individual which is crucial to the movies emotional underpinning. Of all Hunts recent outings this is easily her strongest work. For as long as he works in Hollywood Robert Zemeckis will be associated with Forrest Gump. As good a film as that was it does not represent his finest work. In many ways both Contact and Cast Away are stronger and more compelling features. During a year that has not been known for strong theater-going experiences Cast Away stands near the top of the heap. It has all the hallmarks of a great motion picture well-developed characters solid drama non-traditional adventure and an intelligent script. At nearly two and one-half hours its the perfect length - not too long and not too short. Whether or not Cast Away earns any Oscar nominations its among my picks as one of the best films of the year.

Director Robert Zemeckis and star Tom Hanks take tremendous risks -- both dramatic and commercial -- and for the most part succeed in ""Cast Away."" In this bold and unique story about a single character stranded on an island a top-notch Hanks holds the picture on his shoulders with a bravura perf. Meticulous sumptuous production design and striking visuals compensate for the lack of dramatic momentum in a film that arguably stretches narrative form to its limits. Strong critical support should help position this adventure saga as an ""event movie"" both in the U.S. (where Fox is distribbing) and overseas (where DreamWorks will release it). The PG-13 rating is a major plus; young viewers will relate to the story as a contempo Robinson Crusoe while the philosophical elements are likely to appeal to more mature auds. ""Cast Away"" bears thematic resemblance to ""Forrest Gump"" the earlier Zemeckis-Hanks teaming in its focus on the personal journey of an Everyman. But the 1994 Oscar winner spanned decades and numerous locales with its hero the only constant; however the bulk of the new pic is confined to one setting and a much tighter time frame depicting in detail the moral odyssey of one man. Hanks who serves as a producer plays an ambitious FedEx system engineer whose life run with the precision of a Swiss watch is shattered when his plane crashes leaving him alone on a remote island. The narrative is divided into four asymmetrical parts. Set in 1995 the first segment establishes Chucks manic personal and professional lives. His fast-paced career takes him often on a moments notice to far-flung cities such as Moscow away from his loving g.f. Kelly (a splendidly understated Helen Hunt). Returning home on a FedEx plane Chuck cant wait to spend Christmas Eve with Kelly. But a mechanical problem on the plane causes a terrifying crash filmed with unprecedented gritty realism. In the second segment Chuck is forced to deal with the most basic biological needs. Film plays up well the irony of a career-driven man used to solving problems faced with the most urgent problem of all sheer survival. Cut to four years later. Tale now finds Chuck trim and muscular sporting long blond hair and a bushy beard and stripped to a Tarzan-like outfit. Having mastered the four basic needs -- food water shelter and fire -- he begins to deal with his need for companionship. While his memories of Kelly are essential to Chucks survival he also establishes an unusual relationship with ""Wilson"" a volleyball washed ashore inside a FedEx package from the doomed flight. Playing a crucial role Wilson rescues Chuck from solitude as well as depression. This fellowship also allows Chuck to speak -- after an hours worth of mostly silence. Driven forward by the strength and struggles of its hero ""Cast Away"" takes admirable risks while avoiding pitfalls. Story stays close to the ground literally maintaining a coherent p.o.v. with Chuck the center of attention; there are no cuts to societys or Kellys reaction to Chucks disaster. Fate gives Chuck a chance to fight his way back to civilization in a daring escape only to face an unexpected emotional challenge that in many ways is more demanding than the physical ones he survived. Though theres closure the last segment deviates refreshingly from a conventional Hollywood ending. Building a script based on journals of shipwreck victims William Broyles Jr. creates a skillful work in which events and emotions are brought to life with sparse dialogue and little music; the first melodic sound is heard 90 minutes into the story. Pic is replete with ironies and subtle humor. As a FedEx exec Chuck is dedicated to connecting people all over the world but the yarn throws him into a situation in which he is disconnected from everything. Moreover the islands pristine beauty and serenity stand in contrast to Chucks civilized life. The irony is that for most people the Fiji islands rep tropical paradise whereas for Chuck they become a prison. And Zemeckis gives the film heart depicting Chucks efforts to get water make a knife out of stone and (in one of the films most humorous scenes) crack a coconut. The film revolves around a key question Once you have learned to survive physically how do you survive emotionally and spiritually? While Chuck opens the FedEx packages that have washed ashore he decides not to open one thats adorned with angel wings which becomes a symbol of hope -- one he holds onto even after his return. More problematic is the suggestion that if Chuck hadnt lost everything he would never have come to understand whats truly important. Its here that the film gets excessively academic and metaphysical. Ultimately ""Cast Away"" is about realizing the true meaning of belonging of finding home casting away the clutter that complicates life in an effort to rediscover what matters. This issue comes into focus in the last reel. The helmer shows again his mastery of mise-en-scene Chucks return to civilization is so brilliantly staged that it almost makes up for the unexciting spots at the center. Its hard to imagine this film without the captivating perf of Hanks who reaches another height in an already impressive career. Filmed in sequential order ""Cast Away"" may be the only pic shot in two parts over 16 months with a one-year hiatus to allow for Hanks physical transformation. Don Burgess unglamorous lensing contributes to the sagas modulated look with the Russian sequences (a glimpse of Red Square) shot with a restlessly mobile camera to convey Chucks frantic pace. In contrast the island and its rugged distinctive geography is shot in a static manner to depict Chucks quiet desperation.
