"Review Scott Pilgrim hits the sweet spot - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon LinkedIn Review Scott Pilgrim hits the sweet spot By Tom Charity Special to CNN Scott Pilgrim is epicSTORY HIGHLIGHTSReviewer says ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" is way funEnglish director Edgar Wright cheekily drops in a few gagsMovie is ""full of fresh sharp touches and nonchalantly brash performances"" RELATED TOPICS Scott Pilgrim vs. The World Michael Cera Movies Celebrity News Entertainment (CNN) -- The hipsters event movie ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" is an anti-blockbuster an amped youth comedy thats so far out of the mainstream its not only filmed in Toronto its set there too. These days even hipster movies come out of comic books. And they can stretch to include wiz-bang digital effects just so long as theyre delivered with an ironic wink or a ""Batman""-esque ""Kappow"" The big joke in Bryan Lee OMalleys slacker odyssey - and its a good one - is that when his under-employed underground hero (the cutely anxious Michael Cera) takes up with a cool American girl Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) he must fight it out with her seven exes in videogame-style battles. Are these dreams hallucinations or fantasies? Could Scott be the hero of his own computer game without even knowing it? OMalley doesnt say and doesnt care. The fights are as real as anything else in Scotts rather blurry life -- and more interesting than most of it. Take away the ghosts of boyfriends past and the only thing you have going on in this ""epic of epic epicness"" is Scotts fledgling music career -- he plays bass in indie-wannabes Sex Bob-Omb --and his mildly guilty conscience for momentarily two-timing his previous sort-of girlfriend 17-year-old Knives Chau (Ellen Wong). Hes at that age (22) when real life hasnt taken hold yet. When you can get by sharing a one-room double-mattress apartment with your gay pal because it fits your non-existent income and fail to comprehend that your new girlfriend might be unimpressed with the arrangement. OMalley has lucked into his ideal interpreter in the English director Edgar Wright. Wrights films were the spoofs ""Hot Fuzz"" and ""Shaun of the Dead"" and he inspired a cult following of his own for the innovative pop savvy sit-com ""Spaced."" Many of the stylistic tics from ""Spaced"" reappear in ""Scott Pilgrim"" but theyre so much of a piece with OMalleys quirky line in comic book cool that its hard to say what came from where. Pop-up info bites quickfire cutaways and obsessive fanboy references to games and TV are the order of the day. Wright cheekily drops in the theme music from ""Seinfeld"" and the Nintendo game ""Legend of Zelda"" and if you dont get both these gags then youre probably not going to enjoy this movie. All of Wrights comedy is about the gap between the ordinary couch-potato lives most of us lead and the exciting big screen version playing out in heroes heads. Hes a perfect fit for this movie. iReport Share your ""Scott Pilgrim"" reviews on video Full of fresh sharp touches and nonchalantly brash performances (from Kieran Culkin Jason Schwartzman and Anna Kendrick among others) ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" consistently hits the sweet spot even if youre ready for Scott to take it up to the next level some way before the climax. A bit more face time with Ramona wouldnt go amiss either. But those are minor gripes. I promise you its way more fun than the grown ups are having in the screen next door.

BOTTOM LINE Fresh funny and unique with enough lightning-fast jokes to make up for the lulls. LENGTH 148 Based on the cult comic-book series by Bryan Lee OMalley ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" is speaking directly to a generation raised on video games cell phones rock music television comic books and yes even movies. In fact it runs the risk of alienating everyone else - but too bad for them. Its fresh funny inventive and unique. Michael Cera plays Scott Pilgrim geeky bassist for the Toronto rock band Sex Bob-Omb (say it). His life is upended by an alluringly jaded alt-babe Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Against all odds she agrees to date him but first Scott must destroy her seven ex-lovers superheroes with a range of bizarre powers. advertisement | advertise on newsday What genre is this? A new one possibly. Were witnessing a young mans emotions being translated awkwardly but endearingly into metaphors that make sense to him. Scott is literally competing with Ramonas sexual history which means conquering his fears with martial arts and giant swords. Cera punches and kicks against puppy-dog type but hes only one part of a terrific young cast that includes a show-stealing Kieran Culkin. The film can wear on you but director and co-writer Edgar Wright packs in brilliant sight gags and clever edits to make up for the lulls. At times ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" feels like ""Breathless"" or ""Pulp Fiction"" a movie that speaks its own modern youthful language. For both better and worse it feels no need to explain.

Pretty great flash though. Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) tries to romance Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) in the amazing story of one romantic slackers quest to power up with love the action-comedy ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"".Photo Credit Kerry HayesCopyright (c) 2010 Universal Studios. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald8/11/2010 Editor rating 2.5 For the first 30 minutes or so I was certain Scott Pilgrim vs. the World had nabbed a spot on my list of the best films of the year. By the last 30 minutes I couldnt wait for it to end. In adapting Bryan OMalleys six-volume graphic novel director Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead Hot Fuzz) has thrown the kitchen sink the refrigerator the dishwasher and the plumbing into the mix. The result is initially exhilarating ultimately exhausting. Part of the problem is built into the central premise. The geeky eponymous hero (Michael Cera) is a 22-year-old guitarist dating Knives Chau (Ellen Wong) a high schooler who is only allowed outside while the sun is up. Scott and Knives have never so much as kissed -- they have however held hands -- so he doesnt feel much remorse when he lays eyes on the (literal) girl of his dreams and she agrees to go out on a date. Her name is Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). She has a wry sense of humor. She changes her hair color every other week and she comes with a big catch Her seven evil exes intent on controlling her romantic future pop up one after the other to challenge Scott to a fight to the death. Scotts first throwdown against a boy (Satya Bhabha) Ramona dated briefly in the seventh grade is the films best a Street Fighter-style punch out incorporating flying dropkicks wire-fu demonic harpies and a Bollywood number. The second against a tough-guy movie star (Chris Evans) and his army of body doubles is also amusing. The third in which Scott squares off against a hard-line vegan (a surprisingly funny Brandon Routh) whose eating habits give him godlike powers is capped by a great punch line. But by the time the fourth evil ex shows up Scott Pilgrim vs. the World starts to grow tiresome its repetition an enemy even Scott cannot vanquish. Wright who also wrote the script with Michael Bacall packs the movie with great supporting characters to distract you from the rinse-and-repeat structure of the screenplay. Kieran Culkin scores some big laughs as Scotts gay roommate. Anna Kendrick nails the nagging sister bit and Alison Pill effectively channels vintage Molly Ringwald as the drummer of Scotts band who still hasnt gotten over being dumped when they dated in high school. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World captures the experience of reading a comic book better than any other movie Ive seen The screen often splits into diagonal or horizontal panels; blocks of texts float in the air and occasionally animation takes over. As OMalley in the books Wright also draws heavily on video games although the references extend back to the Pong/Atari 2600 generation so practically no one with a passing interest in the movie will feel left out (the soundtrack is full of recognizable beeps and boops from consoles and computers you register subconsciously). Theres no denying the creative invention of the film and its humor is consistent to the end. Wright can turn even the simple act of tying a shoelace into a funny gag. But the rapid-fire pace combined with the constraint of the locked-in premise eventually starts to feel a little oppressive and although Cera is terrific as the skinny gawky nobody who proves exceedingly difficult to kill he has practically no chemistry with Winstead. You never buy Scott and Ramona -- he and the too-young Knives make a more amusing couple -- and without emotional involvement Scott Pilgrim vs. the World becomes a fatal case of flash over substance.

Like Spaced Scott Pilgrim trades in the messy lives of twentysomething slackers and springs from the world of the comic book. The characters in Spaced often felt like they tripped off the pages of a graphic novel (and Simon Peggs Tim was a fledgling comic artist) while the original Scott Pilgrim was the hero of a six-volume Canadian comic-book series published between 2004 and this year.Scott Pilgrim also has a similar relationship to realism and fantasy as Spaced what we get are down-to-earth observations on everyday lives explained with wild flights of visual and narrative fancy with plenty of nods to films and TV shows loud music and daring edits.Whether you like or just admire Scott Pilgrim will probably rest with how you feel about Scott as played by Hollywoods favourite nerd Michael Cera. Scott is the 22-year-old jobless bass player in a garage band called Sex Bob-omb and is the kind of role that Cera regularly plays. But hes also likeable adorable at times and free of the super-cool jive-talking that mars films like Juno. Hes self-centred and emotionally childish but no more we think than most of us and we enjoy the company of his friends especially his vicious gay flatmate (Kieran Culkin). It means that when the frosty unreachable Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) enters his life and he gives his try-hard younger girlfriend Knives Chau (Ellen Wong) the brush-off were running along with him.Which is handy because most of the film invites us to take a trip in Scotts head a place heavily influenced by computer games.Ramona warns that hell have to defeat her seven evil exes before they can get together - a classic gaming challenge - but the way the film flows between dream and reality straight drama and crazy flourishes makes it clear that its mostly happening in Scotts mind. And so the seven battles come one by one complete with on-screen point scoring like an arcade game. Two fights stand out Scotts showdown with Lucas Lee (Chris Evans) a film star making a movie in Toronto and his dispersal of a vegan rock star (Brandon Routh). The later battles are a bit less engaging and its a relief when one of Scotts adversaries turns out to be two a pair of twins.Scott Pilgrim feels like Ghost World in its honouring of young people with spikey interesting personalities. There are hints of Woody Allen in its navel-gazing. And theres a dash of The Matrix in its sneaky affection for pyrotechnics. It could have been a noisy flashy mess but luckily its got heart which makes it feel fun and unique and more like a lo-fi endearing mess instead.

First time of watching it I almost left halfway through was wondering why so many critics had rated it so highly. But I persevered and at the end thought that it was okay fairly good at best. But then my girlfriend wanted to watch it so we did together. And I loved it Something about the cartoon-ish aspects the quick cuts the overall bizarrity of it just seemed so much better when I was expecting it than when I wasnt.

Disappointingly heartless. Michael Ceras shrill voice and intense diffidence dont help the film. There is some good stuff here though.

For me the film lacked a heart. The Scott character is played a little too casually and unemotionally - and the hookup with Ramona is just not believable - theres no chemistry at all.

amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> Scott Pilgrim vs. The World amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << Step Up 3D The Expendables >> Scott Pilgrim vs. The World Michael Cera has the face of a penguin and the legs of a ballerina. Its easy to dismiss him as an impossible action hero but look again--with a tuck of the chin and a glower settling across his brow hes a scrapper an immovable mule used to getting what he wants. That mutability serves him well in Scott Pilgrim a film itself so mutable that sometimes its scarcely a film at all. Edgar Wright has made a 112-minute entertainment contraption celluloid that shapeshifts its frames into video games comic books and sitcoms. Based on a graphic novel in turn inspired by 8-bit pixels this spazmodic flick about a would-be boyfriend who must fight--nay defeat--his crush Mary Elizabeth Winsteads seven evil exes isnt even patient enough for scenes. Instead Wright merges all action into one whiplash-fast time continuum. It could give a seizure to anyone in the Twitterverse unused to dividing their brain among twelve browser windows. But for the already addled--myself millions more and metastasizing--its a blast fun fresh and unbounded with an ensemble that delivers every joke and elbow jab. Under the chaos Wright and co-writer Michael Bacall have laced empathy for the too-human mess we make of relationships. Everyone has loved everyone has lost and everyone has been the villain to another hero (or heroine). Thats the game of life and were all playing.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 13 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Scott Pilgrim vs. the World Directed by Edgar Wright Written by Michael Bacall and Edgar Wright Starring Michael Cera and Mary Elizabeth Winstead For years now people have been complaining that movies are turning into video games and comic books. English director Edgar Wright ( Shaun of the Dead Hot Fuzz) takes the approach that movies have been far too reticent. His new film Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is as vibrant as a cluttered wall of graffiti jumpy enough to risk retina damage. This busy fizzy visual concoction in the occasional quiet moment can be recognized as taking place in the city of Toronto the locale of a series of a half-dozen cultishly-revered graphic novels by Bryan Lee OMalley. OMalleys stories depict the life of an underachieving part-time bass player who must defeat his girlfriends seven ""evil exes"" to win her heart. Shot by Bill Pope (the same cinematographer as The Matrix films) Scott Pilgrim is one of those films that exist not as a record of reality but as a creation in movie-screen space. The screen divides like a time-lapse image of cellular mitosis. The words ""whoosh"" ""thonk"" and ""ding-dong"" appear on the screen. The word ""love"" appears as a pink puff of gas. The allusions here arent to other movies but to newer media - comics text messages and video games. Here nostalgia doesnt mean old cars or classic rock radio; its visual allusions to arcade games such as Mortal Kombat Pac-Man and Super Mario. If all that sounds a bit bombastic for those waiting for the latest Jane Austen adaptation take heart. Theres a literary precedent here. Scott Pilgrim (whose name comes from a song by 90s Halifax girl band Plumtree) is a modern incarnation of James Thurbers protagonist in his 1939 short story The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. The American Heritage Dictionary defines a ""Walter Mitty"" as ""an ordinary often ineffectual person who indulges in fantastic daydreams of personal triumphs."" The modern Japanese equivalent would be ""otaku"" - a manga video-game-obsessed shut-in lacking in social skills. Scott (Michael Cera) is a 22-year-old whose younger sister (Anna Kendrick) calls ""chronically enfeebled."" As for the ""fantastic daydreams of personal triumphs"" - they begin after Scott meets the magnetic purple-haired Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who roller-skates through his dream into his life. Shes a preternaturally confident delivery girl who changes her hair colour to a bright new shade every week and a half and comes with weighty baggage To date her Scott must transform from wallflower to whupass master. The video-game-style battles go by in a series of set-piece flurries as Scott confronts enemies that include a pompous movie star (Chris Evans) and his horde of stunt doubles on the steps of Casa Loma and a vegan stud ( Superman Returns star Brandon Routh) confronted after a concert at Toronto rock club Lees Palace. At the ultimate game level he confronts a weasely showbiz agent (Jason Schwartzman). At the same time Scott must deal with his own history his heartbroken ex-girlfriend-turned-stalker Knives and another former-girlfriend-turned-rock-star Envy Adams (Brie Larson) a.k.a The Girl Who Kicked his Heart in the Ass. Thats not to forget his well-defined fellow band members from Sex Bob-Omb (Mark Webber Johnny Simmons and Alison Pill). A movie that bears some of the burdens of originality Scott Pilgrim is exhilar-austing and super-duper-ficial. Wright and co-screenwriter Michael Bacall manage to keep this sprawling cast of characters and story coherent and often startlingly funny but the opportunities for identifying with these characters are limited. The casting of Michael Cera as the familiar puppy-eyed anti-hero feels like narrative shorthand obviating the necessity for explaining Scotts history. Other characters are quick-sketch assemblages of brief quirky traits and in-jokes. You need to take a step back to see the emotional heart of the story an allegory of a generation struggling to exchange the solipsistic Xbox triumphs for awkward real-world love and empathy.

To win the audience Scott Pilgrim vs. the World must first defeat the seven evils of insipid summer filmmaking. Evil 1 Slack direction. (K-POW) This the mother of all cinematic evils is vanquished at the hand of director Edgar Wright -- the raucous English spoofmaster behind Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead. He brings his gift for genre tweaking to the realms of comix and pixelated old-school video gaming and the result explodes like Pop Rocks. Evil 2 Humdrum visuals. (ZUM) In telling the tale of Scott (Michael Cera) a bassist in a crunchy rock band and Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) his dream-girl-with-baggage the film mashes up visual cues with madhouse brio. Like American Splendor before it Scott Pilgrim vs. the World incorporates panels from its source material Bryan Lee OMalleys graphic novels. It also throws in captions character I.D.s split screens phonetic noise bombs and all other manner of optical cleverness. When someone plays bass the instrument spits out D-D-Ds. When people kiss little pink hearts float from their lips. Evil 3 Unimaginative humorless screenwriting. (WHUMP) Movies that suffer from this particular evil disgorge cliches in violent heaves. Scott does not. Instead it tosses off loopy loving parodies of video game conventions at breakneck speed. Structurally the screenplay (by Wright and Michael Bacall) resembles that other gaming-inspired movie Prince of Persia The Sands of Time a brain-dead affair Im truly sorry to mention. Just as Dastan must navigate successive levels of villainy Scott must progress through chop-socky face-downs with those seven maleficent exes. Evil 4 Bloated self-importance. (KROW) Knowing self-mockery is the name of the game. One of the bad guys is an evil vegan portrayed by Superman himself Brandon Routh. Another is a narcissistic action star played by Chris Evans Fantastic Fours Human Torch. Evil 5 Clumsy editing. (THONK) With so many crazy effects this could have been disastrous. But Scott Pilgrim vs. the World quells the enemy with swift seamless editing that hitches together rapid-fire shots to hilarious effect. One of the best has Kieran Culkin as Scotts mordant roommate firing off a text message in his sleep. Evil 6 Dearth of Seinfeld references. (PAF) Couldnt every movie use a few? Scott Pilgrim lifts the bass licks and the laugh track however briefly. And finally ... Evil 7 Michael Ceras typecasting. Oh wait. Wrights film doesnt defeat this evil; it exploits it. In so doing it offers the last word on the signature Cera mousiness - that voice-cracking adenoidal hipster-dweeb routine thats served him so well so far. How many more roles of this sort he can endure (or I can endure) before he assumes some other M.O. isnt exactly clear. But for now going a few more rounds in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World he handily beats back the evils of boredom.

"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a delightful package of cinematic Pop Rocks. Slate Sign In Sign Up Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a delightful package of cinematic Pop Rocks. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a delightful package of cinematic Pop Rocks. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Aug. 13 2010 1230 PM Scott Pilgrim vs. the World A delightful package of cinematic Pop Rocks. By Dana Stevens Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (Universal) is a package of cinematic Pop Rocks a neon-hued defiantly non-nutritive confection that nonetheless makes you laugh at its sheer bold novelty. The pleasure of seeing this movie came as a surprise given that my oversaturation with superhero or comic-book-related movies is now reaching medically dangerous levels. Scott Pilgrim was originally a series of comics by Canadian artist Bryan Lee OMalley; after being published as a book it has been adapted by British director Edgar Wright. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Wright may be one of the most exciting up-and-coming comic directors--not just a director of comedians but a comic director. His previous films Shaun of the Deadand Hot Fuzz are tightly scripted tonally precise spoofs not shaggy collections of skits in the American style. Given Wrights knack for affectionate genre-skewering (the zombie movie in Shaun of the Dead the cop thriller in Hot Fuzz) a comic-book movie seems like natural material for him. Advertisement Overexplaining Scott Pilgrims plot would take away from the Pop Rock-exploding fun. Scott (Michael Cera) is the 22-year-old bassist for a mediocre Toronto punk band called Sex Bob-Omb. (Their songs which I found a bit too realistically mediocre were written by Beck.) Scott has a sassy gay roommate (Kieran Culkin) a meddling sister (Anna Kendrick) and a girlfriend Knives Chau (Ellen Wong) a Sex Bob-Omb superfan whos still in high school. But Scott falls hard when the purple-haired poker-faced Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) moves to town. To win her he must not only summon the courage to break up with Knives; he must defeat an evil legion of Ramonas seven exes who include a vegan rock star (Brandon Routh) a Bollywood-dancing Goth (Satya Bhabha) and twin Japanese DJs (Shota and Keita Saito). The clashes between Scott and his foes are cheerfully hyperbolic. One punch can send its victim flying for half a block as in a Warner Bros. cartoon. When the bad guys are done for they dissolve into heaps of gold coins as a video-game score flashes on the screen. (Text is constantly zipping through the frame in this movie including written sound effects ""Thud"" ""Wham"" ""BRrrrring"") The fight scenes do get repetitive toward the end; seven exes make for a lot of vanquishing and these battles are not short. But I admire the surefootedness with which Wright skips between psychological realism and formal playfulness. The boundary between whats taking place in the real world and whats a projection of Scotts psyche remains fluid--does it matter whether the exes hes battling actually have superpowers or whether it just feels that way? Cera who can be a brilliant comic in the right role doesnt get enough to do here. Yes he makes for a sweet romantic lead but its the combination of that quality with an acerbic dry wit thats the added value of casting Michael Cera. Hes less miscast than misused as Scott the hapless straight man at the center of a swirl of edgier more crisply defined characters the clingy but loyal Knives the glamorous but dithering Ramona and the devilish roomie Wallace who may be remembered as Kieran Culkins first great grownup role. Watching Scott Pilgrim vs. the World feels ADD-inducing but agreeably so; its like letting a pinball ding noisily around inside your head bouncing off targets and racking up points. Rather than lazily relying on the audiences prior knowledge of the comic book Wright re-creates the experience of reading it for us in a rhythmic onslaught of bright punchy images. But the best gags in this nimble little movie are the grace notes like the sitcom-style laugh track that accompanies Scotts exchanges with his roommate or the smug high-five exchanged by two cops as they sprint away from a crime scene. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World has its flaws but any movie that can make me sit up and take notice of post-adolescent superheroes in the summer of 2010 must have some kind of magic.

If you think theres a widening generation gap in popular entertainment -- and if you saw ""Kick-Ass"" you know it -- its because the 30s-and-unders the Millennials had their tastes wired at birth. Unlike the Baby Boomers they cant imagine a world without music videos video games and manga comics. They were raised on fast cutting extreme violence and self-mocking irony. And thats why todays movies look the way they do. A case in point is ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World."" Its hero plays bass in an alternative rock band. Its fight scenes are shot like video games. And its based on a graphic novel. Whats not to like? Well to many older viewers everything. Theyll find the film too loud too violent and way too full of Michael Cera. All of which it is. But its stylish too and while its silly it knows it. The question is is that enough? Movie Review Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (PG-13) Universal (112 min.) Directed by Edgar Wright. With Michael Cera Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Now playing in New Jersey. Ratings note The film contains cartoon violence and sexual situations Stephen Whittys review TWO AND A HALF STARS The story features Cera as Scott a sincere but dweebish twentysomething dating a 17-year-old Chinese-Canadian girl named Knives. Then he falls for Ramona a frosty woman with neon hair. Ramona looks at him like a piece of chewing gum stuck to her Doc Martens. He looks at her in awe. Soon theyre in love or at least in bed. Theres just one problem. She has seven ex-lovers and before he can win her heart Scott must face each in a duel. The story is obviously ridiculous if not on the edge of offensive. Scotts teen girlfriend plays into porn-like stereotypes of underage Asians. His devotion to Ramona is so self-abasing its masochistic. That everyone in the film is aware of this doesnt make it much easier to take. Yet to director Edgar Wright -- who made the deadpan zombie comedy ""Shaun of the Dead"" -- the self-awareness is the saving grace. As long as nothing is taken seriously everything is permitted from leaps in logic to caddish heroes. Unfortunately that gives the movie license to be lazy. The interesting theme of one-way passion -- Knives for Scott Scotts for Ramona -- is strenuously avoided. The fight scenes like the cheapest kind of computer games feature an endless loop of the same few kung-fu moves. At least Wrights way of shooting them -- with video-game graphics and graphic-novel ""panels"" -- is fresh. So is the pretty good music by Beck from Scotts supposedly pretty bad band Sex Bob-omb. There are also some fun performances including a surprising Kieran Culkin as Scotts sly gay roommate. But Ceras still playing the same-old same-old Cera all adenoidal angst. And his leading lady Mary Elizabeth Winstead is just a warmed-over casserole of those dead-cool misfits -- a bit of Kat Denning here a touch of Zooey Deschanel there -- who live to inspire gawky boys in Millennial romantic comedies. Unfortunately theyre the stars and theyre not quite enough to lift ""Scott Pilgrim"" above the status of live-action comic book (or is that widescreen video game?). But thats okay. This is a movie made for people who dont need it to be more than that -- loud and fast and taking absolutely nothing seriously. Including them.

The hero is played by Michael Cera (yes you read that right). Starring Michael Cera Mary Elizabeth Winstead Kieran Culkin Chris Evans Anna Kendrick Brandon Routh Alison Pill Jason Schwartzman Ellen Wong Satya Bhabha Director Edgar Wright Release Opened Aug 13 2010  Editorial Review Only fans will care who winsBy Ann HornadayFriday August 13 2010""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" is a dog-frequency movie enjoyable only to those tuned in to its particular register. Based on a graphic novel by Bryan Lee OMalley this hyper-kinetic pop-culture pastiche stars Michael Cera -- he of the quavery voice and dilated gaze -- as the title character a 22-year-old Lothario and would-be rocker who meets the girl of his dreams then sets out to defeat her seven exes to gain her love. Love actually has little to do with it in a story populated by progressively snarkier self-involved characters. Stripped of his doe-eyed looks and indie-nerd style Pilgrim is a selfish jerk; Ramona V. Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who in her rainbow-colored pageboys resembles a grown-up version of Hit-Girl from the eerily similar ""Kick-Ass"" isnt much warmer looking on with a blase shrug as her suitor risks life and limb on her behalf. The two are surrounded by a posse of equally snarly eye-rolling hipsters the biggest neg-heads being Kim Pine (Alison Pill) the drummer in Pilgrims band and his roommate Wallace Wells (Kieran Culkin) whose sexual orientation provides nearly endless fodder for gay jokes. The only sympathetic character is a high schooler named Knives Chau (Ellen Wong) who in a romantic fantasy only a boy could conceive gamely urges him to follow Ramona even after cruelly dumping her. The story and characters of ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" then are negligible. But fans of the novel arent likely to care reserving their most passionate interest for how director Edgar Wright (""Shaun of the Dead"" ""Hot Fuzz"") has brought their precious antihero to the screen. The short answer every which way he can borrowing references from video games cartoons sitcoms and other movies to create a multi-layered collage that makes the levels of ""Inception"" look like a toddlers Tinkertoy project. There are funny moments The films best fight is between Pilgrim and Todd Ingram (Brandon Routh) a buff-but-dumb vegan who becomes hoisted on his own self-righteous petard. But what Wright possesses in a talent for swift visually rich image-making he lacks in a sense of pacing and proportion. He dials ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" up to 11 within minutes leaving him nowhere to take the narrative energy. Trippy on-screen titles (""Riiiing"" when a telephone rings ""Dddddd"" when someone plays the bass) Super Mario Bros. graphics light saber duels jump cuts screen wipes zingers quips and doggerel -- its all played with the same emphasis and knowing insularity. Unless you can hear its particular whistle ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" is a grind as monotonous and enervating as one long sneering in-joke.Contains stylized violence sexual content profanity and drug references.

Photo nbc ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" is a big warm cinematic jelly doughnut stuffed with youth vitality style whimsy and other equally alarming properties. I tried to love it. But after 20 minutes I sensed I was intruding on the movies love affair with itself. Michael Cera presides as a bass-playing 22-year-old hoping to dump one girlfriend (her name is Knives) and get with another (Ramona) while fighting off the latters evil exes in a series of battles. Each time the characters turn into live-action video-game figures and the screen fills with colorful captions. Fwomp Ker-Pow MORE ALTERNATE ENDING REVEALED MORE FROM PANEL TO SCREEN And ka-thunk. The (many) video-game spoofs are all essentially the same really long joke. As they get jumbled in with the pop-up boxes providing factoids on the setting the scribbled words ""DING-DONG"" floating out of doorbells and an animated black box that keeps popping in over a girls mouth every time she curses the aesthetic is . . . hectic. I go to the movies to escape this prevailing brain-scramble of our time. Director Edgar Wright (""Hot Fuzz"") will have only himself to blame if excited kids are so razzled and dazzled that they power on their pocket gadgets and start Prattering or Twixting or whatever it is youth does these days. ""Scott Pilgrim"" is made to be viewed on such a gizmo one equipped with a fast-forward function. Daffy endearing touches and quotable lines bounce and poing. Ceras grandmaster-level deadpan -- picked up by a cast that includes Jason Schwartzman Chris Evans (who is funny for once as a vain movie star) Kieran Culkin Aubrey Plaza and Anna Kendrick -- brings out the funny in an irony-encrusted script based on a series of graphic novels. ""Do you know Pac-Man?"" ""I know of him."" A lady who no longer loves ladies is a ""has-bian."" A battle cry runs ""Die Obviously"" And this must be the first movie to turn AOL and ""Seinfeld"" into punch lines indicating the presence of rusty retro. But this ninja rodeo this chaos prom this pulsing grenade of irony cant sustain itself. Burn hard burn out. Even if it had run half an hour shorter it would have been an hour too long. There can be laughs in anti-comedy and random weirdness (""He punched a hole in the moon for me. It was pretty crazy"" ""No vegan diet no vegan powers""). But hip can be a strain. (I couldnt figure out if I was supposed to laugh because one character is randomly named Stephen Stills. Have 22-year-olds even heard of that folky geezer?) And it takes close to 40 minutes for the plot such as it is to kick in. Even then the movie just skitters this way and that taking its time to set up the big decision about which girl Scott will choose -- Knives or Ramona. But theyre both cool. Scotts cool. Everythings cool. So nothing matters. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next TV comedy The Office is coming to China Ricky Gerva...

"Review Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a blast of fresh air - Mercury News Hot Topics San Diego cop killed Big Sur fire Michael Parros Lake Tahoe warming Keith Urban Alphabet hiring Star Parties Facebook tax bill Brock Turner case Ask Amy SV150 Print Email Font ResizeReview Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a blast of fresh airBy Charlie McCollumcmccollummercurynews.comPosted 08/12/2010 120000 AM PDTUpdated 08/12/2010 045124 PM PDT Movie showtimes info Eat Pray Love The Expendables The Oxford Murders Patrik Age 1.5 Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World Tales From Earthsea Toyos Camera Vengeance Interviews with the stars hot new trailers At the age of 22 Scott Pilgrim is living an aimless life.Hes jobless lives in a dump of a basement apartment with a gay roommate who would prefer more privacy and is dating a girl from a Catholic high school. He plays bass in a third-rate (maybe fourth-rate) rock band going absolutely nowhere on the local club scene. In other words hes got lame and loser written all over him.Then he meets the enigmatic but striking Ramona Flowers who really gets his attention by rollerblading through his mind. But the only way he can date her (yeah shes inexplicably interested in him) is by defeating her seven superpowered evil exes in combat.If this sounds more than a bit loopy it is -- and thats part of the charm of ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" a wildly inventive funny hypercharged film from British filmmaker Edgar Wright whose ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" were witty deconstructions of the zombie and buddy-cops genres respectively. Based on the graphic novels of Bryan Lee OMalley ""Scott Pilgrim"" is a cinematic mashup of the first order managing to combine (and spoof) elements of modern teen romantic comedies superhero flicks and arcade games of the ""Street Fighter"" era. Tossed in for good measure references to manga-style comics indie rock at its best and worst (much of the music is by Beck) sound cues from Nintendo games and Apple computers and even nods to the ""Batman"" television series of the 1960s.Advertisement The film has its flaws and falters toward the end but for most of its hour and 53 minutes its a dazzling and thoroughly engaging ride through a fantasy world born of Wrights (and OMalleys) vivid imaginations.Wright does an excellent job with the setup for the fights -- with the League of Evil Exes -- that take up much of the movie. He quickly sketches the rather sad life of Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera of ""Juno"" and ""Superbad"" who seems to have cornered the market on slacker dude roles). He may be dating his high school girlfriend one Knives Chau (newcomer Ellen Wong) but theyve never held hands. His band -- with frontman Stephen Stills (Mark Webber of ""The Memory Thief"") and one of Scotts exes the caustic Kim Pine (Alison Pill) on drums -- stumbles through rehearsals. (Pill a Broadway actress who has been in such films as ""Milk"" is terrific and gets many of the best lines.)His roommate Wallace Wells (a very good Kieran Culkin) and Scotts dismissive sister Stacey (the delightful Anna Kendrick from ""Up In the Air"" somewhat underused in the part) try to suggest he should be doing more with his life. Nothing much happens until he meets Ramona who seems way out of his league.Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) sees something in Scott and they actually find a connection. But when she goes to see Scotts group (called Sex Bob-Omb) in a battle of the bands the first of the evil exes -- a superpowered boyfriend (Satya Bhabha) from Ramonas high school days -- shows up complete with a backup group of demon hipster chicks.With that ""Scott Pilgrim"" is off and running as our hero (more or less) tackles a rogues gallery of baddies engaging them in the kind of bloodless video violence that marked the early era of electronic gaming. (When one of the bad guys ""dies"" he disappears in a shower of coins and a score pops up on the screen.) There is absolutely no explanation for how Scott himself developed superpowers; they just kind of show up and you have to accept them as part of the game.Wright who cowrote the film brings a wicked wit to the fights that extends to the casting. Chris Evans (the Human Torch in ""Fantastic Four"" and soon to be Captain America) and Brandon Routh (who played the Man of Steel in ""Superman Returns"") both play exes sending up their previous superhero roles. Routh is particularly funny as a bleached blond thoroughly vapid telekinetic who plays bass for a rival band and gets his powers from being a vegan. Theres also a funny turn by Mae Whitman (who co-starred with Cera in TVs ""Arrested Development"") but to go into details would spoil a running gag.As the film goes along things get a little exhausting and Wright never really captures the nuances of OMalleys work most notably his finely-tuned allegories about finding yourself and your place in the world. By the time Scott gets to the final showdown with the baddest of the evil exes the manipulative Gideon Graves (Jason Schwartzman of ""Funny People"") its all become a bit too much and what should be the movies culminating scene seems to drag on forever.Still in a summer loaded with predictable films Wright and his cast make ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" a blast of fresh air a smart fun and fanciful exercise in moviemaking that is quite unlike anything youve ever seen before.Scott Pilgrim vs. the WorldHHRating PG-13 (for stylized violence sexual content and language)Cast Michael Cera Mary Elizabeth Winstead Anna Kendrick Alison Pill and Kieran CulkinDirector Edgar WrightRunning time 1 hour 53 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Talend Silicon Valleys latest tech IPO has a strong debutSource Tesla looking at cameras radar in Florida crashCartoons Hillary Clinton makes history Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Joe Neumaier Updated Friday August 13 2010 818 PM Title Scott Pilgrim vs. the World Talk about style over substance The sheer volume of musical comic-strip and video-game influences riffs and licks in ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" can get exhausting but they also are what lift this romantic coming-of-age tale from this world to someplace totally ... else. Adapted from a graphic novel and plugged into some kind of mental electrical socket by director Edgar Wright this is a romantic adventure for the ADD age a pop poem for Millennials that could just as well be titled ""Scott Pilgrim"" vs. the Old Ways of Storytelling.""That Wright who previously directed ""Shaun of the Dead"" is able to pull it off despite some major hurdles -- the movies imitation of a twentysomethings eternally distracted mind the banality of the long-distance crush the near-deadly milquetoast-ness of lead boy-man Michael Cera -- is pretty remarkable. ""Scott Pilgrim"" is what teens will see while their parents try to figure out ""Inception.""Trippy is one way to describe ""Scott Pilgrim"" but only if youre not accepting of its ""Street Fighter""-meets-soap-opera scenario. Ceras title hero is a waifish 22-year-old in Toronto whos seen among his indie-spirited wannabe rock-band arcade-going friends as a ladykiller. His week-long ""flings"" with girls mostly involve puppy-dog stares that leave broken hearts in the chilly Canadian air.Scotts in a chaste boyfriend-girlfriend hangout thing with a high schooler when he meets Ramona Flowers (a totally winning Mary Elizabeth Winstead) the new-to-town blue-haired beauty whose New York past and constant surliness make her irresistible. Scott and Ramona start a kinda-sorta romance but to prove hes worthy he must battle -- video-game style with flying fists and jet-propelled leaps although its all handled as if its completely real -- Ramonas ""seven evil exes."" And in the process get to the next level within himself.Amongst his appealingly hip cast (Allison Pill Anna Kendrick Aubrey Plaza Kieran Culkin) Wright wittily adds some actors (Chris Evans Brandon Routh) known for superhero roles as past BFs while Jason Schwartzman has a scenery-chewing field day as the ultimate ex. They help save the day when the plot gets redundant and the immaturity is stifling but the real secret power is Wrights visual inventiveness; the whole movie is an eyeball surf into various mediums and styles that swipe across the screen like iPhone windows and keep you tuned in -- a good thing since Ceras high-pitched whine is such a huge turnoff.It could have become like ""Kick-Ass"" or worse ""Speed Racer"" -- an insulated universe you dont want to visit -- but instead ""Scott Pilgrim"" is a place most of its target audience wont want to leave. Although chances are theyre living in its wii world already.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Both of which make him the right dude for the job.Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a ridiculously entertaining romp based on the graphic novels of Bryan Lee OMalley and directed with mash-up mastery by Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead).In this epically charming if overlong frolic framed like a graphic novel (with attendant thought balloons and sound cues) Wright playfully shows how the simultaneity of social networking the structure of video-game quests and the language of tweet are redefining modern romance. Cramming every frame with as much visual and aural material as he can Wright is a guy who gets all the neurons firing.He imagines Scott as a Street Fighter Lancelot out to win the heart of his Guinevere Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) a mercurial punkette whose moods are as changeable as her hair color.To earn Ramona Scott first must dispose of her ""seven exes"" (as in past squeezes). And unwind his relationship with perky high-schooler Knives Chao (Ellen Wong) his number-one fan and stalker. And ignore his nosy sister (Anna Kendrick) and nosier roommate (Kieran Culkin) who are texting and kibitzing about Scotts every move.Scotts habit of looking at himself looking at himself as others look at him is both the height of narcissism and a function of modern technology that makes the user the center of the universe.It is also the stuff of a comedy that is both self-conscious and self-parodying in the manner of The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai. Meaning that people over 30 can enjoy Scott while getting only half of its pop-culture references.The first hour of the film was so funny that my smile muscles hurt. But into the second I started wishing Ramona had three fewer exes and could close the deal with Scott.How does one who fears that movies are borrowing too much on the canned visuals and ritualized conflicts of video games reconcile that with her affection for Wrights sneakily funny movie?His casting of recognizable humans with deft comic timing helps the cause. As does the witty deployment of musical cues technology sounds manga framing and great comic business. In a world where everything is zapping at supersonic speed stopping to watch a character sl-o-o-o-w-l-y tie his shoes is very very funny.For those like me who feel that gaming encourages technological isolation rather than human connection the films conclusion that love is a two-player game came as a bonus.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Based on a series of graphic novels by Bryan Lee OMalley Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World is a manga-doodle that draws from the wellspring of popular culture viewing youthful infatuation through a filter of indie rock action comics and a selection of classic arcade and Nintendo games. Its a series steeped in irony bestowing magnificent powers on an ineffectual Canadian who can barely muster the courage to talk to a girl yet reluctantly does battle with her ex-boyfriends. Theres perhaps no better director to bring it to the screen than Edgar Wright whose Shaun Of The Dead and Hot Fuzz are similarly informed by a culture-addled mind and he brings a great elasticity to Scott Pilgrim which stretches the medium to accommodate OMalleys comic-book universe. So why given its moment-to-moment surplus of visual imagination does the film feel so hollow and unsatisfying? Part of the problem is that the center doesnt hold. With his scrawny frame and total lack of affect Michael Cera seems like the right choice to play Scott Pilgrim a 22-year-old slacker who owns nothing in his shared one-room Toronto apartment and is perhaps the least essential member of an unfortunate rock outfit called Sex Bob-omb. When the lovely mysterious Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) comes into Scotts life its essential that Cera suggest some measure of heartsick passion especially once hes confronted by Ramonas seven evil exes who challenge him to Mortal Kombat-like duels. The disparity between these epic fight sequences and the low-stakes romance at the films core throws Scott Pilgrim fatally off-balance and no amount of graphic invention can entirely rescue it. Wright gives it his best Scene by scene Scott Pilgrim pops with bright three-dimensional flourishes--CGI done right for once--and the script adds a droll wit thats perfectly in tune with its gallery of smart sarcastic characters. Yet taken as a whole the films caffeinated energy burns to exhaustion in part because the intensity of Scotts feelings for Ramona are never articulated. The concept of Scott fighting the evil exes is a giant metaphor for dealing with the baggage that people bring into a relationship but Wright and Cera dont bring those gnawing pangs of jealousy and doubt across. Their film is an assault on the senses thats numb in the heart.
