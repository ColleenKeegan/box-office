The warmly observed opening scenes in which downsizing book publisher Will Atenton (Craig) his wife Libby (Weisz) and their two daughters luxuriate in their New England home are a testament to Sheridans improvisational methods. But production company Morgan Creeks micro-managing executives felt that Sheridans loose-wristed approach was ill-suited to the more generic elements of the films mystery plot so they put together their own edit. The idyllic house it transpires was the site of a grisly triple-murder about which cagey neighbour Ann Patterson (Naomi Watts) is reluctant to speak. As Will investigates these killings he learns some disturbing home truths. How much remains of David Louckas screenplay is hard to say but this bowdlerised cut - by tipping its hand way too early and erasing the blurred line between two levels of reality - is a well-acted but ramshackle mess.

That said I wish the movie had taken more time to introduce a wider array of characters to add to the mystery and had waited 20 minutes longer to show the twist.

The result is torture-porn thats also tourist friendly. One wonders whether and how hard the state worked to stop ""Dream House a tediously nonsensical movie that makes the legal system and common psychiatric sense subject to the whims of bad screenwriting.Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz trade Manhattan for suburban New England bliss. Naomi Watts lives across the street. Something clearly happened in the house theyve bought but Watts wont say. She cant because its That Sort of Movie. No one can say anything clarifying until of course everybody has to say everything. So we spend 50 exasperating minutes asking questions. How for instance could Craig and Weisz not hear a vanload of drunken goths playing seance in their basement? Do those goths have agents? Because theyre pretty good art directors.Why is a discovered roll of microfiche the closest anyone gets to the Internet or a library? Why does Martin Csokas who plays Wattss husband hate Craig so much? Why doesnt Weisz share any scenes with Watts even when theyre a staircase away from each other? How can Craig get any serious housework or home repairs done in such tight selvage denim? Does a book publisher as successful as the one Craig appears to be have no helpful connections in the area? Whats Elias Koteas doing on that commuter train? Its been 45 minutes when do we see him again?What are these actors and the director Jim Sheridan doing in ""Dream House (which wasnt screened for critics)? In Craigs case its to do more refrigerated acting. I imagine he liked the plot twist in David Louckas script. The twist is meant to answer most of these questions. I just wonder how Sheridan was able to communicate any of it to the actors ""Rachel stand here looking fabulous among these computer-generated flames. OK try doing that while leaning against the wall. He might have been drawn to the chance - after ""In America and ""Brothers - to work with another pair of oppressively adorable girls (Taylor and Claire Geare play Craig and Weiszs daughters). He likes them too much for a movie that needs them to be expendable.The film itself needs a genre it can trust. Loucka has written a murder-mystery psycho-divorce thriller with overtones of horror and movie-of-the-week melodrama. What does a director as earnest as Sheridan do with that? At some point Watts shows up at Craigs door and says "" I brought you some stew. But its too late Naomi.

"Dream House | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; dream-house ) Dream House (United States 2011) October 01 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Hours after seeing Dream House I was still trying to figure out how a movie starring Daniel Craig Rachel Weisz and Naomi Watts lensed by Caleb Deschanel and directed by Jim Sheridan could be such a disappointment. Its obvious whats wrong with the film; its not clear how things got to this stage. Was the screenplay credited to David Loucka this schizophrenic from the beginning? Or was some major tampering/reworking done at some point? Universal Pictures recognized the problem although too late to attempt a legitimate fix - thats why Dream House was not shown to critics before its release. When a film directed by an art-house darling and starring three such well-respected actors is hidden from the press the studio might just as well wave a white flag printed with the words ""Stay Away."" Had someone entered the theater and bodily dragged me from my seat about 15 minutes before Dream Houses end credits rolled I might have given the film a full star more. The fact is I liked a lot of this movie. Its atmospheric and as the narrative rolls along it becomes clear that seemingly apparent plot holes are not plot holes at all. The movie is engaging. Its a study in identity psychosis and psychological healing. Its the kind of film that makes you wonder how well it would hold up during a second viewing. 70 minutes into the 90-minute process I was engaged. Then it all collapsed. Film-goers and critics often speculate about whether a bad ending can ruin an otherwise decent movie. In a case like this the answer is a resounding ""Yes"" But Dream Houses catastrophic final 15 minutes arent just mind-numbingly dumb and head-scratchingly idiotic they seem to have been crafted by a script hijacker who didnt like the occasionally obtuse first three-quarters and wanted to inject a toxic does of Hollywood into a non-mainstream production. Watching Dream House is like having a pretty good dinner then being served a dessert topped with rancid mildewed berries. You forget the good parts of the meal as youre leaning over the toilet expelling them. Will Atenton (Craig) an executive at a New York City publishing firm has quit his job so he can concentrate on writing a novel and spend more time with his wife Libby (Weisz) and children Trish (Taylor Geare) and Dee Dee (Claire Geare). The family has recently purchased a house in a New England town and intend to renovate it so it becomes their ""dream home."" Then as is their wont in movies of this sort ominous things begin to happen. Dee Dee sees the face of a man peering through a window. Libby thinks the house doesnt ""feel right."" And a group of teenagers sneak into the basement through an outside entrance and hold a sA(c)ance. Will starts digging and learns that the previous owner of the house killed his wife and children on the premises and is now in a psychiatric hospital. As even stranger events occur Will turns to his across-the-street neighbor Ann (Watts) for answers. However even though she seems friendly she is unwilling to reveal whatever secrets she harbors. Although the first 30 minutes of Dream House come across as fragmented obtuse and generally odd the payoff occurs in the films middle section. Those who have seen the unacceptably spoiler-ish trailer already know the big ""reveal"" but it puts everything in perspective. (Note to potential viewers Do NOT watch any publicity material such as the trailer before seeing the movie.) Had the filmmakers possessed confidence in this line of reasoning and continued to explore the psychological impacts of living in this ""haunted house"" Dream House might have taken viewers to some tragic and moving places. Instead it drowns in artifice and exploitation. The deaths of young children must always be handled carefully; Dream House turns them into a plot device. For the most part this is not a horror film although it edges close at times and Sheridan throws in a ""boo"" moment or two. Its more of a psychological thriller although thats not how its being marketed and sold. Those expecting a Paranormal Activity-type experience will be bored out of their skulls. For its first two-thirds the movie wont be hurried; it moves at its own pace which is necessary to explore its themes and ideas. Its a great misfortune that the narrative veers off course then crashes and burns before the end credits can rescue it. Theres worthy material here and the skeleton of a gripping story but those elements like the excellent cast are wasted in what becomes a nightmare production.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet As William S. Burroughs wrote ""Its the little touches that make a future solid enough to be destroyed."" The problem with films that get the details wrong--like Perfect Stranger Passengers or the new non-thrilling thriller Dream House--is that when writers and directors dont build a convincing world to begin with its no great surprise or trauma when they start to take it apart. Just as The Usual Suspects wouldnt be much of a movie if Verbal Kints story was never convincing or interesting in the first place Dream House cant shock viewers with a ""nothing is as it seems"" reversal if it cant make them initially accept that things are as they seem. The movies biggest flaw is Daniel Craig trying to shuck off his craggy grim persona to convincingly play the warm even cutesy husband to far-more-effervescent Rachel Weisz and loving father to two adorable little girls. From the beginning he seems like an imposter; his smiles never reach his eyes his attempts at playful banter are borderline-creepy and the way he withholds key information from Weisz is disturbing at best. The world around him is just as unconvincing After Craig and his family move into a weathered suburban mansion he finds out a ghastly multiple murder took place in the house when he realizes his basement is ""infested"" with gothy teenagers who hang out in a room he apparently just hadnt noticed. His attempts to get more information from neighbor Naomi Watts and the local police are met with the blank-faced artificial stonewalling typically aimed at characters asking questions on Lost. The information he does get about the crime seems nonsensical or contradictory and his responses are equally unlikely. The many inconsistencies and mysteries fall together with an awkwardly delivered mid-film twist that puts Craig on more comfortable ground as an actor but the setup is sloppy the final payoff is sloppier and the 40 minutes between them is overly protracted denouement. Several things help buoy the material to the point where Dream House is only average instead of laughable. Weisz throws her considerable natural charisma at the problem bringing in all the warmth and ease that Craig lacks. The actors playing their daughters are surprisingly convincing. And director Jim Sheridan (In America In The Name Of The Father) and his art and production design team give the titular dream house a variety of appropriately contrasting warm and cold looks that make the place more of a character than Craig is. But the films ambitions are woefully small and familiar. Bad enough that its little more than a halfhearted support system for a too-familiar twist; it doesnt even manage that supporting act particularly well.

Nothings quite as it seems in ""Dream House"" an initially teasing variation on the haunted-house movie that pivots in a radically different uninspired direction. As an aspiring novelist with wife and kids in a large abode in deep winter Daniel Craig does everything to dispel comparisons to Stanley Kubricks ""The Shining"" with a finely tuned performance but the film flattens as it tries to explain his characters psychological state. Universals promo campaign necessarily suggests a different pic than delivered and this plus depressed word of mouth will equal B.O. foreclosure. David Louckas screenplay hinges on a dramatic twist at the halfway mark that fundamentally alters everything seen until that point; in retrospect the device is considerably more clever in conception and execution than its overall ramifications. Script is not without dramatic potential and indeed has drawn the talents of director Jim Sheridan Craig and his fellow thesps Naomi Watts Rachel Weisz Marton Csokas and Elias Koteas. But impressive as the combination may seem on paper having Sheridan direct this sort of genre fare reps a clear miscasting of helmer and subject as he displays no particular feel for the material and is unable to overcome the storys generic approach lack of striking psychological ideas and literal-minded denouement. Book editor Will Atenton (Craig) has decided to leave his Manhattan publishing house to write his long-in-the-works first novel in the newly bought suburban home he shares with loving wife Libby (Weisz) and their cute young daughters Trish and Dee Dee (actual sisters Taylor and Claire Astin Geare respectively). All is bliss until the first sign of trouble with across-the-street neighbor Jack (Csokas) whos fighting for custody of only daughter Chloe (Rachel Fox) with divorced wife Ann (Watts) and who shoots daggers at Will for no apparent reason. Composer John Debneys classically romantic cues early on shift in a more horror-movie direction as the girls think they see figures outside the wind-whipped trees bang against the house and Will starts to hear voices. The domestic tranquility is finally broken by the odd spectacle of Will rousting a group of punkish (and badly made-up) teens from his basement and of a threatening man evidently stalking the family from the front yard. Further indication that the picture were seeing isnt quite in focus comes from the quizzical sometimes wordless interactions between Will and Ann who clearly recognizes him even though he treats her as just a kindly new neighbor. Amplifying the growing dread Will learns that five years ago a family was gunned down in the house; the husband was the prime suspect but assigned to a mental hospital for lack of evidence. A brief and effective scene confirms that what haunts ""Dream House"" are not ghosts but matters of the mind. The films second half focus predominantly on Craigs increasingly worn and tortured face as he begins to absorb the dimensions of the puzzling situation around him. In theory this is a smart role choice for the actor pushing him into fresh emotional zones; in reality Craig merely keeps his head above water as the movie implodes in a string of misjudged scenes excessively literal exposition al passages and setpieces that have none of their intended impact. Weisz is most affected by this negative turn in fortunes though her role isnt much to begin with; Watts Ann who could have been a rich counterpart to Will is similarly underwritten and under-realized. Csokas and Koteas prove classy casting choices for menacing but one-dimensional men. Working in widescreen ace cinematographer Caleb Deschanel reaffirms his ability to establish a range of moods and tones by subtly manipulating light and natural conditions and creating a palpable sense of space. Other tech credits are merely standard including subpar special effects and some audibly post-dubbed dialogue. Dream HouseProductionA Universal release of a James G.

(Universal Pictures) Joe Neumaier Friday September 30 2011 1014 AM Title Dream House A man has visions and flashbacks of a family tragedy. With Daniel Craig Rachel Weisz Naomi Watts. Director Jim Sheridan. (132). PG-13 Violence. At area theaters. ""Dream House"" may be remembered as the movie that brought now-married Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz together. More than likely though it will be recalled as one of the strangest movies the current James Bond and the Oscar-winning actress (""The Constant Gardener"") have ever made. Clearly the foundations were there for a substantial project or else they - along with Naomi Watts Jane Alexander and Elias Koteas - presumably wouldnt have signed on. But if they had looked under the floorboards and examined the corners they might have seen that director Jim Sheridan (""My Left Foot"" ""In the Name of the Father"" ""The Boxer"") has been aching to make a haunted house movie since 2002s morbid rickety ""In America."" That drama about recent Irish immigrants rattling around a cavernous New York apartment as an artist named Angel dies of AIDS downstairs was a ghost film in disguise. ""Dream House"" is the full magilla with imaginary images sanity questions peek-a-boo startles and the usual are-they-real-or-not? characters. Craig plays Will who leaves his powerful job at a New York publishing firm to write a book. But back at his quaint Connecticut home where his wife Libby (Weisz) and their two adorable daughters await him things are amiss Theres strange messages scrawled in the cellar footprints in the snow outside the windows and the girls are complaining of faces looking in. Plus theres that murder everyone says took place in the house. About halfway through - minor spoiler alert here - its revealed that Will is not in fact Will. (If you didnt see that coming we have a haunted house in Connecticut we want to sell you.) He is in fact Peter and Peter isnt quite himself today as Norman Bates would have put it. Peter is quite familiar with an insane aslylum called Greenhaven has a strange connection to his sympathetic neighbor (Watts) and generally looks lost disheveled and gaunt. And of course Peter is the only one who can see Libby and the girls. Though a literary twist at the end calls everything into question. Though the cinematography by the great Caleb Deschanel (who shot ""The Black Stallion"" ""The Right Stuff"" and others) is gauzy and creepy Sheridans pacing is turgid and mournful which lends the story - sort of like ""The Shining"" crossed with ""Gothika"" during a sleepover stop at ""The Amityville Horror"" - an air of ponderousness. By the time the ridiculous conclusion arrives with five people arriving separately in a room as if this were Noel Cowards ""Blithe Spirit"" you wish all the wounded parties would hurry up with their emotional healing so we could all raise our eyebrows and say ""Ah clever."" Craig and Weisz though do make a nice couple and appear genuinely connected to the materials deeper underpinnings trite as they may be. These A-listers seem to be under the impression that they were making something not that embarrassing. Universal Pictures which released the film seemed to have thought otherwise as they released ""Dream House"" without screening it for critics. Not quite like running from a house on fire but close.

"Dream House Review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Dream HouseDespite the star power of Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig this horror-thriller fails to scare up any thrills.October 03 2011|By Mark Olsen Special to the Los Angeles Times Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig in ""Dream House."" (George Kraychyk )In the uneven new horror-thriller ""Dream House"" Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig portray a couple who have just moved from the big city out to the country where they hope to raise their two daughters in peace.Despite their newfound comfy domesticity things seem a bit odd for the family right from the start not least because Craig goes into town and talks to other people while Weisz never makes it more than a few steps off the porch. Its not a spoiler to say that it turns out a family was murdered in their house five years earlier and Craig might not be quite the innocent out of his element he seems to be.Directed by Jim Sheridan from a script by David Loucka ""Dream House"" feels like the filmmakers went rummaging through some kind of bargain bin of storytelling spare parts a a touch of ""The Amityville Horror"" a piece of ""The Shining"" a bit of ""The Sixth Sense"" and why not throw in a little ""Shutter Island"" too while were at it?Sheridan cant ever quite get hold of the tone and falls back on a default dreaminess (the little girls play a shaky rendition of Beethovens ""FA1/4r Elise"" more than once) that never quite convinces.With its telegraphed twists and clunky pacing the film would be unbearable were it not for the fine trio of Craig Weisz and Naomi Watts all more or less slumming. Craig in particular makes his characters transformation from happy family man to troubled loner sometimes within the same scene at least vaguely believable. (And perhaps signals whom this film is really made for what with no less than four gratuitously shirtless moments during a story set in a snowy winter.)As his collar gets progressively more dingy and hair less finely coiffed Craigs quicksilver ability to turn from refined to churlish reminds why he was such an inspired choice for the role of James Bond.It sort of needs to be mentioned that indeed in real life both Weisz and Craig each left long-term partners and recently got married. The strictures of the film dont quite allow for a sense of watching two people really falling for each other though in their few calm-before-the-storm scenes together the pair do have an easy chemistry that seems to disarm and lighten them both.""Dream House"" might not be a memorable film but it will always be remembered for playing into the personal narratives of these two ever-compelling modern stars. Its not necessarily their ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" but it shouldnt prove to be their ""Gigli"" either.calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESReview All Together a wasted opportunityOctober 18 2012Dolphin Tale leaps to top at box officeOctober 3 2011The 09 movies that stood outMarch 7 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesEntertainmentDaniel CraigDream HouseCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-dream-house-20111003,0,5187802.story?track=rss",200,dreamhouse7,dreamhouse,latimes

Daily Edition Login to download Dream House Film Review 1128 AM PDT 9/30/2011 by David Rooney FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Universal Despite the talent involved this is more a snooze than a dream. TWITTER Despite the A-list talent involved this haunted house tale is a thrill-deprived inert misfire. NEW YORK - Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz at least got a marriage out of Dream House which might be one reason to keep the title in their bios. But co-star Naomi Watts director Jim Sheridan and pretty much everyone else involved in this inert misfire are going to want to forget it fast. That goes double for whatever audience Universals thrill-deprived pseudo-supernatural psychological chiller can muster. Given that the trailer already divulges the films big twist while dishonestly selling it as The Shining in leafy suburbia the mystery is not what happened in the residence of the title or who killed the family that once lived there. The real puzzler is what merit did this project initially show to attract such pedigree talent not to mention a director who has carved a career telling emotionally engaging stories about real characters. Nothing in David Louckas hackneyed genre mishmash of a script - or at least what made it to the screen -- will supply the answer. Will Atenton (Craig) quits his job as a star editor at a New York publishing house to spend more time with his wife (Weisz) and their two adorable daughters (Taylor Geare Claire Astin Geare) while working on his novel. But they barely settle into their small-town New England home when bumps in the night faces at the window and teenage Goths holding candlelight rituals in the basement start creeping everybody out. The familys neighbor (Watts) obviously knows plenty but isnt talking while her angry ex-husband (Martin Csokas) snarls with such sadistic menace we suspect he knows even more. Will learns that the wife and children of the family who lived in the house before them were murdered five years earlier and that the father was suspected but never convicted of the killings spending the interim period in a psychiatric facility. As he begins digging into the investigation poring over news coverage questioning cops and doctors looking at old surveillance tapes he makes an alarming discovery. But anyone who has ever seen a family-in-peril horror movie will be ahead of him only to have the rug pulled out from under their expectations by the more-than-faintly ludicrous developments of Louckas screenplay. Dream House seems uncertain what kind of movie it wants to be. Its an old-fashioned haunted-house tale a poignant story of ghosts conjured out of grief a warped-perception mindbender a reality-based murder mystery a solve-it-yourself audience challenge. But in the end its none of the above just a convoluted yawn. Sheridan approaches the material as somber drama bringing a restraint thats classy if unjustified. But he rarely cranks the tension above a mild hum and the crescendo of violence and danger in the inorganic final act as the true villains step forward is too silly and over-plotted to fuel either suspense or shocks. Cinematographer Caleb Deschanel is probably incapable of shooting a film that doesnt look decent and in another context the snowy settings might be atmospheric while the lustrous warm interiors of the early action might encourage us to invest in the loving family at the storys center. But the movie is too terminally muddled even to offer visual pleasures though Craig fans will be pleased that no mere New England winter can force buff Will to keep his shirt on for long. Watts has little to do but look fretful and compassionate while Craig and Weisz deliver the required picture of blissful domesticity under threat despite being undermined at every step by Louckas script. The two actors do display an easy chemistry and tenderness that hints at the romance blossoming off-camera where lets just assume they were having a better time.

How does a movie directed by two-time Oscar nominee Jim Sheridan (My Left Foot) and starring Daniel Craig Rachel Weisz and Naomi Watts turn out this bad? Rumor has it Sheridan lost control of the picture to studio overlords and that neither he nor the principal actors are at all happy with what is now being projected onto unsuspecting movie screens. Assuming thats the case wouldnt you like to hear all the juicy anecdotes? The story about Dream House is almost certainly more entertaining than the story in Dream House which is pedestrian and stupid. It involves Will Atenton (Craig) a big-city book editor who has left his job to focus on his own writing and to spend time with his family in the house theyve just bought in a small Connecticut town. His loving wife Libby (Weisz) and adorable little girls Trish (Taylor Geare) and Dee Dee (Claire Geare) have been fixing up the place just waiting for daddy to come home. But the across-the-street neighbor Ann (Watts) acts skittish toward Will and her teenage daughter seems genuinely afraid. It turns out this is because -- wouldnt you know it? -- the last people who lived in the house got murdered. A mother and her two kids were shot to death; the husband was a suspect but was never charged. All in the very house in which Will and his wife and two kids now live Huh You see where this is going. If you dont you can watch the films trailer which freely divulges where this is going. What the trailer tells us and what we learn by the films halfway point is that the people who were killed are Libby and the girls and that Will has spent the last five years in a mental institution. His wife and children are not actually present in the house but are figments of his imagination (or ghosts or something). Also he doesnt remember killing them and doesnt think it sounds like something he would do. Once this information is out in the open -- after youve watched either 45 minutes of the movie or two minutes of the trailer -- there isnt much left for the film to do. Will accepts that his family is dead and even tells Ann across the street that sometimes he sees them an admission that Ann finds touching rather than terrifying. All thats left is for him to remember why he murdered them or else to discover who the real killer was. This process is dragged out for another 45 excruciating minutes. David Louckas tepid screenplay already a constant stream of mediocrity has painted itself into a corner there is no resolution that can possibly tie up the loose ends AND be satisfying AND make sense. The resolution Loucka came up with (or who knows maybe it was the studio or Sheridan or a Magic 8-Ball) is especially feeble. Its the sort of laughable melodrama that would be embarrassing as a 10th-season episode of Law amp; Order SVU let alone as a motion picture from a major Hollywood studio. Some of this doesnt matter as long as the movie delivers chills and suspense like its supposed to. We dont notice the hogwash if were too busy being scared. But thats where Dream House fails the most. Not a single scare is contained within these 92 minutes not one tense moment or burst of adrenaline-boosting action. To make a thriller as completely devoid of thrills and as blandly ludicrous as this is youd almost have to be doing it on purpose. And maybe thats what they did Wouldnt you like to hear that story?

"`Dream House review Scary bad |       NJ.com comments `Dream House review Scary bad Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 30 2011 at 300 PM updated September 30 2011 at 316 PM View/Post Comments (UNIVERSAL)Daniel Craig goes looking for trouble -- and finds it -- in ""Dream House"" There is something sad buried deep in ""Dream House"" something puzzling and scary and maybe even dead. Unfortunately it might be Jim Sheridans career. Whatever happened to this powerful Irish filmmaker? A theater veteran he made his movie debut with the brilliant ""My Left Foot"" in 1989 and followed that up with pictures like ""The Field"" ""The Boxer"" and the moving ""In the Name of the Father."" Then he did the slight ""In America"" from a script cowritten by his young daughters. Then he made the 50 Cent movie - wait what? - ""Get Rich or Die Tryin."" Then on to the fake and melodramatic homefront film ""Brothers."" And now hes doing a bad horror movie called ""Dream House."" How bad? It has stars Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz (who fell for each other on set) and Naomi Watts - and the studio still treated it like it was ""Saw XVI"" dumping it in theaters without a screening. Theres a reason. The dreadful script mixes a lot of ""The Amityville Horror"" with a little bit of ""The Others"" for a mishmash of cursed houses and hovering ghosts. Craig and Weisz are the for-now happy homeowners; Watts is the neighbor across the way who knows more than shes telling. Like the facts about a multiple murder that happened there exactly five years ago. Weisz and Watts are as warm and emotionally open as ever and Craig - who has seemed like a Steve McQueen manque of late - actually gives his role as a worried loving dad a little pain and effort. Unfortunately this whole film is a bit of a pain and an effort to keep up with. Police officers behave like no police officer on earth. Elias Koteas - the poor mans Robert De Niro - prowls around in the shadows. A first-act twist is so abrupt its less of an ""Aha"" moment than an ""Oh no"" A hurried tacked-on ending and some awkward expository dialogue - including several lines clearly dubbed during post-production - suggest just how worried the studio must have been early on. They had a right to be. Coming right after the straightforwardly spooky ""Dont Be Afraid of the Dark"" (and the purely adult shivers of ""Take Shelter"") ""Dream House"" isnt so much a nightmare as just a sort of nodding distraction. And the only thing it haunts you with is What the heck happened to Jim Sheridan? Ratings note The film contains violence and strong language. Dream House (PG-13) Universal (92 min.) Directed by Jim Sheridan. With Daniel Craig Rachel Weisz Naomi Watts. Now playing in New Jersey.

After quitting his book-editor job to spend time with his wife Libby (Rachel Weisz) and two daughters aspiring novelist Will (Daniel Craig) discovers that five years earlier his new home was the scene of a horrific crime...perpetrated by him This reality-twisting bombshell would be blatantly foreseeable even if it werent ruined by the films TV commercials since Wills conversations with Libby and their no-dimensional neighbor Ann (Naomi Watts) are dripping with things-arent-what-they-seem suggestions. Moreover said revelation isnt to be taken seriously as Sheridans tale soon segues into an unevenly paced whodunit pockmarked with lame CG nightmare sequences and populated by hollow ciphers whose every word and action is less believable than the last. Superficially shouting out to The Shining while squandering its high-caliber leads in melodramatic faux-spooky hokum Dream House also manages to commit a cardinal thriller sin casting well-known actors in ostensibly inconsequential roles which in this case reveals the real culprit before the mystery proper has even begun.

The pieces are all there but they dont quite fit together. When a movie with an A-list cast like Daniel Craig Naomi Watts and Rachel Weisz under the direction of Oscar nominee Jim Sheridan (""In America"" ""My Left Foot"") doesnt get screened for the press the assumption is that the studio has a colossal stinker on its hands. But if the makers of ""Dream House"" had been willing to knock down a few walls and get back to the foundation they might have really had something. The premise and the execution hold a lot of promise but the films climactic reveal will be incredibly obvious to anyone paying even the slightest amount of attention. Will Atenton (Craig) is a New York book editor who quits his job so he can write a novel and spend more time with his wife Libby (Weisz) and young daughters Trish (Taylor Geare) and Dee Dee (Claire Geare) in the beautiful house Libby is restoring out in the suburbs. Of course all is not well -- theres a lurking figure out in the shrubs every night the neighbors are somewhat stand-offish various bumps in the night are scaring the kids and then Will discovers a group of teens congregating in his cellar to celebrate the anniversary of when the man of the house murdered his wife and children. Will and Libby are understandably upset that the real-estate agent left out that little tidbit. Making matters worse the local police dont seem to want to be of any help with their guy-in-the-yard situation and Peter Ward the killer who used to live in their house has been released from a psychiatric facility into a nearby halfway house since there was apparently never enough evidence to charge him with the crime. And then ... well theres no way to keep talking about the plot without getting into spoilers so if you dont want to know the big twist of ""Dream House"" stop reading now. When Will visits the institution where the killer was sent he discovers that he is Peter Ward. While he always claimed someone else murdered his wife and children he was so haunted by guilt that he created a new identity for himself and all the conversations weve seen ""Will"" have with his wife and children took place entirely in his head in the run-down graffiti-covered old house where hes been squatting. But neighbor Ann (Watts) may be able to help Will unlock the truth of what happened that horrible night so that he can finally determine once and for all whether he slaughtered his family. While most thrillers would save a big twist like that for the final minutes so that we can realize how weve been fooled all along -- in movies like ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Shutter Island"" for instance -- ""Dream House"" takes the daring gambit of revealing the truth about whats going on in Wills mind halfway through the movie. And just when you wonder how the film can keep going after making such a shocking revelation so early it winds up having a few more tricks up its sleeve. Where the film goes fatally wrong is in making it easy to predict how things are going to wrap up. I wont give away the goods but lets just say that screenwriter David Loucka should be forced to needlepoint Roger Eberts dictum about ""The Law of the Economy of Characters"" onto 500 samplers in penance. Its too bad that a movie that actually manages to spring genuine surprises on the audience is ultimately betrayed by a clearly telegraphed ending because so much of ""Dream House"" really clicks from the early plot switcheroos to Craigs fascinating performance which shifts gears as unpredictably and as unsettlingly as the scripts revelations demand. Keeping pace with Craig are production designer Carol Spier and cinematographer Caleb Deschanel both veterans in their respective fields who do a great job of shifting back and forth between the ""dream house"" and the real one. And yes gossip fiends he and Weisz do generate terrific chemistry -- it was while making this film that the two of them became a couple despite the fact that she was still with her longtime fella director Darren Aronofsky at the time. ""Dream House"" reminds us that -- in cinema as in architecture -- one major design mistake can collapse the whole structure. Breaking News To Your Inbox.
