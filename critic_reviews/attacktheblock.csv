Special to Newsday + - In this publicity image released by Screen Gems clockwise from bottom left Leeon Jones Luke Treadaway Jodie Whittaker John Boyega and Alex Esmail are shown in a scene from ""Attack the Block."" Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT When voracious killer space aliens attacks a council housing estate in London a band of young locals fights them off. BOTTOM LINE Feature debut by director Joe Cornish shows flair for action horror less of a knack for endearing characters. CAST Jodie Whittaker Nick Frost John Boyega Leeon Jones WHEN/WHERE Area theaters LENGTH 128 The horror-fantasy-sci-fi genre is crawling with directors who know the horror-fantasy-sci-fi genre Joe Cornish being one of them. His audacious debut feature ""Attack the Block"" -- in which lower-class youths from a London housing project do battle with man-eating aliens -- combines the wry nastiness of ""Gremlins"" and ""The Thing"" with such siege dramas as ""Assault on Precinct 13"" and ""Escape from New York."" All this makes for a tautly wound take on the old B-movie as nationalistic metaphor. The downside? That the more the viewer knows about the genre the better he or she will like the film because character isnt Cornishs strong suit and nobody here is particularly warm and cuddly. advertisement | advertise on newsday It doesnt help that the main characters are thugs which makes the timing of this independent U.K. film notable; thinking about the recent street violence in London will be unavoidable given that our heroine Sam (Jodie Whittaker) starts off by being robbed by the same hoodlums with whom shell soon be helping fight intergalactic terrorists. Chief among the hoods is Moses (John Boyega) who does a terrific job of making his character convincingly dislikable. And who has a very personal approach to defending home (and presumably country) from slimy space fiends. ""Attack the Block"" is essentially an action thriller and as such is effective. The humor while considerable is organic rather than the result of Cornish going out of his way to make stupid gags. The kids sharply deliver Cornishs snappy dialogue and theres an air of mystery about the movie and its creatures. This may have been due to its low-budget nature but when it comes to horrifying abominations from the cosmos less can oftentimes be more. Here it certainly is.

"Attack the Block (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Attack the Block (R) British import about an alien invasion is a brash horror-comedy infused with social commentary. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com9/1/2011 Editor rating 3 ""This is the block"" declares one of the adolescent heroes of Attack the Block. ""We take care of things our way."" Set entirely within a tenement apartment building (""the block"") and the surrounding South London projects the movie follows five young teens (John Boyega Alex Esmail Franz Drameh Leeon Jones and Simon Howard) on one night as they embark on a typical regimen of criminal mischief and mayhem -- until ferocious snaggle-toothed aliens start falling from the sky forcing the boys to take up arms against the invaders and protect their turf. When seen under bright lights the extraterrestrials resemble the unfortunate offspring of a gorilla and a wolf. For most of Attack the Block though the otherworldly visitors are simply dark silhouettes with glowing eyes and teeth. They almost look like cartoons but they serve the necessary purpose the way that big rubber shark did its duty in Jaws. The primary concern of Attack the Block isnt cutting-edge special effects The movie is more interested in making viewers consider its disenfranchised protagonists from a fresh perspective. The fact that the film accomplishes this without a trace of gooey sentimentality is a small miracle. When characters die and several likable ones do you feel the sting of their death. But the movie -- like these scrappy street-smart kids -- never lingers on schmaltzy emotions. It just moves on to the next crisis. As much of a comedy as a mean little sci-fi/horror picture Attack the Block defies categorization. Everything about this low-budget Sundance hit grows on you from the delinquents we first meet while theyre mugging a female nurse (Jodie Whittaker) to the thick accents and slang that initially render the dialogue unintelligible (your ears become used to them though). With his debut writer-director Joe Cornish (who also co-wrote the screenplay for the upcoming Steven Spielberg/Peter Jackson collaboration The Adventures of Tintin) displays a knack for deft characterizations and action choreography. In one of the films best scenes the five boys who have now joined forces with the nurse they had previously robbed seek shelter inside the apartment of two girls who dont want to be bothered and arent putting up with this nonsense. When the aliens suddenly attack though the girls prove to be just as tough and resourceful as the boys Everyone here is a product of their environment. Attack the Block is often reminiscent of Shaun of the Dead another British import that successfully melded laughs with scares (the presence of Shauns Nick Frost here as a marijuana dealer cements the connection). But Cornish has bigger aspirations than a mere love letter to a beloved genre Here is a shaggy monster movie that pulls double-duty as a satire of class and ethnic barriers and how those barriers quickly disappear when we are forced to fight for our simple survival.

At the Denver FilmCenter/Colfax What fine happenstance that ""The Interrupters"" and ""Attack the Block"" begin runs at the Denver FilmCenter/Colfax today. The accidental double bill of two films concerned with urban violence couldnt be more resonant given Londons recent riots and Philadelphias flash-mob tumult. A commanding documentary ""The Interrupters"" (see review at left) follows three activists as they use their street wisdom to quash conflicts before lives are taken in Chicagos most volatile neighborhoods. ""Attack the Block"" written and directed by Brit Joe Cornish is a energetic genre ride with social ambitions about race and class. In a fictional housing project -- or ""estate"" -- in South London a group of young thugs and one feisty nurse square off against an invading horde of aliens. Moses and his yammering crew -- Pest Dennis Jerome and Biggz -- are in the midst of mugging Sam (Jodie Whittaker) a nurse new to London when a meteor strikes a nearby car. More meteors will rain down carrying larger beasts. And for reasons unknown the ""gorilla wolves"" as the lads describe them appear focused on the Wyndham House. The action is R-rated due to some splatter a lot of blue language and no small amount of marijuana. But youd be onto something if youre thinking it sounds like ""Goonies n the Hood."" Cornish rummages through the 80s pop-flick trove sampling Richard Donners kids-strike-back adventure John Carpenters ""Escape From New York"" and ever-so-briefly the French wonder ""Diva."" Like many low-income housing projects the complexs once-futuristic architecture has fallen into present-day disrepair. The ""house"" has become a concrete ""block"" although a dynamically shot sequence of the boys crashing into their apartments for alien-slaying weapons reveals glimpses of family life that are far from textbook disasters. The only flat we dont gain access to is that of leader Moses. On-screen newcomer John Boyega does the kind of laconic work that quietly insists theres more decency to the young angry teen than he lets on. And a game cast of nascent actors make Moses crew more appealing than menacing. The battlers are joined by two pint-size and crafty wannabes a slovenly grow-house dealer (Nick Frost) and his profoundly stoned customer (Luke Treadway) plus the annoyingly cartoonish gangsta Hi-Hatz (Jumayn Hunter). The director admits to being influenced by Steven Spielberg. We only wish he had applied a lesson Spielberg learned during his tribulations with the mechanical shark in ""Jaws"" Less monster can yield more anxiety. Of course like most space invaders the aliens here are a metaphor. But with their inky pelts and glowing rows of teeth theyre also not-so-scary letdowns.

Starring Nick Frost Jodie Whittaker Luke Treadaway Flaminia Cinque Joey Ansah Director Joe Cornish Running time 128 Release Opened Aug 19 2011  Editorial Review Thugs vs. aliens Bet on nobodiesBy John DeForeFriday Aug 19 2011Like the big budget star-heavy ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" the British import ""Attack the Block"" pits invading extraterrestrials against a breed of earthlings rarely called upon to battle them. Unlike last months film though this ones heroes are not archetypes from a bygone fiction genre; theyre nobodies yanked from the streets of a modern city. (The actors playing them are nobodies too.) Given what it does with its ingredients the film might as well be called ""Attack the Blockbuster"" - a name befitting a tale whose scrappy vigor makes Hollywoods products look cobwebbed. The title doesnt refer to blockbusters of course but to housing blocks the depressing and dangerous apartment projects where Englands poor live. For mysterious reasons aliens have chosen to attack a single South London complex the fast furry beasts (with mouths full of glow-in-the-dark fangs) singling out five young thugs who would otherwise be preying on innocent humans. Over the course of one long night the battle stretches from public areas where the boys are used to being feared to the living rooms and bedrooms in which theyre still seen as children. The movies panache and energy were undeniable when it screened early for critics several weeks ago. At the time its undercurrent of class-consciousness was simply that - a subtle theme with many precedents among them George (""Night of the Living Dead"") Romeros fondness for planting political barbs in zombie movies. But seen again days after riots overtook London the movie looks prescient maybe even important. It would be ridiculous to say English lawmakers should watch ""Block"" while deciding how to combat urban violence. But the movie does in its unpreachy way condemn societys two main ways of dealing with the discontented poor policing them into submission and pretending they dont exist. Take the way it opens. We watch as a young nurse walking home from work is surrounded by five men in hoodies and bandannas. A knife comes out; threats are made. Just as we fear robbery might become assault a meteorite slams into a nearby car. Sci-fi movies have taught us to expect even cheer for the quick evisceration of these criminals once we realize this meteorite carries an angry alien to Earth. (When Arnold Schwarzeneggers ""Terminator"" comes to town his first act is to rip a street punks heart out.) When it doesnt happen immediately - the head thug Moses kills the thing after it claws his face - we keep expecting it waiting for other monsters to eliminate the gang until we realize that were stuck with these undesirables for the rest of the movie. While were getting used to that dozens of fresh monsters fall from the sky. Not realizing how tough theyll be to kill the kids eagerly gather whatever rude weapons they can and rush off to chase and be chased. Writer/director Joe Cornish (an associate of ""Shaun of the Dead"" director Edgar Wright) is too mature to excuse the teens lawless ways or suggest we shouldnt condemn them; he simply forces us to view them as people instead of narrative objects then to root for their survival. All but one of them are played by first-time actors a couple of whom - John Boyega charismatically taciturn as Moses and Alex Esmail as a fireworks-loving smart aleck called Pest - shine even when more experienced actors join the action. But no monster movie endures because of its political allegory or socioeconomic savvy. Like ""The Thing"" and ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" before it ""Attack the Block"" demands to be seen simply because it is a thrill - a pulse-raiser whose perfect construction and pointed wit make it one of the years most exciting films. Cornish smartly uses local color (including the automated hall lights used to cut the blocks electric bills) to amplify a scenes danger then cuts to stoner humor (courtesy of ""Shaun"" co-star Nick Frost who plays a pot dealer) for just long enough to remind us what ""comic relief"" means. In the end police descend on the block at the very moment their presence becomes irrelevant. They misinterpret everything; locals watch as they blame all the wrong people. Soon their flashing lights will drive away and the block will go back to taking care of itself the best it can.Contains gory sci-fi violence drug content and the kind of language most people would use when being chased by monsters with multiple rows of fangs.

In fact several ""Shaun"" alumni are involved in the film including executive producer Edgar Wright and actor Nick Frost. Attack the Block Good Director Joe Cornish. Cast John Boyega Jodie Whittaker Luke Treadaway Nick Frost. Rating R for creature violence drug content and language. Note At Harkins Tempe Marketplace 16. This weeks new movie releases Invasion of the alien movies Is it as good as ""Shaun?"" Well no but few movies are. Attack the Block star talks aliens sequel ""Attack the Block"" does boast a loopy sense of humor fast-paced action sequences and monsters that look like ""big gorilla wolves"" as one character puts it. But if it never achieves that impeccable blend of horror comedy and drama that ""Shaun"" somehow managed it comes close enough several times. In ""Attack the Block"" aliens from outer space invade a south London neighborhood. These arent nice E.T.-type visitors; their teeth glow in the dark and they savagely rip up most humans they come across. Led by stoic young man named Moses (John Boyega) a gang of teenage hoodlums do battle against the creatures. The teens arent alone; they get some help from a nurse theyve just mugged (played by Jodie Whittaker also on screen in ""One Day"") and a spacey pot dealer (Frost). Writer-director Joe Cornish a British comedian creates a gritty grimy atmosphere with a good portion of the action taking place in a London housing estate. He also has a knack for witty dialogue ""Its raining Gollums"" one young hooligan explains when the invasion starts getting intense. Although there are plenty of laughs there are also some bits that noticeably thud. You expect Frost to be funny but his character adds nothing to the proceedings. Stabs at social commentary also feel overstated. Perhaps most strangely The movie is never quite as scary as it should be. Its exciting and there is plenty of gore for fans of that sort of thing but one wishes the mix of horror and comedy leaned a little more to the horror side of the equation. Still with its exhilarating on-the-cheap inventiveness its hard to complain too much. Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review When Humans Fight Back Cowboys amp; Aliens and Attack the Block are both bubblegum fun. But only one feels like it has a soul. By David Edelstein Published Jul 29 2011 ShareThis Franz Drameh Alex Esmail John Boyega Jodie Whittaker and Leeon Joness in Attack the Block. (Photo Matt Nettheim/Courtesy of Screen Gems) The inevitable blockbuster Cowboys amp; Aliens is an agreeable time-killer but Ill bet a couple of clever kids could make a livelier movie with a Woody puppet and a Predator doll. The filmmakersJon Favreau and five credited screenwritersmissed a chance to fool around with two disparate homegrown American genres and come up with something freaky and surprising. The movie is more Western than sci-fi but the cowboys are like Indians. I mean Native Americans. I mean people going about their business when all of a sudden a horde of plundering imperialist invaders descends on them. Now the boss-man capitalist the outlaw and even the Native American chief have a common enemy. It starts with a start Muscular blue-eyed Daniel Craig wakes up in the desert with a wound in his side a weird metallic bracelet locked on his wrist and no memoryalthough like Jason Bourne he can effortlessly waste baddies. Hes haunted but by what? Favreau is clever enough to withhold the pertinent plot details. With a narrative this hackneyed not knowing is more fun than finding out. No spoilers folks. But I will say its delightfully disorienting when the first shoot-out is about to erupt and thenwhat the heck ? The camera makes like Spielbergs tracking in on characters gazing in wonder at a glow on the horizon that turns out to be mini ships that whiz in and snatch up shrieking earthlings. Its too bad the aliens (amusingly dubbed demons there being no sci-fi frame of reference in the Old West) are a cosmic letdown. Their ships are clearly computer-generated and move too fast to generate awe. And the aliensapart from a Nazi-like surgeonare mostly CGI too and indistinguishable. They do have one odd aspect mandibles that open to reveal human-looking hands which pop out and grab stuff. Behind those hands are exposed internal organs ripe for stabbing an anatomical quirk that strikes me as evolutionarily speaking spectacularly nonadaptive. Rumor has it that Harrison Ford insists on having his parts beefed up so even in a supporting role (town boss) he has a lot of drawn-out scenes in which he gruffly bonds with sheriff Keith Carradines grandson and abuses his Native American top man (Adam Beach). Gorgeous cat-eyed Olivia Wilde stands around as a woman whowhat on earth is she standing around for? Dont think just ogle. NB Cowboys amp; Aliens is yet another PG-13 movie that will be seen by millions of kids that glamorizes tobacco use. Hero Daniel Craig sits puffing contemplatively after a big action scene and later a lit cigarette saves the day when one of Craigs henchmen nervously drops a pack of matches meant to light a mess of explosives. It could be argued that tobacco use was rampant in the old West so this is historically accurate. It could also be argued that aliens with disintegrating ray guns were not therefore the film is baloney anyway. So why make cigarettes look coolunless you have a deal with Big Tobacco? Joe Cornishs terrific low-budget British thriller Attack the Block could be called Homies amp; Aliens and it has whats missing from Favreaus impersonal Hollywood product. Its wall-to-wall sci-fi pop-culture bric-a-brac yet it feels organic. Theres something more at stake than the fate of a movie-ish Earth. The film centers on a roving gang of hooligans mostly black but with token black-acting whites who live in a South London housing project or council estate. In the opening scene they mug a white nurse (Jodie Whittaker) who gets away when something big falls from the sky and destroys a nearby car. As Moses the leader John Boyega (in his film debut) has the poise of a young Denzel Washington and a gift for appearing courageous and frightened at once. Mosess problem is his pridehe cant be shown upwhich is why he chases the alien kills it and carries it on a stick like a trophy. Its only later he understands that his macho instinct for revenge has caused much of the carnage. Not all though. These are nasty creaturesdescribed by one teen as looking as if a monkey had fucked a fishthat rip people to shreds with iridescent fangs. But the splatter is secondary. Attack the Block is the story of kids on their own with no viable authority figures one even wondering if the creatures werent sent to kill black boys because We aint killing each other fast enough. To defend the block the gangwhich now includes the nurse they muggedgrabs samurai swords and guns and fireworks. Its their chance to prove theyre more than societys castoffs. Cornish like Edgar Wright (who directed Shaun of the Dead and was an executive producer here) can parody a genre in a way that revitalizes it that reminds you why the genre was born in the first place. The movie is in a different galaxy than Cowboys amp; Aliens It has in both senses guts. 1 2 Next Share this story...

""Attack the Block"" is a British alien-invasion thriller that ingeniously blends two disparate strains of Anglo cinema or maybe three working-class realism social comedy and science fiction. (Calling all geeks The main location of this film is called Wyndham Tower and nearby streets are named Huxley and Moore. Discuss.) Ink-black gorilla-like creatures from outer space descend on a South London ""council estate"" (aka housing project) which must be defended by a plucky multi-ethnic crew of its youthful residents who might hitherto be described as muggers drug dealers and hoodlums. In fact I would argue that the snarling alien monsters are a ginormous MacGuffin for first-time writer-director Joe Cornish whose real agenda is forcing us to shift perspective on the teen gang members who at first appear threatening and then band together with a woman they robbed a few hours earlier. They are meant as the movies denouement makes rather too clear to represent a new multicultural globalized version of Britishness.At the risk of sounding stodgy and moralistic I felt ideologically bullied by this aspect of ""Attack the Block"" and spent much of the movie actively hoping that Moses (impressive teen actor John Boyega) the gangs stone-faced leader would get munched by the furry invaders. Moses and his mates mug and terrorize Sam (Jodie Whittaker) a young nurse whos coming home late from work and then deliver a fatal beatdown to the first invader who plummets from the sky possibly a female or a juvenile. Theyve behaved like sadistic creeps not once but twice and now were supposed to root for them when the aliens bring it for real? Sorry guys. You could argue that this is taking a bit of low-budget John Carpenter-style fun too seriously if the blame-society liberal guilt werent item No. 1 on Cornishs agenda (as it sometimes is with Carpenter).Ill stop ranting especially since other people clearly dont have this reaction to ""Attack the Block."" Or rather Ill stop ranting after I say that my problem isnt Cornishs overt political intentions -- I never object to that -- but the fact that he fails to sell them convincingly or package them with enough sweetener. If the movie has been massively overhyped in hipsterish movie-insider circles since playing Sundance and SXSW that really isnt his fault. And if youre OK with Moses and his junior posse theres a lot of cheerful anarchic humor to be found here. You Might Also Like Much of the enjoyment in Cornishs script comes from the almost impenetrable Cockney-West Indian-hip-hop lingo spoken by his young characters which he and the cast apparently worked out together ""Im shittin meself innit bruv? Nat same time -- dis is sick"" The police are the ""five-oh"" or the ""po-po"" or even less appropriately ""the feds."" Moses is a fount of stern catchphrases especially his growled ""Allow it"" which pretty much means ""yes"" or ""OK"" or ""word."" When someone suggests hiding in ""Rons weed room"" Sam the nurse wonders what that is. ""Its a big room full of weed"" explains Brewis (Luke Treadaway) a middle-class student who hangs out in the block in order to acquire the aforementioned herb. ""And its Rons."" Ron of the weed room is in fact played by Brit-comedy veteran Nick Frost which is as close as ""Attack the Block"" gets to a movie star. Boyega stands out in the crowded cast of teenage newcomers -- many of them recruited from the neighborhood seen in the film -- along with Alex Esmail as a motormouth known as Pest Leeon Jones as the bespectacled good kid Jerome and Jumayn Hunter as a genuinely terrifying drug lord named Hi-Hatz. These guys take on the aliens with a mix of improvised weapons BMX bikes mopeds and parkour moves and its reasonably good fun even if Cornishs action scenes are just above mediocre. As Ive made clear ""Attack the Block"" hovers in that uneasy zone between eager-beaver likability and trying way too hard to be cool but it captures its gritty setting with unusual affection. Science-fiction buffs seeking a change of pace and fans of British pop culture shouldnt miss it. ""Attack the Block"" is now playing in Chicago Los Angeles New York San Francisco Seattle Toronto and Austin Texas with wider release to follow. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Creatures from beyond the stars are constantly making cinematic pit-stops here for purposes ranging from ""Howdy neighbors"" to ""My dont you all look tasty"" This week finds two hostile forces taking over American theaters and though the basic story beats of the alien invasion genre are intact in both their settings and results could hardly be more different. The beasties in both Joe Cornishs Attack the Block and Jon Favreaus Cowboys amp; Aliens are inclined to subtle infiltration as opposed to the park-massive-spacecraft-above-major-city approach of those in Independence Day or District 9. In Block they arrive in the housing projects of South London in meteor-like pods their fiery descent camouflaged by the Guy Fawkes Night fireworks exploding all over the city. The furry black aliens armed with a mouthful of luminous teeth are here to breed though what it means for humanity if they succeed isnt quite clear. In Cowboys the somewhat more typically monstrous visitors -- large with sharp claws and simultaneously reptilian and insectile features -- are already here at the movies start. Like most travelers setting up shop in the late 19th-century American West theyre in search of both gold and a new place to call home even if that means subjugating or killing the indigenous population. One almost wishes the movies Indians could sit back and watch the settlers be decimated just so theyll know how it feels to be on the other side of the equation. Cornishs film centers on a group of teenage miscreants led by the aptly-monikered Moses (John Boyega). As he and his crew are mugging Sam (Jodie Whittaker) a young nurse on her way home late at night the first alien lands and with that the movie (and Sam) takes off at a sprint. The director doesnt waste much energy on exposition and setup there will be plenty of time to get to know this crew as they attempt to defend their block themselves and their weed from a steadily growing force that seems bent on going after them and them alone. Boyega is absolutely riveting leading with a stern glower and constantly trying to prove himself. Yet Moses has a deep well of tenderness and honor beneath the facade and Boyega almost single-handedly makes you care not just about his character but about everyone in any gang that would align itself with him. Hes that magnetic. Each of these characters has a distinct identity and Cornish engages the audience in each of their fates adding layers to their characters amid a steady stream of jokes heart-pounding chases and anxious horror movie set pieces. Much like another modern British horror-comedy classic Shaun of the Dead Block is irreverently funny without ever being spoofy. Cornish obviously has a deep love for the movies that serve as inspirations here mostly cultish 80s flicks like Night of the Comet and Critters. But his sharp wit as a writer turns the film into more than the trashy sum of its predecessors. The one-liners are hilarious and he has a deft touch at weaving social commentary on urban gentrification into the narrative by forcing the teens Sam an affluent stoner college student (Luke Treadaway) and a middle-aged drug dealer (Nick Frost) to fight alongside one another working out their issues on the fly. The scruffy chaotic appeal of Cornishs film which does most of its sci-fi trickery with practical effects stands in stark contrast to the polished professionalism and digital wizardry of Cowboys amp; Aliens. With two Iron Man films under his belt director Jon Favreau has a solid handle on how to deliver big-budget spectacle. And that gloss guarantees that the movie remains largely inoffensive even when the story fails to inspire. Daniel Craig and his icy blue gaze star as Jake Lonergan a bandit who wakes up in the rocky New Mexico desert with no memories and no trace of whats happened to him apart from a nasty wound in his side and a strange bulky bracelet firmly clasped around his wrist. Finding his way into the local mining town hes quickly identified as a wanted man but his stagecoach to trial in Santa Fe is waylaid first by Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford) a man he stole from and then by a sudden attack of aliens aboard small fighter crafts lassoing and kidnapping the towns residents as they swoop down. (clockwise from bottom left) Leeon Jones Luke Treadaway Jodie Whittaker John Boyega and Alex Esmail are the London toughs who defend their turf from 80s-era slime monsters in Attack The Block a deadpan horror-comedy that provokes real feelings for its mismatched characters. Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Sony Pictures You can tell Favreau is having plenty of fun hitting all of his favorite Western elements the silent stranger riding into town the gang of bandits Indian trackers the thundering hooves of a posse on the move. At the start it appears hes willing to treat the material with the winking tone a movie titled Cowboys amp; Aliens probably demands. Craig spends the first couple of scenes barely saying a word shamelessly (and satisfyingly) channeling Clint Eastwoods ""Man with No Name"" and Favreau gives Fords character a grand reveal that might as well bear the subtitle ""Yes I do realize Ive got Han Solo and Indiana Jones in my sci-fi Western and its pretty awesome dont you think?"" Ford plays along gamely having more obvious fun playing a quasi-bad guy here than hes had onscreen in years. But the restrictions of making a movie for the masses keep Favreau from taking the same kinds of risks that Cornish can in his film. Its easy to pick out whos going to have to die and whos going to make it to the end of Cowboys and that reduces the stakes to the point where the movie descends quickly from its fun exposition to a collection of meaningless explosions and predictable action sequences. Contrast that with Block with its consistently breathtaking pace and a real sense that anything could happen to characters that you care much more about. Based on a graphic novel Cowboys amp; Aliens never quite transcends the flat dimensions of its source material. Given the choice of which world feels more real and more worthy of saving from the approaching alien hordes I have to go with the potty-mouthed London lads.

"Attack the Block movie review Aliens invade the ghetto |       NJ.com comments Attack the Block movie review Aliens invade the ghetto Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on July 29 2011 at 802 AM updated May 30 2012 at 1055 AM View/Post Comments Screen GemsClockwise from bottom left Leeon Jones Luke Treadaway Jodie Whittaker and John Boyega in ""Attack the Block."" Attack the Block"" a new hoping-for-a-cult sci-fi film has a great idea What if aliens landed in the ghetto? Its easy to imagine that being an enormous hit 35 years ago. Sign up Isaac Hayes and Fred ""The Hammer"" Williamson have at least one character pull out a .38 and spit ""Bite this fool"" and Hollywood accountants would still be hiding the profits. Unfortunately ""Attack the Block"" makes two crucial mistakes It doesnt have great monsters. And it doesnt have great heroes. The plot is simple Suddenly on a summer evening in South London creatures start landing. The only good thing about their unannounced invasion is that it happens to interrupt a mugging. The victim runs away; the teenage muggers take up arms. Really make them adults and couldnt you see Jim Brown and Pam Grier offing these ETs for invading their turf? While a velvet-suited Antonio Fargas fusses in the background? Movie Review Attack the Block (R) Screen Gems (88 min.) Directed by Joe Cornish. With John Boyega. Now playing in New York. Rating note The film contains violence underage drug use and strong language. Stephen Whittys Review TWO STARS The first problem though is that these alien slimeballs are mere furballs -- hairy featureless black monsters whose only identifying characteristic are two double rows of blue glow-in-the-dark fangs. And sharp as those fangs are the monsters still look like well angry Muppets. Which isnt very scary. The second problem is that our heroes are criminals. And not particularly interesting criminals -- like Kurt Russell in ""Escape from New York"" or Vin Diesel in ""Pitch Black"" -- but stupid violent teens who take a knife to a poor nursing student trudging her way home. You want me to root for these guys? Sorry but Id rather root for the aliens. The movie typically tries to redeem these punks through the usual excuses (no parental involvement failed by society they didnt really mean to hurt anyone blah blah blah). And yes by the end they -- or at least one of them -- has grown into responsible manhood. Its an old movie story of redemption going back to the early Westerns -- wander over to the screen next door to see ""Cowboys amp; Aliens"" if you want to see the same theme played out on a bigger budget. But at least there Daniel Craig doesnt support himself by pulling blades on defenseless women. ""Attack the Block"" gets major credit for a few good action sequences and a handful of solid performances -- John Boyega is fine as that walking oxymoron the heroic mugger and comic star Nick Frost gets in some pothead jokes as the boys main connection. But for a film which seems to be reaching for the sort of serious social commentary of a ""District 9"" ""Attack the Block"" falls flat. You might find it accidentally on late-night cable one day and watch it through to the end -- and feel a bit guiltily entertained when you finally turn off the TV. But paying full-price to see it in a theater? You may just feel robbed.

JENNIE PUNTER The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 29 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English It would be easy to believe that the only way to battle unfriendly aliens is with military-grade futuristic weaponry - even when the hero is a 19th-century cowboy. But it turns out a motivated gang of five hoodie-wearing male youths armed with BMX bikes lighter fluid plenty of firecrackers and a ninja-sword knockoff can do the job just fine. Movies Attack the Block The official trailer Like the 100-million (U.S.) spectacle Cowboys and Aliens (starring James Bond and Indiana Jones) the nifty little British sci-fi action comedy Attack the Block (starring five terrific unknown male teen actors) gets an exotic jolt by telling its alien-invasion story in an atypical setting - in this case an isolated London council apartment tower (""the block""). For first-time feature director Joe Cornish who also wrote the screenplay this urban wasteland is a fertile playground - just the perfect spot to drop some (at last) non-slimy aliens and imagine how a bunch of loosely connected characters would behave during a localized siege. Attack The Block crosses midnight with matinee. Its a mash up of Gremlins E.T. a stoner comedy and a monster B-movie delivered with a visual nod to 1970s teen gang films and reflecting the comedy smarts of well Joe Cornish. Known for his work in pop-culture skewering Brit TV and radio comedy duo Adam and Joe Cornish will hit the global spotlight soon as co-writer (with fellow Brits Shaun of the Dead director Edgar Wright and Sherlock writer Steven Moffat) of Steven Spielbergs 3-D The Adventures of Tintin Secret of the Unicorn. We can assume Attack The Block is a more pure expression of Cornishs own aesthetic. Block may crackle with catchphrase-inspiring dialogue but its characters and their interactions feel straight out of the real block. Its all very here and now - except for aliens dropping sporadically from the sky which are largely and understandably unnoticed during the mayhem of annual Bonfire Night. The first alien crashes via a meteor onto a parked car interrupting the gangs mugging debut. Their victim a young local nurse played by Jodie Whittaker calls the cops about the crime (but later joins the alien-fighting cause). Moses - the gangs quiet level-headed fearless leader played by notable newcomer John Boyega - kills the nasty little alien and the gang drags the corpse to the blocks criminal headquarters a 19th-floor weed grow op for safekeeping. ""We need a manager"" says one kid as they discuss potential tabloid payoffs for their story. But a second wave of meteors hits. The boys swagger out to defend the block only to discover the alien monsters in the new batch are bigger and more vicious - and they seem to be targeting the gang. Frequent comic pauses are provided by Nick Frost (known best over here for starring opposite Simon Pegg) as the grow ops stoner doorman and Luke Treadaway as a superstoned university student just trying to pick up a little extra weed to sell. Stacked against this summers CGI-driven blockbusters Attack the Block is definitely the fastest action ride (clocking under 90 minutes) and quite possibly the most fun. As Moses and his mates would say ""Believe."" Attack the Block opens in Toronto on Friday other Canadian cities to be confirmed.

This spunky low-budget British action-comedy proves once again that a smart script can breath new life into even the most tired of subjects. ""Block"" does just that freshening the alien invasion formula by making its heroes a group of ethnically diverse would-be tough teenagers who live in a London housing project in a gritty neighborhood. Early on their attempt to rob a nurse (Jodie Whittaker) walking home from her shift is interrupted when a mysterious furry creature suddenly appears and hurtles past. The boys think at first that its a dog; they give chase kill the creature and triumphantly bear it home storing it for safety in the apartment of their buildings drug dealer (Nick Frost of ""Shaun of the Dead""). And thats when trouble starts. Ever greater numbers of the creatures but bigger and fuzzier than the first one and baring sharp snapping choppers that glow neon blue in the dark begin stalking and chasing after the boys and anyone else who comes close. First-time director-writer Joe Cornish (a comedian known in England for starring in TVs ""The Adam and Joe Show"" where he frequently spoofed major films by reenacting them using stuffed animals) is careful to give each of the youths a distinct personality and reveal the scared kids beneath the tough guy posturing. As for the creatures theyre ferociously feral but also amusing because they look like so much like overgrown chia pets gone wild. While its equal parts funny and entertaining and even offers some genuine scares ""Block"" also manages to give viewers a chance to really get to know its young heroes who at first seem to be the kind of kids most people would either cross the street to avoid or would simply ignore. And the boys themselves begin to understand after seeking medical help from the nurse whom they had tried to rob earlier and joining forces with her against the creatures that there just may be a wider world out there beyond their familiar streets. All of which contribute to make this a ""Block"" worth visiting. Note As with ""Trainspotting"" and so many other British films featuring characters who speak a somewhat rougher version of the Queens English it takes about five minutes for an American ear to adjust to the lingual flow while watching ""Block.""

(Handout) BY Elizabeth Weitzman DAILY NEWS MOVIE CRITIC Friday July 29 2011 400 AM THE GUARD -- 3 STARSBlackly comic thriller about an Irish detective working with an FBI agent (136). R Sexuality violence. At area theaters.To American audiences Brendan Gleeson is probably best known for his small role as ""Harry Potters"" Mad-Eye Moody. Thats a shame given his ability to take over the screen.So grab this opportunity to discover his outsize talents if you havent yet. In John Michael McDonaghs darkly comic crime thriller Gleeson plays Boyle an effective but ill-tempered cop whose fiefdom in County Galway is threatened by drug dealers. The uptight FBI agent (Don Cheadle a sturdy straight man) sent over to help is in Boyles opinion nothing more than another hurdle to be conquered.McDonagh indulges in too many 90s affectations from blaring chapter titles to philosophizing gangsters. But he captures his misty settings insular atmosphere beautifully.And hes wise enough to rely on the fearsome funny instincts of his star.THE FUTURE -- 2 STARSAn unmotivated couple is shaken into action (131). R Sexuality. At the IFC.Miranda Julys rejection of traditional storytelling is valuable but the common complaints that her work is mannered or twee are accurate.And in her second film about a quirky couple (July and Hamish Linklater) terrified by the prospect of middle age those distinctive traits dont take her very far.A cat confesses its inner feelings the moon wisely advises and humans speak in defiantly stilted cadence. Sometimes these characters say things worth hearing. But too often and in contrast to her first feature ""Me and You and Everyone We Know"" Julys calculated delivery doesnt reveal the profundity required to elevate it beyond a self-conscious deadpan.As a writer she has a compelling take on life choices but these are best represented onscreen by the less-showy Link-later. His actions are equally deliberate but more insightful and when he talks the method serves the movie.ATTACK THE BLOCK -- 4 STARSBritish thriller about kids chased by aliens (168). R Violence drugs language. At the Empire 25 Union Square.Remember when you watched Simon Pegg and Edgar Wrights inventive zombie comedy ""Shaun of the Dead"" and thought ""Wow I cant wait to see what these guys do next""? Well expect to feel the same about this monster movie from Joe Cornish.Though less ambitious Cornishs big-screen debut shares a similar sensibility mixing dry British humor and social satire with electric thrills. When some trouble-making kids find an alien outside their grim London housing project they set off a life-or-death race between species. Their only help is a nurse theyve just mugged (Jodie Whittaker) and a genial stoner (Nick Frost) so its really up to their young leader (John Boyega) to save the day.The cast is splendid the script quick-witted and the action satisfying. If Steven Spielberg and J.J. Abrams had turned ""Super 8"" into a low-budget B-movie it might have looked something like this.

This weeks other extraterrestrial- invasion movie is more funny than scary but thats not a bad thing. Theres quite a bit of wit in British comedian Joe Cornishs low-budget filmmaking debut which imagines what might happen if murderous ETs made the mistake of landing in a council estate Londons euphemism for its brutalist housing projects. Moses (John Boyega) a 15-year-old thug is being busted for mugging a trainee nurse (Jodie Whittaker) when the first one lands and dispatches his would-be captors. Moses kills the creature and plans to sell the corpse but then more of the bloodthirsty creatures start landing. Reckoning that the authorities couldnt care less about what happens to the residents of the estate Moses and his underage cronies form an unlikely alliance with some older and tougher gangstas and the trainee nurse as well as a drug dealer and his stoned customer. What follows is a hilarious slam-bang series of chases and battles that cross ""Gremlins"" with ""Assault on Precinct 13"" the two most prominent of many genre films quoted by ""Attack the Block.""

Photo Courtesy Of Screen Gems Attack the Block review Aliens vs. blockheads 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Attack the Block Action comedy. Starring John Boyega Jodie Whittaker and Nick Frost. Directed by Joe Cornish. (R. 88 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Attack the Block"" is the other alien-invasion movie opening today the lousy one the one from Britain. In Britain its probably just a regular bad movie but here - with accents that are barely comprehensible and in-jokes about council flats not to mention a swerving handheld camera and some of the cheapest effects since ""Night of the Lepus"" - its surprising this thing ever got released. Some unsolicited advice If youre going to show people imperiled by aliens make us care whether said people live or die. Or at the very least dont make your audience actively root for the aliens by showing your ostensible heroes mugging a young woman at knifepoint in the movies first scene. I imagine you must think Im exaggerating but no. The characters were expected to engage with the people for whom our rooting interest is simply assumed are violent street thugs. Sorry Im with the aliens on this one. ""Attack the Block"" is only 88 minutes long but just as time slows down for airplane turbulence and hits fast forward at the first sign of fun the minutes here stretch like chewing gum but like magical chewing gum that you hold between your teeth and need a 50-foot arm just to test it. It felt like days in there. Or weeks minus the hunger. And all the good parts? They were in the coming-attractions trailer except in context they didnt seem like good parts but like less-bad parts. Point being if I werent your crash-test dummy and proud of it Id have walked out within 10 minutes and thats only because I like to give movies the benefit of the doubt. Witless boring bad ... But no dont read any more about this you get the idea. Lets stop right here and never mention this again. E-mail Mick LaSalle at mlasallesfchronicle.com.

"Attack the Block makes alien invasions fun again - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Attack the Block makes alien invasions fun again By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Posted Comments Reprints amp; Permissions Why are alien invasions so much more inventive on foreign turf? By Liam Daniel Screen Gems Ride or die John Boyega leads a gang of south London toughs who must fight off an invasion force of monsters from outer space in the first feature film from director Joe Cornish. EnlargeClose By Liam Daniel Screen Gems Ride or die John Boyega leads a gang of south London toughs who must fight off an invasion force of monsters from outer space in the first feature film from director Joe Cornish. District 9 was a brilliant movie about crustacean extraterrestrials set in South Africa. Now theres Attack the Block a clever blend of sci-fi and comedy which pits toothy furball space invaders against young South London thugs. Ingenuity in alien design is a welcome feature. Both these movies avoid the all-too-familiar slimy look of outer space creatures who terrify Americans on-screen. Attack the Blocks monsters from outer space are a hulking hybrid of gorilla and wolf with long pointy iridescent teeth and a high piercing shriek. Horror humor and racial tension are blended in a startling way. A crew of young gangsters is thrust into the position of saving the world -- or at least the block -- from extraterrestrials. Things start with a bang on a night filled with fireworks and an impending sense of inner-city menace. A quintet of gangbangers led by the tough-talking Moses (John Boyega) mug Sam (Jodie Whittaker) a trainee nurse as she walks to her flat after work. Their mayhem is interrupted when an apparent meteor crashes on their block and the gang is attacked by a hairy creature that leaps from the wreckage. The teens ultimately kill the beast then lug the carcass around showing off to the local girls. But this was no lone space invader. Soon the guys find themselves under siege by other bestial marauders and the film cleverly keeps the audience guessing who will win in the contest between inner city and outer space. When one gang member suggests sending an alert to their friends another declares ""This is way too much madness to explain in one text."" The film both sends up and pays homage to the horror convention of bad guys getting their comeuppance by being devoured by monsters. As these toughs defend their turf against the savage creatures their apartment complex becomes an extraterrestrial battlefield. The special effects are surprisingly potent and the film captures a youthful sense of marvel even in kids who cop a world-weary attitude. Subtly our sympathies shift as these teens personalities come into focus. Empathy sneaks up on the viewer. ""I brought them onto our block and I have to get them off"" Moses says of his struggle to vanquish the snapping aliens. Attack the Block is like the edgy street version of Super 8 with its focus on kids who know more than the authorities. Director Joe Cornishs first feature covers familiar turf but does it with a wholly fresh twist. Set in a milieu thats exotic to American audiences yet familiar in its pop culture references this space invaders saga with its cast of unknowns is more innovative and exciting than the big-budget star-laden Cowboys amp; Aliens.

"Attack the Block Review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Attack the BlockBritish comedian Joe Cornishs debut feature works as both a sci-fi horror flick and a teen adventure film.July 29 2011|By Mark Olsen Special to the Los Angeles Times A scene from ""Attack the Block."" (Screen Gems )In ""Attack the Block"" the feature writing and directing debut of British comedian Joe Cornish an alien invasion occurs in a London public housing complex and only a group of teenagers seems to notice. Pulsing with a rowdy energy the film works as both a sci-fi horror flick and a teen adventure film. The greatest turn that Cornish pulls off is opening the movie with his protagonists mugging a woman (Jodie Whittaker) and still somehow making them seem as the story unfolds worth getting to know (while never excusing their nascent thuggery). Circumstances eventually force the mugging victim to join forces with them and their transition from hoodlums to heroes in terms of audience sympathy is simply remarkable particularly regarding the leader of the posse Moses (John Boyega). Cornish approaches his story with neither condescension nor nostalgia. The film obviously references 80s-era monster movies like ""The Thing"" or ""Gremlins"" in its visual style but rather than going for some vague ""makes me feel like I was 12 years old again"" sensation that is in vogue with the Comic-Con crowd Cornish creates something that feels fresh new and now. One of the films biggest laugh lines comes amid a hectic rush as one of the boys exclaims ""This is too much madness to explain in one text"" The film doesnt have the same hyperdrive pop consciousness as the work of Edgar Wright a an executive producer on this film and a collaborator with Cornish on the screenplay for Steven Spielbergs upcoming ""The Adventures of Tintin"" a and that is perhaps for the better. Cornishs film is smart but not knowing as he is obviously aware of what he is doing without projecting an overt sense of self-awareness. Even the alien monsters themselves part dog and part ape with glow-in-the-dark teeth and inky black fur like a scary shag carpet feel original. Spirited and exciting ""Attack the Block"" is so-called geek cinema done right. calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESWill The Worlds End be the most entertaining movie of...August 17 2013Movie review PaulMarch 18 2011Movie review White WeddingSeptember 3 2010Movie review Scott Pilgrim vs. the WorldAugust 13 2010Movie review Perriers BountyJune 4 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesFilmEntertainmentJodie WhittakerCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-attack-block-20110729,0,4710605.story",200,attacktheblock17,attacktheblock,latimes

Comments (6) click to enlarge Attack the Block Rated R  88 minutes  2010 Teenage thugs patrolling a grim council estate in south London are stunned when flaming asteroids begin to drop from the sky and disgorge space aliens who look like eyeless black bears with concentric rows of green glow-in-the-dark fangs. This low-budget sci-fi item was produced by some of the Brits who made Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz including their writer and director Edgar Wright but it hardly compares despite Nick Frosts brief appearance as a mangy pot dealer. John Boyega in his screen debut gives a serviceable performance as a cool Jamaican gang leader who battles the vicious aliens and Jodie Whittaker plays a young nurse who comes to his aid even though hes mugged her in the opening scene. Joe Cornish directed his own script which suffers from thin characterization weak dialogue and a confused ending; we never do find out where the beasts came from what they wanted or whether the extraterrestrial attack is even over.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Edgar Wright hasnt directed Simon Pegg and Nick Frost since 2007s Hot Fuzz but they all clearly have extraterrestrials on the brain. Pegg and Frost recently collaborated on the pretty good politely received Steven Spielberg homage Paul and now Wright has executive-produced Attack The Block a funky little cult-movie-in-the-making by his friend and writing partner Joe Cornish. (Naturally the two worked on Spielbergs new Tintin movie which co-stars Pegg and Frost.) Continuing the extraterrestrial theme the film concerns a motley multicultural crew of street kids who take on monsters from outer space. In a potentially star-making performance John Boyega plays a charismatic gang leader whose attempts to mug a pretty nurse played by Venus Jodie Whittaker are rudely interrupted by the unexpected appearance of a fearsome alien monster. Whittaker Boyega and Boyegas gang must subsequently put aside their gender racial and class differences for the sake of a common cause fighting off a mysterious alien plague. Frost is funny as a low-level drug dealer and National Geographic buff as is Luke Treadaway as a student who stops by Frosts weed spot to pick up some marijuana and gets more than he bargained for. Attack The Block has an agreeably scrappy early John Carpenter Dark Star/Assault On Precinct 13 vibe rich in moral ambiguity and gleeful smartass genre-mashing. Boyega begins the film as a heavy but by the end the filmmakers have persuaded viewers to root for a troubled teenage criminal committing violent acts in the name of the common good. Attack The Block turns its modest budget into a virtue by focusing on character especially the surprisingly charged complicated dynamic between enemies-turned-allies Whittaker and Boyega. As a high-profile A-picture Paul had stars and a big budget but Attack The Block has a clever script and winning underdog spirit that ultimately proves much more important.

Posted July 28 2011 -- 1200 AM EDT The extraterrestrial invasion in this tightly paced British sci-fi comedy isnt a national emergency its a local one. A young nurse on her way home is menaced by a group of teenagers -- slinging a machine-gun argot of luvs and bruvs -- but they all soon discover something far more dangerous roaming the streets of South London. There could be a few more scares and laughs but its a blast to be drawn into this urban ecosystem that is to us Yanks itself a bit alien.

Set in a sprawling London public-housing compound the film follows a group of teenage hooligans as they stumble upon and eventually thwart an extraterrestrial invasion. Led by the angry but reasonable Moses (John Boyega) the kids defend their turf alongside co-residents Sam (Jodie Whittaker) a nurse they half-assedly mug prior to the appearance of the ETs and Ron and Brewlis (Nick Frost and Luke Treadaway) two underachievers who serve as a sort of stoned Greek chorus. Things move fast enough to distract from the movies paltry budget--the woolly aliens or ""big gorilla-wolf motherfuckers"" as Moses calls them are plainly guys in suits--and give the film a Lord of the Flies by way of John Carpenter feel. (Joe Cornish the actual director is a well-known comic actor in England.) Attack the Block strains somewhat to deliver a climactic moral but the way it slyly shifts our sympathies to Moses and his crew (at the expense of another species granted) without overplaying their deprivation puts more serious-minded indies to shame.

TWITTER Thereas a vaguely Spielbergian quality to British writer-director Joe Cornishas skill at balancing his young heroes sense of shared adventure with genuine danger. NEW YORK - In Hollywood teens-in-peril movies the protagonists - aside from a token nerd or two -- usually have flawlessly sculpted noses great hair toned gym bodies and excellent teeth. Their most reprehensible behavior might be skipping class or talking back to a parent. One of the many delights of the fast and funny Brit alternative Attack the Block is that the ragtag inner-city gang besieged by hostile aliens are junior thugs from the projects which makes their redemption all the more winning. The ripe remake potential here is a no-brainer but the unassuming charms of this Screen Gems pickup with its irresistible blend of the rough-edged with the slick give Attack the Block a shot at attracting some culty attention on its own merits. A popular TV and radio comic in the U.K. writer-director Joe Cornish is a co-scripter on Steven Spielbergs year-end release The Adventures of Tintin The Secret of the Unicorn and the forthcoming Marvel feature Ant-Man. On both those projects he works with Edgar Wright who figures here as executive producer. Wrights British features Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz tweak their respective genres (zombie flicks and cop action movies) with humor. By contrast Cornishs debut sticks to his chosen formula while freshening it with a specific urban identity localized slang and scrappy but likable anti-heroes whose attitude outweighs their smarts. Pedal-to-the-metal pacing doesnt hurt either. The setting is a South London hood where the action unfolds over a single night. The racially mixed gang led by surly 15-year-old Moses (John Boyega) is first seen on the street relieving Sam (Jodie Whittaker) a young nurse of her cash phone and jewelry at knife-point. Its Guy Fawkes Night so a meteor-like projectile careening toward them just looks like more fireworks until it crashes through the roof of a parked car. Checking the wrecked auto for valuables Moses gets a nasty scratch from a creature lurking inside. All tough-guy bravado he chases the thing up a dark hillside to kill it. Bad idea. He stashes the unidentifiable carcass in the apartment of permanently baked weed dealer Ron (Nick Frost) where educated stoner Brewis (Luke Treadaway) verifies that its no species he ever encountered in zoology studies. But while they contemplate what it might fetch on eBay dozens more aliens come raining down. Jet-black furballs that bound along like apes on all fours their chomping jaws full of glow-in-the-dark razor teeth (think faceless Critters that sprint rather than roll) these invaders smell pheromones and are hell-bent on payback. The heavy accents and local vernacular take some getting used to but nothing crucial is lost. Cornish juices the dialogue with lots of deadpan humor without undermining the menace or suspense by making his well-drawn characters too knowing. These are kids who have learned to rely on their wits and to distrust any authority but their own so its natural they would take charge. Their meager finances are amusingly acknowledged in their collective lack of cell-phone credit ""This is too much madness to explain in one text"" Cornish deftly folds the diverse characters together as allies and weeds out the foes. When Pest (Alex Esmail) a white kid who overcompensates by laying on the ghetto-speak gets bitten Sam is forced to help the group that mugged her earlier. But she soon needs their protection and a mutual respect shyly blooms. Drug kingpin Hi-Hatz (Jumayn Hunter) initially recruits Moses who seems ready to graduate to the big leagues but he turns on the gang after misreading a messy situation. Theres also spirited interplay between the boys and their female counterparts led by feisty Tia (Danielle Vitalis) who roll their eyes at the clueless guys propensity to get into trouble. The girls hold their own in the alien combat at one point memorably employing an ice skate blade as a lethal weapon. The most disarming plot thread involves two 9-year-old tykes shut out of the big-kid action. Determined to earn their street cred they insist on being called Probs (Sammy Williams) and Mayhem (Michael Ajao) stepping in when Biggz (Simon Howard) and his fro are trapped in a dumpster under alien attack. The mostly young cast is uniformly appealing while more seasoned hand Frost adds droll notes. Theres a vaguely Spielbergian quality to Cornishs skill at balancing the sense of shared adventure with genuine danger. The writer-director provides plenty of scares and nail-biting narrow escapes (plus the occasional bloody casualty) while also nurturing distinct personalities for his motley crew. Theres a terrific efficiency to a scene in which they dash back to their respective apartments to arm themselves - among other things with baseball bats ornamental samurai swords firecrackers and kitchen knives. The briefest exchanges with their parental figures show that beneath the hoodies and badass posturing these really are still ordinary teenagers. Cornish nudges along rather than belabors the rite-of-passage elements so that when Moses assumes responsibility for his actions and reveals true leadership skills it pays off as a satisfying character development and not a contrived arc. While the creatures look like vicious Muppets they make surprisingly convincing antagonists. Visual effects overall on what no doubt was a limited budget by most standards are sharp enough. Where the movie really scores is in the muscular physicality of Thomas Townends widescreen cinematography the speedy rhythms of Jonathan Amos editing and the propulsive dynamic of Steven Prices techno score which incorporates driving beats from house music duo Felix Burton and Simon Ratcliffe of Basement Jaxx.

This year the lineup for the 11-day event (which returns June 16-26 to L.A. Live and the surrounding downtown neighborhood) does have a handful of Cannes Sundance SXSW and Toronto pedigreed titles in the mix but theres also a wealth of world and U.S. premieres particularly in the narrative and documentary competitions.LAFFs biggest ""get"" in terms of a world premiere from a name filmmaker Richard Linklaters opening-night selection Bernie was not screened for us before the festival; what follows is our guide to 30-something films that we were able to preview. In next weeks Film section well take a closer look at a few highlights from the festivals second weekend. --Karina LongworthReviews are by Phil Coldiron Doug Cummings Ernest Hardy Aaron Hillis Sarah LaBrie Karina Longworth and Michael Nordine. For screening locations and times go to lafilmfest.com.108 Attempting to unravel the secrets around her uncles mysterious death and even more mysterious life documentarian Renate Costa finds herself plunged into the hidden history of Paraguays queer community including the intense brutality it suffered under dictator Alfredo Stroessner. Its less a matter of official obfuscation however than that of familial homophobia that shrouds her uncles brief painful life. Costa is tenacious but also repetitive; her badgering of her father especially is pointless to the audience long before it is to her. And though she clearly means well her own views on the queer struggle can be incredibly naive. Still as a window into Paraguays not-so-distant past -- with her familys tale serving as a microcosm of the larger arch toward LGBT visibility and equality -- 108 is a useful thread in the global conversation about queerness.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm A BETTER LIFE Carlos Galindo the undocumented Mexican father whos half this movies center (his surly teen son being the other) is trying hard not only to support his boy materially but to show by example that hardship doesnt have to rob you of compassion or basic human decency. In the hands of director Chris Weitz and screenwriter Eric Eason that means the father edges close to sainthood in stark contrast to L.A. gang culture pulling at his son in school and on street corners. In arguing their case for tolerance and understanding of the immigrant struggle they even extend saintly sheen to the fellow immigrant whose betrayal sets tragedy in motion. What makes the film worthwhile is the beautifully examined dynamic of the complex father-son relationship. By the tearjerker ending you wont quibble about the films minor flaws. (E.H.)AN ORDINARY FAMILY An Ordinary Family is one of those well-meaning films whose core politics are laudably progressive but whose execution is flat and unsophisticated. When Seth shows up at a family gathering with his (kind of obnoxious) boyfriend his older brother Thomas -- a man of the cloth -- struggles to reconcile religion-based homophobia with his love for his queer brother. Over the course of several days the siblings and their extended family are put through paces that juxtapose sugary family outings with teary confrontations. None of it really goes beyond surface-deep psychological examination however and from the faux-ribald comments of the women in a ""girls only"" sit-down to the final emotional showdown between Seth and Thomas the dialogue is largely boilerplate. (E.H.)THE ARCANE ENCHANTER Its easy to guess one reason why LAFF guest director Guillermo del Toro -- who offers an exuberant commentary on the U.K. DVD of Carl Dreyers classic Vampyr -- might be excited about presenting Pupi Avatis 1994 horror film unreleased in the U.S. Its slow-burning gothic setup about a defrocked priest residing in a rustic castle is filmed in unusually strong atmospheric terms; every sky is stained with ominous clouds and each passing character oozes subterfuge. Avati has a gift for portentous visuals but the film loses considerable steam when it slowly becomes clear that creaky doors and indigo twilights are pretty much the main act. The plot invokes conspiracies and the occult but the ideas never fully materialize the protagonist is kept at an emotional distance and the central ""mystery"" is obvious long before the movie ends. What might have been commendable restraint ultimately feels like undernourished ambition. (D.C.)GO  ATTACK THE BLOCK Unlike Shaun of the Dead and the other cheekily self-aware genre mash-ups of Edgar Wright (who serves here as an executive producer) writer-director Joe Cornishs charmingly zippy debut -- a funny-scary thriller about an alien invasion within a South London council tower block -- wants to be taken seriously while evoking a childlike sense of marvel or at least early-blockbuster nostalgia. (Is this the inner-city companion to Super 8?) Wryly wisecracking in a sometimes hard-to-follow Brit vernacular a racially mixed rabble of teen delinquents redeem themselves with the nurse theyve previously mugged after intergalactic beasties with glow-in-the-dark chompers come crashing down like meteorites. Classes races and morally opposing forces must unite to survive but the Ealingesque social satire gets forgivably whitewashed by all the techno-thumpin frights and fantastic action. (A.H.) THE BAD INTENTIONS Set in Peru in 1982 with the Shining Path socialist terror wave a distant backdrop The Bad Intentions focuses on Cayetana a sweet-faced 9-year-old schemer often left to her own imaginative destructive devices by her globe-trotting pill-popping mom and estranged womanizer dad. Morbid and cynical Cayetana learns her mom is having a baby with her new husband (whose glass business booming thanks to civil unrest keeps them all in a lavish lifestyle) and becomes convinced shes going to die. Theres a lot of tired Sundance-style quirk here -- bad parenting is played for laughs Cayetanas precocity is meant to be adorable even as it borders on sociopathy -- but by presenting a world in turmoil through the oblique perspective of her child protagonist director Rosario Garcia-Montero manages to evoke the look and feel of bourgeois solipsism in the face of social struggle. (K.L.)CHEONGGYECHEON MEDLEY A DREAM OF IRON Kelvin Kyung Kun Parks nonfiction hybrid is part dream journal part post-Chris Marker video letter to Parks late ironworker grandfather part fly-on-the-wall document of the vestiges of the old-school scrap-metal industry still hanging on in Cheonggyecheon a rapidly gentrifying district in Seoul. The verite material of life and work in contemporary small-scale foundries is intimate casual and not terribly revelatory. Much more exciting are the many experimental purely formal sequences in which Park sets his own personal musings to highly manipulated nearly hallucinatory footage of machinery in motion. (K.L.)CRITICS PICK  CURLING In Curling a young girl (Philomene Bilodeau giving a fascinatingly blank performance) stumbles upon a tiger and a pile of frozen dead bodies in the woods; her father (Philomenes father Emmanuel Bilodeau) finds a dead child on the side of the road lusts after a goth girl while wearing a bowling pin costume and sleeps with a hooker; the world is one of imposingly huge vistas or impenetrably shallow focus. Director Denis Cotes best feature to date looks on the surface like a string of discrete incidents that may or may not add up to anything. As the credits roll over yet another image with no obvious relation to what came before it a form gradually comes into focus Curling like the highly strategic game from which it takes its name is a film of connections and reactions one where the meaning of each shot is dependent upon its place in the whole. (P.C.)THE DYNAMITER A beautifully lensed coming-of-age tale set in rural Mississippi The Dynamiter stars newcomer William Ruffin as Robbie a 14-year-old struggling to finish junior high and keep some kind of family life intact despite the fact that his mom has all but left him and his younger half-brother to fend for themselves. The film is at its best as a character study of this realistically conflicted teen who will resort to all manner of hardscrabble methods to get by but obviously longs for a ""normal"" teenage life. Ruffin is the most compelling member of a cast composed primarily of apparent nonactors many of whom are laughably stilted. (K.L.)ENTRANCE Directors Dallas Hallam and Patrick Horvath take their time telling the story of beautiful hipster barista Suizey (played by actual beautiful hipster barista Suizey Block her Elvira haircut perma-perfect even at the characters most agitated) whose increasing loneliness and isolation in a cold dark Silver Lake hilltop house builds until she impulsively decides to move -- an out plan foiled when a creepazoid crashes her going-away bash. That this film exists is evidence of the rising influence of indie horror star Ti West (writer-director of LAFF 06s Trigger Man and LAFF 11 selection The Innkeepers reviewed below) who pretty much invented the subgenre of slow-burn studies of hot cool 20-somethings who learn very late in the game that their paranoia is totally justified. But Hallam and Horvath cant pull off the transition from long ""is anything actually happening here?"" buildup to genuine horror. Their bloodbath climax is unintentionally funny and not at all creepy. (K.L.)GO  ETERNITY Director Sivaroj Kongsakul doesnt skimp on the long takes nonprofessional performances and elliptical narrative that weve come to expect from films bearing the stamp of the Rotterdam Film Festival -- but for its first 10 minutes Eternity looks like it might be something truly different. It begins with a sort of rural Thai Brown Bunny routine Across a handful of shots a man drives around on a motorcycle with no apparent destination at one point entering and exiting a single shot half a dozen times. Soon enough the oblique metaphysical love story kicks in (the motorcyclist is a ghost and the bulk of the film recounts his youthful romance) and Kongsakul nudges it along in a gentle underplayed style. (P.C.) FAMILIAR GROUND Writer-director Stephane Lafleurs incredibly droll look at one familys multipronged slow-boil domestic despair (a marriage dying from inertia; a scorching decades-old sibling rivalry; a fathers unshielded and frequently verbalized disappointment in his son; male self-hate that firebombs everything around it) is measured but far from boring. The films paced dissection of spiritual malaise is smart sympathetic and at times laugh-out-loud funny. With a wintry Canadian landscape as its backdrop (an ironic metaphor for characters whose surface lives often appear chilled even as they quietly roil inside) the film has a hypnotic quality that pulls you in as layers of its characters lives are subtly peeled back in scenarios ranging from disastrous family dinners to a road trip with unexpected consequences. The cast is note-perfect as is the surprise ending. (E.H.)CRITICS PICK  FAMILY INSTINCT An hourlong slice-of-fucked-up-life portrait of Zanda a penniless mother raising two kids alone in rural Latvia. Her baby daddy is in prison and shes responsible for putting him there -- after a fight she impulsively revealed to the community that her common-law husband is also her brother. As Zanda nervously waits for her lover/brother to finish his sentence she receives a constant stream of visitors -- mostly male all destitute crazy-eyed and grotesquely drunk -- and mulls over whether to change her life. Director Andris Gauja clearly had fly-on-the-wall access to his not-all-there subjects but some scenes shot from multiple angles are so formally composed as to seem staged. Thats not a bad thing In all of this desperation and depravity Gauja rescues a narrative of deep sadness and yearning thats as touching as the circumstances are shocking. Splitting the difference between the work of the Dardennes brothers and Harmony Korine Family Instinct is the must-see WTF?? title of the festival. (K.L.)CRITICS PICK  FAMILY PORTRAIT IN BLACK AND WHITE Theres nothing ""post-racial"" about the Ukraine depicted in Julia Ivanovas documentary about single middle-aged white Ukranian mom Olga Nenya whose brood of 27 kids includes 20 foster kids most of whom are the biracial children of white Ukrainian women and African immigrants. With a population thats overwhelmingly white within which is a thriving skinhead community theres still huge social stigma in Ukraine around racial intermingling and the children that result. Ivanova painstakingly captures the turbulence within and without Olgas loving but iron-fist-ruled household and as the film moves through time with normal teen rebellion spiked by questions and issues of identity both Olgas motives and affections become murkier. One of her foster sons labels her ""Stalin"" and the film illustrates that while hes not simply indulging teen hyperbole  he is somewhat simplifying truth. That Ivanova resists such simplification -- painting Olga as neither saint nor villain -- makes this Family Portrait riveting. (E.H.)THE FATHERLESS First-time auteur Marie Kreutzers cinematic proof of the Tolstoyan notion that every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way The Fatherless charts the slow-moving torrent of emotions -- few of them cathartic -- released by the death of the emotionally distant patriarch of a former hippie commune in rural Austria. The film is more a portrait of the living (including the mans son and two daughters) than an elegy for the dead. Kreutzer favors small moments over sweeping gestures silence blurred faces sun-kissed flashbacks of the man and his many adopted and biological children abound. Kreutzer is attuned to the now-adult childrens idiosyncrasies but this strange crest of family secrets and lies is so stately that whats meant to be revelatory sometimes fails to engage. (M.N.)HABANA EVA Imagine Drew Barrymore at her most insufferably cute -- twinkling and mugging for the camera -- and multiply it by 10 and you have an idea of Prakriti Maduros performance as Eva a poor seamstress in contemporary Cuba who has to choose between the wealthy Venezuelan tourist who woos her and the longtime boyfriend whos loyal but lazy. Writer-director Fina Torres (who penned the screenplay with Jorge Luis Camacho) tries to give his Cinderella-tinged romcom heft by injecting a voice-over about the dire living conditions of most Cubans and including lots of admittedly gorgeous shots of dilapidated buildings and vintage cars (best part of the film). But neither those devices nor the ghost of a ribald hooker can offset the saccharine and shameless emotional manipulation. And the ending of faux female empowerment rings extraordinarily hollow. (E.H.)HOW TO CHEAT Theres a wonderful brunch scene in How to Cheat in which a couple secretly struggling to conceive a child endure the comments of friends who are pushing them to have a baby the friends oblivious to the discomfort being caused. Writer-director Amber Sealy (who also stars as Beth the female half of the struggling couple) has filled her film with such painful all-too-real moments. Cheat charts a troubled marriage whose fractures are widened by a host of issues -- childlessness shitty jobs a general sense that the spouses are just ill-suited for one another. Its not groundbreaking stuff but the ample time spent on the husbands pain and frustration -- especially his bumbling then life-altering efforts to have an affair -- creates an unexpectedly complex portrait of an ordinary often annoying man trying to avoid being crushed by the upheavals in his ordinary life. (E.H.) THE INNKEEPERS Its the last weekend of operation at a creaky old New England inn and slacker front-desk workers Luke (Pat Healy) and Claire (Sara Paxton) are determined to capture evidence of the ghost that reputedly haunts the halls. Distinguished by low-key character comedy (Claire a well-intentioned goober for whom the surly Luke quietly pines) Ti Wests latest lacks the aesthetic precision of his last effort The House of the Devil -- and being that theyre both haunted-house movies the comparison is unavoidable. But even when West isnt at his best nobody else does this kind of slow-mounting supernatural spooker better. (K.L.)LEAVE IT ON THE FLOOR Theres much to like in Sheldon Larry and Glenn Gaylords musical some wonderfully bitchy one-liners musical numbers that only just miss their mark but are still largely enjoyable (especially the Stevie Wonder-inflected show tunes) the chance to see L.A. ball culture repped on-screen (with black gay folk taking care of one another) and some amazing eye candy. But much of the exposition-heavy dialogue looks right through the characters to ""explain"" the milieu (lingo politics) to outsiders; references and influences (Rent Dreamgirls Paris Is Burning) are leaned on too heavily; the ending is so determined to send viewers out of the theater feeling good that conflicts are too quickly (even bafflingly) resolved with a tragedy that was earlier used to milk tears completely erased. This should be a hoot to watch with a crowd but it doesnt hold up to close scrutiny. (E.H.)LOVE CRIME Alain Corneaus Serie Noire one of the great French crime films was adapted from Jim Thompsons A Hell of a Woman by novelist Georges Perec who rendered its dialogue almost entirely in hard-boiled cliches. Three decades later in his final film (he passed away last August at the age of 67) Corneau transmutes the banalities of Perecs script into the set design for Love Crime which for its first hour at least looks like it was shot in a showroom at the local Ethan Allen. Corneau uses these soulless spaces to mirror the power struggle between an icy Kristin Scott Thomas and Ludivine Sagnier (doing her best Chloe Sevigny) potential lovers and competing ladder-climbers at a multinational corporation. A sudden act of violence breaks the movie in two and what follows pares away Corneaus materialist interest while unpacking the slyness of the plotting that had preceded it in order to set up a bitterly sentimental final twist. (P.C.)MAMITAS At one point in Mamitas Echo Park bad boy Jordin (E.J. Bonilla) confesses that hes drawn to bookish Felipa (Veronica Diaz-Carranza) because with her he doesnt have to act like the swaggering asshole everyone else expects. The strength of writer-director Nicholas Ozekis coming-of-age romance is that he strikes a wonderful balance between ""performed"" expected representations of Latino culture and shrewd dismantling of the same. Jordin comes from a troubled family whose secret-laden past shadows them. Felipa a New Yorker living with L.A. relatives because of her own family troubles is the polar opposite of the girls Jordin normally chases. Their initial connection is a little contrived and the films ending is rushed but between those bookends is a sweet exploration of young love against a backdrop of complex family dynamics. Though the writing and pacing could be tighter Bonilla and Diaz-Carranza have fantastic chemistry. (E.H.)CRITICS PICK  MYSTERIES OF LISBON Filmmaker Raul Ruiz adapts Camilo Brancos 19th-century Romantic novel and turns it into the kind of utterly absorbing masterwork one might expect from the director of such intricate and playful films as Hypothesis of the Stolen Painting Three Lives and Only One Death and Time Regained (not to mention more than 100 other titles in the last half-century). The grand narrative -- which bears comparison to the works of Victor Hugo -- emanates from an orphan seeking his identity and expands forward and backward in time through the boys relations in the Portuguese aristocracy. Originally a six-hour miniseries this roughly four-hour theatrical cut entrances with elaborate costumes candlelit interiors and arresting landscapes. But unlike typical period dramas it boasts a sly self-consciousness (distortions exaggerated close-ups and unexpected tracking shots) that emphasizes its artifice. This is a filmmaker who relishes the telling of tales and his enthusiasm is felt in every frame. (D.C.) NATURAL SELECTION The inexplicable winner of multiple prizes at this years SXSW stars comedian Rachael Harris as Linda a housewife whose devout Christian husband wont have sex with her because shes infertile. When hubby has a stroke Linda discovers his secret life and hits the road to track down his 23-year-old illegitimate son a hot loser who is happy to accompany Linda back to meet his dad if it helps him evade the fuzz. This dramedy of an odd couple using the road as a safe space in which to court via the swapping of life stories/life lessons is all post-Sundance cliche. Its not a movie about people living lives but a movie about collections of quirks moving through situations. (K.L.)CRITICS PICK  ONCE I WAS A CHAMPION An unexpectedly moving look at the short life of Ultimate Fighting Championship star Evan Tanner Gerard Roxburghs documentary manages to celebrate its subject without ever slipping into hagiography. Filled with interview and fight footage of Tanner as well as talking heads powerfully sketching in his life (often moved to tears while doing so) the film maps Tanners troubled youth unpredictable and self-sabotaging career choices battle with alcoholism and the ongoing mystery of his death -- was it a suicide? The portrait that emerges is that of a very troubled but deeply spiritual man of surprising intellectual prowess who saw his life as a soul journey with the mandate to treat everyone he met with kindness and respect. This may well be one of the most inspiring and heartbreaking films in the festival. (E.H.) CRITICS PICK  PAPER SOLDIER One of the most thought-provoking and visually sumptuous films to yet emerge from post-Soviet Russia Alexey German Jr.s meditation on the life of individuals caught up in the early-60s cosmonaut program is at once a tribute to the past and a commentary on the present. Idealistic doctor Danya (played by the brooding Merab Ninidze) must choose the first person to undergo a space launch a utopian project that increasingly threatens human cost. The film powerfully extrapolates Danyas internal bifurcation by emphasizing his romantic indecision his dislocation in the barren Kazakh prairies of the launch site (where a Stalinist gulag is in the process of being dismantled) and the Chekhovian farcical conversations that continually dance around the dread. Its a tribute to a generation of intellectuals and a country in transition etched with astonishing long takes that echo the work of Tarkovsky and other Soviet and Eastern European filmmakers of the era. (D.C.)GO  PARAISO FOR SALE The huge numbers of Americans and Canadians (mostly retirees) setting up shop in Latin American countries (where the dollar goes further and where gorgeous landscapes can be bought for a song) has been well covered in the media. Director Anayansi Prado takes her camera to Panama to capture how the new immigrants bringing wealth arrogance and the determination to turn paradise into a grotesque resort are literally and metaphorically bulldozing indigenous citizens. Its a captivating and infuriating film a real-life horror flick as we watch smug American developers maneuver the law and taint local politics to achieve their goals. Its inspiring to see countless Panamanian would-be Davids standing up to assorted gringo Goliaths but the slow-growing pessimism and cynicism of native citizens in the face of a clearly rigged system are depressing to witness. (E.H.) GO  PLEASE DO NOT DISTURB This short verite-style narrative feature directed by Mohsen Abdolvahab consists of three loosely connected stories unfolding on a single day in contemporary Tehran. A game-show host tries to prevent his wife from going public about his domestic abuse; a cleric fields calls from the thief who stole his wallet; and an elderly couple attempt to prevent a suspicious repairman from entering their home. The tone throughout these public/private negotiations is unexpectedly neurotic-comic (the husbands defensive ""jokes"" about the history of wife beating feel like a bizarro-world Larry David rationalization routine) which allows Abdolvahab to breeze through a variety of Big Social Issues without lecturing or coming off as heavy-handed. (K.L.)CRITICS PICK  POSITION AMONG THE STARS You dont need to have seen 2001s The Eye of the Day or 2005s Shape of the Moon to be moved and awed by the final leg in Dutch filmmaker Leonard Retel Helmrichs warmhearted doc trilogy involving the Sjamsuddin family from the chaotic slums of Jakarta. Rather than another weepy lament over the anesthetizing effects of Third World poverty this patient but wildly expressionistic mosaic uses a canvas so vast that not just the subjects but fighting fish cockroaches and the mangiest rat yet committed to cinema complete a bizarre ecosystem of co-dependence. There are no talking heads or voice-over just acrobatic verite camera work allowing the rapidly changing details of this post-globalized society to be mirrored in the day-in-the-life toils of middle-aged slacker Bakti his ball-busting Christian mother Rumidjah and his mildly Westernized young niece Tari. (A.H.) THE PRUITT-IGOE MYTH Directed by Chad Friedrichs this documentary painstakingly illustrates how racism classism and government agencies -- all in the service of big business -- shaped the horrors of St. Louis notorious Pruitt-Igoe housing project demolished in 1972 after being allowed to slide from a state-of-the-art planned community to a hellhole of violence and despair. Nothing revealed in the film is really news though seeing it all carefully laid out on-screen by talking heads (social scientists journalists former residents of Pruitt-Igoe) is maddening while old news and stock footage of the project is riveting. Given the ongoing shredding of the social safety net in America the films greatest service might be to remind us that programs and services for the poor have always had hostile enemies and the assaults taking place now are nothing new. (E.H.)SALAAM DUNK Basketball is an escape -- from regressive gender roles and daily life in a nation torn from within and occupied by outsiders -- in Salaam Dunk David Fines documentary chronicling a year in the life of the womens basketball team at the American University of Iraq Sulaimani. Though the subject is ripe for sentimental affectation Fines approach is commendably evenhanded. His focus is more on the inexperienced but determined young women at AUI-S than on the war-torn milieu that surrounds them. Having lived through displacement and tragedy they treat the basketball court not as another battle zone but rather as a place of fellowship and unity. Theyre genuine exemplars of strength wrought by hardship. (M.N.)GO  SAWDUST CITY Written directed by and starring David Nordstrom (lead of LAFF 05 title Trona) Sawdust City begins with a gracefully ingenious montage soundtracked by a phone call between Bob (Nordstrom) and his brother Pete (Carl McLaughlin) establishing their relationship and situation Bobs married and stuck in the dying lumber town in which they grew up Petes a drifter currently in the military theyre estranged its Thanksgiving Petes in town for one night and he wants to see their alcoholic father. The brothers hop bars all day and night slowly dropping their masculine fronts and revealing long-buried resentments. Nordstrom demonstrates an uncanny feel for the shape and architecture of drunken misadventure with James Laxtons digital cinematography carving a tangible mood out of smoke steam and snow. But because the narrative premise is an obvious MacGuffin theres nowhere for this to build but to a blowout marked by disappointingly generic dialogue (""I was running away from you"" ""You were running away from yourself""). Sawdust City is just good enough that you wish it were better. (K.L.)SELF MADE In British artist Gillian Wearings experimental docu-stunt a group of non-thespians are put through a crash course in Method acting with the goal of translating their traumatic personal histories into staged short films within the film. The process -- the intense workshopping the participants go through alone and as a group to learn how to first access and then express their memories -- is more interesting than the end product. One player after acting out a dramatization of his worst fear sums up my feelings about the short films exactly ""I was hoping it would be metaphorical rather than explicit. But it just turned into explicit."" But the tension that runs throughout between ""real"" and performed recorded and created is compelling particularly if you think of Self Made as a companion to that other recent British performative documentary puzzle The Arbor. (K.L.)SENNA Asif Kapadias documentary on the life career and death of Brazilian Formula One race car driver Ayrton Senna is composed entirely of archival footage -- from TV broadcasts home movies and most powerfully the flickering feeds captured by helmet cams which put the viewer in Sennas seat for a number of races including the one that killed him. Audio interviews with racing experts and Senna intimates are laid on top of a pulsing electro score but they fall a bit short in providing context While illustrating in depth the racers complicated relationship with the sports governing body and his rivals the film fails to make a case for why Sennas story has any larger relevance outside the world of Formula One. But theres no denying the visceral impact of its best sequences particularly the harrowing climax. (K.L.)SEX CRIMES UNIT In many ways Sex Crimes Unit is just a couple of real-life Law amp; Order SVU episodes mixed together. But this documentary about the formation and day-to-day challenges of New Yorks sex crimes unit is so engrossing that its surface familiarity is not an issue. Particularly illuminating are the talking heads who outline the history of the unit and the countless ways it has been at the forefront of changing laws and cultural attitudes (viewers are reminded -- or newly informed -- that as recently as 20 years ago marital rape was not a crime and acquaintance rapes werent prosecuted almost everywhere in America). Both behind-the-scenes strategizing and courtroom footage of real-life cases unfold before the camera illustrating just whats at stake for this office and the victims it represents. (E.H.) TYRANNOSAUR Written and directed by actor Paddy Considine Tyrannosaur traverses well-trod territory -- a damaged old crank brought to redemption by an angelic female savior -- without offering much in the way of invention. Peter Mullan plays Joseph an elderly vandal who kicks his own dog to death. Hannah (Olivia Colman) is the religious shop owner who prays for his soul while fighting to escape her monstrous husband (Eddie Marsan). A color palette inspired by the low-hanging Leeds sky enhances a lingering sense of doom. Virtually hopeless and brutal for brutalitys sake the film does feature multifaceted performances by Mullan and Colman and careful direction by Considine all of whom won prizes at Sundance for their work. (S.L.)GO  UNFINISHED SPACES In 1961 Fidel Castro asked three architects to design a complex of buildings to house Cubas new National Art Schools. Inspired by the feeling of freedom in the air the chosen designers set out to create structures that would embody the utopian ethics of the revolution. And then the ethics of the revolution changed and construction was halted indefinitely. The unfinished buildings still stand a reminder of the lost promise of the 60s and of how the ideals that fueled that era soured once given practical application. Composed primarily of archival footage and candid interviews with the now-aged architects Spaces gets flabby as it goes on but its still a fascinating example of a nations evolution told through the life of a single art project. (K.L.)UNRAVELED In 2009 attorney Marc Dreier admitted to forgeries that netted his law firm more than 750 million. Directed by former Dreier employee Marc Simon Unraveled investigates the strange mix of hubris and low self-esteem that drives people with enormous amounts of money to do incredibly stupid things. Under house arrest in his Manhattan apartment Dreier narrates his own rise and fall through interviews interspersed with graphic-novel-style re-enactments of his crimes an odd directorial choice that verges on distracting. Simons stated goal is for audiences to understand Dreier on his own terms so Dreier his son and his lawyers constitute the films entire cast. The absence of input from others involved and a lack of compelling visual footage detract from this otherwise mesmerizing glimpse inside the mind of a white-collar thief. (S.L.)WISH ME AWAY This confessional documentary looks at the country music world from a new angle the closet. Directors Bobbie Berleffi and Beverly Kopf relay Chely Wrights long painful process of coming out as the first openly gay country singer and subsequently going from mainstay of the Nashville-centric scene to pariah. Archival footage of Wrights public life is backed with intimate voice-over in which she recalls private agonies the dissolution of relationships acts of deflection and repression and a near-suicide attempt with a loaded gun. Betraying a need to be liked that hasnt left her even as shes gained a renewed sense of self the image Wright leaves is of a woman tiptoeing in and out of the spotlight hoping to reconcile her star persona with her true self. (M.N.)GO  WHERE SOLDIERS COME FROM They come from lower-class families in rural northern Michigan or so illustrates Heather Courtneys eye-opening and riveting four-years-in-the-making doc portrait of childhood friends who decide to join the National Guard after high school to escape dead-end futures. The pragmatic belief is that college tuition and signing bonuses are worth deployment to Afghanistan but Courtney avoids the maddening obviousness of that bitter socioeconomic truth through humanity and understatement. We candidly see how the battlefields wear down these wartime neophytes into apathetic even misanthropic shells of their former selves; the relatable emotional shades from their nervous families also are colored in. Never heavy-handed intrusively stylized or wagging its finger at foreign-policy hypocrisies weve all heard before the films greatest heartbreak is showing how the only way for some to survive on the home front is to continually risk permanent injury overseas.

Attack the Block bathed in techno and rap long on laughs and attitude and boldly innovative while still flashily acknowledging those that have come before -- this is a movie that should (and deserves to) foster a cult audience. We need more films in the spirit of Attack the Block movies unafraid to blend genre made on the (relative) cheap and with characters you can relate to. An absolutely excellent time. So whats it all about? South London the dodgy part where youre liable to get yourself mugged if youre out late at night. Which is precisely what happens to a young nursing student named Sam (Jodie Whittaker). Shes accosted by five youths for her purse cell phone and jewelry. But something happens while shes being robbed BOOM a huge meteor-like object crushes a car thats right beside the thieves and their victim. Everyone scatters to the wind though Sam is too frightened of the muggers to take note of the larger events unfolding events portended by the destroyed automobile. What we have here is an alien invasion though of the localized variety. No shots of CNN no marshaling of the worlds resources just the kids of urban London battling against whatever the hell is landing on Earth chasing them. An intimate alien film? Absolutely. Clever eh? Sadly to get too deeply into the specifics would be a disservice so lets instead focus on the superior attitude and execution that is Attack the Block. Theres no wasted motion as the boys begin to equip themselves for war. In some ways their attitude is informed by a couple decades of invasion films and they dont blink as they get strapped and make mutual ""got your back"" winks and nods. The leader of the young gang is Moses (John Boyega) hes poised and lethally effective and the four other boys would clearly go to the wall for him. The boys attempt to leverage the contacts they have which of course include drug dealers and drug users all in an effort to deal with the issue at hand. Nick Frost plays one of those user/dealers he brings his patented ""Hmmm I am confused by the events transpiring"" cluelessness to the action and of course this is used for maximum levity. Go to the police? Ha These boys are rousted by police on the regular for their mere appearance they trust the police even less than they trust whatever it is thats attacking their little corner of London. No the official routes are off-limits theyve been raised to handle their own business. This is London lawlessness versus alien savagery no prisoners no mercy. Where Attack the Block excels is in the areas of music and technology. And techno music appropriately enough. The film makes excellent use of KRS-1s ""Sound of da police"" and theres a moment where all the boys have used up their mobile service allotment (remember these are rough and tumble inner-city kids not remotely approaching middle class) and one of the fellas exclaims ""This is way too much information to put into only one text"" Its moments like this that show Attack the Blocks cultural vitality this is a movie that is attuned to a realistic portrayal of how a cataclysm might look through the eyes of Englands youth. The one failing Attack the Block must be dinged for is its stubborn refusal to let events dictate tone. There are heart-wrenching scenes here but Attack the Block refuses to admit the emotional toll opting instead to keep a relentless foot on the plot accelerator. Its a reasonable choice as its as much a comedy as it is a sci-fi invasion story but the lack of introspection keeps the movie from taking its rightful place at the very top of the genre. Still thats a paltry complaint and shouldnt detract from the overall ""fun"" level of the work as a whole. Part Warriors part Goonies but all heart Attack the Block is wildly entertaining a must see for any fan of ""us vs. them"" cinema.

Brit comedian-TV presenter Joe Cornish emerges fully formed as an exciting new writer-helmer with his enormously appealing debut feature ""Attack the Block."" Pitched as ""inner city vs. outer space"" pic sees a quintet of teen street hoodlums defend their tower-block home in the projects from an invasion of shaggy-haired aliens with Day-Glo teeth. Set over one wild night in South London this zero-to-hero tale will play gangbusters in its native Blighty before a rich ancillary career. Authentic Brit teen slang may render ""Block"" a puzzling lifeform for foreign auds but pockets of receptive fans across the planet are a given. The first greenlit screenplay from the well-connected Cornish was Steven Spielbergs upcoming ""The Adventures of Tintin The Secret of the Unicorn"" co-scripted with Edgar Wright (exec producer here) and Steven Moffat. However since the big-budget Herge adaptation is still in production Cornishs own directorial effort is being released first. The talent on display in ""Attack the Block"" more than justifies Spielberg and Wrights faith in the novice scribe previously best known to U.K. auds for TVs ""The Adam and Joe Show"" and its radio spinoff. Story begins with racially diverse teen protags Moses (John Boyega) Pest (Alex Esmail) Dennis (Franz Drameh) Jerome (Leeon Jones) and Biggz (Simon Howard) relieving nurse Sam (Jodie Whittaker) of her cellphone purse and ring at knife-point. Next an alien falls from the sky crashing through the roof of a parked car. The extraterrestrial incident provokes little interest from authorities since the sky is already lit up by fireworks celebrating Britains Bonfire Night but the boys chase and kill the intruder then cart their booty to benign cannabis cultivator Ron (Nick Frost) for advice on how to monetize the find. Cornish is mostly well served by his youthful lead actors especially Boyega as ringleader Moses whos granted the most complete character arc as he comes to accept responsibility for impetuous actions that precipitate a full-on alien invasion. Likable supporting characters abound including the boys skeptical female friends and two young urchins who want in on the action. Even the potentially cliched role of trust-fund stoner Brewis an outsider caught up in the mayhem is nicely elevated thanks to witty dialogue delivered by Luke Treadaway. Most obvious point of comparison is Wrights 2004 zombie comedy ""Shaun of the Dead"" (in which Cornish had an uncredited cameo) with its mix of wry humor and genre homage. Pic also reps a natural evolution from a popular ""Adam and Joe Show"" segment in which classic or recent movies were re-enacted with stuffed toys. In ""Attack the Block"" the fantasy-adventure spoof is instead populated by kids who are evidently a product of their tough environment. The boys earn sympathy when they make up with Sam stand up to violent criminal Hi-Hatz (Jumayn Hunter) and save the day paying dearly in some cases. Thanks to nimble pacing the boys excitement should prove effectively contagious. While the films use of the voguish teen lexicon will add to its appeal domestically flummoxed non-native auds wont miss any important plot points and subtitling or dubbing should cover the cracks in foreign-lingo outposts. Propulsive score by Steven Price with Felix Buxton and Simon Ratcliffe of dance-music duo Basement Jaxx adds another jolt of energy while lenser Tom Townend (who shot Samantha Mortons ""The Unloved"") makes savvy use of the nighttime housing-project setting exploiting street lamps interior strip lighting fireworks and the aliens eerily glowing blue-white teeth. The fast-moving creatures are plenty scary but in less aggressive circumstances might almost qualify like their teen adversaries as cuddly.

Bob Dylans painting career Russell Crowes band 30 Odd Foot of Grunts the novels of William Shatner - are all destined for the trash pile of cultural history. But on the strength of his feature debut Attack the Block its already clear that in a decades time no one will even remember that Joe Cornish used to be a comedian.At first glance it looks as though Cornish has set the bar low for his first movie. A storyline inspired by the 80s genre movies he grew up with (and lovingly parodied on The Adam and Joe Show) tied to a currently popular film fad - the London yoof movie - and set literally on his doorstep Attack the Block could easily have been a lazy smug sci-fi parody Morons from Outer Space goes gangsta.But like the aliens that rampage through a Brixton tower block this is an entirely unexpected beast. An unrecognisably well-spoken Jodie Whittaker plays Sam the jobbing nurse whose decision to move into a south London estate backfires when shes first mugged by teen thugs then chased by marauding monsters. But Whittaker and comic relief Nick Frost as weed dealer Ron are merely the audience-friendly commercial face of Attack the Block. The real stars are those thugs led by taciturn wannabe player Moses (John Boyega stunning) whose decision to tool up and defend their turf kicks the plot into high gear.And this is an astonishingly fast-moving film. Cornish doesnt do eerie build-ups or character-establishing dialogue scenes its pedal to the metal from the word go and we learn on the hoof about Mosess family issues Rons business troubles and the complex relationships within the gang. This can make the opening scenes confusing there are a lot of characters to keep up with. But it pays off in pure adrenaline were never given a second to settle and the result is exhilarating. Gradually characters emerge and its here that Cornishs skill as writer and director becomes evident. These kids start out as caricatures - the moody leader the speccy geek the mouth - but the respect shown to them is hugely refreshing and their progressions are heartfelt and wholly believable Shane Meadows would be proud.All of which elevates Attack the Block from fun creature-feature throwback to this years unmissable British movie and Cornish from just another geek-turned-filmmaker to a major talent if he can strike a similar balance between sympathy insight and crowd-pleasing thrills in future projects his status is assured.Attack the Block isnt perfect - the aliens are a tad unremarkable and the final blowout never hits the frenzied peak it might have - but its hard to imagine British audiences having more fun in a cinema this year.

I guess that is funny in a meta sort of way. No appeal at all to anyone outside of the UK.

The Horror fans would have seen it all before the US kids will be put off by the accents the snobby/arty elite will certainly find it all a bit too silly to care about its message but I must confess I came to it with very few expectations and even though it took me way too long to get into it (its hard to care or sympathise with kids who in the beginning are shown assaulting and mugging people) once I was finally with it I actually found it all rather enjoyable for the its slightly trashy fake-B-movie sensibility (but a lot more clever than it claims it is) its mix of horror and humour (though not incredibly funny nor too scary) and its retro-80s sensibility and in the end I was happy I saw it though Im not as enthusiastic as this Time Out reviewer MY FULL REVIEW on my BLOG wp.me/p19wJ2-o2FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 18 2011MHFeaturedI think this may be the most fun film so far this year.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 31 2011JJPFeaturedHUDDLESTONS REVIEW BEGAN WITH A 2-PARAGRAPH SHOW-OFF OF HIS RESEARCH (BORING) HAVING NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MOVIE; I THINK THE FILM ITSELF IS FAR MORE INTERESTING THAN PEOPLE HAVE SAID.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 31 2011JJPFeaturedHUDDLESTONS REVIEW BEGAN WITH A 2-PARAGRAPH SHOW-OFF OF HIS RESEARCH (BORING) HAVING NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MOVIE; I THINK THE FILM ITSELF IS FAR MORE INTERESTING THAN PEOPLE HAVE SAID.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 29 2011JanFeaturedI did not find the film scary I found the morals strange the characters flat.

Essentially its an episode of Doctor Who with no star and a 15 certificate.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 27 2011disappointed filmgoerFeaturedI was really looking forward to this film as Id been a fan of the Adam and Joe Show years ago and its had great reviews but I really found the central characters hard to sympathise with. They basically kill an alien life form just because they dont like the look of it and then were supposed to care if they get eaten themselves? Sorry but I didnt. Id have happily seen them all devoured. And the aliens were actually quite cute and fluffy. Some of it was entertaining but I was basically unmoved.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 26 2011andyFeaturedNot brilliantbut not bad.Not on par with James Cameron but then it is not really meant to be.Plenty of action but it did lack tensionbut I dont think that really mattered that much because it was quite a character driven movie.It set up the stereotypes and then slowly deconstructs them when you start to get to know the kids and what motivates them.The begining of the film was inspired by Joe Cornish getting mugged practically on his doorstep and then talking to kids in his area to find out what motivated some of them to mug people in the first place.So you can tell he has sympathy for his characters.Like I said though if you dont go expecting an Aliens or Predator type filmrather a mildly amusing British caper movie with aliens thrown in then most people will find it entertaining enough.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 24 2011Ms DomesticaFeaturedHilarious. And not (despite some of the other contents) not 2 dimensional nor without moral content. The characters grow as plot unfolds some meet sticky ends granted but the yoof get to take their hoodies off and they get to see beyond their own prejudices and all the while a very Kung-Fu David Carradine kind of message is being drummed out you reap what you sew And I loved the low budget effects.

AvoidFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 16 2011SkimbleFeaturedI really enjoyed ""Attack the Block"" Despite the unpleasantness of the characters initial actions they eventually become realised as fully 3-dimensional characters that one feels affection for regardless. This film sets out to show that the hoody-wearing teenagers that people cross the street to avoid are more than faceless spectres to be feared. This country appears to be set on demonising yoof at the present time and that trend is written all over the film. I enjoyed little flourishes like Pest removing his hat midway through the film and suddenly becoming a real person who looks like any other teenager you might see about the revelation that Moses is only 15 but ""looks older"". I do agree that this seems likely to be a love it or loathe it sort of film but Im certainly among those who loved it.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 15 2011DVFeaturedAre you people on the take???

If the dialogue was as good as the filming it would be a masterpiece. I could be wrong but somehow the street language did not sound at all natural from some of the younger cast.
