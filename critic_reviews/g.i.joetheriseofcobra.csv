Comments (1) click to enlarge G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra Free Video Rated PG-13  118 minutes  2009 Back when I was young enough to play with dolls--sorry ""action figures""--G.I. Joe was just a modestly proportioned multiply articulated World War II grunt but since then he seems to have mutated into an ultrabuff multiracial gender-integrated corps of elite commandos. Loud shiny and critic-proof this franchise launcher is basically Transformers minus the humanity. Dennis Quaid provides some ballast as grizzled patriarch to the troop of sexy young lock-and-loaders Christopher Eccleston (Shallow Grave) slums as a bargain-basement evil genius and Stephen Sommers (Van Helsing) directed.

Joe"" -- 2 stars Share | ""G.I. Joe"" may not be beefier but its cheesier and less aggravating than ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen""  the summer 09 headbanger it most resembles. Better than ""Transformers 2""  Do you realize how little that actually says? Nonetheless its true and the rather astonishing body count of ""G.I. Joe"" which is based on the Hasbro toys puts it in the wantonly destructive realm of a Roland Emmerich  disaster picture. You cant really talk about director Stephen Sommers  two-hour blur in terms of individual scenes. Its all one big scene full of impalings--this movies really into impalings plus eye-stabbings--and Dennis Quaids  Gen. Hawk  glowering and a story about a Scottish arms dealers evil plan to rule the world by way of a biological engineering nasty called ""nanomites."" These are metal-devouring creations that can be loaded into warheads and aimed say at the Eiffel Tower because American blockbusters can never get enough of beating up Paris. ""They will not stop"" someone says of the insidious creatures before uttering the scripts least necessary word  ""Ever."" The movie does not stop ever either. Sommers did the first two chaotic ""Mummy""  remakes; those play like ""Tender Mercies""  compared to this one. Channing Tatum (who occasionally seems to be working up the nerve to actually act or something) stars as Duke who joins the super-secret elite international squad known as ""the Joes""  (plus Janes) along with his pal Ripcord played by the films one comic spark Marlon Wayans. The best 10 or 15 minutes of this metallic romp shows off what our Joes and Janes can do while wearing ""acceleration suits."" For example? Run 100 miles an hour. Get hit by fast-moving vehicles and come up smiling. All kinds of stuff. Not bad this scene. As for the rest well not good. But at least theres a moment of inadvertent comedy when someones gassing on about the acceleration suits  ""highly pressurized pneumatics"" and youre not sure if hes talking about the suits or Sienna Millers cleavage. The ending leaves every door open for a sequel for the record. MPAA rating PG-13 (for strong sequences of action violence and mayhem throughout)Running time 158Starring Channing Tatum (Duke); Marlon Wayans (Ripcord); Sienna Miller (Ana); Joseph Gordon-Levitt (The Doctor); Rachel Nichols (Shana OHara)Directed by Stephen Sommers. Written by Stuart Beattie David Elliot  and Paul Lovett. Produced by Lorenzo di Bonaventura Bob Ducsay and Sommers. A Paramount Pictures release. Posted at 022538 PM Comments I think this review is right on its a terrible movie. You could almost write a book with all that is terrible about it. It is quite obvious why these types of movies make so much money; just look at all the comments on this page morons love to pay to see garbage. Posted by John | December 10 2009 at 0420 PM First off the first 2 Mummy Films were major box office hits that were also very sucessful in both the Rental Market and sell-thru so its disengenous to say anything negative about them beyound ""I personally did not like the movies"" because more then enough (and were talking billions amongst all media) dollars spent are saying so As for GI Joe; if you went in hoping for this Years Bourne or similiar then you deserve to be disappointed if for no other reason then poor expectations. While this film is certainly not going to get any awards it will nad so far HAS gotten dollars at the box office and thats what matters. I personally nejoyed this film and plan to see it at least once more before it hits the second run theatres where I will possibly see it again. ANd I will be there at WalMart the day it is released to DVD to pick up my copy on Blu-Ray. Bottom line - If you go to a movie like this expecting a heavy story line with unexpected plot twists then you deserve to be dispappointed. For those who still go to these films for the large screen amp; popcorn experience and are looking for something that is not reality (watch the news if you want reality) then GI Joe is for you Posted by Blue Collar Critic | August 19 2009 at 0249 PM Why do people hate this movie? Is it just to feel superior. If you want to see realistic soldiers see Black Hawk Down or something. The G.I. Joe characters were a kids toy line. The story is for the young at heart. Maybe a little too violent for younger kids today but this movie was great fun to watch. The effects were impressive. The music was great Posted by Arius | August 17 2009 at 0846 AM G.i.jane was good but G.I.Joe is horrible and prob the worst movie of all time... Posted by Joe | August 13 2009 at 0958 PM Marlon Wayans was the sole ""comic spark"" in the movie? My friends and I thought Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Christopher Eccleston were wonderfully hilarious as Cobra Commander and Destro They were both so over the top it seemed like they were in competition to see who chew the most scenery. They clearly brought a sense of camp to their villainous roles which provided some welcome relief from the earnest seriousness of poor Channing Tatum. Posted by Michelle | August 10 2009 at 0652 PM Great movie. Action packed. Takes you back to your childhood. Posted by atm | August 08 2009 at 0642 PM I wonder if well see a spike in rentals of GI Jane. Posted by Omer M. Mozaffar | August 07 2009 at 0529 PM ""The ending leaves every door open for a sequel for the record."" Really? The ending does this? You mean the subtitle ""The Rise of COBRA"" wasnt a big enough clue that there would be more than one G.I. Joe movie? Sorry for being so...short...with the review but one would hope a little critical thought would go into your writing.

Joe The Rise of Cobra A Summer-Season Toy-Soldier Flick Tuesday August 4 2009 at 4 a.m. By Chuck Wilson 1 A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Credited as the first ""action figure"" G.I. Joe came to life in 1964 as Hasbros answer to Mattels Barbie doll. There were actually four Joes--one for each branch of the armed forces--and in the imaginations of boys everywhere they fought Nazis. Forty-odd years later the Joes have evolved into an international band of soldiers seeking to bring down the evil Cobra Command. In the first of whats likely to be a lucrative new film series director Stephen Sommers (The Mummy series Van Helsing) outfits actors Channing Tatum and Marlon Wayans in ""accelerator suits"" that allow them to jump cars and buses in a single bound as they and their team attempt to retrieve a suitcase containing nano technology that a lunatic billionaire (Christopher Eccleston) plans to use for world domination. After a first hour that plays like a bad TV show Sommers hits his groove with an over-the-top Paris chase sequence that in turn leads to an underwater finale thats absurdly overproduced momentarily diverting and then instantly forgettable. The script--by Stuart Beattie David Elliot and Paul Lovett-- is full of embarrassingly bad dialogue but a recent midnight screening audience laughed benignly as if to say that they hadnt exactly been expecting profundity and wit from a summer-season toy-soldier flick.

Joe The Rise of Cobra on its opening day this film is destined to make big noise at the box office.It does on the screen as well. G.I. Joe is a brazen earsplitting eye-popping oddly satisfying action extravaganza though it veers wildly off-target in its second hour.Your fingers will start out gripping the seat handles and end up tapping them impatiently.Unlike previous incarnations Joe is not a character in this movie. Instead its the name of a crack clandestine special-ops unit commanded by General Hawk (Dennis Quaid swaggering around like a stunted John Wayne). Still dont know who or what Cobra is.Two soldiers Duke (Channing Tatum) and his slapstick sidekick Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) want in but the general informs them ""You dont ask to join G.I. Joe. You get asked.""Ah but Duke has a trump card. Hes the ex-fiance of Ana (Sienna Miller in a pneumatic push-up bra). His demure former sweetheart is now living a double life. Shes the unstoppable enforcer for an evil cabal plotting to rule the world.In her downtime shes the wife of a clueless French baron greeting her hubby with sweet nothings like ""Hello Daniel. How was your meeting with the defense minister?""The leading man Tatum has the doughty look of a young action hero but lacks the larger-than-life presence to float this film. Doesnt really matter because the real stars of G.I. Joe get locked loaded and discharged.The problem as in the Transformers films is that once the fighting starts its almost impossible to tell the good guys and bad guys apart.As the movie jolts along the battle scenes grow more elaborate sustained and unconvincing. Meanwhile the implausibilities mount up. Its hard to believe for instance an American president with a plummy British accent.G.I. Joes mission is to provide moviegoers with bang for their buck. And in this it succeeds.Action? Virtually nonstop. Big-budget sheen? Check. Explosive CGI effects? In spades. Futuristic weapons? Loaded for rhino.OK its seriously deficient in plot or acting. But in this genre those two ingredients are as superfluous as canoes in a desert.Contact staff writer David Hiltbrand at 215-854-4552 or dhiltbrandphillynews.com.

Joe the next phase of Paramounts Cash for Clunkers campaign begun with Transformers 2. You know we lay out the cash and the studio thoughtfully supplies the clunkers.In a tight economy why do we lavish cash on movies based on plastic battle toys? Maybe we just want some dumb fun. Too bad they left out the fun part. There are special effects lots of them but despite a reported 170 million budget they look shockingly crappy. The Eiffel Tower appears to be destroyed by some green slime left over from the Ghostbusters films. Among the actors the smartest are Sienna Miller and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Not because they reveal depths of emotion but because theyve disguised themselves so as not to be easily recognized. (Click here to watch Peter Travers video review of G.I. Joe) For background G.I. Joe isnt just one soldier. The Joes are an elite multinational military operation run by General Hawk (Dennis Quaid). The goal is stop arms dealer McCullen (Brit actor Christopher Eccleston wielding the most outrageous Scottish accent since Fat Bastard) from destroying the world with warheads packed with cockroaches. Well they looked like roaches to me. McCullen calls then nanomites. No one really bothers to explain how these nanomites morph from insects into green slime. And this in a movie that helpfully tells us via subtitle that Paris is in France. (Check out more news and reviews from Peter Travers on the Travers Take) I could load you up with more plot details but this mercilessly incoherent galactically stupid movie left me too numb to type. I can tell you that G.I. Joe isnt as rank as Transformers 2. The people who made it spearhead by director Stephen Sommers (whose hack touch is all over the Mummy trilogy and Van Helsing) actually seem to be enjoying tarting themselves out for a paycheck. Transformers 2 director Michael Bay on the other hand is clearly a cynic who believes audiences deserve the garbage he so profitably dumps on them. There is an antidote if you see G.I. Joe and feel unclean. Get a copy of Team America World Police the 2004 puppet musical from South Parks Trey Parker and Matt Stone. It totally skewers the America Fuck Yeah idiocy on parade here. Ill save the last word for the guy who sat in front of me this morning at the mostly empty theater showing G.I. Joe (the studio refused to screen the movie for critics). Right before the movie ended with a big reveal this dude rose from his seat shot me a look that could serve as a model for Disappointed Fan and mumbled as he headed home Ah shit.

"G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; g-i-joe-the-rise-of-cobra ) G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra (United States 2009) August 07 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Not that long ago toys were developed from movies. Now its the other way around. This wouldnt be a bad thing if the filmmakers took the time and effort to do something interesting with the premise. Even considering how well-established is the basic premise of the G.I. Joe/Cobra Command opposition theres still room for latitude. No rule exists to demand that every game- or toy-based movie pander to the least common denominator and never attempt anything exciting or interesting yet thats what always seems to happen. Take G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra for instance. Opportunities exist for this movie to emerge from the crowded pack of brain-dead action films but it doesnt even try. I assume it achieves (if only barely) what most prospective viewers expect from it. A 13-year old version of myself might be entertained if not impressed. Its better than Transformers Revenge of the Fallen - not because the screenplay is shows more creativity (it doesnt) but because the direction is more sure-handed. You may not care about whats happening but at least youll be able to understand it. Theres no sense that the cameraman is having a seizure when filming an action scene. Theres an unwarranted arrogance associated with G.I. Joe. Most first would-be-franchise movies have the good sense to at least provide a feeling of closure at the end of the initial installment but not this one. By the end of this movie little has been wrapped up. There are loose ends dangling everywhere. G.I. Joe exists not as a stand-alone entity but as a tease for future installments which makes it a profoundly unsatisfying experience in the here-and-now before those sequels have been made. And if they are never made this will be like The Golden Compass - a frustratingly incomplete example of Hollywood misjudgment. Theres a rule of thumb that nearly all movies adhere to make a solid first effort then expand the canvas and offer the cliffhanger with movie 2. For those who may be unaware G.I. Joe is not a person its an organization. Its like the X-Men except the members gain their superpowers through technology and training rather than innate ability. There are some neat gadgets here - the kinds of things that would give James Bond wet dreams. General Hawk (Dennis Quaid) is the tough guy who presides over this unit of elite warriors. They come to the rescue with the escort transporting a cutting edge NATO weapon comes under attack by the bad guys an organization called Cobra. Most of the ""regulars"" are killed with two exceptions square-jawed Duke (Channing Tatum) and wisecracking Ripcord (Marlon Wayans). Their knowledge about the female nemesis the beautiful and deadly Ana (Sienna Miller) results in their temporary attachment to G.I. Joe. And know her they do - four years ago Duke was engaged to be married to her. Hell hath no fury as they say... The bad guys led by megalomaniac McCullen (Christopher Eccleston) have their own motto ""Try try again."" So after failing to capture the weapon on their first attempt they mount an attack on G.I. Joe headquarters. This one is more successful. With the tables turned the elite warriors now must seek Ana and her cohorts before the doomsday clock strikes twelve. G.I. Joe is pretty much wall-to-wall action delivered at such pace that when there are brief breaks for expository flashbacks (nearly every character gets about two minutes worth of backstory) the lull is noticeable. Director Stephen Sommers (The Mummy) operates in only one gear. This could be an asset if we cared about any of the characters but they remain as plastic as the toys that inspired them. One common argument leveled against criticisms of films like this is that there should not be an expectation of things like ""character development"" in a G.I. Joe. While I might agree that any real depth of personality could be undesirable in an atmosphere of pure adrenaline its a long-standing rule of action films that tension and excitement are tied to the viewers ability to root for the protagonist and its hard to root for someone who is underdeveloped or undeveloped. G.I. Joe is chock full of high-tech action with a lot of chasing and shooting and explosions. There are some old-fashioned fist-fights and a little samurai dueling but most of the production is geared toward the ""boys with toys"" crowd - and the bigger the toys the better. Sommers style is slick and glossy and although the movie still runs long its nowhere near as unending as Transformers Revenge of the Fallen. The film also includes the requisite scenes of global catastrophe. In this case we are presented with the destruction of a famous Parisian icon. Somehow however after 9/11 its no longer as fun to watch big high-profile structures come tumbling down. The real-life collapse of the Twin Towers made it difficult to sit though a movie disaster scene of this sort and not feel a little unsettled. Some of the actors enjoy themselves. Christopher Eccleston who has a penchant for playing odd and mysterious characters has fun interpreting a James Bond-type villain. Sienna Miller with dark hair and darker glasses is almost unrecognizable as Ana. Sommers Mummy actors Brendan Fraser and Arnold Vosloo have small parts. Marlon Wayans adds an element of humor in the ""sidekick"" role. Unfortunately lead actor Channing Tatum is wooden. Duke is more animated in sequences when he is rendered by special effects than when being portrayed by Tatum. Theres an expectation that the audience will be invested in the relationship between Duke and Ana but the poor writing and lack of chemistry between the principals fails to sell the romance as anything more substantial than a weak plot element. To the extent that G.I. Joe is intended to replicate what a childs imagination might conjure up for a bunch of action figures purchased at Toys R Us the movie succeeds. Its action porn with one money shot after another and little in the way of intelligent connective tissue. Its pleasing to the eye but not to any other organ. Paramounts decision to withhold the film from critics was well-founded; theres little here anyone who regards movies cerebrally will appreciate. Its loud slick and vacuous but Hollywoods balance sheets have proven theres a market for this sort of motion picture. The question is whether G.I. Joe will prove popular enough to siphon off enough of that market to make it profitable. Because with a movie like this its about the dollars and nothing else - certainly not storytelling. G.I.

Email| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Paramount has gone to a lot of trouble to keep its 175 million action extravaganza ""G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra from the prying eyes of critics and sneak-preview audiences. The studio says it hopes to avoid the sort of brutal catcalls that greeted ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen a movie which with almost 400 million in tickets sold is no ones idea of a victim.The suits shouldnt have bothered ""G.I. Joe is a loud but proficient slab of explode-o-rama summer blockbuster nonsense perfectly entertaining if you like that sort of thing extremely skippable if you dont. The difference between the ""Transformers franchise and this is the difference between the aggressively stupid and the acceptably dumb. In a spirit of pure generosity Ive awarded an extra half-star to ""Joe for not being a Michael Bay movie.Any resemblance to actual soldiers and actual warfare is accidental of course. ""G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra is instead a simple and simple-minded superhero comic book with a vaguely military theme. The heroes of the super-secret international G.I. Joe team taken from several earlier incarnations of TV series and video games include blandly handsome Duke (Channing Tatum) ace flyboy and comic relief Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) silent ninja fighter Snake Eyes (Ray Park) computer genius Breaker (Said Taghmaoui) and brainiac Scarlett (Rachel Nichols) all under the gruff command of General Hawk (Dennis Quaid).Against them are a bunch of baddies bent on - what else? - world domination and theyve got nano-bombs that can make a meal out of the Eiffel Tower in minutes. They include Dukes ex-girl-friend the Baroness (Sienna Miller) a sneering Scottish arms merchant (Christopher Eccleston) and of all people Joseph Gordon-Levitt that nice young man from ""(500) Days of Summer as the supervillainous Doctor.Park played Darth Maul in ""Star Wars Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace and he gets to restage that films climactic duel complete with double-saber above a bottomless pit. Under the direction of Stephen Sommers whose ""Mummy films are similarly hectic deafening and disposable ""G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra avoids gung-ho jingoism and commentary on real-world politics - thankfully the movie understands its based on a line of plastic toys.As such it functions very much as the fantasy of a small boy with an overactive imagination and a limitless budget - your average Hollywood producer say. At times it cheats When Duke and Ripcord don high-tech ""accelerator suits and embark on a rock-em-sock-em chase through the streets of Paris were moved way beyond both backyard play and genuine soldiering.That sequence by the way is state-of-the-art mayhem in which landmarks collapse buildings are incinerated and hundreds of innocent bystanders are apparently killed. The characters never stop to notice and really why should they? Its just the French.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The live-action feature film G.I. Joe The Rise Of Cobra does to the 80s animated TV series/toy commercial G.I. Joe (and associated comics and spin-offs) what the 2000 X-Men movie did to that franchise. By putting a bunch of exaggeratedly individualized characters into identical black leather outfits and giving them all the same grunt-y bad-ass personal affect the film irons out the series traces of personality and makes it largely generic blockbuster fodder. At the same time the filmmakers have gone out of their way to respect the source material from in-jokey fan-bait lines like ""Knowing is half the battle"" and ""Hes a real American hero"" to the giant secret evil base with a self-destruct button. The plot too is a sprawling international action-caper that could have come straight from the old TV show. Arms manufacturer Christopher Eccleston has developed nanotech warheads capable of destroying a city; a private assault team headed by Sienna Miller is out to steal them and terrorize the world into submission. When they assault a military convoy transferring the warheads survivors Channing Tatum and Marlon Wayans get absorbed into the elite international commando unit G.I. Joe under the command of Dennis Quaid doing a passable John Wayne impression. As Miller and her compatriots (including mad scientist Joseph Gordon-Levitt and brooding ninja Byung-hun Lee) keep trying to get at the warheads and set them loose on the world director Stephen Sommers has the story play out via a series of closely chained setpieces based so heavily on glistening future-tech effects that the film has a Sky Captain And The World Of Tomorrow gloss; the whole world feels shiny artificial and calculated. That goes double for the characters all broad archetypes acting out simple cliches. (At one point Tatum actually displays his manly angst over a fallen comrade by glumly driving by the mans funeral on a motorcycle in the rain in shades and black leather.) The central plot-driving relationship between Tatum and Miller is entirely rote as is the acting which mostly consists of yelling and macho one-liners. But unlike Michael Bay with the similar Hasbro-cartoon update Transformers Sommers seems to understand that viewers didnt show up for cheesy human interaction. Instead he covers the screen with nearly nonstop action thats slick and propulsive yet clearly choreographed and easy to follow. Much like previous Sommers films (The Mummy Van Helsing) The Rise Of Cobra holds to a thrill-ride sensibility thats unchallenging and more than a little goofy but exciting and consistently well-managed. It gets wearisome by the end but at times--particularly in the Parisian car chase with two cyborg-suited men and the ninja Snake Eyes trying to prevent catastrophe--its a strong rival for Star Trek among the summers most purely exciting action films.

Stephen Cole Globe and Mail Update Published Friday Aug. 07 2009 915PM EDT Last updated Wednesday Mar. 27 2013 1239PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English G.I.Joe The Rise of CobraDirected by Stephen SommersWritten by Stuart Beattie and David ElliotStarring Dennis Quaid Channing Tatum Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje Sienna Miller Christopher Eccleston Marlon Wayans and Joseph Gordon-LevittClassification PGThe new G.I. Joe movie cost 175-million (U.S.) to make and is as cluttered as a nine-year-olds bedroom. Nevertheless the only half-way decent kids action movie of the summer somehow manages to capture the simplistic pleasures of little boys playing war in a sandbox. X-Men Origins Wolverine and Transformers 2 are the work of grown ups working too hard at being fun. At the very least G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra knows how to kid around.The plot feels both familiar and far-fetched. A squad of global crime fighters go toe to toe with an evil wafer-thin Scottish arms dealer. The fight is plainly unfair. Destro (Christopher Eccleston) has nuclear hardware an army of reptilian super villains and a sexy hit woman in Sarah Palin eyewear (Sienna Miller). Whereas all the Joes have going for them are bulging biceps and stubby nicknames Duke (Channing Tatum) Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) Heavy Duty (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and General Hawk (Dennis Quaid).Still no need to ask who is going to win. Or whether our sand box survives. In its berserk two-hour running time G.I. Joe features a dozen calamities Trains are pulverized and ice caps melted. In the films big noisy centrepiece the Eiffel Tower is swatted aside like an unwanted toy on Boxing Day. Still kids will understand that the characters - all based on Hasbro play-toys - are action figures. Even if their arms are yanked off Duke and Destro will be good as new tomorrow. Same with our ice caps and the Eiffel Tower. Well maybe not the ice caps.For all its crazily moving parts the new G.I. Joe is easy to follow. Transformers 2 was like a football game played in the mud. Most scrimmages it was impossible to tell one team from another. Not G.I. Joe. In the ongoing Ninja fight scenes one Ninja wears white; the other one black.The film which is directed by Stephen Sommers (The Mummy) also masters the comic book art of snappy cartoon balloon dialogue. Most of the short sharp punch lines connect. Sample sparring Heavy Duty ""What you see before you are Delta-6 accelerator suits.""Ripcord ""What do they accelerate?""Heavy Duty ""You.""Adult viewers will find stuff to complain about here. The film is too long. Too loud. Miller spills from her costume without ever filling out her character. Only Eccleston (Dr. Who) as the chief villain and Wayans clowning Ripcord are really any fun.Make no mistake G.I.Joe The Rise of Cobra isnt family fare or a kids movie adults will enjoy like Up . Actually it kind of resembles the South Park gangs Team America World Police played straight. The film is not without honour however. There arent many movies that can replicate the preposterous logic of childs play - sandbox scenes where a kid takes a toy plane in his hand and shouts out pilots commands.That scene actually takes place in the new G.I. Joe as Ripcord steals one of Destros fighter jets and knocks out a nuclear warhead by talking Gaelic () to the aircrafts instrument panel.Speaking of childish according to a studio spokesperson Rob Moore Paramount decided not to screen G.I. Joe ""[in response to]the chasm we experienced with Transformers 2 between the response of the audience and critics.""As if critics have ever determined popular hits. Mr. Moore should learn from the great PR master Andy Warhol who once proclaimed ""Dont pay any attention to what they write about you. Just measure it in inches.""

Joe Were Gay? By Ramin Setoodeh On 8/6/09 at 800 PM CulturePssst what are you doing here so late? Its almost midnight and the man seated behind me is professing his love for G.I. Joe. He was a fan at 12 who loyally watched the cartoon series and he still owns 30 comic books dedicated to the toy soldier. In fact hes such a groupie that hes at the first screening (1201 a.m. Friday) of the new movie G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra with hundreds of other New Yorkers. And me. I used to love G.I. Joe too but Im here for an entirely different reason. Paramount wouldnt screen the movie for critics probably because the studios feelings were hurt when reviewers attacked Transformers 2 like it was the sequel to Gigli. ""We chose to forgo reviews as a strategy to promote G.I. Joe"" said a studio official diplomatically earlier this week. ""We want audiences to define this film."" How democratic. Does that mean the rest of us can now vote at the Oscars too?Once I sat down I was disappointed to see that the theater was half-empty and hardly anybody looked awake or excited. I was starting to feel drowsy too when the picture began and jolted me back to life. G.I. Joe is like watching fireworks with a blindfold on its deafening and you feel under attack. The story makes no sense--why does the Eiffel Tower topple over after being covered in sparkling slime? And worst of all Sienna Miller and Channing Tatum a charismatic guy whom The New York Times once compared to Marlon Brando have the chemistry of two ice cubes. As my mind wandered I started to imagine ways for the director to have reinvented the franchise for the 21st century. What if the G in G.I. Joe didnt just stand for ""government""? What if it also stood for ""gay""?To many G.I. Joe fans who grew up collecting the action figures this might be blasphemy. Who cares? The best summer action movies--The Bourne Identity The Dark Knight--always come with tortured heroes who carry around deep secrets. Imagine the dramatic possibilities For starters we could ditch Sienna Miller which would be a big improvement right from the start. Dukes (Tatum) new love interest would be a male soldier. The movie would even strike a note of social relevance given that our troops still adhere to ""Dont Ask Dont Tell"" (i.e. Duke couldnt blab about his love life to any of his friends). Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Hollywood likes to cast gay characters in supporting roles as background scenery but they still dont anchor movies that often. You can understand the cold feet the movie business is about selling tickets to teenage boys and even Bruno tanked. This week there was a storm of protest online when Robert Downey Jr. suggested his onscreen Sherlock Holmes--scheduled to hit theater screens on Christmas--might have had a gay fling with Watson (Jude Law). Gawker described the ""full blown gay panic"" from conservative film critic Michael Medved. ""Who is going to watch Downey Jr. and Law make out?"" he asked. ""I dont think it would be appealing to women. Straight men dont want to see it.""Medveds off base--the Sherlock Holmes screenplay doesnt even feature a male kiss and action heroes have been a little gay since the beginning of the genre. Look at Supermans revealing red tights. Or Batmans ""friendship"" with Robin. James Bond is such a good dresser he might as well be gay (at one point Rupert Everett even wanted to star as a gay James Bond). So maybe its just a matter of time before we see our first openly gay action hero. At 2 a.m. Id wasted enough of my time on G.I. Joe. But before I fled I wanted to check in on an elderly woman who had come to see the movie alone. She looked shellshocked in the lobby but it turned out that she was only crying tears of joy. Apparently she couldnt wait for the sequel.I started to back away but it was so late that I didnt think it would hurt if I sprang my idea on her. What if in the next movie G.I. Joe were gay? Would she still buy a ticket? Her face lit up. ""Absolutely"" she said. ""Just because youre gay doesnt mean youre not powerful.""Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Joe The Rise of Cobra August 7 2009 323 PM By Rafer Guzman rafer.guzmannewsday.com + - The team from ""G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra.? Photo Credit Frank Masi / Paramount Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Elite soldiers battle a corrupt arms dealer named Destro. BOTTOM LINE The movie succeeds by simply crashing headfirst through every obstacle. CAST Dennis Quaid Channing Tatum Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje Christopher Eccleston Sienna Miller DIRECTOR Stephen Sommers LENGTH 158 If youre a connoisseur of loud expensive action films you surely saw last years ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" whose niftiest special effect was the armor-plated termites that dissolved every gun tank and edifice in their path. And if you buy a ticket for ""G.I. Joe"" based on the Hasbro action figures youll see those metallic insects yet again. Here theyre called nanomites manufactured by an evil Scottish munitions mogul named McCullen (Christopher Eccleston). The movie breathlessly shows them eating through metal and the occasional human as if this were a wildly original concept. Thats ""G.I. Joe"" in a high-tech nutshell trading in cliches without a hint of embarrassment. advertisement | advertise on newsday In a film as ridiculous as this one pure gall can be a virtue. It begins weirdly in the year 1641 -- dont ask -- then flash-forwards to a futuristic present as McCullen hatches the usual plot to conquer the world. At his side are a gun-toting vixen named Ana (Sienna Miller strangely boring) and an unnamed evil scientist who hides his maimed face behind a black gas mask. To the rescue comes G.I. Joe not a person but a covert team of super-soliders culled from militaries around the globe and led by General Hawk (Dennis Quaid virtually mimicking John Wayne). This armed fantasy league soon takes on two newcomers Duke (Channing Tatum totally expressionless) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans mugging as if to compensate). The special effects can be terrific -- a chase through Paris involves two guys in ""accelerator suits"" running after a speeding SUV -- and director Stephen Sommers (""The Mummy"") adds enough explosions to drown out the dull dialogue (the script required five writers). A few more fireballs could have spared us Alan Silvestris ear-pummeling score too. MoviesTrailer G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra Still its enjoyable enough while its speeding along. Like the Joes themselves the movie succeeds by simply crashing headfirst through every obstacle. advertisement | advertise on newsday gt;gt;  Showtimes and tickets Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

Joe team from left Channing Tatum Dennis Quaid Said Taghmaoui Rachel Nichols and Marlon Wayans. The movie belongs in the ranks of most embarrassing summer blockbusters. (Frank Masi) Joe Neumaier Friday August 7 2009 216 PM Title G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra Maybe if they would have used the actual poseable action figures the producers of ""G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra"" would have gotten some lively performances. As it is star Channing Tatum speaks his lines as if someone is pulling the voice cord attached to his neck.The dialogue of course isnt the point of ""G.I.Joe"" which wasnt screened for critics before opening and for good reason. Director Stephen Sommers actioner joins such embarrassing company as ""The Avengers"" ""Lost in Space"" ""Wild Wild West"" and ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" in the annals of inane summer would-be blockbusters that make your brain bleed.Sure big dumb fun can be big dumb fun but Sommers goes beyond the ""more is more"" modus operandi and launches into ""too much is never enough"" territory. The action scenes are all over the place the team (constantly called ""the Joes"" which even to a Joe sounds ridiculous) is blurred into one big mass including the guy swathed in a gray hoodie who never talks and the villains big plot is one weve seen a million times. Well a million and one now. The best fun that can be had here is laughing at the movie which if youre in the mood could warrant a half a star.Tatum is Duke a blank-faced ex-military hotshot recruited with his pal Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) into an exclusive international fighting unit that gets to play with high-tech toys and armor while fighting the worlds evil.Todays evil is brought to you by a Scottish weapons industrialist who wants to force the world to bend to his will and then his operatives will take over. He comes from a long line of rascals apparently because the very first scene takes place in France in the year 1641 and involves a man in an iron mask. Because thats exactly what belongs in a ""G.I. Joe"" movie.As Duke meets the full team -- including General Hawk (Dennis Quaid) Scarlett (Rachel Nichols) Breaker (Said Taghmaoui) and Heavy Duty (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) -- he discovers his onetime love Ana (a ludicrous dark-tressed Sienna Miller) is helping the nasty industrialist in his evil deeds. Theres also a scientist wearing a Darth Vader breathing apparatus some nonsense about nano-robots and a dimly-lit undersea compound that looks like a plumbers dream.Forget the wooden performances -- including Joseph Gordon-Levitt of  ""(500) Days of Summer"" -- the constant flashbacks the ADD-style visuals (even two boys fighting over food is edited with a Ginsu knife). What defines the movie is that the nano-robots eat steel and during a chase to catch the villains and their weapons in Paris someone realizes a major landmark could be the target. It comes as a surprise to the Joes when they realize where theyre headed. Lets see... Paris? Steel? Major landmark? What could that be?Theres a way to do this kind of thing (Just witness Hasbros other toy-turned-dumb movie franchise ""Transformers""). ""G.I. Joe"" though hasnt got a kung fu-grip on what it is.

Joe Rise of the Cobra."" G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra movie review Remember G.I. Joe? The 12-inch doll - excuse me action figure - who looked a little like Kens butch cousin and led countless backyard commando raids and schoolyard recons? Well then skip ""G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra."" G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra (PG-13) Paramount (118 min.) Directed by Stephen Sommers. With Channing Tatum Joseph Gordon-Levitt Sienna Miller Dennis Quaid. Now playing in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys rating ONE AND A HALF STARS Ratings note The film contains a few vulgar words and non-stop violence. Because this movie isnt about that toy or its graying fans but the next generation - kids who chiefly remember an `80s cartoon series ""G.I. Joe A Real American Hero."" And the result is a movie thats more sci-fi than semper fi - and possibly the most proudly mindless epic of the year. The film which did not screen for most critics (fanboys who could reliably be counted on to pronounce it ""Awesome"" got a sneak peak) looks like the worlds longest effects reel. There are plenty of things blowing up catching fire or crashing into each other. Its a superb audition tape if its effects experts are looking for new jobs. But theres no fun no characters no suspense. The dolls were more lifelike. The charisma-impaired Channing Tatum plays Duke; the resolutely unappealing Marlon Wayons is his best buddy Ripcord. (The character names - which include such howlers as ""Dr. Mindbender"" - give you an idea of the general wit involved.) Both soldiers survive an attack on their unit in which a terrorist squad led by a femme fatale in a catsuit steals four experimental new weapons. So to get them back and avenge their buddies Duke and Ripcord join the G.I. Joe team - an elite international squad. Its the only elite thing about the whole movie. Stephen Sommers who at least showed a sense of good humor in the first ""Mummy"" remake seems to have directed on a constant IV drip of Red Bull. No one walks when they can run no one runs when they can jump and eventually everything blows up. It all soon feels like excess for the sake of excess - as if Sommers would have been just as happy filming himself throwing the films reputed 175 million budget on a bonfire. Perhaps he should have. Because without any quiet time to break the tension soon there is no tension - just wall-to-wall hyperactive nonsense. It doesnt help either that the ""Joes"" as our heroes are called (which leads to their commanding officer Gen. Hawk shouting things like ""Lets get those Joes outta there"") are so overarmored they foolishly make Iron Man look like a yoga student in drawstrings. Because if a character is invulnerable wheres the risk? Wheres the suspense? Not here in a movie which pads itself out with unnecessary flashbacks or tips its hand ridiculously early as to who its ""surprise"" mastermind is going to be. And rather then building any suspense just gets more obvious as it goes along. Apart from Wayans and Tatum - who delivers his dialogue so lifelessly I kept trying to spot the pull-string coming out of his neck - the cast includes the equally dreadful Sienna Miller and a surprisingly hammy Joseph Gordon-Levitt. On the bright side as Gen. Hawk Dennis Quaid actually gets to yell ""Deploy the sharks"" If youre the sort of fan who thought the new ""Transformers"" was too talky or ""Wolverine"" made too much sense - well ""G.I. Joe"" is here and reporting for duty. Buy your ticket and settle in for two long hours of ribcage-strangling push-up bras and ear-bleeding noise. But if you really love movies - or just have a fond memory of Americas movable fighting man - skip this one. Dig out your old Joes if you have them take them into your back yard and tie a couple of firecrackers to them just like we all used to. Itll be a lot quieter than this flick. And in the end a lot kinder to Joe. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Joe the rise of COBRA dennis quaid joseph gordon-levitt - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie review G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra -- 2 out of 5 stars A scene from G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra Paramount Paramount Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Summer blockbuster season officially ends with the arrival of G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra another brainless popcorn picture built on an awful 80s TV cartoon.Its a Bush-era movie built on a Reagan-era cartoon -- all exotic hardware and can-do commandos endless violence with barely a drop of blood -- the illusion of ""surgical"" warfare reduced to a video game. Its dumb. Its digital. Its derivative. This Joe scripted at a toy-selling TV-cartoon level is a non-stop shoot-em-up edited to induce seizures. And if George Lucas doesnt sue over the blatant Star Wars rip off finale hes missing easy money. Stone-faced dancer-boxer-tough-guy Channing Tatum stars as Duke a soldier who loses a set of valuable missile warheads. An elite team headed by General Hawk ( Dennis Quaid) saves the nanomite (metal-eating micro-robots) bombs and Duke and his pal Ripcord ( Marlon Wayans) are impressed.""When all else fails we dont"" General Hawk growls.This team with its super-secret base beneath the Egyptian desert its super-secret jets super-secret subs and super- secret ""acceleration suits"" borrowed from Iron Man faces off against an evil Scottish arms supplier (Christopher Eccleston) the latest in a long line of ""sell to both sides"" villains according to a prologue. But the G.I. Joes -- Scarlett (Rachel Nichols) Heavy Duty (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) Breaker (Said Taghamaoui) and the silent ninja Snakeyes (Ray Park in a rubber suit) -- may lose their race to save Paris and any other city with metal infrastructure. The arms dealer has the white-suited ninja Storm Shadow (Byung Hun-Lee) slicing up everybody in sight. And in her skin-tight jumpsuit and stiletto heels head henchwoman Ana ( Sienna Miller) is taking no prisoners.For all this Stephen ""The Mummy"" Sommers movies infantile obsession with gadgets heres something he gets right. Miller is a minx of a villain. All her time in the tabloids has given her a sexy angry bad-girl edge. The rest? Action beats weve seen in a hundred other movies from James Bond to The Matrix and those movies set ""in a galaxy far far away.""Its no dumber or emptier than Transformers but G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra cant help but make one cringe when the bad guy says as bad guys in bad scripts always say ""This has only just begun.""G.I.

"G.I. Joe Two hours wasted | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesG.I. Joe Two hours wastedIt is possible that never before in the annals of cinema has so much destruction been depicted on screen to so little purpose unless you count brain or ear damage.The cast of G.I. Joe includes from left Channing Tatum Dennis Quaid Said Taghmaoui Rachel Nichols and Marlon Wayans.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Aug. 7 2009G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra (Out of Four)Starring Channing Tatum Sienna Miller Dennis Quaid Marlon Wayans Lee Byung-hun and Christopher Eccleston. Directed by Stephen Sommers. At theatres everywhere. (PG)There are all kinds of wild and noisy machines in G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra the war toy turned cartoon turned motion picture that is now rotting minds in multiplexes everywhere.The one new gizmo we could sorely use however is sadly lacking. That would be a time machine that could magically restore the two hours lost by anyone unlucky or foolish enough to waste money on this wretched excuse for entertainment.Article Continued BelowIt is possible that never before in the annals of cinema has so much destruction been depicted on screen to so little purpose unless you count brain or ear damage. Neither the clumsy good guys - ""the Joes"" as theyre risibly called - nor the clownish bad guys seem to have a clue as to what theyre doing apart from blowing up as many objects and people as possible. No wonder Paramount Pictures refused to show the film to serious critics limiting advance screenings to drooling fanboys who would agreeably drive up the Rotten Tomatoes score in exchange for access and a bucket of popcorn.If nothing else this exercise in ballistic bathos sets to rest the theory about chimps with typewriters being able produce Shakespeare if given enough time and bananas. They couldnt do the Bard but they evidently penned G.I. Joe - although there a few humans blamed for the deed chiefly Stuart Beattie who co-wrote the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie.The direction is credited to genre hack Stephen Sommers (The Mummy) but the citation seems wholly unwarranted. What pray did Sommers actually do? The picture is little more than an endless series of computer-rendered explosions collisions and incisions with no discernable effort expended on directing or acting. The theory seems to have been that if you keep things moving at all times people wont notice that theres no real plot. It didnt work.In between the flying shrapnel two grudges are pursued in lieu of a story. The first involves Scots weapons expert James McCullen (Christopher Eccleston) who has created a green goo called ""nanomites"" that can dissolve people buildings and the entire world should McCullen get excessively ambitious. Hes cheesed because centuries ago a McCullen ancestor was punished by the French for double-dealing in weapons (insert ironic laughter here).The other grudge has a leather-clad dominatrix known as the Baroness (Sienna Miller) beating up on a particularly dull grunt named Duke (Channing Tatum). Duke apparently failed in his romantic duties when the Baroness was just a naive blonde named Ana. Hell hath no fury etc.McCullen and the Baroness pursue their intersecting vendettas at length pausing just long enough to blow up the Eiffel Tower in Paris as the trailer has already revealed. ""The French are pretty upset"" an aide tells the U.S. President (a slumming Jonathan Pryce).This scene serves only to remind us how funny a similar Eiffel toppling was in Team America World Police the puppet movie by the South Park boys that mocked this kind of lame material.G.I. Joe is too dumb to even attempt a few laughs. A scene where a pilot has to speak in Gaelic (Im not making this up) to voice-operate a jet owned by McCullen is played entirely straight-faced.There are innumerable supporting players in G.I. Joe most too tedious to mention. All will be amply represented on toy store shelves when Hasbro the G.I. Joe toy creator and movie stakeholder cashes in on the many product plugs. It must be said that Dennis Quaid as head Joe boy General Hawk seems totally at ease with the thought his paycheque will have many zeroes and he will soon be buying himself a new swimming pool. Good for him. And Miller is reportedly glad to be finally playing a character who is sexy and violent rather than one who is crazy and pathetic.Speaking of big payouts can it be true that Paramount Pictures blew 175 million (U.S.) making this turkey?If G.I. Joe crashes and burns the way it deserves to there could be a few studio execs looking for their own army of Joes to protect them from angry shareholders.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Joe The Rise of Cobra Related Ninja Warriors - From Myth to the MoviesVladimir Putin Action Figure100 Best Movies of All Time Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME One of the few smart things about G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra was the decision by Paramount Pictures to refuse to screen the movie for the press. The studios previous summer toy story Transformers Revenge of the Fallen had earned a sheaf of pans then took in more than 800 million in its first six weeks of release. Hoping lightning would strike twice but without the annoying critical thunder Paramount showed G.I. Joe which it hopes will be the first in a lucrative series only to a few reliable bloggers. Less docile scribes like me had to catch a public screening last night at midnight. As the old line goes about some long-ago lemon The movie wasnt released -- it escaped. Now that Ive seen the movie I understand the Paramount bosses urge to suppress it. G.I. Joe has plenty of narrative strands most of them taken from the 80s TV cartoon show and Marvel comic version of the antique Hasbro soldier figures but they are woven clumsily. Director Stephen Sommers who did the Mummy trilogy has no skill with actors and little more with the manipulation of real and virtual hardware. We know the theme will be ""War is swell"" but the film plays like a long slog in the Big Muddy. (See pictures of ninja warriors from myth to movies.) Like Paramounts recent spiffed-up Star Trek franchise the new movie casts a number of medium-known young people -- here Channing Tatum Marlon Wayans Rachel Nichols and a few others -- as members of an elite force of the best the brightest and the hottest. G.I. Joe is not a man but an international paramilitary force kind of like Blackwater but without all that messy scandal. The cadre is up against an arms dealer whose organization will eventually spawn Cobra reminiscent of the SPECTRE cartel of the early James Bond films. Theyre the sort of well-bred terrorists who just before firing the weapons that will bring the world to its knees invite a hero into their lair to explain their evil plans and allow him to thwart them. To err on the side of kindness we might guess that the strategy of Sommers and his screenwriters was to ignore the prototype stage of a franchise launch -- a vigorous introduction of the characters and motifs -- and go directly to self-parody. We are told the main story takes place ""In the not too distant future ..."" If that recalls the first line of the old Mystery Science Theater 3000 theme song you will have brought the proper attitude to the movie it hardly needs wisecracking robots for it not only carries the seeds of its own destruction but hands them out like a Burpees salesman. An early scene flashing back to 17th century France plays like a lost Monty Python sketch. For its modern-day Paris scenes the movie borrows some set pieces (including the blowing up of the Eiffel Tower) from Matt Stone and Trey Parkers Team America World Police an action comedy performed by puppets from whom the expressionless performers appear to have taken their acting cues. Im honor-bound to mention a few nice bits. Theres a furious well-orchestrated martial-arts battle between the kids (Brandon Soo Hoo and Leo Howard) who will grow up to be the opposing warriors Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes. My current fave young actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt seems to be wasted in a small role but isnt; hell be more prominent in a sequel. Nichols playing the brainiac ""Scarlett"" OHara has an appealing manner and comely biceps and she engages in a savory girl fight with Sienna Miller as the mostly villainous Baroness. This PG-13 adventure boasts a lot of real and virtual shooting but few of the major characters get killed. The only collateral damage is in the audience where as you sit through the movie you can feel your IQ drop minute by minute. (Read a brief history of G.I. Joe.) At the end a new villain rises and an old bad guy assumes a position of great power. ""This has only just begun"" one of them says explicitly promising or threatening a sequel. Will there be more of the same? It doesnt matter to me or I to the filmmakers; my G.I. tract in fact the communal contumely of critics is irrelevant to box-office performance. G.I. Joe could be a Transformers-size hit or it could be another The Golden Compass the first episode of the His Dark Materials novels; that film cost 180 million and helped drive New Line Cinema out of business. Who knows? Nearly 30 years ago director Robert Benton mused on a famous flop of the day. ""When Steven Spielberg made 1941"" Benton said ""he probably thought thered be a 1942.""

Joe - excess is success MOVIE REVIEW By Peter Hartlaub Published 400 am Saturday August 8 2009 The trailer for ""G.I. Joe The Rise of the Cobra."" Media San Francisco Chronicle G.I. Joe The Rise of the Cobra Action. Starring Dennis Quaid Sienna Miller Channing Tatumand Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Directed by Stephen Sommers. (PG-13. 117 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) If this review makes less sense than normal its because we saw the movie at midnight and wrote it up very early Friday. Like hundreds of bad horror films movies adapted from video games and Jamie Kennedy pictures before it ""G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra"" didnt have a screening for critics. Although there may have been calculated reasons for this move it shows a deeper problem for Hollywood studios Their complete lack of faith in professional moviegoers to appreciate well-executed trash. Yes this movie is essentially a two-hour toy commercial. Yes at times it seems like a sequel to ""Team America World Police"" except with live actors instead of marionettes. (""America %amp; yeah"") Yes Dennis Quaid actually says the words ""When all else fails we dont"" with a straight face. Yes ""G.I. Joe"" would have played a lot better if Sarah Palin were our vice president.

Channing Tatum stars as DUKE the team leader of the elite G.I. JOE squad in ""G.I. JOE The Rise of Cobra."" Photo Paramount Pictures Movie review G.I. Joe - excess is success 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Yes the bloated-with-visual effects final 30 minutes will make audiences yearn for the realistic clutter-free action and human contact of ""Star Wars The Clone Wars."" Yes Jonathan Pryce who was born in Wales was cast as our U.S. president. (Wheres Lou Dobbs when you actually need him?) Yes this film is best enjoyed if youre an 11-year-old boy - or a grown-up man who just drank four cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon. But its hard to deny that the first two-thirds of ""G.I. Joe"" are enjoyable especially when graded on the curve of lowered expectations. Compared with other big-budget movies out this summer its pretty mediocre. But as a movie that no one thought would be any good because its based on an action figure that isnt even a foot tall anymore it succeeds wildly. ""G.I. Joe"" stars Channing Tatum as Duke whose onetime true love Ana (Sienna Miller) now leads a group of well-gadgeted terrorists. When her evil consortium tries to steal a warhead filled with metal-eating nanotechnology robots - which looks suspiciously like a shaken-up can of Mountain Dew - Duke gets recruited into G.I. Joe a sort of international SWAT team that includes Quaid as its leader and a cool-looking ninja dude named Snake Eyes. The whole thing has an ""X-Men""-meets-""Top Gun"" vibe that may seem really dumb if your favorite movie is ""Atonement"" but will be easy to groove right along with if youre the type of person who never turns the channel when ""Commando"" comes on cable. Stuff blows up. Lots of it. Most of the actors are hot-looking and those who arent do cool things with swords. And although the 118-minute movie is about 25 minutes too long the script has a nice self-deprecating feel without losing its sense of patriotic excess. In other words nobody who made this film thought he was making ""Sense and Sensibility."" Sometimes thats a good thing. -- Advisory This film contains strong language violence and some sexuality ... and knowing is half the battle.

JOE By Kyle Smith View author archive email the author follow on twitter Get author RSS feed Name(required) Email(required) Comment(required) August 7 2009 | 1227pm Formerly a real American hero ""G.I. Joe"" is no longer a hero (its a group) or American. (Its a multinational team of military superstars though the way it does business youd feel safer with the Croatian navy on your side.) PHOTOS G.I. Joe Rise of the Cobra Premiere MOVIE BLOG Joe vs. Julia at Box Office As for real well ... I didnt know that you could be three feet away from a building when it blows up and walk away with nothing more than movie-star scratches (cheek eyebrow). Or that trains roar through the streets of Paris alongside the cars. Or that a good guy might flip sides because he stumbled on evil technology and thought it was cool. Duke (Channing Tatum) and Rex (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are a pair of embryoaged majors (add up their ages and theyd be old enough to be a real major) in a secret military force. Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) is their comedic sidekick. Dukes squad hooks up with a secret commando team that calls itself G.I. Joe and is at war with evil counterparts who have no team name but are so inept Ill just call them G.I. Schmo. The toughest Schmo is Dukes foxy catsuit-clad ex Ana (Sienna Miller) who in a lovers snit decided to dump her guy dye her blond hair black and also help annihilate the world. Everyones after the ultimate weapon -""nanomites"" contained in a suitcase (Samsonite?) that can burst into clouds of what look like bad-ass termites that devour everything in sight in disaster scenes that look like they were recycled from ""The Mummy."" That movie and this one share a director Stephen Sommers who also inexplicably places the Joes HQ beneath the Great Pyramids (hell sand worked before) uses the guy who played the Mummy as a baddie named Zartan and even dusts off Brendan Fraser who pops up in the Joes training center but has nothing to do but watch G.I. Joe for five minutes. Which is about how long most viewers are going to be able to stand it. Ana goes to much effort to steal back the nanomite Samsonite for her boss a Scottish arms dealer even though hes the guy who made the thing in the first place. He also keeps forgetting to check whether his babys LoJack is on and giving away his position. The Schmoes try to destroy Paris where Ana zooms around holding a weapon that looks like a Super Soaker with a lava lamp stuck to the end. Much of the time Duke is stuck to the roof of her SUV-like guano. His massive laser guns cant penetrate the cars armor so its lucky he brought along a really sophisticated weapon... a sword. Which slices through the SUV like its cutting into a boiled yam. The Joes are so obsessed with gadgets -- one suit makes them invisible another super-fast and impervious to attack from everything except film critics -- that they forget to tell the rest of Earth what theyre doing. You might think France would be interested to know that theres a plot to turn Paris into French toast. (After which we learn in a scene with the US president played by Jonathan Pryce that ""the French are very upset."") Soon were under the polar ice cap with Duke a captive to the Schmoes. Youd think theyd keep him in handcuffs or something. Coming to his rescue the Joes gain entrance to the Schmo control room by sticking another sword in a security panel have their martial-arts guy (Snake Eyes) face off in long irrelevant battles with his Schmo foe (Storm Shadow) and do their best to prevent the Schmoes from destroying the world -- although the scheme turns out to be an irrelevant distraction and the movie ends with nothing resolved. This is the kind of film where baddies say ""Now you die"" where friends say ""You almost lost your life out there -- you have a reason to be concerned"" and where gruff leaders growl ""Lets do this.""

Inspired by a line of stirringly patriotic 60s action figures produced by the mastermind behind the Transformers and Doom movies and directed by Stephen Sommers (Van Helsing) the film promised to be the runt in 2009s blockbuster litter. Which only proves that in Hollywood as in sport and politics lowered expectations can often be a blessing in disguise. If GI Joe had hit our the screens last year alongside The Dark Knight and Iron Man it might have struggled to make an impact. But coming on the heels of Wolverine and Terminator Salvation it feels like a welcome blast of fresh air.The set-up is essentially Team America played (fairly) straight in the near future a hi-tech team of globe-trotting crimefighters the best of the best from every NATO member country are pitched against the deadly forces of Christopher Ecclestons murderous Scottish arms dealer McCullen (of the clan McCullen natch). Our heroes include Channing Tatums walking brooding buzzcut Duke Marlon Wayans in full-on Goofy Black Sidekick mode as Ripcord and Dennis Quaid kicking ass and taking names as squad commander Hawk. The plot is little more than a 12 year olds action-movie wishlist wiseacre heroes? Check. Foxy leather-clad babes? Check. Wholesale destruction of international landmarks? Check. Scarred uber-villain with underwater base and access to world-threatening weapons technology? Check check and check. But its all put together with such verve and invention that resistance becomes futile the climactic sequence a globe-spanning pitched battle on five fronts involving ninjas nanobots and a fighter jet that speaks Gaelic is nothing short of breathtaking. GI Joe is big dumb loud and utterly relentless basically everything you could ever want from a summer blockbuster.

The F/X are relentless the acting is god-awful (et tu Dennis Quaid?) the one-liners are corny and it goes on forever. Worst of all the rah-rah teen-targeted flick fetishizes shiny military weaponry to such a degree that it feels like a really expensive (and really irresponsible) recruitment ad.

Joe The Rise of Cobra Richard Kuipers 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr August 7 2009 | 0755AM PT Young auds should turn this futuristic military-themed pic into a significant worldwide hit. Playing more like a highlight reel from an established franchise than a movie intended to launch it ""G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra"" interrupts its barrage of CGI action for only the barest minimum of anything resembling character development. Still young auds switched on to precisely this sort of entertainment should turn this futuristic military-themed pic into a significant worldwide hit and help toy company Hasbro -- also suppliers of raw materials for the ""Transformers"" films -- to its second merchandizing bonanza of the summer. Paramounts unwillingness to screen for critics however suggests something less than confidence in its big-budget investment. Launched in 1964 as a series of plastic military figures and reworked in comic and cartoon form any number of times since the G.I. Joe team underwent its most significant transformation in 1983 when its ranks of U.S. personnel expanded to include elite soldiers from around the globe. The screenplay by Stuart Beattie David Elliot and Paul Lovett sticks to that path with Uncle Sams representatives at the forefront of a multicultural crew on what is always referred to as an international mission. In the not-too-distant future regular Army buddies Duke (Channing Tatum) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) are transporting a deadly weapon capable of ""eating"" buildings and even whole cities thats been manufactured by Scottish arms magnate McCullen (Christopher Eccleston). Intending to steal his own device and hold the world to ransom McCullen a member of the evil organization Cobra dispatches private army superfighters Storm Shadow (South Korean superstar Byung-hun Lee) a ninja dressed in natty white threads and the Baroness (Sienna Miller) Dukes ex-g.f. who favors slinky leather jumpsuits. Rescued by mysterious strangers Duke and Ripcord are whisked off to a facility deep below the Sahara desert where after being put through some mildly amusing training hoops theyre accepted into the G.I. Joe ranks by old-school commander Gen. Hawk (Dennis Quaid). Given just enough time to establish name rank and specialist skill are squad members Snake Eyes (Ray Park) a silent type; Scarlett (Rachel Nichols) a crossbow-wielding brainiac; and Breaker (Said Taghmaoui) whos a whiz with electronics. Edited as if the audience wouldnt watch unless every scene were switched to overdrive the not-bad basic plot never gets much of a chance to be anything more. Not helping is the way in which uninspired flashbacks to the characters pasts arrive like commercial breaks slotted into what seems to one long setpiece. As helmed by Stephen Sommers (""The Mummy"" franchise ""Van Helsing"") the pic expectedly packs some eye-popping sights and a nifty collection of gadgets and gizmos. Best of the bunch is the Stan Winston Studio-created ""accelerator suit"" allowing the G.I Joe squad to sprint around Paris at 40 miles per hour and destroy half the city while attempting to save it from McCullens attack. While thesping is not the main game here having a cast of bright young things certainly helps and Quaid gets in a few nice John Wayne-like moments as the no-nonsense boss. Widescreen visuals are OK though some effects finishing looks rushed. When it can be heard over the cacophony of sound effects Alan Silvestris score hits the right notes. Other technical aspects are on the mark. G.I.
