A modern immorality tale with a keen observant edge ""Primary Colors"" can hardly help but fascinate as an exceedingly rare example of a film a clef. Frequently funny wonderfully performed eerily evocative of recent history and gratifyingly blunt in its assessment of what it takes to get to the top in modern American politics pic also lacks something crucial at its center that prevents it from being an entirely credible portrait of its subject. Speculation about the films commercial prospects has rightly centered on a number of highly unpredictable factors including the publics customary aversion to political movies the burnout factor on the subject of presidential scandals and a suspicion that recent history may have outstripped everything on view here. But curiosity John Travoltas star power heavy press coverage on and off the entertainment pages and fact that the film is undeniably entertaining should propel it to hefty domestic grosses; foreign outlook is less encouraging. Mike Nichols and Elaine May have made a shrewd adaptation of the ""Anonymous"" bestselling 1996 novel about the first Clinton presidential campaign. Although the filmmakers have taken every precaution to label their work fiction what they have in fact wrought would seem to represent a rare instance of a major feature film so closely mirroring the behavior of contemporary players on the national scene that audiences will more or less accept it as the truth even if cosmetic details have been altered. The very audacity of this gesture is itself impressive and the sense that one is watching only slightly distorted doubles for the genuine articles casts a peculiar and at times unnerving spell. Coming from Nichols and May one might have expected a more sustained satiric treatment of the political process and unseemly shenanigans indulged in by the presidential candidate and his inner circle. But while they cant resist the impulse to poke fun at their characters peccadilloes they have clearly been more drawn to using the opportunity to seriously assess and at times lament the course of American electoral politics and the contorted standards by which aspirants for office are judged embraced or cast aside. Opening scenes are near-brilliant in their precise focus and nuanced layering. After a vastly amusing demonstration of the candidates assortment of hand-shaking styles attention settles upon Gov. Jack Stanton (Travolta) from an unspecified Southern state as he promotes his interest in adult literacy by sitting in with some minority students in New York. After listening to a black man affectingly recount his shame over his underachieving academic career Stanton weighs in with a moving narrative about his own illiterate uncle. When Stantons story is shortly revealed privately as a crock the politicians ability to be simultaneously empathetic sincere inspirational cynical and mendacious is revealed in a stroke and when the followup scene casually shows that Stantons hidden agenda all along was to have a quickie with the classs pratfalling female teacher the film indicates its potential as a densely textured portrait of a supremely persuasive manipulator of everyone who enters his sphere of influence. Facing his first public hurdle on the road to the Democratic nomination the New Hampshire primary Stanton succeeds in convincing the skeptical Henry Burton (Adrian Lester) the bright grandson of a great civil rights pioneer to become his deputy campaign manager. Taking charge of a motley bunch of amateur workers this young black man becomes satisfied that the warm enthusiastic Stanton really does care about the people that he believes in something that his election will change history in a favorable manner. Invaluable to Stanton are his attractive and bracingly frank wife Susan (Emma Thompson) who manages to be amazingly effective in her public support of her husband even when he behaves in the most lowdown ways and his close adviser Richard Jemmons (Billy Bob Thornton) a self-proclaimed redneck who doesnt miss a trick when it comes to grabbing a competitive advantage but bluntly identifies his bosss Achilles heel ""The woman thing thats the killer."" As the battle of New Hampshire which occupies the films first 80 minutes heats up Stanton and his staff have to contend with several threatening (and curiously familiar) charges notably an arrest during a Vietnam War protest and subsequent string-pulling to expunge it from the record and allegations of adultery centering on some tape recordings purportedly revealing an affair between Stanton and his wifes former hairdresser. In order to dig up all the dirt before anyone else does the team brings in an old friend of the family and chief of staff the tenacious Libby Holden (Kathy Bates) a sassy upfront lesbian who knows where all the bodies are buried or has ways of finding out. Navigating through all the treacherous reefs and shoals the initially little-known candidate performs well in debates and closes his campaign with a highly effective appearance before some out-of-work maritime union members. Remaining hour takes Stanton through Florida with a side trip to New York. When the candidate who beat him in New Hampshire drops out of the race after a heart attack and is replaced by an honorable old party veteran Gov. Fred Picker of Florida (Larry Hagman) Holden dives in to identify the ugly skeleton in his closet. How the Stantons will use her findings however will determine for her if they are still the idealists she came to love so many years before or whether they have instead become ruthless rationalizing politicians like everyone else. Nichols conveys all this with deft incisive strokes never letting his or the viewers attention stray far from the essentials even as he keeps many balls in the air and continually reinforces his central themes in varied and subtle ways. At the same time the detail work is uncanny his trademark touch for the telling character trait ever in evidence. Travoltas warmth and expansiveness effectively amplify and embellish the likable and personable side of Stanton. Its easy to see in the stars enthusiastic performance why people quickly warm to Stanton and how hes able to charm cajole and seduce so many of those who cross his path. But because the actor with his salt-and-pepper crop of hair somewhat paunchy physique and soft raspy voice has been able so uncannily to impersonate the real President one is also forcibly reminded of what is missing from his characterization. And that is to be blunt intellectual distinction the Rhodes Scholar side to the man the voracious craving for knowledge and insight that when linked with his not-unrelated physical appetites and ambition can represent the first step toward an understanding of a man of such accomplishment. Without it Travoltas Stanton is too much just a Southern hick with an unusual common touch. With curiosity high as to how offensive the Stanton characterization might be to Clinton himself one could easily imagine that the absence of his obvious intelligence rather than the inclusion of any of his flaws would represent the most grievous insult. Serving as the viewers window onto the hardball court of take-no-prisoners politics Henry Burton is a cleverly conceived character quietly but adroitly brought to life by British stage thesp Lester. Thompson does a bang-up job as the politicians wife whos nearly as good an actor as her husband Thornton is dead-on as the crafty James Carville equivalent and Bates would steal every scene shes in if the other actors werent as good as they are. In contrast to the high-powered leading performers Tierney and Hagman make strong impressions by underplaying. John Vargas dominates an intense scene as an ailing drug dealer who delivers damning testimony against Stantons opponent. Despite the disillusionment and cynicism ""Primary Colors"" depicts the film itself is not cynical nor is it an indictment. The picture which has a tremendous professional sheen actually ends satisfyingly on a note of cautious optimism however couched it may be in a rueful awareness of the cost in tattered beliefs and ruined lives that Stantons journey has tallied.

"Primary Colors | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; primary-colors ) Primary Colors (United States 1998) A movie review by James Berardinelli It would be possible to write pages and pages comparing and contrasting the reality of Bill Clintons 1992 Presidential campaign with the fictional one of Jack Stanton the candidate in Primary Colors. Likewise it would be equally possible to develop a lengthy piece about the similarities and differences between the movie and the best-selling novel upon which it is based. Since more qualified individuals than I will be penning articles of this sort over the next few days and weeks I feel confident that I can narrow the scope of this review (mostly) to the movie itself and let others worry about the divisions between fact and fiction. Of course its impossible not to note that many of the characters in the film bear a striking resemblance to certain counterparts in the Clinton camp. Equally noteworthy is the fact that the movie dopplegangers are portrayed more kindly than their respective book incarnations. This is partially the result of the direction in which director Mike Nichols (The Graduate The Birdcage) has chosen to take the film. Joe Kleins novel (which he published under the ""Anonymous"" pseudonym) is a cynical satire of life on the campaign trail. Its harsh blistering and possesses an edge that the film a warmhearted comedy/drama lacks. And while the motion picture still makes some rather uncomfortable points about the sacrifices of virtue necessary to win an election its approach is much gentler than that of the book or for that matter another recent movie Wag the Dog or the documentary The War Room. Theres merit in briefly running through the films major characters and identifying their real-life counterparts if only to satisfy the curiosity of those who have seen the picture and arent sure. Jack and Susan Stanton (John Travolta and Emma Thompson) are of course Bill and Hillary Clinton. The movies central figure whose soul becomes a battleground between politics and idealism is Henry Burton (Adrian Lester) a black version of George Stephanopoulos. Richard Jemmons (Billy Bob Thornton) a plain-speaking spin doctor is obviously James Carville. Campaign adviser Daisy Green (Maura Tierney) represents Mandy Grunwald and dirt-digger Libby Holden (Kathy Bates) exhibits similarities to Betsey Wright. Theres also a Gennifer Flowers-type named Cashmire McLeod (Gia Carides) and a Paul Tsongas stand-in Lawrence Harris (Kevin Cooney). In a nutshell the film follows a Democratic presidential candidate from the early days of his campaign when hes preparing for the New Hampshire primary to the vanquishing of his final opponent. Governor Jack Stanton who is charisma personified wins over voters as a result of his relaxed manner apparent empathy with his audience and refreshingly open approach. (""Im gonna do something really outrageous -- tell the truth"" he declares at one point. The irony of that statement Im sure is not lost on anyone.) But Jack has a number of skeletons in his closet many of which are associated with sexual indiscretions and his advisors work overtime to keep them concealed. Not everything in Primary Colors is stripped from the historical account of Clinton 92. One of the key players in the film Fred Picker (Larry Hagman) the ""miracle candidate"" has no real-life counterpart. In addition much of what transpires during the closing half-hour has little or no basis in fact. Its purely Kleins invention as filtered through Elaine Mays script. Likewise the resolution of the Cashmire McLeod situation is radically different from how things turned out with Gennifer Flowers. However while the film is smart and perceptive in its take on American politics its dramatically weak. Nichols frequently seems caught in a palpable quandary is this a satire a drama or a cautionary tale? Because Primary Colors vacillates uncertainly between the three its not strong as any of them. Theres also a question of whether Nichols and May have softened the book to avoid appearing too critical of the President. Is Primary Colors an attack a retreat or an apology? My biggest complaint about the film is the length. At 140 minutes its too long with several sequences that border on becoming tedious. I also found Burtons constant moral struggles to be more irksome than believable. Maybe Im just too cynical but I have trouble accepting that someone that deep in the political process would be beset by so many doubts. (This incidentally was one of my complaints about The American President.) Humanizing a character is one thing but making him too noble especially in a movie that has a satirical basis can be problematic. And while the parallels between real individuals and fictional characters are interesting they cant sustain a feature-length motion picture on their own. Some of the problems inherent in adapting a book for the screen are evident as well. Many crucial relationships (such as the one between Burton and Green) are left half-developed (we see the two in bed but never really understand how they got to that point or where they go afterwards). Likewise two-thirds of the way through Green disappears with only a single-line write-out. Its difficult to say where these elements were molded into their current form (i.e. in the screenwriting process or in the editing room) but considering some of what survived in the final print it makes for an uneven viewing experience. With one important exception the performances are on-target. Travolta is wonderful as the Bill Clintonesque Stanton with a Southern accent white hair a pot belly and a boatload of charisma. Emma Thompson effectively shedding her British accent creates a wonderfully human Susan who loves her husband but erects an emotional shield to ward off being torn apart by his indiscretions. Billy Bob Thornton like James Carville is a scene-stealer as is Kathy Bates. Solid support is provided by Maura Tierney Larry Hagman and Stacy Edwards (In the Company of Men) as Holdens ""assistant."" Unfortunately I wasnt impressed by Adrian Lesters work and since the movie is presented from his perspective this is a serious drawback. Lester frequently seems stiff and his performance is occasionally forced. I was constantly aware that this is an actor playing a part not a fully fleshed-out character. It will be interesting to see whether the fortuitous timing of this release boosts the box office numbers. While theres nothing in the film that relates specifically to the recent allegations surrounding the Presidents sex life there are at least as many parallels as in Wag the Dog. Jack Stanton is after all a noble sincere man who genuinely wants to do good but is impeded by an overactive libido. And as Klein will acknowledge (but Nichols and May will not) any coincidences are purely intentional.

Starring John Travolta Emma Thompson and Adrian Lester. Directed by Mike Nichols. (R. 135 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Primary Colors"" is a movie about Bill Clinton pure and simple. Its not a study of the American system or the American soul. Disregard all the prerelease propaganda from director Mike Nichols and others associated with the picture. John Travoltas look and manner -- the graying hair the gravelly Southern voice the swagger -- are not meant merely to suggest President Clinton but flatly to imitate him. The story is a lightly fictionalized highly recognizable version of Clintons 1992 presidential campaign. ""Primary Colors"" based on Anonymous Joe Kleins novel of the same name is nothing more or less than a character study. Its opening today comes at an odd time. Everyone is discussing the very issues of presidential character and behavior that the film depicts. That helps the movie but hurts it too Filmed last summer and fall before Monica Lewinskys and Kathleen Willeys allegations hit the news ""Primary Colors"" seems about six months behind the story. Southern governor Jack Stanton is presented here as a womanizing rogue. A few months ago depicting a sitting president in such a way might have been considered daring. Blame Clinton or special prosecutor Kenneth Starr but these past months have seen the bar lowered. With allegations of sexual assault perjury and obstruction of justice swirling about the president ""womanizing rogue"" practically sounds warm and fuzzy. So ""Primary Colors"" as directed by Nichols and written by Elaine May emerges as a sneaky Clinton apologia. Recent history leaves it open to the charge of naivete but no matter. It is nonetheless an intelligent movie that offers the titillation of seeing the mighty portrayed without reverence. This is provocative entertainment with a distinct point of view that will launch after-movie discussions and arguments all over the country. The film takes the ambiguous elements of Kleins novel and slants them in a subtly favorable direction. For example though in the novel Stanton was a political opportunist whose true convictions were a mystery the film gives us a man who despite his foibles has a sincere desire to serve the common people. That fundamentally changes the tenor of the tale. Like the book the picture follows young Henry Burton (Adrian Lester) the grandson of a great civil rights leader. Henry a kind of black George Stephanopoulos has to decide whether to let himself be seduced into helping Stanton get elected. But what in the book was a hard choice something akin to making a pact with the devil becomes an obvious decision in the movie. The first sight of Travolta transformed into Clinton comes with a comic jolt. He feels everyones pain stuffs his face with doughnuts and spareribs and blinks back tears at every sad story. He stares fervently into peoples eyes as they talk -- not like a man whos listening but like someone who wants a reputation as a good listener. COMEDY BECOMES DRAMA The send-up only seems wicked. ""Primary Colors"" is not a satire like ""Wag the Dog."" It is a comedy about a presidential candidate and his advisers experiencing the highs and lows of a national campaign. It takes a wrong turn into drama two- thirds of the way through. For those who remember the 1992 primary season its deja vu all over again though the movie tilts things in its heros favor. Before the New Hampshire primary a former lover of Stantons tells all to a tabloid -- but wait it turns out their taped phone conversations were faked. Many remember the way Clinton campaigning in Florida misrepresented saintly Paul Tsongas policies on Israel and Social Security. Here the candidate agonizes before ""going negative."" Figuring out who is who is one of the films pleasures. Billy Bob Thornton plays Richard Jemmons a stand-in for Clinton campaign manager James Carville but Thorntons low-key performance doesnt nearly do justice to the fierce and fiery prototype. Jerry Brown who came close to stopping the Clinton juggernaut in the New York primary is the main inspiration for former Florida Governor Freddy Picker (Larry Hagman). Picker becomes Stantons greatest threat by employing an unheard-of political strategy He speaks from his gut and answers questions honestly. The movie loses something by downplaying the books arresting contrast between Stantons smooth dishonesty and Pickers raw sincerity. Emma Thompsons portrayal of the candidates wife Susan Stanton is bound to be talked about. She doesnt imitate Hillary Rodham Clinton but plays Susan as a hard- driving executive a full partner in the campaign. Some may find it undignified to see a Hillaryesque character drop to her knees and sob when she finds out that her husband has once again betrayed her. But ""Primary Colors"" is respectful enough to present the Stantons marriage as a real one. MORAL DILEMMA MINIMIZED Travoltas performance gets lost in his Clinton imitation. The emotional anchors of the film are Thompson and Kathy Bates who plays a loud and flashy but painfully vulnerable Stanton operative. Lester is convincing as the idealistic young aide Henry but would have been better served had the script not minimized the moral dilemma in supporting a man he knows is a liar. ""Dont you think Abe Lincoln was a whore before he became president?"" Stanton asks Henry. In fact Lincoln was never a whore but the remark contains the truth according to ""Primary Colors.""

The camera noses in tight on a pair of meaty white hands warmly grasping the hands and arms and shoulders of strangers. Then it pulls back slowly teasingly to reveal the face of the man pressing the flesh Its John Travolta playing Southern governor and presidential candidate Jack Stanton a character closely modeled on then-Arkansas governor and 1992 presidential candidate Bill Clinton. Travoltas eyes pool with Clintonian dew he smiles with Clintonian good feeling his hair is grayed and feathered into Clintons distinctive just-stepped-out-of-a-salon do and his body is pillowy just like the avoirdupois of the factual man on whom the fiction is based. What a giddy celebrity-morphing moment John Travolta as Jack Stanton as Bill Clinton is one of those thrilling confluences in pop culture a blurring of politics entertainment and newspaper headlines that titillates and rewards audiences for thinking the worst about politicians and the best about movie stars. After a week in which no less establishment a publication than The New York Times printed excerpts from a legal deposition in which the President of the United States of America was interrogated under oath as to whether he ever asked a certain woman to kiss his penis Primary Colors is just what this country needs two-plus hours of entertainment for which none of us are required to buy the plot as gospel truth or reject it as a pack of lies. Its a stretch of time during which yall can put aside conversation about genitals and just enjoy Travoltas gusto. Primary Colors isnt nearly as real a deal as the 1993 documentary The War Room; ultimately its mighty inconsequential a series of wry skits on themes of appetites and campaign fever. But heck its only a movie not a disquisition or a defense or an indictment of current events. Its fiction with a snappy cast of characters who thanks to a sharp-tongued script by the ferociously witty Elaine May get in some gratifying zingers. Itll do for diversion. And anyone who worries any deeper about it - studio execs or political advisers Clinton supporters or detractors - needs to take up a hobby. The movie is of course based on the book of the same name by the author formerly known as Anonymous now known to be political journalist Joe Klein. But this adaptation has been directed by Mays smooth old compatriot in comedy Mike Nichols. And those two veterans have played with the focus a bit. Kleins story is still filtered through the experience of a preppy black campaign staffer (Adrian Lester a Brit cast for no particular reason I can see except that as an unknown in America he can most easily play the omniscient blank of a narrator) whose eyes are open to the ways of power loyalty temptation pragmatism and ethical hairsplitting on the campaign trail. But now the story is even more tellingly about the tantalizing compartmentalized personality of the charming weaselly candidate. And now Stantons closest advisers - including his wife (Emma Thompson wrestling manfully with an American accent) his political strategist (Billy Bob Thornton in great form) his brash lesbian all-purpose troubleshooter and bluntest truth teller (Kathy Bates in another outsize character role) and assorted additional operatives - more clearly orbit his warm gaseous celestial self like moons. Travolta has got this fractured soul down beautifully. (Nichols takes a scene in which the candidate decompresses from bimbo eruptions by engaging in quiet conversation with a doughnut-shack counterman and invests it with the holy intimacy of religious communion Stanton worshipping at the shrine of Saint Cruller.) But the most surprisingly moving supporting player may well be Larry Hagman as Gov. Fred Picker (a less eccentric Ross Perot may come to mind). As an infinitely decent fellow who enters the presidential race late and appears to be unstoppable unless Stantons team can unearth something to trip him up Hagman damn near glows with serenity and purpose and Nichols skillfully shoots every Picker scene to a slower metronome beat. In the syncopated rhythms of Stantons morally chaotic pace and Pickers statesmanlike amble lies a really deep and subtle political story. But thats for another movie another administration another time when the special prosecuting is over and presidential gravitas is once again in fashion.
