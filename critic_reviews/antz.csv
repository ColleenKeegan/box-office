Low concept or what? CGI allows Woody Allen to play Z-4195 a neurotic worker ant unhappy with his lot. A chance encounter with a slumming Princess Bala (voiced by Stone) leads Z into an impetuous uniform switch with his soldier friend Weaver (Stallone) just as scheming General Mandible (Hackman) engineers a kamikaze war against the termites. Visually striking and dynamically shot this has strong characters and no shortage of incident. Even so parents may enjoy it more than their children. Most of the humour springs from the whiny cowardly Z and will probably go over younger heads. Dramatic empathy similarly derives largely from adult concerns romantic attraction career disenchantment the dawning of political consciousness. Call it angst. The politics are the single most intriguing aspect the colony functions as a quasi-fascist totalitarian state. Zs rebellion is at first a blow for individual liberty but later assumes a social dimension. Unsurprisingly the movie ultimately advocates a benign enlightened oligarchy. At times the film really is as lumpen as this makes it sound. But the trip to Insectopia sticks in the mind as the one sequence that matches Toy Storys inspiration and existential wit.

Voices by Woody Allen Sharon Stone Gene Hackman Sylvester Stallone Jennifer Lopez Danny Glover Dan Aykroyd. Directed by Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson. (PG. 93 minutes.) ""Antz"" is a humongous animation event that ratchets up the level of computer art that Hollywood is swooning over these days. Whether it will lift the hearts of children usually the core audience for animation features is another matter. The dense and sophisticated ""Antz"" out on video is foremost a good Woody Allen comedy. With Allen voicing the main character Z the film is full of neurotic energy. Its a little surprising that this computer-generated feature from the West Coasts DreamWorks -- created at Palo Altos Pacific Data Images -- is so Allenesque. The filmmakers seem to have deliberately snubbed the traditional audience for animated features. Can 8-year- olds possibly relate to an opening sequence in which Z talks in nervous tones to his therapist? Teens and adults however will latch on to the films urbane wit relishing the focus on a lowly worker ant with an obsessive drive to change his status. ""Antz"" is a milestone of animation complexity. Despite some visual sameness it cleverly contrasts a vast underground world with the larger one under the sun and deftly keeps a love story alive amid political crisis. The story is all romantic-adventure comedy. The restless Z breaks out of his stifling situation by trading places with Weaver (voiced by Sylvester Stallone) Zs buddy and a hunky warrior whod rather be a worker. Ordered into battle Z emerges as a war hero and this gets big attention from love interest Princess Bala (voice of Sharon Stone) with whom Z ultimately flees the colony. The film strikes creative gold with a sequence in which Z and Bala encounter the giant world of humans. They get stepped on by a kid but cling to a piece of gum on the bottom of his shoe as he runs through a park. The action is shown from their point of view and its a gem.

Allen plays a klutzy malcontent worker ant named Z who wonders whether the key to his existential malaise is that hes ""a middle child in a family of 5 million."" Z dreams of a fabled aboveground Eden called Insectopia and he confides his wanderlust to his soldier-ant buddy Weaver (Sylvester Stallone). Like Allen himself -- who in Antz turns in a performance more winning than anything hes done since Hannah and Her Sisters -- Zs schlemiel-style shtick wins over the unlikeliest of celebrities. Indeed he charms the antennae off the colonys bored princess Bala (Sharon Stone whose comedic skills have heretofore been underutilized) whos less than thrilled about her engagement to the fascistic General Mandible (Gene Hackman). Together Z and Bala risk their lives to check out Insectopia; to organize a worker rebellion against terrible conditions; and having gotten in touch with their ""inner maggots"" to thwart Mandibles dastardly plan (establishing a new world order by flushing out the weak) and lead the masses to a brave new world of discarded sodas and rotting food. Its probably dangerous to read too much political theory into this terrific production elegantly directed by Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson from a clever script by Todd Alcott Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz. So lets say there is no parallel between this fantasy (so inviting that younger viewers will enjoy the broader bug jokes so sly that adults will think of brilliant Jay Ward cartoons) and the story of DreamWorks founders who struck out on their own the animation expert among them -- Jeffrey Katzenberg -- having rebelled against the Disney colony. Lets say instead that on one level Antz celebrates a healthy leftist balance of individual initiative and cooperative teamwork. On another level the movie is about the apolitical joys of perspective busting something the modern artists and technical geniuses of animation can now do to perfection Z and Bala on their outdoor jaunt fall into the sugary vastness of a doughnut and get stuck on acres of chewing gum wadded to the bottom of a sneaker; Z climbs a shoelace like its the Empire State Building. Too Antz is about the fun of creative free association Z meets two lockjawed wasps -- so very WASPy played by Jane Curtin and Dan Aykroyd; General Mandible poses in a stance out of Patton; workers rallying in support of their hero chant ""All we are saying is give Z a chance"" etc. Finally Antz is about the relief felt by star actors freed from the constraints of their physical selves and the egos that go with them. Who knew that in playing a bug Woody Allen could so effectively crawl away from his current creepy reputation as a human?

This initial collaboration between DreamWorks and partial subsid Pacific Data Images reps just the second fully computer- animated feature to be released after ""Toy Story"" and while this new effort doesnt possess the potential to match the levels of Disneys 1995 CGI blockbuster its considerable appeal should translate into a long and healthy B.O. life. ""Antz"" is a dazzling delight. This initial collaboration between DreamWorks and partial subsid Pacific Data Images reps just the second fully computer- animated feature to be released after ""Toy Story"" and while this new effort doesnt possess the potential to match the levels of Disneys 1995 CGI blockbuster its considerable appeal should translate into a long and healthy B.O. life. The commercial question marks relate to the slightly sophisticated nature of the story non-kid-related characters and the ability of the Woody Allen-voiced lead character to click with the sort of wide audience the comic auteur has never before reached. A sort of ""Metropolis"" meets ""Microcosmos"" with a commoner-princess lovers-on-the-run romance at its core ""Antz"" is beating to market by seven weeks Disneys computer animated ""A Bugs Life"" which reput-edly has a very similar insect-centered storyline but also boasts original Randy Newman songs and is allegedly more child-friendly. No company has yet cracked Disney hegemony in the animated field and it will be interesting to see how this latest chapter in the war plays out. On its own terms ""Antz"" is fresh and inventive visually stimulating and extremely well-served by a starry cast largely new to the animation field. Appropriately enough for a feature toplining Allen the picture starts on an analysts couch as a meek worker ant named Z complains about his upbringing as ""the middle child in a family of 5 million"" and kvetches about his feelings of insignificance in the giant ant colony only to be told by the shrink ""You are insignificant."" Slinking off to his job digging a giant new tunnel Z commiserates with his amiable co-worker Azteca (Jennifer Lopez) who accepts her lot in life as a tiny cog in the enormous construct that is ant civilization. The physical grandeur of this underground totalitarian world is dazzlingly displayed in the early going as countless workers are driven to extremes by Gen. Mandible (Gene Hackman) a martinet with dreams of even greater glory and his aide de camp Col. Cutter (Christopher Walken). Mandible convinces his queen (Anne Bancroft) that the colony is threatened with imminent invasion by termites and that he must therefore launch a preemptive strike. On the night before the invasion the queens daughter Princess Bala (Sharon Stone) who is unhappily engaged to Mandible goes slumming in a bar to see what the simple folk do and asks an unsuspecting Z to dance. This triggers a vastly amusing episode in which to the strains of ""Guantanamera"" the pair dance with improvisatory glee against a backdrop of dozens of other ants moving about in coordinated conformity. On this night as well a bar drunk informs Z of an above-ground haven he calls Insectopia something the authorities predictably deny exists at all. So delirious is Z from his encounter with Bala that he convinces a friendly stalwart soldier Weaver (Sylvester Stallone) to let him take his place in the military review hoping this will allow him to see Bala once again. What this gets the cowardly imp is a place on the front lines where termites spew bile and chow down on ants while the latter assault and gore their gargantuan foes in a mild CGI version of ""Starship Troopers."" By a fluke the neurotic terrified Z is the only survivor of the massacre and he leaves the battlefield with the final words of a fallen friend ringing in his ears ""Dont follow orders all your life."" Despite being welcomed as a war hero back at the colony Z is threatened by Mandible and is more or less forced into kidnapping Princess Bala. Much of the remainder of the story takes place in the open air where the pair must elude Mandibles posses contend with the occasional human being and such manmade gear as sneakers and a flame-igniting magnifying glass and encounter the unlikely paradise of Insectopia falling in love all the while. Action climax precipitated by the megalomaniacal Mandibles betrayal of the colony returns matters underground. The humor in the script by Todd Alcott and Chris and Paul Weitz effectively counterbalances the potential silliness of a pro-individualist anti-automaton theme in an ant context. Allens distinctively harried delivery further helps and it comes as little surprise to learn that the actors were all videotaped as they recorded their dialogue so that the animated characters could assume some of their physical characteristic as they spoke and reacted. (Allen also futzed around with his dialogue to tailor it to his speaking patterns although he receives no writing credit.) At the same time it must be stressed that except for Stallones muscle-bound warrior the ants are not designed to resemble the actors voicing them which makes the romance between Allen and Stone not only possible but palatable. With the CGI technique nicely accommodating the hard surfaces of insect bodies the ants have a brown hue and expressive eyes that vaguely recall E.T. Even the sometimes jerky character movements seem appropriate to the arthropods while the backgrounds are magnificently designed with detail and bold clear colors that continually provide feasts for the eyes. Directors Eric Darnell a commercials vet well known for his animated short ""Gas Planet"" and Tim Johnson noted for his work on ""The Simpsons "" 1995 Halloween special ""Homer"" keep the picture moving at a lively but never hectic clip. Vocal performances are outstanding across the board with Allen and Stone proving to be most engaging leads Hackman and Stallone excelling as very different kinds of soldiers Lopez giving appealing blue-collar shadings to her worker ant and Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin spot-on as a snooty but loving wasp couple (in both senses of the term). The energetic and resourceful background score by Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell is abetted by several standards that are used in markedly witty ways. PG rating shouldnt suggest that there is anything remotely offensive in the picture only that some of its content might sail over the heads of kids younger than 7 or 8.

The battle of the bugs has begun. The first bug flick to crawl onto the big screen is DreamWorks ""Antz"" beating Disneys also-animated ""A Bugs Life"" to the box office by eight weeks. If you ever needed proof that all of Hollywood drinks from the same idea pool the last couple of years have provided ample evidence. Weve had battling volcano movies dueling earth-shattering asteroid movies and now a double bug invasion. Pauls Pix ""Antz"" Windows Media 28k or 56k Real 28k or 56k Theatrical preview ""Antz"" Windows Media 28k or 56k Real 28k or 56k Clip ""Digging is fun"" Video clip 2Mb QuickTime Both films are about one ant who saves the day---by saving his ant hill from disaster. But there are some major differences here. ""Antz"" is only the second film to be entirely done by computer animation. (The first was ""Toy Story."") ""A Bugs Life"" is done the old-fashioned way. Also ""A Bugs Life"" will be rated G and aimed directly at kids. The PG-rated ""Antz"" is filtered through the sensibilities of Woody Allen and is more or less an adult comedy from an ants point of view. Neuroses in an ant hill plain and simple ""Antz"" is being ballyhooed as a huge breakthrough in computer animation the first animated film from the newest studio on the block DreamWorks. And some of the biggest names in Hollywood are making their debut in a non-live action motion picture. But the real deal? This is a Woody Allen film plain and simple. Allen has just dragged his neuroses from the concrete canyons of Manhattan to a well-drawn ant hill. The part of Z the worker ant was written for Allen and it shows. Hes the middle child of a family of 5 million seeing a shrink and complaining about his father leaving when he was only a little larva. Hes also trying to get in touch with his inner maggot. Z is just not happy with his lot in life as a worker ant; he longs to break away from the crowd. Sharon Stone provides the voice of Princess Bala who isnt looking forward to her future either. Eventually shell become queen of the ant hill and be expected to pop out millions of baby ants. Together they leave the ant hill and seek out a paradise called Insectopia (actually a trash can near a picnic table in a public park). But trouble brews and Z is forced to return to the ant hill to save his family. All 5 million of them. Cast of stars Sylvester Stallone plays Weaver a soldier ant who is Zs best friend. Gene Hackman is the ambitious Gen. Mandible who is trying to take over the ant hill and rebuild it in his own image. Anne Bancroft is perfectly cast as the queen ant. Also providing vocals are Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtain as a couple of wasps as well as John Mahoney Danny Glover Jennifer Lopez and Christopher Walken. ""Antz"" is basically a straightforward story about individuality versus group conformity. Our hero Z is uncomfortable with the over-regimented world of his fellow ants and no one does uncomfortable better than Woody Allen. Overall ""Antz"" provides a nice little message about not being pigeonholed by society and that no matter what your station in life you can always do better if you believe in yourself. Allen provides plenty of comic relief and the computer-generated animation is pretty impressive. This is the season for big movies with grand themes. Can you spell Oscar? But if youre just looking for escapist entertainment with the minimal use of your brain cells ""Antz"" could do the trick. ""Antz"" is rated PG mainly due to some adult language with a running time of 83 minutes.

"Antz | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; antz ) Antz (United States 1998) A movie review by James Berardinelli In the Magic Kingdom they must be getting nervous. For years Disney has had a death grip on the animated market but as we enter the latter years of the 1990s the corporation that gave us Bambi and Snow White is finding their dominance challenged. Foxs Anastasia was actually better than last years Disney animated film Hercules. And now as the Mousketeers prepare the bring the computer-generated feature A Bugs Life to the screen Dreamworks has engineered a preemptive strike by launching its own computer-animated insect epic Antz two months earlier. Antz which had its world premiere on September 19 1998 as the Closing Gala Selection for the 23rd annual Toronto International Film Festival is a very good movie no matter how you look at it. Visually its more impressive than Disneys Toy Story the pioneer in this burgeoning genre. On a script level it was developed as much with a mature audience in mind as with the usual pre-pubescent crowd. A significant helping of Antzs humor will go over the heads of the average under-12 viewer. Image-conscious adults should not feel embarrassed about sitting through this ""kids movie."" The big-name vocal cast is expertly-selected. Where else can you find Woody Allen Sylvester Stallone Anne Bancroft Christopher Walken Sharon Stone and Gene Hackman in the same film? Antz follows the adventures of Z-4195 (Z for short) a neurotic worker ant whose voice is appropriately provided by Woody Allen. Z is in therapy because hes an individual in a colony where conformity is not only desirable but mandatory. Hes having trouble coming to grips with his insignificance and inadequacy. One night while at a bar he dances with Princess Bala (Sharon Stone) whos out incognito for a night of adventure. Z is immediately lovestruck and begins to plan a way to arrange another meeting with the princess. His scheme involves impersonating his friend Weaver (Sylvester Stallone) a soldier ant. Things go wrong however when the evil General Mandible (Gene Hackman) arranges for the ant army to attack a nearby colony of termites and Z finds himself in the midst of a battle. Surrounded by fierce fighters that look death in the face and laugh at it this timid worker whose preference is to ""make belittling comments and snicker behind deaths back"" does the only thing he can he hides. Adults and children alike will be awestruck by Antzs impressive production design. This animated effort has texture and depth. Great care is taken to make the inside of the colony a place of majestic spectacle and bustling activity. You can see this movie several times and still notice new things. The characters are wonderfully rendered with a complete gallery of facial expressions. Antz takes the visual strengths of Toy Story and improves upon them. Story-wise theres nothing here that is likely to confuse younger viewers. The basic plot is a cross between an adventure and a ""Taming of the Shrew"" romantic comedy. Or as Z puts it Antz is ""your basic boy meets girl boy likes girl boy changes underlying social structure"" tale. The dialogue is consistently smart and has not been diluted to enable underage audience members to comprehend every line. Most children arent going to understand Zs comment that a better alternative to war with the termites might be to ""try influencing their political process with campaign contributions"" but almost every adult in the theater will get a hearty laugh out of such an observation. A significant portion of Antzs comedy is like this. The characters despite their only vaguely humanoid appearance are instantly likable. Allen plays Z like an insect version of his well-established screen persona. Stones Bala is strong-willed and appealing with a hard side the emerges from time-to-time. Hackman is deliciously malevolent as a megalomaniacal general. And Sylvester Stallone is solid as Zs burly dim-but-loyal friend. Other voices include Christopher Walken as the generals second-in-command Anne Bancroft as the ant queen Dan Aykroyd as a snobbish yellowjacket and Jennifer Lopez as Weavers love interest. Its too early to compare Antz to A Bugs Life but for anyone who appreciates animated films (especially those of the computer-generated variety) the late months of 1998 promise a bumper crop. As the first production out of the gate Antz gets things off to a positive start. Successful as an adventure a surprisingly sophisticated comedy a light romance and a visual treat there are few things that Eric Darnell and Tim Johnsons feature debut does not do. If Disney is worried perhaps they have a reason to be. The bar has just been raised but not by them.

"Antz (PG) Related Items ""Antz"" showtimes Post questions to Michael OSullivan Thats Ant-ertainment By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday October 2 1998 Woody Allen voices the character of Z-4195 in ""Antz."" (DreamWorks SKG) Directors Eric Darnell; Lawrence Guterman Voices Woody Allen; Sharon Stone; Danny Glover; Sylvester Stallone; Jennifer Lopez; Gene Hackman; Anne Bancroft; Christopher Walken; Dan Aykroyd Running Time 1 hour 23 minutes Mild vulgarity and dead bugs I dont much care for bugs but the cartoon insects in ""Antz"" are a heck of a lot more entertaining than the ones that live under my kitchen sink. The delightful animated feature - a joint production of DreamWorks Pictures and special-effects house PDI - boasts not only a cast of millions but an adorably bug-eyed antihero (get it?) named Z-4195. If the whiny voice and anxious kvetching of this six-legged neurotic sound familiar they come courtesy of that walking bundle of tics Woody Allen. As Z Allen reprises his familiar shtick to great effect as he whines to his shrink (Paul Mazursky) in the films opening sequence about the injustices of life on the ant farm. An anonymous worker in the tunnel construction industry Z is unsatisfied because he doesnt like dirt and he doesnt quite get the whole concept of the ""superorganism thing"" - the philosophy that the colony is all that matters. Contributing to his psychosocial complex is the fact that his drone father left him when he was just an itty-bitty larva - the middle child in a family of 5 million - and furthermore hes never been able to lift more than 10 times his own weight. ""Congratulations"" says the therapist as the insignificant Z acknowledges his feelings of utter worthlessness. ""Youre making real progress."" Far be it from the spunky schlemiel to assimilate that easily into the teeming multitudes however. When he falls in love its not just with a fellow proletarian but with the lovely Princess Bala (Sharon Stone) a slumming aristocrat he meets one evening when she steps out for an aphid beer in the workers bar. In a hilarious sequence as row upon row of his robotic colleagues line-dance to a Muzak version of ""Guantanamera"" the free-wheeling Z and Bala shock the bug-oisie by dancing to a different drummer. If that iconoclastic behavior doesnt get him in enough trouble with the authorities the love-struck Z is soon conniving to trade places with his pal Weaver (Sylvester Stallone) a soldier ant who gives up his helmet so Z can infiltrate the military hoping to catch a glimpse of his beloved as the troops march past the royal reviewing stand. Too bad that General Mandible (Gene Hackman) a deranged officer who makes George S. Patton look like a milquetoast has just declared war on the neighboring termites. The preemptive strike is all part of his megalomaniacal plan to take over the world - or at least the local ant hill. Can Z survive the suicidal attack on an enemy five times the size of the average ant - one whose secret weapon is the ability to squirt acid from its forehead? Will he win the love of the fair maiden while leading the mass of downtrodden workers in a mini-Marxist revolution? And is there really such a place as Insectopia the fabled paradise of sour milk and rancid honey? Sorry stinging fire ants couldnt make me reveal the outcome of this witty and yes surprisingly suspenseful adventure. The story cleverly written by Todd Alcott and brothers Chris and Paul Weitz is an old-fashioned yarn about the triumph of individuality over conformity that taps into the universal desire to root for the underdog. As directed by Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson however this fantasia actually accomplishes what many live-action narratives fail to do It makes you care about its speck-sized characters. Thats all the more unusual given the fact that these animated ""Antz"" crawled out of a computer an all-too-often soulless tool known more for the technical high-wire acts it is capable of than it is for its emotional depth. As the 1995 ""Toy Story"" proved when you start with a good solid narrative coupled with the nuanced vocal interpretations of a well-chosen cast it matters little whether your protagonists are pixels pen and ink or real people.
