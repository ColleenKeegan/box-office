The film-makers have latched on to its mild scares teenage sleuthing and food-obsessed canine anti-hero with unpretentious affection. While the jaunty computer-generated Scooby doesnt wholly convince its fun seeing humans meld into the cartoon roles. Vapid poster-boy Prinze is all too credible as cravat-sporting self-proclaimed gangleader Fred; Gellar struggles to make flouncy Daphne more than a squealing damsel in distress; Cardellini plumbs unexpected depths of smart-girl resentment as bespectacled Velma; while Lillard is uncannily excellent as Shaggy down to the quavery vocal inflections dopey flower child sincerity and the telling instinct for pioneering sauce combinations. The plot? Well you dont go to a Scooby-Doo movie for the plot. After an acrimonious split the team reunite when theyre summoned by magnate Emile Mondavarious (Atkinson slippery but not quite sinister) to his Spooky Island resort where dark forces are turning visitors into soulless zombies.

In terms of B.O. potential however Warners release stands to surpass all predecessors in its subgenre. As live-action versions of TV cartoons go ""Scooby-Doo"" ranks quality-wise somewhere between the inspired satire of ""Josie and the Pussycats"" and the lumbering obviousness of the ""Flintstones"" films. In terms of B.O. potential however Warners release stands to surpass all predecessors in its subgenre with doggone impressive theatrical numbers and scooby-dooby-groovy ancillary biz. Despite slapdash nature of plotting and occasional confusion within individual action set pieces pic is just fast frenetic and funny enough to amuse both new fans and longtime devotees of the characters who have inspired more than 30 years worth of animated TV episodes and made-for-video features. Credit director Raja Gosnell (""Big Mamas House"" ""Never Been Kissed"") and his casting crew for spot-on matching of appealing live actors with familiar human characters. And praise the CGI team led by visual effects coordinator Peter Crosman for the virtually seamless blend of live action and animated wizardry that allows the actors to persuasively interact with Scooby-Doo the semi-heroic Great Dane with a distinctive speech impediment (Neil Fanning provides Scoobys voice) and an insatiable appetite for Scooby snacks. The interplay here between human beings and digitally created co-star is even more matter-of-factly remarkable than in many big-ticket sci-fi spectacles. The two-legged late-teen leads of the long-running cartoon series emerge pretty much unchanged on the bigscreen. Fred (Freddie Prinze Jr.) is the zestfully self-assured and unaccountably ascot-wearing leader of the detective team known as Mystery Inc. Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is a blond beauty with terrific fashion sense and an unfortunate tendency to be abducted by bad guys. Velma (Linda Cardellini) is the true brains of the outfit a bespectacled uber-nerd whos usually overshadowed by her flashier cohorts. And Shaggy (Matthew Lillard) Scooby-Doos best buddy is a scruffy slacker with a constant craving for junk food a blissfully self-absorbed worldview and an indefatigable readiness to run away from any and all danger. (For many viewers it was impossible to take Jan De Bonts overbearing 1999 remake of ""The Haunting"" at all seriously because it so closely resembled a traditional Scooby-Doo scenario and Owen Wilson was so obviously channeling the spirit of Shaggy.) Scripter James Gunn shrewdly begins with a knowing wink at the ""Scooby-Doo"" mythos by introducing Scooby and the rest of the Mystery Inc. gang at the climax of a typical adventure. The logic of movement and spatial relationships isnt always easy to follow here -- and the same unfortunately can be said of a few later action-adventure sequences -- but Gunn and Gosnell get the basics right by having our heroes rely on luck and pluck to unmask yet another fake ghost. Pamela Anderson makes an unbilled appearance as a toy-company owner whose business is saved by Mystery Inc. After the action however ""Scooby-Doo"" introduces an element of self-referential satire when the teammates are driven apart by jealousies and resentments Fred is a fatuous hunk who too-readily grabs credit for Mystery Inc. triumphs much to the consternation of the none-too-bright Daphne -- whos really really tired of always being the damsel in distress -- and the underappreciated Velma. Despite frantic efforts by Shaggy and Scooby-Doo to sustain the partnership their three partners in crime-solving break ranks and take off. Two years later however the team is reunited at Spooky Island a popular spring break hot spot with a haunted house theme. Resort owner Emile Mondavarious (Rowan Atkinson) claims Spooky Island may be infested with real non-f/x ectoplasms. Based on their past experiences of course the newly reunited Mystery Inc. members suspect a human hand behind the seemingly supernatural activity. (""Our area of expertise"" Fred notes ""is nut jobs in Halloween costumes."") But then again our heroes have never before been in a live-action movie that owes almost as much to ""Ghostbusters"" as it does to its cartoon source material. The plot has something to do with spirit-summoning ancient rituals and something else to do with training white-bread teens to talk in gangstaspeak. (One of the movies biggest laughs involves Freds incongruous use of homeboy patois.) For the most part though the plot is merely an excuse for the human actors and the CGI Scooby-Doo to dash through familiar motions with occasional flourishes of self-parody. Theres only one element that may disappoint faithful fans of the cartoon series Because they have to fly to Spooky Island the leads dont spend much time driving around in their familiar Mystery Machine van. The well-cast leads are nicely adroit at balancing satire and sincerity in their aptly cartoonish but pleasingly modulated performances. ""Scooby-Doo"" fans may be shocked and/or delighted to see that at long last Velma actually displays a bit of cleavage while wearing something other than her traditional sweater.) But Atkinson isnt given nearly enough to do in a role that could have used more over-the-top oomph and other supporting players -- including Miguel A. Nunez Jr. as a dubious voodoo practitioner and Isla Fisher as a cutie who falls for Shaggy -- are stuck with even thinner parts. As a Spooky Island guest who takes a shine to Velma Charles Cousins plays a character whos so underwritten he doesnt even get a name. In the credits hes simply listed as ""Velmas Friend."" On a tech level ""Scooby-Doo"" -- produced on location in Queensland Australia -- is first-rate across the board. Production designer Bill Boes does an especially fine job of evoking on screen the seriocomically scary look of the cartoon series settings. By the way Fans who never warmed to Scrappy-Doo the annoyingly pugnacious pooch who was introduced late in the cartoon series will have reason to rejoice. The little twerp finally gets what he deserves here. Scooby-DooProductionA Warner Bros. Release of a Mosaic Media Group production. Produced by Charles Roven Richard Suckle.

USATODAY.com - Rut-ro New Scooby-Doo doesnt do it Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 06/13/2002 - Updated 0941 PM ET Rut-ro New Scooby-Doo doesnt do it By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Heres a classic example of a movie that didnt need to be made. Sure some remakes of popular cartoons hit big at the box office. Casper is one The Flintstones another. But let us not forget such resounding flops as Josie and the Pussycats and The Adventures of Rocky amp; Bullwinkle. If you were a fan of the cartoon series you would be better off in front of a smaller screen in your own home watching Scooby and friends tackle their assignments. Not that the TV show was so riveting but most of the half-hour plots were more compelling than this lackluster warmover. Read more below Interview Scooby-Doo talks about his acting style salary Trailer View the trailer for Scooby-Doo Video Clip See a clip from Scooby-Doo The movie opens with the crime-fighting mystery-solving quintet (Shaggy Scooby-Doo Fred Daphne and Velma) going their separate ways fed up that the foppish Fred got all the glory for their work. A few years later each is called back for one assignment to solve the mystery of why every teen who goes to Spooky Island theme park emerges a brainwashed alien cult member. Scooby-Doo (out of four) Stars Freddie Prinze Jr. Sarah Michelle Gellar Matthew Lillard Linda Cardellini Director Raja Gosnell Distributor Warner Bros. Rating PG for some rude humor language and scary action The computer-generated Great Dane is cute and his voice is reminiscent of the TV cartoon (with a broader vocabulary). But his human pals with the exception of Matthew Lillards Shaggy are more one-dimensional than their animated counterparts. Lillard brings his spacey ultra-mellow cartoon character to life and seems to be having more fun than his cohorts. One can believe that this guy likes munching on Scooby snacks as much as his pooch does -- though one wonders what those snacks are laced with. In fact theres a marijuana joke that seems to have been shoehorned in for the over-12 set. Linda Cardellini so effective in Freaks and Geeks captures the brainy Velma better than her bigger-name co-stars Freddie Prinze Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar handle Fred and Daphne. Granted Fred is a vapid character. Why else would he be known for his ascots and little else? But Prinze brings him no charisma appearing to be just going through the motions. Gellar is a simpering ditz who finally gets some brawn by the movies end. She looks like shes aping a 1960s Nancy Sinatra in her boots and minis but the movie is set in the present day. Its unclear why the writers bothered to update the cartoon unless it was to expand the possibilities for quips and jokey ideas. If so they failed in their mission as the movie elicits few laughs. Do scoot away from Scooby. Do.

Starring Freddie Prinze Jr. Sarah Michelle Gellar Matthew Lillard Linda Cardellini and Rowan Atkinson. Directed by Raja Gosnell. Written by James Gunn. (PG. 87 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Two schools of thought will undoubtedly emerge about the big-screen version of ""Scooby-Doo"" Those who say its a logical extension of the televised cartoon show that has captivated kids since 1969 and those who say its the latest sign of Hollywoods desperation to mine popular cartoon characters for cinematic profit. The first camp will see ""Scooby-Doo"" as a fun innocuous way to spend 87 minutes while the other camp will say its a sappy formulaic vehicle that exists to spawn sequels and merchandise. In which camp is this reviewer? For now lets just say this If you focus solely on the films acting you come away somewhat satisfied that Matthew Lillard (who plays the Shaggy beatnik character) Freddie Prinze Jr. (the vain spoiled Fred) Sarah Michelle Gellar (cast as the beautiful Daphne) and Linda Cardellini (the brainy Velma) did the best they could with their parts. The plot? That has the mystery-solving team of Shaggy Fred Daphne Velma and their large talking animated dog Scooby-Doo flying to Spooky Island where a mysterious man named Emile Mondavarious (Rowan Atkinson) runs an amusement park for college-age students on spring break. Lately the students have been undergoing odd transformations at Spooky Island arriving as typical thrill-seekers but leaving as stiff brain-locked automatons. Whos sabotaging the theme park? Thats the question for the private investigating quintet. The premise behind ""Scooby-Doo"" lets an animated dog and his best friends roam around a tropical hideaway enter strange buildings and -- if they can avoid getting hurt -- unveil the secret behind all the monstrous mayhem. For families with children ""Scooby-Doo"" might be a fine way to while away some time. For adults still hooked on the ""Scooby-Doo"" series (I hope thats not a sizable group) this film will also be fun. Others contemplating ""Scooby- Doo"" will have to ask themselves this Do you really want to spend money watching what is essentially marginality or would those dollars be better used to see a better film or even buy a good book? Advisory This film contains some violence. -- Jonathan Curiel LATE MARRIAGE Drama. Directed and written by Dover Kosashvili. (Not rated. 100 minutes. In Georgian and Hebrew with English subtitles. At the UA Galaxy Rafael Film Center in San Rafael and Towne 3 in San Jose.) Dont expect another ""Monsoon Wedding"" from this tough-minded film about arranged marriages between Soviet Georgian immigrants in Israel. Writer- director Dover Kosashvili is a shrewd observer of cultural collision and his film -- a stunning directing debut -- is anything but sentimental about old- country customs. Zaza played by the charismatic sleepy-eyed Lio Ashkenazi is a 31-year- old graduate student in philosophy who keeps dodging his parents matchmaking efforts. By his estimation theyve made 100 attempts to find him a wife ""The ones I liked didnt like me"" he shrugs. Zaza isnt gay; hes not even overly picky. The real source of resistance is his secret relationship with Judith (Ronit Elkabetz) a beautiful Moroccan divorcee with a 6-year-old daughter. When Zazas family discovers the romance they converge on Judiths apartment humiliate her and threaten her life in front of her daughter. The brutal frankness of that scene is matched by a long earlier episode when Zaza and Judith have sex. The actors are naked and nothing is held back but Kosashvili doesnt sweeten the moment with dramatic lighting or cunning camera moves. It feels real unvarnished but is no less sexy for those qualities. Kosashvili focuses on character dynamics lets scenes run on for a long time and rarely moves the camera. ""Late Marriage"" at first feels flat and enervated; after a while the pacing lack of artifice and compelling story create a kind of hypnotizing pull. Ashkenazi and Elkabetz are sensational in the lead roles struggling to protect their love against the combined force of Zazas family. Zazas mother cold and invincible is played by Lili Kosashvili the directors mother. Advisory This film contains nudity sexual situations and rough language. -- Edward Guthmann THE SLEEPY TIME GAL Drama. Starring Jacqueline Bisset Martha Plimpton and Nick Stahl. Directed by Christopher Munch. (Not rated. 94 minutes. At the Roxie Cinema.) ""The Sleepy Time Gal"" is a smooth elegiac mood piece about a free-spirited woman who is hit with a terminal illness while in her prime. As part of her coming to terms with her stormy life she searches for the daughter whom she gave up for adoption years before -- even as her biological daughter embarks on a search for her. Directed by Christopher Munch the film is semiautobiographical based on the story of the directors mother. Its at times moving and at other times slow but what makes the film compelling is the mood it instills in the audience a mood very much like the melancholy and disorienting cloud that comes over us when a loved one is seriously ill. Jacqueline Bisset plays the mother Frances a woman with a colorful past as a jazz disc jockey in her youth and as a social activist freelance writer and history buff in her later years. Along the way there were the men who fell in love with her had their heads handed to them and spent the rest of their lives growing old and daydreaming. Bisset of course makes it easy to believe in Frances allure but she also brings a quality of wisdom and sadness an unsentimental acceptance of the fact that a single life even one lived to the fullest just isnt enough. The camera is right on Bisset for much of the movie much of it filmed in close-up revealing a performance of truth and depth. For Martha Plimpton as the daughter -- a corporate lawyer suddenly seized by a need to know her birth parents -- the movie provides a chance to break out of the satiric comic roles for which she has been noted and to dive into something emotional. She succeeds. ""The Sleepy Time Gal"" is sneaky in the best way. Its rhythms and currents sink into a viewers consciousness and linger in the mind. Advisory This film contains mildly strong language. -- Mick LaSalle THE BELIEVER Drama. Starring Ryan Gosling. Directed and written by Henry Bean. (R. 100 minutes. At the Lumiere.) When ""The Believer"" couldnt find a distributor after winning the 2001 Sundance Grand Jury Prize cries of cowardice emerged. Studios were simply too afraid of the film about a young Jewish man turned neo-Nazi the argument went. Blessed with a searing lead performance by Ryan Gosling (""Murder by Numbers"") the movie is powerful and provocative. Its also built on a faulty premise one it follows into melodrama and silliness. Maybe those aspects put studios e off -- that is until Showtime aired the movie and a small distributor agreed to release it. Writer and director Henry Beans concept -- that a brilliant yeshiva student is so tortured by religious questions that he turns on his own people - - is initially intriguing if counterintuitive. Watching Goslings conflicted rage-filled face as he terrorizes a helpless Jewish kid you almost buy it. Almost. Bean never establishes what made such a bright kid into a monster. Having to associate with thickheaded racist cronies would drive a smart guy up the wall. But the character is supposed to be rejecting an oppressive God and what he sees as Jews inaction in the face of brutality. Wouldnt he turn his rage toward God or toward the Jews oppressors then? The movies shift into an implausible thriller magnifies its lack of character development. But Gosling gives an impassioned performance throughout. The skinny former Mousketeer carries himself with such self-assured menace that he becomes imposing. You believe it when his character beats the stuffing out of a muscle-bound rival skinhead. The most maddening aspect of the film is how a single scene can be dumb and profound at the same time. When the racist skinheads are sent to ""sensitivity training"" at a Holocaust survivors group the setup strains credibility but then delivers the pictures most emotionally satisfying moment. After Goslings arrogant know-it-all condemns a man for failing to pummel the Nazis who killed his son a woman responds ""Here in this rich safe stupid country its easy to imagine ones self a hero."" Exactly just as its easy to make a controversial movie without saying enough. Advisory This film contains violence sexual scenes rampant ethnic and religious slurs. -- Carla Meyer LES DESTINEES Drama. Starring Emmanuelle Beart Charles Berling and Isabelle Huppert. Directed by Oliver Assayas. (Not rated. 180 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Whenever I reflect ruefully on how quickly time passes Im reassured by movies like ""Les Destinees"" which can take three hours and stretch them into something that feels like 10 days in a sweatbox. The movie suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story thats shapeless and uninflected. An adaptation of a French novel ""Les Destinees Sentimentale"" it spans the first 30 years of the 20th century as it follows Jean a spiritually restless fellow who gets dragged into the family porcelain business. Jean whos played by Charles Berling starts off passive and gloomy and he ends up that way. Three hours of this guy. Jeans story is hardly interesting or emblematic enough to be worthy of a feature-length movie much less the epic treatment. Fortunately his women have more life to them. Isabelle Huppert is Jeans estranged first wife a woman of remote demeanor and suppressed rage. And Emmanuelle Beart is wife No. 2 with whom Jean makes an idyllic life in Switzerland only to risk blowing it with his indifference. Huppert and Beart are two of the best actresses in Europe but they cant save this movie. Pockets of life are rare but worth savoring. Director Olivier Assayas may have trouble shaping scenes but he does take us through the porcelain-making process showing us the workings of a turn-of-the-century factory from the pottery making to the hand-painting to the glazing. Best of all is the ballroom scene which comes early. In every other ballroom scene in movies the sound is amplified glorious and overpowering. Here the music is quiet enough that we can hear the rustle of clothing and the feet on the ballroom floor. The scene is not nearly as romantic as what weve come to expect but its more human. Still if given a choice of whether to sit through ""Les Destinees"" take the sweatbox. Advisory This film contains sexual situations. -- Mck LaSalle Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 4 Dear Abby I dont want anyone to know that Ive retired 5 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 6 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F. 7 33 signs youre living in the San Francisco bubble 8 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 9 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 10 San Francisco ranks surprisingly low on the list of 20 Most...

C- Scooby-Doo Genre Comedy; Starring Linda Cardellini Sarah Michelle Gellar Matthew Lillard Freddie Prinze Jr. Rowan Atkinson Isla Fisher Mark McGrath; Director Raja Gosnell; Author James Gunn; Release Date Wide 06/14/2002; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted August 7 2012 -- 1200 AM EDT Ruh-roh Romethings really wrong with this ricture The live-action adventure Scooby-Doo is founded on a love-it-or-hate-it (and you know who you are) pop cultural phenomenon the long-running Hanna-Barbera cartoon in which four high-decibel young people and a talking high-maintenance dog solve mysteries and eat snacks. No surprises there. But garbled in the translation is a sense of whether this manic production is meant for pre-ironic kids or an older more sophisticated audience The antics involving ghosts chases and burping that divert the small fry dont mix with the jokey tribute-band dialogue spouting from the Mystery Inc. gang. (Celebrity Scooby-philes include Sarah Michelle Gellar Freddie Prinze Jr. and Matthew Lillard in full doofus mode as Shaggy.)
