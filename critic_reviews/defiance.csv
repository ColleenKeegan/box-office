This time its the Bielski brothers leaders of a group of Belorussian Jews who hid in the woods during the Nazi occupation.Clearly relishing the opportunity to do more than smirk and shoot people Daniel Craig frowns and shoots people as  older brother Tuvia who attempts to hold the  community together while sibling Zus (Liev Schreiber) heads off to join the partisans. Its an extraordinary tale fully deserving of the hefty Hollywood treatment. The Bielskis sheltered anyone and everyone even going so far as to liberate a nearby ghetto.Which only makes Zwicks  predictable treatment of the material more frustrating. His films have always been trad Hollywood with more old-school style than actual substance. Defiance doesnt even have style hemmed in by its forest setting and photographed with an unremittingly bland colour palette. The action sequences are perfunctory and confusing full of smoke and fury acting to force the story forward rather than set the pulse racing. The film ties itself in knots trying to be both  historical account and ripping adventure - Schindlers List by way of The Dirty Dozen. In the end neither aspect satisfies resulting in a drab if  diverting Sunday afternoon spectacle.

Edward Zwick is the director and he made the decision to sacrifice realism for action and character development. I am sure that this has made it more interesting and exciting to watch for it is both of these things but it is a Hollywood version of a true story.Defiance is an apt title given that the movie depicts a large group of Jewish refugees surviving harsh winters in the forests of Belorussia despite the attempts of the Nazis to annihilate them. Daniel Craig Liev Schreiber and Jamie Bell are all excellent as the brothers who led the group and the story told is both gripping and inspiring.  It was nominated for an Academy Award for the best Original Score. The script is rough and the point of view fixed this makes some of the characters seem a little two dimensional. However in terms of action and tension the film works well and it held my interest right to the closing credits.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreOct 13 2013Allan GranovskyFeaturedThank god for this movie.The truth about Germans and their crimes and the people or things that sided with them.The more this is shown that jewish people killed those animals when they found the guns.

A superb (and true) story with two great lead actors and some great actions scenes. Shame the film failed to live up to its potential. With a confusing and obtuse plot and strangely awful diaglogue Defiance fails where other Holocaust-movies succeeded. Had the reveal of the mass-graves been better placed or the character been given a clearer background then maybe this film would have been a ground-breaker. But for a real top film stick to Schindlers List or even the episode of Band of Brothers in which the Holocaust is covered.

It is an historical film telling the true life story of how the Bielski brothers (played by Craig Bell and Schreiber) saved hundreds of lives of Jews from the Nazis. It is 2 and 1/4 hours but you do not notice the length at all as it is so compelling. It is very moving in parts and I think that it is an important historical piece of history that we should remember so as to avoid such discrimination in the future. It is credit to Craig that he took on the role of Tuvia.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor January 17 2009 Save for later Saved Survival and revenge Daniel Craig sheds his 007 persona for a better suited heroic fight this time against the Nazis. Newscom          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Despite the glut of Holocaust movies this season including ""Valkyrie"" ""The Reader"" and ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" no one can accuse them of being thematically alike. Now comes ""Defiance"" a never-before-filmed story of Jewish survival directed by Edward Zwick in big bold frankly old-fashioned Hollywood high style.Based on a 1993 book by historian Nechama Tec it focuses on three brothers the Bielskis - Tuvia (Daniel Craig) a thief and smuggler who has been in hiding since 1941 when the Nazis wiped out the community where his family farmed; Zus (Liev Schreiber) a troublemaker even more violence prone than Tuvia; and Asael (Jamie Bell) who compared with his siblings is like a babe-in-the-Belarus woods.Those woods are both the battlefront and the haven for what gradually under Tuvias command becomes a self-sustaining ragtag detachment of Jewish civilians whom he must eventually lead to safety. The intellectuals in this community are looked down upon by the Bielskis because they lack survivalist skills - its a neat reversal of the usual emphasis in Jewish-themed dramas on the primacy of the scholar. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Eventually after a violent fight between Tuvia and Zus that like much in ""Defiance"" is almost biblical in its implications Zus breaks away from the encampment and sides with Soviet partisans aligned with the Red Army. Ultimately 50 Jews died 1200 were saved - by other Jews. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Defiance Its a heroic story and Zwick frames it rather too strenuously as an antidote to the generic Holocaust stories of Jewish passivity and martyrdom. And yet as a piece of historical redress a great service has been done in bringing this narrative to the screen. (Zwick who previously directed such square-jawed socially-conscious entertainments as ""The Last Samurai"" and ""Blood Diamond"" collaborated with Clayton Frohman on the screenplay.) It satisfies an undeniable need to see Jewish fighters during the Holocaust not only resist as in dramatizations of the Warsaw ghetto uprising but prevail. When Tuvia early on kills the local police chief who murdered his father his revenge is so visceral that even when he later renounces it and states that ""our revenge is to live"" you cant shake off the blood lust thickening the damp chill air.Herein lies the difficulty with ""Defiance"" which is brought home in a later sequence when Jews set upon a Nazi and pummel him to death. The scene is shocking but lacks the layers of valor and revulsion that would have made it a far more ambiguously horrifying event. Whatever Zwick intends in his more high-minded moments ""Defiance"" is forthrightly a rallying cry for Jewish retribution. The message is To survive one must kill.A more complexly thoughtful film might have followed this logic into byways far darker than Zwick explores. (For all its faults ""Munich"" did just that though it overcorrected.) Whenever ""Defiance"" threatens to become not only dramatically but philosophically disturbing it pulls back into the safety zone of conventional heroics - albeit enacted by unconventional almost feral heroes. Too much is spelled out for us too many speeches have a stentorian heft. Do we really need to hear Tuvia announce Moses-like that his communal goal is to ""live free like human beings for as long as we can""?Although the decision to have the actors speak in Slavic accents is regrettable both Craig and Schreiber triumph over them. Craig has been criticized for being miscast but I no more felt that way about him here than I did in ""Munich"" where he played a Mossad assassin. His opaqueness actually works better for him here than it did as 007 in ""Quantum of Solace"" where he seemed lobotomized. Hes a powerful presence both in repose and in action. Schreiber incarnates the physicality of his character to such a degree that when that fraternal fight erupts I feared not for Tuvia but for Craig.To call a movie these days old-fashioned is not such a bad thing - not when you see what most newfangled movies are like. Zwicks best movie ""Glory"" about the first unit of black Civil War soldiers was a solid example of how history and Hollywood could successfully coalesce. ""Defiance"" strains to be a better a more ""important"" movie than it actually is but in this era of ""dark"" superheroes here are a pair of ordinary mortals who could give Iron Man a run for his money.

"Defiance Remarkable yet restrained | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsDefiance Remarkable yet restrainedThe burden of expectations weighs heavily upon Defiance  a remarkable story of Jewish resistance fighters during World War II.Daniel Craig stars as Tuvia Bielski in the heroic tale of Jewish resistance fighters Defiance.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Jan. 16 2009 Defiance (out of 4)Starring Daniel Craig Liev Schreiber Jamie Bell and Alexa Davalos. Directed by Edward Zwick. 137 minutes. At major theatres. 14A The burden of expectations weighs heavily upon Defiance a remarkable story of Jewish resistance fighters during World War II. Few people know the facts about three Belarusian brothers - Tuvia (Daniel Craig) Zus (Liev Schreiber) and Asael (Jamie Bell) Bielski - who led a forest rebellion against the Nazi Holocaust saving 1200 lives. Their heroism remained unsung until a 1993 book by historian Nechama Tec the basis of this movie by Edward Zwick (Glory) shone the spotlight upon them.The story is so inherently dramatic its a natural for screen adaptation. Its also that rare Holocaust picture where Jews are not depicted as meek victims.All the more reason to feel slightly disappointed by Zwicks restraint and also that of his co-writer Clayton Frohman. Its understandable and laudable that they desire not to sensationalize the Bielskis and theyve made a worthy film. But their understated approach makes the struggle seem less urgent than it must surely have been.The movie is being marketed under somewhat false pretenses. Posters show a stoic and solitary Daniel Craig cradling a shotgun as he scans for trouble. Fans of Craigs James Bond could be forgiven for thinking this is a similar movie.This is really an ensemble picture with convincing performances by leads Craig Schreiber and Bell. They are backed by strong supporting players chiefly Alexa Davalos as Craigs love interest.Craig does see some action as eldest brother Tuvia the de facto leader of the forest rebels. But unlike his avenging angel in Munich hes more Gandhi than Genghis counselling his younger brothers Zus and Asael to eschew vengeance and kill only when necessary. The Nazis are busily stacking bodies - including those of the Bielskis parents - but ""we must not become like them"" Tuvia says.He is also the one who opts to take in as many fugitive Jews as possible as they forge a survival camp deep within the massive Belarusian forests. Zus sees this as cowardly and foolish ""You dont have the stomach to do what must be done"" he scoffs. He wants to kills as many Germans as possible.Young Asael meanwhile isnt quite sure who he sides with but hes determined to assist in any way he can.Its hard not to sympathize with Zuss view. If ever there were a case for righteous vengeance this would be it and the audience wants to cheer the good guys and boo the villains. Defiance has the potential to be as big a World War II movie as The Great Escape or Stalag 17 but Zwick has neither the desire nor the instincts to make a conventional action movie.There are flashes of this in the occasional confrontations with Nazi soldiers and in scenes where Zus enlists with soldiers of the Russian Army who share a common foe and no fear of blood. The more physically imposing Schreiber is first amongst equals in the male leads making the strongest impact.But Zwick is more interested in chronicling the day-to-day struggles of the Bielski partisans and there is some value in this. The role of women in the forest camp is given far more prominence and significance than in most such pictures.And you have to credit the inspired insanity of casting two Britons (Craig Bell) and an American (Schreiber) as the Bielskis. All three actors manage reasonable Belarusian accents much more convincingly than the Brits and Americans German accents in Valkyrie.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Starring Daniel Craig Liev Schreiber and Jamie Bell. Directed by Edward Zwick. (R. 137 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) The lesson of ""Defiance"" is an awkward one Not every true Holocaust story deserves a Hollywood feature. It doesnt mean a story isnt important. But a feature film has certain requirements for drama and story and reality doesnt always conform. The true story of the Bielski brothers who headed a woodland community of Polish Jewish refugees in Belarus during World War II has enough in it for a great magazine article or a documentary on the History Channel but as a drama - an epic drama no less clocking in at 137 minutes - its fascination is diffused and the movie becomes something of a long slog. Still there is some built-in interest to the story and the lead actors - Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber - are charismatic and committed. Director Edward Zwick who co-authored the screenplay finds little details of human behavior and of the culture that developed in the woods to reward audience attention Men and women pair off into ""forest marriages."" The community creates its own school. There is a constant need to find food to get medicine to stay warm - and ongoing tension over whether to launch guerrilla attacks on the Germans or stay out of their way. All the same after the first hour these way-of-life details feel like minor compensations for a film thats as stuck in the woods as its characters. The movie tries to generate drama by emphasizing the conflict between the two older brothers. Tuvia Bielski (Craig) is a caring sensitive fellow who feels a strong sense of responsibility to the people in his care. Zus Bielski (Schreiber) is impatient in the role of community savior and has resentments against the ""pretentious Jews"" under their protection - that is the educated members who once looked down on him. Zus just wants to fight. Yet whatever the conflict between the brothers real or dramatized their struggle is not with each other and the audience knows it. Thus their clash simply cannot become a source of intense dramatic interest. The Bielskis fight is with the Germans and yet aside from a few skirmishes the Jewish refugees steer clear of the German army. This is true to history and its certainly understandable but it limits the movies opportunities for drama. The moral lines in ""Defiance"" are as nebulous as in real life. ""Schindlers List"" had Ralph Fiennes as the commandant who embodied everything monstrous and decadent in the Nazi regime. ""Defiance"" has corrupt townspeople thuggish Jews and anti-Semitic Soviet officers. There are few real heroes and the true villains remain offscreen. Its a testament to the films historical integrity that events werent distorted to turn ""Defiance"" into an action film. Still its difficult perhaps impossible to make a gripping 137-minute epic about people standing around under the trees. The Bielski story may be significant but its not dramatic. All the same its nice to see Craig in a sensitive role. Schreiber is as always capable and Jamie Bell as the youngest Bielski brother comes into his own over the course of the film. To Zwicks credit ""Defiance"" improves in its last 20 to 30 minutes. Yet realizing that also leads one to wonder if perhaps there might have been a perfectly entertaining 95-minute film here screaming to get out. If so we must wonder why Zwick didnt let it out. One final point Perhaps one reason ""Defiance"" lacks drama is that the Holocaust film has practically become a Hollywood subgenre and one convention of the genre is to try to end on an upbeat note. It doesnt take more than 10 seconds of active thought to realize how ridiculous that is considering that were talking about one of the most tragic and ghastly events in human history. Interestingly seven years ago the Italians made a brilliant film called ""Perlasca"" with Luca Zingaretti as a businessman who risked his life to save thousands of Jews from the Nazis. The man ended up only saving about a hundred or so people (the rest died) making the film too much of a downer for American audiences. But maybe Holocaust films should be depressing. -- Advisory This film contains violence strong language and sexual situations.

Defiance (R)  | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Defiance (R)  A riveting portrayal of true heroes of WWII. A scene from Defiance. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald The amazing real story behind Defiance is another example of truths being stranger and often more intriguing than fiction. Based on a nonfiction book by Holocaust survivor Nechama Tec the film tells the story of the Bielskis three Jewish brothers who escaped the Nazis during World War II by hiding in the forest. Led by the oldest Tuvia the Bielskis created a refuge in that freezing inhospitable place for other Jews fleeing certain death. Their group which eventually numbered 1200 included large numbers of women the elderly even infants. With a background this riveting Defiance should pack a bigger emotional punch than it does. Directed by Edward Zwick (Blood Diamond The Last Samurai) the film isnt much of a character study; too many of its secondary characters are stereotypes and it never fully engages our emotions the way Schindlers List or The Pianist did. But as a thinking persons action movie Defiance accomplishes plenty; its smart and well-acted suspenseful and entertaining. Starting in 1941 with the slaughter or detaining of most of the Jews in a Belarus village the film traces the moral paths of Tuvia (Daniel Craig) and Zus (Liev Schreiber) and their younger brother Asael (Jamie Bell) as they flee into the woods that have always been a sanctuary from the law. Hot-headed Zus understandably lusts for vengeance and at first Tuvia acquiesces; the film hints that the brothers possible smugglers have had plenty of run-ins with authority. One scene in which Tuvia confronts the man responsible for his parents deaths is among the most harrowing in the film. But Tuvia a man of action thrust suddenly into a position in which he must become contemplative or perish realizes that revenge is not the only mission. The lost and damaged souls wandering through the forest are the Bielskis responsibility. The brothers are the only ones with any experience at evading authority and without them the others wont survive. As the group grows larger and food becomes scarce conflicts erupt and brotherly bonds are tested when Zus itching for engagement joins up with a band of Russian partisans. Craig and Schreiber infuse the fraying relationship between Tuvia and Zus -- men of few words who feel more than they admit -- with understated affection and later smoldering resentment. Moments of pure Hollywood crop up from time to time -- such as the final confrontation -- and Defiance feels a bit flabby in its middle section. But Zwick stages many powerful scenes and he uses his winter backdrop to mesmerizing effect moving effortlessly to chronicle joy (the community celebrates a wedding and snow falls softly and benignly) and danger (a tense standoff over dwindling supplies). Defiance may lack the sort of emotional punch that sticks but its story of courage and responsibility is undeniably compelling.

Rare is a movie like The Counterfeiters in which pragmatic Jewish characters ply their wits to survive. Rarer still is the portrait of the Jew as fighter and hero a brawny architect of his own fate. We can find him in accounts of the Warsaw Ghetto (TVs Uprising). In Defiance we meet a whole forest full of them -- led by a pair of muscular siblings brought to life with growling intensity by the edgy Liev Schreiber and the righteous Daniel Craig. Think of the latter as James Bond if you must but a more relevant piece of work is his 2005 performance as a fulminating Israeli Mossad agent in Steven Spielbergs Munich. He bears a grudge the way he carries a gun with two bare hands and a crease between his eyes. The story of the Bielski brothers who formed a secret partisan encampment that resisted the Nazis and sheltered more than a thousand Jews was ripe for the picking. Its astonishing to realize their saga hasnt made it to the big screen before this because it seems to have it all wooded hideouts vengeful bloodlust feuding brothers and extreme human endurance. Just for good measure the plot also throws in a few moments of stolen tenderness (sex) and ferocious combat condensing and fictionalizing history all the while. But heroism at least at the movies must follow its appointed path. In 1941 oldest brother Tuvia (Craig) middle brother Zus (Schreiber) and younger brother Asael (Jamie Bell) escape from Nazi-occupied Poland into the Belarussian woods during a German campaign to deport and liquidate Jews. Their parents were killed by a local cop conspiring with the SS and their first order of business is survival. Their second is revenge. Far down the list of priorities is rescuing and feeding other Jews but they have a way of showing up hungry The liveliest is a nerdy commie intellectual played by a game Mark Feurstein. Zus the hardened realist wants to shrug them off and join up with a Russian contingent fighting the Germans. Tuvia becomes the conscience-stricken leader of the group -- setting up camp organizing supply raids and establishing a one-man rule of law that forms the basis of a makeshift village. Director Edward Zwick back on the battlefield with glory and sacrifice abandons the heat-struck vistas of 2006s Blood Diamond for a cooler loamier corner of the world. The sights and sounds of covert forest living give Defiance a familiar Robin Hood aesthetic. Snow crunches twigs snap. Sunlight stabs the canopy of trees. It is all in all a film as square-shouldered as its leads -- tough-minded forcibly acted and conventionally spun by Zwick and co-writer Clayton Frohman who adapted Nechama Tecs Defiance The Bielski Partisans. Aside from fudging the Bielskis birth order (Asael was older than Zus) and simplifying the meaty ethnic soup in that part of the world (the Poles arent happy) their quirkiest move was the decision to mash up English dialogue with subtitled vernacular. One second everyones expectorating their lines in knockoff Eastern-European accents; in the next by golly theyre speaking Russian. Its less distracting than it sounds. And it hardly matters which language were hearing most of the time because the chest-thumping message gets across with a minimum of verbiage. Men must be free; Jews must survive. And Tuvia fully transformed into a Zwick-certified Hollywood hero must ride a fine white horse through the forest. That is until he kills it to feed his people.

Comments click to enlarge Defiance Rated R  2008 Edward Zwick (Blood Diamond) adapts Nechama Tecs nonfiction book about the Bielski brothers Polish Jews who outfoxed the Nazis and saved 1200 lives by building a partisan community in the woods of Belarus. As the eldest brother a smuggler turned resistance leader Daniel Craig gives a strong performance but gets upstaged by Liev Schreiber as his hotheaded sibling who avenges the murders of their family by joining the Red Army. Zwick intent on correcting the perception of Jews as passive victims lets the action set pieces overwhelm the more intimate scenes several of which are already diminished by stilted dialogue. Some of the quieter moments are better like those with Jamie Bell as a younger brother whose marriage sparks a light in the forest and points to a future beyond.

"Defiance stars Daniel Craig Liev Schreiber Jamie Bell - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Defiance stars Daniel Craig Liev Schreiber Jamie Bell Michael PhillipsTribune critic No historically grounded film is obliged to stick to the facts and having made ""Glory"" ""The Last Samurai"" and ""Blood Diamond"" in order of decreasing effectiveness director Edward Zwick knows firsthand the difficulty of forging potentially uncommercial subject matter into satisfying popular entertainment.Yet some stories resist Hollywood manhandling more than others. Zwicks latest "" Defiance"" holds you and its story is remarkable. The telling of that story however feels honest one minute and false the next and the films determination to mythologize the heroism of the real-life characters comes across as unseemly. In 1941 in the area known then as Belorussia (now Belarus) a farmers son with a checkered past named Tuvia Bielski led the rescue of more than 1000 fellow Jews by establishing what became known as ""Jerusalem in the woods""--a settlement deep in the Naliboki Forest. ""We know these woods"" says Tuvias brother Asael played by Jamie Bell. ""Theyll never find us here."" Daniel Craig portrays Tuvia the charismatic circumspect leader of this collective. Liev Schreiber perpetually gunning down Nazis is the hotheaded brother of action Zus. Alongside Bells Asael there is a fourth brother Aron played by young George MacKay and first seen hiding in a farmhouse cellar having survived a massacre. Later many Jews who have the chance to join the Bielskis in the forest choose not to. Says Schreibers exasperated Zus simplifying in the extreme ""Fight or wait to be killed."" The script boils everything down to simple reductive maxims. The characters sound less like real people in a grimly dramatic circumstance than supporting turns in an old-fashioned play. ""If my friends at the New Socialist Club could see me now"" says the self-professed intellectual played by Mark Feuerstein assisting with the construction of a shelter. Lines such as this akin to Zwicks habit of grouping his extras just so (like extras) keep ""Defiance"" firmly in movieland as opposed to life.Zwicks technique has its strengths. Hes a front-and-center story man though in both ""Blood Diamond"" and ""Defiance"" the strain of addressing deadly serious matters while setting up the next violent set piece becomes troubling. Here he cross-cuts ""Godfather""-style between the wedding celebration of brother Asael and his bride and Zus dazzling commando attack on the latest group of Nazi soldiers. Its a misplaced attempt at virtuosity; because were witnessing wholly justified slaughter juxtaposed against loving ritual the dramatic impact is muffled. The script hokes up the tensions between the brothers played by Craig and Schreiber and while theyre both fascinating simmering-kettle performers they consistently outshine their material. Much of the film cannot help but get you in the gut. Its an action-packed melodrama at heart. And thats why ""Defiance"" is a limited achievement The film shouldve aimed higher given all that these people endured to have their story told.mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating R (for violence and language).Running time 217.Opening Jan. 16.Starring Daniel Craig (Tuvia Bielski); Liev Schreiber (Zus Bielski); Jamie Bell (Asael Bielski); Alexa Davalos (Lilka); Allan Corduner (Shimon); Mark Feuerstein (Isaac).Directed by Edward Zwick; written by Clayton Frohman and Zwick based on the book by Nechama Tec; photographed by Eduardo Serra; edited by Steven Rosenblum; music by James Newton Howard; production designed by Dan Weil; produced by Zwick and Pieter Jan Brugge.

Im sick of those guys."" Maybe it helps if you havent seen ""Valkyrie"" ""The Reader"" ""The Boy in Striped Pajamas"" or any other recent World War II drama for that matter. But the resistance drama ""Defiance"" just doesnt seem to have anything to add to the swastika overload currently clogging the nations theaters. We are about to cross the threshold from ""Never again"" to ""Enough already."" In ""Defiance"" Daniel Craig plays Tuvia Bielski a real but little-known freedom fighter. Tuvia and brothers Zus (Liev Schreiber) and Asael (Jamie Bell) were gunslinging Jewish smugglers before the war. In 1941 with Polish police slaughtering Jews (including their parents) the Bielskis turned their sights on the collaborators and then the Nazis. Between guerrilla raids they holed up in the Belarussian woods establishing a makeshift camp that was soon inundated with Jewish refugees from neighboring towns. The outlaw brothers found themselves in the unlikely position of community leaders protecting urban sophisticates who had looked down on them in times of peace. Its a great premise all the better for being true. Amazingly this remarkable chapter of World War II history hasnt been dramatized before. But in the heavy hands of director Edward Zwick the story is hokey bloated and dull. Zwick has loused up action-packed historical dramas before. In fact hes made a career of it -- ""The Last Samurai"" and ""Blood Diamond"" most recently. Hes fatally fixated on Teaching Us Important Lessons turning adventure films into homework. Suffering sacrifice soulful faces -- weve seen it all 47 times before. Zwick does the thick-witted screenplay no favors cutting to a close-up at each and every emotional peak. Not trusting viewers to grasp the horror of war on our own he pushes tear-stained faces at us just in case. The film a glacially paced 135 minutes leads us through a year at the camp as malnutrition threatens romances emerge and divisions endanger the groups solidarity. When the brutal winter and the advancing Germans approach the idealist and the man of action must join forces to save the refugees. Bet you didnt see that coming. Feed Loader Star Tribune Defiance Lets give it this The major parts are well portrayed in spite of almost unplayable dialogue. Craig playing the idealistic eldest Bielski declares ""Our revenge is to live"" and works to keep his ragtag forest community safely hidden. Tuvia is called on to suffer deprivation stoically brood and toss off idealistic sound bites that would have gotten him pelted with stones in real life. ""We may be hunted like animals but we will not become animals"" you say? Take that you pompous blowhard. But somehow Craig retains his dignity. Schreibers fierce Zus is a more engaging part. He wants kill-em-all vengeance not mere survival. He rebels joining the Red Army to battle the German invaders. The Soviets have their own brand of anti-Semitism but at least he gets to shoot Nazis. Beyond the physicality of the role we never gain much insight into this roughneck. Zus and Tuvia are temperamental opposites and they come to blows more than once but we are left to guess why the animosity runs so deep between them. The film draws parallels between Tuvia Bielskis heroism and the story of Moses leading the Israelites to freedom. But it will be the audience thats eyeing the exit signs and planning their own exodus.

In this moss-carpeted wonderland of whispering pines (shot with emerald clarity by cinematographer Eduardo Serra) members of the Jewish Resistance build a forest sanctuary to defend themselves from slaughter by Nazis and their Fascist collaborators. The architects of this thatched-roof compound are the battling Bielski brothers Tuvia (Daniel Craig) and Zus (Liev Schreiber). Tuvia is an ever-patient peacemaker; Zus a headstrong warrior. The Bielski siblings personify the debate about nonviolence and violence that has raged at least since biblical times. Astride a white stallion that might as well be Pegasus Tuvia represents the we-shall-turn-our-swords-into-ploughshares cause. Training his rifle on collaborators responsible for the death of his parents Zus is more the eye-for-an-eye type of guy. It is less Tuvias and Zus moral stances and more Craigs and Schreibers magnetism that makes Defiance a rousing ride. Disdaining violence except in self-defense Tuvia presides over the encampment where as many as 1200 Jews thrived and survived. While Tuvia coolly channels all energy into survival Zus blood boils with revenge. Frustrated under his brothers regime Zus leaves the forest to join the Red Army and kill Nazis. As directed by Ed Zwick (Glory Blood Diamond) Defiance is a wobbly stool a seat propped up by the uneven legs of ethics debate Holocaust movie and action thriller. Still the fascination and novelty of Nazi-killing Jews who dont perish in the death camps packs quite the wallop. Based on the nonfiction chronicle of the same title by Nechama Tec Defiance corrects the received picture of European Jews cowering under the boot heel of Hitlerism. Here Jews are not victims of genocide but victors in the organized resistance against it. Screenwriter Clayton Frohman distills this reversal into the memorable bit of byplay between a Soviet officer encountering the armed Bielski brothers ""Jews dont fight"" proclaims the dismissive Soviet; ""These Jews do"" respond the Bielskis in a rallying cry that could be out of Friendly Persuasion to name one of those movies where a pacifist Quaker takes up arms. The stereotype-shattering film also notes that other social reversal That it was uneducated peasants such as the Bielskis - not the men of learning - who safeguarded lives and were desired by well-born women who sought refuge from the Nazis in the forests of Belarus. Defiances few humorous passages are about the conflict between the Jews skilled with their hands like the Bielskis and those skilled with their heads like the scholars played by Allan Corduner and Mark Feuerstein. Example ""What do you do?"" asks eagle-eyed Zus of the bespectacled Isaac (Feuerstein). ""I am an . . . intellectual"" stammers Isaac. ""This is a job?"" laughs the amused Zus. That the longish (two hours-plus) film rarely flags is because of the powerful performances of Craig who resembles a craggy rock painted by a Cubist and Schreiber a killer teddy bear sculpted by Jeff Koons. They reminded me of Lenny Bruces definition of a tough guy - a man who can wear a wool suit without underwear. These guys look to be wearing wool underwear without the suit.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Its an inspiring tale obviously so much so that director Edward Zwick evidently felt the need to treat nearly every frame with Great Cinematic Importance draining it of spontaneity. If it can happen in life - birth love sickness war death - it happens here unfolding in such a pat manner that it plays at times more like a soap opera than what it really is a story that more of the world deserves to know. The Bielski brothers parents are killed by Nazis who are relying on locals for information so they can round up Jews and either exterminate them or send them off to concentration camps. Tuvia (Daniel Craig) Zus (Liev Schreiber) and Asael (Jamie Bell) escape to the forest; its hinted that Tuvia and Zus are low-grade smugglers. Their expertise at navigating the labyrinthine woods implies a good working knowledge of the place as if theyve hidden out there before. Soon theyre joined by a growing band of resistance fighters although thats not what youd call them at first. Intellectuals must learn to fire weapons and build huts. Jews arent fighters a Soviet officer scoffs. These Jews are Zus replies. Although thats true their taste for fighting differs. Zus is a hothead ready to kill and less ready to continue taking in new members of the group. After disagreements with Tuvia he joins up with the Soviet army while Tuvia stays with the ever-increasing population of the forest community as its de facto leader. Hes more thoughtful more measured though not opposed to using violence when needed whether seeking vengeance for his parents deaths or strengthening his control of the ragtag bunch hes leading. The group forges its own society its own rules. Men take ""forest wives."" Alliances and friendships form; a rabbi (Allen Corduner) and an intellectual (Mark Feuerstein) bat ideas back and forth like so many tennis balls. Tuvia becomes ill and his hold on control weakens. Zus meanwhile proves an effective fighter impressing the Soviet officers. Yet they cant overcome their prejudices at least not fully. Asael younger than Zus and Tuvia comes of age in the forest. Bell is good in the role which isnt as showy as those of Craig and Schreiber. Theyre good as well though Schreiber in particular is saddled with cliches of the fiery-warrior variety. In real life the Bielskis helped keep 1200 Jews alive. Its a feat both amazingly heroic and amazingly little-known. Zwick who co-wrote the screenplay deserves credit for getting the story out in front of more people. Unfortunately its as if he is so in awe of the subject matter that hes afraid to bring anything of himself to it ironically rendering Defiance less awe-inspiring than it should have been.

"Movie review Defiance -- 3 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Defiance -- 3 out of 5 stars A scene from Defiance Paramount Vantage A scene from Defiance A scene from Defiance (Paramount Vantage) Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Defiance is in too many ways to count a defiantly old fashioned World War II Resistance movie.See the brave partisans ambush the Germans. See them hide in the forest between attacks. See them ruthlessly execute collaborators and make noble speeches that declare ""We must not become them"" meaning the Nazis. See them drink vodka. And make more vodka from their own potatoes. See them find time for love.But the twist in this film by a director known for his taste for old-fashioned action (Edward Zwick) is that these partisans are Jews fighting extermination in the Holocaust. History has long agreed with what one Russian Army soldier says to them dismissively ""Jews dont fight."" Defiance tells the ""true"" story of the BielskiO brothers Jewish country boys who lived on the edge of the law (they did a little smuggling) in their corner of Belarus. When the SS and its local henchmen began rounding up Jews and shooting them (including most of their family) brothers Tuvia ( Daniel Craig) Zus (Liev Schreiber) AsaelO ( Jamie Bell) and Aron (George MacKay) lit out for the woods they knew well. Every massacre in every village and town near them had survivors and those huddled masses wound up in those same woods. These were often city Jews ""intellectuals"" but the tough-minded country Jew brothers felt responsible for them. Soon they had an entire community encamped with them.The film sets up a war of wills as Zus declares ""Blood for blood"" but Tuvia realizes how pointless revenge is in their current state.""We cannot afford revenge. Our revenge is to live.""Its easy to picture a screen hero from an earlier time riding a white horse (as Craig does) chewing up lines like that. This could have been a Kirk Douglas movie from the early 60s a Spartacus with submachine guns or a Cast a Giant Shadow showing us this mini-socialist state set up in the Belorussian forest a model for the kibbutzim and tough unisex army of modern Israel. Some of us loved those corny noble movies. The downtrodden include pretty women (Alexa Davalos among them) who become ""forest wives"" to men who lost their spouses in massacres. That gives the picture the gloss of ""family.""But Zwick of Glory Courage Under Fire and The Last Samurai stages a mean battle scene. Every ambush every shootout (some filmed in slow-motion) is a rousing firefight in his hands.And as corny and downright flirtatious as this ""Holocaust drama"" gets its still a vivid and heroic look at a side of that tragedy that we havent seen before. Zwick Craig and especially Schreiber have seen to it that nobody speaking of the Holocaust will ever say ""Jews dont fight"" again.

These days you would have to look far and wide to find a Holocaust movie that even tries to capture the full unimaginable horror. The subject may be survivors guilt gone mad (Adam Resurrected) a mission impossible to assassinate Hitler (Valkyrie) or a death camp guards Summer ? of 42 of sexiness and secret shame ? (The Reader) but in this season of grimly hooky Third Reich parables its hard to shake the feeling that the Holocaust has turned from the ultimate furrowed-brow movie theme into a genre with its own built-in flowers-of-evil mystique. Rarely has genocide been put to the service of so much ? unabashed...entertainment. Remember that scene in Knocked Up where Seth Rogens Ben said that he dug Munich because he finally got to see a film in which the Jews kicked ass? He would have loved Defiance even more. In this true story of a WWII siege met with courage under fire ? director Edward Zwick drops us into the Lipiczanska Forest in Belorussia ? in 1941 just after the Nazis have ? invaded. Daniel Craig with his craggy squint of pain and Liev Schreiber ? all stocky bottled rage are Tuvia and Zus Bielski who decide to save themselves with an innovative strategy They fight back. The two have never killed anyone but when Craigs Tuvia busts into the home of the officer who murdered his parents what should have been a Michael Corleone-finds-his-inner-thug moment turns into something a bit more Hollywood as he blows the guy away -- and his two sons to boot -- without a tremor of doubt or anxiety. The film has barely begun and Tuvia already looks like hes been doing this his whole life. In the woods the Bielski brothers offer protective cover to local Jews and their roving camp becomes a scruffy exodus growing in numbers each day. Tuvia leading them to the promised land of safety is meant to be Moses in a brown leather jacket -- but really hes more like Oskar Schindler and Charles Bronson in one grimly compassionate fearless Nazi-blasting package. Zwick offers excitingly staged moments but once you get past the novelty of WWII Jews acting this heroically macho Defiance bogs down in a not very well-developed script. Its a repetitive stop-and-start action film and Tuvia and Zus dont have enough layers. ? But they do kick ass charismatically. As a professor drafted into the Nazi Party (despite his liberal ideals) Viggo Mortensen in the tiny but worthy Good does what may be his most ? fascinating acting. He reveals the soul ? of an intellectual whos enlightened to ? everything but where the lust for ? absolute power leads. Good has a stagy fustiness but its worth seeing for Mortensen who makes this study of ? a ""good German"" look creepily contemporary. He shows us the horror ? of ignorance.

This time its the Bielski brothers leaders of a group of Belorussian Jews who hid in the woods during the Nazi occupation.Clearly relishing the opportunity to do more than smirk and shoot people Daniel Craig frowns and shoots people as  older brother Tuvia who attempts to hold the  community together while sibling Zus (Liev Schreiber) heads off to join the partisans. Its an extraordinary tale fully deserving of the hefty Hollywood treatment. The Bielskis sheltered anyone and everyone even going so far as to liberate a nearby ghetto.Which only makes Zwicks  predictable treatment of the material more frustrating. His films have always been trad Hollywood with more old-school style than actual substance. Defiance doesnt even have style hemmed in by its forest setting and photographed with an unremittingly bland colour palette. The action sequences are perfunctory and confusing full of smoke and fury acting to force the story forward rather than set the pulse racing. The film ties itself in knots trying to be both  historical account and ripping adventure - Schindlers List by way of The Dirty Dozen. In the end neither aspect satisfies resulting in a drab if  diverting Sunday afternoon spectacle.

Edward Zwick is the director and he made the decision to sacrifice realism for action and character development. I am sure that this has made it more interesting and exciting to watch for it is both of these things but it is a Hollywood version of a true story.Defiance is an apt title given that the movie depicts a large group of Jewish refugees surviving harsh winters in the forests of Belorussia despite the attempts of the Nazis to annihilate them. Daniel Craig Liev Schreiber and Jamie Bell are all excellent as the brothers who led the group and the story told is both gripping and inspiring.  It was nominated for an Academy Award for the best Original Score. The script is rough and the point of view fixed this makes some of the characters seem a little two dimensional. However in terms of action and tension the film works well and it held my interest right to the closing credits.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreOct 13 2013Allan GranovskyFeaturedThank god for this movie.The truth about Germans and their crimes and the people or things that sided with them.The more this is shown that jewish people killed those animals when they found the guns.

A superb (and true) story with two great lead actors and some great actions scenes. Shame the film failed to live up to its potential. With a confusing and obtuse plot and strangely awful diaglogue Defiance fails where other Holocaust-movies succeeded. Had the reveal of the mass-graves been better placed or the character been given a clearer background then maybe this film would have been a ground-breaker. But for a real top film stick to Schindlers List or even the episode of Band of Brothers in which the Holocaust is covered.

It is an historical film telling the true life story of how the Bielski brothers (played by Craig Bell and Schreiber) saved hundreds of lives of Jews from the Nazis. It is 2 and 1/4 hours but you do not notice the length at all as it is so compelling. It is very moving in parts and I think that it is an important historical piece of history that we should remember so as to avoid such discrimination in the future. It is credit to Craig that he took on the role of Tuvia.

Stuart Klawans the film critic of the Nation says so in the Jewish magazine Nextbook (but not oddly in the Nation) and Ella Taylor tentatively endorses the suggestion this week in the Village Voice. Since these are two of the movies most thoughtful commentators -- who each happen to be Jewish -- the proposal deserves consideration. Edward Zwick the TV producer (thirtysomething) and maker of Important Films (Glory Courage Under Fire Blood Diamond) writes in the New York Times that he felt a similar Holocaust-movie fatigue when offered the idea of a film on the Bielski brothers a band of real-life Jews in Belorussia during World War II. ""I groaned Not another movie about victims "" he writes. But he went ahead and made Defiance anyway. At the moment five new films that touch on the Nazis Final Solution -- Defiance The Reader Good (which prompted TIME critic Richard Schickel to call for a moratorium) The Boy in the Striped Pajamas and Adam Resurrected -- are in theaters. A sixth Valkyrie with Tom Cruise is a Holo-cousin it details a 1944 plot by German officers to kill Hitler. Taylor notes that since the early 1990s when Steven Spielberg was preparing his Oscar-winning Schindlers List there have been 170 Holocaust movies. (The Internet Movie Database lists 429 titles on the subject.) It has become not just a topic but a genre one that at its most reductive exploits the awful events of that chapter in history to badger viewers intimidate critics elicit easy tears and serve as a back-patting machine for serioso directors. The excesses of the genre have spawned derisive nicknames Holo-kitsch (Art Spiegelmans term) and Holocaust porn (which Taylor cites). Yet the enormity of the event and its dreadful intimacy -- not the long-range crime of missiles fired across borders or dropped from planes but people leading other people to gas chambers -- make it a compelling nearly irresistible movie theme. ""What a wonderful subject to explore in as many ways as possible"" indie mogul Harvey Weinstein told the New York Post. ""I hope our children get educated about the Holocaust so it will be Never again. "" Death-camp literature is such a reliable attention getter that a few writers have invented memoirs. This week Berkley Books canceled publication of Angel at the Fence when its author Herman Rosenblat acknowledged that the story of meeting his wife at Buchenwald was not true. Nonetheless a movie version of the book is going forward. Reviewing Claude Lanzmanns 9 1/2-hour documentary Shoah in TIME in 1985 I asked ""Why is this holocaust different from all other holocausts? In raw nightmare numbers the Nazi extermination of 6 million European Jews ranks below the Soviet Unions systematic starvation of the rebellious Ukraine in 1932-33 (10 million by Stalins count) and Maos catastrophic Great Leap Forward into prolonged famine in 1957-62 (at least 27 million). Uganda and Kampuchea have produced more recent evidence"" -- alas the examples of Rwanda Bosnia and Somalia could subsequently be added -- ""that Hitlers policy of mass murder as an instrument of statecraft was not unique. ""Yet the Final Solution remains the archetype of mans bestiality to man and there are compelling reasons for this to be so. The villain Hitler still seems the embodiment of melodramatic evil a spellbinder sent from hell or central casting. The perpetrators a civilized Western nation conceived the outrage of genocide and executed the plan with technological precision; if the Germans could do it anyone could. The victims the Jews eternal outsiders were traditionally treated by Christians with an uneasy mixture of envy and enmity. Here was the seed of ordinary anti-Semitism brought to rancid fruition."" Some Were Warriors Zwick was especially rankled by the legacy of Jews as victims as passive enablers of their own destruction. Thus his attraction for a film about the three elder Bielski brothers who forged a community of refugee Jews in the Belorussian woods and fought off the soldiers hunting them down. They helped other Jews escape the Warsaw ghetto. The Bielskis heroism saved about as many Jewish lives as the hero of Schindlers List did. And they were family not a wealthy Gentile whose act of paternalist benevolence can be stretched to absolve a generation of ""good Germans."" The Bielski tale showed that not all Jews were victims.

By David Denby Share Tweet Table of Contents Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber in Edward Zwicks film of a true Holocaust story. Credit Illustration by Frank Stockton In Edward Zwicks ""Defiance"" the beautiful light--a little dryer than life--has obviously been digitally altered. Yet apart from this minor shading theres not much in the film that could not have been done forty years ago. Zwicks film a true Holocaust story that most people do not know suggests some startling new ideas about resistance sex and class in the doomed provinces of Jewish Eastern Europe. But the moviemaking is resolutely old-fashioned--as square as an Arthur Miller play or an evening of Tchaikovsky. Does it matter? In this case it does not. Zwicks conservative humanist-sentimental style still has life in its aging limbs. ""Defiance"" as it turns out makes insistent emotional demands and those who respond to it at all as I did are likely to go all the way and even come out of it feeling slightly stunned. Zwick based the movie on Nechama Tecs excellent 1993 book of the same title which chronicles in great detail an anomalous corner of history. In the late autumn of 1941 in Nazi-occupied Belarus where Jews were being executed by the thousands four brothers from a large Jewish farming family named Bielski along with a few others who were determined to survive went into hiding in the forest. Gradually more ragged hungry and dazed people from the ghettos began to show up in the woods. In 1942 Tuvia Bielski the oldest brother and the leader of what became known as the Bielski Otriad (Detachment) made two extraordinary decisions. First he sensed that the best way to resist the Nazis was not to form a corps of say fifty young killers with machine guns but to take into the group every Jew who wanted to join including the malbushim the useless ones--the children the elderly the sick the unskilled the physically incompetent intellectuals--and to fight on so many fronts that survival itself became a weapon. Second he realized that the group wouldnt last unless it actively collaborated with the ragtag remnants of the overwhelmed Red Army that were forming units to harass the Germans. Some in the Bielski group joining the Soviets became partisan fighters; some repaired clothing and weapons for the soldiers; the rest miraculously improvised a civil society complete with a hospital a bathhouse and a tannery even though they were often on the move. Eventually some twelve hundred people gathered in the forest and by 1944 when the Soviets swept westward and liberated the area only fifty or so had died. It was by far the largest and most successful Jewish armed rescue of Jews during the war. At the beginning of the movie some standard blurry black-and-white documentary footage of German troops killing unarmed people glides smoothly into the staged action filmed in sharp-focus full color which is Zwicks way I think of telling us that the dramatization and the fictional invention are about to begin but that they will remain close to the facts. The movie was shot (by the cinematographer Eduardo Serra) in forests near the ones inhabited by the Bielski group and despite the digital shading I dont know when Ive seen so much raw fresh air so much rain snow and damp so tactile a rendering of trees and earth. The movie is a kind of realistic fairy tale set in a forest newly enchanted by the sanctified work of staying alive. Zwick grounds the story in the labor and in the physical discomfort and irritability of townspeople living out of their element in ratty clothes their skin withered and discolored from malnutrition. Everything is on a human scale including the partisan battles. Those in the audience who remain eager even after ""Munich"" to see Jews tear apart their enemies will not be disappointed. But the clashes with German troops though excitingly staged are presented not as an occasion for glory but as either a grim necessity of survival or an open expression of revenge. ""Defiance"" is a Hollywood product with decades of storytelling know-how behind it and Zwick and the films screenwriter Clayton Frohman have compressed and transposed events defined and sharpened tensions and in general shaped the material for emotional effectiveness and suspense. As the community grows the dramatic center of the movie shifts to a Biblical struggle between two of the Bielski brothers the touchy and aggressive Zus (Liev Schreiber) resents Tuvia (Daniel Craig) who takes control and suppresses any challenge to his authority. Zus wants to kill Germans and Tuvia milder (though hardly mild--he kills when he has to) wants to save Jews. After nearly destroying each other in a vicious fight the two split up and Zus joins the Soviets while Tuvia becomes a kind of forest-world Old Testament king. You may think Not another warring-brothers cliche but theres real emotional power in those Biblical stories and this secular version is tersely written and incisively played. Daniel Craig it turns out can embody a Moses figure without losing his sex appeal which may be the highest compliment Ive ever paid an actor. Craigs powerful compact body the flattened vertical planes of his face the baleful stare the arrogant trim to his lips--this working-class Brit is more than convincing as a Jewish partisan leader and his dry shivlike voice allows him to get away with thematic moral statements like ""We have all chosen this--to live here free like human beings for as long as we can."" The strong-looking Schreiber matches him. His Zus is surly a bit of a thug but in this context a hero and highly attractive. In fleeting moments the filmmakers develop one of Tecs most fascinating observations that in the forest the Jewish social and sexual hierarchies were turned upside down. The farmers or working-class men who could shoot gut an animal and build a shelter were sought out as protectors by the women including the educated upper-middle-class women; the formerly desirable scholars of Hegel Marx and the Talmud were not. ""Defiance"" is not without melodramatic flourishes and now and then the movie seems mightily impressed with its own nobility. Theres one rousing speech too many and I could have done with less of James Newton Howards music which pounds away at us when the action starts up and turns cloyingly plaintive at times of mourning (Joshua Bell plays a lachrymose violin theme). There are bits of overly theatrical staging as when everyone in the group talks at once and Craig silences them with a shout and they turn to him in awe. But Zwick pulls off many of the high-tension scenes deftly and easily--such as the detachments murder of Nazi collaborators or its treacherously unstable relations with the Red Army partisans who occasionally knock Jews around when they are drunk or just bored. Zwick has made an obvious swipe from ""The Godfather"" a climactic moment in which a joyful Chagallesque wedding in the forest is intercut with a bloody attack on the Germans recalls the baptism of Michael Corleones child which is intercut with the slaughter of Michaels Mob rivals. But the meaning of the juxtapositions is quite different. The first is sardonic--Corleone is a hypocrite. This one is resolutely existential if Jews want to marry and produce another generation they must learn to kill a lesson thats bound to elicit a mixed response especially now. One Jewish friend characterized the movie as ""Fiddler on the Roof"" meets ""The Dirty Dozen."" But ""Defiance"" is shrewder than that. The picture offers the most moving account weve ever had of how an ordinary rather disagreeable man challenged and then electrified by catastrophe grows into a great leader--in this case a man possessed of an uncanny sense of timing authority and force. After the war Tuvia Bielski spent a quiet decade in Israel then moved to Brooklyn where he and Zus ran taxi and trucking companies. He was largely uncelebrated in either place--perhaps because some Jews took his success in saving people as a rebuke to their own helplessness. After Tuvia died in 1987 Nechama Tec rescued him from obscurity and Edward Zwick and Daniel Craig have now sealed the case for his immortality. The award-winning French movie ""The Secret of the Grain"" is another example of big-hearted humanist filmmaking but the director Abdellatif Kechiche works not with Zwicks carefully staged groupings and closeups but with a handheld camera devouring a tumultuous overflow of life. In the port of Sete on the Mediterranean coast (near Montpellier) in a heated atmosphere of rivalry and sexual jealousy a large family of Tunisian immigrants and their French-born children gather together to eat and to quarrel. The patriarch (Habib Boufares) a laid-off dockworker desperately wants to leave something to the next generation so he opens a couscous restaurant on an old ship. Boufares a handsome square-shouldered man who is not a professional actor ducks away from the camera. As a protagonist hes a little distant but Kechiche digs a good story out of the flux and in the movies final forty minutes the suspense is terrific. Will everything be ready in time to impress the local French nabobs assembled for the opening? A feat of heroic dancing (by the beautiful Hafsia Herzi) not only saves the occasion but may permanently alter the erotic tastes of Westerners who have made a fetish of the flat lean belly.

Despite all the resources brought to bear -- strong cast ambitious scale impressive logistics dense detail fine cinematography -- the production seldom makes the leap from elaborate play-acting to authentic drama. Daniel Craig is Tuvia Bielski the oldest of three brothers who formed the Bielski partisans and the leader of the group; the other brothers Zus and Asael are played respectively by Liev Schreiber and Jamie Bell. In 1941 the Bielskis escaped from Nazi-occupied Poland took refuge in the vast forests of Belarus and while conducting guerrilla attacks on Nazi troops created a fortified village that sheltered Jewish civilians. The brothers sometimes aided by an uneasy alliance with Soviet soldiers succeeded in saving as many as 1200 men women and children by the end of World War II. Its a story that speaks to a larger truth. The Bielski partisans were only the best-known example of armed Jewish resistance to Nazi domination; some 20000 to 30000 Jews fought in partisan groups throughout Europe. Yet the director Edward Zwick who worked with Clayton Frohman on a disjointed adaptation of Nechama Tecs book translates the exploits of a diverse forest community into familiar action tropes insistent cliches (""Nothing is impossible -- what weve done is impossible"") peculiar glitches (a reference to ampicillin which didnt exist at the time a woman who says ""Look at me Ive turned into a skeleton"" when she still looks quite plump) and didactic debates between the firebrand brother Zus who only wants to kill Nazis and the humanist brother Tuvia whose first priority is saving Jewish lives. ENLARGE Daniel Craig plays a Jewish partisan in Defiance based on a real-life rescue operation in World War II. Paramount Vantage The film bears comparison to another story about saving Jewish lives -- Steven Spielbergs screen adaptation of Thomas Keneallys ""Schindlers List."" In that case the source material was not only dramatic but intricate and ironic with a flamboyant hero who unlike the admirable but one-dimensional Tuvia presented here defied most assumptions about him. ""Defiance"" also invites comparison to its own source material. The informative Web site for the film includes an archival photo among many others captioned ""four Jewish partisans in Poland."" Three of them are armed men; the fourth is a gorgeous young woman in a chic leopard-skin coat and matching hat. Who is she and what is she doing there? In fact ""Defiance"" depicts such anomalies in passing -- many Bielski refugees had only the clothes they were wearing when they escaped -- but never wavers from its straight-line narrative long enough to explore the texture and contradictions of the communitys life. The film feels historical in a Hollywood mode. Living history has been lost by the wayside. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Find related TV listings at LocateTV.

(Karen Ballard/Karen Ballard) Joe Neumaier Wednesday December 31 2008 853 AM The courage at the center of ""Defiance"" has to do not only with the truth of the movies story but also with how director Ed Zwick tells this tale of World War II heroism in as straightforward old-fashioned a way as possible.After their village parents and family farm have been destroyed by the Germans in 1942 Belarus Zus Bielski (Liev Schreiber) and his younger brother Asael (Jamie Bell) escape into the woods theyve played in since childhood. When their eldest sibling Tuvia (Daniel Craig) shows up the Bielskis make a camp and reluctantly take in fellow refugees.As more join their number the Bielskis train them to fight back against the Nazis. To maintain order they institute commune-like living; to ensure mobility they warn that no pregnancies are allowed between couples. The natural leadership of Tuvia is questioned while Asael takes a ""forest wife"" and the ""Bielski partisans"" acquire more weapons even as they scrounge for food.Craig far from James Bond but still swaggering makes a leathery craggy commander and Schreiber - wholl show his full-on action chops this summer in the Hugh Jackman ""Wolverine"" movie - is tough but sullen. Yet all this old-style moviemaking doesnt always pay off Bell becomes simply the sallow-eyed kid basically serving as the movies teary boy the representative war orphan. And the other tired and hungry seem straight out of central casting.And while ""Defiance"" generally holds up the ""underdogs save lives build a ramshackle community"" bit gets run into the ground long before the final battle. Still the facts of their fight provide resonance.Zwick (""Glory"" ""Blood Diamond"") lets more strategy and action into the movie than syrupy emotion (it doesnt seem at all crazy that the partisans could take on a tank). Plus you have to admire a film that in a season full of Nazi flicks is the only one to open with actual newsreel footage of Hitler.

Defiance (R) Paramount Vantage (137 min.). Directed by Edward Zwick. With Daniel Craig Liev Schreiber Jamie Bell. Opens Dec. 31 at theaters in New York. TWO STARS Victims dont often star in their own histories. Even when theyve survived the most horrible oppressions they dont write the first texts. Its the proud liberators who do that -- and sometimes unwittingly victimize them a second time. Because not every suffering minority was waiting passively to be saved. Often theyve been fighting for themselves all along. Like the Jews of ""Defiance."" There have been many movies about the Holocaust -- half-a-dozen it seems in just the past two months. But this film based on a true story isnt about the ghetto but the forests. About the Jews who tore off their yellow stars and picked up guns and made their own justice. Its an unusual and important story. Which makes it even sadder that its not better told. Watching the movie you realize theres a precedent here and a pretty ambitious one ""Spartacus."" Theres something of Kirk Douglas in the clenched physicality of Daniel Craig particularly as he slowly builds his little community of outcasts in the woods -- even mildly mocking the useless intellectuals who join them. The difference though is that ""Spartacus"" was written by a witty leftist Dalton Trumbo who really believed in its ideals of social revolution; it was directed by a genuine genius Stanley Kubrick who had both a soaring visual sense and just enough weary misanthropy to balance Trumbos soaring inspiration. And ""Defiance"" is co-written and directed by Edward Zwick. Zwick is a pleasant man and probably a decent one; he named his company Bedford Falls after the sweet town of ""Its a Wonderful Life"" and his projects range from TVs ""thirtysomething"" to the Oscar-winning ""Glory."" But too many of his pictures are pat and politically predictable. Movies like ""Blood Diamond"" and ""The Last Samurai"" take all the ""right"" stands but wheres the pulse of drama? The shock of art? ""Defiance"" has a sturdy based-on-fact story as three brothers fleeing the Nazi liquidation of their village take to the Byelorussian woods. Eventually theyre joined by other refugees some with guns and a debate ensues Should their priority be survival or resistance? One brother opts for the first building a sort of ever-traveling shtetl; the other chooses the second joining up with a straggling Red Army squadron. Craig and Liev Schreiber are the brothers and although theyre miscast -- theyre the least likely fraternal pair since Adrien Brody and Owen Wilson in ""The Darjeeling Limited"" -- theyre both fine actors. Yet Zwicks script (co-written with Clayton Frohman) seems even if based on fact to be too heavily contrived. The brothers disagreement over tactics seems more a function of the plot than philosophy their reunion a just-in-time Hollywood ending. The idea of refugees taking to the forest and living off the land (and wealthy landowners) has real old-movie appeal; its like Robin Hood and his Merry Menschen. But Zwicks movie never moves behind those cliches. The villain among them has bad teeth while the women remain nicely groomed; Craigs wooden hovel somehow comes complete with glass windows (and fire-lit love scene). Supporting characters feel like kvetching outcasts from Anatevka. For all his armchair humanism Zwick has always had skill with action sequences; an early scene when Craig goes to confront the men who killed his family has a rough power to it and a final battle against the German army is full of excitement. And the characters proactive heroism is an important corrective (as in its own way was ""Munich"") to movies about victimized Jews dependent on righteous gentiles. Many fought back themselves and this is one of the stories. Its just a shame it wasnt told in a faster fresher and more surprising way. Ratings note The film contains violence and strong language.

Everywhere you turn in the movies its swastika flags and SS uniforms. It must be Christmas and though the Holocaust movie has been on hiatus for a while lately it seems as if everyone is trying to squeeze in their Schindlers List before the funding dries up for good. But where are all the Jewish victims? The nearest thing to a traditional Holocaust movie on the menu is Edward Zwicks Defiance about three Jewish brothers who put together a Jewish kibbutz in a Belarus forest the better to survive the war and knock off Nazis and their Russian collaborators.Precious few passive victims there and no victims at all in Bryan Singers Valkyrie a capable brainless thriller in which the Nazis--bless their shiny high boots--inexplicably all have posh British accents except Mr. Cruise who plays the really cool one-eyed one-handed army dude who tries to blow up a depressive little fellow named Hitler. It didnt work out (bummer) but man those action sequences are good and guess what? It really happened--and turns out those Krauts werent quite as efficient about killing their own as they were at mass-murdering those they considered genetically imperfect. Theres one lone Jew (a feckless playboy) in Good a really terrible movie based on what I imagine was a far more interesting 1981 play about a German professor who writes a book about how its all right to kill your very sick loved ones--and who ends up with a Nazi screen credit and a very bad conscience.Jews are the least of it in The Reader about the moral fallout from an affair between a postwar German teenager and a sexy former concentration-camp guard. And The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is actually about a cosseted little Aryan who comes to play ball with a toothless Jewish kid on the other side of the concentration-camp fence. As for Paul Schraders Adam Resurrected in which Jeff Goldblum spends a lot of time on his knees barking its a classic example of how close to impossible it is to bring a complex Holocaust novel to the screen without making it look ridiculous.Weird though it is to remove the powerless half of the catastrophic power equation that was the Third Reich it may be time to detach the Holocaust movie from the culture of victimhood-by-association that has debased it in American popular culture. We seem to have forgotten who the victims really were all six million of them. In a crisply lucid essay for the Jewish cultural magazine Nextbook film critic Stuart Klawans refers us to Todd Solondzs 2001 film Storytelling in which a suburban Jewish family with no direct connection to the Holocaust come to the conclusion over dinner that they too qualify as survivors. Solondz rightly recognizes that the Holocaust--in large part because of the manner in which it is represented--has been cheapened and vulgarized by the victim culture its been drawn into. In the language of Holocaust porn it has become ""my Holocaust"" for those who would be victims too.Klawans goes so far as to call for a moratorium on Holocaust movies. Until now Ive been torn on this one. Growing up Jewish in England on a stiff diet of concentration-camp footage in Hebrew school and BBC war documentaries I knew enough to understand there was more to the Shoah than goose-stepping aggressors preying on noble victims. But I was shocked to discover that a mere decade after the Liberation some of my high school mates had never heard of Hitler and knew next to nothing about the camps.For that reason alone I was a defender of the crassly reductive 1978 Holocaust miniseries on educational grounds. But that was then when outside of documentaries moviemakers on both sides of the Atlantic mostly kept a reverential silence on the Holocaust which was deemed by intellectual gatekeepers including Irving Howe as being beyond the pale of artistic expression. Claude Lanzmanns magisterial 1985 nine-hour Shoah was seen by a few intellectuals but it was Steven Spielberg who broke the silence for mass audiences all over the world in 1993 with Schindlers List. That film--by no means the masterpiece it was hailed to be but instead a decent superbly made attempt to comprehend the heart and mind of a righteous Gentile--opened the sluice gates for fictional films about the Holocaust in and out of the United States.Spielberg cant be held responsible for the sentimentalized atrocity that was Roberto Benignis Life Is Beautiful or for the staggering 170 movies made on the subject since the early 90s. In principle nothing human should be beyond artistic expression. But why are these movies increasingly so awful? Money isnt lacking in Hollywood and neither is sincerity. The industry is quite low on cynics though I have my doubts about Singer whose rabid masculinization of the plot to kill Hitler in Valkyrie--a story so thoroughly stripped of sociopolitical context that we have no idea why the ""good Nazi"" Claus von Stauffenberg wanted the Fuhrer whacked--is rivaled only by his milking of the appeal of Nazism to adolescents in his 1998 Apt Pupil. But one thing Hollywood does have in plentiful supply is amateur historians bent on extracting Positive Lessons for Today from one of the great unexplainable catastrophes of history.Zwick is one of them and if theres one instance of the road to perdition paved with fat budgets and good intentions its Defiance or as I prefer to call it Custerskys Last Stand in Belarus. This fact-based story of three Jewish brothers who set up a forest community of ghetto-massacre survivors while wreaking divine justice on the Krauts and their sympathizers may look like a Holocaust movie--it has lots of extras running around in rags and hollow cheeks--but its really an inquiry into the different management styles of the Yiddish superhero no victim he. Daniel Craig playing his second Jew after Munich with gimlet blue eyes ablaze with leadership potential stars in the do-I-have-to? Gary Cooper role. Liev Schreiber at least looks the part as the belligerent bro whod like to see a little less agonizing and a lot more payback. And Jamie Bell an even more unlikely-looking member of the tribe is the peacemaking youngest brother.While Craig rides around on a white horse mulling whether to kill it for food Schreiber splits off and joins the partisans for some real action only to learn the hard way that Russians are not much keener than Germans on Jews. There are subtitles and vaguely East European accents; there is romance and rebirth tears and regular pauses for gallows humor (at which we Jews are known to be very good on account of our long history of persecution) ""Eez khard to be friend of Jew"" sighs a righteous Gentile. ""Try being one"" the Jew in question snorts.There is at least one audible theme directed at the State of Israel Should a Jew seek vengeance or save lives? (On this matter there was no doubt in the minds of a crowd of older Jewish people at a screening sponsored by the Museum of Tolerance who clapped loudly when the Jews finally stuck it to the Germans and their stoolies.) And lest it be unclear in the text Zwick elaborates in the production notes ""Its a story that compels us to ask ourselves What would I have done in those circumstances?"" This is a question well worth asking in an age when we cluck passively while genocides rage all around us though its hard to see how its addressed in Defiance. Zwick goes on ""And in that way I think it becomes a deeply personal experience [emphasis mine]."" In what way? That we are all by extension victims of the Nazis?Is it weird that the only true Holocaust movie this year thats also pretty good The Counterfeiters (based on the life of a Jewish forger who was far from a saint) came out of Austria which also produced Blind Spot Hitlers Secretary a documentary interview with Hitlers private secretary thats far superior to the similarly themed German film Downfall and is a searing challenge to us all to ask--as Zwick tried to in Defiance--what we would have done under the circumstances? The soul of Germany under Nazism is always worth examining but not much good will come from Good which takes on the potentially interesting question of passive collusion with Nazism but is so incompetently mounted by Brazilian director Vicente Amorim (it takes a clumsy directorial hand to make Viggo Mortensen come on like Sesame Streets Mr. Noodle) as to be utterly incoherent. At the end the stunned professor totters around a remarkably cleaned-up concentration camp seeing the light at last. I mean who knew?Given the record Klawans may be right to call a halt on Holocaust movies. We may not--indeed we may never--be ready to understand the worst genocide in human history so far. The last word may come from the end of The Reader whose narrator comes begging for absolution for the former camp guard he had loved from a Jewish survivor (Lena Olin) who was her victim.

"Review Defiance - LA Times ENTERTAINMENT ENTERTAINMENT Review Defiance NATURAL LEADER Daniel Craig center stars as Tuvia Bielski who with his brothers leads urban Jews into the forests of modern Belarus to escape the Holocaust. Paramount Vantage NATURAL LEADER Daniel Craig stars as Tuvia Bielski who with his brothers leads urban Jews into the forests of modern Belarus to escape the Holocaust. NATURAL LEADER Daniel Craig stars as Tuvia Bielski who with his brothers leads urban Jews into the forests of modern Belarus to escape the Holocaust. (Paramount Vantage) Kenneth Turan FILM CRITIC A Russian partisan commander looks dismissively at the Bielski brothers eyeing tough Zus (Liev Schreiber) and tougher Tuvia (Daniel Craig) and proclaiming ""Jews dont fight.""""These Jews do"" comes the prompt reply and ""Defiance"" the new film by Edward Zwick is determined to prove that point. Though one of the standard cliches of the Holocaust is that Europes Jews were exterminated without offering any resistance historians have gradually uncovered evidence to the contrary with the Bielskis being the prime case in point.Along with sibling Asael (Jamie Bell) the brothers not only formed a partisan unit that took on the Germans in the heavily wooded areas of what is now Belarus they created a community in those woods that managed to keep 1200 Jews alive until the war ended. Zwick who wrote the screenplay with Clayton Frohman based on a book by Nechama Tec has been trying to dramatize that story for at least a dozen years. As it appears on screen today ""Defiance"" has some genuine strengths but also some weaker elements and these opposing traits battle it out kind of the way the contentious Bielskis fought not only the Germans but each other.The strongest part of ""Defiance"" frankly might be those fraternal conflicts. Craig and Schreiber are two excellent actors and both of them connect strongly with their roles as well as their fierce rivalry.We meet all three brothers almost at the same moment in 1941 when they discover that the invading Germans have killed their parents and likely put a price on their own heads as well.Passionately played by Schreiber in one of his strongest film roles Zus is the wild hothead of the family filled with a burning desire for ""blood for blood"" revenge as well as smoldering class resentments against the higher class Jews who looked down on the Bielskis until they needed their help. His brother Tuvia well-played by Craig though capable of cold fury when its called for is much more of a stoic and closer to a natural commander than Zus. He also feels more of a responsibility than his furious sibling does to protect the helpless Jews whove escaped to the woods from urban ghettos.Over the course of several projects particularly the recent ""Blood Diamond"" Zwick has become quite proficient at crisply done action sequences and the frequent fire fights and killings in ""Defiance"" have a powerful effect.Whenever ""Defiance"" departs from the harsher realities of its story however when it leaves behind the particularity of its story and deals with the generic it risks trafficking in the kind of earnestness and sentimentality it is better off without.On the one hand it is appropriate and likely true to life to give each of the Bielskis a beautiful ""forest wife"" the term used for the common law arrangements the war encouraged and having fine actresses like Alexa Davalos Mia Wasikowska and Iben Hjejle certainly helps.On the other hand the film has too much on-the-nose dialogue and wisecracking-through-tough-times sentiments particularly in the dialogue between the religious Shimon Haretz (Allan Corduner) and the intellectual Isaac Malbin (Mark Feuerstein). It all feels like stuff weve heard before and hearing it in the middle of a Belarus forest doesnt improve it enough.But when ""Defiance"" returns to situations that could have come from no other film it strengthens its hand. Being true to itself just as the Bielskis were is what this film does best.kenneth.turanlatimes.com Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Religious Conflicts Civil Unrest Defiance (movie) Judaism Jamie Bell Liev Schreiber Mia Wasikowska James Newton Howard gets violin-happy with Defiance Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-defiance31-2008dec31,0,5333782.story",200,defiance30,defiance,latimes

The story of three Jewish brothers in 1941 Poland who escape the Nazis by taking refuge in the Belorussian forest is hampered by plodding solemnity generic action sequences and cinematic cliches. Still the cinematography by Eduardo Serra is evocative and the main performances -- particularly by Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber as clashing brothers -- are strong. Director Edward Zwick (Blood Diamond) has made a movie that feels like something weve seen before -- and not because there have been several Holocaust-themed films lately. He relies on convention and formula which leaves the film feeling muted rather than gritty like Glory another Zwick historical film. Craig Schreiber and Jamie Bell play the Bielski brothers who join Russian resistance fighters during the Holocaust and protect themselves and others creating a mini-civilization hidden among the thick trees. What emerges is a predictable action-adventure rather than a complex and intimate portrait of a group of courageous individuals fighting for their lives. The larger struggle against the Nazis is undermined by a contest between Craigs Tuvia who has renounced outright vengeance and his hotheaded brother Zus (Schreiber). The youngest Bielski Asael (Bell) is torn between the rivalry of his siblings. Each feels like a ""type"" rather than a fully drawn character and we dont learn enough about the origins of their friction to draw us emotionally into their conflict. The tale of the resistance movement in Belorussia is undeniably inspiring and ideally suited for a cinematic rendering. But Defiance resists bold passionate storytelling and delivers something rather conventional.

"Defiance | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; defiance ) Defiance (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli For some reason the Nazis are popular during the holiday season of 2008. They occupy central positions in Valkyrie and Good flitter around the periphery of The Reader and are rarely seen but very much present in Defiance. Edward Zwicks adaptation of the true-to-life story of Nechama Tecs book about the Bielski partisans this movie is less about the struggle against the Nazis than it is about the fight for survival. Although there are battles Defiance spends most of its time exploring the difficulties of surviving as fugitives in the midst of a Soviet winter. The year is 1941 and the place is Belarus. Hitler is on the move pushing eastward and the Final Solution is underway. The four surviving Beilski brothers - Tuvia (Daniel Craig) Zus (Liev Schreiber) Asael (Jamie Bell) and Aron (George MacKay) - are forced to hide in the woods after the local police in collaboration with the Germans kill the rest of the family. But the Beilskis time on the run is not destined to be spent alone. Like moths to the flame other Jewish refugees are drawn to them until they are more like a dispossessed community than a ragtag group. The bigger the camp gets the more problems arise. Tuvia and Zus openly clash with the former advocating a largely peaceful philosophy and the latter wanting to get bloody. Disease starvation and cold threaten health and lives as the autumn deepens into winter. And the Germans are on the hunt offering a reward and seeking the location where Tuvia and the Bielski partisans are holed up. The principal flaw of Defiance is that some of the high-minded sentiments voiced by Tuvia in flowery speeches seem too noble and unrealistic for the circumstances. Also while theres nothing specifically wrong with Daniel Craigs performance it can be a little difficult accepting the actor as a Jew. One suspects Craigs participation in the film might have been a concession to its getting the financing needed. After all the rest of the cast is not populated by household names. Although Craig has the lions share of the screen time as well as the plum role Liev Schreiber provides the most memorable performance - a forceful turn as the conflicted least idealistic of the Beilski brothers. The battle scenes are well choreographed and contain enough uncertainty to make them genuinely exciting but one would expect no less from a man who has overseen Civil War engagements (Glory) and Japanese strife (The Last Samurai). More compelling however is the drama associated with the establishment and maintenance of the Bielski partisans refugee camp situated deep in a forest during one of the most inhospitable times of the year. Not only are there problems with famine brought on by the inability to grow anything in the freezing cold but an epidemic of typhus runs rampant through the community. Zwick re-creates each new crisis with immediacy and doesnt bypass other less life-and-death elements of life faith in God under such trying circumstances; love sex and marriage (three of the four brothers become emotionally connected to female refugees); and the friction that occurs between the Bielski group and other partisans in the area. The TV ads for Defiance make it seem like the movie centers on a series of guerilla attacks on the Nazis but in reality those moments are a small part of the wider tapestry Zwick has stitched together out of a combination of true history and dramatic license. Defiance makes explicit the parallelism between a group of Jews fleeing from Nazi death squads and the Exodus. One rabbi prays that God will release the Jews from the curse of being the chosen people so they can stop running and being persecuted. However the film runs the risk of overplaying its hand when one character remarks on the lack of supernatural intervention in parting the waters during a journey through swamplands. Central to the films effectiveness is the transformation of Tuvia from idealist to pragmatist. While he never reaches the level of callousness and brutality displayed by Zus events force him to reconsider the price of showing mercy. Craig handles the performance well enough for us to believe this character development but this isnt his best work (for my money that can be found in either Layer Cake or Casino Royale). Ultimately the film works not just because of the character arc it provides for its main character but for its ultimate theme of the triumph over adversity. In Exodus Moses led the Hebrews out of captivity. Who would have suspected that in this tale the role of Moses would be played by James Bond?

Good Films Good Director Vincente AmorimGenre DramaRunning Time 96 min Unrated Nazis Nazis everywhere you look ... must be Oscar season where most of the Nazis will have British accents. Tom Cruise is positively surrounded by Brits in Valkyrie as he plays with a flat American accent Col. Claus von Stauffenberg a high-ranking German officer who masterminded a plot to assassinate Hitler. We meet him a few years earlier though in North Africa in a sequence loaded with explosions and divebombing fighter planes. This sequence is all over the movies trailers because its action in a war movie that otherwise mostly involves people talking urgently into telephones. Directed by Bryan Singer who made the X-Men movies Valkyrie does look good and there is a certain intrigue in watching how von Stauffenbergs plot went wrong -- I dont think Im spoiling anything here; Hitler was not assassinated. But as action movies go Valkyrie is pretty short on action. Thats not true of Defiance the story of the Bielski partisans in the eastern part of what was once Poland now known as Belarus. These Jewish partisans armed themselves and managed to hide more than a thousand Jews for several years in densely wooded territory. Its an inspiring story if one that doesnt need quite as much poetic inspiration as Ed Zwicks movie insists on giving it with dialogue thats too often ornate and parable-inflected. This is not out of keeping with Zwicks other war movies -- Glory and The Last Samurai among them -- but in Defiance it has the effect of pushing a striking true story in the direction of hokey Hollywood ones. Oddly what you miss in both Defiance and Valkyrie despite all the chest-thumping warriors is inner conflict. Both films feature protagonists who arent very interesting because they have not an instant of self-doubt. Theyre saintly fighting evil ... figures in historical pageants not characters in a drama. You want drama go to a dramatist. English playwright C.P. Taylor wrote a play called Good that caused quite a stir with its portrayal of a liberal German professor in the 1930s. Played by Viggo Mortensen in the movie the professor is summoned by a Nazi official and is startled to discover that a novel he wrote years ago -- about a loving husband who helps his terminally ill wife end her suffering -- has found favor with the Third Reich. In soothing tones the chairman of the Nazi Party Censorship Committee praises the books approach to the issue of whether individuals have an absolute right to life and then leads the professor a little further down a dangerous path urging him to write a paper articulating his views. This says the official will ensure that ""humanity"" remains at the center of the partys agenda. The implications in hindsight are obvious to the audience but this is early in the Nazi era -- 1937 -- and the uses to which his paper on euthanasia might be put by the Reich slip by the frightened professor. He agrees to write the paper and -- reluctantly -- to join the Nazi Party. By going along the professor finds himself prospering but each seemingly inconsequential choice he makes gets him in deeper. The plot in Good is more or less a dramatization of the notion that ""the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing."" The movie Good is pretty schematic in laying out that notion -- betraying its theatrical roots perhaps. Its also a little drawn out. But it demonstrates the surprising power of character flaws in drama. How else to explain that the portrayal of a good man who does nothing in Good should prove more dramatically compelling than the stories in Valkyrie and Defiance of good men who did good?

A potentially exceptional story is told in a flatly unexceptional manner in ""Defiance."" True-life yarn of a band of Jewish brothers who led a small but resilient resistance movement against the Nazis in Belorussia during World War II seems like such a natural for the bigscreen that its surprising its never cropped up before. But Edward Zwicks version of the grim but inspirational events becomes more conventional as it goes topped by a climax straight out of countless war pics and Westerns. Presence of Daniel Craig and Liev Schreiber in tough macho guise will attract some action fans and Holocaust-related theme will draw others but overall commercial prospects appear modest. By focusing on a handful of tough rural guys who no matter the overwhelming odds choose to take their chances living in a dense forest and hit the Germans when they can rather than go quietly ""Defiance"" seems explicitly designed to counter the prevailing image of Jews acquiescing to their fates in ghettoes or camps without fighting back. Most of the time such resistance was impossible but the film based on a 1993 book by historian Nechama Tec turns the spotlight on an instance in which resourcefulness tenacity and heroism resulted in 1200 Jews emerging from the woods at wars end. Zwick has examined little-known historical incidents before notably in ""Glory"" and ""Defiance"" has the advantage of centering upon three brothers the Bielskis Tuvia (Craig) a smuggler who returns after the Nazis have rampaged through their area in August 1941 killing family members along with many others; Zus (Schreiber) the so-called ""wild one""; and the considerably younger Asael (Jamie Bell) whose tender sensibilities toughen up in a hurry. Tuvia undergoes his baptism of blood by killing the local police chief who murdered his father but then renounces further revenge missions having decided that ""our revenge is to live."" However Zus wants to eliminate local collaborators and their guerrilla tactics enable them to take out some Nazis as well scooping up additional arms in the process. Others find their way to the brothers remote camp which soon resembles a community complete with religious figures a bespectacled ""intellectual"" love interests for the brothers and most crucially more fighters. The groups numbers are further swollen after Tuvia and Asael visit a nearby urban Jewish ghetto and spirit out many volunteers. But the restless Zus dubious about Tuvias ability to capably head the group and anxious for direct action splits with his brother and joins a group of partisans operating nearby under the Red Army banner. Forced to move after having been discovered by the Germans Tuvias group builds a new hidden village while Tuvia whos not exactly a born leader tries to inspire his people with a sense of purpose -- ""to live free like human beings for as long as we can"" -- and prepare for the winter. Through roughly the first half viewer goodwill and interest are piqued by the storys basic circumstances the promise that at least some of these characters will find a way to prevail Craig and Schreibers rugged appeal and the muted beauty of Eduardo Serras blue- green- and gray-infused location cinematography in the forests of Lithuania. But through the remaining hour-plus of the script by Clayton Frohman and Zwick -- as malnourishment and illness hit the community romances blossom Zus wrestles with whether to stick with the Russians or return to the fold and Tuvia faced with aerial bombing and approaching Nazi troops must lead his people like Moses across water to safety -- it all becomes pretty standard-issue stuff filled with noble and tragic heroism familiar battle images and last-second rescues. None of the suffering sacrifices anxieties or tests of heart and soul are rendered with any special dimension or heightened force nor depicted with anything near the staggering hallucinatory impact of the two great Russian films to have depicted events in wartime Belorussia Larisa Shepitkos 1977 ""The Ascent"" and her husband Elem Klimovs 1985 ""Come and See."" Zwick has made the debatable decision to have all the actors deliver their dialogue in English with a roughly Slavic-cum-Russian accent then speak (subtitled) Russian when the occasion demands it. Given the odd disorientation this provokes one wonders if the accents were worth the trouble. His brilliant blue eyes emphasized to make them positively glow at times Craig acquits himself manfully as a flawed limited fellow struggling to find leadership qualities within himself. But to really pay off the part should have been provided with more explicit subtext; if Tuvia really was a criminal before the war his past could have been brought to bear more meaningfully on his new role in life. Were he and his brothers the local equivalent of hillbilly rubes as might be surmised from the attitudes of the more learned members of their flock? If so some helpful humor might have ensued. And how deeply and far back did the animosity between Tuvia and Zus run? Many details and useful distinctions that would have helped individualize and define the main characters are glossed over. Schreibers fierceness and sheer physicality have rarely been so amply emphasized and they allow him to dominate whenever hes onscreen. Bell effectively etches Asaels quickly earned maturity; Alexa Davalos Iben Hjejle and Mia Wasikowska all have their warm moments as women who attach themselves to Tuvia Zus and Asael respectively; and Ravil Isyanov as the Peoples Army leader and Martin Hancock as an ill-mannered lout stand out among the large supporting cast. Productions physical details are well managed and James Newton Howards violin-dominated score provides mournfully moody dramatic backing.
