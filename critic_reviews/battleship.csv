Comments (1) click to enlarge Battleship Video Rated PG-13  131 minutes  2012 Heres a tough assignment for any self-respecting director a Transformers knock-off board-game adaptation and military recruitment film all rolled into one. Peter Berg (Hancock Friday Night Lights) does his best with the material adopting an unfashionably earnest tone and a Fordian depiction of military families. He also sets a tempo markedly slower than Michael Bays suggesting an affinity with more old-fashioned Hollywood entertainment (the first half hour even references The Best Years of Our Lives and Jerry Lewiss The Bellboy). But once the special effects take over Berg has little room to assert his personality (or tell a story for that matter) and the movie feels like a chore. With Taylor Kitsch Liam Neeson and pop singer Rihanna all pretty likable.

As the great Anton Ego notes at the conclusion of Pixars Ratatouille the critic--in any field--thrives on well criticism. Negative reviews are relatively easy to write and often great fun to read. I confess that it was with this in mind that I decided to attend a screening of Battleship. This summer after all holds out the promise of astonishingly few sure-fire stinkers. The Dark Knight Rises Brave Prometheus Snow White and the Huntsman Rock of Ages Total Recall The Bourne Legacy--some will no doubt disappoint but all share at least the possibility of being solid entertainments if not more. Anyone looking for a film truly worthy of a critical broadside would be a fool to forsake so large a target as Battleship.Battleship has a few likable gags and a hokey genial air particularly in comparison to the sour tone of its Hasbro cousin.The omens could hardly have been bleaker. Start with the initial plan to turn a 45-year-old board game--which had been a pencil-and-paper game for a generation before that--into a 200 million summer tent-pole despite its complete lack of plot or characters. (Whats next? Hangman? Wait forget I said that.) Then there was the notion to depart from the entire premise of the game--two evenly matched maritime fleets stalking one another--in order to substitute an invasion by an alien armada. (Was George Lucas employed as an uncredited creative consultant?) And finally there was the decision to open the film abroad five weeks before it opened stateside which is a bit like premiering a big Broadway play in rural Manitoba. The movies title sequence is hardly any more promising twice advertising loudly that what we are about to watch is a Hasbro property. (What could possibly go wrong?) After a bit of halfhearted exposition--astronomers find an Earthlike planet orbiting a distant sun; they try to contact it ignoring the lone naysayer who cautions that any life there might prove unfriendly--we find ourselves in a bar. There Stone Hopper (upright Naval commander played by Alexander Skarsgard) is lecturing his brother Alex (hotheaded layabout played by Taylor Kitsch) on the importance of doing something with his life when in walks Sam Shane (Sports Illustrated swimsuit model-like blonde played by Sports Illustrated swimsuit model Brooklyn Decker). Sam wants a chicken burrito and when the bartender tells her that the kitchens closed (thwack slams the microwave door) Alex decides that what he wants to do with his life is to get her one. To that end he engages in criminal trespass larceny and the extreme (if inadvertent) vandalism of a nearby convenience store. But he gets Sam her burrito even if he has to hand it to her while being brutally tasered by police. Its actually a moderately amusing sequence especially for anyone who recalls the viral video of a genuine theft on which Alexs antics are loosely based. MORE ON MOVIES The Middling Hilarity of The Dictator The Deathly Dullness of Dark Shadows Our Picks for Which Film to See Each Week of Summer The Astonishing Avengers Cut to an undisclosed time later. Alex is now a clean-cut naval lieutenant stationed in Hawaii and he is planning to propose to Sam as soon as he can get permission from her stern admiral father (Liam Neeson). Alexs felonious indiscretions on behalf of Sams burrito are not mentioned again nor is it explained how he avoided incarceration and became an officer. If youre the kind of person who asks such questions this is probably not the movie for you. Naval maneuvers involving the fleets of several countries (hello international market) are about to take place but not until after the completion of a soccer tournament (hello? hello?). The maneuvers have scarcely begun though when several alien objects fall from the sky one of them tearing a large hole in the middle of Hong Kong(). The remaining extraterrestrial dreadnoughts meanwhile land in the Pacific and project an impenetrable force-field over Hawaii trapping with them three destroyers commanded by the two Hopper brothers and one Captain Nagata played by Japanese star (okay Im done) Tadanobu Asano. Also notably on board is a tough petty officer played by Rihanna in her big-screen debut. Hostilities soon ensue between the multinational cast and the extraterrestrials--who lets face it were never going to buy tickets to this movie anyway. In a nod to the board game that will elicit grins or groans according to temperament the aliens primary weapon launches missiles shaped like pegs which embed themselves in a ships hull before exploding. Also their force-field has crippled the radar of both sides alike forcing them to ""guess"" at their opponents exact locations.If this all sounds pretty bad--well it is though not quite as bad as one might expect. The movie has a few likable gags (a couple of them about The Art of War) and a hokey genial air particularly in comparison to the sour tone of its Hasbro cousin the Transformers franchise. Yes Brooklyn Decker is cast as eye candy and accoutered accordingly--tank tops and bikini tops short jean shorts and short lycra shorts--but director Peter Bergs camera never leers over her like the lubricious lens of Michael Bay. (And at least Battleship had the decency to make Sam her character a physical therapist rather than a biochemist or art historian.) You may find over time as I did that you are worn down by the Learning of Valuable Lessons; by the aliens peculiar repeated habit of declining to finish off helpless foes (is it still Battleship if only one side is playing to win?); by the bringing back of grizzled old vets for one last tour; by the appalling misappropriation of ""Fortunate Son""; and by the pummeling punishing score (by Steve Jablonsky with producer Rick Rubin and guitarist Tom Morello) which bears all too close a resemblance to the deadly sonic weapon deployed by the aliens early in the film.In short if you are in the market for a big-budget action movie this weekend see The Avengers. If youve already seen it see it again. But if youve seen it as many times as you can bear and you absolutely need to go out to an aliens-versus-humanity blockbuster--no I cant go that far.But I will say this Battleship is substantially less awful than it could have been. And for me writing from the selfish perspective of someone who anticipated a movie meriting true critical evisceration that may have been the biggest disappointment of all.

He has written on movies for The New Republic LA Weekly Salon and The New York Sun and has worked as an editor for numerous publications. Twitter previousA Crackdown in Crayon Bahrains Children Draw Their Countrys CrisisnextWhy Attacking Rev. Wright Is Too Risky for the Romney Campaign Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Gary Cameron / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 62 A Man Who Can Be Baited With a Tweet James Fallows None Last night in her overall very successful acceptance speech Hillary Clinton said with ruthless precision about her opponent Ask yourself Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride. Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P. McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Mark Kauzlarich / Reuters How Chelsea Beat Ivanka at Being a Candidate Daughter Michelle Cottle The comparatively less flashy less spirited former First Kid managed to show her moms softer side at the DNC on Thursday. Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side.

Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz. Continue Reading richie0703 / Fotolia / 360b / Shutterstock / The Atlantic The Curious Rise of Scientology in Taiwan Benjamin Carlson A church facing setbacks elsewhere finds an unlikely foothold. At the end of 2013 in the low-slung industrial Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung a bevy of officials came to attend the ribbon cutting of a huge former hotel that had undergone a top-to-bottom multimillion-dollar renovation. Speaking before the throngs of celebrants who blocked the flow of traffic Taiwans deputy director of the Ministry of the Interior praised the group that funded the renovation and presented them for the 10th year straight with the national ""Excellent Religious Group"" award. ""For years you have dedicated your time and lives to anti-drug work and human- rights dissemination"" said the director echoing praise offered by the mayors office and the presidents national-policy adviser. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters The Most Inspiring and Depressing Moment of the Democratic Convention Uri Friedman The father of a Muslim American who died in Iraq confronts Donald Trump. Khizr Khan began his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday with words I wish he didnt have to say ""Tonight we are honored to stand here as parents of Captain Humayun Khan and as patriotic American Muslims--as patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country."" I wish he and his wife didnt have to stand there as the parents of a 27-year-old Army captain who was killed by suicide bombers while serving in the Iraq War. And I wish Khizr Khan hadnt felt the need to declare his patriotism and loyalty to the United States of America. Those truths should have been self-evident. The state of the union is not strong when an American feels compelled to clarify such things. In better times Khizr Khan who was born in Pakistan and moved to America from the United Arab Emirates might have begun his speech with what he said next ""Like many immigrants we came to this country empty-handed. We believed in American democracy--that with hard work and [the] goodness of this country we could share in and contribute to its blessings."" Continue Reading Jo Naylor / Flickr An Exciting History of Drywall Haniya Rae Its a staple in American homes but at what environmental cost? As Hurricane Katrina raged through New Orleans in 2005 neighborhood after neighborhood collapsed from flooding. Of the houses that stood many still had to be bulldozed due to mold within the walls. But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon. Continue Reading Reuters Trump Time Capsule 63 Whats In the Tax Returns? James Fallows None Mark Salter former chief of staff to Sen. John McCain has written an essay for Real Clear Politics on why he cannot vote for Donald Trump. It deserves note for the long-term record because this is not how associates of a partys former nominee usually talk about the current one and because of its insistence on the importance of tax returns. Salter concludes (emphasis added) Could it be that a major party nominee for president is beholden to Russias leader and might compromise the security interests of the U.S. and our allies to maintain that relationship?  We dont know the answer.... We cant begin to answer the question until Trump releases his tax returns for the last several years. The media should make this the focus of every interview with Trump and senior Trump staff. The Republican Party chairman should urge him to release his returns. The Republican leadership in Congress should insist on it. Every American voter should demand it. There are legitimate suspicions about whether Trumps business relationships could compromise his loyalty to our country. Unless and until he puts them to rest not by dismissing them but by disproving them he should be considered unfit to hold the office of president. Continue Reading Zak Bickel / The Atlantic From Whitewater to Benghazi A Clinton-Scandal Primer David A. Graham The State Department is reopening its investigation into Hillary Clintons emails just as she puts a Justice Department investigation behind her. Hillary Clinton is out of the frying pan and into the fire. On July 6 Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that the Justice Department would not pursue criminal charges against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for her use of a private email server at the State Department. But the following day with that criminal investigation closed the State Department reopened its own probe into the emails the AP reported. State Department spokesman John Kirby told the AP that it would be looking at potential mishandling of classified information by Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Former officials could face administrative sanctions including a loss of their security clearances--a step that would be both politically embarrassing for Clinton and complicate efforts to staff a national-security team should she prevail in November.

Universal Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Think youre a film buff? Take our movie trivia quiz Video Battleship trailer Monitor Movie Guide Not being an aficionado of the grid-based Hasbro board game Battleship I cant comment on how closely ""Battleship"" the movie replicates it. But if the movie is anything like the game I say stay at home and read a good book (or graphic novel). Or listen to an audiobook - In short do anything else.It seems the world is being invaded by aliens and only the intrepid US Navy led by ex-slacker/newly minted hero Alex Hopper can stop them. Hopper is played by Taylor Kitsch fresh from his searing appearance in the megaflop ""John Carter."" The aliens when stripped of their helmets or whatever it is they are encased in resemble pasty-faced Uncle Sams complete with chin whiskers. I guess theres a message there somewhere.Helping out in the rescue mission is Rihanna playing apparently the only woman in the entire Navy. Making a late appearance is a cadre of Pearl Harbor vets. This part of the movie comes across like ""Cocoon"" with kabooms. Peter Berg (""Friday Night Lights"") directed. I never thought Id say this as a criticism but hes no Michael Bay. The script is replete with howlers. My favorite from Kitsch after the aliens strike ""Ive got a bad feeling about this."" Indeed.

"" -Richard Roeper MOVIE INFORMATION Battleship(2012; PG-13)In theaters Friday 18 May 2012Genre Action Science Fiction ThrillerCast Alexander Skarsgard Brooklyn Decker Liam Neeson New Richard Roeper reviews weekdays at 500 PM ET only on REELZCHANNEL (6) Post a Comment  Toddsaid on Friday January 23 2015 65202 PMHorrible movie. Overly dramatic pauses...No one in this movie ever moves quickly when its needed. Characters stupidly stand in place when danger is approaching. Some of the worst dialogue ever the screenwriters should be embarrassed. Jayknowsflickssaid on Saturday April 13 2013 50657 AMWhat questions did ""Battleship"" answer? Because Im fairly certain it was none. Primarily due to its lack of plot and character development. Why were the Aliens attacking? Why didnt they communicate in some manner? Why did they spare certain Humans? Nothing was explained at all. This is by far one of the absolute worst films Ive ever seen and Ive seen some stinkers. Liam Neeson should be ashamed. He should have pissed on the script and then fired his agent for offering it. You want to talk about ""Prometheus"". Well that film looks like ""Citizen Kane"" compared to this garbage Heck ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" looks like ""Citizen Kane"" compared to this At least it has SOME redeeming value Dlinkysaid on Sunday December 09 2012 12707 PMIts hilarious that someone could be so upset that a movie like Battleship got a bad review. Anyone who liked this film so much that they would spend time defending it online is either very young or very dumb. Justin Foremansaid on Friday September 14 2012 95806 PMThis movie was not that bad. I feel like the story was rushed and dry but the movie made you feel good and that is what a movie should do. SaneMoviegoersaid on Monday June 11 2012 115036 AMHow was this movie ""stupid"" but Prometheus ""stunning""??? At least Battleship answered all the questions that it raised in the movie while it can be said that Prometheus was too STUPID to answer a single one. You confuse me Sir. Crazy Daveysaid on Saturday May 19 2012 102721 PM""It is completely and utterly ridiculous."" Shocked? Not really. I knew this was going to be crap as soon as I seen the first trailer... I cant wait to see what the Lego movie is gonna look like Love Liam Neeson though. Hes always awesome no matter how bad a movie can be.

Screen grab from the online trailer for the film ""Battleship"" starring Alexander Skarsgard Taylor Kitsch Brooklyn Decker and Liam Neeson Movies Battleship The official trailer Rihanna poses with a USS George Washington cap during a photocall of a promotion event of her debut movie ""Battleship"" aboard the aircraft carrier at the U.S. 7th Fleets headquarters in Yokosuka near Tokyo Monday April 2 2012. Koji Sasahara / AP Movies Video Rihanna talks about Battleship But finally a new entry has emerged attempting to unite turn-based strategy naval and sci-fi fanatics worldwide. Can Battleship make an unscathed transition from your cousins basement to the silver screen? Battleship was invented in the postwar 1940s as a pencil-and-paper game involving the strategic or random placement of ships of varying sizes on a 10-by-10 grid. One attempts to select - or ""fire a missile"" at - a co-ordinate inhabited by one of the other players ships. It was souped-up in the sixties - becoming an actual board with plastic ships - and in the eighties with whiz-bang ""talking"" electronics and a memorable TV commercial featuring a dejected father moaning to his gleeful winning son ""You sank my battleship"" The movie version shares the games simplicity random plotting and strategic marketing but mainly this Battleship gives new meaning to the in-name-only adaptation pitting a surprise armada of violent alien ships from ""Planet G"" against the Earth-defending U.S. Navy which thought it had a fun day ahead of playing international ""war games."" Battleship has its moments like the rare occasions when it nods to its origin Theres a nice eureka when we learn that evil alien ships can be outwitted improbably by plotting co-ordinates on a grid a la your granddads board game. Even cheesier a retired old clunker of a battleship eventually gets to shine in the face of adversity - as do elderly veterans a determined real-life amputee named Mick (Gregory D. Gadson) a racially persecuted Japanese captain named Nagata (Tadanobu Asanu) nerdy NASA guys and pop singer Rihannas Gatling-gun-toting Die Hard-quoting Officer Raikes. There are several pat and predictable reconciliations between characters and too much uninteresting dialogue about ""mysterious"" aliens to wade through - plus oodles of nauseating jingoism and slow-motion heroism. Also disappointing is the scant presence of Liam Neeson as the admiral in charge of the fleet. The plot involves the admirals objection to the relationship between misfit Lieutenant Hopper a by-the-numbers bad-boy heartthrob played by Taylor Kitsch and his daughter Sam played by Esquire-approved ""sexiest woman"" Brooklyn Decker and its thoroughly telegraphed from the get-go. One can be sure that heroic characters get what they want bond with enemies and earn respect. Theres not a lot of tension between aliens and humans either. Skillful conductors of mayhem director Peter Berg and his music composer Steve Jablonsky try to manipulate the audience by alternating from victories to defeats with music that slows down to incorporate mournful bugles. At least the alien missiles look like the pegs from the board game.

Photo AP All I expected out of ""Battleship"" was a stupid action movie. Its more than that though Its also a stupid comedy and a stupid sci-fi yarn. It makes ""Top Gun"" look like the work of Orson Welles. At least the Tom Cruise movie remembered to cast actual actors. Mashing in ideas from ""Independence Day"" and ""Transformers"" the movie goes awry immediately with a would-be hilarious character intro about greasy-haired neer-do-well Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch) committing a felony to score a burrito for a hot girl (Brooklyn Decker) in a bar. His naval-officer brother Stone (Alexander Skarsgaard) sees officer material in this and browbeats his callow sibling into joining the Navy -- which generally doesnt take felons although that development isnt as absurd as the notion that women who look like Brooklyn Decker hang around alone in dive bars eating burritos. Somehow a blink of an eye later Alex is both the biggest foul-up in the Navy and yet also an important officer in the fleet commanded by his new girlfriends dad (Liam Neeson who has maybe 10 minutes of screen time). During a naval exercise off Pearl Harbor called RIMPAC which to me sounds more like some kind of porno lobbying outfit the two Hoppers discover that alien attackers have ripped apart Hong Kong and sent mysterious vessels into the Pacific rigged to go off at the exact moment a sailor comes knocking and asking if anybodys home. PHOTOS BROOKLYN DECKER AND MORE STARS COMPETING AGAINST THEMSELVES AT THE BOX OFFICE Pleasing as it is to contemplate an end-of-the-world scenario in which New York gets hit last these aliens are hard to take seriously. Theyre essentially just tall dudes in Boba Fett armor with goatees. Despite their superior intelligence they prove easily felled by such tricks as being walloped with a suitcase by a NASA geek. Whats more unforgivable is that by firing grenades and balls of fire everywhere they can pretty much destroy the entire fleet right away but instead they hang back and allow the Americans to figure out their weaknesses. (It turns out they cant deal with sunlight. Really. Even the extraterrestrials in ""Signs"" who couldnt handle water probably laughed at these guys in alien middle school.) Kitsch (a former model) registers very low on the charisma scale but at least hes better than the pop stars and models around him. The swimsuit model Decker is not now and never will be an actress while Rihanna as the ships gunner proves her equal in vapidity. As destruction rains around her and the end of the world approaches she spends the movie looking as if shes waiting for her assistant to fetch her a latte. Asian star Tadanobu Asano as a Japanese officer working with the Americans struggles with English and has little energy left to act. Meanwhile as a background sailor who carries the ships log of stale wisecracks Jesse Plemons of ""Friday Night Lights"" (also the source of Kitsch and the films director Peter Berg) does the same whimsical-nerd shtick that was charming on the TV show for several years but now seems as ancient as a board game played with pegs and little plastic ships. Yet one of the two semi-exciting scenes in the movie consists of the actors sitting around and actually playing the game for which the film is named (Foxtrot 24 Miss) on a video grid they use to track the alien ships. The other great moment which is so emotionally rich I temporarily thought it would rescue the movie evokes the Navys majestic WWII legacy but even that is soon pushed aside in favor of such idiocy as Decker suddenly becoming an expert stunt driver and using her SUV to defeat aliens by ramming into their equipment on shore. Its the kind of movie that contains both the line ""I didnt sign up for this bulls - - t"" and (after aliens have already killed thousands of people) ""I have a bad feeling about this."" The NASA geek keeps warning (with no justification) that when the aliens arrive itll be like Columbus and the Indians only ""were the Indians."" Between ""Battleship"" and ""Transformers"" its the first that seems more like the effort of a primitive culture.

Starring Taylor Kitsch Rihanna Liam Neeson Director Peter Berg Running time 211 Release Opened May 18 2012  Editorial Review An intrepid vessel with firepowerBy Michael OSullivanFriday May 18 2012 Battleship -- Hasbros venerable game of naval strategy in which players use a combination of guesswork and logic to deduce the location of their opponents ships -- isnt exactly known for its thrill-a-minute narrative complexity. So its understandable if some moviegoers might approach the new action-adventure film inspired by it with the same trepidation they would feel about ""Yahtzee The Movie."" Fear not. ""Battleship"" is an invigorating blast of cinematic adrenaline. Deftly directed by Peter Berg (""Friday Night Lights"") from a script by brothers Eric and Jon Hoeber (""Red"") that adds muscle sinew and heart to the skeletal source material the resulting film is an enormously entertaining amusement-park ride. Yes its a bit preposterous not to mention loud. But its also brisk and viscerally thrilling with a genuine surprise or two -- including a plot twist that manages to brilliantly incorporate the games essential DNA of blindly shooting at invisible targets. Its the most fun anyone could ever have staring at a grid of blinking dots. Of course the story is about more than trying to sink someones unseen battleship. Especially because the ""someone"" in this case is an alien armada that has splashed down in the waters off Hawaii. As with most extraterrestrials since ""The War of the Worlds"" they have not come in peace. Responding to the threat is the U.S. Navy personified by the crew of the destroyer John Paul Jones and its captain Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch). A young untested lieutenant who is unexpectedly thrust into the role of leader when the aliens initial attack leaves him the senior officer standing Hopper and his ship are left to face the aliens and separated from the rest of the fleet -- from the rest of the world really -- by a domelike force field. This of course sets up the cat-and-mouse-like maneuvers that are at the heart of both the game and the movie. The alien vessels which hop about on the surface of the ocean like aquatic insects are impervious to our radar. And certain anatomical peculiarities of the aliens vision also make it difficult for them to fully ""see"" us. Their ""Terminator""-like scanning ability seems to allow them to identify military hardware more readily than people. Several elements add depth and texture to this straightforward set-up including Hoppers inferiority complex about his older more seasoned brother (Alexander Skarsgard) a straight-arrow naval commander whose fate early in the film precipitates his little brothers reluctant maturation. Hopper also has a honey Sam (Brooklyn Decker) back in Hawaii a physical therapist at a veterans hospital whose work with a double amputee (real-life Army Col. Gregory D. Gadson making his acting debut) plays a critical role in the ensuing battle. Gadson is no Laurence Olivier but he makes an appealing hero. Sam also happens to be the daughter of an admiral (a gruffly appealing if less than essential Liam Neeson). Rather than encumbering the story these added ingredients mainly enrich it. So too do the circumstances of the films climax a flat-out fun and shamelessly stirring twist that involves a group of World War II vets and a decommissioned battleship. Its been decades since the Navy actually used one of those steam-powered behemoths -- as opposed to the more modern class of destroyer seen most often in the film -- but what ""Battleship"" worth its salt could be made without one? The movies themes of sacrifice heroism and honor -- especially the respect for tradition -- may be corny and old-fashioned but what can I say? They still work. Mostly however its the action that propels this fleet film forward. Like its naval namesake ""Battleship"" may be bulky long and overblown but when it gets in the water its as nimble as a speedboat. Sure it may be beset by a few cliches -- along with aliens -- but in the end it manages to outmaneuver them all.Contains action violence mayhem and some obscenity.

Photo Frank Masi Universal Pictures Image 11 of 11 Battleship review Sinks under its own weight 1 / 11 Back to Gallery Battleship Action. Starring Taylor Kitsch Liam Neeson and Brooklyn Decker. Directed by Peter Berg. (PG-13. 131 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Before anyone gets all high and mighty about films based on board games (planned for 2013 Adam Sandlers ""Candy Land"") let us recall that ""Clue"" really wasnt that bad. Bits of it were even good - especially when Madeline Kahn described the flames of hatred engulfing her head. Sadly Kahn is nowhere to be found in ""Battleship"" a humongous alien-invasion flick based on the plastic-pegged Hasbro naval guessing game. Its loud its large its stupid and its best gag involves a chicken burrito. It features Taylor Kitsch wearing many more clothes and maybe one more facial expression than he did in ""John Carter."" ""Battleship"" was written by brothers Jon and Erich Hoeber and directed by Peter Berg (""Friday Night Lights"" ""Hancock"") a bristly and interesting chronicler of the masculine realm who gets sidetracked this time by machismo. Who-cares subplots involve Kitschs girlfriend (Brooklyn Decker) her daddy the admiral (Liam Neeson losing the battle with his Irish brogue) a fidgety scientist (Hamish Linklater) and a courageous Army veteran (double amputee Gregory D. Gadson) who utters the films worst lines with the most conviction (although Rihanna playing a petty officer comes darn close). Most of the story occurs in Hawaii where Navy maneuvers are interrupted when aliens from a distant planet respond to a beacon by dropping in for a visit. Through jerks in the plot too pointless to explain the survival of the human race depends upon an idiot/slacker naval officer with major impulse-control problems. Specifically Kitsch. ""Battleship"" hasnt much to do with Battleship. Or battleships - although the decommissioned USS Missouri does play a crucial role with a last of guns and gumption when humanity is most in need. Despite all the missiles crashing into all the vessels the film is less concerned with naval warfare than Kitschs pinch-browed close-ups and a snarling metal soundtrack that cranks it up whenever sailors do the chesty work of whupping alien butt. In the olden days extraterrestrials often had a reason for coming and even assumed a paternalistic tone but these guys dont bother offering a rationale. Neither do the screenwriters. The invaders mission seems to be put an electromagnetic bubble over the Pacific; sink a few ships; kill a few of the more bothersome earthlings; and oh yeah make a phone call.

"Sink this Battleship Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Aliens can have this BattleshipAn alien invasion that only the U.S. Navy can stop may sound exciting but its not. Especially when its a 200-million-plus film version of the popular board game.May 18 2012|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Tadanobu Asano and Taylor Kitsch in a scene from ""Battleship."" (Universal Pictures )""Battleship""is not the first major motion picture to be based on a board game a who could forget 1985s benighted ""Clue""? a but it is surely the most expensive.With every superhero more celebrated than Amazing-Man or the Chameleon already spoken for (ditto for hot toys like Transformers) Hollywood has fallen back on popular games as likely fodder for action epics. If ""Scrabble The Movie"" or ""Qwirkle or Death"" appears on a future marquee dont say you werent warned.As its north-of-200-million budget indicates ""Battleship"" has been expanded considerably from its origins as a pre-World War I pencil and paper game to include a major alien invasion that puts the very fate of the human race at stake. Only the stalwartU.S. Navy stands in the way of what a nervous bureaucrat calls ""an extinction event."" This may sound thrilling but its not.The infusion of all that cash notwithstanding ""Battleship"" plays ordinary and pedestrian because its always been a job for hire never anyones passion. Powerhouse toymaker Hasbro ordered up a movie based on one of its most popular games and everyone from director Peter Berg and screenwriters Jon Hoeber and Erich Hoeber on down tried as hard as they could to fulfill the order. But thats hardly a recipe for excitement.The only person avid about anything was Berg the son of a naval historian whose unbounded enthusiasm for all thingsU.S. Navyled to exceptional cooperation from that branch of the military.That zeal however also unbalances the film turning it into something of an earnest two-hour infomercial that should do wonders for naval recruiting if not civilian entertainment. The invading aliens start off like gangbusters but they end up resembling the Washington Generals of yore fated to lose to the Harlem Globetrotters night after hopeless night.It takes a full half hour into this overly long film before those aliens hit the screen. Until then ""Battleship"" is under the illusion that its characters are completely fascinating and it takes its time introducing us to the dramatis personae.Front and center is Taylor Kitsch (best known for his role in Bergs TV hit ""Friday Night Lights"") playing Alex Hopper a stubborn and hot-headed young man whos made a habit of screwing up his life.While his straight-arrow brother Stone Hopper (Alexander SkarsgAY=rd) is making a career in the Navy Alex is doing things like breaking into a closed convenience store to procure a chicken burrito to impress a hot woman hes just met in a bar. Really.Said woman Sam Shane (Brooklyn Decker) just happens to be the daughter of Adm. Shane (the reliably gruff Liam Neeson) the man in charge of the entire Pacific fleet. Before you can say ""anchors aweigh"" Alex not only has joined the Navy but hes also somehow become a lieutenant whom Sam has agreed to marry with a catch Alex still a screwup has to get the admiral to agree to the match.While these dubious shenanigans are going on something called the Beacon Project is playing out in the background. NASA has been beaming a signal to the universe in an attempt to make contact with presumably friendly aliens. An outerspace race does get the signal and uses it to find its way to Earth but these aliens are anything but friendly.In fact these other-worldly types from Planet G leave no doubt as to their intentions by launching weapons that look like enormous fiery ball bearings intent on shredding everything in sight.Right in their line of fire are the Pearl Harbor-based Pacific fleet vessels that the Stone boys (as well as gunner Cora Raikes played in a pleasantly feisty debut by Rihanna) call home. Will an alien invasion that puts all of humanity at risk be enough to get Alex to finally stop screwing up? ""Battleship"" considers this an open question.Though they have impressive weapons and the resources to make the journey to Earth these humanoid aliens are as ungainly as the movie itself clunking around in awkward protective suits. Once revealed their prominent chin whiskers make them look like surly Amish farmers upset at a barn-raising gone wrong.Amish or not in a logical world these folks are so technologically superior that the Earth would be toast. But of course a way has to be found to give humanity a fighting chance a way that turns out to be fully in keeping with Bergs sentimentality about the Navy. Its all very earnest but its not a whole lot of fun.kenneth.turanlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESHungry Hungry Hippos Action Man Monopoly headed to big...October 4 2012Battleship is no match for The AvengersMay 21 2012Get set for a big landingApril 29 2012Hollywood bets heavily on razzle-dazzle action and effectsApril 27 2012Movie review Battle Los AngelesMarch 11 2011MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesEntertainmentBattleshipAlien InvasionCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-battleship-20120518,0,6752668.story?track=rss",200,battleship9,battleship,latimes
"Battleship directed by Peter Berg reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up There Is Not a Single Redeeming Plotline in Battleship There Is Not a Single Redeeming Plotline in Battleship Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 17 2012 626 PM Battleship Itll keelhaul you till youre sober. By Dana Stevens Battleship starring Taylor Kitsch Universal Pictures. After youve seen Battleship come back and listen to our spoiler special Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Battleship (Universal/Hasbro) must have prevailed in whatever war it was waging on me because three days after seeing it all I can remember is that its about battleships and is based on the board game Battleship and is about a lot of ships that ... battle. Battleship (directed by Peter Berg of The Kingdom and Friday Night Lights) is a dumb action blockbuster but not generously life-givingly dumb like the Mission Impossible movies or Roland Emmerichs 2012 (ahhh 2012). This is the kind of summer movie that softens your brain tissue without even providing the endocrine burst of pleasure that would make it all worthwhile. It even--please fine me for saying this--makes Michael Bays Transformers movies look rollicking by comparison. Given that it spends a good 85 percent of its 130-minute running time bludgeoning the viewers senses with explosions and CGI naval battles and hurtling alien vessels Battleship has a lot of nerve asking us to care about the hastily sketched human dramas unfolding on the periphery. You know how even in a terrible movie therell often be one subplot or performance that you find yourself looking forward to during the dull parts? This film offers no such respite. Every storyline from the neer-do-well Navy lieutenant who suddenly finds himself in charge of defending his ship from aliens to the physical therapist scaling a mountain with her double-amputee client is equally worthy of dread. Advertisement In the main plot Taylor Kitsch plays Alex Hopper a pouty trouble-prone bad boy whose upstanding older brother (Alexander Skarsgard) manages to man-shame him into joining the Navy on his 26th birthday. But as a sailor Alexs rebel ways continue and hes on the verge of getting kicked out of the Navy by his girlfriends father the daunting Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson sort of phoning in the dauntingness). First though Alex and his brother must take part in RIMPAC an international training exercise in which the navies of different countries meet to simulate battle scenarios at sea. But RIMPAC becomes WTFPAC when in the middle of the first day of exercises Alexs ship the John Paul Jones encounters an inexplicable looming monolith that turns out to be the base of operations for an invasion from outer space. Thus begins a long run of poorly differentiated scenes in which the John Paul Jones pluckily and perhaps unwisely takes on the alien megaships. Its all a blur but there were a lot of shots of people looking up slack-jawed at inconceivably large and powerful objects and saying things like ""Jesus God in Heaven."" In the B-plot Alexs girlfriend Sam (Brooklyn Decker) an exercise therapist tries to coax a disabled vet (Gregory D. Gadson a real-life Iraq vet who lost both legs above the knee) to join her on a hike up a Hawaiian mountain. As it turns out this is the mountain the aliens are trying to get to in order to use its SETI-style satellite base to send a message back home--one that will we may only assume boil down to ""Send more ships."" Will Sam and Mick make it to the satellite base in time to blow it up and save the world? Or will Alex and his comrades at sea get there first? What of poor Liam Neeson looking on impotently at both action plots while separated from them by an alien force field? Will Alexs derring-do in battle be enough to convince the admiral to grant his daughters hand in marriage? (That seriously is an important plot point in the story. In Battleship II the issue of Sams bride price will be hammered out.) Complaining about the acting in Battleship seems like misplaced aggression; its not the actors fault that the lines theyre speaking are so terrible. That said there are some performances in this movie that are not so much wooden as Styrofoam. Kitsch who showed promise as an action hero in the less-bad-than-it-could-have-been John Carter does what he can with the role Alex Hopper but his character arc basically consists of jutting his jaw out with steadily increasing stubbornness. The scenes with Decker and Gadson on the mountaintop alternate between frantic and placid as if they cant decide how much energy to invest in the impending destruction of Earth. Rihanna is more credible as a tough-as-nails petty officer on Alexs ship; at least unlike Sports Illustrated model Decker she isnt always filmed in Megan Fox-style soft focus in front of a wind machine. One of Battleships biggest mistakes was not to spend more time exploring its aliens culture and physiognomy. We only see two of the invaders up close for a few brief moments and never hear their speech or observe them aboard their own ship. There are signs throughout that the aliens observe some sort of moral code--they tend to target technology rather than living beings and at one point deliberately bypass a Little League game that lies in their path of destruction. Yet when its convenient for the jingoistic boo-yah energy of the story the aliens once again become faceless monsters whose obliteration we should cheer mindlessly. Id welcome a summer movie with morally ambiguous villains but these are just out-of-focus villains--it doesnt seem to have occurred to any of the writers that it would be more fun to hiss at the reptilian-eyed invaders if we knew what we were rooting against. I should take back the above claim that Battleship lacks any saving graces. There are at least two deliberately funny moments that hint at the existence of a zanily witty Airplane-style spoof buried in this movies turgid depths. In the first the commanders of the John Paul Jones come up with a computer program to track the movement of the underwater alien ships and the grid on their screen precisely echoes the look of the old Battleship board game--its as if in the midst of all this thunderous manliness Berg wants us to remember he knows its all a silly game. The second moment of wit occurs in the climactic battle sequence when our ragtag heroes leap aboard a decommissioned WWII ship thats been turned into a floating museum. For no reason thats ever explained a group of elderly veterans is standing by on the old ship (were they docents?) and the old salts proceed to help their juniors ready the ship for intergalactic warfare. As the concessions stand is triumphantly overturned ACDCs  ""Thunderstruck"" kicks in to accompany a sprightly fixer-upper montage. For those brief moments Battleship becomes something different a jaunty melange of Top Gun patriotism and Starship Troopers looniness. If a sequel is truly inevitable maybe Peter Berg can be encouraged to steer the ship in that direction. Correction May 17 2012 This article originally described Gregory D.

Mostly Battleship is a noisy overlong and numbing military-vs.-aliens saga with laughably bad dialogue.When it comes to alien-invasion movies the best in recent years is still the low-budget and gritty District 9. The alien ""prawns"" felt like real creatures. In this 200 million extravaganza we just get a glimpse of alien faces fringed by goatees made of what look like porcupine quills. There is little sense of individual alien abilities or powers. The film just feels like an exercise for the military to vanquish nasty invaders in the most overblown way possible.STORY Battleship plays to winMORE Battle to survive takes veteran to HollywoodVIDEO Rihanna makes big screen debut with BattleshipWhat does seem fresh are the joint efforts of the U.S. and Japanese forces off the coast of Hawaii as well as drawing on the heroism of multiple generations of veterans including Lt. Col. Mick Canales (decorated Iraq War vet Gregory D. Gadson) who accomplishes much despite having lost both legs. Several real-life former Navy men veterans of battles in World War II and Korea also have roles. Therein lies the films strong suit -- employing brave men across a wide age spectrum not usually seen in Hollywood combat sequences.One of only two women in the film pop diva Rihanna plays Petty Officer Cora Raikes and while she pulls off the general comportment of a soldier she should definitely keep her day job.About the movieBattleship out of fourStarsTaylor Kitsch Alexander Skarsgard Liam Neeson Brooklyn Decker Gregory D. GadsonDirectorPeter BergDistributor Universal PicturesRating PG-13 for intense sequences of violence action and destruction and for languageRunning time 2 hours 10 minutesOpens Friday nationwide Taylor Kitsch last seen in John Carter plays Alex Hopper a troublemaker turned naval officer and brother of Stone Hopper the commanding officer played by Alexander Skarsgard. Brooklyn Decker is Sam Shane Alexs fiancee. The two meet in a bar on Alexs 26th birthday and he proves his ardor when he breaks into a nearby convenience store to get her a chicken burrito. Thats love no doubt.Both Hoppers are on the fleet of Navy ships primed for military games which suddenly face an alien armada firing down on them. A life-and-death contest ensues between plucky humans and nasty extraterrestrials.Watch eight clips from the film BattleshipLiam Neeson plays Adm. Shane an imposing Navy officer and Sams father. Initially he dismisses Alex as a screw-up. But by the end of the protracted saga a wedding looks imminent. Even the most curmudgeonly future father-in-law lightens up a bit when the guy who proposes to his daughter also saves the world.Battleship works better as a disaster film than as sci-fi thriller. It never seems remotely likely that the aliens will take control of Earth. Still the cataclysmic mess they make is appropriately astounding.Forgettable characters spouting cliches undercut director Peter Bergs computer-generated visual achievements. Though he created TVs wonderfully nuanced Friday Night Lights Berg seems to have lately studied at the Michael Bay school of thundering soulless filmmaking.

By Rex Reed  05/16/12 545pm In the dementedly overproduced and underwhelming action epic Battleship what promises to be another brainless summer of so-called ""blockbusters"" takes another giant step backward. The wags already labeling this one ""Terminator with water"" are on the mark--I have to admit it has moments of noisy glory I couldnt ignore. As another cookie-cutter ripoff inspired by comic books and video games (this time Hasbros naval-combat pencil and paper-cum-board-turned-video game) youre better here than with the idiotic Marvels The Avengers. To paraphrase a lyric from Guys and Dolls by the great Frank Loesser ""More than that I cannot wish you."" Skipping through a mass of sci-fi prologue mumbo-jumbo NASAs transmission device which is more powerful than anything known to science has discovered another planet with the same water air and climate as Earth. Its called Planet G and suddenly faster than a rocket launch it has declared war wiping out Hong Kong and heading for Hawaii. In Oahu where 20000 Navy men have assembled for the biggest game competition since the invention of the pinball machine the spaceship strikes attacking Pearl Harbor recalling the Japanese air strike that once stun-gunned Franklin D. Roosevelt into military history. This time the harbor where the U.S.S. Missouri stands as a World War II museum becomes the launch pad for war at sea with ... aliens? Taylor Kitsch the camera-ready hunk from the Nautilus School of Dramatic Art who just survived the billion-dollar bomb John Carter plays Lieutenant Alex Hopper a screw-up of a weapons officer with no experience who takes over the state-of-the-art battleship John Paul Jones when the state-of-the-art U.S.S. Sampson commanded by his veteran big brother Stone (Alexander Skarsgard) is blown to scrap metal by the vastly superior vessels from outer space. Alex is in love with a beautiful physical therapist for disabled combat veterans named Sam (Brooklyn Decker) who is also the daughter of the Commander of the Pacific Fleet (played by Liam Neeson in a cameo of sorts). The admiral thinks Alex has a weak character and poor leadership and even worse decision-making skills and is on the verge of kicking him out of the Navy. To make matters worse Alex faces a powerful adversary in Captain Yugi Nagata (Tadanobu Asano) commanding officer of the Japanese destroyer Myoko. Poor Alex has got a lot to prove with the help of an Army battalion leader and double amputee played by Col. Gregory D. Gadson a real-life veteran who lost both legs in Iraq in 2007 various boatswains engine-room experts and pop star Rihanna making her screen debut as a sarcastic crewmate and weapons specialist who changes her tune in battle (but fortunately does not sing). If you got all that straight youre a better man than I Gunga Din. But back to the aliens. Destroying Marine bases helicopters jet planes warships on the sea and radar transmitters in the sky they must wonder as much as I do in the middle of an ozone-destroying nuclear war how Alexs girlfriend reaches him from a mountain top on her cell phone. It makes no sense why the John Paul Jones is the only destroyer in the Pacific Ocean to battle the alien invasion. ""Lets see if we can buy the world one more day"" says one sailor. ""Who talks like that?"" is the reply. And then when theyre blown into ocean foam the only humans left to come to their rescue are the old World War II survivors on the 70-year-old floating museum the U.S.S. Missouri. Even NASA is rendered helpless but when it comes to Pearl Harbor this movie asks you to save the patriotic applause for the old tugs. Never mind. Its not the wooden acting asinine plot or feebleminded dialogue that keep you awake. Its the attacking UFOs sending out grinding wheels of fire that look like Good Year tire rims equipped with atomic bombs. Will the old salts called into action one last time to fire on the alien missiles with torpedoes from the 1940s raise Earths flag in triumph? Battleship is dopey preposterous and unintentionally hilarious in all the wrong places but as directed by Peter Berg it is also energetic fast-moving and bracing. Summer audiences with a high tolerance for stupidity and low expectations will jerk and shake and wince in perfect unison with the cacophonous soundtrack. For artistry look elsewhere but for inescapable time-wasting entertainment value search no further than Battleship. rreedobserver.com BATTLESHIP Running Time 131 minutes Written by Erich Hoeber and Jon Hoeber Directed by Peter Berg Starring Alexander Skarsgard Brooklyn Decker and Liam Neeson Comment Filed under battleship movie Rihanna Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics The Man Who Made Blue Oyster Cult RIP Producer Sandy Pearlman Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://observer.com/2012/05/16/you-sunk-my-blockbuster-battleships-bombs-away-mentality-stays-bouyant/,200,battleship12,battleship,com/2012/05/16/you-sunk-my-blockbuster-battleships-bombs-away-mentality-stays-bouyant/

Universal Studios By Joe Morgenstern May 17 2012 544 p.m. ET There comes a time in ""Battleship"" a board game gone megabudget-ballistic when the fate of our planet has seemingly been sealed by an attack from outer space. ""Were looking at an extinction-level event"" an astronomer declares and its hard to disagree what with the invaders stupendously powerful vessels and the impenetrable force fields that protect them. Around this time you may feel youre looking at another extinction-level event one that threatens the end of logic storytelling characterization hearing and maybe even the movie business as we know it. Still the planet is saved by a U.S. Navy lieutenant backed up by the Pacific fleet while the movie is enlivened now and then by lines that rise above intentional stupidity into inspired idiocy and by occasionally stunning imagery that cuts through the computer-generated clutter. The classic board game ""Battleship"" has been turned into a high-energy action flick starring Taylor Kitsch Alexander Skarsgard Rihanna Brooklyn Decker and Liam Neeson. Watch a clip from the film. Cideo Universal. The Earths savior Lt. Alex Hopper is played by Taylor Kitsch; he helped save Mars as John Carter in the recent misfortune of the same name. As a gifted young man whos made a mess of his life Alex is long overdue for redemption. When opportunity knocks however--hes suddenly asked to command the only ship inside the invaders force field--he first says ""I cant"" and thereby triggers a choice idiocy from a shipmate who responds plaintively ""If you cant who can?"" Like ""Transformers"" which it rivals in relentlessness ""Battleship"" comes with its own force field a furious energy that renders criticism irrelevant. Its still worth noting that something odd is going on in the sketchy story. One example involves an early sequence and an entertaining one about Alexs efforts to fetch a burrito for a beautiful woman who turns out to be the admirals daughter. (Shes played with flawless plasticity by Brooklyn Decker.) Next thing we know a few minutes later Alex is nervously preparing to ask the admiral (Liam Neeson) to approve their marriage. Conventional notions of development and continuity have been replaced by a narrative technique best likened to sampling discrete events along a timeline. Is that intentional? Surely not. Movies like this one directed by Peter Berg from a ragtag script by Erich Hoeber and Jon Hoeber are such huge industrial enterprises that no one can keep track of all the pieces. And will the core audience care or even notice? Probably not; nuance isnt the main attraction. But the same disjointed approach applies to the production design where serious short-changing takes place. ""Battleship"" contains some beautiful effects the devastation of Hong Kong the raising of the force fields and most notably the form and function of the alien vessels which suggest deranged Olympians doing the breast stroke. Yet those effects are sampled too in slices too thin to give sustenance. Polisse The film ""Polisse"" follows members of the child-protection unit of the Paris police force as they investigate cases of sexual deviancy. Watch a clip from the film. Video Sundance Selects. In police shows on TV the cops are stressed but essentially in control as they deal with perps and victims. The cops in ""Polisse"" members of a child-protection unit within the Paris police force can barely maintain their sanity let alone their equanimity. They live like a dysfunctional family while dealing with cases of sexual deviancy breathtaking ignorance or amorality plus the turbulence of their own sex lives. This astonishing French feature directed by Maiwenn from a script she wrote with Emmanuelle Bercot is based on cases from real life. Following the mosaic convention of TV procedurals it leaps from one crisis to another with an attention-deficit alacrity that occasionally borders on absurdity. But what makes it such a singular experience is the convergence of fine acting moral urgency and a willingness to linger on moments of great intensity. In one of them a smug Muslim man accused of child abuse is confronted by a female Muslim cop. The man insists theres nothing wrong with his pushing his underage daughter into an arranged marriage with her cousin back home. The cop responding with frustration and rage waves a copy of the Quran in his face. ""If youre a man and a good Muslim"" she shouts ""just tell me where it says a father can force his daughter to marry."" In another marvelous moment a cop named Fred holds a weeping boy in his arms and tries to console him. Of the many cases the child-protection people have been struggling with this one constitutes their most flagrant failure for they cant find a homeless shelter in all of Paris that will accept the boy together with his helpless mother. Fred embodies the movies moral and dramatic center. A passionately dedicated public servant though also a volatile and violent one hes played by the French rapper Joeystarr a burly figure whose tenderness put me in mind of Wallace Beery. Other cops include Karin Viards equally volatile Nadine Marina Foiss tortured Iris and the units morally malleable commander Beauchard (Wladimir Yordanoff). Maiwenn--who was born Maiwenn Le Besco--plays Melissa a photographer assigned to document the units activities. Like everyone else in the cast shes an excellent actor with a great director. The Dictator Comedian Sacha Baron Cohen takes on his newest persona of Admiral General Shabazz Aladeen in the movie ""The Dictator."" Watch a clip from the film. Video Paramount Pictures. Sacha Baron Cohens gleefully scabrous portrait of a fictional North African tyrant called Admiral General Aladeen starts high with a tribute to the memory of Kim Jong Il and tosses off some sensationally funny stuff before descending into a rat-a-tat rhythm of random insult and ritual vulgarity. Its a letdown and a loss. We can always use craziness on the level of Aladeen winning 14 gold medals in his own Olympic games by shooting other athletes. Theres even satirical value in the ghastliness of his asking a pregnant woman whether shes having a boy or an abortion. Vulgarity on the other hand is in ample supply; its merely dismaying to watch the bearded dictator dump his own urine on an Israeli ambassador while delivering a speech at the United Nations. In the 2006 mockumentary ""Borat"" Mr. Baron Cohen gave us a hero of triumphant imbecility played with the lechery of Groucho Marx and the taut anxiety of Alan Arkin. Three years later in ""Bruno"" he was less entertaining and sometimes downright embarrassing as a blond flamboyantly gay fashion journalist in lederhosen and Spandex. Last year in ""Hugo"" his formidable gifts as a performer were thwarted by clumsy direction and a conspicuous absence of fresh material. Now hes turning material both fresh and rancid into tepid gruel. In one scene an androgynous ultra-liberal at a health-food co-op teaches Aladeen to masturbate. Shes played charmingly by an all-but-unrecognizable Anna Faris and his reaction is blithely amusing ""Wait what sorcery is this?"" On the whole though ""The Dictator"" is much more masturbatory than ensorcelling.

Now catch the movie. OK I get that. Comic books are practically storyboards. Natural transition. Seen the TV show? Now catch the movie. Even better.

Played the board game? Now catch the movie. Ummmm ... Im thinking here. No characters no plot no natural tension. In the classic board game Battleship what happens is basically just that you blow up batt.... Oh OK. Got it. So what else to say about Battleship the movie. Well it has aliens for one thing. Weve unwittingly beckoned them from afar and theyve arrived without their communications equipment (it was knocked off-course in a fender bender with a satellite) which has made them cranky. Mayhem ensues looking mostly like Transformers on boats. As an action director Peter Bergs no Michael Bay but he gave Hancock energy enough to get by and put plenty of character into the original movie version of Friday Night Lights. Give him that. Here hes working with Taylor Kitsch the lovably irresponsible lush Tim Riggins from FNLs TV spinoff whos playing lovably irresponsible lush Alex Hopper here with much the same attitude and at least initially the same hair. Also scientist Hamish Linklater (geekily funny) Adm.

Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Universal Pictures Hopper and Raikes attempt to decipher a strange reading that precedes the alien attack. Universal Pictures The story by brothers Erich and Jon Hoeber who also penned the clever quippy aging-assassin movie Red is cleverer and quippier than it has any reason to be even if it makes not the remotest sense. The screenwriters have to tie themselves in knots to get to a scene that actually echoes the board game where both sides must try to blast stationary targets they cant see. And once they have the outcome is more or less incoherent. That said a lot of stuff blows up about as persuasively as it would in a better movie. An after-the-credits sequence promises a sequel to come a development that would seem less alarming frankly if trade papers werent reporting that Hasbros deal-makers have been busy of late. Ridley Scott has screenwriters working on a movie of Monopoly and Candylands been acquired for Adam Sandler. Chutes and Ladders anyone?

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> No wonder the cast gives up on acting. Its not that screenwriting brothers Erich and Jon Hoeber (Red) dont put words in their mouths. The problem is they do. ""Ive got a bad feeling about this"" says Alex Hooper (Taylor Kitsch) a Navy lieutenant stationed in Oahu Hawaii who gets caught up in an alien invasion at sea. Alex is a screw-up. Hes dating Sam (Brooklyn Decker) the hottie daughter of the admiral (Liam Neeson) who hates him. And he knows his captain brother Stone (Alexander Skarsgard) is a way-better hardass. So while Sam stays on land with paraplegic Army veteran Mick (real-life Iraq hero Gregory D. Gadson) to make sure these E.T.s dont phone home Alex and his weapons specialist (Rihanna of all people) take aim at the muthafuckers. Actually its just ""muthas"" thanks to a PG-13 rating. Berg panders shamelessly for the big finish enlisting the real WWII battleship USS Missouri and its old-school crew. Way to go Battleship Take the crassest of cynical junk slather it in jingoism and sell it as rah-rah fun for right-wingers.

Its funny -- somehow in all the time weve been getting our classic-games fix playing Battleship we missed the part where youll call out say B-5 and suddenly find a giant techno-morphing alien spacecraft on the grid. But hey if youre Hasbro and Universal and youve agreed to make a movie based on nothing more than brand recognition of a game youve got to fill two hours with something.So why not go the ""Transformers"" route? After all Hasbros corporate dreams of duplicating its success with that unabashedly toyetic franchise are precisely what led to ""Battleship"" -- along with a widely mocked Universal slate reportedly now scrapped that was to have included ""Monopoly"" ""Ouija"" and ""Candy Land."" (Didnt Katy Perry and Snoop Dogg cover that last one already?)Directed by Peter Berg ""Battleship"" stars Taylor Kitsch (""John Carter"" poor guy) as Hopper a hunky neer-do-well hanging loose in Hawaii with his naval officer older brother (Alexander Skarsgard ""True Blood""). A brisk promising opener alternates Hoppers comically bungled flirtation with Sam (swimsuit model-turned-tank-top actress Brooklyn Decker) and tech-y glimpses at an initiative to establish deep space contact with a newly discovered planet. ""If they come here its gonna be like Columbus and the Indians"" grumbles one science wonk. ""Only were the Indians.""Sure enough Hopper lands in trouble -- Sam while charmed is the daughter of an admiral (an uninvested Liam Neeson) -- and gets an ultimatum from his brother to sign up for duty. The aliens promptly show in an armada that lands off Oahu just in time to mix it up with the USS John Paul Jones and other real fleet vessels.Cut to some mildly interesting shot-across-the-bow stuff mashing up sci-fi first contact iconography and old Navy movies. Its soon established that the new arrivals are bent on seizing communications and telling more invaders to come on down. (Their own communications rig broke away in the atmosphere and catastrophically smashed downtown Hong Kong.) Then the fireworks start.If only there were more genuine rah-rah fun involved instead of just endless thudding seen-it-all-before mayhem. The filmmakers avoid the occasional visual incoherence of ""Transformers"" but deliver only a couple of bits of kid-pleasing spectacle and nominal stabs at referencing the board game. On the acting side such as it is you watch pop star Rihanna glowering nonstop in her feature debut as one of Hoppers crewmates and you wonder Is she having a good time?Despite this projects seemingly cynical genesis Bergs unlikely involvement raised expectations. The onetime ""Chicago Hope"" doc has done some assured work since shifting his focus to directing including the feature version of ""Friday Night Lights"" and the kinetic feds-in-Saudi Arabia procedural ""The Kingdom."" But here the storytelling is relentlessly generic save for some clever light touches with Kitsch at the start and some screwy opportunities for real-life US military vets to get in the action at the finish.One of these final flourishes is spoiler material but the other involves Deckers intercut mission back on land helping a disabled embittered soldier (double amputee Gregory D. Gadson) to take heart and take on ""Halo""-suited alien ground forces. Gadsons acting is hardly polished but he leaves an impression which is more than the movie generally manages.

Credit ILM/Universal Pictures You would think that after intercepting broadcasts of science-fiction movies for decades extraterrestrials would know that if they want to conquer us Earthlings they need to take out our lovably rebellious rogues and our unexpectedly heroic nerds. Photo Taylor Kitsch in ""Battleship."" Credit Frank Masi/Universal Pictures Certainly the makers of ""Battleship"" a cacophonous new special-effects extravaganza inspired (sort of) by a game youngsters once played with pencils and graph paper have studied those old movies. You can tell because they seem to have borrowed rather a lot from them.""Battleship"" the latest filmmaking project of the Hasbro toy company has a plot as unambitious as a macaroni dinner familiar and easy to eat and not particularly nutritious. It is likely to remind you variously of ""Independence Day"" ""Armageddon"" ""War of the Worlds"" and assorted other space-based yarns. Which of course means theres never much doubt about how it will end. Photo Rihanna in ""Battleship."" Credit Universal Pictures The United States Navy is conducting training exercises along with allies off Hawaii when unfriendly visitors come calling in gigantic spacecraft that land in the ocean. The naval weaponry seems hopelessly inadequate to the task of defending against the invaders. But hallelujah a rule-breaking junior officer (Taylor Kitsch) and an admirals daughter (Brooklyn Decker) and several other makeshift heroes have greatness thrust upon them and eventually find ways to overcome the seemingly invincible. Even Rihanna playing a petty officer who handles the big guns helps out (and shes just fine in the rather generic role).No one who goes to this movie directed by Peter Berg is likely to care about the lack of finesse in the script and the acting but a little bit more effort in either area would have made this a much better film. Most of the roles seem underplayed. Heck if youre going to build your story around that rogue cliche your main guy needs to be pretty roguish. Mr. Kitsch is too bland to be memorable a description that also applies to Liam Neeson as the not-crusty-enough admiral and most of the secondary members of the world-saving crew. They include Jesse Plemons who was so appealing in ""Friday Night Lights"" on TV but here comes across as annoying. Video This Weeks Movies | May 18 2012 The New York Times film critics on ""What to Expect When Youre Expecting"" ""The Color Wheel"" and ""Battleship."" By Rob Harris on Publish Date May 17 2012. . Watch in Times Video >> embed If borrowed plots and lazily constructed characters werent enough the film also indulges in shameless button-pushing with greatest-generation homages and shout-outs to injured veterans of more recent wars. It all builds to a plot twist near the end that is improbable even for a science-fiction tale. If you find this absurd turn of events stirring then this movie is for you. But you might instead end up giggling which does not appear to be what the filmmakers were going for.What does any of this have to do with the game Battleship? You remember Battleship the sink-or-be-sunk contest involving ships on a grid played at first on paper then as a board game and more recently on video screens. For most of its length this film bears no resemblance to the game but eventually a moderately ingenious way is found for the fight against the aliens to at least suggest the old you-sunk-my-battleship war of wits. Its a nice touch in a movie that doesnt have many of them but will make millions of dollars anyway.""Battleship"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Because even against space aliens war is hell.

Artificial slope to open at Buck Hill this fall next Movies 151895925 Battleship goes bust on the high seas Noisy effects cant hide a soggy plot and a boneheaded hero.  |  out of 4 stars By COLIN COVERT May 17 2012 -- 401pm Video (4332)  Summer movie blockbusters are making their way to theaters and Battleship is one with a lot of bang and not a lot of brains. Shari L. Gross Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Battleship"" is all wet. The film boasts a destroyers wallop of visual effects but not enough brains to fill a dinghy. Its cliches-in-a-blender plot and clunker dialogue will disappoint anyone who hoped that basing a movie on a brand-name board game was a guarantee of quality. Slavishly imitative of action hack Michael Bays cinema du boom the story is essentially a moist ""Transformers."" Responding to a beacon signal from Earth extraterrestrial invaders send of all things a fleet. The ships look like big angry metal water bugs and propel themselves by jumping a few hundred feet at a time. You may wonder why an intelligence that could manage an interstellar space expedition would choose to travel in such a slow inconvenient and bumpy manner once they arrive. Dont. Looking at ""Battleship"" through the prism of logic will only induce migraines. These aliens can quarantine the Hawaiian islands behind a force field that flattens jet fighters like June bugs but do not outfit their command ship with bulletproof glass. They engage in combat by firing explosive projectiles that are no more accurate than pirate cannonballs. This is a big step back for aliens. Even in the flying-saucer movies of old they had an air force and death rays. The invaders arrive off the coast of Oahu during a multinational naval exercise. Taylor Kitsch (fresh off the epic flop ""John Carter"") tops the cast as Lt. Alex Hopper a wastrel who has been only partly redeemed by Navy discipline. Hopper may be the most boneheaded action hero in movie history. When an alien skyscraper pops up in the azure waters he decides to form a one-man boarding party pounding on the dormant towers exterior and making the sleeping giant wake up grumpy. After the invaders sink two destroyers amid explosions fireballs and bodies flying through the air he declares ""Ive got a bad feeling about this."" Roger that. The film is mostly about muscular macho guys in uniform (the main civilian is a weedy science dweeb Hamish Linklater whos cowardly and cant drive a car). In an effort to provide balance there are a couple of hot chicks. Swimwear model Brooklyn Decker whose name sounds like a deli sandwich plays Kitschs love interest Sam. She is the daughter of Adm. Liam Neeson. He must not have raised her well She gives Kitsch her heart when they meet in a bar and he breaks into a convenience store to steal her a chicken burrito. Also on hand is pop star Rihanna who plays a spunky gunner; apparently Michelle Rodriguez was taking the week off. There are also -- spoiler alert -- some crusty old seamen whose know-how comes in handy as they fire up the museum ship U.S.S. Missouri and miraculously locate 70-year-old ordnance for its big guns. Somehow I found the alien invasion part easier to believe. Universal Pictures Taylor Kitsch squares off against an alien invader in ""Battleship."" The hoo-rah for vets extends to the best part of the film the performance by Lt. Col. Gregory Gadson director of the U.S. Armys Wounded Warrior Program. He plays a double-amputee Iraq hero whose prosthetic legs are perfect for kicking alien butt. With lines like ""Lets see if we can give the Earth one more day"" his role is a hazardous mission but danged if Gadson doesnt nail it. You probably wont remember the interchangeable action sequences the next day but this guy will stay with you.

But the game Clue comes with characters and a plot and a house. Battleship comes with a grid and boats and pegs. All those things turn up in ""Battleship"" a big loud stupid Hollywood movie that winds up looking all the better by virtue of not being as elephantine and deafening and moronic as a Michael Bay ""Transformers"" adventure. Peter Berg and writers Erich and John Hoeber arent interested in nuance or character or wit but they imbue the movie with enough adrenaline and forward momentum that I was never bored. And that sadly makes it better than most of the other expensive and over-hyped films of its ilk. Taylor Kitsch does his damnedest to channel Tom Cruises Maverick character from ""Top Gun"" -- the ""John Carter"" star plays Alex Hopper a troublemaker who nonetheless has lots of potential. (We know this because every three minutes or so someone yells ""You have so much potential"" at him.) The younger brother of distinguished naval officer Stone Hopper (Alexander Skarsgard whose first line of dialogue betrays his Scandinavian accent) and boyfriend of Sam (Brooklyn Decker) the nubile daughter of Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson) Alex nonetheless finds himself on the verge of getting kicked out of the Navy. But then the aliens come. Drawn to Earth by a high-powered signal sent to them -- scientists are stupid the movie seems to be saying -- five vessels arrive creating an impenetrable dome that covers both Hawaii (where the alien-contacting satellite dishes are located) and a naval exercise where U.S. ships are engaging in mock combat with fleets from various Asian countries. Firing a series of peg-like missiles the aliens take out several ships and Alex finds himself having to command his own vessel. Can he get along with his Japanese rival long enough to defeat the lizardy humanoid E.T.s? Can Sam and her physical therapy patient and a techno-nerd (Hamish Linklater) stop the first wave of aliens from contacting their brethren? You can probably guess. What you might not foresee is that Rihanna playing a weapons expert doesnt embarrass herself as an actress; she neither hits the heights of Mariah Carey in ""Precious"" nor the depths of Carey in ""Glitter"" but her work is perfectly serviceable. It also wont surprise that the script is full of holes -- the aliens knock out radio and the internet in Hawaii but Alexs ship can still summon a grid of buoys on the computer? -- or that the movie is loaded with shameless product placement for brands of soda and fast food that will not be mentioned here. The studios seem hell-bent on making Kitsch happen as a leading man but once again hes adequate at best. At times his performance seems so blurry as to merely be a conduit through which teen boys can imagine themselves saving the day in his place. (Join the Navy the movie seems to be saying. A lot.) Nonetheless this thing lasts 131 minutes but almost never drags and theres something to be said for keeping this much baloney aloft for that long. Like the bulky and unwieldy vessel for which its named ""Battleship"" is both indefensible and unassailable. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Photo Credit Universal Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Aliens attack Earth but first theyll have to get past the U.S. Navy. BOTTOM LINE A crass hollow hoo-rah fantasy best suited for 9-year-olds with weaponry fixations. CAST Taylor Kitsch Brooklyn Decker Liam Neeson Rihanna. LENGTH 221 Empty pro-military propaganda? Hit A production budget larger than a presidential campaign? Hit Brooklyn Decker spilling out of her top? You sunk my battleship Steaming toward multiplex domination the sci-fi juggernaut ""Battleship"" employs the same nonintelligent strategy as the Hasbro board game Fire blindly at broad targets and wait for explosions. It quotes audaciously from Sun Tzus ""The Art of War"" but this hollow hoorah fantasy will appeal mainly to 9-year-old boys dazzled by weaponry and uniforms. Theyre also the viewers least likely to notice what a creaky shoddily constructed vessel ""Battleship"" really is. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless Comedy Central upset over use of fake Colbert? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Messing Shelton call truce after spat over Trump Matt Damon says hes taking a year-long acting break Older audiences will recognize the officers gentlemen and top guns in this rip-off script which involves cocky Lieutenant Alex (Taylor Kitsch); his officer brother Stone (Alexander Skarsgard); and flinty-eyed Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson). Endless lectures about wasted talent are thankfully cut short by an alien invasion in the waters around Hawaii. These are humanoid aliens with rubbery digits and rockabilly goatees (and protective suits that may infringe on patents by Tony Stark). Its unclear why their ships are sometimes invincible and sometimes as flammable as balsa-wood gliders but the movie doesnt care. These nameless beings are just cannon fodder for American soldiers especially hotshot Alex who can drive a World War II-era warship around like an S-class Mercedes. Director Peter Berg (""Hancock"") handles the thunderous effects sequences well enough -- the bladed iron-eating spheres are pretty nifty -- but anything human-related lands dead in the water. The deep-bowing Captain Nagata (Tadanobu Asano) provides some East-West malarkey; Alexs girlfriend (Decker) mainly frets and jiggles on the sidelines; Rihanna as a tough-talking shipmate does little to justify her top billing. VideoTrailer Battleship The casting of real-life Iraq veteran Gregory D. Gadson as legless hero Mick Canales feels crassly manipulative especially in a movie whose childlike idea of war is lobbing missiles at coordinates on a high-tech grid.

Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff BOTTOM LINE A crass hollow hoo-rah fantasy best suited for 9-year-olds with weaponry fixations. Back story Battleship couldnt be too gung-ho Eager to showcase its ships in front of the taxpayers who pay for them the United States Navy cooperated enthusiastically with the makers of ""Battleship"" providing access to five destroyers and hundreds of real sailors. But with that access came a quandary for director Peter Berg how to shoot a movie starring Americas seaborne military branch without being too American for the foreign filmgoers who typically constitute more than half of an action movies audience. ""I did not want Battleship to be perceived as an American war film"" said Berg. ""I wanted to do everything I could to make the film accessible to a global audience. It felt like bringing an alien component to the film would help take the American jingoism out of it and let it be something that felt more summerish and more adventurous."" VideoRihannas movie role Berg 50 has spent a good chunk of his life around the military first as the son of a Marine who was an avid Naval historian then while embedded with Navy SEALs in Iraq to research a film. advertisement | advertise on newsday Bergs background positioned him well to walk the line between portraying the Navy authentically and pleasing Universal Pictures the studio that financed the 211-million action film with an eye toward building a franchise. -- Los Angeles Times Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

( ) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday May 17 2012 1235 PM Title Battleship Film Info With Taylor Kitsch Liam Neeson Rihanna Brooklyn Decker. The U.S. Navy deals with an alien invasion. Director Peter Berg. (211) PG-13 Violence. Area theaters. ""Battleship"" is the worst humans-fighting-aliens movie Ive ever seen. And Ive seen a lot of humans-fighting-aliens movies. Perhaps we should have been prepared for this cosmic joke of an action-adventure as its based on the classic Hasbro board game -- an absurdity its filmmakers have embraced with good humor but not hit with good aim. While the game itself accounts for maybe 2% of the content (there are battleships and at one point theres a grid that must be analyzed) its spirit is entirely intact This movie is impersonal plastic and has lots of easy-to-misplace pieces. Taylor Kitsch is Hopper a miscreant with a heart of gold introduced in a beer commercial-type bar being urged to shape up by his Navy officer brother (Alexander Skarsgard) and lusting after the daughter (Brooklyn Decker) of the admiral (Liam Neeson). Some time later hes in the Navy hoping to marry the admirals daughter before shipping out for some inter-naval games that bring several thousand sailors off the coast of Hawaii. RELATED PETER BERG BRINGS BOARD GAME TO BIG SCREEN Thats handy because soon wouldnt you know it aliens show up. They were hinted at in an early sequence when bearded geeks worry about a signal sent off that invites other life forms to come and say hi. Turns out the ones who RSVP set up an invisible wall around ships in the water then dont react well when theyre fired upon. The angry E.T.s send whirling buzzsaw-type objects which look like giant socket screws to cut through cities and their spacecraft which had plunged right into the ocean for some undisclosed reason pop up and try to sink our battleships. Some aliens do end up on land where one gets into a wrestling match with a double-amputee veteran. Taylor Kitsch and Rihanna ponder the aliens moves in ""Battleship."" ( ) These not-scary plan-less humanoid aliens seen with their helmets off for a maximum of perhaps five minutes look like Mickey Rourke with a goatee made of glass suggesting some effects designer fell asleep on the job. Theres some TV chatter overheard about a ""worldwide invasion"" but that little plotline seems undeveloped. Also wasted is Rihanna in her movie debut as a member of Hoppers crew. Couldnt someone have devised a scene where musics slinkiest star dances for even a moment? She simply makes stern faces as she presses buttons -- which puts her pretty much on par with Kitsch also the star of ""John Carter"" and a guy having a not-very-good year. Neeson for his part is back to coasting through big-budget wastes of time after a brief uptick with ""The Grey."" Director Peter Berg (""Friday Night Lights"" ""Hancock"") cant really be blamed since someone had to steer this thing out of port and it seems like the map was laid out according to the ""Transformers"" model. (Fans of ""Independence Day"" and ""The Abyss"" shouldnt get their hopes up for anything equivalent here.) ""Battleship"" is too clunky and thudding to stay afloat for even the first third of its overlong running time though the only ones wholl really get soaked are ticket buyers.

Peter Bergs Battleship may be based on a board game but it ultimately defies anything youre expecting -- in the very best way By Steven James Snyder thesnydesMay 17 2012 Share Read Later Universal Pictures / AP Taylor Kitsch left and Rihanna Battleship Year 2012 Director Peter Berg Studio Universal Pictures Actors Taylor Kitsch Alexander Skarsgard Rihanna Brooklyn Decker Liam Neeson RelatedMovie Review Battleship http//www.ew.com/ew/article/02058767400.htmlBattleship stays afloat in a sea of noise The Seattle Times Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Based on a board game that became popular precisely for its prosaic binary nature (hit/miss) one would expect a feature-length Battleship to be a decidedly one-note affair. But a funny thing happened on the way to mediocrity The creative team behind this ocean-bound thriller decided to fill the narrative black hole with a few ingredients all but absent from todays summer tent poles -- namely mystery nostalgia and a healthy dose of humility. Just as blockbusters have made the hard turn towards fantasy heroes who solemnly go about their business in high-def-but-low-impact 3D cage matches Battleship is an unapologetically goofy surprisingly enigmatic refreshingly self-deprecating deviation from the norm. I hesitate to confess that I had more fun here than I did at The Avengers because low expectations surely had a lot to do with it but its the truth. Heck Id pay to see the thing again. Director Peter Berg has apparently conceived of his production design as homage to (and improvement on) the works of Michael Bay -- from Battleships militaristic grandstanding to its absurd romance endlessly spinning action set pieces and deafening metal-on-metal sound effects. Right up top ahead of the credits Berg pulls a Bay in sprinting through the character introductions Youve got your lovable Hawaiian slacker Alex (Taylor Kitsch Friday Night Lights) who cant keep a job or get up the nerve to talk to the father of his girlfriend Sam (Brooklyn Decker). Shes a physical therapist on Oahu working with wounded Navy veterans who are coping with life after amputations (her newest patient is real-life veteran and amputee Gregory D. Gadson). Complicating matters is her dad Liam Neeson admiral of the fleet. Alex you see was brought into the Navy by his straight-laced brother Stone (Alexander Skarsgard) who thought a life of rank and discipline would benefit his younger half. And sure enough maturity comes quickly for the bumbling bro when on a joint Japan-U.S. naval exercise four mysterious objects crash through Earths atmosphere and into the Pacific. Anyone who has encountered the films relentless marketing blitz knows the basic outlines of what comes next Aliens terrorize Earth explosions dot the horizon and our sailors must prevent this ""extinction-level event."" (MORE The 10 Greatest Movies of the Millennium--Thus Far) ...Only thats not really how things play out at all. At every turn the aesthetics and attitude of Battleship jolt us out of our comfort zone. Alex should be a plodding predictable protagonist a Shia LaBeouf replicant alternating between fear and vengeance. But so much of the plot hinges instead on Alexs immaturity his decided lack of experience and his gradual growth into a man who can lead his peers (including Rihanna who plays a tough-as-nails naval gunner) through a crisis. One would expect the arrival of the aliens to usher in a mindless volley of lasers and torpedoes. But while there are plenty of shots fired and explosions to ogle far more intriguing than the firepower is the mystery that shrouds the weaponry. In the first tense standoff theres a surprising level of studying and calculation at play as the human first responders grapple to comprehend just what it is that theyve found floating out in the middle of the ocean. Even after the aliens show their true colors and things turn hostile the sailors -- as well as the audience -- begin to diagnose the weaknesses in the superior technology targeting them. Unlike most action heroes who simply possess expert skills Alex is learning as he goes and we learn through his eyes. As his crew develops a new attack plan for the final climactic brawl theres something slightly more fulfilling about a strategy thats evolved throughout the film. If the alien introduction is more cryptic than we expect the subplot playing out back on land is more inspiring. When the aliens track down the satellite array that initially brought them to Earth they start to set up a base in rural Oahu and thats when Sam and Gadson join forces with a nerdy satellite operator (Hamish Linklater) to single-handedly take the array off line. A scientist physical therapist and amputee taking out our E.T. invaders -- one of cinemas more unlikely motley crews. As for the board game its integrated into the film in surprisingly subtle ways (no one ever utters ""you sunk my battleship""). Once the aliens use a force field of sorts to separate three Navy vessels from the remainder of the fleet we start to get closer to the actual scope of a Battleship board. And if you look and listen closely youll recognize the cues A destroyer they say can dish it out but cant last as long as a battleship -- which as any player knows can withstands two or three direct hits but never four. When the radar goes down the Japanese sailors teach their American counterparts a trick of the trade using tsunami buoys to monitor displaced water. As the combined crews bring up a grid of buoys and notice a disturbance near ""Echo One-One"" (that would be E11) the Battleship grid has been revived onscreen. Theres something decidedly retro about the grid sequence where winning the war at sea has less to do with technology than with instincts trigger fingers and the equipment at hand. In fact theres something delightfully old-school about all the action in Battleship. As classic rock blasts in the background the movie increasingly shifts its attention away from the spinning glowing alien ships to the inner workings of mankinds floating fortresses paying tribute to veterans and the ingenuity of those in the armed forces. Sure its slightly jingoistic but when the aliens are calling for backup we want to cheer for our side. (UPDATE Richard Corliss Expands TIMEs List of Cinematic Greats) I have yet to even address the harrowing ways in which the history of Pearl Harbor factors into this war of the worlds. But it offers a rousing final act to a film of surprising dexterity alternating between sibling drama behind-enemy-lines strategizing naval war maneuvers big guns that go bang alien intelligence and a goofy spirit that shows Berg and company dont take this all that seriously after all. Heres an audacious inventive and character-driven blockbuster with some wit sprinkled in for good measure. Its fun and filled with a surprising degree of intrigue and suspense; an unlikely mix of Independence Day Pearl Harbor Jurassic Park and The Hunt for Red October. If it was called anything other than Battleship I wouldnt feel so guilty for loving every minute. Steven James Snyder thesnydes Im an Assistant Managing Editor at TIME.

(AP Photo/Universal Pictures) Photo Credit ILM/Universal Pict In this film publicity image released by Universal Pictures Tadanobu Asano left and Taylor Kitsch are shown in a scene from ""Battleship."" (AP Photo/Universal Pictures) They sank my Battleship.The old-school board game that lent its name to this newfangled special-effects flick was a harmless test of logic. The movie blows logic to smithereens.Sorry Hollywood but no matter how loudly you torture me I wont concede that a character like Alex Hopper is worth cheering for let alone capable of saving the world from an alien invasion. Hopper (Taylor Kitsch who captained the titanic flop ""John Carter"") is a hunky Hawaiian barfly who gets arrested and inexplicably released after trying to impress blonde hottie Sam (Brooklyn Decker). Alexs older brother Stone (Alexander Skarsgard) lays down the law Join the Navy -- or else.Without benefit of basic training Alex is transformed into a lieutenant aboard his brothers destroyer and Sam who is the daughter of Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson) is now magically his girlfriend. But before Alex can pop the question the Pacific Rim is attacked by a flotilla of flying saucers. Upping the ante on ""War of the Worlds"" the invaders have a mammoth mother ship that can lurk beneath the ocean surface until it is ready to lob its explosives.Were told that 25000 people are killed when Hong Kong gets leveled but the movie asks us to care more about Sam who is hiking on an Oahu mountaintop that the hipster-bearded iron-suited aliens covet as a communications hub. Meanwhile as the military brass loses contact with the destroyer fleet airhead Alex is forced to take command of his brothers crew (including sassy catch-phrase spouting Rihanna). With help from a smarter Japanese counterpart (Tadanobu Asano) Alex sniffs out the underwater aliens on a radar grid that mimics the board game.While the plot is tinny the heavy-metal effects are super-sized in the tradition of ""Transformers"" (from the same marketing apparatus). Proficient director Peter Berg (""Hancock"") keeps the noise so deafening we cant think about how preposterous it all is. An audacious reporting-for-duty climax involving veterans almost steers this wreck into comedic waters but its too little too late. Some guilty-pleasure cheese atop a ration of stale popcorn cant cleanse the distastefulness that ""Battleship"" leaves in its wake.""Battleship""Two stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 211  Content Intense sequences of action violence and strong language Videos Watch a trailer for Battleship May 16 2012 (...)

"Battleship is just another bored game |       NJ.com comments Battleship is just another bored game Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 17 2012 at 800 AM View/Post Comments Frank MasiTaylor Kitsch as Lieutenant Alex Hopper in ""Battleship."" Remember the rainy-day fun you used to have hunched down behind one of those plastic screens looking at a pegboard full of tiny gray ships calling out numbers and letters to a friend? Well they sunk our ""Battleship."" Sunk that pleasant game under a barrage of spectacular yet strangely ugly effects. Under an eardrum-blistering soundtrack of big explosions and arthritic rock. (AC/DC? Creedence? Really? Again?) The movies supposed to be about the Navys war on aliens. Instead it feels like an attack on the audience a blitzkrieg of schlock and ow. If it cant entertain us itll settle for bullying us into submission. It is photographed beautifully true. And with Taylor Kitsch Rihanna and Brooklyn Decker as stars it has some beautiful people to photograph. All that plus a fast pace keep it from being truly wretched. But none of it is enough to make it truly fun. The movie -- which seems to think that sound is somehow transmitted by laser beam -- starts out with NASAs antennas doing just that in hopes of contacting an alien civilization. Well guess what. We do and they decide to accept our invitation. Except theyre not coming to party. They land though just as the United States and Japan are engaged in joint naval exercises in Hawaii. (Politely -- or improbably -- nobody ever brings up Pearl Harbor or World War II even while aboard the U.S.S. Missouri.) So of course when the monsters land the brave sailors engage them. But whos to command? Could it be our brash young hero more given to brawling than sober leadership? Who wants nothing more than to impress his senior-officer brother -- and win over the big admiral whose lovely daughter he adores? Oh yeah. Could be. Its not just that the movie indulges in cliches -- of course it does. Its that unlike ""Independence Day"" it doesnt know theyre cliches. It presents them all without a wink -- right down to slow-motion shots of folks striding across flight decks or rivulets of sea water dripping languidly down perfect profiles. Nor does director Peter Berg -- who seems to be auditioning to take over the ""Transformers"" franchise or maybe the Navys new recruiting campaign -- have any fun with the effects. The alien warships are never more than jumbles of moving parts. The aliens are pale bearded things in what look like leftover ""Predator"" suits. Even the two nods to the original game -- projectiles that look like plastic pegs a nighttime duel based on guesses and graphing -- feel forced. (And why 100 minutes in does Earth finally have some luck destroying the aliens? Simply because its 100 minutes in and the movie needs to start wrapping things up.) Shorn of his ""John Carter"" locks Kitsch makes a good-looking hero in close-up (although the strapping actors hes surrounded with make him seem pocket-sized in longshot.) And Rihanna looks fierce in every sense of the word particularly when firing off big guns at some slimeball. (Chris Brown you stand warned.) But as big dumb summer movies go ... this is just another big dumb summer movie. And one that makes you feel slightly dumber for having watched it. Ratings note The film contains violence strong language and alcohol abuse. Battleship (PG-13) Universal (131 min.) Directed by Peter Berg. With Taylor Kitsch Rihanna Brooklyn Decker.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet There are moments in Battleship though theyre few and far between when the movie pauses to admit that yes its perhaps a little silly to adapt a strategy game about blindly firing missiles at boats in fixed positions. Hearing lines like ""Echo-1... hit"" as a missile clears a tall obstruction and lands on the other side is a giddy callback to the game and a reminder of the dumb fun to be had in seeing those plastic choking hazards brought to cinematic life. The rest of the time however Peter Bergs clanking noise-machine falls in line with Michael Bays Transformers model ensuring that the Hasbro brand is treated with the proper gravitas. The Marines got that commercial where the recruit slays the fire-spewing lava monster and now the Navy has its two-hour propaganda film about the glories of fighting alien invaders positioned in neat little quadrants at sea. Just try to forget its a toy. As the film opens NASA has discovered a ""Goldilocks planet"" in another galaxy so named because like Earth its neither too close nor too far from its sun and therefore just right to sustain life. In its infinite wisdom humanity has created special sonic lasers to poke this celestial hornets nest called ""Planet G"" and the alien life forms on Planet G answer the communique by sending five ships to eradicate Earth. (Which has it coming frankly.) Standing in the way are two brothers stationed with the Navy at Pearl Harbor one a promising fuckup (Taylor Kitsch) and the other a straitlaced tough guy (Alexander Skarsgard) plus a supporting cast of other naval officers (Liam Neeson Rihanna and Jesse Plemons among others) a tech nerd (a very funny Hamish Linklater) a paraplegic Army veteran (real-life Iraq vet Gregory D. Gadson) and Kitschs plucky love interest (Brooklyn Decker). Theres a shred of Starship Troopers-like political commentary about humanity needlessly provoking an enemy that has no interest in it but any such thoughts are blasted away in a hail of metal spaceballs and a Steve Jablonsky score (featuring producer Rick Rubin and guitarist Tom Morello) that sounds like Inception dropped down a flight of stairs. Despite some promising early goofiness involving full-contact soccer and the quest for a chicken burrito Battleship plays it regrettably straight most of the time as if the fate of the world really might rest on how well the Navy can hurtle projectiles at alien warships. With eyes closed the movie uncannily resembles a giant baby playing with pots and pans.

Battleship Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2012) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/battleship-2012,200,battleship28,battleship,rogerebert
"Battleship (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Battleship (PG-13) This sci-fi adventure inspired by the childrens board game embodies big-budget Hollywood at its worst. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com5/16/2012 Editor rating 1 Battleship is a board game for children so it stands to reason a film adaptation would also be aimed at kids. But did they have to gear it to really dumb kids? Halfway through this bloated movie the most undemanding 10-year-old is going to think about sneaking out and switching theaters to catch the end of The Avengers again. Battleship makes you reconsider every mean thing you ever said about Michael Bay Compared to this even Pearl Harbor starts looking good. At least that picture however misguided had a pulse. You could feel the intent of the filmmakers; you could tell what they striving for. All Battleship strives to do is separate you from your money. The only people who seem to be trying are the special effects crews particularly the sound mixers who must have racked up serious overtime coming up with cool whirs and booms and noises to accompany an extra-terrestrial invasion of our planet. The film is stuffed with ear candy. Particularly memorable is the grinding buzz made by the metallic orbs the aliens lob at Earth like ping pong balls - robotic Tasmanian Devils that devour everything in their path (concrete metal steel you name it). Battleship was directed by Peter Berg who is not without talent (he made The Rundown and The Kingdom and Hancock and Friday Night Lights). He shows the proper awe and respect for the movies superb computer-generated creations and he holds on shots long enough to allow you to take in the intricate details of the spacecraft (their missiles are shaped like the white and red pegs from the board game). He also shows you the stuff you want to see early on including a nice long close-up of what the aliens look like -- a cross between lizards and ZZ Top. But Berg also succumbs to the visual bombast that has become the unfortunate norm in action pictures Every single shot in Battleship even ones in which people are just talking looks like a glitzy hyper-stylized beer commercial. Worst of all Berg pays no attention to the logic and drive of his narrative. Characters appear and disappear without explanation. Periodically someone stops to sum up everything that has happened (the phrases ""So youre saying that ..."" and ""What Im saying is ..."" pop up a lot). The movie goes from popcorn-dumb to aggressively stupid At one point a hot chick in a Jeep saves the world by ramming her car into an alien thingamajig. One of the problems with movies like Battleship is that they corrupt and derail promising careers. Each of Bergs movies has been bigger and costlier than the last and now that hes gotten a taste of blockbuster success (Hancock earned more than 600 million and Battleship has already grossed 215 million overseas) hes unlikely to return to smaller more challenging filmmaking. Thats what happened to Brett Ratner who once talked about a Miami-based remake of The Killing of a Chinese Bookie but no longer seems interested in making a movie that costs less than 100 million. Ratner could have directed Battleship and his version would have probably looked a lot like this one. The script for Battleship which was written by brothers Erich and Jon Hoeber (Whiteout Red) includes an unforgivably long sequence in which the good guys stare at a giant radar grid that looks exactly like the board game and call out coordinates to use to fire at the aliens. One guy shouts ""Its a hit"" Another dude says ""They aint gonna sink this battleship"" Later someone else knocks over a large container of toys that crash to the floor and spill out toward the camera so we get a nice close-up of plastic battleship models that are probably available right now at a store near you. There are people in Battleship. Berg cast several real-life soldiers in supporting parts including Gregory D. Gadson an honored veteran who lost his legs in the Iraq War. In the lead role of a navy lieutenant who leads the charge against the baddies Taylor Kitsch runs around even more than he did in John Carter quoting Homer and Sun Tzu but always looking like he wished he was back on Mars. His girlfriend -- the one with the Jeep -- is played by Brooklyn Decker who looks so much like Charlize Theron that every time she appeared I kept thinking ""I didnt know Charlize Theron was in this movie"" Pop singer Rihanna makes her feature film debut as a petty officer with really good aim. Rihanna occasionally seems worried about flubbing her lines but mostly she radiates wicked cool and stoicism (she is also apparently the only female in the entire U.S. Navy; good thing shes a hottie) And then theres Liam Neeson. If youve seen the ads for Battleship you may think Liam Neeson stars in this movie. Those ads lied. Neesons role of a Navy Admiral is little more than an extended cameo -- his screen time amount to about 10 minutes out of the films two-plus hours -- and although hes too much of a professional to ever coast this is easily the laziest most distracted performance of his career. Like Nicolas Cage Neeson has started gravitating toward commercial pictures that use him as a presence more than as an actor. He doesnt really need to get into character He just has to show up. Thats pretty much all he does in Battleship Hes collecting his paycheck and he wants you sucker to foot the bill. Cast Taylor Kitsch Alexander Skarsgard Rihanna Brooklyn Decker Tadanobu Asano Jesse Plemons Gregory D. Gadson Liam Neeson. Director Peter Berg. Screenwriters Erich Hoeber Jon Hoeber. Producers Sarah Aubrey Peter Berg Brian Goldner. A Universal Pictures release. Running time 131 minutes. Vulgar language sci-fi violence. Opens Friday May 18 at area theaters.

That parts not newsworthy. The surprise for this veteran of board games is that Battleship is also the rousing engaging and emotionally complex action war picture the silly 2001 action war picture Pearl Harbor only wished it could be. Its Pearl Harbor with greater intelligence less hokum and more aliens. For every line of howler dialogue that should have been sunk theres a nice little scene in which humans have to make a difficult decision. For every stretch of generic sci-fi-via-CGI moviemaking theres a welcome bit of wit. Under the direction of Peter Berg -- the talented ever-maturing filmmaker behind Friday Night Lights and The Kingdom -- Battleship is a sound vessel floating in Hollywoods oil-slick sea of Transformers sequels and vampire riffs. The object of the original game is simple Attack an opponents ""fleet"" through a combination of mental strategy deductive logic and luck. The movie doesnt forget these low-tech roots. Theres a nifty sequence in which sailors track incoming alien fighters using similar X-marks-the-spot skills. But before getting to the hardcore blow-em-up portion of the humans-versus-aliens warfare entertainment we are given time to invest in the relationship between Stone Hopper (True Bloods Alexander Skarsgard) and his younger brother Alex (Taylor Kitsch from TVs Friday Night Lights) -- the former a courageous Navy officer of great character the latter a corner-cutting showboater who is about to have his character entirely re-welded through the Navy challenges that await him. (Kitsch does an admirable controlled job of steering his character from screwup to leader.) We understand that Alex loves a bombshell physical therapist named Sam (Brooklyn Decker) and that Sam happens to be the daughter of crusty U.S. Pacific Fleet commander Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson barking but not biting). We see the emotional-zeitgeist logic in the special interest that Sam has taken in the physical rehabilitation of an Army veteran and amputee authentically played by real-life Army vet and amputee Gregory D. Gadson. We appreciate the pop culture traffic jam that has musical glam girl Rihanna passing muster as a tough (yet cool) fellow sailor. And we know to keep an eye on the conflict that rumbles at first between Alex and a Japanese officer (Tadanobu Asano) because Japanese-American hurts and fears left over from the real Pearl Harbor will be worked out before the movie is over for the benefit of boomers and assorted granddads in the audience. Its only once we know all these things -- carbon-based touches not found in the Hasbro product -- that Battleship gets down to the business of hotshot combat between brave U.S. Navy fighters and aggressive alien visitors. (The invaders by the way appear to have studied Transformers fashion magazines to design their space-metal wardrobes.) Amid this fracas theres a welcome mood lightener in the form of a gentle comic-neurotic turn by Hamish Linklater (The New Adventures of Old Christine) as a deep-space scientist who has reason to regret his search for extraterrestrial life. Battleship is gratifying that way. At the storys center are all the clanging fireballs a kid could want to watch whizzing across a computerized sky -- not to mention naval strategy and a fact-based demonstration of real destroyer-ship capabilities. And surrounding the alien rumpus the filmmakers have built an unexpectedly sincere salute to the awesome responsibilities of todays U.S. Navy as well as to the heroic work of veterans who came before. For all that the captains of this movie deserve a medal.

The jovial and innocuous ""Battleship"" takes aim at its target audience and fires away delivering volley after volley of impressive special effects snicker-worthy dialogue goofball humor and -- best of all -- aliens vs. the Navy showdowns at sea.Does the big-budget behemoth hit the bulls-eye? No. It borrows much too heavily from other films especially ""Transformers"" and its first 20 minutes drag as it details the boneheaded antics of boy-man protagonist Alex Hooper (Taylor Kitsch of ""Friday Night Lights"") before he lands a gig in the Navy.But once those Transfomer-like alien ships divebomb into waters off Hawaii who really cares? At that point ""Battleship"" cranks it up and becomes a cinematic junk-food extravaganza thats better than it has any right to be.Sure it pales in comparison to the much smarter ""The Avengers"" but in summer a wide berth can be given for glossy eye candy like ""Battleship."" As a bonus theres no 3-D -- a nod perhaps to the low-tech source material that inspired the film -- the Hasbro board game. While the absence of eyewear is a welcome reprieve what makes this big-budget vehicle mostly see-worthy is that no one in its crew takes it seriously. That loose touch is reflected in the go-for-broke direction by Peter Berg (""The Kingdom"" and the ""Friday Night Lights"" TV series) and the decent if wobbly screenplay from Jon and Erich Hoeber the duo that hammed it up (better) in the action gem ""Red"" with Bruce Willis.Advertisement The premise is simple and uninspired even if theres a surprisingly effective development near the end NASA transmits a message to an Earth-like planet in another galaxy and in return receives a rude response -- an invasion off Hawaii To dress up an overused scenario while tipping their hat at the original board game the writers toss in a bunch of razor-sharp projectile cylinders that can tear through ships and roadways. In between truly cheesy dialogue like ""were looking at an extinction level event"" the Hoebers slip in some choice nuggets including a couple of lines delivered with standout polish by Liam Neeson. The talented actor -- who has a very small role -- plays Admiral Shane an imposing figure whose daughter Sam (Brooklyn Decker in a featherweight part) is dating the screw-up Alex. And Kitsch who didnt exactly collect out-of-this-world notices for ""John Carter"" proves detractors wrong by showing he can convincingly carry an action film even when his character is a ""Top Gun"" clone.Others in the cast are nice to have around but dont have much heavy lifting to do. Pop star Rihanna playing a private capably recites lines like ""Got it sir"" The diva has presence exactly what the role requires but not much more.Alexander Skarsgard (""True Blood"") is his charismatic self as Alexs far more disciplined and respected brother; hes a Navy commander but hes not around much. As a jittery scientist Hamish Linklater is hilarious while Gregory D. Gadson shows promise as an Iraq veteran who tangles with the aliens.Not all of ""Battleship"" works. But even when youre laughing at it -- not with it -- the blockbuster remains silly fun leaks and all.Battleship   1/2Rating PG-13 (intense sequences of violence action and destruction and for language)Cast Taylor Kitsch Alexander Skarsgard Rihanna Brooklyn Decker Liam NeesonDirector Peter BergRunning time 2 hours 11 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Talend Silicon Valleys latest tech IPO has a strong debutSource Tesla looking at cameras radar in Florida crashCartoons Hillary Clinton makes history Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Battleship Fair Director Peter Berg. Cast Taylor Kitsch Rihanna Liam Neeson. Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of violence action and destruction and for language. Sometime between ""Friday Night Lights"" -- Berg directed the film and developed the brilliant television series -- and his new movie ""Battleship"" evidently. Lets hope that this summers films dont engage in big-bang one-upmanship because after being pummeled by deafening explosions for the better part of two-plus hours Im not sure audiences could take it. YOURE ALREADY GOING TO LEAVE THE THEATER TALKING LIKE THIS. Battleship plays money game to win On that front Berg has picked up with ""Battleship"" where Bay left off with his ""Transformers"" movies (of which no installment appears this summer) which can most accurately be described as big loud and dumb. Happily ""Battleship"" is a little better than that. Not a lot -- this is a movie based on a board game after all with a little romance and a lot of alien attack thrown in for good measure. You probably dont remember any of that when you were saying ""E-4"" to your friend when you were a kid trying to guess the location of his battleship because it wasnt there. There is a funny nod to the games strategy midway through the movie though by then you may be too woozy to notice. The film begins with underachieving Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch) having beers with his brother Navy officer Stone (Alexander Skarsgard) before getting into trouble over the beautiful Sam (Brooklyn Decker). Whats worse for Stone is that Sam is the daughter of an admiral (Liam Neeson). Disgusted with his brother Stone comes up with an unusual idea He makes Alex join the Navy. Next thing you know Alex is a lieutenant -- huh? -- and he his brother the admiral and Sam all wind up in Hawaii about to undertake a massive training exercise with other countries. A pre-maneuvers soccer match leads to a confrontation with Capt. Yugi Nagata (Tadanobu Asano) an equally headstrong officer in the Japanese fleet. If only some event could bring these two together. Oh. And then aliens attack. So thats covered. They have arrived because at the beginning of the film scientists discover Planet G which is somewhat similar in makeup to Earth -- enough so that its thought life could exist there. Well it does and after we beam a signal to its residents here they come and for whatever reason they arent happy. The aliens seal off a big chunk of ocean and eventually only the U.S.S. John Paul Jones of which guess who is now the commanding officer -- yes yes its Alex -- is left inside the perimeter to defend the world against extermination. Happily we have Rihanna as a weapons specialist on our side. Intrepid Earthlings figure out that the aliens want to communicate with their planet so in addition to fending off attacks we have to destroy a string of communication towers. Naturally thats where Sam a physical therapist now in love with Alex has taken a double-amputee wounded in battle for exercise (he is played by real-life veteran Gregory D. Gadson who lost his legs fighting in Iraq). The movie drags on way too long but there are things to like. One is the general inefficiency of the aliens ships and weapons; maybe theyve got the travel-through-space thing down but they havent come up with a foolproof death ray or anything and their ships kind of hop around in the water. The aliens themselves are also interesting almost human but not quite. Hamish Linklater is funny as a scientist who is um urged to find courage by Gadsons wounded soldier. And its great to see Kitsch paired again with fellow ""Friday Night Lights"" cast member Jesse Plemons who plays a sailor. But these are small things in a massively scaled movie. Like most other details they tend to get lost in the explosions and noise which are sure signs of summer at the movies if not really welcome ones.

"Battleship | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; battleship ) Battleship (United States 2012) May 15 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Let me start this review off on a positive note. Battleship is in 2-D not 3-D so there are no issues with motion blur low light levels and general eye discomfort. There are some nice establishing shots of Hawaii; I might want to go there if I wasnt afraid aliens would suddenly show up and ruin my vacation. Peter Berg the actor-turned-director known in some quarters for hand-held camera work found a tripod somewhere. And Liam Neeson with his bank account nicely padded by this and Wrath of the Titans can go back to using his considerable talent in worthy projects. When it was announced that a major motion picture would be made based on the board game ""Battleship"" I had trouble containing my amusement. ""Whats next?"" I wondered. ""Solitaire?"" Yet the more I considered the more I realized the basic premise of ""Battleship"" could work within the context of a movie. Visions of a Tom Clancy-like thriller rattled around in my head. A dog-and-cat duel with a Das Boot flavor. So what do we get? Independence Day meets Pearl Harbor with a very strong Transformers influence. Attentive viewers will also catch steals from Alien Star Trek (J.J. Abrams reboot iteration) Titanic and about a hundred other sources. Battleship has the IQ of a rutabaga and doesnt require much more intelligence than that to watch. Despite spending copious amounts of time with back story and so-called character development its really all about the explosions. The recipe for maximum enjoyment is simple. Settle down in your seat and take a 30-minute nap. Wake up when you hear a loud noise. Stay awake until the flashes and bangs subside then take another nap. Repeat for the next 90 minutes. Then go home. Or better yet dust off an old copy of ""Battleship"" and play it with friends and family. In the time it takes to travel to and from the theater buy tickets and view Battleship you can play that game plus ""Monopoly"" and ""Risk."" Battleship begins with an intolerable 35 minutes of setup. During the course of this segment I found myself thinking Please hurry up and get to the aliens. Then they arrive and predictably my train of thought changed to Please go back to the setup. So it goes. The aliens in Battleship are typical antisocial movie xenomorphs. They exist exclusively to destroy things. Theres no motivation. They just show up play a giant game of ""Battleship"" (yes they find a way to shoehorn in a few rounds) help our hero to grow up then fall prey to a deus ex machina. They are clearly inspired by the bad guys in Independence Day and Skyline. In Transformers for all its problems at least there was a reason for the big bad robots to do what they were doing - not that I could tell you what it was. Thats not the case here. Something curious happens to the space ships/attack craft during the course of Battleship. Maybe its the salt water. Maybe its the air. Maybe its careless script writing. At the outset the aliens crafts are damn near invulnerable. By the end however theyre more brittle than paper machA(c) and as fragile as a Ford Pinto. This sort of (lack of) internal consistency makes Battleship a less than rewarding experience. Who cares if the good guys win if the rules of the game have to be changed midway through to give them the victory? Thats called cheating. Battleship begins by introducing us to brothers Lieutenant Annoying (Taylor Kitsch - can you think of a better name?) and Commander Stick-Up-His-Ass (Alexander Skarsgard trying without success to suppress his accent). The former is trying to steal a burrito to impress Hot Blond At The Bar (Brooklyn Decker). Skip forward six years. Annoying is preparing to marry Hot Blond but in order to do so he has to ask permission from her dad Admiral Zeus (Liam Neeson). This happens against the background of an international peace building activity of Naval wargames and soccer. The Japanese win on the sports field but one senses they wont be winning in the water. Then the aliens show up and spoil the party. They seal off Hawaii and the nearby ocean locking most of the fleet out of an impenetrable dome. Three ships remain inside. Annoying gets his first command when everyone of a higher rank on his destroyer ends up dead. Meanwhile Hot Blond becomes involved in a superfluous land-based subplot that pairs her with Token Disabled Veteran (Gregory D. Gadson). This serves two purposes showing off the actress legs and adding to the bloated running length. Lets play a game of figuring out which name doesnt belong Taylor Kitsch Brooklyn Decker Rhianna Liam Neeson. If you picked Neeson you win the prize. Hes a real actor not a model or a singer or a guy with nice bone structure. To be fair Kitsch has a decent number of credits to his name - he was a lead in the TV version of Friday Night Lights (where he connected with Berg) and he was the title character in the much-maligned John Carter. His persona in Battleship is so irritating that he succeeds where the aliens fail - providing someone on-screen to hate. When it comes to the humans in Battleship theres an outbreak of Transformers disease. They dont matter. Theyre not even interesting enough to be called stereotypes. They exist because the filmmakers dont have the balls to assemble 70 minutes of special effects explosions and disaster footage and call it a ""movie."" I guess the only reason why Neeson was hired is so viewers would realize at least one person isnt a CGI creation. Of course his role is no more than a glorified cameo so dont get too excited about him opening a can of whoop-ass on the aliens. He doesnt even get to give a Bill Pullman speech. His biggest moment is when he hangs up on the Secretary of Defense. Battleship is a true summer movie. It exists because this is what studios think movie-goers want as the weather warms in the northern hemisphere. People go because the marketing and advertising tease them into thinking theyre going to see a film rather than a bunch of faux actors playing second fiddle to creepy looking functionally challenged mechanical things created on someones computer. Every year we get a few productions like this where frontal lobotomies enhance the experience and long trips to the rest room and snack counter break up the monotony. Battleship is dumb noisy and flashy. Expecting anything else would be foolish.

Plastic parts are the least of its worries Battleship a commercial for alternately the military or Michael Bays back catalog feels sunken from an overdose of charmless grunting and computer-generated ballast. Aliens (huh?) rain fiery destruction on Hong Kong then upon a mysteriously dome-sealed portion of the South Pacific requiring the tactical response of naval-officer brothers Stone (Alexander Skarsgard) and Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch). Separated from the war theater fleet commander Shane (Liam Neeson evidently putting a pool in) scowls on helplessly. Slo-mo salutes and bikini-filling Brooklyn Decker place us squarely in Armageddon territory--par for the course but slackened by a complete absence of comic relief. We dawdle Whats the word on the film debut of Rihanna playing a sass-mouthed petty officer? Dreadful (ella ella). An old-farts sequence of USS Missouri vets getting in on the payback might stir the heartstrings of mission-accomplished types but little else will grab anyone who actually recalls playing the board game. For a second the alien munitions look a lot like those peg pieces that would get lost under the couch cushions. Bring on the big-screen Monopoly--Im not even kidding unfortunately.

Peter Bergs Battleship which I swear to God is described in its Wikipedia entry as an ""American science fiction action naval war film"" is one such movie.Over the past few years the military-industrial-entertainment complex has been going great guns with salutes to the Army (fellow Hasbro production G.I. Joe) Navy SEALs (Act of Valor) and now this 200 million hail to the fleet which takes up the unusual task of extrapolating a story arc from that game with the little red plastic pegs principally remembered as being easy to cheat at. (The screenplay by Jon and Erich Hoeber goes through such extraordinary narrative contortions in order to justify an allusion to the games familiar grid-work board and guessing-game strategy its probably deserving of some sort of award.)Establishing its tendency to shuttle between intimate soap opera and planetary-scale cataclysm Battleship begins with the news that scientists have discovered and are attempting to make contact with a solar body in a distant galaxy--""Planet G"" whose atmospheric conditions are possibly favorable to life--using a transmitter in Hawaii. This is where we join shaggy Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch) sousing away his 26th birthday at an Oahu bar picking up Samantha (Brooklyn Decker) with an act of nutty bravado while his straitlaced Navy-lifer big brother Stone (Alexander Skarsgard) looks on disapprovingly.When we next catch up with the Hoppers Alex--now Lieutenant Hopper having been forcibly recruited for his own good by his brother--is still a disciplinary case and cant win the approval of Samanthas father Pacific Fleet admiral Shane (Liam Neeson). On the eve of the multinational RIMPAC naval exercises Alex is on the brink of being busted out of the service while at the same time vast cool and unsympathetic intellects on Planet G are regarding this earth with envious eyes. The space invaders splash down a few crafts quite reminiscent in their intricately shifting movable-parts design and metallic cacophony to leftover Hasbro Transformers. The extraterrestrials themselves are Homo sapien-like except they have claw-machine-grabber hands quill-like goatees and cool military hardware like Google glasses and forcefield technology which they use to seal off the Hawaiian islands. This effectively strands the assembled fleets of the Pacific Rim out at sea leaving only destroyer USS John Paul Jones inside the last craft capable of preventing the aliens from using the transmitting equipment to dial up reinforcements meaning an end to life on this planet as we know it. It should go without saying that the JPJ is the ship crewed by out-of-his-depth LieutenantAlex and--why not?--Rihanna.Peter Berg creator of Friday Night Lights and director of the estimable The Rundown is in street-fighting mode here--that is he does not hesitate to pull any dirty trick in order to get the job done. I was able to withstand the emotional suction when hothead Alex suddenly cut off from his relied-upon sibling learned to control his temper tamp down his ego and appreciate the value of teamwork. I restrained with effort the palpitations of One World sentiment when Hopper and his former foe on the soccer pitch Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force Captain Nagata (Tadanobu Asano) banded together to resist another sneak attack in the common protection of all mankind exorcising the ghost of Pearl Harbor. I was even able to maintain my composure just barely when the double-amputee ex-Army hero played by Iraq vet Gregory D. Gadson--shades of Harold Russell in The Best Years of Our Lives--got his wish to play soldier again. But by the time the crew of old salts who had weathered Okinawa Iwo Jima and Korea emerged deus ex machine-style to serve their country once more I was a lost cause. And when the F-14s came out for a triumphant flyover I looked around the room to find the moron who was applauding only to realize that it was me.

TWITTER Universals noisy alien-invasion tentpole plays like just-add-water ""Transformers."" The grid-based board game that provides the jumping-off point for this extravagantly noisy spectacle is not known for its narrative thrust and neither is Battleship particularly interested in story. At once silly and overly ponderous it is a long-winded exercise in cartoonish war games pitting a splinter section of the U.S. Navy against invading aliens -- a sort of just-add-water Transformers. But those looking for big loud sci-fi action will find plenty to like here as director Peter Berg (Hancock Friday Night Lights) pumps up the volume on clashing military hardware and flag-waving heroics. The Universal release should open strongly in international markets and gather steam heading into its U.S. release on May 18. PHOTOS 28 of Summers Most Anticipated Movies A rather niftily engineered sequence midway through Battleship references the board game owned by Hasbro the company thats already made millions from its Transformers and G.I. Joe franchises. Its a rare offering of wit from screenwriting brothers Erich and Jon Hoeber (RED) who otherwise ensure the impressive visual effects and Bergs epic set pieces fight against an armada of cinematic cliches and some truly awful dialogue. ""Lets see if we can buy the world another day"" is one veteran soldiers rallying cry while elsewhere Taylor Kitschs maverick hero weathers a half-hour barrage of alien strikes before muttering ""Ive got a bad feeling about this."" Risible yes. But who could expect more from the one-dimensional characters Berg moves around on the board -- sorry screen -- as they shout to be heard above the clank and screech of metal and Steve Jablonskys blaring score. At least no ones taking things too seriously with pop star Rihanna seemingly having the most fun as a plucky weapons specialist who scampers about the USS John Paul Jones making things go boom. VIDEO Battleship Trailer The ship is one of three left stranded inside a force field after a fleet of gigantic alien spaceships interrupts a routine exercise between Japanese and American sailors off the coast of Hawaii. The extraterrestrials have been summoned by an exploratory signal sent into the depths of space and although the bristly bearded creatures come across as more curious than overtly hostile a trigger-happy Navy engages and enters the fray. Alex Hopper (Kitsch) is the loose-cannon lieutenant suddenly charged with saving the world from what one character solemnly dubs ""an extinction-level threat."" Hes a formerly long-haired slacker who has cleaned up his act and joined the Navy after an ultimatum from his straitlaced captain brother Stone (Alexander Skarsgard). Alex is still hot-headed though which gets him in trouble with grouchy Admiral Crane (Liam Neeson in a paycheck role) the father of his lissom fiancee Samantha (Brooklyn Decker). Samantha is a physical therapist who has her own role to play in saving the world from destruction Back on shore she teams up with a double-amputee war hero (real-life Iraq veteran Gregory D. Gadson) and a comic-relief communications nerd (Hamish Linklater) to prevent the ETs from phoning home. Kitsch coming off the super-flop John Carter soft-pedals the charm exuding just enough charisma to get by. The striking-looking Skarsgard (True Blood) is ramrod-straight and impossibly grave throughout while Deckers expression toggles between blank and very blank. Theres much to admire in the enthusiasm and craft Berg brings to the action but in the wake of the Transformers movies success the look is obviously funneled through a Michael Bay-shaped aperture.

Proportional strategy and luck are required to win Battleship the family board game Peter Bergs loudly proudly ridiculous soldiers-vs.-aliens blockbuster rather fancifully claims as its source. As played by Taylor Kitschs beefy Navy lieutenant however victory requires no such niceties -- just the biggest explosives the military can provide. Overlong and underwritten even by the standards of summer f/x extravaganzas this ""Battleship"" will nonetheless float with many on the strength of its boyish eager-to-please razzle-dazzle. Bowing in Europe a month before its U.S. opening pic should perform robustly enough to greenlight the sequel patently set up by its post-credits sting. Having already parlayed its beloved G.I. Joe and Transformers action figures into hit Hollywood franchises toy manufacturing giant Hasbro has now turned its attention to its classic board-game collection. On the surface the idea isnt as silly as it seems A board game after all has more of a built-in narrative structure than a doll though Battleships miss-hit-sink trajectory perhaps tells a simpler story than most. Certainly a lot of ships get sunk in fraternal writing duo Jon and Erich Hoebers screenplay though there the similarity ends; theres nary an in-joke about the game to be found here. Indeed rather surprisingly coming from the writers of ""Red"" attempts at hip humor are few and far between; the film mostly lets the missiles do the talking. Extended pre-credits sequence gets past its science with impressive haste Were here to play after all not to learn. The need-to-knows are that a ""Goldilocks planet"" (close enough to and far enough from the sun in order to sustain life and therefore just right) has been discovered by NASA in a separate galaxy; the inhabitants of Planet G have responded to scientists interstellar communications and decided to pay a visit to Earth. Cut to Oahu Hawaii where jobless layabout Alex (Kitsch) is celebrating his 26th birthday in a dive bar with disapproving older brother Stone (Alexander Skarsgard) a straitlaced Navy recruit. After Alex commits a drunken infraction designed to impress leggy physiotherapist Samantha (Brooklyn Decker) Stone issues a final-straw demand Alex is to join him in the Navy. In seemingly no time at all Alex has graduated to lieutenant level despite equally feckless behavior in uniform and is in a serious relationship with Samantha whose stern dad (Liam Neeson) just happens to be commander of the Pacific fleet. All principals are conveniently involved then when Planet Gs alien spacecraft crashes into the Pacific and rises ominously from the depths near the naval base in Oahu. A reconnaissance mission led by Alex and scrappy female officer Raikes (Rihanna) aggravates the visitors into opening fire setting the stage for a protracted series of back-and-forth pyrotechnic attacks of increasing sound and fury until an abruptly curtailed finale. The comparatively limp mainland action meanwhile finds Samantha weathering the storm with paraplegic Army veteran Mick (real-life Iraq hero Gregory D. Gadson) and technical geek Cal (Hamish Linklater) who devises a way to break the aliens communication wall. ""Ive got a bad feeling about this"" mutters Alex a veritable Cassandra of the high seas -- and thats after two destroyer ships have already been blown to smithereens. Bright enough to quote Homer back at his commanding officer but dim enough to think the Japanese wrote ""The Art of War"" hes too blandly inscrutable a hero to root for with much enthusiasm which goes for most of the characters. The exception is Deckers Samantha whos so unctuously inexpressive we might actively root for her demise under one of the enemys flaming razor-balls. The aliens encased in markedly Power Ranger-like suits are no more defined in personality or motivation making it rather easy to sit back and enjoy the fireworks without taking sides any more than one would while observing say a game of Battleship between two strangers. (Maybe theres something to the screenwriters claims after all.) The attractive cast does no more than Berg and the script require which is very little indeed. After ""John Carter"" Kitsch is still waiting for a film vehicle to make good on the easy authentic charm he exhibits in TVs ""Friday Night Lights"" though hes physically up to the task here. Fans of pop megastar Rihanna making her film debut will be disappointed to find that the role of Raikes may as well be renamed Young Female Demographic for all the pertinence it has to the narrative but shes a sparky enough presence. Tech credits are all polished if not as metallically sleek as they would be with a Michael Bay-style craftsman at the helm. Tobias Schliessers lensing covers the teal-and-orange palette seemingly mandatory for such adventures these days while Steve Jablonskys score thumps and drones away with nary a pause little betraying the presence of rock super-producer Rick Rubin and Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello on the music team. The bulk of the attention in this evidently expensive production has been lavished on Industrial Light amp; Magics typically immaculate effects which are firmly in the ""Transformers"" mold stylistically with the added challenge of water simulation. That such state-of-the-art creations have been used to realize a story whose climax hinges on a true-life WWII battleship USS Missouri outlasting its newer shinier rivals is an irony probably lost on all involved.
