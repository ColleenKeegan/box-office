Comments Out Cold As if to justify a serious discussion of this comedy before dissing it some reviewers have pointed out that it evokes Casablanca. Maybe thats why the plot seems imposed on the characters--a lovesick master snowboarder and his fellow daredevils who work though not so youd notice at an Alaskan mountain resort thats up for sale. Brendan and Emmett Malloy directed a screenplay by Jon Zack; with Jason London and Lee Majors. 90 min.

"USATODAY.com - Out Cold has a chilling effect on laughter Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 11/21/2001 - Updated 1002 AM ET Out Cold has a chilling effect on laughter By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Out Cold is as lost as vacationers stranded in a blizzard. This is a movie () that cant decide what direction its going in. Some of the time it seems to be a standard teen sex comedy. Occasionally it appears to be spoofing the genre. It concludes on a romantic almost honorable note. Perhaps the schizophrenic feeling comes from the fact that there are two directors (Brendan and Emmett Malloy) at the helm -- though there have been enough successful films by brother teams including the Farrellys the Coens the Hughes and the Wachowskis to dispel that notion. But the Malloys movie doesnt come close to the least of the works by those other sibling duos. Actually Out Cold doesnt seem to aspire to be much more than a collection of extreme snowboarding scenes the seductive antics of scantily clad bimbos and plenty of drunken partying. There is a plot buried somewhere under the snowdrifts. Alaskas remote Bull Mountain draws a motley crew of snowboarding bums whose motto is ""Carpe the Diem Seize the Carp."" It was developed by Papa Muntz who all the guys revere because he died on skis with booze in hand and his drawers dropped bellowing ""Dont go changin Bull Mountain."" But the climbs they are a-changing. With visions of a world-class resort in charges Lee Majors as John Majors. Majors/Majors buys the mountain from Muntzs wimpy son (Willie Garson). The towns rustic bar El Matador becomes the Powder Room and its mechanical bull is tossed out on its horn (after some seductive bronco riding from the above-mentioned bimbos of course). The movies hero is the sweetly sensitive yet macho Rick (Jason London) who pines for the wholesome Anna (Caroline Dhavernas). Anna turns out to be Majors daughter. And she also has a handsome fiance so poor Rick must cope by hanging out with his hapless pals who are usually drunk indulging in some perversion with an amorous polar bear or getting a tender body part caught in a hot-tub jet. And if these scenes arent enough to make you cringe there are also some humor-free segments featuring flatulence and defecation. Even though Disneys Touchstone division distributes Out Cold dont bring the kids. Like some other recent PG-13 movies this one really qualifies for an R rating given its graphic crude and sexual humor. And theres even gratuitous violence A child hurls a bottle at an adult who is trying to control the crowd during a melee. Theres a good lesson for todays youth. About all thats worth watching are the snowboarding scenes. The movie opens with a five-minute sequence in which a snowboarder hot dogs down a mountain and jumps a few cliffs. Even though no one in the film breaks a leg Out Cold is as lame as it gets.

Starring Jason London Lee Majors. Directed by Emmett and Brendan Malloy. (PG-13. 89 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Sometimes the pairing of actress and role is so exquisite as to inspire awe. Victoria Silvstedt who plays snow bunny Inga in ""Out Cold"" is a former Miss Sweden Playmate of the Year and yes Swedish ski team member. Silvstedt is the totemic goddess for the adolescent and arrested-adolescent males for whom this Warren Miller-meets-""American Pie"" comedy was made. A purposely inane mishmash of maudlin love story gastrointestinal gags and shredding snowboard scenes ""Out Cold"" has a couple of laughs but mostly wipes out. Jason London (""Dazed and Confused"") plays the linchpin of a group of resort workers who spend their days boarding and their nights boozing. Still pining for his lost summer love he gently rejects the advances of the slackers female mascot. The movies heroes are over the hill for this lifestyle if not over the mountain. But theyve got a purpose darn it to stop a corporate titan from ruining their straggly Alaskan village. When Lee Majors can steal every scene hes in your movies in trouble. As the resorts new owner John Majors (an obvious nod to the actor and perhaps to the former British prime minister) Majors exudes snaky charm and faux folksiness. He also looks suspiciously comfortable in his black Western suits and gaudy gold bolo ties. When he first spots the resort the new owner quips ""This place looks like a motel ate a yard sale and barfed it up."" The former ""Six Million Dollar Man"" has the same aging grandeur as William Shatner; everything stops when he comes onscreen which is a good thing here. When London discovers his lost love in Majors daughter he goes into a tailspin. London makes his characters mooning palpable though its out of context in this film. His romantic dilemma cant stir up much interest Both the co-worker and the owners daughter are blandly attractive to the same degree. Its also hard to get worked up about the fellows mission to rid their mountain of corporate greed. Majors is just too enjoyable to be a real villain even when the movie turns his character into a buffoon. Plus the board bums really need to move on. Theres a lot to be said for just enjoying ones life without ambition but not enough here. Zach Galifianakis as the oldest and the drunkest of the lot almost makes a case for the wastrel existence. With full Grizzly Adams beard and a flair for physical comedy Galifianakis is so obviously enjoying himself that he draws the viewer into his high jinks. He even draws laughs from a painfully derivative penis gag. Director brothers Brendan and Emmett Malloy who have made surf documentaries and music clips for the Foo Fighters and Blink 182 show visual expertise in a couple of thrilling boarding scenes. There should have been more of those. Before the credits the Malloys run outtakes of funny moments and a couple of spectacular snowboard crashes. This stuff might have improved the picture had it made the final cut. Advisory This film contains raw language and gross-out humor.
