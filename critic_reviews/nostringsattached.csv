With this wisecracking romcom she seems to be saying she wants nothing to do with the usual does-my-butt-look-big-in-this? chick flicks. But while No Strings Attached makes a good stab at a mainstream comedy of sexual mores its not really as radical as it wants to be and never leaves us in any doubt whether its glossy gorgeous leads will get it on or not.Written by 29-year-old playwright Elizabeth Meriwether the script is frank and sharply observed in places - but with an annoying habit of dropping in vulgar sex-slang for shock-factor (tunnel buddies for men whove slept with the same woman anyone?). The story is an update of When Harry Met Sally can men and women be friends without having sex? Twenty-two years later the question is now can they be friends and have sex - without getting into a relationship?Portman produces and stars as a doctor who falls into bed with Ashton Kutcher. Neither wants a steady (his last one ran off with his stoner TV star dad Kevin Kline) so they establish rules no breakfast pet names or romance. Portman can look smug in light-touch comedy but her chemistry with Kutcher is believable (though to be fair Kutcher is the golden retriever of male leads blandly irresistable). Meriwether who is in a writing posse with Diablo Cody (Juno) dubbed the Fempire has the most fun with cracking supporting roles from Kline and mumblecores Greta Gerwig as Portmans flatmate.

By Peter Rainer Film critic January 21 2011 Save for later Saved Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher maintain a wavering relationship in No Strings Attached. Paramount/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Going in for a double dose of angst this season Natalie Portman turns from ""Black Swan"" to play Emma a young doctor in ""No Strings Attached"" who scampers away from emotional attachments. Her prime attachee is Ashton Kutchers Adam an aspiring TV writer and the son of a famous blowhard sitcom star played by Kevin Kline.The stereotypical gender role reversal here is the gimmick. Emma is the one who just wants a sexual relationship without any emotional overload while Adam who plays along with the setup inevitably falls for her. Why he does so is something of a mystery since Emma while undeniably smart and pretty is also undeniably abrasive. Since Adam doesnt seem like the masochistic type his puppyish sweet-souled love for her registers as more of a plot convenience than a plausibility.Related Ten best movies of 2010 Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? No doubt there is a vast young audience out there clamoring to know the answer to the films conundrum about whether friends can have sex and still be friends. The answer provided here - one of many reasons why this film is not as ""daring"" as it pretends - is a resounding ""no."" (This is no junior-division ""Last Tango in Paris."") That answer will likely make the film a big date-night smash although these days who knows what qualifies as a date movie? I thought ""Black Swan"" would be the worst date movie since ""Saw 3D"" but I was wrong. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Director Ivan Reitman and screenwriter Elizabeth Meriwether start things out with a peppy off-color spiritedness and the early scenes between Emma and Adam when they groggily then avidly hook up are sharp. Its when the movie lurches into seriousness when Adam realizes he wants more than serial hookups and Emma cant figure out what she wants that the movie regresses into a standard sudser. The film isnt helped by Klines cameo although his comic timing is impeccable. The problem is that what hes timing - the role of an aging ego-swelled roue - is very tired stuff.Kutcher is charming enough. Hes not exactly stretching which is probably just as well. Portman looks at times as perplexed as we do about what she is supposed to be playing. Emmas avoidance of emotional ties is given no psychological underpinnings beyond a few flip Freudianisms. But at least Portman is playing someone who is recognizably human unlike her dancer in ""Black Swan"" where she was a projection of the directors pop-schlock fantasies done up in a high-art tutu. The sexual pas de deux in ""No Strings Attached"" are a lot more down to earth.

Comments (1) click to enlarge No Strings Attached Video Rated R  110 minutes  2011 All the ingredients for a fine contemporary comedy are here including a pertinent theme (the difficulty of finding love amid career obligations and easy sex) and an assortment of courageous young actors (Natalie Portman Ashton Kutcher Greta Gerwig Olivia Thirlby). Unfortunately the director is Ivan Reitman whos never made a more emotionally complex film than Meatballs (1979). Telling the story of a med student (Portman) and an aspiring TV writer (Kutcher) who try to navigate a ""sex friendship"" without falling in love Reitman settles for easy laughs and his off-color jokes about menstruation and drug use feel like greeting-card gags. The charismatic leads keep this watchable but its a waste of their talents.

By David Edelstein Published Jan 21 2011 ShareThis (Photo Dale Robinette/Courtesy of Paramount Pictures) In the high-concept romantic comedy No Strings Attached the woman who wants lots of sex with zero emotional commitment isnt portrayed as a slut which is a nice change. She does however come off as a head case. Emma (Natalie Portman) a brainy medical resident has a highly satisfying quickie with an old summer-camp acquaintance Adam (Ashton Kutcher) and flush with pleasure proposes they use each other physically. After accepting her terms (no breakfast together no flowers etc.) Adam promptly tries to take their relationship to the next level which drives Emma crazy for the good reason that well there is no good reason. Although the snappy script is by a woman Elizabeth Meriwether and the standard gender roles are reversed (the female is the brusque professional the male the clingy sex object) the movie never makes the case for Emmas point of view. You dont see for an instant why a young woman in a high-pressure residency might be wise to approach a relationship warily. You dont seegiven that Adam is gorgeous funny kind talented and to cap it off richany impediment whatsoever to happily-ever-afterdom. Its no wonder a guy behind me muttered Whats her problem? Her problem I think is that shes a Frankensteinian studio construct with mismatched parts. No Strings Attached began life as Fuck Buddies (or Famp; Buddies or some variation thereof) and Im guessing that in the course of its evolution anything messy or dissonantany real dramawas discarded along with any credible accounting for what Emma calls her allergy to relationships. So the movie plays as a long and rather cruel proof that the no strings attached doctrine cant work and that Emma is a freak for believing otherwise. (There are pre-Code movies from the early thirties with less old-fashioned ideas about casual sex.) A different actress might have filled in some gaps but Portmanas intelligent as she isdoesnt have much imagination. If George Lucas gives her wooden dialogue shell be wooden to the core. If Darren Aronofsky makes her his masochistic marionette shell twirl and hurl on cue. As Emma she dutifully oscillates between brittle detachment and hysterical neediness but the why-why-whys remain unanswered. Director Ivan Reitman with his anvil touch is no help He has zero affinity for his female characters and seems to have made the movie to get in on his son Jasons Zeitgeist-comedy action. (Is it a coincidence that Adams celebrity dad played by Kevin Kline steals his sons girlfriend?) Apart from a surreally dizzy turn by Lake Bell as a TV producer with a crush on Adam the trendy cast is wasted. (Greta Gerwig as Emmas roommate is confined to sympathetic smirks.) No Strings Attached is so palpably calculated that you know if the camera had pulled back a foot from the bed in which Portman and Kutcher were pretending to have sex youd have seen their agents standing by beaming proud parents proud pimps. First Blue Valentine now from Denmark Applause In less than a month Ive had to endure two intense psychodramas in which the jittery handheld camera hovers dermatologist-close to actors faces beset by seismic waves of grief and rage. Both have a certain too-muchness but both in the end give you something to see. In Applause its the amazingly named Paprika Steen who looks like Natasha Richardson if shed lived longer and much much harder. Steen is Thea an alcoholic leading actress appearing onstage as Martha in Albees Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf? while offstage slowly waking up from the nightmare that has been her life. Her ex-husband remarried her opposite numberan unhistrionic psychologistand she hasnt seen her young sons in a couple of years. Now she wants them back. Over and over she insists Ive changeda line thats a reliable indicator of someone who hasnt. Director Martin Pieter Zandvliet cuts in snatches of the Albee play with metronomic regularitybut with an actress this magnificent the scaffolding barely shows. Steen draws a fluid line between Thea-as-Martha and Thea in the real world putting on make-up pretending to be something she isnt trying to achieve some measure of autonomy in the grip of an ungovernable ego. As much of her as there is youll want more. No Strings AttachedParamount Pictures. R. ApplauseWorld Wide Motion Pictures Corporation. R. E-mail filmcriticnewyorkmag.com. Share this story...

"amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> No Strings Attached amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << The Dilemma The Hammer >> No Strings Attached Boys and girls have been falling in love in romantic comedies ever since Harold Lloyd derailed his crushs wedding in Gun Shy. (Theyve been falling in love longer in the real world though the odds of a happy ending are halved.) What to do when the audience is certain of a happily-ever-after? In this tale of two fuck buddies director Ivan Reitman flips the script Adam (Ashton Kutcher) and Emmas (Natalie Portman) relationship kicks off at her dads funeral lurches into sex and ends with their first time holding hands. This is modern romance as agonized over by cultural critics like Ariel Levy the hand-wringing author of Female Chauvinist Pigs. At worst its the gateway to Sodom and Gomorrah. (You know if youre into that.) At best its the logical extension of this precocious practicality of a generation who prioritizes career and independence and compartmentalizes the vulnerable human heart. Writer Elizabeth Meriwether even gives Kutcher a monologue that links impersonal sex to the connected disconnect of texting and Facebook. Sure. But this is really a fantasy that seduces its audience women who want to pretend that theyre a brilliant med student with Ashton Kutcher at their beck and booty call and men whod love to get a text from Portman (or anyone really) that reads ""Your place 30 min."" The requirements of the central love story are simply two pairs of dreamy brown eyes and decent chemistry--neither Kutcher nor Portman register as anything as complicated as people. (Though theyve both spent years onPeoples Most Beautiful list.) But Reitmans crammed the movie with odd people and odd throwaway jokes Kevin Kline as the alpha dad who poaches Kutchers ex-girlfriend Lake Bell as his trainwreck boss on a Glee-esque show Greta Gerwig and Mindy Kaling as Portmans awkward roommates and even Cary Elwes in a near-silent role as a bearded inexplicably magnetic doctor. The shaggy fringes of the flick get most of the laughs--for one its absurdly obsessed with 90s hip-hop including a punch line where Ludacris waxes about a very special time listening to ""Who Let the Dogs Out?"" Scenes are shaped in situ with the looseness of improv; Reitmans forever cutting in at the tale end of a strange story leaving in random digressions or cutting away after a did-they-just-say-that murmur. And when Kutcher oversteps by making his girl a period-themed mixtape the joke keeps going cranking out a half-dozen song titles including ""Sunday Bloody Sunday."" By sheer force of will--or really willingness to wedge in a joke a minute--it works well enough that it wont crush Portmans chances at a Best Actress Oscar. Alas. But as Love Story argued love means never having to say youre sorry.

Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jan. 21 2011 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 241PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Directed by Hollywood veteran Ivan Reitman No Strings Attached is a romance with what its creators apparently believe is a daring contemporary twist In this instance its the woman who is the commitment-phobic idiot who is just in it for the sex. A lot of sharp lines from screenwriter Elizabeth Meriwether and a strong supporting cast are often enough to make that premise pleasant if not exactly shocking. Movies No Strings Attached The official trailer Celebrity The Wattage Meter How bright are these stars shining? Emma (Natalie Portman) is an overworked young medical resident who keeps bumping into Adam (Ashton Kutcher) a boy she once met at camp now an aspiring screenwriter overshadowed by his TV-star father. At one of these meetings during a drunken frat party some years before the main action begins Emma invites Adam to some ""thing"" she has to go to the next day which turns out to be her fathers funeral. She has behaved oddly and inappropriately yet he plays along sweetly and without complaint. And thats why when they do finally hook up and agree (at her insistence) that it will only be physical you know who it is who is going to break the pact and fall in love. There is no way in the world Mr. Twinkly Eyes and Soft Smiles is going to be the holdout here even if the winsome Portman fresh from the histrionic heights of Black Swan seems an unlikely candidate to be playing an emotionally incompetent medic too busy fixing bodies to feel for the humans inside them. Kutcher meanwhile is telegraphing incipient romance all over the place - I assume that is what Reitman believes is required in the role - although a bit more spine from the actor might have proven interesting. So its a flimsy premise - theres not exactly a lot of suspense as first great sex and then emotional complications ensue - but an intriguing one in that it relies entirely on psychology in a genre not known for complex motivations Portman just has to make us believe in Emmas block. Mainly she does that successfully crafting a character whose bluntness is wit whose coolness is energetic and whose hypercompetence is its own kind of life force. It is actually her final descent into heartbreak that rings false but by that point tired of the latest limp complication thrown up by the script youll be glad enough that the happy ending is now in sight youll probably forgive her. On the other hand as Adam Kutcher merely exudes charm whether seductive or injured and only starts acting in the few climactic scenes in which he abandons the puppy-dog look and manages his own bit of bitterness. Meanwhile Meriwethers slightly off-centre humour - Adam tells Emma she eats like a baby dinosaur; Adams rival a self-satisfied doctor says hell win Emma by ""using big words and saving lives"" - keeps things sufficiently unbalanced to make the comedy highly engaging. A lot of that success is thanks to an excellent supporting cast full of delightful character work Kevin Kline plays Adams insufferable dad; Ophelia Lovibond plays the outrageous ex-girlfriend who his dad then snags; Lake Bell plays the neurotically chatty colleague who pines for Adam; Jake Johnson plays his smart-ass best pal matched by Greta Gerwig bringing a light screwball touch to Emmas roommate. They all nicely round out the movie so that it need not rely exclusively on its stars or its plot. Woman overheard leaving the movie ""That was sooo cute"" Man overheard leaving the movie ""That was better than I expected."" The verdict is clear No Strings Attached is not half bad for a formulaic rom-com.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Consider a few of the intriguing connections attached to ""No Strings Attached"" the new romantic comedy starring Golden Globe winner Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher as a pair who start off with a plan to be sex buddies only to muck it up with feelings. Come summer another movie about two people embarking on a strictly casual sex relationship is set to open. Its called ""Friends With Benefits"" a phrase by the way that appears in the dialogue of ""No Strings Attached."" ""Friends"" stars Mila Kunis who happens to be the earthy beauty who plays the ballerina Portmans character fears will clip her wings in ""Black Swan."" Kunis first came to pop-culture consciousness on the Fox sitcom ""That 70s Show."" Just like Kutcher. As the kids like to text ""OMG"" ""Friends With Benefits"" also stars Justin Timberlake. He became famous as a member of the boy band N Sync. The name of its biggest selling album? ""No Strings Attached."" Get out Its a little like those Kennedy-Lincoln assassination coincidences only a lot less eerie. Perhaps Hollywood writers should take to talking at cafes and restaurants holding a sheet of paper over their mouths like NFL coaches do. Were just sayin. Granted this list has very little to do with what happens on screen in ""No Strings Attached."" But then it was more fun compiling it than watching Emma Kurtzman (Portman) and Adam Franklin (Kutcher) maneuver their way toward the inevitable. They first meet at a camp. Years later Emma is an intern at a teaching hospital. Adam the son of a one-time TV sensation (played by Kevin Kline) works on a TV series set in a high school. Its hard not to see this as a bit of ""Glee"" exploitation a form of shoring up weak material with something truly superior. The twist Adam is the one ready to declare his major feelings. For reasons glancingly handled Emma wants to keep their attraction knot-free. Its not that the leads arent affable. They are. Its not that they arent nice to look at. They are. (Although the cinematography makes them look sort of blotchy.) Its just hard to care if they hook up after they well hook up. Directed by veteran comedy guy Ivan Reitman ""No Strings"" reminds us that these days the romantic comedys mandate is a tricky one Stoke the softer fantasies of being smitten while teasing more frank views on sex. How to mix the old-fashioned with the thoroughly modern? How do you deliver the hearts and chocolates along with the booty calls in one love story? Those are questions a few films answer well -- ""Love amp; Other Drugs"" most recently. ""No Strings Attached""? Well it got tangled in the quandary. ""NO STRINGS ATTACHED."" R for language and brief nudity. 1 hour 48 minutes. Directed by Ivan Reitman; written by Elizabeth Meriwether; from a story by Mike Samonek and Meriwether. Photography by Rogier Stoffers.

Unwinding enough to pull off this relaxed raunchy romantic comedy may be her toughest challenge yet By Richard Corliss Jan. 21 2011 Share Read Later Dale Robinette / Paramount Pictures Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture On Feb. 27 Oscar night Natalie Portman will likely be proclaimed the years best actress for her performance as the obsessive ballerina in Black Swan. One reason for this expected accolade is that she plays against type -- the Natalie Portman type -- by boldly renouncing the ladylike propriety that has marked many of her roles and that she wears like a princesss tiara in her private-public life. Nice girl plays naughty girl; brava Another reason is that as everyone whos read about the film knows director Darren Aronofsky insisted she practice for six arduous months to become a plausible dancer. The Motion Picture Academy likes to know you worked like a demon to nail the role. Thats a prime requisite of these awards actors get them when they make their job look hard. But theres Acting in serioso psycho-thrillers like Black Swan and then theres slipping into the lead role in a romantic comedy like Portmans new film No Strings Attached. Its the difference between pretending to be someone else and pretending to be yourself. That used to be called star acting and in this movie the master of that underappreciated craft is Ashton Kutcher. A former Calvin Klein model and That 70s Show ingenue Kutcher knows that the key to rom-com is relaxation the old movie magic of an easy warmth kindled by two stars. You dont put yourself through boot camp; instead you take it easy or seem to and trust in your radiance. Its a game of seduction with your co-star and the audience as the seducees. Kutcher makes his job look like no job at all. And that ladies and gentlemen is acting. (VIDEO Watch TIMEs 10 Questions for Natalie Portman.) Written by 20-something Elizabeth Meriwether and directed by 64-year-old Ivan Reitman (Jasons father) No Strings Attached has a cross-generational vibe its a Rock Hudson-Doris Day movie with penis jokes. Adam (Kutcher) is an assistant on a Glee-ish TV show; hes known Nina (Portman) off and on for half their lives. A young med student Nina is too serious for a serious relationship. So she offers a deal to Adam that they ""use each other for sex at all hours of the day or night and nothing else."" No dates; no nicknames for body parts; and the one forbidden four-letter word is love. Adam is game and who wouldnt be? Shes Natalie Portman. But soon hes behaving the way a courtly boyfriend would making her a mix tape of classic pop songs (when she has her period) and slipping into the spooning position as they sleep after sex. Dammit hes falling in love with her -- because shes Natalie Portman. He takes her on a real date one so faux-innocent (miniature golf a museum visit a soda-shoppe interlude to consume a milkshake with two straws) that the mood is pre-Rock and Doris; its Andy Hardy and Polly Benedict in MGMs wholesome sentimental renditions of the American teen dream. (See pictures of Natalie Portmans career.) Aiming to be a smart comedy that stupid folks can enjoy too the movie sometimes footnotes its own gags -- as when a friend tells Adam ""The thing about having sex in a Prius is that you dont have to feel guilty afterward"" and Kutcher immediately explains joke to the eco-ignorant members of the audience ""Because of the low carbon footprint."" The picture is no great shakes as cinema and a shade too cute for its own good. Still its a mild shock to see a competent film released in the January trough. Better than that No Strings is a relative rarity an R-rated rom-com where the two stars exchange the sweet or prickly intimacies that real people talk about before during and after sex. And not guy-guy -- as in the standard bromance smirking with the towel snap of locker-room wisdom -- but guy-gal in all appropriate gender shadings. Credit that to a woman screenwriters variation on the Judd Apatow ethic; and take note Hollywood that a few raunchy endearments can give a rom-com gender equality. This is a genre well outside Portmans comfort zone which is normally embodying tense highly wired characters. In her lifetime before the camera (starting when she was 12 as a waif adopted by a gunman in Luc Bessons The Professional) she has mostly played fraught heroines whether in big-budget action films or soulful domestic dramas. Here she seems uncomfortable at first an exchange student at a frat party. Remember how Marilyn Monroe spoke English -- almost as a second language that she had crammed to learn? Thats how Portman approaches her first Hollywood comedy. The Harvard girl has a tough new course and it takes her about half of the film to get it right. Give Portman her due. Along the way she takes pointers in behavioral acting from the rest of the cast (including Kevin Kline Olivia Thirlby and Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) and wills herself into relaxation mode. By the end when Nina finally falls in love with Adam the donut powder on her nose doesnt seem like an indignity a hazing of the Euro-star but the most adorable accessory. Portman will win no Oscar or critics prize for this movie but if its a hit she may convince Hollywood to make room for her beside Anne Hathaway Katherine Heigl and the other foxy ladies of rom-com. And if somebody gave an award in the undervalued category of lighting up a movie just by showing up and seeming to be himself the winner would be Ashton Kutcher.

"No Strings Attached reivew Romantic comedy puts new spin on date-movie traditions |       NJ.com comments No Strings Attached reivew Romantic comedy puts new spin on date-movie traditions Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 21 2011 at 746 AM View/Post Comments UNTITLED IVAN REITMAN PROJECT Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher turn up the charm in the new ""No Strings Attached."" In the old days romantic comedies started with two people falling in love -- and ended with the first discreet hint of them falling into bed. ""No Strings Attached"" deliberately gets that backward. In its plot-reversed (and gender-bent) story Natalie Portman is the super-smart incredibly overworked doctor who doesnt have time for romance and only wants quick zipless sex. Ashton Kutcher is the beautiful sensitive writer whos been hurt badly and wants someone he can talk to in bed and even have a nice pancake breakfast with the next morning. So of course they hook up. And of course things get complicated. Movie Review No Strings Attached (R) Paramount (108 min.) Directed by Ivan Reitman. With Natalie Portman Ashton Kutcher. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains nudity sexual situations strong language comic violence and substance abuse. Stephen Whittys Review THREE STARS Things dont however -- thankfully -- get stupid. Brightly written by young Elizabeth Meriwether (who gets the new text n sex culture absolutely right) and directed with some flair by Canadian comedy patriarch Ivan Reitman ""No Strings Attached"" is the first fun date movie of the year. The first fun movie actually. It doesnt get off to a great start. Theres a crude (and crudely repeated) line early on as if the films rushing to announce its own rowdiness. Actually the entire first 15 minutes feel a bit rushed. Characters are introduced so quickly their relationships are confusing. Portmans relationship-phobia doesnt get much back story and feels a lot like a mere plot device. But both young stars are charming (its probably Portmans warmest turn since ""Garden State"" and Kutchers most affable work ever). And Reitmans assembled a terrific supporting cast any one of whom could carry their own romantic comedy. Kevin Kline as Kutchers randy TV-star dad? Wittily wonderful. The perpetually underused Lake Bell as Kutchers blindly adoring co-worker? Warmly geeky-sexy. Greta Gerwig Mindy Kaling and even Ludacris all show up and add their own twists on things while still serving the material. Sometimes the script overdoes things a bit. At times Kutcher is so understanding it feels as if he should be lying on the front stoop with ""Welcome"" tattooed on his chest. And Portmans dont-you-dare-fall-in-love-with-me act can seem forced. (At least when Anne Hathaway set the emotional limits in ""Love amp; Other Drugs"" she had a good and selfless reason.) But everything still works out nicely at the end. And while the denouement treads closely to the cliched -- it involves Im sorry to say pretty much the same please-forgive-me ending as every romantic comedy of the last 15 years -- it still fades out on a nice understated last line. And by the way stick around for the final credits. Reitman has a few good jokes saved up for them -- and judging by this the director of ""Dave"" ""Ghostbusters"" and ""Stripes"" still has a few good comedies left in his big bag of tricks.

Photo (c)Paramount/Courtesy Everett Coll Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman in ""No Strings Attached."" (AP) Natalie Portman who will almost certainly be Oscar-nominated next week for her tour de force as a demented ballerina in ""Black Swan"" does her best with a problematic script and a largely unresponsive co-star in Ivan Reitmans fitfully amusing sex comedy ""No Strings Attached."" Known as ""Friends With Benefits"" until an upcoming Justin Timberlake-Mila Kunis film successfully laid claim to that title Reitmans comedy casts Portman as Emma a commitment-phobic medical intern who opts for a strictly-for-sex relationship with Adam (Ashton Kutcher) a casual acquaintance of 15 years whos a production assistant on a TV series resembling ""Glee."" Adam of course cant stop himself from falling in love with Emma. PHOTOS ASHTON KUTCHERS LEADING LADIES Any hopes that ""No Strings Attached"" might turn romantic-comedy cliches on their head by reversing the usual sex roles are soon dashed however. The movie quickly sinks into a terminal case of the cutes and extreme predictability -- amid the usual surfeit of wacky supporting characters. One of the reasons ""The Social Network"" was so refreshing is that it didnt resort to the very tired device of presenting the heros parents to explain his behavior. This comedy by contrast offers a contrived only-in-Southern California reason for Adam to go texting for a ""sex friend"" -- his dad a famous and fatuous sitcom star (Kevin Kline in a cringe-worthy turn) is sleeping with Adams ex-girlfriend. Kutchers approach to romantic comedy hasnt much evolved since he made ""Just Married"" eight years ago with his late then-girlfriend Brittany Murphy -- he shows off his buff bod at every opportunity and bats his eyelashes while mooning at his leading lady. Its not exactly the edgier approach initially promised in the script attributed to playwright Elizabeth Meriwether. He doesnt really have any chemistry with Portman though she works awfully hard at the sisyphean task of making their way too tastefully staged couplings look hot. She also has to deliver such blunt dialogue as ""You have a really nice penis"" ""Its the best sex of my life"" and worse. The crudity reaches a low point during Emmas menstrual period when Adam presents her with a mix tape that includes the Frank Sinatra classic ""Ive Got the World on a String."" These are the laughs in ""No Strings Attached"" which squanders such talents as mumblecore darling Greta Gerwig (""Greenberg"") in a tiny role as Emmas lesbian-leaning roommate. Lake Bell plays the secretly infatuated workaholic boss who encourages Adams writing ambitions and is rewarded with an especially humiliating scene. Veteran Cary Elwes as Emmas boss seems to have most of his part left on the cutting-room floor and Olivia Thirlby (""Juno"") doesnt fare much better as her sister. While director Reitman (""Ghostbusters"") scores laughs with a comic bit here and there ""No Stings Attached"" largely leaves the talented Portman single-handedly trying to squeeze blood from a stone. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next MTVs new show Skins under fire for potential child porn...

ABOUT THE MOVIENo Strings Attached  1/2 out of four Stars Natalie Portman Ashton Kutcher Kevin Kline Lake Bell Greta Gerwig Cary ElwesDirector Ivan ReitmanDistributor Paramount ?PicturesRating R for sexual content language and some drug materialRunning time 1 hour 50 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Its no surprise that friends with benefits can bleed into romantic couplings. Whats more surprising is that while dramas strive for authenticity and a sense of credibility romantic movie comedies rarely do. Filmmakers may assume audiences prefer that their rom-coms follow a predictable path. Whatever the reason its the rare mainstream romantic comedy that is amusing believable or even romantic. No Strings Attached is by no means the worst of the lot falling squarely in the middle. There are humorous moments and its a bit less bland than its contemporaries. INTERVIEW Portman Kutcher talk it up And theres chemistry between leads Natalie Portman who plays Emma a driven medical student and Ashton Kutcher as Adam a production assistant on a Glee-like TV show. Emma professes to be too busy for a relationship and no good at them. So she calls upon longtime pal Adam to be her partner for sexual romps insisting they check their emotions at the bedroom door. They get along famously have a great time in bed and are easy on the eyes. It doesnt take advanced calculus to figure out that at least one of the pair will fall for the other and want a more committed relationship. This friends-with-benefits scenario has been explored in various permutations from Knocked Up to Hes Just Not That Into You and will be mined again this summer with Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis in the aptly if unimaginatively titled Friends With Benefits. Portman just won a best-actress Golden Globe for her role in the psycho-drama Black Swan. And while drama is her forte she holds her own in this lighter fare. Comedy veteran Kutcher is like an eager puppy with less personality. In fact hes reminiscent of the likable pup Dug in Up when he enthusiastically burbles ""I like you"" to Portman at a party. Hes not given anything too interesting to say but he looks cute saying it. Hes endearing as he hands her a bunch of carrots instead of roses on Valentines Day and shows up at her apartment at a critical moment with cupcakes and an unusually creative mix tape. Its genial supporting cast is a plus particularly Lake Bell as Adams overtalking producer boss and Kevin Kline as Adams former TV star dad. Veteran director Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters) seems to be moving away from high-concept comedies to more intimate fare. It would seem to be the right move after his last film 2007s lamentable My Super Ex-Girlfriend. But his son Jason (Up in the Air Juno) might have approached this story with more edgy wit. The few genuinely comic moments and deviations from cutesy rom-com formula make you wish No Strings Attached had traveled a more distinctively offbeat path.

"Crude spoils mood in No Strings Attached - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-FilmMOVIE REVIEW  FILM CRITIC Crude spoils mood in No Strings AttachedDirector Ivan Reitman lets the raunchiness poison his films rom-com heart.January 21 2011|BETSY SHARKEY Of course there are strings attached in Ivan Reitmans new romantic comedy ""No Strings Attached"" starring Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher as best sex buddies. With a role-reversing twist -- its the girl avoiding commitment and the guy hoping for love -- the film had possibilities. Sadly an obsession with raunchy one-liners trips everything up turning a clever conceit into something closer to a sleazy cheesy affair.Though the bad jokes are a lot of what sours the film Im not laying blame solely at the feet of screenwriter Elizabeth Meriwether because the result reeks of intervention. Tampering perhaps by studio suits worried that the movies strong female/sentimental male might not bring in bubbas without pumping it full of racier stuff; or worse a veteran director (that would be ""Ghostbusting"" Reitman) trying to prove he can still hang with the cool kids. (Since Reitman has said he was inspired to return to directing by son Jasons smart relationship comedy ""Up in the Air"" he should take a few lessons from the kid on classing-up a project).Now raunch properly used isnt a problem per se. But creating and cultivating rich crude is an art form one typically achieved by the perfect melding of off-color riffs and internal logic. That doesnt happen in ""No Strings"" where the bits sound like they were cribbed from bathroom stall scribes and the dialogue doesnt wear well on characters who seem to actually have some soul and substance.The stage is set 15 years in the past during a summer-camp encounter between the gawky teens who will grow up to be Emma (Portman) and Adam (Kutcher). They meet funny-sweet Hes been shipped to camp because his folks are divorcing; shes sympathetic. But things go south with Adams crass attempt to bust a move. Suffice it to say if this were football rather than flirting the penalty flags would be flying.After a brief hi-bye a few years later at a college frat party and an afternoon date that turns out to be her fathers funeral  the film settles into present day where Emma and Adam again bump into each other this time at an L.A. farmers market. In the intervening years they have become adults with careers surrounded by the requisite clique of funny friends and dealing with -- how else to put this? -- unmet needs. Girlfriend woes and a drinking binge eventually land Adam in Emmas bed where a deal is struck sex without entanglements. Like that ever works.The arena is upscale and full of type-A yuppies. Portmans Emma is a medical resident -- brainy beautiful busy -- and yet somehow able to squeeze in a quickie every few scenes. The actress does her best giving Emma warmth and sass which suggests that with the right material Portmans seriously funny side might surprise you. The sex most of which she initiates is quite athletic and energetic but this will not be the performance that Portman is remembered for (though it does make for some interesting coupling comparisons coming as it does amid the Oscar push for ""Black Swan"").Kutcher has no such comparative worries. His Adam is a TV show assistant with a famous father (Kevin Klein as a popular former sitcom star churning through a series of trophy wives in sort of a Kelsey Grammer impersonation). Adam is pretty much a carbon copy of the goofball charmer Kutchers been playing since ""That 70s Show"" hit Fox in 1998 which is sweet on the surface just not very deep.Reitman struck gold in the 80s with ""Ghostbusters"" and ""Stripes"" but its been a long time since hes found magic in the directors chair (which is different from money). Still he has done this gig enough times to ensure a certain polish that keeps things moving along and looking good and hes helped by an experienced team that includes cinematographer Rogier Stoffers production designer Ida Random costume designer Julie Weiss and editor Dana Glauberman.There are moments of redemption -- when Emma and Adam try to get a handle on what a real relationship might require ""No Strings Attached"" gets better. Ultimately the film poses an intriguing question Can great sex lead to true love? Its just by the time they get around to answering it you probably wont care.--betsy.sharkeylatimes.com--No Strings AttachedMPAA rating R for sexual content language and some drug materialRunning time 1 hour50 minutesPlaying In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMovie review Our Idiot BrotherAugust 26 2011Movie Review  Legal Eagles Loses Its Entertainment CaseJune 18 1986MORE STORIES ABOUTFilmNo Strings Attached (movie)Farmers MarketCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-no-strings-attached-20110121,0,1896063.story",200,nostringsattached13,nostringsattached,latimes

Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher star in ""No Strings Attached."" Photo Dale Robinette Paramount Pictures No Strings Attached review New lay of the land 1 / 2 Back to Gallery The harsh and frank coarseness that has become a part of screen comedy in recent years is spilling over into romantic comedy. Let it spill If todays new harshness keeps romantic comedies honest - keeps them speaking the language of their time showing how people think and talk and behave around the whole subject of love - that can only be a good thing. And ""No Strings Attached"" does that almost. It takes a gimmicky premise about two people who try to have a purely sexual relationship and then fulfills it without distorting or bending the characters around a formula. In fact the movie is just good enough to make us want more and to understand whats missing. What it lacks is a certain depth not character detail but character insight - an extra something that might have allowed us to believe were actually seeing humanity onscreen rather than the mere and not-unpleasant spectacle of Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher trying to give each other a root canal with their tongues. So think of ""No Strings"" as a so-so example of a really positive trend which automatically makes it a little better than so-so. Emma and Adam dont meet cute. They meet when they are 14 at camp when theyre too young to be played by Portman and Kutcher. Already shes a little remote; hes a little vulnerable. They meet again over the years as adults and theres a connection between them. Then one day when theyre around 30 - when shes a resident in medicine and hes on the crew of a TV show - circumstances throw them together and they have sex. And they like it. The audience likes it too. Its good for all concerned. Related Stories No Strings Attached But Emma doesnt believe in relationships or at least shes afraid of them. Plus shes pulling long shifts at the hospital and hes not dumb enough to ask for what she doesnt want to give. So when she proposes that they just have sex all the time while agreeing not to get emotionally involved he says yes without more than a milliseconds deliberation. How that works out is the story of the movie. ""No Strings Attached"" could have been fluffy nonsense about two airheads who gradually discover deeper feelings. But from the beginning Adam likes Emma and would like a more traditional relationship. And Emma is not some shallow manipulator. Shes funny self-possessed and high-functioning and of course she has Natalie Portmans smile the all-knowing smile of a shrewd intelligence. Portman makes Emmas resistance to feeling interesting like theres a story there - not a reason not an explanation but a depth to be explored. She takes Emma as far as the script allows but she cant inhabit what isnt there and so ""No Strings Attached"" stays at a certain level and doesnt go beyond that. Which is to say it remains an enjoyable romantic comedy for people who happen to like romantic comedies. Others who dont like them generically who only enjoy the best examples of the form will be less enthralled. By the way why do people make fun of Ashton Kutcher and say he cant act? I wouldnt necessarily suggest him for say Geoffrey Rushs role in ""The Kings Speech"" but within his sphere hes an engaging relaxed seemingly sincere tall pleasant-looking guy who when called upon can look as if hes in love or in lust or both. He has never given a bad performance. Hes never been less than an asset to every movie hes in and that includes this one. -- Advisory Simulated sex nudity strong language.

Hes a little smug whether hes shilling for Nikon or popping up in a romantic comedy. He makes everything look easy and hes managed to make himself ubiquitous in todays pop culture. In the better-than-youd-think No Strings Attached he tries on a role that fits rather nicely the affable wounded lover not entirely sure what hes gotten himself into and yes kind of likable.Strings is the latest in whats becoming a series of post-romantic comedies about couples who want sex but not the emotional complications that come with a full-on relationship (last years Love and Other Drugs the upcoming Friends With Benefits). Humiliated when his ex-girlfriend connects with his TV honcho dad (a sly Kevin Kline) Kutchers Adam seeks solace with a doctor friend played by Natalie Portman. In an interesting twist its the woman here who doesnt want to commit; Emma likens her intimacy phobia to ""an emotional peanut allergy"" and so the two try to keep it strictly in the bedroom (and in the closet and on the floor -- you get the idea).Directed by old pro Ivan Reitman from a screenplay by Elizabeth Meriwether No Strings has good fun with the awkwardness that follows Adam and Emmas first unplanned encounter. Unsure how to proceed he visits her at work with a balloon that reads ""Congrats"" (""You did a good job"" he explains sheepishly). A friends response ""You brought her a balloon? Who do you think you are the old guy from Up?"" Theres plenty of Apatow-like banter here seemingly a must in these days of hipster ensemble comedy.Theres a also a frisky sense of nowness and even when Adam and Emma stalemate into narrative inertia stopping and starting through those ever-messy emotions that can come after sex an assortment of appealing bit players keeps things humming along. In Emmas corner The Offices Mindy Kaling as a wry fellow doctor and Olivia Thirlby as the younger sister. With Adam The rapper Ludacris who shows off a quiet sense of comic timing and Lake Bell who steals many scenes as a nervous chatterbox of a TV director.You can see where No Strings Attached is heading before it gets there but its still a pleasant enough and surprisingly romantic ride. Portman in particular seems to be enjoying herself After the repressed and psychotic passions of Black Swan she launches herself into the comic role of a liberated woman trying to define her freedom to frolic. Its not easy out there the movie suggests even when the star-crossed stars manage to keep those inconvenient feelings light and frothy.Follow Chris Vognar on Twitter chrisvognar.R (sexual content language brief nudity drugs).

"Movie review Casual sex explored in No Strings Attached | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesMovie review Casual sex explored in No Strings AttachedCan two good-looking people make love without falling in love? No silly of course they cant.Ashton Kutcher left and Natalie Portman make cute in No Strings Attached.  (Dale Robinette / AP)  By Bruce DeMaraThu. Jan. 20 2011 No Strings Attached (out of 4) Starring Natalie Portman Ashton Kutcher and Kevin Kline. Directed by Ivan Reitman. 103 minutes. At major theatres. 14A Emma (Natalie Portman) is a doctor in residency looking for sex with no complications determined not to end up with a broken heart and a bunch of her exs old T-shirts. Adam (Ashton Kutcher) is a happy-go-lucky dude fresh out of a bad relationship whos content to score when Emmas schedule permits. Can two good-looking people make love without falling in love? No silly of course they cant. This may be the 2lst century but love and sex or sex and then love remain as firmly entwined as bacon and eggs rice and beans or fish and chips. What elevates No Strings Attached above the average (usually awful) romantic comedy is a decent script the sure hand of veteran director Ivan Reitman and the likeable performances of stars Portman and Kutcher. The script by Elizabeth Meriwether is unabashedly naughty liberally laced with swear words casual drug use and unsentimental horniness. Thats a very good thing coming out of the Hollywood dream machine where too often an undercurrent of old-fashioned American prudery tends to blight the fun. The story starts at summer camp with two awkward teens sitting side by side the boy lamenting his celebrity fathers impending divorce the girl awkwardly trying to comfort him as he cries. ""People arent meant to be together forever"" young Emma sagely pronounces. ""Can I finger you?"" Adam then asks hopefully only to be briskly shot down. Five years later after meeting again at a frat party Emma takes Adam to her fathers funeral the next day where he stands out like a sore thumb. ""If youre lucky youre never going to see me again"" she tells him solemnly. Four years later they meet again by chance he with girlfriend in tow. Third time lucky? Nope. Portman is of course the real deal onscreen a genuine thespian who effortlessly breathes life into the role of Emma who as her sister notes is ""too good at being alone."" But its Kutcher who proves to be better than expected exhibiting something beyond the puppy-dog charm with both solid comic timing and pathos. Theres also some great supporting work from the cast including Lake Bell as Lucy a co-worker of Adams and Jake M. Johnson as Adams pal Eli. Not everything works completely including the somewhat awkward relationship between Adam and his dad Alvin played by the always reliable Kevin Kline. And what is Cary Elwes doing there hiding behind a beard long hair and glasses as a doctor whose very few moments of screen time and dialogue contribute nothing to the story? But as the picture wends on (and lets face it we know where its going) there are plenty of moments of brash hilarity -- to wit Adams compilation of a ""period mix"" CD featuring songs about menstruation -- some great tunes and a conclusion that while entirely predictable still wields some emotional power. Oh and you get to see Kutchers bare bum. (Not that big a deal.)

By Joe Morgenstern Updated Jan. 21 2011 1201 a.m. ET The prospect was iffy at best a romantic comedy from a Hollywood studio with a premise that smacked of ""Last Tango in Paris"" the scandalous classic in which Marlon Brando and Maria Schneider have a sexual liaison with no strings--or names--attached. Yet the outcome is delightful. Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman are the lovers in ""No Strings Attached"" which Ivan Reitman directed with great verve and unflagging finesse from a terrifically funny script by Elizabeth Meriwether. These lovers do have names Adam and Emma. Theyre longtime friends who decide to become FWBs--friends with benefits i.e. sex friends--because they dont think they can handle the demands of a committed relationship without wrecking their cherished friendship. In fact its more complicated than that and much more interesting but their earnest entry into a no-strings pact is enough to put them on a bumpy raunchy--sometimes very raunchy--and pot-holed road to true love. ENLARGE Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman in No Strings Attached. Paramount Pictures Adam is an aspiring writer on a cheerfully silly TV show about high schoolers ""who sing dance and blog."" Emma is a doctor which is why she tells him at one point ""You give me premature ventricular contractions--my heart skips a beat."" The movie doesnt miss a beat be it comical farcical emotional or even lyrical. (Well maybe one--a change of heart announced by Emma in the courtyard of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art that seems to have happened off camera.) This success is due in huge part to the beautifully tuned work of its co-stars to the lilt of their verbal--and yes physical--duets. Both of the actors like their characters seem to be enjoying themselves with a graceful sense of self-irony that inoculates them against narcissism. Mr. Kutchers Adam is an intelligent good-hearted hunk whos genuinely lovable. Ms. Portmans Emma has a gift for floating and darting while staying grounded. Still actors cant do what these two do without gifted people around them. The director Mr. Reitman (thats Reitman pere of ""Ghost Busters"" not Reitman fils of ""Up in the Air"") sustains precise and often delicate comic rhythms yet he also allows for enjoyable looseness in scenes that can use it. (Some of my favorites involve a special musical mix that Adam burns for Emma a congratulatory balloon that he brings for her and an interlude on a miniature golf course.) The writer Ms. Meriwether (no grounds for confusion here; its her feature-film debut) keeps the zingers coming with remarkable regularity and almost eerie accuracy. More than that though she has created a heroine with substantial if unstressed depth. Far from a flirty beauty who wants to keep her options open Emma keeps her distance from open feelings because she hasnt learned how to do otherwise. ""Im not an affectionate person"" she says in a girlhood prologue. Thats before she blossoms forth as Natalie Portman but even then Emma knows herself all too well. In keeping with the quality at the top of the bill the supporting cast is chockablock with comic chops Kevin Kline as Adams father Alvin a fatuously lascivious actor whos famous mainly for saying ""Great Scott""; Greta Gerwig as Emmas quick-witted friend Patrice; Lake Bells Lucy a major-league neurotic producing minor-league TV; Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges as Adams cheerfully profane and dependably obtuse friend Wallace. ""No Strings Attached"" doesnt have the overexposed washed-out look of a studio comedy--the cinematographer was Rogier Stoffers--and doesnt for a moment feel like one. Its a smart sexy romcom that turns the neat trick of staying sweetly human. The Way Back Watch a clip from the film The Way Back starring Ed Harris and Colin Farrell. Peter Weirs latest film (he directed ""Master and Commander"" ""The Truman Show"" and ""Gallipoli"" among many others) takes us--on foot--from a Siberian gulag in 1940 to India by way of Siberian wastes to the south then much more Siberia east of Lake Baikal Mongolia and finally the Himalayas and Tibet. The journeys length is reflected in its visual sweep and unfortunately in its pace and its 133-minute running time. ""The Way Back"" was inspired by the Slavomir Rawicz novel ""The Long Walk The True Story of a Trek to Freedom."" How much the books truth was embellished by fiction continues to be a subject of debate. Yet theres cumulative power in the tale part prison break and part survival epic of a group of political prisoners led by a young Polish cavalry officer Janusz (Jim Sturgess) who escape from their Soviet captors only to suffer dreadful hardships in a year-long quest for freedom. ENLARGE Saiorse Ronan foreground in The Way Back. Newmarket Films Most of those hardships are familiar to movie lovers; thats a reductionist view of a serious and ambitious production but it is after all a movie on a screen. (And a movie with a dreadfully clumsy ending.) How many new ways can you dramatize icy gales parched deserts agonizing thirst shimmering mirages? And how do you step up the pace of a story thats about people walking? It helps when some Mongolian horsemen come galloping out of nowhere. It also helps to think that real people may have achieved this but that nagging question is how real they were. The movies most interesting element is the civilizing effect of a young woman Irena (Saoirse Ronan) who joins the group partway through their journey or if you will their pilgrimage. Irena is the one who incites her male companions to kindness and who elicits touching stories that help them learn about one another. (Shes an equally useful device for the director and Keith Clarke. They wrote the screenplay which is generally sparse on characterization as opposed to behavioral characteristics.) Russell Boyd did the spectacular cinematography. The admirable cast includes Ed Harris and Colin Farrell who sports flamboyant side-by-side tattoos of Lenin and Stalin on his chest. Summer Wars Watch a clip from the Japanese animated film Summer Wars. The official Japanese entry for an animated-feature Oscar ""Summer Wars"" enlivens second- or third-rate storytelling with patches of first-rate animation. The dubbed English dialogue is awful--the acting and writing not the accents--while the plot is an unmanageable melange of domestic drama plus cyber attack impending apocalypse flashy avatars immersive video games and artificial intelligence running amok. The teenage hero Kenji is both a math genius and a generic nerd who lives for and mostly in an online community called Oz. (Imagine ""Dungeons amp; Dragons"" crossed with ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers."") Hes invited by a pretty girl just like that to spend a few days at her ancestral home impersonating her fiance for the benefit of her dying grandmother. Then just like that Kenji is called upon to save the world when a rogue program called Love Machine acquires an orbiting nuclear weapon. ENLARGE A scene from Summer Wars GKIDS/Summer Wars Film Partners Japans abiding fear of nuclear weapons continues to inform its popular culture so its not surprising to find that element surfacing yet again in this storyline. Still I found ""Summer Wars"" scary on very different grounds--as an unwitting example of the mindset its depicting. The script takes a mildly satiric stance toward a new world order in which the disjointed abstractions of online life have pretty much replaced the traditions of social interaction. Whats scary is how disjointed the movie itself proves to be. Its as if the people who made it were determined to confirm our fears of what computers are doing to kids minds. The filmmakers cant keep the strands of their clumsy plot straight but they create brilliant images and manipulate them with blithe abandon. Oz is a vastness of white space that teems with toylike objects teraflopping monsters and gladiatorial avatars that owe more to Aztec esthetics than to the glum denizens of ""Tron."" A vision like this could make you want to stop making sense. DVD FOCUS Beautiful Girls (1996) ENLARGE Beautiful Girls French Kiss and Greenberg Natalie Portman is sensational as Marty a hyperverbal nymphet in this comedy that the late Ted Demme directed from Scott Rosenbergs original screenplay. ""Clearly Ms. Portman is en route to stardom"" I wrote in my review; ""she steals this picture from a large and talented cast."" The picture centers on blue-collar buddies who are thwarted in work as well as love; theyre off to the side of the information highway plowing driveways for a living in the dead of winter. The cast includes Matt Dillon Lauren Holly Timothy Hutton Rosie ODonnell Michael Rappaport Mira Sorvino and Uma Thurman. French Kiss (1995) Kevin Kline does a parody of French cliches as Luc a Gallic con man in this Lawrence Kasdan farce. Meg Ryan is the sorely tried Kate who flies to Paris in pursuit of her wayward fiance. This sort of film is sometimes likened to a souffle--whether risen or fallen will depend on your feelings about Ms. Ryans recipe for pert. Mr. Klines performance turns on elated virtuosity. He gets laughs just by pronouncing his characters name. The uninspired plot turns on a stolen necklace that Luc plants in Kates handbag to get it through customs. Greenberg (2010) Greta Gerwig gives a portrayal of heartbreaking delicacy as Florence Marr the wistful young heroine of Noah Baumbachs remarkable comedy. ""Ive gotta stop doing things just because they feel good"" Florence says although theres no evidence she feels truly good about anything. She feels properly anxious about an emerging love affair with Roger Greenberg a middle-aging misanthrope played with intransigent brilliance by Ben Stiller. Still Florence is joyous compared to Roger whose anger is matched only by his narcissism. ""Greenberg"" scintillates with intelligence razors-edge humor and austere empathy for its struggling lovers. --Joe Morgenstern Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday January 20 2011 413 PM Title No Strings Attached Romantic comedy about friends with benefits. With Natalie Portman Ashton Kutcher. Director Ivan Reitman (150). R Sex language. At area theaters.With a Golden Globe behind her a baby on the way and an Oscar nomination around the corner its fair to say that Natalie Portmans already having a very good year.Alas into each life a little rain must fall. And Portmans current storm cloud is called ""No Strings Attached.""On the bright side Ivan Reitmans disappointing new comedy isnt just cheap and formulaic but so forgettable few people will even remember she was in it.In a rushed and nonsensical prologue we learn that Portmans Emma and Ashton Kutchers Adam started bonding way back in camp. Years later a drunk and heartbroken Adam ends up crying on her couch after learning that his ex (Ophelia Lovibond) is now dating his dad (Kevin Kline).Lonely and unhappy herself Emma suggests that she and Adam add some benefits to their platonic friendship. So for a while they take extra-long lunches text each other at 2 a.m. and make creative use of public rest rooms.But of course things get complicated when Adam pushes for a more serious relationship.While any normal person would either agree or break up the commitment-phobic Emma begins behaving as rom-com heroines so frequently do like a lunatic. Right around the time she winds up spying on him from the bushes she realizes that something is wrong with this picture.And is there ever. Then again Elizabeth Meriwethers script relies on so many crass double entendres lazy jokes and easy cliches perhaps its only appropriate that Reitman barely rouses himself to provide direction.The only saving grace is an impressive collection of co-stars -- including Greta Gerwig Lake Bell Mindy Kaling Jake Johnson and Olivia Thirlby -- who bring far more enthusiasm than required.As for the leads neither is able to inject much humanity into characters who bear so little resemblance to actual people.Portman will get past this speed bump with well-earned swiftness. The affable Kutcher however seems stuck in a cycle of depressingly empty comedies. If he ever wants to be taken seriously he should probably remember that easy paychecks usually come with strings attached.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

They meet as teenagers at summer camp and in the intervening 15 years their paths cross at decisive moments. By 30 both are in Los Angeles. Adam an aspiring scriptwriter works as a production assistant on a TV show like Glee. Emma a physician works 80-hour weeks as a medical resident.They hook up one hungover morning after Adam has texted every female among his cell-phone contacts to help him through the night. Because Emma has such a demanding schedule she asks Adam to be her friend-with-benefits.The uproarious script offers a brief glimpse of their work lives and also of the primal relationships that have stamped them. Adams dad a self-infatuated TV star and Casanova (Kevin Kline quite amusing) influences Adams rebellion to the degree that the son values feelings over sex. Emmas dad dies when she is at college and she self-protects by becoming unemotional; she wont let another man get close enough that he might trigger grief or fear of abandonment. Sex is a safe place to compartmentalize her feelings.Kutcher and Portman have terrific screen physics using their 12-inch height difference to considerable slapstick effect. He is a galumphing hulk who comes to heel when the munchkin barks at him. Do they have chemistry? Not exactly. But both are such gorgeous animals that their couplings are frisky fun without being sexually explicit.With laser rather than scalpel Meriwethers script dissects dating in the post-courtship era. Professionally driven Emma and roommates (hilarious Greta Gerwig as Patrice and Mindy Kaling as Shira) are overworked doctors lacking the time to get to know guys other than biblically. Veterans of keggers these gals are not fluent in the dead language of dating. Precious few of the men they encounter speak it either.Thus Patrices ""Eureka"" expression when a date opens her car door for her is priceless like that of the cavewoman who invented the wheel. Thus Adams horizon-scanning gaze as he takes Emma on a date is like that of Magellan circumnavigating a relationship.Too bad that because of its sexual content profanity and drug references the film is rated R and isnt suitable for those under 16. Younger teens probably would appreciate a movie that suggests that getting to know each other can be more satisfying than getting it on.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + We might have been guilty of romantic-comedy profiling on this one but going into ""No Strings Attached we had to wonder Whats Natalie Portman doing in a booty call confection with Ashton Kutcher? This is how you follow up ""Black Swan? It was nearly as curious to see her signing on for a genre entry directed by Ivan Reitman (""Ghostbusters) whos got a careers worth of comedy cred sure but not thanks to meet-cute stuff (see ""Legal Eagles ""Six Days Seven Nights).Silly us to think she wasnt making a smart choice. In fact the whole enterprise is pretty smart here from Kutchers unexpected sensitive-guy restraint to the crackerjack supporting cast to a script that mixes raunch and charm with surprising effectiveness. And it doesnt hurt that Portman and Kutcher really are sexy together.Mainstreaming her quirky ""Garden State wit Portman plays Emma an LA medical resident with a fear of commitment that extends all the way to being snuggle-phobic. Kutcher is Adam a good-hearted horndog whos had a thing for her ever since they were at summer camp together years back and whos as interested as ever when they meet again by chance.When an ex of Adams gets together with his blithely narcissistic sitcom-star dad (Kevin Kline) Adam goes on a night-long bender that ends with him landing on Emmas couch and soon enough in her bed. Hes immediately all about lovey-dovey texting and romantic gestures but shes got something else in mind a friends-with-benefits arrangement that will keep them satisfied at night without turning things weird between them. (Yeah good luck with that.)As far as rom-com obstacles to happiness go this one sounds characteristically contrived but Portman and Kutcher make it work appealingly. The film is also packed with enough sharply scripted screwiness from Adams roommate (Jake Johnson) Emmas roomie (Greta Gerwig) and others to keep viewer impatience to a minimum. Its some trick when a movie can throw in an entire scene of menstruation humor without being just plain tasteless. Go figure that the same movie riffs on the old lovebird shorthand of sharing a milkshake in a way that couldnt be sweeter.Tom Russo can be reached at trusso2222gmail.com.

By Dana Stevens After youve seen No Strings Attached check out our Spoiler Special discussion You can also download the program here or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed via iTunes or directly with our RSS feed. Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher in No Strings Attached For the past year or so Ive been grading romantic comedies on a curve Going the Distance got a break because of the minimalism of its low-concept plot and because it allowed its female lead played by Drew Barrymore to crack actual jokes that were occasionally even funny. Love and Other Drugs and How Do You Know got extra credit for being big sprawling and ambitious even if they fell short of pulling off their hairpin swerves from drama to comedy. But for 2011 its no more Mr. Nice Guy around here. No Strings Attached (Paramount Pictures) directed by 80s comedy legend Ivan Reitman ( Ghostbusters) and starring the Oscar-seeking Natalie Portman and a large cast of able comic performers has no excuse for being as wan charmless and laugh-free as it is. Rom-com writers of America youre going to have to step up your game. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. No Strings Attached was initially conceived as a raunchy female buddy comedy with the tough-to-market title Fk Buddies. Then the title was changed to Friends With Benefits and the script was subjected to a major rewrite. (The final product is credited to Elizabeth Meriwether.) The result of this tortured journey from page to screen is a bet-hedging mess. No Strings wants to be raunchy enough to pull in the dude crowd and snuggly enough to draw couples on dates. Instead its an inoffensive bore with occasional R-rated sex scenes that strain for cutesy shock value. Advertisement Doctor-in-training Emma (Natalie Portman) and TV production assistant Adam (Ashton Kutcher) have known each other vaguely since attending camp together in their teens. They meet again at a frat party in college and she impetuously invites him to a ""stupid thing"" the next day that turns out to be her fathers funeral. Heres where a sharper script might have stopped to investigate Why did Emma invite a near-stranger to her dads funeral under false pretenses then brusquely dismiss him afterward? Was she feigning indifference to the event or did she really dislike her father? The film treats this potentially character-revealing setup as a standard meet-cute moment squandering an opportunity to make us care. Whatever Emmas unspecified family problems are theyve turned her into a young woman whos ambitious and briskly unromantic. When Adam comes back into her life years later she proposes a ""sex friends"" setup whereby they can text each other for hookups anytime but never date snuggle or have breakfast together. Adam is more of a snuggler but on the advice of his standard-issue guy friends (Jake Johnson and Ludacris) he accepts Emmas offer of nookie-on-demand. A few awkward sex montages later Adam wants to get serious Emma freaks and withdraws and the plot machinery cranks and creaks desperately in its attempts to keep the two apart long enough to constitute a movie. Since we never learn quite why Emma is so averse to coupling with this sweet handsome loyal guy her resistance seems like a transparent narrative contrivance. Waiting for her to figure out that love is worth all the risks and complications isnt a journey; its merely an experience of duration. Adding to the apparent length of that duration is the lack of chemistry between the amiable shambling Kutcher and the tightly wound Portman. But the bland-on-bland central coupling isnt the most frustrating thing about No Strings Attached. Emma lives in a group house with other aspiring doctors two of them played by Mindy Kaling and Greta Gerwig both funny attractive actresses practically begging for better jokes to tell.  Kevin Kline plays Adams father a narcissistic former sitcom star who takes up with his sons vapid girlfriend (Ophelia Lovibond). Kline graciously wrestles with some of the movies most painful dialogue A scene in which he shares some fatherly advice on ""eating kitty"" inspired an audience-wide ""ew."" There are too many talented people lurking around the edges of this movie doing the comedic equivalent of manning a toll booth. I follow people on Twitter who write funnier lines than most of the ones in this script. And theyre working for free. Like Slate on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter.

(AP Photo/Paramount Dale Robinette) No Strings No Strings Attached is crude lewd and not very funny BY CALVIN WILSON  calvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com  314-340-8346 Jan 21 2011 (...) Dale Robinette Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman star in No Strings Attached. (AP Photo/Paramount Dale Robinette) Emma (Natalie Portman) and Adam (Ashton Kutcher) knew each other as teenagers. Their relationship was strictly platonic much to Adams disappointment. Now all grown up hes still interested in Emma who has no time for romance.But sleeping together -- well thats something else. And Adam is happy to oblige. A little intimacy goes a long way toward helping him cope with his morally dubious dad (Kevin Kline).Its not long before Adam realizes that even terrific sex can be unfulfilling. Unfortunately sex is all that Emma has to offer -- partly because training to be a doctor keeps her too busy for a relationship but also because shes afraid of being hurt. A lot of guys would like to have Adams problem but he wants more. At the very least hed like to take Emma out on the town. Or is that too much to ask? ""No Strings Attached"" is a foul-mouthed comedy which isnt necessarily a bad thing. ""Bad Santa"" (2003) also had plenty of crude language and lewd behavior. The difference is ""Bad Santa"" was extremely funny.Working from a screenplay by Elizabeth Meriwether director Ivan Reitman (""Ghostbusters"") seems terrified of boring the audience which he regularly appeases with cheap jokes that often have little or nothing to do with the overall story. About the best thing that can be said for the film is that Portman and Kutcher have just enough chemistry to make its premise work. Regardless of his limitations as an actor Kutcher who starred in televisions ""That 70s Show"" has a knack for undemanding fluff. His performance may lack oomph but within the context of its nonsensical surroundings its enjoyable.As for Portman a potential Oscar nominee for ""Black Swan"" theres something admirable about her search for Shakespearean depths in a character whose arc is thoroughly predictable.

Movies No Strings Attached by Lisa Schwarzbaum Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr FRIENDLY CARNAL KNOWLEDGE Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman try desperately not to fall in love in No Strings Attached (Dale Robinette) Posted January 28 2011 -- 1200 AM EST Can men and women be sex buddies without romantic attachment getting in the way? Of course not -- this is America Or so at least teaches No Strings Attached a hedging conservative romantic comedy directed with generational bafflement by Ghostbusters Ivan Reitman. The movie continues the long tradition of Hollywood rom-coms from When Harry Met Sally... to Knocked Up that bait with amusing naughty sex and then switch to reassuring romantic commitment. In this variation marketed for the age of hookups and friends with benefits a pretty romance-averse doctor-in-training named Emma (Natalie Portman) sets the rules governing her relationships no cuddling no morning-after breakfasts no learning. Just boinking. At first this is a Penthouse dream come true for a certain primo hottie named Adam (Ashton Kutcher in his zone). Hes the son of a vain babe-chasing former sitcom star (Kevin Kline whooping it up for his old Dave director). And the son has absorbed lessons in bed-hopping from the master. But the arrangement quickly proves unworkable. To be sure the sex is super-duper -- or so were told in one of those montages of frantically gymnastic but coy couplings suitable for an actress as essentially refined and modest as Portman. Its just that well Adam turns out to be too lovable honorable and emotionally open a gentleman for the cut-to-the-chase terms Emma offers. (The same darn tangles ensued when Jake Gyllenhaal boinked Anne Hathaway in Love amp; Other Drugs.) Id love to know what happened when Emma met Adam in the early drafts of this first screenplay by Elizabeth Meriwether a lively funny playwright (her play Heddatron mixes Ibsen and robots). As it is the current version bears the fingerprints of too many note-giving kibitzers who said How about a learning moment for Adams dad? Dont forget to include a Prius somewhere in the plot -- no Hollywood movie today is approved without one And so Emma takes the road most traveled coming to realize what everyone in the audience knew the minute Portman and Kutcher signed on to the pic The lady is much too traditional to live a stringless life. Really what Emma wants is to love and be loved like all the supporting female characters who wander through the movie. To which I say hooray for the other ladies. Just when we tire of admiring the simulation of another triumph in the sack along comes Junos wonderful feisty warmhearted Olivia Thirlby as Emmas younger sister who is radiantly unconflictedly happy about marrying her beau. Mumblecore honey and Greenberg star Greta Gerwig generates fresh air as Emmas roommate and fellow hospital intern a deadpan truth-teller whose quips dont keep her from appreciating a man who appreciates her. And The Offices inimitable Mindy Kaling enlivens her scenes as another roomie/doctor with a soft heart beneath her sexytalk. Adam is cute and all but the real strings worth tying are those that bind this sisterhood of sharp interesting sexually active women together. Wheres their starring movie?

"Comedy gets the romantic equation half-right - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Comedy gets the romantic equation half-rightNo Strings Attached a 2 starsJanuary 20 2011|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticFor a while the maddeningly uneven ""No Strings Attached"" succeeds on what it leaves out of its romantic comedy equation. The sour patronizing tone of so many recent romantic comedies comes through only occasionally. Elizabeth Meriwethers script doesnt treat the female characters shabbily in the way ""The Ugly Truth"" and ""The Bounty Hunter"" and ""Did You Hear About the Morgans?"" did. Also we dont have to sit through montages featuring people trying on wedding garb. Thats a relief. I sometimes wonder if the actress Katherine Heigl who does not appear here actually lives her life the way her ""27 Dresses"" character lived hers perpetually changing clothes to some pablum on the soundtrack. But at some point we must believe in the people were supposed to believe in up there on the picture screen as the old folks say. In ""No Strings Attached"" Natalie Portman plays an bright but emotionally guarded L.A. doctor-in-training who reconnects with a sometime acquaintance played by Ashton Kutcher. His character a fledgling writer and put-upon assistant on a ""Glee""-type TV series has three defining traits Hes ""nice"" ""annoyingly happy"" and a good lay. A more interesting actor could make do with those but Kutcher just doesnt seem to fill up a leading role especially when acting opposite the nuanced likes of Portman. Her character we hear is ""mean"" but obviously smart and a dear underneath all her cryptic defenses. The supporting cast is frustratingly talented. As Portmans character Emma strikes up a ""friends with benefits"" sex-only relationship with Kutchers Adam and they navigate their way to a happy ending (spoiler whoopsie) both hear an earful from their respective circles of generic friends. The delightful Greta Gerwig the indie actress recently gone mainstream (she was terrific in ""Greenberg"") loosens up the entire ensemble as one of Portmans fellow medical students. Lake Bell who should be starring in rom-coms not filling out the edges (as in ""Its Complicated"") shines as Adams smitten comically geeky TV colleague. Director Ivan Reitman cast this female half of this picture very very well. I wonder if a more astringent version of the screenplay got left behind somewhere around revision 27. The results are better than Reitmans previous feature ""My Super Ex-Girlfriend"" which gave galling misogyny a bad name. But with the exception of Kutcher who comports himself like a placeholder for the leading man who got lost en route to the Paramount lot the actors do what they can with what they have. Youve seen worse. The film industry is capable of better. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating R (for sexual content language and some drug material).

"No Strings Attached | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; no-strings-attached ) No Strings Attached (United States 2011) January 19 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Romantic comedies are a little like junk food theyre not healthy or sophisticated but when made right theres something addictive about their tasty familiarity. Going in you know what youre going to get. There are no surprises nasty or otherwise. The guy will capture the girls heart (or vice versa) and the courtship rhythms are pre-ordained. The story is so familiar that its like watching a re-run of something you have seen before but with different actors a different locale and (if youre lucky) a few new twists. Romantic comedies are popular because they are non-threatening and offer wish fulfillment. Failed examples typically dont work because the screenplay isnt sufficiently focused on the romance or because the leads are mis-matched. ""Chemistry"" is an overused term in the film industry but it is without question the 1 factor in determining the effectiveness of a motion picture residing in this genre. No Strings Attached Natalie Portmans follow-up to her likely Oscar nominated role in Black Swan falls into the competent-but-not-terrific category. It does most of the romantic comedy things right including offering occasional laughs providing a host of annoying and/or pointless secondary characters and saving declarations of love for the last act even though its clear the feelings exist long before they are voiced. To the extent that theres a problem it can be laid at the feet of the male lead. While theres nothing about his character thats a stretch for Ashton Kutcher the actors limitations are evident from the beginning. He looks good but these still waters dont run deep. If one was to pick a male lead based primarily on physical appeal Kutcher might be a good choice but even in a movie with as thin and threadbare a plot as this one he brings too little to the production. There are fitful sparks between him and Portman but he is unable to sustain viewer interest in his character. She becomes the dominant figure and that throws off No Strings Attacheds balance and impacts the all-important chemistry. This would seem to be a paycheck opportunity for Portman and in the past such films have not always elicited top-notch performances. Here perhaps because the role appears to have been tailored to her strengths shes credible. Emma is smart emotionally reserved and not given to emotional outbursts - perfect for Portman whose least effective moments are often the most emotionally charged ones. Shes not in form here (not that anyone would expect her to be) but theres nothing in her portrayal that will negatively impact any awards aspirations. Interestingly this is her first formulaic romantic comedy (Garden State doesnt count - that had a ""quirky indie"" vibe); its an oddity for a young attractive actress to have been in the business for 17 years before appearing in one of these. No Strings Attached fits into the romantic comedy category of sex-partners who violate their ""no emotions involved"" agreement and fall for each other. They are Adam (Kutcher) a TV series production assistant with aspirations of writing a script and Emma (Portman) a doctor struggling through her residency. Their paths which have briefly intersected several times in the past collide when Adams girlfriend dumps him for his famous father (Kevin Kline). After getting drunk he starts calling every number stored in his cell phone and this leads him inevitably to Emma. The next morning after he has recovered from being passed out in an apartment she shares with three roommates they have sex and form a pact each will be available whenever the other wants sex no strings attached. If emotions become involved however they will have to terminate the agreement. No Strings Attached boasts an interesting supporting cast. The spotlight-stealer is Kevin Kline who despite being in only a handful of scenes is the most memorable character in the movie. Other parts are filled by mumblecore queen Greta Gerwig as Emmas pretty roommate Lake Bell as one of the people to whom Adam is an assistant Cary Elwes as a staff doctor at the hospital where Emma works Ludacris as one of Adams friends and Olivia Thirlby as Emmas sister. Since no standard romantic comedy comes without romantic complications Bell fills that function. Director Ivan Reitman whose overall resume is impressive but who hasnt made anything memorable in about 20 years (in contrast to his son Jason whose Juno and Up in the Air have received recent Oscar consideration) has abandoned the ""safe"" PG-13 approach and instead opted for the more adult-oriented R. The choice is intentional; the core content may be PG-13 but the more restrictive certification was obtained by adding some gratuitous profanity. Its curious that at a time when so many films are being sanitized to get a PG-13 rating that Reitman has elected to go in the other direction. He is obviously pitching the movie at twentysomethings not teenagers. Despite the rating theres nothing edgy about No Strings Attached. The movies weaknesses are evident when it is compared to the similar Love and Other Drugs which addressed the same idea of fuck-buddies developing an attachment with a greater sense of urgency and honesty. Aside from the dubious choice of Kutcher as the male lead No Strings Attached suffers from snatches of poorly written dialogue. Although there are some genuinely amusing lines in the movie none are as hilarious as the riper unintentionally funny ones. At the screening I attended audience members were laughing a lot but not always at things Reitman intended. For the romantic comedy audience - those who attend movies of this genre out of a genuine love for this sort of thing - No Strings Attached delivers what it promises. Others need not bother but they probably wouldnt have anyway. The film is pleasant enough if inconsequential and will do nothing to help or hurt the careers of those involved. That its being released when Portman is suddenly hot is a bit of serendipity (the release date was set before she was viewed as an Oscar contender) but that may not provide a tangible boost at the box office. No Strings Attached is what it intends to be with no pretentions or apologies. Based on personal preferences each potential viewer will know whether theyll like it or not before attending.

"No Strings Attached (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review No Strings Attached (R) Acting and wit elevate the humor in this better-than-usual rom-com Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald1/19/2011 Editor rating 2.5 Early on in No Strings Attached Emma (Natalie Portman) and Adam (Ashton Kutcher) casual acquaintances since adolescence give in to the vague attraction they had always felt and have sex. The romp is so mutually satisfying that they strike a deal Theyll be each others ""sex friend"" available 24/7 by phone or text message but only for a private carnal rendezvous. No public displays of affection no cuddling or spooning no staring deep into each others eyes. That arrangement might work for say a married man with a mistress. But with two young good-looking and single people who obviously enjoy each others company the plan is destined to fail. No Strings Attached is a variation on When Harry Met Sally ... which argued that sex can ruin a friendship between a man and a woman. This time director Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters Stripes Meatballs) working from a witty script by Elizabeth Meriwether finds out whether a relationship can ruin a sexual connection. This is the first of two movies coming out this year to explore the question (Friends With Benefits starring Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake is due in July) and chances are both pictures will arrive at the same conclusion. But even though No Strings Attached is the sort of movie in which you know exactly how things will turn out five minutes into the story it makes the predictable journey surprisingly fun and enjoyable. Reitman a veteran of hit comedies (and father of Jason who directed Up in the Air) knows how to pace and edit around jokes for maximum comic effect and the script is unusually sharp for the rom-com genre stuffed with memorable lines and situations -- most of them gleefully R-rated -- that give the actors something to do other than riff and flail around in cute fashion. Portman who isnt exactly known as a comedienne visibly relishes the opportunity to play a sassy sexually confident free-spirited woman with a naughty streak (her performance is particularly enjoyable coming off Black Swan in which she spent most of her screen time in a tremulous terrified state). Kutcher will never be a great actor but hes more than fine as a likable honest guy who plays the female role in the relationship Hes the one who wants more than just sex from Emma a yearning that baffles his friends who dont understand why hes not satisfied with the arrangement (""You dont even have to have breakfast with her"" one notes) No Strings Attached is packed with memorable supporting characters such as Emmas fellow-medical-intern pals who are so close theyve started sharing their menstruation cycles (""Its like a crime scene in my pants"" one of them moans) Adams movie-star father (Kevin Kline) who has shacked up with his sons ex-girlfriend or Adams roommate Eli (Jake Johnson) who complains when the couple gets a little too noisy (""I cant focus on my porn with all this real sex going on"" he whines as he pounds on their bedroom door). The performances are all strong and the characters much more realized than is usual for this kind of picture. Unfortunately No Strings Attached eventually succumbs to the weepy melodrama that typically afflicts the third act of most romantic comedies and although Reitman is careful to keep sneaking in the jokes the movie starts to wear out its welcome while you wait for the lovebirds to come to their senses and do what they should have done a long time ago. No Strings Attached comes on strong and ends somewhat limply but the acting makes the movie much funnier than you might have expected. Imagine this same material with say Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler as the leads. The horror. The horror.

No Strings Attached Fair Director Ivan Reitman. Cast Natalie Portman Ashton Kutcher Greta Gerwig. Rating R for sexual content language and some drug material. Guide to this weeks new releases Greta Gerwig picks roles for experience Natalie Portman looks past rom-com cliches Yeah yeah the line forms over there. But at the front of it is Ashton Kutcher playing a dopey guy who still believes in love and figures if he works at it enough hell get Portmans character to come around too. Its an intriguing idea - if you put an actress as wonderfully talented as Portman in what is in many ways another romantic comedy plucked from the assembly line wherever such things are manufactured (well Hollywood) will it make a difference? The short answer is yes. Portman proves game for just about anything here the raunchier the funnier. The long answer is still yes though quite a bit more qualified. Adam and Emma meet at summer camp where she is established as brilliant and he as goofy but sweet. Then played by Kutcher and Portman they meet by chance in college. Shes on her way to becoming a doctor hes on his way to another party. She invites him to a ""thing"" which turns out to be her fathers funeral. And then they dont see each other for a few years. Nothing much comes of that meeting either except for Adam getting Emmas phone number which he will later call in a drunken stupor. Next thing you know they have embarked on a torrid sexual relationship albeit one with more rules than a presidential debate all designed to stave off intimacy. Its not a stretch to say that dippy good guy is a role Kutcher was born to. More intriguing is Portman as a sexually aggressive woman particularly on the heels of her brilliant performance as a repressed ballet dancer in ""Black Swan."" The Oscar folks wont come calling for ""No Strings Attached"" at least not for Portman. But it is a nice little diversion in a career increasingly filled with outstanding performances. ""Strings"" is Ivan Reitmans first directing gig since ""My Super Ex-Girlfriend"" in 2006 (in fact his son Jason has been in the spotlight more often). He makes good use of comic timing particularly among those in the supporting cast. Greta Gerwig making the leap from mumblecore to mainstream is especially funny as a fellow medical resident - in part because as with Portman this isnt what we expect of her. Kevin Kline is also good as Adams narcissistic TV-star father. Elizabeth Meriwethers script alas eventually travels down the well-worn path of romantic-comedy predictability the fear-of-commitment shoe being on the other foot notwithstanding. Its difficult for films like this to completely subvert expectation. Something like Portman playing against type is probably about the best we can hope for in most cases - certainly in this one. ""No Strings Attached"" has more genuine laughs than movies of this ilk usually do but it leads exactly where we think it will on a sometimes funny ultimately predictable journey.

Now before the impact has worn off and on the verge of an Oscar nomination she crumbles like a mildewed crumpet. Short of breaking into the editing lab and destroying the negative she should have done everything legally possible to stop the ill-timed release of a vulgar stupid pile of junk called No Strings Attached. This movie could destroy everything. Who deserves the blame for this worthless and unforgivable bore? Probably Ivan Reitman the Canadian hack who lowered the bar for brain-dead comedy by directing trash like Meatballs Kindergarten Cop and Cannibal Girls. He also produced such historic film classics as Trailer Park Boys Dog Hotel the Howard Stern horror Private Parts and the abominable Animal House. Do not confuse him with Jason Reitman who made the refreshing Up in the Air. Thats the son. So much for placing your future at a crucial turning point in your career in the hands of a pro. But wait. Ms. Portman is herself partly to blame. Nobody with an upwardly mobile career who is suddenly being taken seriously should co-star in a movie with Ashton Kutcher. She also executive-produced this mess. You cant trust anybody. No Strings Attached peddles the preposterous idea that two people terrified of committed relationships can have a perfectly normal happy and fulfilled life as ""sex buddies."" Emma (Portman) is a med-school student. Adam (Kutchner) is a struggling writer working as a glorified gofer on a noisy cookie-cutter TV rip-off of Glee. They met cute 15 years earlier on a one-night stand at summer camp then hooked up again at a drunken college pajama party. By the time their paths cross at a food festival (the movie knocks itself unconscious trying to think up kooky reasons and places to have sex) he wakes up naked and hung over in the apartment she shares with two girls and a creepy balding gay roommate who insists hes got menstrual pains. No wonder theyre afraid of intimacy; everyone around them is a sex-crazed lunatic auditioning for a psychotherapist. Even Emmas mother pointing to the creep snoring in the back seat of her sedan says ""Hes a remarkable lover."" [Pause.] ""Thats why they call him Bones."" Meanwhile Adam is stuck with a moronic faded TV star father (Kevin Kline) whos now shacked up with his own sons bimbo girlfriend and festering in a hospital bed after an overdose of vodka 7-Up and purple cough syrup. Mr. Kline once starred in Mr. Reitmans vastly superior film Dave so this must be the directors way of paying him back. At one point he dances and prances his way through a birthday party singing ""Im so happy ... to be your pappy"" The criminal waste of a first-rate talent in 10th-rate material is so embarrassing you want to recommend a good prosecuting attorney. The two stars use each other for sex at all hours of the day and night with no strings or-God forbid-love attached. Also no fighting lying jealousy gazing into each others eyes or speaking words with more than two syllables. He brings her a special soup that is good for her uterus. When things get intense she insists he has sex with total strangers but the girls he settles on for a threesome fall in love with each other. The big twister The farther they get from romance the closer they get to craving each other 24/7. Duh. A five-minute plot stretches over two hours of tedium that gives you a royal pain in the sacroiliac. The stars have zero charisma. Sexy and petite Ms. Portman outclasses her co-star in ways you cant even remember. Clumsy and superficial Mr. Kutcher is mired in the kind of clueless adolescent smirking that typified his obnoxious TV ""punking."" He cant act so when in doubt he clutches a towel to his johnson and bears his bubble butt to keep the teenage girls shrieking. Its two hours of ""Call me"" ""Dont call me"" ""Should I call him?"" ""He doesnt want me to call him."" Its a chore trying to describe the paralyzing tedium. Its also totally beneath Ms. Portman and Mr. Reitman is no help failing miserably to get under the skin of synthetic characters who are nothing more than one-dimensional cardboard caricatures in sitcom-ready cliches. The moronic screenplay by Elizabeth Meriwether forces Ms. Portman to prattle endlessly about condoms premature ejaculation menstruation and leaving the door open when she pees. The writer is quoted in the production notes confessing ""The film is a sort of wish fulfillment for me."" She must be the kind of girl who leaves the toilet seat down. rreedobserver.com NO STRINGS ATTACHEDRunning time 110 minutesWritten by Elizabeth MeriwetherDirected by Ivan ReitmanStarring Natalie Portman Ashton Kutcher Kevin Kline 1/4 Comment Filed under movie Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics No Alarms No Surprises Why Buying Concert Tickets Is a Rigged System Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://www.observer.com/2011/culture/love-and-other-drags,200,nostringsattached33,nostringsattached,observer

Fully devoid of the fantasy contrivance that often sets a Reitman film in motion Strings is for the most part extremely narrow in focus Its ""just"" about two people in lust struggling to put away their respective baggage in order to have a real relationship with each other. Its thesis is that for those of us who are not say academics-turned-paranormal-exterminators or regular joes forced to impersonate a coma-bound president love in itself can feel fairly high-concept. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Adam (Ashton Kutcher) a production assistant on a High School Musical-like series who would rather be a writer drunkenly texts every girl in his phone and wakes up the next morning at the apartment of Emma (Natalie Portman) a medical resident with whom hed had a couple of near-misses at summer camp and college. The pair begin rendezvousing during her off hours and the more she insists she doesnt believe in romance and warns him against falling in love the harder he pushes to change her mind.In fact Adam is such perfect persistent boyfriend material that the film repeatedly makes a joke out of it as in a wonderfully strange scene built around the good-natured support he offers Emma and her roommates when the whole household locks monthly cycles. That one of the films best gags involves a menstruation-themed mix CD including Frank Sinatras ""Ive Got the World on a String"" hints at its essentially harmless R-rated tone but Elizabeth Meriwethers script is sharp when its skewering the foibles of female insecurity. Emma and roommate Patrice (Greta Gerwig) are not the passive neurotics of so many contemporary chick flicks--theyre aggressive and declarative even when confused. Theyre also frat-party veterans who are so unfamiliar with anything like traditional romance that when it comes along theyre not quite sure what to do with it. While Emma resists callously suggesting to Adam that they each sleep around rather than submit to their growing intimacy Patrice enthusiastically--if awkwardly--embraces it.Very little happens in this film that couldnt realistically happen in the lives of actual beautiful-but-brainy non-obnoxiously moneyed and ambitious twentysomethings circa now and at times No Strings Attached feels almost shockingly attuned to the particular angst of its time and place. Emmas third-act flight from Adams feelings would play as a predictable beat in a rom-com that only wanted to tear its lovers apart so it could bring them together again; its to Meriwether and Reitmans credit that here it feels organic a testament to the difficulty of accepting love at face value in a culture in which artificiality is the norm sincere feelings are foreign enough to be frightening and old-fashioned romance can seem like a suspicious affect.The uneasy tension between the natural and the contrived is embodied in Reitmans well-chosen real L.A. locations. Feelings that can no longer be contained come spewing out in an outdoor mall backdropped with a blur of neon signs; a relationship fissure opens within the tight corridors of Chris Burdens ""Urban Light"" installation in front of LACMA. These vibrant emotional duets set within the citys highly contrived public spaces subtly sketch Los Angeles as a place where the real is often hiding in plain sight among the profoundly synthetic.The idea of keeping it real in a highly artificial climate is mirrored by Meriwethers script itself which takes a moribund stock genre skeleton and animates it with multilayered characters who for the most part speak in the casual cadences of real people.The films one major misstep is a subplot involving an improbable rivalry between Adam and his dad (Kevin Kline) an aging star deep in midlife crisis--and a blatant device to explain Adams romantic resolve as a sons rebellion as well as a vehicle for the films general sympathy for the introspective outsiders waging the good fight (both professionally and personally) against Hollywood assholery. Which is ironic because every time this story strain bubbles up it leaves a shtick stain that reeks of crass Hollywood conventionality. It certainly seems at odds with Meriwethers larger and highly successful project fitting realistic life into the structures of Hollywood genre and confidently making the case that the tsuris of just being 26 and trying to figure out how to love and be loved is conflict enough.1 Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Karina Longworth Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

TWITTER Predictable cutesy and nowhere near hot-blooded enough for a story about two friends with benefits who cant keep their hands off one another ""No Strings Attached"" just barely squeaks by due to its larky depiction of the management of a sex-by-appointment relationship. In the sort of blandly mainstream romantic comedy she has generally avoided Natalie Portman works overtime to keep the leaky ship afloat but Ashton Kutcher cant be budged out of puppy dog mode. Date and girls night out appeal is sufficient for Paramount to anticipate decent mid-winter box-office returns for this rosy-cheeked (and occasionally exposed-cheeked) R-rated romp. Returning from the longest hiatus of his career (his last feature was the unheroic My Super Ex-Girlfriend five years ago) director Ivan Reitmans technique looks a little rusty especially in the early-going as its clunkily established that Emma (Portman) and Adam (Kutcher) have been potential bedbuds ever since he made an unseemly pubescent proposition 15 years earlier. Grown-up now in Los Angeles Emma is a doctor-in-training while Adam is a writer on a Glee-like TV show who in a grossly overdone interlude drinks himself senseless upon learning that his vapid girlfriend has taken up with his much-married dad former TV star Alvin (Kevin Kline). Awakening from his bender naked in the apartment Emma shares with three sitcom-ready roommates Adam takes advantage of his natural state by finally getting it on with this no-nonsense young lady who soon proposes they regularly meet for sex but nothng more. No guy is going to turn down a deal like that but the mild twist in Elizabeth Meriwethers screenplay is that its Adam who craves getting serious not Emma who works 80 hours per week and claims shes no good at real relationship stuff. For their part Reitman and Meriwether shy away from the passionate side of sex preferring to go for laughs by serving up a smorgasbord of goofy locations and funny positions in which the easy-on-the-eyes pair take their pleasure. The obligatory complications in this easy arrangement are minor by classic sex farce standards among them Emmas misperception of a cheating three-way involving Adam and the latters fraught relationship with Alvin who would like to think of himself as the young mans friendly rival rather than as his father. But the real complication is love Adams for Emma and her rejection of its viability. Sweet as he is Adam tries in the nicest way to move things to a higher plane but shell have none of it--until she does of course. Other than the storys obvious destination the biggest problem is Adams blandness and one-dimen sionality. For this the script and Kutchers performance would seem to share equal blame. Meriwether gives the man absolutely nothing interesting to say and never for a moment does he seem like a writer who might have once struggled over the choice of a word a plot or an idea. Kutchers performance in Spread two years ago indicated hes able to suggest the arrogance and self-satisfaction of the successful stud who knows how to satisfy a woman. A hint of this trait would have been welcome here as would have anything else that might have made the character seem like something more than rice pudding with a nice head of hair. So its left to Portman and a couple of the supporting actors to juice things up which they do superficially but sufficiently to forestall total ennui. Portman supplies enough tensile strength to Emma that you really believe she doesnt want emotional involvement and isnt just pretending. While the actress (whos also an executive producer here) doesnt seem like a natural comedienne her vibrant personality not to mention her looks insures that shell pop out of a crowd even one made up of wisecracking comics and diverse physical types. As a hyper-talkative TV producer Lake Bell nails a certain workaholic Hollywood type so accustomed to being in charge at work that she scarcely knows how to behave (or shut her mouth) in more relaxed intimate moments. Kline who starred for Reitman in Dave 18 years ago is a perfect fit for his aging Lothario but could sorely have used some better lines.

The benefits of a sexy young cast seem to have modestly recharged director Ivan Reitmans batteries in ""No Strings Attached."" Predicated on the not especially burning question of whether two friends can sustain a commitment-free sexual relationship this genial if overlong romantic comedy bounces along on a steady stream of amusing moments even as it presents the most polished and predictable version of a scenario that cries out for greater verbal and visual candor given its R rating. Still the central pairing of Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher should make the passable January release an easy sell with date-night crowds. ""No Strings Attached"" was originally titled ""Friends With Benefits"" which was changed to avoid confusion with a forthcoming Justin Timberlake-Mila Kunis comedy bearing the same name and a near-identical premise Two longtime acquaintances agree to use each others bodies for around-the-clock emotion-free no-questions-asked gratification. In presenting this arrangement Elizabeth Meriwethers screenplay attempts to tap into the social mores of young urbanites in an era of malleable commitment levels and seemingly limitless sexual options their booty calls facilitated more smoothly than ever by the wonders of text messaging and the Internet. Zippy opening sequence establishes the friendship of Emma (Portman) and Adam (Kutcher) skipping ahead a few years at a time from awkward adolescence to attractive adulthood. Both hail from affluent corners of Los Angeles; shes a driven medical student while hes an aspiring writer with a crappy below-the-line gig on a ""Glee""-esque TV show. Emma has cultivated a pragmatic unsentimental view of sex over the years while Adam has just been dumped by his gold-digging girlfriend (Ophelia Lovibond) whos taken up with Adams father a self-infatuated former tube star (Kevin Kline appropriately hammy). Eager to drown his sorrows with meaningless sex Adam goes on a drunk-dialing bender and awakens the next morning to find himself naked in Emmas apartment in the pics one remotely bawdy sequence. Emma assures Adam they didnt sleep together but their mutual attraction is so natural that they proceed to do just that again and again. Emma plants herself firmly in the drivers seat of this purely physical relationship dictating clear emotional boundaries (no jealousy no cuddling no breakfast the morning after) which Adam an instinctive romantic has his own goofy ways of circumventing. Playing characters with a decidedly laid-back view of getting laid the two leads possess an agreeably mellow chemistry that somewhat neutralizes the fact that they feel so unevenly matched on paper. Whereas Portman is given a character with a specific worldview Kutcher gets slapped with a set of outlandish daddy-drama complications that detract from the relatability of the films key questions Can sex between friends remain a simple transaction? Can you make love without falling in love? Romantic-comedy conventions and happy endings necessitate that these questions be answered in the negative. But one could argue that ""No Strings Attached"" never really poses them in the first place Adam and Emma look like a pretty cute couple from the get-go and most of their quickie couplings are shot to look as tidy artificial and montage-driven as most MPAA-approved sex scenes. Reitmans comic timing remains crisp enough to get mileage out of the scripts occasionally inspired zingers but a director with a heightened perception of nuances of body language and an ability to convey them to the audience would have given the pic a more provocative core beneath its generic trappings. As it is ""No Strings Attached"" is content to be sweet rather than edgy to make you go ""awww"" instead of ""hmmm"" and in that respect it more than fulfills its obligations as a commercial product. It also has a little something extra in Portman who humorously and movingly charts her characters gradual awakening to her true feelings; in a refreshing departure from the norm neither actress nor script suggests that Emmas independence and desire for intimacy are mutually exclusive values. Per specifications Emma and Adam each get a peanut gallery of supportive friends roommates and co-workers; thesps include Olivia Thirlby Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges a never-more-mainstream Greta Gerwig and a nearly unrecognizable Cary Elwes in a bizarre third-billed cameo. The standout in this unwieldy and not always well-deployed supporting cast is Lake Bell whose awkward twitchy yet sweet-natured performance as Adams erstwhile love interest almost makes you want to follow her into a movie of her own. D.p. Rogier Stoffers bright-colored lensing shows an eye for picturesque L.A. landmarks including Walt Disney Concert Hall and LACMAs Urban Lights exhibit highlighting a slick tech package. End-credits wrap-up emphasizes the materials more sitcom-ish aspects.
