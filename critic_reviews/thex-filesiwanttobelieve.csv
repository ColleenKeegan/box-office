Comments The X-Files I Want to Believe The second big-screen spin-off of the cult TV show is a ""stand alone"" that nonfans can follow without knowing the series fiendishly complicated backstory. The problem is that only a fan would be inclined to tolerate this dunderheaded mystery in which the FBI recruits former agents Mulder (David Duchovny) and Scully (Gillian Anderson) to help find a missing woman. In addition to the usual paranormal stuff writer-director Chris Carter has added some canned Catholicism clues arrive in the visions of a wiggy pedophile priest (Billy Connolly) and in a groaner of a subplot Dr. Scully now employed as a surgeon struggles to save a dying boy whose only hope is a radical new treatment and a whole lot of faith.

This belated follow-up helmed by series creator Chris Carter feels like a self-contained TV episode. At its heart is the emotional relationship between ex-FBI paranormal investigators Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) a troubled agnostic who wants to believe and Dr Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) a rational sceptic. This humanises the scripts big ideas about faith versus science but also scales down the events. While fans may welcome this back-to-basics approach casual viewers expecting another spectacular tale of spaceships and aliens could be disappointed.When a female FBI agent is abducted Mulder believes the visions of psychic priest Father Joe (Billy Connolly) hold the key to the mystery; Scully thinks the ex-paedophile is trying to expiate his past sins. With Father Joes help sundry body parts are found some containing traces of animal tranquiliser. Organ theft it seems may be the motive. This chimes oddly with Scullys own medical dilemma she is contemplating painful experimental stem cell therapy for a young boy with an incurable degenerative disease. On the one hand a vivisectionist nightmare on the other an ethically ambiguous dream of power over death. In its prime The X-Files tapped in to a zeitgeisty fascination with paranormal phenomena and conspiracy theories. But six years after the show sputtered to a close Carter Duchovny and Anderson are going through the motions. Lazy plotting so-so performances and squandered ideas lead to only one diagnosis there is no compelling reason to keep this moribund formula on a life-support machine.

Gillian Andersons performance is a revelation proving she is one of the top contemporary talents. ""I Want To Believe"" is a dark moody film concerning one couples struggle to reconcile within themselves and each other the opposing forces of science faith and philosophy. Two people so consumed by a need to save what has already been lost seeking relief or redemption for a self-perceived crime or sin that they nearly destroy the very thing that offers them any solace or comfort in the world.

The parallels between Scullys story and the main plot leave you with some fairly profound notions.

ABOUT THE MOVIE The X-Files I Want to Believe  (out of four)Stars David Duchovny Gillian AndersonDirector Chris CarterDistributor 20th Century FoxRating PG-13 for violent and disturbing content and thematic materialRunning time 1 hour 40 minutesOpens Friday nationwide  SUMMER MOVIE GUIDE By Claudia Puig USA TODAY There may be no going back as much as we might want to believe otherwise. Maybe the X-Files-- the TV phenomenon of 1993-2002 that influenced such popular shows as Lost and Heroes-- was a product of its time. Or maybe its just too difficult to re-create such an engrossing series on the big screen. The X Files I Want to Believe just cant capture the magic. For one thing the Mulder-Scully chemistry seems to have evaporated. David Duchovny is still engagingly low-key as the truth-seeking Fox Mulder while Gillian Anderson as Dana Scully seems to have become even more dour. Grounded in science her doctor character was always serious but she has lost some of what made her more human passionate emotions and flashes of dry humor. Theres a discernible lack of sparks during a bedroom scene. Sure its meant to be cozy rather than sexy but it feels forced. When the film opens Mulder and Scully have left their top-secret work uncovering paranormal forces. But they are drawn back in when an FBI agent (Amanda Peet) needs help determining the veracity of a priest claiming to know the whereabouts of a missing fellow agent. The concept of belief in its many facets is critical to the plot. The film poses intriguing ethical and spiritual questions. The psychic priest (Billy Connolly) is central to many of them; he divides not just Mulder and Scully on the question of ESP but also many FBI operatives. To his credit director and co-screenwriter Chris Carter doesnt easily resolve many of these complex questions. The audience is left trying to draw connections between ethical dilemmas and plot points and often no resolution materializes. While Carter has engaged the audience on an ethical level he has thrown a wedge between his protagonists and their fans. On the show the viewer would solve the mystery along with Mulder and Scully. In the movie the clues are revealed to the audience while others remain in the dark. As a result the sense of suspense key to a supernatural thriller is diminished. The film also skimps on plot; dont expect the clever intricate twists of the series. It feels like a wan version of the show -- one that has lost its otherworldly edge.

July 25 2008 The X-Files I Want to Believe (out of 4) Starring David Duchovny Gillian Anderson Billy Connolly Amanda Peet and Alvin ""Xzibit"" Joiner. Directed by Chris Carter. 144 minutes. At major theatres. 14A The wacky spaceship X-Files crashes to Earth with a resounding thud in its second movie incarnation - and lets hope those pesky aliens give it a proper burial this time.We shall commence the interment by reflecting on the folly of returning to a TV series about astral invasions and other paranormal mischief that played like an extended bong hit during its 1993-2002 run.The X-Files had its heyday in the pre-9/11 world a more innocent time when threats to Americas security were deemed so unbelievable as to be not of this world more Marvin the Martian than Osama bin Laden.Not even David Duchovnys wily Fox Mulder could have envisioned a scenario where terrorists would hijack U.S. airplanes and use them as missiles to bring down skyscrapers.The series set its sights higher than most horror shows which is why it cant survive the mortal tedium of The X-Files I Want to Believe a slapdash movie that show creator Chris Carter directed and co-wrote (with Frank Spotnitz who also produced with Carter).Gone are the head-expanding plots about shifty alien invaders and ""monsters in the dark"" to use the eloquent phrase by Gillian Andersons truth-seeker Dr. Dana Scully reunited once again with her acerbic partner Mulder.Gone are The Lone Gunmen Cigarette Smoking Man and other colourful characters of both the small-screen series and the first big-screen adaptation Fight the Future released in 1998.Instead we get a patchwork plot about a psychic pedophile priest and Russian body snatchers that achieves just one incredible feat it manages to be both mundane and utterly absurd at one and the same time.It begins with the kidnapping of a female FBI agent from her remote cabin a heinous act that results in the rounding up of a bizarre group of would-be rescuers.A diddling ex-priest named Father Joe (Billy Connolly) who claims to have psychic powers is summoned to lead the search even though FBI investigators Dakota Whitney (Amanda Peet) and Mosley Drummy (rapper Alvin ""Xzibit"" Joiner) think hes just a pretentious perv.To add to the fun former FBI spooks Mulder and Scully are also sought out even though both have long since holstered their ray guns a fully bearded Mulder is doing his best impersonation of Sasquatch in a woodland retreat while he simmers over Bureau snubs of years past; and Scully is working as a full-time surgeon in a Dickensian Catholic hospital where compassion is non-existent and patient survival ranks lower than economic efficiency.There is some brief to-and-fro between Mulder and Scully alluding to their now dormant love affair a romance that has progressed almost as slowly as the lead-footed aliens of the main TV tale.Those aliens by the way are dismissed with a sarcastic zinger sent Mulders way by Xzibits cranky FBI guy ""His sister was abducted by E.T.""So much for years of carefully crafted plot paranoia. But Carter seems willing to roast his entire series by aiming for the gut instead of the brain. Hes more interested now in attracting younger moviegoers who enjoy the viscera of the Hostel and Saw films and who may not even have watched The X-Files in reruns.Shunned devotees of the original TV series can take some comfort in that Anderson and Duchovny dont dishonour their characters even though theyre required to mouth dialogue from a script that Carter wouldnt have used to line the litter-box of a two-headed cat during the shows glory years. A script so inconsistent and wrong-headed it mocks George W. Bush while also making a homophobic reference to gay marriage. The recurrent theme of doubt and belief meanwhile is hammered home with zero subtlety amounting to little more than various FBI types accusing each other of falling for Father Joes increasingly urgent astral visions.Connolly is an odd choice to play the pedophile psychic but he overacts with gusto and hes got one for the record books what other ham actor could claim to have spurted blood from his eyeballs in service of pure melodrama?Hed have to go some though to top Scullys subplot howler in her efforts to save the life of a young boy dying from a rare brain disease she teaches herself how to do risky stem-cell surgery by surfing Google.Astute readers will note that I have abstained from making cheap cracks about the I Want to Believe title an almost superhuman feat given this movies abundance of sheer nonsense.Thats because believing this mess isnt really at issue given the shows tenuous connection with reality at the best of times.Weird we can dig. Stupid and boring however are truths out there that are just too hard to bear.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

So youre getting this from someone who doesnt know ""The X-Files"" never wanted to know it and didnt even see the first ""X-Files"" movie. As such there will be no pronouncements here as to how fans of the old TV series will receive this screen version. One thing can be said here with certainty Knowing nothing zero nulla nada and bubkes about ""X-Files"" is no impediment to enjoying ""X-Files I Want to Believe"" - and appreciating it for the well-acted adult piece of work that it is. Its difficult to take familiar characters who have been developed and established over countless hours of series television and put them over within minutes for an audience who doesnt know them. But director Chris Carter and actors David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson make it look easy. Instead of being anxious to inform the audience of the characters rich histories they let the histories come through unburdened by needless detail. The emotional details are there. Theyre present in the character interaction and even in the lived-in interaction between the actors and their roles. For example and this may seem like a small thing its rare to see someone play a physician and be as thoroughly believable as Andersons Dana Scully. Its part of the texture of the film that no matter what Scully is doing outside the hospital some of the physicians aura - of living on the frontlines of suffering and illness of having an unshakeable ever-present awareness of human frailty - is brought to bear in Andersons performance. Anderson looks at people as if she knows more than she wants to know as if she knows how they might end up. And thats precisely how she looks at Duchovny as Mulder her former investigative partner. On the outs with his former employer the FBI he has spent the past six years ... actually its hard to say what hes been doing besides throwing pencils at the ceiling and clipping articles from the newspaper. But then an FBI agent (Amanda Peet always nice to see her) reunites Mulder and Scully and brings Mulder in to consult on a case An FBI agent has gone missing. The two former partners go to the old FBI building and stand outside an office looking at pictures of George W. Bush and J. Edgar Hoover in the hallway. Then they exchange blank glances as if to say ""Do we really belong here?"" In their old capacity Mulder and Scully were part of a special unit that dealt with anything from telepathy to alien abductions. This time the case is fairly earthbound. Theres a pedophiliac former priest (Billy Connolly) who claims to have visions that might help the authorities find the missing agent. Mulder an expert on the paranormal is needed to help determine whether the priest is for real. It also helps that hes an eccentric too a particularly sensitive one and knows how to talk to such people. Carter and co-screenwriter Fred Spotnitz have devised a compelling suspense thriller with some tense moments and Carter has infused the film with an atmosphere of not gloom but sorrowful reflection. The movie is concise though at times too concise In one or two scenes the dialogue is so spare and anemic that the actors have trouble putting over what the moment demands. Still Carters restraint is admirable and so is his willingness to embrace ambiguity and complexity in what could have been just another summer action movie. Of course in the end its all about these very full and rewarding lead characters. Youthful but decidedly middle-aged theyve seen more than their share of darkness and theyve reacted the way men and women respectively tend to react. She by internalizing it absorbing it and understanding it. He by denying it resisting it and then plunging into contact with it. In this way Mulder and Scully are like functioning models of the male and female principles. The beauty of their interplay is that each recognizes the value of the others approach and understands that every so often the other is going to be right. -- Advisory Violence gore and frightening situations.

"X-Files The I Want to Believe | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; x-files-the-i-want-to-believe ) X-Files The I Want to Believe (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli One would expect that the title of the second X-Files movie I Want to Believe reflects the hope of fans worldwide about this production. They want to believe that even six years after the sell-by date has expired these characters can still be relevant and showrunner Chris Carter still has worthwhile stories to tell. Sadly such hope is misplaced. The X-Files I Want to Believe is an exercise in mediocrity. Its curious how little of the TV series charm and appeal can be found in this uneven plodding excuse for a reunion. Rather than providing a springboard to a movie franchise this film puts the final nail in The X-Files coffin. Mulder and Scully can now fade into pop culture history. The question of ""why?"" comes up several times when considering this movie. Why now? Why wait until six years after the shows 2002 finale to resurrect the characters? Interest in The X-Files has declined precipitously since then; even some former die-hards I know are lukewarm about the film. Timing has a lot to do with box office success and the timing couldnt be worse for this project. And why tell this story? One would think that given six years to develop a plot Carter could have come up with something more compelling. The X-Files I Want to Believe lacks big ideas meaningful character interaction and a sense of energy that a production like this badly needs to keep viewers from dozing off. And even if the sole purpose for the film is to bring back Mulder and Scully for one last hurrah why are there so few scenes of them actually working together? Had this storyline shown up as one episode of a 20+ episode series it would have been dismissed as an ""off week."" For it to form the foundation of a major motion picture is inexcusable. The decision not to delve into the TV series convoluted conspiracy theories is understandable since that would alienate a large portion of the potential audience but to proceed in this direction making I Want to Believe a warmed-over serial killer story with supernatural overtones boggles the mind. This is a big-time theatrical release with TV movie quality writing and production values. I Want to Believe picks up six years after the TV series ended. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are living together in a secluded house where he has grown a beard and looks like Grizzly Adams and she has become a doctor at a Catholic hospital. Neither works for the FBI any more. But when a psychic pedophile priest Father Joe (Billy Connelly) has visions associated with a missing FBI agent the agency wants Mulder back on the job. Reluctantly at first he agrees and ends up working with agents Dakota Whitney (Amanda Peet) and Mosley Drummy (Alvin Xzbit Joiner). Their goal use supernatural clues provided by Father Joe to locate the missing person. Scully disillusioned about the FBI chooses not to participate and goes back to trying to save the life of a young patient. For many the appeal of The X-Files lies in the chemistry between Mulder the believer and Scully the skeptic. The ying-and-yang of their interaction provided the backbone of the series. It is almost entirely absent - and sorely missed - here. Also gone any hint of sexual tension. Admittedly since these two have stated their love for one another and are now living and sleeping together one wouldnt expect this to be part of the equation but it hasnt been replaced by a new dynamic such as a loving trusting relationship. In fact judging by the dialogue these two never seem to communicate despite living under the same roof. The films central ""mystery"" is painfully underdeveloped. The pedophile priest in addition to being a walking clichA(c) adds little to the proceedings and the revelation about what lies behind the kidnappings and murders is B-grade bad. The film musters a little tension toward the end with Mulder in peril but thats in stark contrast to the dull and tedious 90 minutes to precede it. One keeps waiting for I Want to Believe to shift into high gear and it never does. Do we ever believe that the characters are in danger or that their ""mission"" means anything? No. The film feels like an excuse for nostalgia. The actors dont seem to care either. Duchovny is okay and the film was apparently made largely because he made himself available for it but the Mulder in this film is a lot more laid-back than his TV series counterpart. Gillian Anderson claims that it was difficult for her to re-discover the character after such a long layoff and it shows. Scully is a shadow of what she once was. Most distressingly where these two used to play brilliantly off one another here they never mesh even on those occasions when the screenplay allows them to share the screen. Whats the point of a reunion if the characters are going to be kept apart so much? Amanda Peet has more scenes with Duchovny than Anderson does. The 1998 The X-Files movie made at the height of the shows popularity was an entertaining lark. Not being a big fan of the series I didnt get all the in-jokes and side-references but as science fiction films go it was fun. And I could sense the connection between Mulder and Scully. I Want to Believe seems like it was made by another group for a different audience. As nothing more than another summer movie I Want to Believe will be ill-accepted by viewers with little or no X-Files background; its too derivative and generic to generate more than a shrug and an exclamation of ""ho-hum."" For X-Philes the pleasure of re-connecting with old friends may not be enough to obscure how poorly those old friends are treated by the material. Aficionados of the TV show may want to believe but after this movie theyll have trouble keeping the faith.

Unlike its theatrical predecessor a decade ago which was bound into the series mythology to a point of near incomprehensibility ""IWTB"" is billed as a stand-alone entity accessible to newbies. PHOTO GALLERY X-Files I Want To Believe As a newbie I can attest that this is true. But its an open question whether those unfamiliar with the series will much care about the relationship between David Duchovnys Fox Mulder and Gillian Andersons Dana Scully which takes precedence here over an utterly generic plot about a search for a serial killer. There are no extra-terrestrials this time around. The paranormal angle is Father Joe (the splendidly cast Scottish comedian Billy Connolly) a guilt-ridden pedophile priest whose psychic powers are employed in the search for a missing FBI agent. For reasons that are never clearly spelled out Father Joes participation prompts the agent on the case (Amanda Peet wasted) to reach out to Scully who has left the bureau and is working as a medical doctor at a Catholic hospital. Scully persuades her reluctant former partner Mulder - who is wanted by the FBI for vague reasons - to accept an offer of amnesty in exchange for following an obvious trail of severed limbs leading to the culprit. ""Never give up"" Father Joe advises Scully whos unsure whether the disgraced priest is talking about Mulders case or her own a dying young patient whose only chance is experimental stem-cell therapy. Im not going to pierce the supposed veil of secrecy surrounding the films plot but its not exactly hard to figure out how the two cases connect well before Scully does. Lets just say that among other things it updates the tired old stereotype of the psychotic gay killer with a reference to same-sex marriage. Series creator Chris Carter who wrote the script with longtime collaborator Frank Spotnitz largely eschews action to focus on his two leads chemistry which thankfully remains intact. There are also a few good offhand jokes including a suggestion that a certain second-generation US president is an alien. ""The X-Files I Want to Believe"" is atmospheric and moves briskly but its basically TV writ large. lou.lumenicknypost.com MORE Lou Lumenicks Movies Blog Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next MAD ABOUT VINCENT KARTHEISER Read Next MAD ABOUT VINCENT KARTHEISER Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 43697 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 28216 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops 17149 Braves Brian McCann interest may pave way for Gary Sanchez Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Elizabeth Weitzman Tuesday July 29 2008 635 PM Ill freely admit that as a fan I approached the new ""X-Files"" movie with some apprehension. After all we havent seen these characters since the series ended six long years ago. But if nine seasons a movie and endless reruns have taught us anything its the importance of faith. And indeed when those familiar six notes opened the film I felt a chill that didnt fade until the screen turned black (stick around for the closing credits).On the other hand the show also valued healthy skepticism. So trust no one - not even creator Chris Carter who insists ""I Want to Believe"" was made with newcomers in mind. On the contrary if you arrive with no previous knowledge of the series youll leave wondering how it ever became a worldwide phenomenon. When the sequel begins former FBI agent Scully (Gillian Anderson) is a successful doctor. In contrast her old partner Mulder (David Duchovny) has apparently modeled himself after the Unabomber. Heavily bearded and obsessively isolated he cant leave the past behind. When two young agents (played flatly by Amanda Peet and rapper Xzibit) ask for help Scully is decidedly reluctant. But theres no stopping Mulder and soon theyre interviewing a very troubled allegedly psychic priest (Billy Connolly) about a series of kidnappings. The truth is the mystery pales next to the best ""X-Files"" plots. But fans will appreciate sly references to past episodes an unexpected appearance from an old friend and the still-poignant bond our heroes share. Most important we get to see two gifted actors passionately revisit the roles that may forever define them. Anderson is typically excellent while Duchovny taps into a surprising vulnerability both creating a fuller character and remaining true to the one we know. But there it is again. What it comes down to is this Do you feel like you already know Mulder and Scully? If the answer is yes this is a welcome chance to spend a little more time in their company. And if the answer is no its not too late to find out why anybody still cares. But hold off on the movie and start by renting Season One. Believe me Itll be worth it. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""The X-Files I Want to Believe"" might satisfy the TV series diehard fans but the rest of us will groan ""I want to be leaving."" Low in budget inspiration and excitement the film feels less like a bigger better widescreen reworking of the old goblins-and-G-men show than a forgotten script agonizingly stretched to feature length. Set in snowbound stretches of the West Virginia countryside the story concerns some baffling abductions that inspire the FBI to offer disgraced spookchaser Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) clemency in exchange for his help. It seems that a priest (Billy Connolly) with a shameful past has been having psychic visions that might disclose the location of a missing agent. But the FBI cant even find Mulder without the help of his old partner Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). Now a pediatric surgeon with a life-or-death case on her hands Scully is reluctant to get involved with the agency again and loath to further strain her vexed relationship with Mulder. Of course they must reunite or there is no film so the on-again-off-again couple are soon ankle-deep in slush and sleuthing. A stretch of frozen lake yields dozens of severed human limbs in a mystery murkily connected to a band of medical grave robbers. The crimes in question are rather low-stakes (no werewolves or alien invaders this time) and so is the drama directed by series creator Chris Carter with a script he co-wrote with Frank Spotnitz. The films vital signs seem to be keyed to Duchovnys sluggish metabolism. Were 70 minutes into the case before there is so much as a foot chase. Instead we get brooding music ominous shots of snowbound terrain and many closeups of the frowning stars. There is much chin-stroking discussion of Gods will affecting the course of human affairs loss of faith and the competing claims of religion and science. But it feels like so much padding added to bring the film in at 104 minutes. Amanda Peet and Alvin Joiner (aka rapper Xzibit) spin their wheels as a pair of new FBI agents with opposite opinions of Mulders methods. A featured player from the old TV show drops in for an extended cameo contributing about as much to the proceedings as if he passed through via a revolving door. THE X-FILES I WANT TO BELIEVE  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for violent and disturbing content and thematic material. The X-Files I Want to Believe showtimes Still hes an action star compared with Duchovny who might be the most useless hero of 2008. Duchovnys character is repeatedly overpowered in fights is outdriven by a villain driving a rickety old snow plow and has no substantial romantic scenes with Anderson. She carries most of the drama in her role as a physician struggling with hospital bureaucracy and employing radical surgery to save her young patient. Unfortunately the film expires on the operating table.

David Duchovny left and Gillian Anderson are shown in a scene from ""The X-Files I Want to Believe."" Photo Diyah Pera. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald Call it the anti Dark Knight The new X-Files movie must be the least-hyped film of the summer if not the entire year. Its unclear why the studio has been so shy about I Want to Believe which if not exactly thrilling or groundbreaking would have made a fairly solid (though not top-notch) episode of the Fox TV series. The plot is more convoluted than it ought to be -- trimmed down to episode size it mightve been better -- but fans cant help but enjoy seeing the FBI heroes Fox Mulder and Dana Scully on the big screen after all this time. Series creator Chris Carter who co-wrote the script with XF alum Frank Spotnitz has smartly freed himself from the impenetrable web of the alien invasion conspiracy that was the focus of the show and the first XF film Fight the Future. Instead he turns to another pet theme The difficulty of sustaining faith in difficult times. What is Mulders relentless search for the truth if not a demand for an answer to mankinds No. 1 question? (XF was never just about the monsters or the aliens. Even though monsters and aliens are fun.) I Want to Believe turns out to be introspective never really achieving a good scare. Its content instead to be mildly creepy and reflective a mood sustained by the near-constant snowfall and chilly landscapes. The film opens with a call to Scully (Gillian Anderson) now working at a Catholic hospital. An FBI agent (Amanda Peet) and her skeptical sidekick (a surprisingly effective Alvin Xzibit Joiner) want her to track down the off-the-grid Mulder (David Duchovny) to help with a tricky case involving missing women body parts and a psychic pedophile priest (Billy Connolly) who claims to see visions of the victims. Scully is repulsed by the priests past but she knows where Foxs den is -- of course she does; she lives there -- and soon the partners are squabbling about his stubborn insistence on throwing himself wholeheartedly back into the dark side and her reluctance to follow him there. In the meantime Scullys also trying to save a sick young boy at the hospital though its hard to say how successful shell be considering shes downloading tips on stem cell therapy off Google. Not all of the plot threads pan out convincingly and some of the FBI work is about as effective as a Keystone Kops operation. Hardcore fans will recognize some of the faces and one hilarious theme song moment almost makes up for the films missteps. But what fuels I Want to Believe is the potent chemistry between Duchovny and Anderson anything but dormant after all these years. The writers know these characters -- the believer seeking the truth no matter how outlandish; the religious skeptic with her own rock-hard belief in science -- and the actors step into their roles without missing a beat. Theres a delightful amount canoodling between Mulder and Scully in I Want to Believe -- I knew those two were fooling around all these years -- and its a lot of fun to watch. Sadly their behavior only points out that the XF writers as pig-headed as Mulder shouldnt have avoided the inevitable for so long. They probably shouldnt have waited so long to make this film either. But at least I Want to Believe provides a welcome reminder of what made Carters franchise a pop-culture gem. Cast David Duchovny Gillian Anderson Amanda Peet Billy Connolly Alvin Xzibit Joiner.

Too bad its just the plot of a trashy horror flick. You want the truth? Ill give you the truth. The truth is The X-Files I Want to Believe is an atmospheric but disappointing bundle of cliches. It brings back David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson as FBI agents Mulder and Scully he the sardonic believer of extraterrestrials and paranormal forces she the pale scientist-skeptic and it reunites them with creator Chris Carter who co-wrote the script (with X-Files scribe Frank Spotnitz) and directs. The truth is it should be a better movie. It has no business being this stupid lackadaisical and schlocky. I realize that the original show ran on Fox a long time from 1993 to 2002 and broadcast episodes of wide-ranging quality including a few that even hardcore X-philes might term ""schlocky."" Remember the one with the Ecuadorian sewer cats? But the truth is the plot of this film is stupider. It opens with some promise with a snappily edited sequence showing a womans assault and abduction in the hills of West Virginia intercut with search and discovery in the snow and ice nearby. Soon after we meet our favorite deadpan investigators who havent actually worked for the FBI since Scully quit the biz and Mulder went on the lam thanks to a complicated story arc that wrapped up the series. The truth is Scullys been working as a pediatric specialist for a Catholic hospital of the 1950s flying-nuns variety. Mulders been shacked up at Scullys house growing a shaggy beard and doing A Beautiful Mind on newspaper clippings. As ever they call one another by their surnames but they are clearly and indubitably still Together as in Sexually which has been a matter of burning interest to X-philes over the years. (The progression from first kiss to implied off-screen baby-making was dissected with the meticulous attention of an alien autopsy.) The truth is theyre boring now. They were more fun back when they were frustrated and forced to express undying eros in more noble and platonically tender ways -- for instance rescuing each other from slime-a-licious alien pathogens. You might recall that from the first X-Files movie subtitled Fight the Future which resembled a two-part mythology-soaked episode rather than a stand-alone feature that non-X-File-fanatics could watch and enjoy -- or barring that understand. Carter and company have corrected this error by making a film that fans and nonfans alike can dislike equally. The truth is I Want to Believe does stand on its own. The plot which I cant spoil without causing black helicopters to swoop into my backyard involves that first missing woman and then another missing woman plus a creepy priest with Jerry Garcia hair (Billy Connolly) who sexually abused 37 altar boys and now has visions of the first victim. These visions prompt FBI stalwart Dakota Whitney (Amanda Peet) to lure Mulder out of hiding and onto the case. None of the film has anything to do with government conspiracies or E.T.s or Dec. 22 2012 -- the date when according to The X-Files aliens are scheduled to colonize Earth. The truth is the movie pays lip service to the shows central theme -- the tension between faith and skepticism -- but doesnt get much beyond a soapy hospital subplot and the supernatural trappings of a disgraced priest. Can God speak to a pedophile -- through him even? Now thats an interesting serious Jesuitical question but its asked on the cusp of a hack-gothic Bruno Mattei plot twist so loony and lurid that I burst out laughing.

(Diyah Pera) Email|Print|Single Page| Text size - + By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / July 25 2008 We may not see it often but Gillian Anderson has a wonderful face for movies. Its long with big features that dont give a lot away. She would have been a huge star in the 1930s and 40s when the good screenplays had snap and a half-awake director would have made the most of her smolder and intelligence. Instead her career has been bound up in one way or another with Dana Scully the FBI agent whom Anderson has been playing on ""The X-Files"" since the early 1990s.Anderson gave a devastatingly seductive performance eight years ago as Lily Bart in ""The House of Mirth"" and it promised a long bright life after the show. Oh well. Now shes back again as Scully a mystery that seems beyond even her sleuthing. ""The X-Files I Want to Believe"" a second film based on the show requires her to say things like ""A young agents life is at stake"" ""Its over"" and ""Im taking a chance on a radical and extremely painful medical procedure."" Dana so is the audience.The movie reunites Anderson and David Duchovny who seems a little happier to be playing Fox Mulder again. He gets to fight off attack dogs get shot with a tranquilizer and watch people fall down elevator shafts. Duchovnys seemingly sleep-deprived humor makes sense as Mulder a kook vaguely embarrassed by his kookiness. But you have to wonder whether he and Anderson will be consigned to live on as the Shatner-Nimoy of their generation.The shows creator Chris Carter directed and co-wrote ""I Want to Believe"" but this time doesnt have the duo do anything other worldly. Theyre not chasing aliens just leads on a missing FBI agent. Scully has quit the bureau to practice medicine full time. Mulder appears to have quit to practice growing the Unabombers beard. But the FBI - represented by Amanda Peet and rapper/ride-pimper Xzibit naturally - needs them. The agency has been relying on the hunches of a clairvoyant pedophile priest played by an under-the-top Billy Connolly to catch a predator. The priest might be connected to the victim. He may have known her captors. He might want to see someone about his bleeding eyes.Regardless if thats all I had to go on Mulder and Scullys believer-skeptic routine might start looking pretty good to me too.Carter and co-writer Frank Spotnitz have stapled together an arbitrary plot out of yesterdays news (cancer Russians gay marriage stem cells clergy sex abuse) in a way that drags us back to the lousy thrillers of both the 1980s and last spring. I thought Aprils ""88 Minutes"" with its steaming pile of Pacino would be the last time a movie would cook up a homosexual nutjob. Oops. ""I Want to Believe"" comes up with two.The movie is less like an episode of ""The X-Files"" and more like the trashiest installment ever of ""Law amp; Order SVU."" Benson and Stabler have seen some loony stuff but nothing this sick. And certainly Benson has never brought the house down as Scully does by surveying a crime scene and saying ""Ive got work to do here."" Even the putdown of our current president is out of line. George W. Bush may be responsible for a lot of messes but this movies not one of them.The whole thing feels like atonement for the pretensions and preposterous dead ends of the last ""X-Files"" movie and the shows diminished final seasons. ""I Want to Believe"" isnt so much for the fans who will always have reruns or the actors who will always have residuals but for Carter himself who like George Lucas seems unduly obsessed with his signature franchise well past its actual value.The truth is indeed still out there. And when Carter finds it may he heed its wisdom Let go.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/movienation.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 24 2008 605 PM Close Encounters of the Woo-Woo Kind Mulder and Scully reunite in The X-Files I Want To Believe. By Dana Stevens Also in Slate Juliet Lapidos argues that the best X-Files episodes were the ones without aliens. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson in The X-Files I Want To Believe Heres an alternate subtitle for the new X-Files movie The X-Files I Want To Believe (20th Century Fox) I Want To Care. I know that the long-running Fox TV series attracted a passionate following; some of my smartest friends were addicts. For a good chunk of the 90s liking The X-Files was a hip thing to do and the show became the object of some technological firsts the first modern TV series to be released on DVD and arguably the first to build a fan base through the newfangled Internet. But the actual show always bored me stiff those murky Vancouver locations the earnest debates about faith and science the dependable-as-clockwork appearance of something gross right before the first commercial. Most boring of all was the shows ""deep mythology"" the multiseason story arc about an alien invasion covered up by decades of governmental conspiracy (trying to care trying ... failing). Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Unlike the first X-Files movie released in 1998 at the height of the shows success I Want To Believe almost completely ignores the deep mythology. Its the big-screen version of the series stand-alone ""monster of the week"" episodes that alternated with the development of the mythic arc. First a creepy paranormal-seeming phenomenon stumps the FBI; then they call in special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) to investigate; and in the end the most far-out explanation imaginable turns out to be the correct one confirming the merits of Mulders woo-woo belief system over Scullys skeptical one. Advertisement In the six years since weve seen them both Mulder and Scully have left the agency. Shes a pediatric surgeon at a Catholic hospital; hes a reclusive conspiracy theorist holed up in his home office clipping newspaper articles about freak occurrences. But the disappearance of an FBI agent unites them in an investigation that has a psychic angle A defrocked pedophile priest played by Scottish comic Billy Connolly claims to be experiencing visions of the missing woman. The nefarious plot behind the agents abduction is so far-fetched Im itching to spoil it. But Ill limit myself to observing that if ever Im dying of a rare brain disease I hope my surgeon wont go home and frantically Google treatment options as Scully does at one key moment. (Couldnt she at least log on to Medscape?) The problem with the movies semisupernatural crime plot though isnt that the resolution is completely outlandish; its that the outlandishness is insufficiently grounded in pseudoscience. If youre going to posit stuff this crazy youd better have some solid-sounding bullshit to back it up. But plenty of viewers will be more or less indifferent to the question of whos dismembering whom. Theres a whole subset of X-Philes known as shippers who pore over the minutiae of every episode for evidence of an emerging relationship between Mulder and Scully. (Theyre opposed by the Noromos who hold that there should be ""no romance"" between the two.) The shows creator Chris Carter who co-wrote and directed I Want To Believe seems to be trying to please both sides at once by putting in a romantic angle but keeping it as juiceless as possible. In the six years since we last saw them the couple has gone from chaste near-kisses (and a child conceived through mysterious means) to a comfortable if eccentric union. Theyre not married (as Scully points out irritably to one character who calls Mulder her husband) but they appear to be living together in secret perhaps to protect Mulder from his enemies. Youd think that Carter a master of the long-term narrative tease would understand the difference between the delicious tension of Mulder and Scully not knowing what they are to each other and the flat-out annoyance of an audience left in the dark as to their status. In a scene at least an hour into the movie as Scully lies in bed pondering the case Mulders head suddenly pops up behind her shoulder causing an audiencewide ""Wha?"" After nine years of episodes in which a shoulder pat constituted major erotica seeing these two casually chatting in bed (He even makes a wan offer of sex Which she amiably refuses) is a major letdown. Did we really just fast-forward through six years of long-deferred passion to arrive at boringly consummated couplehood? For all this movies deficits Duchovny and Anderson still look and sound great together. A lot more fun should have been had with a pair whose pillow talk consists of lines like ""I forgot to mention the pathology reports came back on that severed arm."" Gloomy lapsed Catholics also abound in Brideshead Revisited(Miramax)--not pedophile priests but the dissipated members of the Marchmain family Anglo-Catholic aristocrats whose high style and staggering country estate seduce upper-middle-class aspiring artist Charles Ryder (Matthew Goode) in the period between world wars. Julian Jarrolds adaptation of the Evelyn Waugh novel is the first feature-length version of the story and it cant help but labor under the burden of the 1982 adaptation for Granada television which starred Jeremy Irons and remains a monument to the British genius for long-form TV. Im not quite of a mind with Slates Troy Patterson in finding the new movie ""vomitously stupid""; rather its a gorgeous lulling thoroughly unnecessary exercise in high-minded Anglophilia. In compressing the sprawling story screenwriter Andrew Davies has excised most of Waughs lyricism and all of his wit with the result that the characters spend a great deal of time staring significantly at one another while the audience stares at their clothes. The well-dressed starers include Ben Whishaw as the Marchmains dissolute middle son Sebastian; Hayley Atwell as his troubled sister Julia; and Emma Thompson as the familys rigid matriarch. Atwell looks luscious and Thompson does her best with an unfairly caricatured role but the best thing I took away from this Brideshead was a reminder scribbled at the bottom of my notes ""Rent the miniseries.""

Instead they come from Russia a band of demented medicos descended on West Virginia to participate in some freaky Frankenstein shenanigans - and thats too bad. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) still has that old UFO poster on his wall though its a wall in his house in the middle of nowhere. Hes a recluse with a beard and bitter memories in mopey exile retired from his job as an expert on paranormal phenomena at the FBI. So the plot of Chris Carters second film spun off of the hit cult TV show is decidedly terrestrial and grim and unpleasant too. A convoluted unconvincing mishmash of hot-button social issues - stem cell research Catholic church sexual-abuse scandals pedophilia gay marriage organ harvesting - The X-Files I Want to Believe reunites Mulder with Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) his pretty pragmatic partner of all nine TV seasons. Its been six years since the series signed off 10 since the first film. While Mulder seems to be doing nothing now but clipping articles out of newspapers Scully has gone to work at Our Lady of Sorrows Hospital - shes a surgeon full of angst and self-doubt over how to treat a young boy with a rare and seemingly fatal brain disease. Enter Father Joe (Billy Connolly) a defrocked priest with claims of psychic abilities. Two hard-nosed skeptical FBI-ers - Dakota Whitney (a no-nonsense Amanda Peet) and Mosley Drummy (Alvin ""Xzibit"" Joiner) - arent sure what to make of this long-haired noxious gent but they enlist Father Joes services anyway when a fellow agent goes missing. And when he leads the search party onto a snowy field drops to his knees and comes up with a severed arm - well its time to get Mulder over here to check out this Father Joe and see if hes for real. Gloomy and serpentine with a pointless chase sequence and a couple of big revelations about what Mulder and Scully have been up to on a personal level The X-Files I Want to Believe will make believers of no one whos not already a diehard X-phile. Duchovny whos moved on to offbeat indie work (playing a randy cad in Showtimes Californication) looks alternately peeved and vexed and shrouded in melancholy for most of the film. Anderson whos turned Brit in a number of TV series and films including Bleak House and The Last King of Scotland is compelling in her white lab coat and surgical scrubs and she brings some real tenderness to her tete-a-tetes with Mulder. Her characters doubts about ESP and the paranormal linger still but so does Scullys attachment to Mulder - and her faith in him. Faith as the title suggests is the operative theme in The X-Files I Want to Believe. But X-Files creator Carter throws out such a hodgepodge of stalker and serial killer cliches dotting the landscape with black crows and snarling dogs and moves the action along in such stop-and-start bursts that whatever point hes trying to get at remains puzzling vague and well unbelievable.

"X-Files I Want to Believe --2 stars - Chicago Tribune Arts amp; Entertainment Arts amp; Entertainment X-Files I Want to Believe --2 stars Michael PhillipsTribune staff reporter Privacy Policy Movie stardom isnt in the eye of the beholder its in the percentages demanded and received by the movie star. Were talking about a state of fiscal grace not a state of glamor or mystique.By that measure Gillian Anderson is not a movie star. Yet shes world-famous as FBI agent Dana Scully. Shes also a marvelous coolly soulful actress (choice for example in a too-small role in ""The Last King of Scotland""). Her range may not be limitless--shes best murmuring in close-up whether dealing with medical issues or spiritual ones--but her dramatic instincts are very stealthy indeed.Anderson almost makes the new ""X-Files"" film subtitled ""I Want to Believe"" something to believe in. The new feature is like a protracted passably engaging episode of the deliciously paranoiac series that began in 1993 and wrapped in 2002. A decade ago series creator Chris Carter and his stars Anderson and top-billed David Duchovny got together for their first spinoff feature (""The X-Files Fight the Future"") which elaborated on the shows UFO abduction mythology. ""The X-Files I Want to Believe"" has no UFOs in it and it relies less on the audiences collective knowledge of the series and more on its own stand-alone storytelling skills. Yet the story is both a muddle and a drag having to do with stem cell research and regeneration and missing limbs and a fraught psychic and thats enough detail for the purposes of this review. The film will work I suspect about the same with die-hard series fans as it does with newbies. Which is to say Fans and newcomers alike will find it just OK.There are some comforts amid the disappointment. The second we see that first locator in the lower left-hand corner of the screen reading ""Somerset West Virginia"" ""X-Files"" geeks know that were looking at British Columbia where the first five years of the series was shot. The second Scully now a doctor working with children shows up at Mulders crazy-loner hide-out where he spends his days clipping newspaper accounts of paranormal activity and watching his Grizzly Adams beard grow you know theyre about to dive back into the Truth and the paranoia and the things they cannot rationally explain. Billy Connolly plays the psychic a pedophile priest leading the feds to the solution of the case of a missing FBI agent. Amanda Peet talks tough as the agent spearheading the hunt though the way she reads the line ""Fox Mulder I believe?""--who has ever introduced herself to anyone that way?--you sense shes going to be straining in every scene for that deadpan minimalist cool that comes so naturally to Duchovny and Anderson. The surprise is the films lack of visual distinction. The best of the series episodes looked sleek and imposingly atmospheric. By design director Carter and cinematographer Bill Roe favor a rougher less shiny approach but Carters handling of the action sequences is oddly lackluster. Theres a moment when Duchovny interrupts some evil lab work being conducted by a bunch of Russians and its a blown opportunity for suspense in every respect.On some level too I suppose I miss the UFO business. Plenty of terrific episodes of the ""X-Files"" series had nothing to do with aliens but tell me this How did "" Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" end up with all the UFO fodder while ""The X-Files I Want to Believe"" went in a comparatively mundane direction?mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating PG-13 (for violent and disturbing content and thematic material) Running time 144Opening 1201 a.m. FridayStarring David Duchovny (Fox Mulder); Gillian Anderson (Dana Scully); Amanda Peet (Dakota Whitney); Billy Connolly (Father Joseph Crissman); Alvin ""XZIBIT"" Joiner (Agent Mosley Drummy); Callum Keith Rennie (Janke Dacyshyn); Adam Godley (Father Ybarra); Fagin Woodcock (Franz Tomczeszyn)Directed by Chris Carter; written and produced by Frank Spotnitz and Carter; photographed by Bill Roe; edited by Richard A.

Thats long been the unwritten credo of The X-Files; what made the television show so fascinating was the various forms faith could take. For FBI Agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) the abduction of his sister by aliens shaped his belief in the paranormal the extra-terrestrial the fantastic explanation - faith that the truth was out there. For his partner Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) originally a skeptic faith took a more traditional route - while her standing in the Catholic Church waxed and waned over the years it was always a part of her life and character. The X-Files I Want to Believe the second big-screen version of the show requires faith on the part of fans - faith that the chemistry between Duchovny and Anderson is enough to carry a film faith that the story will eventually have that signature X-Files twist faith that the movie is worth the wait. Short answers Pretty much; yes though late in the game; and . . . maybe. Its all in the eye of the beholder. If you are a fan of the show this is a must-see movie simply because it touches on enough of the grace notes the show offered weekly to take you back to the days when Mulder and Scully were shining their flashlights into the darkness. If youre not then I Want to Believe is a rather workaday thriller with some particularly creepy touches. Its been six years since The X-Files left the air and in the film the same amount of time has passed. It opens with an army of FBI agents canvassing a snowy icy field led by a hermit-looking fellow with horn-rimmed glasses. Thats Father Joe (Billy Connolly) a priest who claims to have received visions that will lead them to a missing agent. The search is inter-cut with what happened to the agent at least at first. In fine X-Files fashion he finds something all right. Not the agent but something that will deepen the mystery. Cue Scully now working as a doctor in a Catholic hospital trying to figure out a way to treat a little boy with an incurable disease. The FBI needs to find Mulder - once the FBIs go-to agent for paranormal cases - so it contacts her. Soon she shows up at what looks like an abandoned farmhouse. Of course it does have an inhabitant - Mulder bearded looking a little crazed by his isolation. Its not self-imposed. Scully reminds Mulder that hes wanted by the FBI but that the bureau is willing to forgive and forget if hell help with this case. And after the requisite hemming and hawing theyre off. Fans of The X-Files typically fall into one of two categories You like the over-arching ""mythology"" stories or the stand-alone monster-of-the-week episodes. So its a curious choice Chris Carter the creator of the show and the director and co-writer of the film makes here. He goes in neither direction at least not fully. I Want to Believe is basically a stand-alone episode stretched to almost two hours. But the crimes being committed here arent supernatural. Its the solving of them that is. An X-Files touch - Father Joe isnt just a priest. Hes a convicted pedophile. Which leads to the core question of the film Would God speak through such a man? Duchovny and Anderson fall immediately back into the X-Files groove with Mulder the smart-aleck and Scully the eye-roller. The nature of their relationship is both clarified and further muddied if that makes any sense (it doesnt really). Whatever the case as Mulder tells another agent hes only half of the team and its true. For The X-Files to work in any form Mulder and Scully have to work together testing each other and themselves. But the middle of the movie drags as Mulder and Scully once again sort out whether they can continue the case. Things pick up when they make their decision naturally though once we get into true X-Files territory - nothing about that revealed here sorry - it feels rushed tacked on. We realize that Carter has spent too much time with Mulder and Scullys crises of faith and not enough time creeping us out. And yet when its doing its X-Files thing the movie makes you long for the glory days of the show. The ingredients are still there for what made people love the series in the first place. But are they strong enough to justify another film to anchor a franchise? The evidence is somewhat spotty here but like most fans I want to believe.

Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME Early in The X Files I Want to Believe Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) long ago demobbed from the FBI are back in the Bureaus headquarters waiting outside a closed door to take a meeting with their former colleagues. They glance at a wall portrait of the President ... and for a moment we hear the first six notes of the whistled theme that cued 90s TV watchers to the weekly spookiness of The X Files. Hmmm. Could George W. Bush be an alien -- or an alien abductee? A yes to either question would explain so much. On the other side of the door is a photo of J. Edgar Hoover. Staring at it Mulder and Scully just shrug but thats unfair to the FBIs snoop extraordinaire the vicar of voyeurs the patron saint of the TV shows belief that under every bed in every closet or out in a pumpkin patch is something very scary that could bring America to its knees. And even if it doesnt its worth tracking down keeping in a locked drawer. Knowledge is power and belief in the dark side spurs you to gain that knowledge. The TV show which ran from 1993 to 2002 and for its first five seasons or so artfully explored all crevasses of paranormal fiction -- psy-fi -- could have had Bush and Hoover as its patron saints its Janus heads. They expressed the shows continuing contradictory catchphrases ""I Want to Believe"" and ""Trust No One."" Each Sunday night at nine the series would juggle the concepts of blind faith (the need to find meaning and pattern in the random events of the universe) and paranoia (which as any neurotic would tell you is just common sense accompanied by theremin music). Hip and weird and reveling in the emotional voyeurism at the heart of any detective show The X Files spanned the Bill Clinton Era -- or roughly the time between the two attacks on the World Trade Center -- when Americas political and social life was so placid that we had to invent our own monsters. Then 9/11 exploded in our faces and the horror shows were on the nightly news. In the new movie directed by X Files creator Chris Carter and written by Carter and series producer Frank Spotnitz Mulder and Scully are back but so much has changed that they seem the aliens. For an obvious start the stars are older. Anderson 25 when the show premiered will hit 40 next month two days after Duchovny turns 48. In the new movie hes bearded and wasted-looking her profile is more hawklike; and the camera traces the lines the intervening years have written on their faces with the odd intensity of Nicholas Cage running his finger over the route on an ancient map in National Treasure. A subtler anachronism is the seriousness with which Mulder and Scully take their work and themselves. On TV Duchovny settled quickly into his role as an obsessive plodder; Andersons gravity served as a rebuke to all the actresses her age who spoke in baby talk and aspired to nothing higher than Baywatch. The movie continues that dark quiet tone which means that todays moviegoers will have to forgo expectations of wisecracking heroes and snarling psychopaths and to take seriously a couple of anguished folks who look and behave with the tired tenseness of anchors on C-SPAN. Which is why this weekend perhaps four times as many moviegoers will take in The Dark Knight on its second weekend as will see Mulder and Scully on their first date in six years. Sins of the Fathers A female agent has been murdered and her colleague Dakota Whitney (Amanda Peet) has enlisted Mulder and Scully to help her find the killer. One clue comes from visions of the murder claimed by Father Joe (Billy Connolly) a Catholic priest who had been convicted of sexually abusing dozens of altar boys decades before. In line with their old TV selves Mulder is sympathetic to the mans assertions Skully skeptical. ""Do you believe him?"" an agent (rapper Alvin ""Xzibit"" Joiner) dismissively asks Mulder who replies ""Lets say I wanna believe.""

If the first ""X-Files"" movie landed in the midst of the TV shows run and near the height of its popularity the second -- far more modest in scope and ambition -- comes six years after the program signed off. Both however share a common trait Namely neither would qualify as a better-than-average episode of the series. Director/franchise creator Chris Carter gives devoted fans plenty of small moments to swoon over but the appeal should be limited beyond those fervent loyalists. So while the opening should be reasonably robust this remains a movie primarily reserved for those wanting to believe in it. A few niggling details -- including Carters lawsuit against 20th Century Fox -- had to be resolved before the movie could happen. Nevertheless the passage of time did wonders for ""Sex and the City"" and pent-up demand will doubtless prompt initial whoops and hollers here. Because the series arcane alien-invasion mythology became increasingly impenetrable in the latter stages theres also something to be said for returning to basics. The execution though is another matter. Released amid the kind of security normally reserved for nuclear launch codes (and no spoilers here) the plot is initiated largely by a baffling missing-persons case that results in former FBI agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) being summoned from professional exile. Mulder of course was once assigned to investigate unexplained cases paired with skeptical partner/medical doctor Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). Pressed back into service they interact mostly with two existing agents (Amanda Peet and rapper Alvin ""Xzibit"" Joiner) and a fallen priest (Billy Connolly) who may be experiencing psychic visions. Moving rapidly into the main story Carter (who also wrote and produced with longtime collaborator Frank Spotnitz) still grasps the inherent spookiness of things that go bump in the night -- or in this particular setting in vast white fields of snow where much of the action transpires. The problem is that the mystery isnt as compelling or satisfying as it should be and a ""B"" arc involving Scully separates the central duo at times without adding much to the narrative. Indeed when Peets character offhandedly references some of Mulders past adventures its hard not to wish you were watching one of them. First glimpsed with a slightly rabbinical beard Duchovny hasnt lost his facility for delivering wisecracks and Anderson can rattle off medical gibberish with the best of them. As for their chemistry history has exacted something of a toll not that it will matter much to those who once sighed breathlessly whenever the two so much as brushed fingertips. Never ones to miss an opportunity the brass at Fox were savvy to push for the movie now -- and in a package that minimizes financial risk by eschewing pyrotechnics to focus on the shows creepy essence. (As always composer Mark Snows score goes a long way toward making a walk to the mailbox seem fraught with peril.) Still the warming glow of nostalgia only goes so far with ones level of forgiveness likely dictated by where they reside along the ""X-Files"" fan continuum -- ranging from those who can rattle off the Cigarette-Smoking Mans personal data to casual viewers of a few episodes. At either end of the spectrum though in searching for a great ""X-Files"" movie that truth remains out there. (Editors note Lowry is the author of two 1990s companion guides to ""The X-Files."")
