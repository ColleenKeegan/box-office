Ayer has done the macho police thing before He wrote the momentous Training Day (2001) in which a very angry Denzel Washington played a crooked cop and he wrote and directed the problematic-but-compelling Harsh Times (2005) in which an even angrier Christian Bale played a crooked vet trying to become a cop. The characters in End of Watch match the ones in those films for sheer jacked-up explosiveness but this time the boys in blue are never actually dirty  though they are rowdy arrogant and occasionally even stupid. Gone are the moral complications and ethical gray areas of Ayers earlier work Ably played by Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena young partners Brian Taylor and Mike Zavala always stand on the right side of the law in between bouts of jawing at each other or talking about their girls. And in a movie world where cops are always expected to be compromised in some way these guys are refreshingly old-fashioned. Perhaps needless to say its that do-the-right-thing attitude that causes our heroes some trouble as they get a little too in the way of a Mexican drug cartel thats taken foothold in the slums of Los Angeles. But who can blame them when the cartel is doing inexplicably evil things like chopping people up and leaving their body parts rotting in pools of blood and filth in abandoned buildings? Along the way we also get a somewhat-cloying look into the personal lives of our cop-heroes including Taylors budding romance with a young scientist (a subplot that would have been insufferable were it not for Anna Kendricks winning presence). The one newish twist here is that Taylor is also in school and hes shooting his life as a cop for a film class which means that theres a lot of energy expended to establish the POV style of the film. Not only is Taylor repeatedly seen holding reaching for or situating a camera but the gangsters are going around recording their exploits as well it turns out. (Are they all in the same class?) All in all the gimmick feels like a bit of a waste and a distraction since theres plenty in the film that clearly wasnt shot by one of these narratively established cameras. Interestingly though they too have cameras the film never seeks to understand its villains; they remain looming unknowable monstrous presences even in their rare intimate moments. Luckily for most of the movies running time you wont have a chance to be distracted because End of Watch is often dizzyingly intense. Thats not because Ayer is a great action director  hes serviceable at best  but because he has a genuine feel for the equal-opportunity macho bluster of the streets (both the cops and the criminals front like nobodys business) and for his attention to the details of police work. That together with the films faux-doc style and its grimy locales might suggest that the director is working some kind of neorealist angle here. But as End of Watch descends ever deeper into outrageous depravity as the cops discover ever more horrific crimes and as the nauseating sense gathers that theyre rapidly approaching some truly awful denouement you begin to realize that this is more a descent into Hell than it is a realistic portrait of criminality today. But Ayer doesnt quite have the sensibility to turn the whole thing into a metaphor. His film lacks the epic scale and visual poetry of a Michael Mann movie even though it occasionally recalls some of Manns work. True some will find all this a bit too cartoonish  catastrophic unthinkable evil meets cops so good that they get reprimanded by their superiors for not shooting suspects  but were in capable hands here. Ayer and his cast appear to have so convincingly nailed the way these characters talk and act that you might not even notice the film slipping from workaday grit into out-and-out myth. -- Bilge Ebiri Advertisement Top 10 Movies Star Trek Beyond The Secret Life of Pets Ghostbusters Lights Out Ice Age Collision Course Finding Dory The Legend of Tarzan Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates Hillarys America The Secret History of the Democratic Party The Infiltrator Advertising On The Set of Jill Soloways I Love Dick The Great British Baking Show Recap Rough Puff Outcast Recap Sympathy For the Devil The Great British Baking Show Recap Lady Fingers TV Review BoJack Horseman Gucci Mane Is Better Than Hes Been in Years Absolutely Fabulous The Movie Is Only Semi-Fab Copyright (c) 2016 New York Media LLC.

Two LAPD officers patrol dangerous streets together. Director David Ayer (149). R strong violence and disturbing images language drugs. Area theaters. I cant fairly say whether David Ayers outstanding ""End of Watch"" offers an accurate depiction of life as a police officer. But its hard to imagine a more gripping tribute to those who regularly put their lives on the line for the rest of us. Ayer is best known for writing ""Training Day"" another ultra-intense police drama. But here as both writer and director he slows down the pace eschewing typical movie patterns in order to recreate the rhythms of reality. Our heroes -- and feel free to take the word literally -- are LAPD cops Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Zavala (Michael Pena). You might not catch their names though since they usually call each other ""partner."" Indeed their bond is evident from the start as they cruise around South Central L.A. sharing secrets and mocking their own cultural differences with fraternal ease. Theyre too young to be jaded but even as they joke their eyes are searching the streets looking for trouble. They find it in burning buildings housing projects and especially the hideouts of a vicious cartel. But instead of setting up conflict and pushing us towards a resolution Ayer cruises around too. Things happen then they dont and on and on. Its an unusual and excruciatingly effective technique. The actors both excellent get right into Ayers groove. So by the time we arrive at the unsparing climax we really know and care about these guys. As a result were far more invested in their fates than we would normally be. There are a couple of potholes that could have been avoided like a totally unnecessary found-footage gimmick. More troublesome is the cartoonish portrayal of the Mexican gang members a glaring flaw in such an otherwise intelligent film. If Ayer had taken as much care with his bad guys as he does with his leads (and their deftly sketched wives and colleagues played by Anna Kendrick America Ferrera and Frank Grillo among others) he might have crafted a seamless picture. Although as his leads perpetually learn nothing is ever perfect. No matter how hard you work to make it so.

"End of Watch review Cinematographers officers on patrol - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Cinematographers and officers on patrol in End of Watch  1/2September 20 2012|Michael Phillips | Movie criticWriter-director David Ayer has described his new film ""End of Watch"" as akin to ""watching YouTube -- where something in your mind tells you this is real. This film is like YouTube meets Training Day in a lot of ways."" (Ayer wrote ""Training Day"" which won Denzel Washington an Oscar for his role as a dirty LAPD detective.) So What does that YouTube comparison mean exactly?It means Ayer shoots his movie as if compiled from a mixture of ""Cops""-style surveillance footage shot on ""dash-cams"" inside the patrol car; video shot by the character played by Jake Gyllenhaal (who were told early on is enrolled in a film class as part of his continuing education); and surreptitious chest-level video. Early on the officers played by Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena affix little spy cams to their uniforms. Theyre not the only documentarians on the streets of South Central LA.Key gang-banging adversaries encountered by the cops carry their own cameras and keep nosing in on tense bloody acts of revenge. Other flashy perspectives come more or less out of nowhere from no particular perspective as if Ayer was hired as the unseen tagalong videographer for the latest drive-by. The footage swivels between color and black and white.Its a full load of self-conscious faux realism for a relatively straightforward outline. Officers Taylor (Gyllenhaal) and Zavala (Pena) are good friends and valiant protectors of the people though Gyllenhaals opening voice-over (""I am fate with a badge and gun"") indicates that Ayer may forever have one foot in prose and the other in pulp poetry. ""End of Watch"" proceeds episodically with Taylor and Zavala crisscrossing paths with an encroaching drug cartel and its street soldiers. Many dead bodies and grisly sights later amid some fairly effective suspense sequences weve gotten to know a bit about Zavalas marriage (""I went to prom and got married a week later"") and the horn-dog Taylors romance with the newfound love of his life played by Anna Kendrick.Ayer most recently directed the overpacked LAPD drama ""Street Kings"" (2008) and ""End of Watch"" is a leaner more compelling affair. No dirty cops this time no elaborate conspiracies. Gyllenhaal and Pena are after a lived-in camaraderie and a street-level realism. Pena especially succeeds; you buy him every second.The drawback of the films visual approach however is a considerable one. The relentless first-person shooting in ""End of Watch"" -- figurative and literal -- is less about YouTube factuality than it is about Xbox gaming reconfigured for the movies. (Its omnipresent this approach and its not going away ""Dredd 3D"" would be nothing without it and in fact isnt much with it.) Ayer has talent. He knows how to keep your guts in a knot. For many thatll be enough.mjphillipstribune.comEnd of Watch -- 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating R (for strong violence some disturbing images pervasive language including sexual references and some drug use)Running time 149Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesDavid Ayer gives cop genre new twist with End of WatchSeptember 21 2012End of Watch returns to theaters Open Road to bring back...November 30 2012Thrills chills dramatic films dominate fall seasonAugust 29 2012Sam Worthington in talks for Ayers Ten Actor would team...July 23 20125 reasons why Toronto is the film fest that mattersSeptember 8 2005Find More Stories AboutJake GyllenhaalTraining DayDavid AyerTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-09-20/entertainment/sc-mov-0918-end-of-watch-20120920_1_david-ayer-zavala-drug-cartel,200,endofwatch2,endofwatch,chicagotribune

The Hurt Locker performed that service for servicemen; it said that soldiers who defused bombs in Baghdad were risking their lives to save those of Iraqis. Ben Afflecks Argo a hit at the Toronto Film Festival finds heroism and actual Intelligence in a CIA officer. Now in End of Watch writer-director David Ayer proposes that the policeman on the South Los Angeles detail are truly L.A.s finest -- seraphic souls who guard the City of Angels. Next thing you know somebody will make a movie about an honest politician. (Oops. Coming right up Steven Spielbergs Lincoln.) Over the last dozen years Ayer has spent as much time with L.A. cops as Peter Jackson has with Hobbits. Ayers scripts for Training Day and Dark Blue ripped the medals off the puffed-up chests of venal policemen. S.W.A.T. which he wrote and Street Kings which he directed from a James Ellroy story provided a mix of good cops and bad ones to cheer or hiss. (Another Ayer film Harsh Times focused on the felonious civilians of South Central.) He must have thought that the men and women who court death as regularly as white-collar workers check their Facebook pages deserved a portrait that was more Norman Rockwell less Francis Bacon. So in tribute or retribution he made End of Watch the alternately engrossing and annoying police procedural that Ayer dedicates to ""all those who fight evil so that we may not know it."" (READ Dayid Ayer on Reinventing the Cop Genre) We spend three months in a patrol car with Officers Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Pena). ""I am Fate with a badge and a gun"" Brian declares in the opening voiceover sounding like the graduate student he is in his scant spare time. With nerve to match his ambition Brian will walk fearlessly into any strange house -- in this movie every abode is deadly or haunted -- and when he unearths a cache of drugs or money never considers taking some to finance his education. His partner and best friend Mike is as expertly comic at imitating Anglo voices as Brian is at speaking Spanglish during their police-car banter but a homebody who married his high school sweetheart Gabby (Natalie Martinez). Brian with a history of three-night stands may have finally found Ms. Right in the perky Janet (Anna Kendrick). All four are the kindest bravest warmest most wonderful human beings youve ever known in your life. (READ Corlisss review of David Ayers Street Kings) Some movies about L.A. cops like last years Rampart (also from an Ellroy story) float the notion that an officer needs to be crazy or corrupt to survive and thrive in a hellish job. End of Watch argues that the boys in blue can have hearts of gold. No question that Brian and Mike are as noble as the local malefactors are monstrous. Need clues to how egregious the movies villains are? Theyre named Demon (Richard Cabral) Wicked (Diamonique) and Big Evil (Maurice Compte). At rest they lounge in snarling decadence; when agitated they break the all-time record for use of the f-word. Underlings of a Mexican drug cartel they risk exposure when our heroes find a stash of coke and some elaborate hardware. ""Look"" Mike says holding a silver-encrusted rifle ""Liberaces AK[-47]."" Thats not a great collar; its an intimation of mortality. As a federal agent warns the cops theyve pulled the tail of a snake that will come back to bite them. (READ Corlisss review of Rampart) The ethical point of view has its inspirational and novelty value but the aesthetic POV -- the pretense that most of what we see is ""found footage"" -- borders on the ludicrous. Brian justifies his incessant carrying of a camera by saying hes doing a project for grad school. Viewers at first may sigh and indulge this overused strategy with a conditional OK. But Ayer and cinematographer Roman Vasyanov (in his first feature made outside his native Russia) go nuts with the camerabatics shattering the visual lexicon of film and replacing it with anarchy. A simple car conversation is shot from six different angles including an upward view of crotches. Apparently Brian has also preset cameras in the houses they enter or the residents wanted surveillance videos from floorboard level. And whos got an iPhone out during the big gunplay scenes? (Someone is shooting with the wrong instrument.) In a no-budget horror franchise like the Paranormal Activity films found footage can serve the purpose of a teasing minimalism while it applies an electric shock to the audience. But in a medium-budget cop drama like End of Watch the tactic fatally substitutes photo realism for fauxto realism. (READ Corliss on the Paranormal Activity films) Its a wonder the actors do good work here since in the more pensive scenes Ayer shoots them in microcosmic closeup; by the end of the film you will know Gyllenhaals face -- the mole above his lip every freckle and wen -- better than your own mirrored image. Yet he and Pena and Kendrick and Martinez not only get to show off their perfect teeth they manage to burrow into their characters to find behavioral nuances under the haloes. Granted any decision a good man makes has greater impact when his life could end with the turn of a doorknob. But the performances here are so sharp that viewers may wish End of Watch has been shot by someone who knew how to find the right point of view for a scene and leave it there -- say the anonymous auteur who shot Mitt Romneys ""47 percent"" speech with an utterly stationary camera. That deadpan expose not End of Watch is the most enthralling movie of the week.

Well maybe a few members of the force sat him down and had a quiet word because End of Watch is a gushing tribute to the boys in blue.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Brian a no-bullshit LAPD patrolman who cruises the suburban streets with his partner and closest friend Mike (Michael Pena). We follow these two jobbing officers as they bust a few crooks get into some close scrapes and end up on the wrong side of a psychotic Mexican drug cartel. In the meantime Brian woos and wins Janet (Anna Kendrick) while Mike wrestles with his wifes uncertainty about his life-threatening day job.Plenty about this that works. Gylenhaal and especially Pena seem completely at home in their roles the scenes where they simply drive around the neighbourhood engaging in prickly macho banter are the best in the film. But Ayer has made one crucial decision which all but sinks End of Watch this is a found footage movie. Beginning with Brians attempts to film his day-to-day experiences for a college project (the LAPD are supposed to be okay with this?) and continuing through the eyes of in-car cameras smartphones and surveillance footage the film is entirely put together from shaky grainy snippets of digital film. Its a distracting and occasionally laughable tactic a scene where the bad guys just happen to outline their evil plans to an iPhone camera feels totally ludicrous.Filmed differently End of Watch might have been an impressive piece of work sentimental and a touch overemphatic probably but it could also have been heartfelt and believable. As it is this cop drama is intermittently enjoyable but incredibly frustrating.

Its clearly not a work of art but I found myself really engaged with the characters caring what happened for them and getting genuinly excited/worried in certain sections.

By Cary Darlingdfw.comPosted 433pm on Thursday Sep. 27 2012 Thursday Sep. 27 2012 Thursday Sep. 20 2012 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram The ingredients in the cop drama End of Watch are as routine as a midday traffic stop Take two buddies in blue patrolling the hard streets of South Central Los Angeles; toss in some tatted-up foul-mouthed gun-toting gangstas; and sprinkle liberally with lots of shaky-cam visuals for that sense of cinematic urgency.Everyone has been served this many times.But director/writer David Ayer (who wrote the electric good-cop/bad-cop slap-o-rama Training Day back in 2001) makes it work. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena as the L.A. cops in question display an engaging camaraderie while Ayer leavens the expected venom and violence with an infectious sense of humor and a welcome sweetness.Brian (Gyllenhaal) and Mike (Pena) have developed the kind of bickering brotherhood that comes with being trapped in the same car together for several years. Their conversations ranging from crime to quinceneras are full of joshing and ribbing but underneath it all is a foundation of respect and love.Their world is inadvertently turned upside down when they stumble across a Mexican drug cartel trying to establish a foothold in an already gang-ridden Los Angeles neighborhood. Thats where the gun-toting gangstas come in.Much of what ensues is being captured on camera by Brian who is recording his workday for a personal video project. Thats where a lot of the shaky-cam comes in.In between were introduced to their personal lives. Mike has been married for a while to Gabby (Natalie Martinez) and their first child is on the way. Brian recently met Janet (Anna Kendrick from Up in the Air) and he thinks shes the one. Thats where the sweetness comes in.Ayer hints at some things that it would be intriguing to explore more such as the beefs between L.A.s black and Hispanic gangs as the territory of the latter envelops that of the former. In End of Watch both sides are pretty much reduced to being one-dimensional targets and victims as the focus is squarely on Brian and Mike. This isnt The Wire.But thanks to Gyllenhaals and Penas lived-in performances and Ayers ability to keep things moving as fast as a high-speed chase down I-405 there isnt much chance to linger over any cliches littering the streetscape like bullet casings.As the pair move toward their inevitable showdown theres actually a sense of foreboding and suspense.This is one traffic stop that turns out to be anything but routine.

By Peter Rainer Film critic September 21 2012 Save for later Saved Jake Gyllenhaal stars in End of Watch as a Los Angeles police officer. Scott Garfield/Open Road Films/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide The cop drama ""End of Watch"" is set in the mean streets of South Central Los Angeles and they have rarely looked meaner. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena play longtime LAPD partners whose roisterous friendship goes very deep. Both actors are marvelous - this may be the most nuanced and far-ranging performance Gyllenhaal has ever given - and writer-director David Ayer (who wrote ""Training Day"") is unapologetically frank about the dangers these men face.I wish that the Mexican drug cartel subplot was not so overwrought and Oliver Stone-ish and the decision to shoot much of the film ""Cops""-style is also problematic. (The whirlybird hand-held approach is no more ""realistic"" probably less so than using a tripod.) But the film puts you right inside an everyday inferno and to its credit doesnt turn down the heat.Grade B+ (Rated R for strong violence some disturbing images pervasive language including sexual references and some drug use.)

Comments click to enlarge End of Watch Recommended Video Watch on Amazon Watch on Netflix Rated R  109 minutes  2012 Im not sure who appointed David Ayer poet laureate for the LAPD but at least he takes the job seriously; along with the usual mean-streets bluster and brutality his cop-thriller screenplays (Training Day Dark Blue) conscientiously record the hardening effects of a thankless and frequently pointless job. This story of two patrolmen in South Central (Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena) turns on a first-person gimmick--as part of an amateur filmmaking project the characters wear micro-cameras on their shirts as they roll--and though Ayer directing his third feature drops the conceit whenever its inconvenient it enables him to fashion a consistently gripping tale without resorting to Hollywood plot mechanics. In fact theres very little plot here at all just an alternating current of patrol-car comedy and nightmarish emergency calls that require the heroes to plunge blindly into dangerous situations until they stumble onto one that offers no escape.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Sep. 20 2012 106PM EDT Last updated Thursday Sep. 20 2012 457PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by David Ayer Written by David Ayer Starring Jake Gyllenhaal Michael Pena Classification 18A Genre action Year 2012 Country USA Language English Early in his career David Ayer made his rep with Training Day. Now clearly hes made his peace with Hollywood. Ayer is back with the uniforms on the mean streets of South Central L.A. but his trademark grit and authenticity have been traded in for a far more palatable commodity in Tinseltown the appearance of grit and authenticity a patina that lends itself well to soft story arcs and tidy love interests and a melodramatic climax. So where once the police badges were tarnished now they glow like a saints halo. Yep what we have here is a panegyric to the boys in blue where squad-car buddies compete for their moral merit badges. Really this is an open and shut case of good cop/better cop. Screen grab from trailer for ""End of Watch"" Movies End of Watch official trailer But back to authenticitys appearance. Sporting a shaved head and a winning smile respectively Taylor and Zavala (Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena) share not only that squad car but also a penchant for mini-cameras worn on their vests. Seems Taylor is an aspiring filmmaker shooting a day-in-the-life video for classroom credit a happy coincidence that allows Ayer to go all YouTubey on us - you know lots of point-of-view shots and spinning angles and general graininess. More happily still the bad guys out there share an identical taste in cinematography; apparently when not busy packing heat or gang-banging or being crackheads they too are wannabe auteurs or so the direction would have us think. Anyway add up the visuals and eureka - faux grit.Real banter though. During the downtime behind the wheel buddy cops do love to chat and here Ayer hasnt lost his rough touch The dialogue is quick witty and entirely credible. So are the lead performances. Rambling on about their workplace worries and their domestic arrangements - shaved head has an exciting new girlfriend winning smile has a beloved wife - Gyllenhaal and Pena make for believable buds and give the picture its breezy pace. We definitely buy into the humanizing banter.Its the lionizing action thats no sale. Suspicions are raised early in a sequence where Zavala bad-mouthed by a gangsta sheds his gun-belt and challenges the dude to a fair fistfight. Which he inevitably wins. Which prompts the gangsta to give him props for being an honourable fellow. Sorry but Im calling b.s. on the authenticity scale (""Ya feel me?"").More troubling is the scripts penchant for overdemonizing the ghettos black residents. Now I wouldnt expect junkies to be model parents but to carve out some quiet time for a fix do they really duct-tape their babies mouths and lock the tykes in a closet? On the subject of imperilled infants dont forget the ones left behind in a burning building. Our heroes dont - they brave the flames to make the rescue then aw shucks deny their heroism. A stash of illicit firearms a garage-full of illegal immigrants and a nasty drug cartel later good cop and better cop are in deep do-do in a dark alley. Guns blaze blood is let yet rest assured that even in the cold aftermath as the credits roll their sacred bond is resurrected. Not to mention the banter.No doubt these twin saviours are a likeable tandem and they bear their cross lightly. Still End of Watch suffers from no end of sanctimony. Sainthood is all well and fine but it aint drama and on screen at least the question cries out Wheres a corrupt cop when you need him?

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT After a series of arrests two LAPD officers are marked for death by a drug cartel. BOTTOM LINE A rickety crime flick dressed in a trendy ""found footage"" style. Unconvincing despite a solid cast. CAST Jake Gyllenhaal Michael Pena Anna Kendrick LENGTH 149 The medium isnt much of a message in ""End of Watch"" a cop drama presented as ""found footage"" taken by people on both sides of the law. Its an attempt to update a creaky script in a trendy style and it might have worked if writer- director David Ayer had stayed true to his conceit. But by stationing cameras all over South Central Los Angeles for better angles on the action he keeps wrecking the sense of realism hes trying to build. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Comedy Central upset over use of fake Colbert? Our main window into the LAPD is Officer Brian Taylor a former Marine played by a sullen Jake Gyllenhaal; his partner Mike Zavala is the kind of noble minority that white cops have been paired with since ""Dirty Harry"" though Michael Pena (""World Trade Center"") gives him warmth if not depth. Taylor video-logs their patrols a hit parade of perp walloping drug confiscating and child rescuing. These guys are such crime-busting dynamos that they actually end up on a hit list. In an age of tiny lenses and cheap circuitry its almost believable that nearly every gangster drug dealer and assassin north of Juarez would carry a camera and press record while committing crimes. This at least explains why were privy to so many plot-driving conversations. But did someone walk into Jakes bedroom and film him getting hot and heavy with his new girl Janet (Anna Kendrick)? Who the heck found that footage? Ayer (""Street Kings"" ""Training Day"") piles up the bodies and pours on the blood but ""End of Watch"" comes closest to crackling when its characters are simply talking. Cody Horn and America Ferrera add a bit of grit as stonyhearted cops; Pena brings Gyllenhaal to life whenever theyre shooting the salty breeze in their cruiser. More of those moments and less wobbly camerawork would have been more convincing. 200 VideoJake Gyllenhaal on End of Watch PLOT After a series of arrests two LAPD officers are marked for death by a drug cartel.

Unlike recent Hollywood fare about Los Angeles police officers ""End of Watch"" portrays its subjects in a realistic light. Has any police department in the country been portrayed in a more consistently negative way than Hollywoods hometown cops the LAPD? Woody Harrelsons sociopathic officer in last years ""Rampart is just one of the recent countless examples. There was even a documentary that mocked the LAPDs motto ""To Serve and Protect because its long been in quotation marks on the side of patrol cars. That slogan is taken very seriously by the heroic -- if hardly straight-arrow -- heroes in ""End of Watch"" vividly written and directed by David Ayer who depicted the darker side of the LAPD in his script for ""Training Day. Brian (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike (Michael Pena) are a pair of street-smart hot shots longtime partners newly assigned to patrolling one of the scariest precincts of LAs South Central. Its a place where the most innocent-seeming call carries the possibility of sudden death -- as we see in the adrenaline-pumping high-speed chase that opens the film. Brian is taking a filmmaking class so he carries a camcorder everywhere and attaches micro-cameras to his and Mikes shirts -- much to the annoyance of fellow officers who remember the Rodney King case. Ayer employs the overused shaky-cam/found-footage format to breathe new life and vitality to the familiar buddy-cop genre -- think TVs ""Cops with a pair of very good actors behind the wheel. But cutting back and forth between that and more traditional camera work is distracting. A scene where Brian and Mike drag a kid out of a burning building -- rather than waiting for the fire department to show up -- is about as exciting and harrowing as anything Ive seen on a movie screen this year. The guys fearlessness earns the respect of even a jaded veteran (David Harbour) who resents their high spirits. But it also puts them in the cross hairs of a drug cartel that other LAPD colleagues have warned them not to mess with. This especially alarms Brians girlfriend (Anna Kendrick) and Mikes pregnant wife (Natalie Martinez) who never know whether their guys will survive their often brutally violent shifts. America Ferrara (""Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants) turns in an image-changing role as a tough lesbian officer who develops a grudging admiration for our heroes. ""End of Watch is not a perfect movie. It begins with a groan-worthy slogan (""Once upon a time in South Central . . ."") and its depiction of Hispanics -- including to some degree Mike -- tends toward stereotype at times. Gyllenhaal and Pena have great chemistry together though in their best performances to date. A memorable scene where the officers they play have to decide in a split second whether to kill a sadistic perp vividly puts you right into their very difficult jobs.

Starring Jake Gyllenhaal Michael Pena Anna Kendrick Natalie Martinez Frank Grillo America Ferrera David Harbour Shondrella Avery Cody Horn Director David Ayer Running time 149 Release Opened Sep 21 2012  Editorial Review A macho twist on buddy copsBy Michael OSullivanFriday September 21 2012There are no dirty cops in ""End of Watch"" another tense violent -- and surprisingly affecting -- police drama from ""Training Day"" writer David Ayer. Ayer who also directs has created a portrait of law enforcement under pressure that is as ennobling as it is gritty. Despite enduring a level of work stress well beyond what most of us deal with its heroes L.A.P.D. officers Brian Taylor and Mike Zavala (Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena respectively) arent alcoholic on the take or gratuitously violent. They arent exactly altar boys either. Occasionally Brian and Mike bend the rules. In one notable scene Mike removes his service weapon and dukes it out hand to hand with a belligerent citizen who has been baiting him (Everton Lawrence). That guy ends up having more respect for the police when he emerges from the fight. (It helps that Mike kicks the stuffing out of him. And that Mike doesnt press charges for assaulting an officer.) Such is the macho code of the street. Like ""Training Day"" ""End of Watch"" is a testosterone-fueled roller coaster ride where for the most part the only significant women are arm candy -- Anna Kendrick as Brians girlfriend and Natalie Martinez as Mikes wife. The rare female officers (America Ferrera and Cody Horn) almost behave like guys tossing off ""yo mamma"" insults and swaggering along with the boys. A welcome exception One of the main bad guys is actually a bad girl. Rapper Yahira ""Flakiss"" Garcia plays a scary gang-banger that Brian and Mike tangle with when in the course of their routine patrols they inadvertently find themselves interfering with the local operation of a ruthless Mexican drug cartel. As the film progresses toward its explosive conclusion the level of tension and violence -- both actual and potential -- becomes a bit hard to take. Every encounter is life or death with precious little downtime for Brian and Mike to simply eat doughnuts. Discoveries of mass graves duct-taped children and enslaved immigrants build toward a climax that opens -- opens -- with an officer who has been stabbed in the eye with a knife. Its powerful stuff but I almost felt like I needed an intermission. Thankfully Ayer allows Brian and Mike some time to simply talk. The exploration of their friendship which has been forged under the most difficult of circumstances is deep and ultimately convincing. ""End of Watch"" is a buddy-cop film with the emphasis on the ""buddy."" On the down side its also yet another movie utilizing the ""found footage"" gimmick thats all the current rage. Much of the film consists of shaky hand-held images purportedly shot by Brian for a filmmaking class hes taking. Even the villains are of the YouTube generation bringing a video camera along for a drive-by. Its an unnecessary distraction from the story which is a good one. Yes Ayer rubs our noses in some pretty grisly business but only in service of a larger point about the necessity and honor of law enforcement. ""I am the police"" Brian says in the films slightly pretentious voiceover narration ""and I make a difference."" Thats true but thats not Ayers only point. The best thing about ""End of Watch"" is not the action but the inaction. Contains often intense violence obscenity sexual dialogue and drug use.

"Movie review Good cops on mean streets in End of Watch - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowMovie review Good cops on mean streets in End of WatchDavid Ayers gritty humorous and moving film stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena as police officers on the beat in South-Central L.A.September 20 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Jake Gyllenhaal right and Michael Pena star as police offers in ""End... ( Scott Garfield / MCT )From the first tires-squealing sirens-blaring guns-blazing car chase to the last quiet conversation ""End of Watch"" is a visceral story of beat cops that is rare in its sensitivity rash in its violence and raw in its humor.For David Ayer who has long made the minefield of police work his metier this blood-drenched and unexpectedly moving film is his best cut yet on what life is like on that thin blue line. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael PeA+-a star as partners fighting crime on the streets of South-Central Los Angeles. Their beat is poverty riddled and gang infested. Drug running turf wars and lethal grudges that only end badly frame their days. Its all captured with a gritty hand-held intensity that keeps you on edge and unsettled waiting for the next shoe to drop.The story is in a way an ordinary one a regular cops who arent corrupt guys who chalk up any heroics to just doing their job. In a reflection of reality much of the film is spent with officers Brian Taylor (Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (PeA+-a) in their squad car. The age of cellphone videos has imprinted the films style. At times they feel barely an arms length away.No single bad guy emerges no one case has to be solved. Instead the films rhythm is set by the day-in and day-out routine of police work. Ayer has done a solid job of keeping Brian and Mike rocking between boredom and adrenaline-pumping action starting with Sarge (Frank Grillo) whose admonishments begin their shift to the streets where they never know what will happen and finally to the paperwork at end of watch. The crime is of the most depressing kind a crack mothers dead bodies drugs and even some human trafficking a the scenarios seemingly as random in their placement as the gruesome violence that colors them.The worst of the worst is a Latino gang with ties to Mexicos Sinaloa cartel that keeps surfacing. They are a scary crew with names like Big Evil (Maurice Compte) Wicked (Diamonique) La La (Yahira Garcia) and Demon (Richard Cabral) and a rage that is full-blown crazy. Garcia and Compte are standouts at channeling anger in stomach-churning ways.Back in the car the officers pass the time giving each other grief. A pattern soon emerges because Mike is running this road show razzing Brian about his new girlfriend Janet (Anna Kendrick) offering up very graphic relationship advice regaling him with stories of family life with Gabby (Natalie Martinez) who is pregnant with their first child. Kendrick and Martinez do their job to expose the softer side of their guys but they are really just a few threads woven into the fabric of the partners lives. There are other good turns around the edges especially America Ferrera toughening up for her by-the-book cop and David Harbour as bitter older officer Van Hauser who the guys relentlessly prank.But the only relationship that really matters is the one between Brian and Mike. There is a lot of love in that car and PeA+-a and Gyllenhaal make you feel it. The easy back and forth between them a topics ranging from raunchy nonsense to philosophical musings a have an organic feel that is hard to come by and usually worth the wait. These moments seeded through the film nearly always bring tension-releasing laughter which we need as much as they do.In Brian it feels as if Gyllenhaal has finally found his way back home after struggling through a series of roles that didnt quite fit in the years after his ""Brokeback Mountain"" breakout. Hes got a way of playing things so close to the vest that it requires a character with a rich interior life that he can expose in a look or a laugh. As good as Gyllenhaal is in this PeA+-a nearly steals the show. From the moment Mike Zavala steps into view he is an LAPD beat cop in every move he makes a whether duking it out with a drunk or dancing with his wife.Ayer has been best known until now for his searing script for 2001s ""Training Day"" also a story of cops in L.A. A proven writer his previous forays into directing a ""Harsh Times"" and ""Street Kings"" a have been less skilled their cop stories more of the same. ""End of Watch"" is different a distinctive and street worthy.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESCar-chase suspect tries to shake police at McDonalds...December 18 2013Movie review The RobberMay 6 2011MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowNot_live_webEntertainment_not_live_webCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-end-of-watch-20120921,0,104575.story",200,endofwatch13,endofwatch,latimes

Jake Gyllenhaal plays Officer Brian Taylor one of two key cops in ""End of Watch."" Photo Open Road Films End of Watch review tense eye catching 1 / 1 Back to Gallery End of Watch Drama. Starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena. Directed by David Ayer. R. 109 minutes.) From the perch of a police cruiser dashboard the camera captures the cops as they tear after the bad guys through the streets of Los Angeles - engines roaring tires screeching sharp turns taken at nutcase speed - in the breathless killer intro to the riveting ""End of Watch."" Eventually the bad guys tumble out of their shiny black car and start shooting at the cops behind the dash two young uniforms who shoot back hard. The criminals end up dead. The cops (Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena) return to the force a month later exonerated. That opener sets a few important things in motion. One is the pacing You will not be bored. Another is the dramatic tension it ratchets and rises and rolls. But the chief moving objects are the cameras whether mounted on the dash pinned to a chest pocket or carried around by Officer Brian Taylor (Gyllenhaal). The shaky-cam footage documents his life on the force with his partner Mike Zavala (Pena) as the two of them patrol the hood with good intentions and a startling courage that jostles close to recklessness. A lot of this is rough on the eyeballs; and when Mexican gangsters get involved it only gets rougher. Yet the movie balances the messier work of an L.A. cop thriller - shootouts rescues missing kids gruesome discoveries in cramped and rotting backrooms - with a loose joshing character development that enriches all that wobbly-cam. The best scenes are filmed inside the cruiser dashboard shots that face inward instead of out catching Gyllenhaal and Pena in moments so playful and true they make all other buddy cops look bogus by comparison. ""End of Watch"" was written and directed by David Ayer whose body of work is heavy on gangsters lowlifes and the gray zone between those who enforce the law and those who break it. His most recent film ""Street Kings"" implied top-down all-out multi-tentacled corruption throughout the entire LAPD. That movie was not the apex of realism nor did it aim to be. This one tries. As a filmmaking gimmick the found-footage conceit is almost played out - and ""End of Watch"" doesnt even exploit it consistently mixing up the guerrilla-video shots with occasional soaring or other illogical POVs. But at least its used to deepen its main characters and give them room to breathe; at least it lends the film a lively intimacy that in its best moments makes us feel like were crammed inside the cop car with them.

They fall into an almost paint-by-numbers genre that at best feels comfortably familiar and at worst tired and stale. End of Watch ( out of four; rating R; opens today nationwide) transcends those limitations.With its gritty unnerving style and darkly funny banter its an action thriller that has more in common with Training Day -- also written by writer/director David Ayer -- than with Lethal Weapon.It works mostly because of the chemistry between leads Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena who come off as likable and convincing as beat partners assigned to the meanest streets in South Central Los Angeles an LAPD division affectionately dubbed ""shootin Newton.""Theres a winning camaraderie between officers Brian Taylor (Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Pena). Neither is on the take nor two days from retirement. Theyre not dancing the good cop/bad cop shuffle. They good-naturedly trade ethnic barbs and dont shy away from vulgarity but theyre essentially a pair of decent guys with a thrill-seeking bent doing their best to protect and serve.The story does tread some familiar ground. Taylor and Zavala endure attacks from nasty tattooed gangbangers -- though villainous women play a bigger part than in past cop movies -- and they get shooed off crime scenes by federal law enforcers. At times the narrative threatens to become a sociology lesson. Where African-American gangs once controlled the neighborhood the current toughs in charge are Latinos with ties to Mexican drug cartels now the long-distance ruling elite. But immigration and shifting demographics are a reality and an integral part of this gritty story. Equally key is the easy way that men and women of various ethnicities casually match wits and brawn.The shaky camera work -- often a gimmicky stylistic option -- is an effective choice here both as a story element and a technique. Taylor documents their daily experiences as part of a documentary for a class so the off-kilter footage makes sense in this context and the films title might be ironic since so many of the players including the gang members seem to be documenting and re-watching their antics. The jittery cinematography potently draws viewers in for pulse-racing chase scenes and edgy stand-offs with nefarious locals.Responding to a routine call the pair stumbles on a secret that unwittingly makes them targets for a Mexican drug lord. While this may not sound like radically new territory the fast-paced approach is unnerving particularly as it exposes the full magnitude of the operation these ordinary cops are up against.The joking banter between Zavala and Taylor works better than more serious dialogue. Taylor confused by what he encounters utters two words with a sense of awe but no real context -- ""human trafficking"" -- as if that explains everything. It doesnt. But the raw grittiness of the story keeps the viewer in a state of satisfying suspense.Pena so good in films including Crash Babel and World Trade Center shines with charisma. Its a pleasure to see him go head-to-head with Gyllenhaal who gives his best performance since Brokeback Mountain. Their characters are fleshed out with moments of rage terror humor and introspection -- all in a days work for these men in uniform.The ensemble cast effectively rounds out the drama especially the deft performances of Frank Grillo as the pairs sergeant and David Harbour and America Ferrera as fellow officers. Anna Kendrick and Natalie Martinez are engaging as Taylor and Zavalas wives respectively.Unlike many action thrillers where the viewer is fairly certain that no real harm can come to the protagonists such is never the case here. In this gritty ride-along we sense that anything can happen which adds to the propulsive momentum of a riveting story. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

More about End of Watch >> His territory is narrow but he owns it cops in Los Angeles. And in End of Watch with Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena as officers on patrol in one of the nastier quadrants of South Central L.A. Ayer delivers a film of extraordinary fire power literally (AK-47s Glocks Smith amp; Wessons) and figuratively. Deploying all manner of cameras - microcams that hook on shirt pockets dashboarded-mounted cams cellphone cams webcams surveillance cams HD camcorders - Ayer follows officers Brian Taylor (Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Pena) as they investigate domestic disturbances respond to complaints of raucous late-night parties make traffic stops and rescue babies from burning houses. All in a days work - work that they love - until they pull over a pickup truck discover a cache of guns and bags of cash and then make an even more momentous find at a house in the barrio. ""You just tugged on the tail of a snake"" a federal agent warns Taylor the G-men in bullet-proof jackets swooping down on the two LAPD uniforms. ""Its going to turn around and bite you back."" Visceral and violent but anchored in the humanity of its two leads End of Watch feels more real than reality TV (which isnt saying that much I guess) but boasts the pulse-pounding thrills of slicker Hollywood cop pics too. The auto-documentation gimmick comes by way of Gyllenhaals character - Taylor is in grad school taking a course in moviemaking and so he has decided to record his experiences as a beat cop poking his camera around the precinct locker room letting it run during roll call taking it onto the street. His superiors dont like the idea and hes leaving himself open for all sorts of litigation but he does it anyway. Taylor is like that - cocky. He and Zavala are best friends and as they cruise around stopping in corner bodegas making vehicle checks they talk about their hopes their plans their dreams. Zavala is married to his highschool sweetheart (Natalie Martinez) and shes about to have a baby. Taylor is tired of the rituals and rigors of dating and is looking for a serious relationship - and thinks he has found one in a girl he first meets at a Starbucks Janet (Anna Kendrick). Things are looking good for Taylor and Zavala their bond is strong they have each others back - and then a Southland street gang tied in with a Mexican drug cartel gets its marching orders. End of Watch has its flaws. The ""hoodrats and homies"" with names like La La Demon and Big Evil can come off as cartoonish and the raw honesty of the film is compromised by the knee-jerk mechanisms of if not a happy ending a happier ending than the terrifying climactic shootout dictates. But End of Watch is powerful and Gyllenhaal and Pena who trained for months for their roles display the moves and mentality of dedicated police officers. Its not a pretty job.

Hes made four cops-n-cartels dramas since his Oscar-winning Training Day a decade ago; the latest End of Watch easily qualifies as the most resonant. It begins with a tire-squealing pedal-to-the-metal chase through South Central L.A. shot through the windshield of a police cruiser manned by officers Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Pena). Because Taylors taking a film class in his time off they travel with one extra piece of equipment in their patrol car a camcorder -- useful when the chase ends in a shootout but still much to the annoyance of his superiors. Still if these cine-savvy partners dont exactly go by the book theyre good guys -- good cops dealing daily with all kinds of horrors from missing kids to human trafficking and somehow staying unwarped professional and decent. This should not be a remarkable story but in Hollywood where cops are mostly considered interesting only when they go rogue it kind of is. Yes these guys are cocky and pumped up those badges on their chests a power trip as they strut into gang territory with guns drawn. But the badges are also a responsibility they take seriously. Taylor and Zavala are ""street"" in the words of one of the gang-bangers they deal with meaning worthy of trust. Their street cred is sufficient enough that theyre even given a heads-up from a guy theyve previously arrested when they cross a drug cartel thats moving into the area. Not that they listen of course which ratchets up the stakes in a tale thats already drum-tight with tension. Ayer who wrote and directed is hardly breaking new ground here; the elements he employs are time-honored from the Cops-style minicam footage that lets the audience ride shotgun to the shootouts pumped up by Red Bull and coffee. Even the buddy banter that tells you these guys would lay down their lives for each other sounds familiar. But Ayer and his cast are serving all of it up not just with the urgency the director is so good at but with an emotional undercurrent that makes it feel remarkably authentic. End of Watch is one thriller where the adrenaline rush considerable as it is is almost always put in the service of character. Happily the character on display turns out to be considerable too.

Scott Garfield/Open Road Films hide caption toggle caption Scott Garfield/Open Road Films End of Watch Director David Ayer Genre Action Running Time 109 minutes Rated R for strong violence some disturbing images pervasive language including sexual references and some drug use With Jake Gyllenhaal Michael Pena America Ferrera Anna Kendrick Watch Clips Look At Me Look At Me Credit Open Road Films Quinceanera Quinceanera Credit Open Road Films A Pattern A Pattern Credit Open Road Films Cop dramas may be a dime a dozen but David Ayers End of Watch is one of a kind The picture is by turns clever compelling and unconscionable so artful in its artifice that sometimes it almost fools you into believing that its reality. Thats the point This story of two young Los Angeles police officers who run afoul of a Mexican drug cartel is told through faux found footage shot by the cops themselves as they patrol one of the roughest parts of the city. We see these guys played by Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena horsing around in the patrol car one minute and busting down doors the next. Some of the horrors they encounter -- two young children locked in a closet and bound with duct tape a crackheads babysitting technique -- are so unsettling these young cops can barely fathom them. Unfortunately for them and for us things get worse and the scale of horror and violence escalates. Meanwhile Gyllenhaal and Pena experience and yak about so many of lifes pleasures and annoyances Pena speaks glowingly of married life and looks forward to the birth of his first child. (His wife is played in a small but lively turn by Natalie Martinez.) Gyllenhaal thinks hes finally met the girl of his dreams - shes played by Anna Kendrick -- and in between cracking occasional benign off-color jokes earnestly asks his partner for advice. These are the finest scenes in the movie places where the actors get to build their characters layer by layer. Gyllenhaal with his shaven head and enormous inquisitive eyes looks both haunted and full of life like a Max Beckmann charcoal drawing. Pena has the face of a Renaissance cherub if such adorable creatures roamed the Earth wearing navy blue uniforms and carrying guns. The connection between their characters feels palpable and true. Its the gimmickry of the technique that gets in the way particularly as the challenges the two cops face get uglier and deadlier. Writer-director Ayer is best known as the writer of Training Day; hes also directed two features the 2008 Street Kings (with Keanu Reeves and Forest Whitaker) and the 2005 Harsh Times (with Christian Bale). The found-footage technique gives everything a you-are-there immediacy that sometimes stretches the bounds of whats honorable for a filmmaker to show At times Ayer rubs our noses almost literally in the devastating horribleness of it all. Theres nothing wrong with that exactly unless a filmmaker is using it for shock value. And sometimes End of Watch purports to be giving us realism when its really trading in sensationalism. The more the camera shakes the more were supposed to buy the illusion that were really out there with these guys patrolling the streets and risking our lives. The technique is seductive a scarily effective approximation of living someones reality for a few hours. Whats more the pictures big tragedy is played for the ultimate in pathos and its effective as heck. But it also leaves you with the feeling that maybe youve been had -- that the risks these characters have taken moviefied versions of the kinds of risks real-life cops have to face every day have simply been put forth in the service of entertainment. The jittery camera moves and awkward angles make it all seem so real; the novelty of it is energizing if you can bring yourself to forget that its also something of a betrayal.

""End of Watch"" the electrical pulse-pounding new action drama from cop-obsessed writer and director David Ayer will no doubt be presented in certain quarters as pro-LAPD propaganda - or if you prefer this phrasing as a paean to heroism and patriotism in the face of lawlessness and disorder. Im not much interested in those interpretations which try to boil down this mythic thrilling and brilliantly made motion picture to a political point system. Its at least the best cop movie since James Grays ""We Own the Night"" and very likely since Antoine Fuquas memorable ""Training Day"" (which not coincidentally was written by Ayer).Im not claiming that political and social questions are irrelevant when it comes to a movie set inside Americas most notorious big-city police department. They cant be. But those things are not the purview of Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Pena) the knights in blue whose odyssey into deepening violent nightmare forms the narrative of ""End of Watch."" Ayer tips his hand on this about as much as he could in an opening monologue delivered by Gyllenhaal on top of a hair-raising chase scene viewed from the surveillance cam of Taylor and Zavalas black-and-white. ""I am the police and I will arrest you"" Taylor intones. He is an inexorable force he goes on whose task is to enforce laws he did not make and may not agree with using whatever degree of force is necessary and with zero regard for the reasons - good or bad understandable or not - why someone may have violated them.A muscular charmer with a shaved head faint intellectual pretensions and a reputation as a ladykiller Taylor also knows when hes out of his depth. ""Look Im just a ghetto street cop"" he tells a mysterious federal agent carrying an assault rifle at one point. This is just after Taylor and Zavala have blundered into an East L.A. house and busted an ultra-sinister Sinaloa cartel hitman who is babysitting a cage full of filthy and dehydrated illegal immigrants. What the federale tells them not in so many words is that they were screwed before and theyre double-screwed now and that some of the scariest criminals in the world want to kill them. Being ghetto street cops Taylor and Zavala pretty much shrug this off Scary people want to kill us every day dude.One way of explaining the social context of ""End of Watch"" is to say that its a war movie in all but name and as in say ""Full Metal Jacket"" or ""The Hurt Locker"" the question of whether the war is worth waging in the first place hovers over the whole enterprise but is never directly asked let alone answered. If Ayer relies a little too much on the 21st-century premise that everyone in ""End of Watch"" is shooting their own videos - Taylor inside the police cruiser the posse of heavily armed Latino gangbangers in their stolen minivan the participants at a backyard African-American barbecue as it gets shot up - theres no disputing the formal ingenuity of this movie or its breakneck forward momentum. (The cinematography is by Roman Vasyanov who shot the delightful Russian musical ""Hipsters."") Beneath their studied casualness macho bluster and chops-busting repartee Taylor and Zavala are conscious of the mounting and imminent menace in every moment. While Zavala exchanges chitchat out the car window with a guy on the street only we can see that he has his sidearm drawn and pressed against the door just below the other guys line of sight. You Might Also Like Gyllenhaal has already shown tremendous range as an adult actor way beyond what could have been predicted from his ""Donnie Darko"" youth. While I think he was terrific for example as the feckless male lead in the underperforming rom-com ""Love and Other Drugs"" his performance here as Taylor might be his best since ""Brokeback Mountain"" and pushes into a new direction. Taylor is a practical joker and a bit of a cowboy whose Achilles heel as a cop is his headstrong ambitious nature - exactly what makes him so appealing. He has wonderful chemistry with Pena who has spent his whole career (or so it seems) playing upright Latino cops but never one as complicated and well-developed as Zavala. His self-assigned role is to be the more level-headed of the duo the straight man who feeds Taylor his gag lines the married man who has to convince his wayward bro that his latest girlfriend Janet (Anna Kendrick) is the for-sure must-marry real deal and not just another you-know-what.And yes marvelous to tell this is not a movie about crooked or dirty cops. We in fact dont meet any of those not even Taylor and Zavalas embittered and misanthropic nemesis Van Hauser (David Harbour) whose LAPD career is about to end in especially ghoulish fashion. As for our two heroes they frequently engage in homophobic and/or homoerotic banter and childish pranks and occasionally fudge the boundaries of by-the-books police procedure. But we never see them take a bribe or shoot an unarmed civilian or harass somebody just for being black or brown. (This is East L.A. where that describes roughly 100 percent of the population.) Theyre trying to do the job theyve been assigned to do as best they can and as in those war movies I mentioned above that task is slowly sucking them down into hell. I think understanding the mythic or even poetic character of ""End of Watch"" as it goes beyond gritty and realistic violence into a zone where Hieronymus Bosch collides with Dante is crucial to getting a handle for example on Ayers stereotypical depiction of the Latino gangsters who are stalking Taylor and Zavala. It isnt that having a Mexican-American hero whos bereft of prison tattoos and weird facial hair inoculates him against charges of racism. Its more that the posse of hoods - including imaginatively a couple of super-hard-ass lesbian gunslingers - whove taken on the Sinaloa cartels contract on Taylor and Zavala are meant to be demonic rather than human.At the end of every quest in literary history the heroes are subjected to a final test to prove their courage their morality and their loyalty and so it is on the hallucinatory climax of ""End of Watch"" when our blue-clad warriors are lured into a catastrophic ambush. We may well wonder what the point was as the gunsmoke fades from a back alley where poorly disciplined hotheads in blue shirts and bulletproof vests represent the last fading vestige of the social contract. If David Ayer knows he isnt telling. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Lionsgate By Joe Morgenstern Sept. 20 2012 501 p.m. ET ""Dredd 3D"" is the iPhone of recent action thrillers. The movie doesnt do apps or for that matter drop calls but this particularly violent thriller is distinguished by elegant design. Whats familiar about the film is the grunge concatenation of firepower body count and gross-out abuse of all-too-tender flesh. Whats exceptional is the orchestration of color form light and dark (lots of dark) 3-D technology and digital effects into a look that amounts to a vision. The director was Pete Travis working from a shrewd terse screenplay by Alex Garland; the production designer was Mark Digby and the cinematographer was Anthony Dod Mantle. (The latter two collaborated similarly on ""Slumdog Millionaire."") The opening shot is a variation on the theme of ""WALLE""--a slow flyby over a vast garbage dump of a megalopolis in a blighted future except that this sprawl Mega City One is fully inhabited. The city is a battleground between free-range criminals and so-called Judges the Robocop-ish descendants of Rambo who function as judges juries and executioners not to mention noisemakers what with their flatulent motorcycles and end-of-days weaponry. Chief among them is yes you guessed it Judge Dredd who was played by a glum Sylvester Stallone in the fairly dreadful 1995 film ""Judge Dredd"" and who is played this time around by Karl Urban. Played is a big word for what the helmeted actor is able to do with his husky voice slyly laconic dialogue and the visible parts of his face i.e. his scowl and stubble. Dredds partner an anxious rookie named Cassandra doesnt wear a helmet since it would scramble her psychic powers so she is played visibly as well as audibly by Olivia Thirlby who succeeds in investing an action figure with affecting fear impressive courage and a commitment to justice that serves as Cassandras compass. The story has been assembled from repurposed genre elements a vertical ghetto 200 stories high controlled by a scar-faced prostitute turned drug lord--or drug lady--named Ma-Ma; shes played to a lurid fare-thee-well by Lena Headey. And Ma-Mas product comes out of a shop that looks a lot like an industrial-scale meth lab. But its the nature of the drug that dictates much of the productions visual distinction. The compound in question Slo-Mo makes its addicts feel as if time is passing at 1% of its normal speed. The effects of Slo-Mo are visualized by super-slo-mo cinematography in sequences of dreamy sumptuousness iridescent soap bubbles afloat over Ma-Mas bathtub (and thanks to the 3-D over the first few rows of theater seats); bodies falling ever so slo-moly onto public spaces; one body drifting down an elevator shaft in the company of glass shards that flutter and swirl like clouds of what used to be called in a more innocent time Disney Dust. Occasionally ""Dredd 3D"" bogs down in passages that arent supposed to be slow; the movie will almost stop every now and then to admire its own physical beauty. And theres no way of elevating those exploding heads and sliced-off limbs into dramatic art. All the same the juxtaposition of brutality and improbable chivalry in a dystopia built on the foundations of ""Blade Runner"" ""Brazil"" and even ""Naked City"" is a vision thats hard to dismiss. Watch a clip from the documentary ""How to Survive a Plague"" the story of two coalitions ACT UP and TAG (Treatment Action Group) whose activism turned AIDS from a death sentence into a manageable condition. (Video Sundance Selects) How to Survive a Plague If you watched ""How to Survive a Plague"" with the sound turned off you would readily see it as a history of the struggle to make a city and then a nation aware of AIDS that disease of fearful virulence for which there was no treatment when it first emerged in this country in the early 1980s. The archival footage most of it shot by the participants tells the tale vividly demonstrations in New York confrontations in Washington acts of civil disobedience street theater performed by activists determined to accelerate the laggardly pace of research by the government and the pharmaceutical industry. Thats a stirring tale but an incomplete one. Turn up the sound tune in to the passionate voices in David Frances brilliant documentary and you learn how some members of the activist group Act Up--members who in many cases were HIV positive--became instrumental in developing and testing the protease inhibitors that have finally proved equal to the plague. They did so out of desperation of course feeling themselves doomed to the fate that was decimating the gay community. Whats so remarkable about their decadeslong campaign though is how desperation led to inspiration--to the inspired notion that they as nonscientists could still take their fate in their own hands. By applying sufficient logic and mastering sufficient science--by wielding brain power as well as street power as one man puts it--they were able to join forces with Big Pharma FDA officials and National Institutes of Health doctors not only in focusing on promising drugs but in designing drug trials that were both responsible and expeditious. Susan Ellenberg a former chief biostatistician at the NIHs division of AIDS recalls being excited and impressed by Act Ups strategy. ""They were not against drug trials"" she tells Mr. Frances camera. ""They wanted to get the right answers but they wanted humane trials."" A similar tribute comes from Dr. Anthony Fauci then as now the NIHs director of AIDS research ""They elevated themselves with their self-education."" And one of the leaders of Act Ups campaign Peter Staley closes the film with a stirring postscript ""The way we did it the way we took care of ourselves and each other...is just mind-boggling. Just incredible."" Its an upbeat ending subject to a stark reservation. Millions of people around the world are still dying of AIDS every year an end-title card notes because they cant afford the drugs that could keep them alive. Watch a clip from the film ""End of Watch."" Two young officers (Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena) are marked for death after confiscating a small cache of money and firearms from the members of a notorious cartel during a routine traffic stop. End of Watch David Ayers ""End of Watch"" derives huge energy most of it false from Roman Vasyanovs cinematography as well as from genuinely impressive performances by Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena. Its not too much to say that like ""Dredd 3D"" this pounding saga of street-cop partners in Los Angeles is often about cinematography since everyone is either shooting video--Mr. Gyllenhaals Officer Brian Taylor is a would-be filmmaker--or being shot (by dashboard cameras hidden cameras and surveillance cameras) not to mention being shot at by a bloodthirsty succession of really really bad guys and girls who are involved with the closest thing to al Qaeda that the movies can come up with on domestic soil the Sinaloa cartel. Shallow down inside ""End of Watch"" is a music-video Frappuccino of quick cuts sparkling banter serial crises grisly violence and tongue-jerk profanity. (The fg quotient is astronomical. So is the producer quotient; 16 of them listed in the credits.) But the film is exciting in its manipulative way and exhausting and occasionally relieved by the humanity of Brians love for Janet a bright lively woman played by the always appealing Anna Kendrick. Whats more its a great recruiting tool for the LAPD. Unencumbered by nuance these cops are as pure as they are brave. Watch a clip from the film ""Trouble with the Curve."" An ailing baseball scout (Clint Eastwood) takes his daughter (Amy Adams) along for one last recruiting trip. Also starring John Goodman Justin Timberlake and Robert Patrick. (Video Warner Bros.) ENLARGE Clint Eastwood and Justin Timberlake in Trouble With the Curve. Warner Bros. Pictures Trouble With the Curve This antediluvian baseball drama stars Clint Eastwood as a washed-up scout Gus and Amy Adams as Mickey the daughter who reluctantly teams up with him. The director was Robert Lorenz who has worked with Mr. Eastwood since the mid-1990s as a producer an assistant director or both. Its his debut feature and bush league almost all the way a lifeless rendering of an amateurish script (by Randy Brown) that covers some of the same ground as ""Moneyball""--old-fashioned intuition versus newfangled number-crunching--but covers it from some time warp where audiences still enjoy declamatory acting mawkish sentiments and wheezy editing. The movies most glaring problem is Mr. Eastwoods decision to play not very well pretty much the same character he portrayed most recently in ""Gran Torino""--an old geezer who has an enlarged prostate macular degeneration and a misanthropic demeanor thats supposed to be lovable except that it isnt; Gus is mostly a tiresome grump. Ms. Adams does her endearing best to lighten things up. Along with Mickeys touching efforts at reconciliation with her father she has some enjoyable encounters with Justin Timberlakes Johnny a charming ex-pitcher whos trying to reinvent himself as a play-by-play announcer. ""Trouble With the Curve"" finally finds its zone when Gus and Mickey find the young baseball prodigy theyve been looking for. That doesnt happen until the narratives last inning though too late to save the movie. Id call it ""Neanderthalball."" ENLARGE DVD Focus Zabriskie Point (1970) The Italian filmmaker Michelangelo Antonioni used slow-motion cinematography as it had never been used before to evoke a vision of America and its consumer goods blowing up in a spectacular apocalypse. At this late date thats the only reason to watch the film an ignominious lapse by a cinema master that deplores all things American except for our nations supposedly innocent youth. (The fatuous iconography came out of the 1960s reinforced by European condescension.) The young hero Mark (Mark Frechette) and young heroine Daria (Daria Halprin) meet in Death Valley where the heat is searing and the dialogue is dead. Milk (2008) Gus Van Sants film with Sean Penn as Harvey Milk opens on the gay activist and San Francisco supervisor dictating into a tape recorder. The year is 1978 and the words are taken from a tape full of foreboding that Milk dictated shortly before he and the citys mayor George Moscone were shot to death by a former supervisor Dan White. Mr. Penn won an Oscar for his performance; so did Dustin Lance Black for his screenplay. Milks life had previously been celebrated in Rob Epsteins 1984 documentary ""The Times of Harvey Milk"" which won the Oscar it deserved. The Good Girl (2002) Jake Gyllenhaal is an amorous adolescent who calls himself Holden--he thinks hes an embodiment of J.D. Salingers literary hero--in this singularly interesting and often misunderstood film that Miguel Arteta directed from an original script by Mike White. The misunderstanding centers on Jennifer Aniston as Justine an unhappy wife whos disconnected from her feelings and from the consequences of her behavior. Detractors have called her performance dull. Ive called it impeccable and austere. The fine cast includes Mr. White John C. Reilly Tim Blake Nelson and Zooey Deschanel.

"End of Watch is hard to watch - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate At times End of Watch is hard to watch Share Tweet Share Tweet By Wesley Morris Globe Staff | 09.20.12 | 423 PM Related Link Find showtimes and theaters In ""End of Watch"" Jake Gyllenhaal plays a cocky prankster LA cop who takes a camera to work for reasons that amount to nothing dramatically. One of the Chicano thugs on his beat also has a camera. Their hand-held footage is thrown into a blender with the rest of what the director of photography Roman Vasyanov shot and pureed for 109 minutes. The camera is just everywhere from the point of view of everything. When I left the movie the other night people complained of seasickness. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The camerawork does afford an opportunity to hear a macho gangsta say ""Get that outta my face."" But even then the movie cant convince you that a car full of gangstas on their way to a drive-by has room in the car for a videographer. But thats where we are with ""End of Watch"" a thriller that saves all its suspense for the final 20 or so minutes which the movies marketing has distilled into a trailer about two cops -- Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena -- who look scared that theyve stumbled into trouble. Its a different better movie than that. Some people will come looking for shoot-outs and craziness -- and theyre here. But writer and director David Ayer has written whats basically a buddy comedy/cop drama. Officers Brian Taylor (Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Pena) sit in pre-shift briefs they stage pranks they mouth off to anybody. Mike enters a thugs house and challenges him to fight. The months of heroic deeds (the drug busts the child rescues) and good luck (not dying) culminates in a professional worst-case scenario. Ayer specializes in LAPD potboilers. Hes best known as the writer of ""Training Day"" (thats in the marketing too). Like that movie the other thrillers hes directed -- ""Harsh Times"" and ""Street Kings"" -- present psychopathology as side effect of police work. I dont buy any of them -- theyre ridiculously overblown (""Street Kings"" entertainingly so) yet underwritten. Ayer isnt making social or political points not interesting or fresh ones anyway. Hes making movies. ""End of Watch"" is the first of them to settle into what feels like the true rhythms of police work -- the doldrums the driving the struggles to stay awake the smack talk. (This time its the criminals who are nuts.) Mainly though its the bond between Taylor and Zavala thats the heart of the movie. They mock each others cultures. (This is the rare movie happy to treat whiteness as a race.) They talk about their romantic relationships. Taylor has just started dating someone (Anna Kendrick) and Zavalas been married to the same exuberant woman (Natalie Martinez) his entire adult life. There are 6 million cop shows on television right now. On none of them have I heard two men speak to each other with as much natural affinity as these two. This is the sort of cop movie that works the way romantic dramas do. You have to believe the two stars love each other deeply enough for the finale to affect you. Gyllenhaal and Pena are two good actors that the movies are still unsure how to use. Gyllenhaal was headed for some kind of major pop but his talent is not a movie stars. Hes an intense and studious actor of small quiet gestures. Hes not an action figure. After ""The Prince of Persia"" I hope he understands that. I think Pena can do everything -- and pretty much has every limited thing the movies will allow a young Latin actor to do of course. Hes one of those wonderful actors like Kimberly Elise and Thandie Newton whose talent hasnt yet found the role that empties the slot machine. For hours I could watch him and Gyllenhaal drive around and mix it up with the rest of the cast which includes America Ferrera Cody Horn Frank Grillo and David Harbor. Ayer seems to know how lucky he is to have them. I just wish he had found a style that really let us appreciate their deceptive ease with his material. But the movie is often a mess of bad camerawork and insecure editing. It settles down eventually but Ayers never justifies their use. He may have wanted to create an air of disorientation. Maybe he wanted to save money. He succeeded only in making his movie look cheap. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Artificial slope to open at Buck Hill this fall next Movies 170535686 End of Watch Good cops bad town REVIEW As partners in the LAPD Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena try to keep it real in a turbulent violent city. By Colin Covert Star Tribune September 21 2012 -- 828am Handout Open Road Films Jake Gyllenhaal (right) and Michael Pena in ""End of Watch."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""End of Watch"" is 10 cups of coffee in cinema form a visceral punch not for the faint of heart. Writer/director David Ayer (who scripted ""Training Day"") brings a rough aggressive energy to the picture staying within the broad outlines of the buddy-cop formula but investing the characters with no-bull authenticity. Jake Gyllenhaal plays good-natured LAPD officer Brian Taylor whose ever-present video camera sets up the premise that were viewing a found-footage film. In the locker room he drags his half-dressed squad-car partner Mike Zavala (Michael Pena) into the frame and the way Mike elbows his way back out again sets the tone for the pairs trash-mouthed macho bickering. Theyre a good-cop/good-cop team trolling the hot hard streets of South Central. The film has an appealing way of undercutting police thriller cliches. Mike would usually be a supporting player with Brian taking the lead. In this film the Mexican-American isnt the sidekick. Hes savvier married with a kid on the way underlining his status as a mature figure with moral responsibilities of his own. Neither guy is the others comic relief. Theyre both cut-ups when the mood is light and heart-attack serious otherwise. Both of them are good at their work. Both feel a tension between their home life and job. Anna Kendrick plays Brians supportive but concerned girlfriend Natalie Martinez is Mikes feisty pregnant wife and the domestic details ring true. The actors are in top form. Pena merges seamlessly into his tough soulful funny role. Gyllenhaal still movie-star handsome even with a shaved head looks less like hes playing a cop and more like he might be one. When the action shifts into overdrive as a Mexican cartel targets the partners were deeply invested making the vivid violence more than empty thrills. While Roman Vasyanovs turbulent cinematography often captures vantage points no carry-along camera could record the virtuoso handheld chase scenes shootings and car wrecks are electric with urgency. The films look is a sordid naturalism rendered with a directness rarely encountered. When the partners plunge into a burning building to rescue two abandoned babies or their police cruiser slams into the tail of a getaway van the danger is immediate and compulsively watchable. END OF WATCH  1/2 OUT OF FOUR STARS RATING R FOR STRONG VIOLENCE SOME DISTURBING IMAGES PERVASIVE LANGUAGE INCLUDING SEXUAL REFERENCES AND SOME DRUG USE. Ferociously gritty and unsentimentally tough the movie is a running battle between the idealism of its urban peacekeepers and fatalism about the ability of a small blue militia to pacify war-zone Los Angeles. The actors outstanding work in spasms of ferocity and moments of gentleness makes ""End of Watch"" a victory of craft over cliches.

Writer-director David Ayer who did the acclaimed script for Training Day grew up in South Central. And hes a stickler for detail. End of Watch has the feel of an uncensored reality show as Officer Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Officer Zavala (Michael Pena) work the Newton neighborhood for the LAPD. We see the action through the lenses of hand-held HD cameras operated by police gang members and assorted surveillance devices. With a camera mounted on his chest Gyllenhaal shot much of the film himself since his character is working on a documentarylike film project. Ayer keeps things unnervingly in your face. Its a dizzying sensation which drives some audiences nuts. If that sounds like you end this watch fast. More News Peter Travers 2012 Fall Movie Preview All Stories >> The plot smacks of day-old TV cop show. Taylor and Zavala are caught between battling drug cartels that make them targets when they seize drug money from a local gang. But Ayer raises the bar with a script that bristles with life. Unlike Denzel Washingtons dirty cop in Training Day Taylor and Zavala hold their moral balance. Zavala the family man is excited when Taylor thinks of settling down with the right girl (a scrappy Anna Kendrick). Dont panic. Action is the key here. Gyllenhaal and Pena spent five months doing ride-alongs to cement their bond with gritty authenticity. You hear that a lot from actors. This time it works. Gyllenhaal beefy and bald for the role invests Taylor with a core of intelligence as imposing as his brawn. And Pena is just the guy youd want watching your back. The pact these guys make in case one of them is paralyzed smacks of tear-jerking but these actors are too good to wallow in it. End of Watch gives you the savage whoosh of being on a job that can get you killed. Sins of cop cliches can be forgiven when a movie pays honest tribute to police on the line.

"Review of End of Watch - gritty film about LAPD Honeycutts HollywoodMovie reviews straight from the screening roomComedy Drama Action Indies Foreign Animation Docs Romance Sci-fi You are here Home / Drama / End of WatchEnd of Watch September 19 2012 By Kirk Honeycutt TweetIf I were a cynic I would say David Ayers ""End of Watch"" is a movie-length testimonial for the LAPD. But instead I left my cynicism in the Newton Station locker room and went on patrol with officers Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Zavala (Michael Pena). Im glad I did. The movie puts you into a black-and-white so you feel the tension and adrenaline rush as these cops patrol one of the worst districts in South Central L.A. Its every cop movie youve ever seen but from a fresh angle You go into each situation without a clue about its outcome. The closest dramatic work I can think of is Joseph Wambaughs first novel ""The New Centurions."" It too was virtually plotless and episodic in its depiction of the daily jobs of its police protagonists working in minority communities. (In a huge change though for the LAPD then and now in this film one of the cops is a Latino barking commands in Spanish and savvy to the gang-banger sub-culture.) As with Wambaugh then a cop trying his hand at portraying fellow officers in fiction ""End of Watch"" ignores the presence of bad cops or brutal ones. And unlike ""The New Centurions"" Ayer doesnt portray the alcoholism and divorce rates that take its toll on men and women in blue. The aim here is a gritty realistic portrait of daily patrols where danger is ever present as is black humor and the I-got-your-back brotherhood. Ayer has paid the kind of dues that gives him license to create a testimonial. A product of the very streets he writes about Ayer wrote one of the better corrupt cop movies ""Training Day"" (2001) and had a hand in two other lesser cop screenplays ""Dark Blue"" (2002) and ""S.W.A.T."" (2003). The technique here is for nearly every shot and situation to get captured by handheld surveillance or mounted squad-car cameras. It sounds like a gimmick but it works beautifully right from the opening moments with a chase through backstreets and alleys that ends in a firefight all caught by a squad car camera. As the daily patrols continue officers Brian Taylor and Mike Zavala share their lives with each other in and out of the squad car. Brian relates his increasing interest in a new woman in his life (Anna Kendrick) while Mike talks about the baby on the way with wife Gabby (Natalie Martinez). They b.s. about all sorts of things with casual loving insults and wisecrack about the dangers they face hourly. The shock of a police movie without a fictional overlay is whats bracing here. As F. Scott Fitzgerald said action is character so you learn about these guys strictly through their actions -- their behavior in extreme situation and instinctual response to provocation. You might tease out a story line about the increasing possibility of a Mexican drug cartel penetrating South Central and the street gang willing to do its dirty work. But even this takes a backseat to the story of a friendship that is vital to the survival of these two peace officers. You could complain about there being too much action. Over the course of the movie these two rescue babies from a burning building confront crackheads find ""missing"" children stop a truck loaded with weaponry uncover a safe house for human trafficking and seize a huge cache of narcotics. On top of all this they learn they may have been targeted for assassination by a Mexican drug cartel a not entirely plausible scenario as any cartel would want to penetrate the L.A. market through stealth rather than screaming headlines. Ayers strategy appears to incorporate about every possible situation cops might encounter during routine watches. The only sense that time is evolving comes with a marriage here or a birth there; otherwise these watches are timeless. Besides the two officers on patrol the film takes in a couple of tough female cops who are no Cagney amp; Lacey in America Ferreras Officer Orozco and Cody Horns Officer Davis; a bitter cop in David Harbours Office Van Hauser; and Frank Grillos ""Sarge"" who tries to play it straight with his officers. On the streets are a believable bunch of gang-bangers for whom life is cheap including their own. Yahira Garcia plays ""La La"" female driver for a gang that includes ""Big Evil"" (Maurice Compte) and ""Demon"" (Richard Cabral). All very scary dudes. Meanwhile Shondrella Avery is a crack-head mother who cant remember where she stashed her children. A real-life mayoral candidate L.A. City Councilman Eric Garcetti gets to audition for that role in a cameo as the mayor during a medal of valor ceremony. Thanks to superb cinematography by Roman Vasyanov that imitates all sorts of photographic devices from night-vision surveillance to the handheld camera Brian takes (illegally) on patrol the action rings true in every instance. There is nothing super human here; no action a cop might not be expected to perform while on watch. One might quarrel with the ending which involves moments that do feel fictional. If so its a small lapse compared to the edge-of-your-seat action that has come before.

"End of Watch | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; end-of-watch ) End of Watch (United States 2012) September 20 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli The problem with End of Watch a gripping police drama is director David Ayers stylistic decision to shoot nearly the entire movie tripod-less. Or to put it another way theres a whole lotta shakin going on. Much of End of Watch could almost fall into the so-called ""found footage"" approach that is a hot trend in horror. Main character Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) is never without his handy digital camera so we often see events through his lens. On other occasions we are presented with the point-of-view of a police car front window cam (this may result in motion sickness for some audience members during car chases). And even when a scene is shot using a more traditional third-person perspective were still in hand-held territory. Its an unwarranted distraction that for some will curtail the potential to experience and enjoy an otherwise finely written and crafted motion picture. David Ayer must love cop films. His previous directorial effort Street Kings was one and his best-known work as a screenwriter Training Day fit into the same category. This time however hes taking a slightly different tact and instead of telling a tale of police corruption and the men who embrace it hes going for something a little less Hollywood. The cops are the good guys hard workers who uphold the law and occasionally when demanded by duty make heroic sacrifices. They love their wives and girlfriends and theres a real sense of camaraderie between them. In addition to a building sense of tension as the narrative moves towards its climax End of Watch boasts surprising emotional heft. This is as much about the humanity of the people in the police cars as it is about the job they do. Jake Gyllenhaal with his skull shaved and Michael Pena with a full head of hair play partners Brian Taylor and Mike Zavala whose beat is the South Central (L.A.) night shift. Most of what they do is routine rescuing children from a burning house investigating a missing persons call responding to noise complaint. But because South Central is a hive of drugs and gang violence theres always an edge of uncertainty. By being too diligent Brian and Mike attract the wrong sort of attention to go along with medals of valor a Mexican drug lord wants them stopped before they can interfere with his distribution plans. Meanwhile both partners experience life changes. Mike and his wife Gabby (Natalie Martinez) welcome their first child and Brian considers marriage to his girlfriend Janet (Anna Kendrick). For a while End of Watch progresses almost like an R-rated episode of Adam 12. Its very much a ""day in the life of"" story detailing the easy conversation that transpires in a squad car between calls and showing the dangers faced by cops even in seemingly unthreatening situations. There are times when the first-person approach works to emphasize intimacy. On other occasions such as a fire rescue it reduces everything into a muddle of confusion. Eventually the main plotline kicks in although we soon realize aspects of it have been present all along. The final 30 minutes are taut and suspenseful and the viewer shouldnt make the mistake of believing events are going to follow a predetermined cop movie path. End of Watch isnt afraid of venturing into dark territory although the way in which Ayer chooses to conclude the film with a much-needed ""lighter moment"" is welcome. Gyllenhaal and Pena make Brian and Mike ordinary down-to-earth guys who love each other and their women. The chemistry between them is natural not forced as is sometimes the case in buddy films. They have the easygoing rapport that comes from long-time familiarity. They talk in shorthand and needle each other mercilessly. When it comes down to it however they have each others backs. Few cop movies spend as much time developing a believable partnership like this and it has a strong payoff in the final act. For those who can handle Ayers overuse of the shaky-cam approach on the big screen End of Watch is satisfying and emotionally potent. Its a good gritty drama of the sort that seems increasingly rare within the thriller genre where visual excess and the adrenaline/testosterone cocktail have become dominant. Even with the distraction caused by the hand-held camera End of Watch offers two hours well-spent.

But ""End of Watch"" only uses the first person approach to frame the familiar dramas of two hackneyed characters cocksure young officers Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Zavala (Michael Pena) as they uncover the dark underbelly of the drug trade in south central L.A. Taylors obsession with filming their exploits provides a handy excuse for the constant shaky cam but director David Ayer often abandons the device for more conventional storytelling an arbitrary decision made worse by a trite screenplay that mainly revolves around the two smarmy men trading barbs as they chase down bad guys and complain about their problems with the opposite sex. While Taylor struggles between his commitment to duty and the pressures of settling down with his newfound love (Anna Kendrick in a one-note role) Zavala waxes poetic on the benefits of family life. Their world grows increasingly claustrophobic the danger quotient rises and everything explodes in a hail of bullets. Overlong and blazingly unoriginal the movie only manages to thunder forward because of its two committed leads whose struggles maintain a certain ferocity even though weve seen them before. By virtue of its style and high stakes scenario ""End of Watch"" is impressively tense but then so are most episodes of ""COPS"" which dont suffer from the forced melodrama found here.

Directed from his own script by Training Day writer David Ayer its also one of the few Ive seen that pay serious attention to what cop life feels like both on and off duty for those who protect and serve the streets of L.A.s danger zone Southland. The representative beat cops here -- sometimes hotshots but nothing like the rogues in Training Day -- are longtime partners Taylor (a toughened buzz-cut Jake Gyllenhaal) and Zavala (an outstanding Michael Pena; see opposite page). Their duties range from the routine to the macabre from the heroic to the tedious. Theyre rowdy when they let off steam and properly scared when they do brave things. Cop work is well served in this tale. One of Taylors rowdier moves is to sneak a discreet HD camera onto the job against department policy to record his day for an extracurricular filmmaking class. That clever narrative twist -- and the jumpy found-footage documentary-style cinematography with which Ayer tells the story -- builds to a powerful conclusion. (The pulsing hip-hop score adds to the adrenaline.) Meanwhile Gyllenhaal and Pena embody brotherly love with an ease that explains why their director was sometimes a bit too reluctant to call ""Cut."" No one wants to end such a beautiful friendship.

The film opens with a high-speed pursuit captured entirely on the built-in camera of the LAPD squad car driven by Officers Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Pena) and the following scene features Brian talking into a video camera about a film project hes doing for school. Lest you think ""End of Watch"" is going to be 2012s umpteenth ""found footage"" movie made up entirely of shaky pixelly shots and actors looking right into the lens the film quickly cuts to an omniscient point of view; from that point on cinematographer Roman Vasyanov occasionally peppers the film with cell-phone footage and surveillance-cam POV without going whole-hog. As a result were spared post-""Blair Witch"" motion sickness but the movie still gets to shoot stock moments like fights and shoot-outs from some unexpected angles. Those angles arent the only twists the film has to offer. ""End of Watch"" may seem like just another movie about the mean streets of South Central and the blue knights that keep the peace but writer-director David Ayer (who previously pounded this beat with ""Street Kings"" ""Harsh Times"" and the screenplay for ""Training Day"") focuses on the characters while slowly and subtly bringing the plot up from the background. Brian and Mike are both good cops and good friends which the film wisely shows rather than tells. Theyre capable of heroics (after they receive commendations for rescuing children from a burning house Brian admits to Mike that he only went in to follow his partner) but they spend much of their days cruising around and goofing on each other in the way that close confidants do. And while we see the two of them experience life both on and off the job -- Mikes wife Gabby (Natalie Martinez) gives birth to their child Brian courts and eventually marries the pretty and intelligent Janet (Anna Kendrick) -- we start to realize that the pairs professional activities have put them in the cross hairs of a very dangerous drug cartel. Ayer masterfully builds tension as the audience comes to understand the peril our heroes are in well before they do. There are some missteps particularly in regard to the ending (which wont be spoiled here) but overall ""End of Watch"" offers up several compelling characters thanks both to Ayers writing and his direction of a very talented cast. Kendrick and Martinez make the most of their secondary roles (and the cops played by America Ferrera David Harbour and Cody Horn are compelling enough to rate their own movie) but this is Gyllenhaal and Penas show all the way. From their hilarious comic chemistry to their commitment to the necessarily darker side of their roles both actors make these boys in blue thoroughly vivid and complex. After decades of gritty and even darkly comic movies and TV shows about the lives of cops on the street its surprising that they can still be surprising. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

"End of Watch review A different hue of blue | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesEnd of Watch review A different hue of blueEnd of Watch begins as just another LAPD cop story and found-footage movie. Writer/director David Ayer delivers something far more interesting.Jake Gyllenhaal left and Michael Pena in End of Watch which takes the cop buddy drama to a new level.  (Scott Garfield photo)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Sept. 20 2012End of Watch (out of 4)Starring Jake Gyllenhaal Michael Pena Anna Kendrick and America Ferrara. Written and directed by David Ayer. 109 minutes. Opens Sept. 21 at major theatres. 18AEnd of Watch sneaks up on you.It begins as just another LAPD cop story something writer/director David Ayer is all too familiar with having written Training Day and directed Harsh Times and Street Kings.Article Continued BelowIt also starts as just another found-footage conceit. Jake Gyllenhaals Officer Brian Taylor is packing tiny cameras one for him and one for his patrol partner Officer Mike Zavala (Michael Pena). Ex-Marine Taylor is studying film at night school and he wants to make a video -- in defiance of police rules -- on what its really like patrolling L.A.s rock-hard South Central hood.Thankfully you dont have to get too far into End of Watch before it changes into something far more interesting a buddy story of two good cops who are just trying to do the right thing albeit with a little on-the-job improvising.""Try not to kill anybody before end of watch"" a superior says as Taylor and Zavala are assigned to the South Central patrol.Easier said than done. Crime is so rampant in the citys toughest division even the good cops have to turn a blind eye to petty offenses because theres too much really bad stuff going down to keep them occupied.But Taylor and Zavala are nothing if not game joking about how getting their daily bread involves chasing and busting ""all the food groups dope money and guns."" The film plays at times like an extended version of TVs COPS (and also the old Adam-12) but this is no knock against it. And the found-footage thing is all but forgotten before long.The two partners dont immediately seem like a great match. High-strung Taylor is used to doing things his own way and hell barrel into a situation without much forethought. A bachelor hes pretty cavalier about women too although hes found an interesting match in new gal Janet (Anna Hendrick).Zavala is an easygoing family guy with a pregnant wife (Natalie Martinez) and many other relations to keep him busy and in line. This doesnt mean hes not willing to rock n roll when occasion demands as it frequently does. Like Taylor hes ready to flash the badge cock the gun and pound the fist especially if it means backing his partner.The dedication to their jobs and to each other is really put to the test when they run afoul of drug lords during a routine traffic stop and a twisted sense of neighbourhood pride becomes a vow to exact revenge.After so many films not just Ayers where LAPD cops are depicted as corrupt homicidal or suicidal its refreshing to see one where the boys in blue really are the good guys for a change.And also the girls in blue. America Ferrera and Cody Horn play fellow LAPD officers who have seen it all too including someone getting a knife to the eye in a scene that would almost be comical if it werent so horrifying.Like Taylor and Zavala they struggle to maintain a separation between their lives in uniform and their lives out of it.""You got a soul?"" someone asks them.""Yeah we just leave it at home"" comes the reply.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet As a screenwriter David Ayer has long been obsessed with the slippery line separating cops from criminals and good cops from their corrupt brethren. He explored the theme in a glorified B-movie that became the foundation for a blockbuster franchise (The Fast And The Furious) a film where he shares a screenwriting credit with author James Ellroy (Dark Blue) and a morally ambiguous cop drama (Training Day) that won Denzel Washington his second Oscar. Ayer made his directorial debut with Harsh Times an intense drama about a PTSD-afflicted veteran (Christian Bale) who wants to become a cop but instead becomes a psychotic criminal. And he followed it with the corrupt-cop drama Street Kings from a screenplay once again co-written by Ellroy. Sticking with the theme Ayers latest End Of Watch concerns renegade cops who chase death every time they begin a shift. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena star as hotheaded young policemen who blur a lot of rules they dont outright break in patrolling some of Los Angeles most violent neighborhoods. Their reckless existence is perilous enough even before they stumble upon a massive conspiracy that endangers their lives. A criminally underutilized Anna Kendrick costars as the tough confident woman who finally tames Gyllenhaal Her lively intelligence and playful sexuality enliven every scene shes in lending personality to a film that too often borders on generic. End Of Watch initially seems intent on shaking up the tired-renegade-cop genre by having Gyllenhaal furtively film his experiences as part of a college filmmaking class. That potentially interesting new wrinkle barely factors into most of the proceedings however especially toward the end. Like Ayers previous directorial efforts End Of Watch has a nice feel for the color and flavor of Los Angeles as well as the heightened emotions and brotherly solidarity engendered by confronting inner-city horrors day in and day out. Gyllenhaal and Penas relationship a sort of heterosexual love affair is depicted with a sense of tenderness and care that does not extend to the cartoonish villains that dominate the films lackluster final act. End Of Watch is Ayers third consecutive directorial exploration of hard living and moral corruption on the mean streets of Los Angeles but by the time it lumbers to a close the disappointingly TV-sized film feels less like the resolution of a de facto trilogy than like a rerun limply recycling characters and situations that have been more compellingly dramatized in countless other films and television shows including Ayers own obsessive monomaniacal oeuvre.

As an adult his Hollywood calling card was the screenplay for Training Day (2001) in which Denzel Washington played a corrupt South Central cop. For End of Watch his third film as writer-director Ayer has gone home yet again and as in his previous work one gets the sense of a skilled craftsman who has learned everything he knows about the hood not from firsthand experience but from going to the movies. And so it is that the daily routine of street cops Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Pena) includes encounters with drug-addled parents who brutalize their kids a nightgown-clad black mother screaming ""My babies My babies"" in front of her burning house and Latina gang girls who literally cackle as they kill. As social insight End of Watch is useless but as engrossing entertainment its irresistible thanks to Ayers gift for dialogue the relentless pacing set by film editor Dody Dorn and gorgeous performances by Gyllenhaal and Pena whose chemistry contains the elements essential to a classic screen teaming raucous humor erotic tension and a hint of the miraculous.

End of Watch Good Director David Ayer. Cast Jake Gyllenhaal Michael Pena Anna Kendrick. Rating R for strong violence some disturbing images pervasive language including sexual references and some drug use. Not so. Writer and director David Ayer manages to overcome the shortcomings of the genre many of which are present here with great chemistry between his actors and sheer momentum. The film starts with a car chase that leads to a gunbattle and only slows down for quips between Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena as two LAPD officers working a particularly tough neighborhood. That first incident is shot through the dashboard camera on their police cruiser just one of several ways Ayer comes up with reasons for such footage to exist. Yes using found footage to stitch together a plot got old by the time the credits for ""Cloverfield"" rolled. Yet while Ayer necessarily cheats here and there showing us things that couldnt be filmed by participants for the most part he comes up with plausible ways to show us whats going on through the lens of a camera. Its meant to lend a sense of realism to the film and it works as does most everything in the movie. Brian (Gyllenhaal) and Mike (Pena) are partners the ones captured in the footage that opens the film. Their shooting of suspects is deemed justified and just the start of an unusually large number of incidents with which they will be involved. (The number of life-threatening and heroic calls they answer is the one thing that rings false in the movie.) They have an easy rapport constantly busting each others chops. But as Brian says in a voiceover he would lay down his life for any of his fellow officers and they him. The voiceover is part of a film class hes taking as a pre-law elective and gives him an excuse to tote a camera around all day (or when need be clip a small one to his uniform). Its not all police work. Along the way Mike and his wife Gabby (Natalie Martinez) have a baby and Brian starts dating Janet (Anna Kendrick). The women mostly fit the role of Worried Significant Other found in this type of film but they do a good job of it. The real action of course is on the job. An especially lucrative bust made when Brian insists on doing a little detective work that is outside the scope of their duties angers a dangerous Mexican cartel and that is not a good thing. Theres a great scene in which an ICE agent tells Brian and Mike after a bust to get lost they have the scene now. Why Brian asks? You dont even have enough clearance to be having this conversation the ICE agent replies. But as a favor he tips Brian off that the cartel is ruthless and Brian and Mike need to lie low. Of course telling two gung-ho LAPD cops to take it easy is like asking the elephant to pass the peanuts. Its not in their makeup. And to his credit Ayer who wrote ""Training Day"" and wrote and directed ""Street Kings"" does not skimp on the danger to his protagonists. This lends the movie an almost unbearable tension near the end as we more so than Brian and Mike wonder and worry about whats around every corner. The answer? Nothing good. The action and the chemistry is stronger than the story because Gyllenhaal and Pena are good. In that respect ""End of Watch"" works better as a series of vignettes held together somewhat loosely by a larger story. But it does work and given all the places it could have gone wrong but didnt thats quite an accomplishment. End of Watch  Director David Ayer. Cast Jake Gyllenhaal Michael Pena Anna Kendrick.

Taylor is conveniently taking a filmmaking class hence all the on-the-street verite and soulful direct addresses about a flatfoots forlorn life. But our hero isnt the only one with a camera There are some warring gangbangers out in the Southland who also like recording their exploits--or at least their f-bomb-laced tirades--and they dont take it too kindly when the heat crosses them. Ayer clearly thinks hes making a grittily realistic ode to the long arm of the law yet only the more intimate scenes ring true. End of Watchs best moments are those between Gyllenhaal and Pena as they riff extensively while driving the beat--though their rapport feels like it comes more from offscreen personal regard than anything in the direction or screenplay. The first-person aesthetic meanwhile quickly becomes tiresome and Ayer abandons the technique whenever he paints himself into a narrative corner. It almost becomes comical to count the number of ""whos holding the camera now?"" reverse shots that the filmmaker haphazardly inserts to propel the story forward. Such visual ineptitude like much else in this tediously cocky enterprise is downright criminal.

TWITTER David Ayer returns to his home turf with a Jake Gyllenhaal-led pro-cop story set in South Central Los Angeles. TORONTO -- David Ayers South Central-set cop film End of Watch feels like the work of a man who after relishing venal and brutal policework in his scripts for Training Day and Dark Blue has come to identify with and maybe love the L.A.P.D. Here L.A.s finest may work in a world of cut corners and bad attitudes but theyre the good guys and damned if youre not going to accept it. Vigorously capturing the tension of walking into situations that could be deadly horrifying or both it has a strong commercial appeal despite some shortcomings. Its hard at first to figure out what Ayer thinks of his protagonist Officer Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) a macho ""ghetto street cop"" whose plan to make a documentary about life on the force (he carries a camera along on his beat and in the police house to the chagrin of colleagues) looks less journalistic than narcissistic. The voiceover with which he opens End of Watch starts off street-tough then pivots ""beyond my badge is a heart like yours"" he says continuing to speak of his inner yearnings. David Sardys score turns melodramatic alongside him sounding like ironic commentary on this self-aggrandizement but eventually its clear Ayers film buys what Taylors selling. Viewers may too as Gyllenhaal thoroughly inhabits this problematic personality. PHOTOS THR and Samsung Host End of Watch Screening Michael Penas Officer Zavala though matching his partner for general wiseassery has a much smaller chip on his shoulder. (As in World Trade Center where he was married to a Gyllenhaal instead of manning a squad car with one Pena shows he has mastered the ""Latino partner loyal to Caucasian hero"" role. Its time for him to graduate.) Having just returned from leave after killing two subjects in the course of duty (it was a clean shooting everyone agrees) Taylor and Zavala are even higher-profile at the precinct house than usual. A pair of no-nonsense female cops (America Ferrera and Cody Horn) resent their attitude; a disgruntled veteran (David Harbour) resents their self-satisfaction. But though the energy and direction of some patrol encounters might have viewers expecting these cops to be (or soon become) involved in something crooked the worst you can say about them is like practically every cop in film history they dont play by the rules. Here ignoring the rules -- following up on leads that should be passed along to detectives -- opens a window into the grisly north-of-the-border activities of a Mexican drug cartel. ""The cartels"" hover unseen above the action here (until the third act) raising a question If they decide to expand their presence can they wreak as much havoc in the States as they have in Mexico? Nobody voices that concern but way they say the words suggests they dont assume an easy victory. VIDEO End of Watch Trailer Jake Gyllenhaal Michael Pena are Endangered L.A. Cops While we dont see the cartels we do meet some American aspirants to their level of terror-fueled success as the film eavesdrops on some Latino youths called the Curbside Gang. If these killers look more like sketches for post-Cartel gang stereotypes instead of believable humans that irritant is compounded by the fact that they too are filming everything they do. Scenes of self-documentation are so common in the movies beginning (is End of Watch a misnomer when everybodys watching himself?) that we expect Ayer to make something of it in the end. Ayer drops that ball if he ever meant to carry it somewhere. And in the last 15 minutes of the film he burns up some of the credibility he established by not pushing extreme situations too far earlier on. But he has managed to involve us in the lives of his characters -- whose storylines may be familiar (as in Taylors romance with smart outsider Janet played charmingly by Anna Kendrick) but are played out in a world that for the most part feels real.

Like a knife in the eye ""End of Watch"" cuts past the cliches of standard police procedurals serving instead as a visceral ride-along with two thrill-seeking cops (Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena both terrific) covertly documenting their beat in South Central L.A. Faux-found-footage approach already feels a little dated but amplifies the authenticity in what feels like a cross between ""Cops"" and first-person shooter-style vidgames. Sincerely dedicated ""for all that fight evil so we may not know it"" David Ayers moving tribute to the men in blue should earn its share of green once word of mouth kicks in. Opening with a high-speed pursuit shot through the windshield of an LAPD squad car the pic slams auds into the shoes of officers Brian Taylor (Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Pena) longtime partners sworn to protect and to serve one of the Southlands most dangerous neighborhoods. After the chase ends in a shooting the pair is reassigned to a new inner-city zone and advised ""Try not to kill anyone by the end of the week."" Given Ayers past credits on such dirty-cop pics as ""Training Day"" and ""Harsh Times"" one could reasonably assume that these two rule-benders might go rogue when Sarge (Frank Grillo) isnt looking. Far from it. While the two dont exactly play things by the book Ayer presents them as unsung heroes justifying the power trip they both get from their badges -- an attitude echoed via the films macho rap soundtrack -- by demonstrating in one situation after another how sincerely they intend to be a force for good. In one scene running on Red Bull and barely able to keep their eyes open at the end of a long shift Taylor and Zavala spot a burning house and call in the situation. When their fire-fighting associates fail to arrive in time Zavala doesnt hesitate to act risking his own life to rescue three children from the blaze. As always Taylor has his back every step of the way. Such a connection between cops is hardly unique according to Ayer epic poet of the LAPD who sings the departments feats and failures in film after film. Whether they are teasing one another on the job -- so poignantly captured in the final scene -- or hanging out with their respective lady friends (Natalie Martinez plays Zavalas pregnant wife while Anna Kendrick aces the danger-drawn thrill of Taylors latest ""badge bunny"") a bond like this goes beyond brotherhood to the point that either officer would lay down his life for his partner. Eventually as the title implies both will be given precisely that chance. To raise the stakes further Taylor carries a small handheld HD camera everywhere also rigging his uniform with a recording device that allows him to surreptitiously document his adventures as a cop. Given the LAPDs skittishness around cameras after the Rodney King incident Taylor seems to be begging for trouble. ""You know theyre gonna subpoena that shit if something goes sideways"" a female colleague warns -- one of several role-model-making distaff parts through which America Ferrera and Cody Horn demonstrate that however dangerous law enforcement isnt an exclusively male domain. For the sake of the films heightened ""reality"" however Ayer has conceived Taylor as an obstinate ex-Marine taking a filmmaking class on the side and if disobeying the departments orders by documenting his work is the characters worst infraction then perhaps good cops still exist. At the macro level ""End of Watch"" affords the LAPD the respectful portrayal the U.S. military seeks when partnering with Hollywood Instead of glorifying the individual the film depicts an honorable and efficient organization of people working together. This is apparent in not only David Harbours small but crucial contribution as an all-business cop who doesnt even bat an eye after sustaining a show-stopping injury on duty but also Taylor and Zavalas split-second response to the situation passing up the arguably justifiable opportunity to kill the sadistic perp on the spot. With an ear for the vernacular and an eye for intense but unglamorized violence Ayer depicts the way well-trained professionals boiling over with both adrenaline and ego respond to potentially life-threatening situations incorporating footage from other cameras including chilling ""top-secret"" surveillance video and clips pulled from an iPhone-documented drive-by. Ultimately the mock-doc device works because Gyllenhaal and Pena so completely reinvent themselves in-character. Instead of wearing the roles like costumes or uniforms they let the job seep into their skin a feat without which ""End of Watchs"" pseudo-reality never would have worked.

They protect they serve they provide us with endless hours of entertainment. Theyre the cops and if you are a dramatic actor it is inevitable that one day you will play one. ""End of Watch"" is Jake Gyllenhaals turn and no matter how many pushups he does or how closely he shaves his head my disbelief can only be suspended so far. No cop has gorgeous baby blues and a shayna punim like that at least not the ones ""pushing a black and white"" through the sanguine streets of South Central. Its a small but annoying problem one of a number that prevent David Ayers buddy drama back from any true significance. As it stands it merely wavers between interesting and modestly engaging. Brothers-in-arms pics are nothing new but ""End of Watch"" wants you to tell you again and again just how much police partners rely respect and indeed sacrifice for one another. The film light on plot is essentially a collection of ride-alongs. Gyllenhaal and his partner the ceaselessly entertaining Michael Pena gab in the car cajoling one another with lighthearted ethnic ribs and lay their emotions bare in a way thats open and honest but never fruity. They are good scenes -- well acted and while perhaps sparing in the bon mots department the writing evokes a verisimilitude through coarseness. (Few on the force bother to shout ""Language"" these days.) Also Check Out Stars Take the Red Carpet at the 2012 Toronto Film Festival Sprinkled between the shaggy dog two-handers are moments in which we are forced to take a good hard look at the indignity of the street. Each peek into a spare room or closet is a grotesque example of mans inhumanity to man. Its horrible and no doubt very true but the fact that each new scene arrives on queue like a musical number and feels the need to escalate things found this reviewer by the end rolling his eyes. Man you thought THOSE guys had no sanctity for human life? You aint seen NOTHIN yet A slim narrative is fastened to ""End of Watch"" and unfortunately it does it little service. For starters Gyllenhaal is taking film classes so hes always shooting footage for ""a project."" Much of whats on screen is ""found footage"" but not all of it. Thats annoying to me. Also this film class lasts long enough for him to meet a girl (Anna Kendrick) marry her and get her pregnant. Thats annoying too as is the fact that Kendricks character has zero depth other than ""cute"" and it strikes me as very unlikely that shed ever date a cop. Gyllenhaal and Penas daily encounters have them at the periphery of a major African-American vs. Mexican turf war (""There used to be chicken stands Now there are taco stands"") Since our pair are awesome they keep stumbling into major busts. The big finish (and the closest thing to a traditional story beat) has the South of the Border boss ordering a hit which is filmed like a first-person shooter. Its implied that Gyllenhaal a former marine may have PTSD or anger issues or a blatant disregard of due process... but this isnt developed. I have a hunch Ayer thinks of this gray area as a selling point but it feels unusually subtle to me -- it doesnt fit with the loud-mouth hand-held vibe of the rest of the film. ""End of Watch"" if you compare it to an average episode of say ""Criminal Minds"" is pretty good. You dont have tears in your eyes by the big blood-soaked ending you dont have feelings. Im simply unsure of what this movies point is. Id like to say its a genuine slice-of-life drama but then why the forced antagonists? Why a bad guy almost as laugh-inducing as Bane? If cop stories are your thing you may find some extra merit in this film based on an interest in the subject matter. Others may simply be anticipating the ""End of Watch.""
