A full-blown fantasy-action adventure that also strenuously underscores the importance of family ""Spy Kids"" is determined to take no prisoners in the under-12 demographic a goal it sometimes dazzlingly achieves. Robert Rodriguezs film in which two kids become real spies to save the world from a mad genius fulfills kids empowerment fantasies and features enough techno-wizardry and cool f/x to satisfy those weaned on videogames. With a dearth of similar products in the marketplace heavily promotable pic should enjoy a robust theatrical release. This 007-for-kids item quotes freely from films that have gone before it blending elements of the Bond franchise ""Austin Powers"" superhero movies and a smattering of colorful ""Willy Wonka"" allusions. But it also manages to be original given that its largely inspired by Rodriguezs own fantasies and childhood drawings. At the outset Gregorio Cortez (Antonio Banderas) and wife Ingrid (Carla Gugino) are quietly raising their two young children Carmen (Alexa Vega) and Juni (Daryl Sabara). Pre-adolescent Carmen loathes her boring family and yearns to run away while the shy nervous Juni suffers from warts caused by his constantly sweating hands. Forced to find their fun vicariously the kids dream of a more exciting life They pass their time watching their favorite TV variety show ""Floops Fooglies"" hosted by childrens TV personality Fegan Floop (Alan Cumming) who surprise turns out to be more than just a showman. Unbeknownst to their kids Ingrid and Gregorio were once secret agents. Lured out of retirement on a top-secret mission to rescue several kidnapped spies Ingrid and Gregorio leave their kids with family friend Felix Gumm (Cheech Marin). But when Red Alert sirens begin to blare and black-clad baddies surround the Cortez home Felix tells the kids that their parents may be in jeopardy quickly showing them how to make a getaway in a hidden escape pod. Feeling newly important Carmen and Juni set off to save their parents. From here ""Spy Kids"" turbo-boosts into a rainbow-colored flight of fantasy and adventure. Rodriguez himself dreamed up most of the films gadgets including a fish-shaped submarine pod that can be transformed into a boat a kid-sized spy plane that can circle the globe in minutes a high-tech device that can pinpoint the location of anybody on Earth and tool belts filled with electroshock bubble gum and acid crayons. Cary Whites production design of sets and gadgets is imaginative and cartoonishly inspired. After finding a secret safe house where they arm themselves with gadgets and briefly fight off a double-crossing agent (Teri Hatcher speaking of Bond references) the kids set out for Floops castle where their parents are incarcerated. Floop and his henchman Alexander Minion (Tony Shalhoub) have hatched a plan for global domination that involves cloning the kids of celebrities and world leaders and implanting them with programmable brains. But its doubtful that kids will care as much about the plot with its elaborate backstory numerous red herrings and doppelganger villains as they will the eye-popping f/x and kids-as-superspies conceit. What their parents will care most about by contrast is the films moral coda which loudly affirms that family members need to stick together and support each other. Its a valid point of course but the message smacks of a pointed riposte to those who claim that Hollywood has desecrated family values. On a technical level ""Spy Kids"" is top notch. Kid-friendly tone is maintained through Guillermo Navarros lensing and musical selections including tracks by Danny Elfman Los Lobos and Rodriguez. Spy KidsProductionA Dimension Films release.

(Dimension Films) Imagine a James Bond movie made for a 10-year-old. What would that be? Well it would just be a James Bond movie. Okay. So now imagine a James Bond movie made for a 5-year-old and thats how you get ""Spy Kids"" written and directed by Robert Rodriguez (""El Mariachi"") which takes the Bond gestalt and infantilizes it even further. A question arises Do we reach a point of diminishing returns? Is there a moment after which this idea can be infantilized no further? I would have thought so but clearly Rodriguez is much smarter for hes actually brought it off a swirling whirligig of an international spy thriller in which our heroes the kids save those two helpless old doddering fogies Mom and Dad (and also I guess the world). Plus they set Teri Hatchers hair on fire. Rodriguez has two things going for him. First as his work for adults has shown he has one of those natural senses of film kinesthetics (James Cameron has it too; so I think does Spielberg). He thinks in terms of movement and he has a capacity to throw images together in highly refined skeins capable of fooling you into believing anything. He did it in ""Desperado"" that goofball remake of his own ""El Mariachi"" in which Antonio Banderas regularly killed dozens and dozens of Mexican bad guys in bars and you actually swallowed it. And he does it here continually. The second - this is new to Rodriguezs oeuvre - he has an endless visual bounty. Where he comes up with these gimcracks and gizmos I wouldnt know but some of them are lulus. My favorite after Teris flaming hair was a kid-size jet plane an extremely convincing movie illusion. Rodriguez said that he wanted to make a movie he could take his three kids to and yet enjoy himself and I would say he has come quite close. Retired international spies Gregorio Cortez (Banderas) and Ingrid Cortez (Carla Gugino) live happily in a modest 10 million mansion overlooking the Pacific happily raising their two kids Carmen (Alexa Vega) and Juni (Daryl Sabara) who have become devotees of the Fegan Floop TV show. What they dont know is that Fegan Floop (Alan Cumming) is actually a front for a secret think tank that has been hired to construct an army of robot kids through which the noncreative can take over the world. Where have they been? The noncreative took over the world years ago. Well the only thing missing is a brain and the only one who has designed a brain for this army is Gregorio. So you can see where this one is headed The bad guys led by Hatcher kidnap the adults in order to get the brain. The two kids who thought their parents were boring icky old dorks have got to save them by penetrating the secret complex. That complex is particularly impressive; its the Wicked Witchs castle as imagined by someone whos looked at too many M.C. Escher prints. As a piece of almost dadaist filmmaking ""Spy Kids"" is great fun with its continual spirit of invention. Rodriguez hopes to reach children with his myth of childhood empowerment and adults with his hip movie stylings sending up old favorites as he goes along. ""Spy Kids"" (88 minutes) is rated PG for cartoonish violence.

So it makes sense that he being such a busy fellow might forget a few things -- such as most of the characters who made his first two films so delightful. Where the heck is Fegan Floop (Alan Cumming shown briefly in to-die-for purple velvet)? Or Dinky Winks (Bill Paxton likewise in a dont-look-down-at-your-popcorn-or-youll-miss-him cameo)? Or mad scientist Romeo (Steve Buscemi ditto)? Or Dad (Antonio Banderas) and Mom (Carla Gugino) who show up only in the last few minutes despite their star billing? Or for that matter big sister Carmen (Alexa Vega now a lovely teen) who goes missing for the first hour of the movie? Surely all these peoples agents cant be that difficult to get on the phone. Anyway go ahead and call this one ""Spy Kid"" because its all about young Juni Cortez (Daryl Sabara) who must enter the worlds most difficult 3-D video game to rescue Carmen who is trapped inside. (Thats the story but I think shes just off at the prom.) In he goes and on go our special 3-D glasses for a whooshing ride. ""Spy Kids 3D Game Over"" View trailer 1/2 With Antonio Banderas Carla Gugino Alexa Vega Daryl Sabara Ricardo Montalban Sylvester Stallone. Written and directed by Robert Rodriguez. 84 minutes. Rated PG for action sequences and peril. Several theaters. At a time when so many movies feel like video games (""Charlies Angels"" Im looking at you) its refreshing to find one that does it intentionally and ""Spy Kids 3D"" really does capture that grayish darkness and hyperreal zippy movement of a game. Unfortunately for those who like a plot along with their car races and lava surfing its game over quickly. Juni accompanied by his grandfather (Ricardo Montalban amused and paternal) competes in a series of eye-popping tests but theres a sameness to it all that makes the films 84 minutes seem longer. But kids especially the sort who cant put down their GameBoys may not be too picky about this and Rodriguezs wild imagination offers much to perk things up. Who knew for example that if you take Sylvester Stallone de-puff his face and play him at a slightly faster speed you get ... a Very Well-Known Actor who makes an amusing cameo here. Salma Hayek turns up as a sexily pigtailed secret agent (yes somehow she makes the look work) and Elijah Wood glows like a supernatural hobbit in his brief appearance. And as for the 3D technology -- well outside of an IMAX theater this is about as good as it gets. (Note to parents You might want to grab an extra pair of the cardboard glasses as kids can and will break their first pair more quickly than you ever thought possible. Never mind how I learned this.) Though the film has a few ""glasses off"" stretches most of it is in cartoony jump-off-the-screen 3D which has the strange effect of making the likes of Stallone look even less real and may result in mild headaches for grown-up folk. You can of course watch the movie without the glasses but it has a blurry unpleasant glare. ""Spy Kids 3D"" even with its disappointments has more energy and vividness than most kids fare. But its great strength -- the bond the kids have with their loving family -- is very much watered-down here despite a ""to family"" ending thats right out of ""Moonstruck."" Rodriguez has announced that this is the final ""Spy Kids"" installment; too bad he wasnt fully on top of his game.

Handout Photo Juni and Carmen (Daryl Sabara and Alexa Vega) have to become spies in order to save their parents in ""Spy Kids. Handout Photo THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT / Rodriguez makes delightful imaginative action film a family affair 1 / 1 Back to Gallery SPY KIDS Action comedy. Starring Antonio Banderas Carla Gugino Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara. Directed by Robert Rodriguez. (PG. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. . ""Spy Kids"" is a successful attempt at a new kind of childrens picture. Its not about a dog. Its not about a wizard. It has the pace of an action movie and the immediacy and spectacle of a video game. Yet theres nothing in it that cant be seen by young children. Its entertaining and inoffensive a rare combination in kids films which are usually neither. ""Spy Kids"" is such a realized work of the imagination that watching it one might figure the movie to be an adaptation of a long-running childrens show or comic strip. It has the feel of something that has been around for years that has acquired layers to it. In fact the movie sprang from a single imagination -- that of writer-director Robert Rodriguez. Rodriguez is not the first name people would typically think of for a childrens film. This is after all the man who brought us ""El Mariachi"" (violent) ""Desperado"" (way violent) ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" (violent and disgusting) and ""The Faculty"" (violent and underrated). Yet at his best Rodriguez has always had a visual gift a flair for the color and rhythm of sequences and he puts this talent to its ultimate use in ""Spy Kids."" The audience knows its in good hands from the first minutes. Carla Gugino plays Ingrid the mother of Carmen (Alexa Vega) and Juni (Daryl Sabara) who ask to be put to bed one night with a story. She tells them a tale of two warring spies who fall in love and as she speaks we see in flashback that she is in fact telling her own story and that of her husband Gregorio Cortez (Antonio Banderas). The fun starts when Ingrid and Gregorio decide to come out of retirement for a spy mission but are captured immediately. Thats when Carmen and Juni find out that Mom and Dad arent just ""consultants"" but spies. In order to save them the kids have to become spies too. With that elegantly spare thread of story Rodriguez constructs a series of amusing scenes and situations. Alan Cumming plays Fegan Floop a criminal mastermind who has figured out a way to ""transmogrify"" secret agents into colorful and distorted Peter Max-like creatures who say everything backward and in a high-pitched voice. Floop lives in a palace filled with virtual rooms from which he broadcasts his No. 2-rated childrens show. Most movies seem as if the filmmakers had just enough ideas to get by. ""Spy Kids"" is rich with ideas and gadgetry and filled with a sense of fun. When the kids get to a safe house they load up on electroshock gum and lasers in the form of crayons. They drive speedboats that turn into submarines. They fly planes and even dart through the sky with jet packs. Carmen carries Juni then drops him then has to dive straight down and grab him before he hits the ground. The movies effects are beautifully realized. An army of thumb people guard Floops palace. They have thumb heads thumb bodies and thumb legs. Also guarding Floop are robot kids who look just like regular children but are machines capable of punching through stone walls. Everything in ""Spy Kids"" is brightly colored even the chains Floop uses to bind Ingrid and Gregorio to their chairs. Cumming is as one might expect a delight as the fey and self-satisfied Floop and Gugino and Banderas look great which is about the whole game in roles such as these. The kids are the pleasant surprise. Vega manages to play the impatient older sister without acting like a smart aleck and Sabara brings a sweetness to Juni. He plays it like a timid spacey kid. Ultimately ""Spy Kids"" is affirming of families and sibling relations. It also affirms Rodriguezs talent. Before ""Spy Kids"" it was possible to regard him as flashy but empty slick but heartless. Its nice to find out otherwise.

(Dimension Films) Someone please pull the plug on digitally generated wonder. I hate to look a gift-horse in the mouth. How often do you get ambitiously mounted movies for young viewers? Robert Rodriguezs ""Spy Kids"" a spin on such family entertainments as ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" by way of James Bond is energetic and slickly done but also somewhat soulless. This PG-rated adventure is loaded down with special-effects creations such as giant ambulatory thumbs and submarines shaped like goldfish. But those effects are too glossy and perfect to be true too computerized to feel even like innocent fantasy. And the central story about a family learning to love and trust one another seems merely tacked on for good measure. Writer-director Rodriguez once made an ingenious low-tech no-budget movie known as ""El Mariachi."" Even though his motivation is good - to make a razzle-dazzle film for young audiences - hes gone too far in the other direction. He forgot to program charm into his cutting-edge storytelling. Gregorio (Antonio Banderas) and Ingrid (Carla Gugino) Cortez are former super-secret agents who have retired to raise their children. A onetime husband-and-wife professional duo they have never told their children about their past. So the Cortez kids 12-year-old daughter Carmen (Alexa Vega) and younger brother Juni (Daryl Sabara) think their parents are uncool nerds. But a secret agent never really leaves the profession. Gregorio and Ingrid get back into the thick of things when Fegan Floop (Alan Cumming) a popular childrens television show host kidnaps several agents of OSS - the Cortezes erstwhile employer. It seems Floop and his associate Minion (Tony Shalhoub) financed by nasty Mr. Lisp (Robert Patrick) intend to mutate these agents into buffoonish squiggly headed characters known as Fooglies (who appear on Floops show). They also plan to create a master race of robotic children designed to resemble and replace the kids of leaders around the world. But when Gregorio and Ingrid go after the bad guys theyre kidnapped too leaving their unknowing children in the lurch. Briefed about the situation by a family friend (Cheech Marin) and aided by their fathers gadget-making brother (Danny Trejo) Carmen and Juni decide to rescue their parents. It turns out those video games theyve played over the years have prepared the kids perfectly for this mission. Theyll be driving such futuristic machines as a Spy Pod a fish-like sub that can skim the surface of the ocean or plunge into its depths; and theyll be using all manner of James Bondian gizmos including jet packs and electroshock bubblegum. Well this all sounds like a great movie doesnt it? Especially when the spy kids infiltrate Floops Castle a fantasy citadel full of Floops creations including Thumb-Thumbs giant robotic creations who are literally all thumbs. But theres so much going on - in terms of special effects - that the human characters seem like mere props. And theres very little acting magic or funniness among the kids or adults. There is no working actor more tedious to watch at present than Cumming who has rapidly become a one-dimensional villain for hire. (His role as General Batista in the atrocious ""Company Man"" illustrates how low he has fallen.) And Teri Hatcher who plays a narratively superfluous heavy known as Mrs. Gradenko doesnt fare much better. The phrase ""special effects"" seems to have lost its meaning. Now theyre par for the course. Maybe the industry can learn a thing or two from ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" where special effects were done the old-fashioned way with wires and visual sleight of hand. Maybe theyll realize that rolling out the computer graphic machinery is only half the battle.""Spy Kids"" (PG 89 minutes) - Contains naughty language and cartoonish violence.
