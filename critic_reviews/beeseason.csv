Mercifully by the time the state competitions looming her ambitious teacher father (Gere) dreaming of raising another rare Jewish mystic; her haunted scientist mother (Binoche); and her elder brother (Minghella) are drifting dramatically apart fuelled by the childs success and by their own needs specifically in terms of belief systems. Shadowed by memories of Vertigo and Three Colours Blue Binoches character is underwritten and least well served notwithstanding a fine performance; the other actors are likewise good but confounded by this very ambitious imaginative and perceptive film never finally managing to tie its many intriguing threads into a fully satisfying whole.

Orange mans 2nd trial nets life term in killing - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Sentence Orange mans 2nd trial nets life term in killingJuly 10 2009|By Sarah Lundy and Amy L. Edwards Sentinel Staff WritersA judge sentenced a 22-year-old Orange County man to life in prison without parole Thursday in a 2006 fatal shooting during a drug deal gone wrong.Deangelo Conner was convicted last month of first-degree murder armed robbery and two counts of robbery with a firearm.Florida law required Circuit Judge Bob Wattles to sentence Conner to life in prison for the murder conviction.Conner had turned down a 25-year plea offer and took his chances at trial.His first trial ended in a mistrial after jurors were heard discussing the case before it was allowed.Authorities say Conner shot Ricardo Rivera 41 once in the chest July 6 2006.Conner and two others initially set up the meeting as a drug buy but they never intended to pay for anything the prosecution said; the three planned to grab the drugs and run.At one point Conner pulled out a gun and fired at Rivera. Conner told investigators that Rivera was charging toward him and he was merely protecting himself.The jury didnt buy it.Several of Ricardo Riveras relatives attended the sentencing including his children and brother Robert Rivera who read statements from several people.In a statement Ricardo Riveras ex-wife wrote that the hardest thing she has had to do was tell her children they no longer had a father.The woman wrote that her familys hurt will never go away.

"Bee Season | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; bee-season ) Bee Season (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli It would be unfair and inaccurate to refer to Bee Season as ""another dysfunctional family drama"" although in essence thats what it is. Adapting from Myla Goldbergs novel co-directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel (The Deep End) have fashioned a film that traverses an unusual path through the minefield of a splintering family. In addition to spelling bees (which the title alludes to) Bee Season explores Jewish mysticism mental illness and the Hare Krishna religion (which may be making its first screen appearance since Airplane). In the end it all seems too much for one small movie to contain. Parts of Bee Season work better than others but I left the theater feeling more like I had watched the outline of a movie than been immersed in a fully realized motion picture. The essence of Bee Season can be distilled into two main themes. The first which focuses on the lack of communication between members of the Naumann family is presented effectively. When we first meet this four-person clan - father Saul (Richard Gere) mother Mimi (Juliette Binoche) son Aaron (Max Minghella) and daughter Eliza (Flora Cross) - they appear to be a well-adjusted upper middle class Jewish family. Gradually however the cracks appear and each misstep by one of the Naumanns widens the gaps. It doesnt take long before we understand that these people do not understand the art of communication despite their fascination with words. When Flora wins a school spelling bee she would rather slip a letter under her fathers study door than tell him the news in person. Aaron is reluctant to introduce his new girlfriend Chali (Kate Bosworth) to his family or reveal his intention to join the Hare Krishnas. Mimi who teeters on the brink of madness has been keeping a secret from Saul for the entirety of their married life. Simple conversations about anything of substances is beyond these people. And Saul is blissfully unaware that something is wrong until the house of cards collapses. Unfortunately the films approach to theology is unconvincing. Saul is obsessed with the Kabbalah. Not only does he teach a religious studies course about the subject at Berkeley where he is a professor but he devotes a portion of his private time to its study. When he believes that Floras amazing aptitude with spelling may offer a conduit to God (""words and letters hold all the secrets of the universe"") he takes a sudden interest in his daughter whom he had previously barely acknowledged. Indeed Flora appears to be touched by something although it could as easily be a form of autism as the Hand of God. Meanwhile the coldness of Jewish mysticism as espoused by his father isnt enough for Aaron. He needs more. And when a pretty blonde disciple of Krishna shows interest who is he to refuse? The problem is directors McGehee and Siegels incorporation of mysticism into the films fundamental structure is inelegant. I didnt buy it. It seems like a contrivance. And thats a problem because so much of Bee Season is wrapped up in our ability to accept in the context of this story the existence of the supernatural. In what may seem to be a contradiction of terms the characters all have arcs but none of these individuals is well developed. They are advanced in fits and starts with the expansiveness of the book being chopped up into manageable bites. Its like what happens when an analog signal is digitized. What was originally smooth becomes a series of plateaus drops and rises. The emotional growth of these characters is not seamless; its marked by a series of discontinuities. Powerful dramas show us gradual and believable growth in the protagonists. Bee Season cuts corners. (This is frequently the result of attempting to condense a complex character-based novel into a 100-minute motion picture.) Bee Seasons depiction of Floras magical ability to spell almost any word straddles the line between being clever and too cute. At one point sprouting seedlings arrange themselves into characters of the alphabet. On another occasion an origami bird alights by letters in a banner hanging on a wall. Its visually inventive and gets the point across but it also gives the filmmakers an opportunity to show off. Acting is one of the films strong suits. Young Flora Cross who was 11 when the movie was filmed is a natural actress. Theres no artifice in the performance nor is there a sense that shes forcing things. Seemingly without effort she becomes serious studious Eliza. And theres a distinct welcome absence of cuteness. Many child actors try to win us over with winsome smiles and charm; thats not the case here. Meanwhile Max Minghella does the best he can with a choppily written role. (Aaron would have benefited greatly from a handful of additional scenes.) Richard Gere and Juliette Binoche are professionals although Gere fares better here. His is the meatier adult role. Like Minghella Binoche has to be satisfied with doing the best she can with meager material. Whatever else it may be Bee Season is an interesting motion picture. And the protagonists while fitfully developed hold their fascinations. The deeper we look into the character of Saul the clearer the portrait becomes of a self-centered and egotistical human being. To the extent that he is responsible for tearing his family apart and is oblivious to his own faults he resembles Jeff Daniels patriarch in The Squid and the Whale (a more compelling dysfunctional family drama). Theres no shortage of material on the screen in Bee Season - its just not assembled in a satisfying manner.

"A Bee in the Ointment washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies A Bee in the Ointment Saul (Richard Gere) helps his spelling bee-winning daughter Eliza (Flora Cross) learn the secrets of the universe and beyond in ""Bee Season."" (Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday November 18 2005 Gods special connection to the world lies in pieces and its going to take innumerable acts of human goodwill to repair that broken vessel. This is the spiritual metaphor Saul Naumann (Richard Gere) lays out for his 11-year-old daughter Eliza (Flora Cross) in ""Bee Season."" A former underachiever who has suddenly acquired a talent for spelling bees Eliza has become the familys overnight star. Her secret she tells her father is a mystical ability to visualize complicated words. She literally sees the letters float in front of her. Saul a biblical scholar deeply drawn to Kabbalah believes he can train Eliza in the ancient Jewish doctrine thereby opening her up to the mysteries of words the secrets of the universe and ultimately union with God. Those competitions he tells her should be treated as a mere conduit for Elizas greater mission. He pulls out the big books and his own research papers and they get down to work. ""Bee Season"" which also stars Juliette Binoche aims to evoke the power of religion through Elizas psychic journey and the effect she has on her divided family. But the story adapted from Myla Goldbergs novel turns on a disappointingly routine premise The self-absorbed Saul is so busy pushing his daughter into the higher realm he doesnt realize his own family is falling apart. Instead of trying to save the world -- is everyone writing this down? -- he could start by getting his own house in order. Sauls wife Miriam (Binoche) for instance is another broken vessel. We know this because of recurrent flashback images of shattered glass and a car accident. Lately shes been sneaking out of her job as a lab scientist to steal glass trinkets and crystals from strangers homes. Saul and Miriams son Aaron (Max Minghella) a talented musician is also leading a secret life. He has been skipping out to the local Hare Krishna temple to find God in his own way with help from his newfound girlfriend Chali (Kate Bosworth). Whats going on with Miriam? Will Saul learn to listen to Aaron instead of yelling at him? Is Eliza going to find God save the world and bring her family together? Unfortunately these questions fail to compel us because Naomi Foners screenplay fails to address its topics more than superficially. Minghella (director Anthony Minghellas son) has a spirited turn as Aaron and first-time performer Cross exudes Elizas ineffable qualities. But the adults are surprisingly ineffective. Geres fussy over-earnest performance makes it hard to connect emotionally with him. Hes Yoda as an overachieving yuppie. (""The path is dangerous"" he tells Eliza.) Binoche may be a naturally alluring presence but she doesnt fit in this family or this movie. Its as if she wandered off the set of a nearby French-language production. Co-directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel whose visual schemes lent a hypnotic aura to their previous collaborations -- ""Deep End"" and ""Suture"" -- dont find the right balance of story and image this time. They seem more interested in the special effects razzle-dazzle -- creating a gorgeous cascade of flowering seeds for instance when Eliza visualizes ""dandelion"" -- than the movies serious underpinnings. Saul himself would have cautioned them not to focus so literally on the words and think instead about the movies deeper meaning. Bee Season (104 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for intense themes a scene of sensuality and profanity.

Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Bee Season"" with Richard Gere Juliette Binoche Flora Cross Max Minghella Kate Bosworth. Directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel from a screenplay by Naomi Foner Gyllenhaal based on the novel by Myla Goldberg. 104 minutes. Rated PG-13 for thematic elements a scene of sensuality and brief strong language. Several theaters. Perhaps Im better off having not read Myla Goldbergs best-selling novel ""Bee Season"" because I didnt approach the movie version with distracting thoughts about which parts of the novel are missing or weakly adapted. All I know is ""Bee Season"" got better the more I thought about it. For one thing its more thoughtfully conceived than most of what passes for filmmaking these days. As they proved in their superb mystery-thriller ""The Deep End"" co-directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel know how to precisely parse information through visual detail and careful attention to human behavior. They may not be ""Hitchcockian"" in the purest sense but they share Hitchcocks skill in strategically controlling what they want us to see and hear. That alone makes ""Bee Season"" a stimulating experience as visual details inform the story as it unfolds. We quickly learn volumes about the spiritual and emotional dysfunction of the Naumanns an academically inclined family in Berkeley ensconced in one of those comfy homes full of books brains and broken relationships. Saul (Richard Gere) is a professor of Jewish theology intellectually driven and emotionally distant; his wife Miriam (Juliette Binoche) still traumatized by a past tragedy lives behind a veil of secret coping mechanisms. Teenage son Aaron (Max Minghella son of film director Anthony Minghella) is primed for rebellion easily lured by a free-spirited Hare Krishna (Kate Bosworth) to defy his fathers rule. Eleven-year-old daughter Eliza (Flora Cross) goes virtually unnoticed until she wins a regional spelling bee prompting Saul to invest his selfish pride in her success. What he cant know in his academic grasp of Kabbalah theory is that Eliza is a genuine Kabbalah mystic engaged by words and their correct spellings on the deepest spiritual level. For her spelling is a subconsciously spiritual way of solving a complex familial puzzle. (For the filmmakers its a way to indulge some precious computer-generated wizardry.) How this is dramatized by screenwriter Naomi Foner Gyllenhaal (mother of actors Jake and Maggie) -- and how ""Bee Season"" hinges on the exceptional performance of 12-year-old Cross -- is both vexing (because much of the film is so self-consciously clever) and ultimately rewarding. Like Geres character the film is vaguely distant for longer than it needs to be but the end justifies the means when mysteries are solved and motivations fully understood. Only then is the strength of ""Bee Season"" fully revealed when Eliza makes a decision thats wise beyond her years. Its one of the finer movie moments of 2005.

To its credit ""Bee Season"" also intelligently tests many other hypotheses such as a lack of public interest in seeing religion discussed onscreen a general distrust of magical realism or that movie families must radiate joy instead of relentless melancholy. But the keys to the three interlocking stories of Myla Goldbergs adapted novel rest with Richard Gere as an aggressively thoughtful patriarch. He tries his hardest to improve his family and thereby drives them all crazy one by one. Gere is a little too smooth a little too pretty to play an intense and accomplished scholar of Jewish mysticism. Still Gere plausibly sells Goldbergs conceit that an apparently warm home can double as a mere holding pen for four individuals spinning in completely separate universes. Gere his wife and two children are magnets turned to the wrong end trying so hard to come together that unseen forces push everything away. If ""Bee Season"" had a subtitle it would be ""I Dont Even KNOW You Anymore."" The Naumann family seems to be buzzing right along a hive of intellectual energy. Gere ponders the mysteries of the Kabbalah. Juliette Binoche his sad but lovely wife schedules the kids and tries to live up to Dads high standards of scholarship and home economics. Teenage Aaron (Max Minghella) is a musical genius and a friendly competitor to his father. Only 11-year-old Eliza (remarkable newcomer Flora Cross) has nothing to offer Dads attention and she suddenly discovers a talent for spelling at her school championship. Geres father figure preaches kindness but practices competition. He throws over his sons interests and his unhappy wife to study spelling with Eliza. ""Isnt God in the words?"" he demands of his family. Memorizing the letters of a word or the notes of a sonata are not enough - the student must delve into context and break beyond that into the spirituality of true knowledge. At one memorable movie moment a live bird turns itself into folded paper to help an entranced Eliza spell ""origami."" With the eyes of Dad turned elsewhere Mom and Aaron sneak away. Aaron tries out new churches skulking guiltily into a Catholic Mass and a Krishna temple. Mom seeks the comfort of materialism breaking into empty houses to steal trinkets that she saves for some desperate unknown purpose. If ""Bee Season"" can be faulted for failing to resolve its stories or completely connecting us to this edgy family it must also be praised for effort. Reflecting Goldbergs virtuoso novel the film sets up rich dichotomies of what people say and do and of satisfying the self vs. pleasing the community. Gere speaks poetically of mending the universe through deed yet hes bewildered when his family tries to act on internal voices reading them a different poem. He tells his wife yes people can make transcendent bonds but the disbelief in Binoches eyes shows he has not yet made a meaningful bond with her. Defending her father Eliza tells her brother ""Dad wants to get closer to God."" Aarons pitch-perfect exasperated response is ""Yeah. Well."" Two short words not hard to spell. But ""Bee Season"" crafts those and thousands more carefully selected words into a magically sad story.

"Bee Season lacks definition - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Bee Season lacks definition By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  November 18 2005 An 11-year-old girl stands on a stage spelling words. Placebo. Flux. Fluorescent. Possibility. With each word she slips into a trance an unnoticed ecstasy that approaches religious proportions. Is this the way she wonders on the soundtrack to reach the ear of God?Clearly this isnt Spellbound"" or that Broadway spelling-bee musical. Rather its the big-screen adaptation of Bee Season"" Myla Goldbergs 2000 best-selling novel about Eliza Naumann (Flora Cross) who spells her way to the national championships as her family falls to pieces. Religious transcendence is very much on the movies mind at times to the exclusion of sense.But you too might have to take on faith a film that posits Richard Gere as Elizas father Saul Naumann Berkeley religion professor kabbalist adept sexy kitchen wizard and smothering patriarchal presence. Over the years this actor has become a beguiling silver fox trickier than he seems but he still doesnt have the psychic weight to pull off a role like Saul -- the kind of intellectual glory hog who gets his energy by sucking it out of those around him. Gere will never have boots that heavy. Hes just too nice.That central miscasting throws off the films inner gyroscope. Saul is married to Miriam (Juliette Binoche) a scientist whos in the midst of a cryptic emotional crisis. Perhaps she has a lover or perhaps shes mentally ill -- Bee Season"" plays it extremely coy which is at first intriguing and then a little frustrating.The Naumanns teenage son Aaron (Max Minghella son of director Anthony Minghella) is a brooder too and he quietly rebels when Saul transfers his attentions to Eliza once the daughters star potential is revealed. We see this nice Jewish boy entering a Catholic church shopping for religions and then a smiling blond shiksa named Chali approaches him in the park. She wears the saffron robes of a Hare Krishna and is played by Kate Bosworth; for Aaron the combination is like a shot of heroin to the brain. And itll enrage his father. Aaron is hooked.But so is Saul on the idea that his daughter may have a direct line to the core of the Kabbalah the ancient Jewish mystical movement. Eliza goes somewhere far away when she spells and co-directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel (their last film was the remarkable matriarchal melodrama The Deep End"") visualize her fugue states with digitally animated letters that whimsically coalesce and disperse around her head. Its a lovely cinematic conceit at first and the grave attentive Cross wears it well. As Saul excitedly coaches her in the meditative practices of an 18th century Kabbalist rabbi the film outlines the gulf between pedagogy and mystery between good spelling and bad parenting.Fascinating stuff for a mainstream movie with big-name stars so why does Bee Season"" feel so unfocused? The film climaxes with Sauls discovery of both his sons and his wifes guilty secrets -- the latter when we learn it is as baffling to us as it is to him -- but you never get the sense that the characters chickens have come home to roost. In Geres portrayal Saul isnt a bullying intellectual like Jeff Daniels in The Squid and the Whale."" Hes a softer more understandable brand of West Coast solipsist. Binoches Miriam is right to be in tears of constant dismay -- theres no way she can compete with Saul either for her childrens affections or ours.Bee Season"" has moments of ineffable grace -- Im thinking of an origami dove that occasionally flits through the film -- and it has an almost fractal sense of the big picture thats welcome. One needs a solid foundation on which to build faith though whether in people or belief systems or movies. Here the foundation has been miscast. Thats M-I-S-C-A-S-T.

(AP Photo/Fox Searchlight) In this photo provided by Fox Searchlight Saul (Richard Gere) helps his daughter Eliza (Flora Cross) study for a spelling bee in ""Bee Season."" (AP Photo/Fox Searchlight) Photo Fox Searchlight Deeper meaning of words buzzes in Berkeley family 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Bee Season Drama. Starring Richard Gere Juliette Binoche Flora Cross and Max Minghella. Directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel. (PG-13. 104 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) A few minutes into ""Bee Season"" a helicopter flies into view dangling a large capital A at the end of a cable. The aircraft veers toward the East Bay and drops its cargo between L and N on a giant Port of Oakland sign previously missing a vowel. The attempt to be clever is transparent -- spotlight an A to introduce a film about a family obsessed with letters. Conjuring up the correct ones in their proper order is the path to glory for Eliza (Flora Cross) a Bay Area sixth-grader competing in spelling bees. As if thats not pressure enough her father a religion professor with the biblical name Saul (Richard Gere) tells her that words and letters hold all the secrets of the universe and that through them she can get Gods ear. While directed with intelligence and visual flair by Scott McGehee and David Siegel ""Bee Season"" ultimately is undone by the same trait that makes young spelling whizzes insufferable. The movie continually needs to impress with how smart it is like the dizzying crash course in Jewish mysticism Saul gives his daughter miraculously finding in the kaballah tips on how to spell anachronistic words. Saul who had favored his son (Max Minghella) turns all his attention on Eliza recognizing a budding national champ. Closing her eyes shes able to visualize a word; asked to spell ""cotyledon"" embryonic leaves float around her. The film is quite good at showing how the family dynamics change once Dad becomes Elizas coach instead of playing duets with his son on cello. Gere who keeps getting better the further he moves from his romantic hunk roles dominates the movie just as Saul dominates their brown-shingle in Berkeley commandeering the kitchen and backyard barbecues with the aplomb of Martha Stewart. Geres hands are always in motion -- dipping into a dish on the burner hugging the kids pointing out salient words in a text. Its a powerful busy performance and whats amazing is that Cross in her first major feature comes close to matching it. Shes hypnotic showing Eliza in her trancelike states. Mom (Juliette Binoche) an ethereal presence for reasons that become clear later appears at her daughters bedside with a kaleidoscope she had looked through as a child allowing the camera to show fractured images that are rather obviously meant to symbolize the fracturing of their family. ""Bee Season"" buzzes around so many heavy-duty matters -- a dysfunctional parent a personality disorder the history and meaning of religion even religious cults -- you wind up wishing it would lighten up and stick to spelling. Maybe it could take a cue from ""The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee"" and put some of those big words to music. McGehee and Siegel used to live in the Bay Area and they capture a residential side of it rarely seen on screen. The two have proved their talent and craftsmanship in ""The Deep End"" and ""Suture."" As an in-joke the latter is one of the words a youngster is given to spell. But the filmmakers have trouble finding a way into Myla Goldbergs extremely dense novel. ""Bee Season"" is difficult to absorb without the luxury of rereading complex passages and ends up more mystifying than illuminating. The final scenes are especially perplexing. Still theres something to be said for a film with too many ideas rather than too few.

Words and meanings Richard Gere Flora Cross Max Minghella and Juliette Binoche are the complex members of the Naumann family. 20th Century Fox Based on the captivating novel by Myla Goldberg Bee Season is evocative and superbly acted. It doesnt quite manage the shattering emotionality of the novel but its an intriguing if slightly plodding adaptation. Directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel the talented directors of the masterful 2001 thriller The Deep End Bee Season probes similar territory a seemingly picture-perfect family fraying at the seams. At first glance they seem like a close-knit family but the Naumanns live complex separate lives in a dark home that holds many secrets. A kaleidoscope that Eliza 11 received from her mother symbolizes how the familys shared experience has been shattered. About the movie Bee Season    (out of four) Stars Richard Gere Juliette Binoche Max Minghella Flora Cross Director Scott McGehee and David Siegel Distributor Fox Searchlight Pictures Rating PG-13 for thematic elements a scene of sensuality and brief strong language Running time 1 hour 40 minutes Opens Friday in select cities And it is up to Eliza to re-connect her fractured family. Flora Cross plays the gifted Eliza Naumann in a minimalist wide-eyed fashion conveying a potent blend of innocence and knowing. When her spelling prowess is revealed she becomes the pet proj-ect of her father Saul a religious studies professor. Richard Gere plays Saul with finesse embodying the novels self-absorbed but charismatic character. Hes a man who insists on fixing nightly family dinners but keeps his home office off-limits to all but the familys ""star"" which has shifted from his older son Aaron a cellist to Eliza. Saul sees something almost mystical in the way Eliza approaches spelling and begins to teach her about the Kabbalah the study of Jewish mysticism. Meanwhile Aaron (Max Minghella) becomes unmoored when his fathers attentions shift and embarks on his own spiritual quest. Also in search of meaning is their mother Miriam (Juliette Binoche) the films most mysterious and troubled character. The adaptation is an admirable effort particularly because the book is so cerebral and layered. But some random changes from the novel are baffling In the book Saul was a temple cantor but in the film hes a scholar which makes it harder to understand why Saul and Eliza are so intent upon her religious transcendence. The movie is about transcendence whether through the power of words or spirituality. Eliza dismantles and rebuilds words when she spells using a kind of mental kaleidoscope that is portrayed visually as a kind of magical realism. But the words needed for family members to communicate dont materialize as easily. Bee Season is a thought-provoking exploration of the search for meaning and spiritual fulfillment. Thats rarely the stuff of mainstream movies so this serious-minded film is a welcome effort.

Save for later Saved In Bee Season Richard Gere plays a religious man who loves his family but is blinded by his messianism. By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor November 10 2005 Save for later Saved Eliza Naumann (Flora Cross) is an 11-year-old spelling prodigy in ""Bee Season"" a film based on Myla Goldbergs bestseller. For Eliza the letters that make up words are tactile things - talismans. Her father Saul Naumann (Richard Gere) a religious-studies professor at Berkeley believes she communicates with God according to the precepts of Kabbalah which hold that the alphabet contains the secrets of the universe.As Eliza advances to the National Spelling Bee championship her family life unravels Her scientist mother Miriam (Juliette Binoche) becomes unhinged; her teenage brother Aaron (Max Minghella) once their fathers favorite rebels from Judaism by covertly joining the Hare Krishnas. Pound for pound the Naumanns are just about as miserable and dysfunctional as the Tyrones in Eugene ONeills ""Long Days Journey into Night"" though not nearly as entertaining.Saul is such a control freak that he has lost all sight of what he is controlling. He doesnt even register Aarons rage or that Eliza for all her precociousness is practically catatonic. Saul is blinded by his messianism. It is only when he is forced by the police to confront his wifes mental illness or when he discovers his sons secret life that he awakens to the sad carnival that surrounds him. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? In ""Bee Season"" directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel from a script by Naomi Foner Gyllenhaal the idyllic Northern California locale is an ironic backdrop for the mayhem. So is the picture-perfect aura that the Naumanns radiate. At its best in Aarons scenes with a pretty blond Hare Krishna recruiter (the talented Kate Bosworth) or in the moments when he strikes out at his father ""Bee Season"" gets at the ways in which children can be irrevocably wounded by neglect. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 I wish the casting overall had been sharper though. Minghella is wonderful; he has the ability to look ravaged and beseeching at the same time. But Gere is not believable as a Kabbalist professor. Saul is fully stocked with inner demons but as is often the case with Gere he seems to draw all his energies from the surface.Binoches swanky swoon is so ethereal that she practically wafts off the screen. And Cross who has never acted professionally in a movie before lacks expressiveness.I could also have done with a lot less visual mumbo-jumbo typified by the floating fuzz we see when Eliza spells dandelion. These flaws are not fatal because ""Bee Season"" at its core is about something powerful The ways in which family members wreak destruction on each other with the best of intentions. Grade B Rated PG-13 for thematic elements a scene of sensuality and brief strong language.

The answer is much like the betrayed husband from Unfaithful -- great hair great wire-rim eyeglasses. Only instead of living the life of a WASP businessman named Ed Geres character is called Saul. And he lectures on matters of Jewish arcana to rapt students moved by his attractive silveriness as well as by his passion for Kabbalistic mysticism thats at once more rigorously erudite than Madonnas Red String brand and equally conveniently spiritual rather than religious. Then Saul comes home to a house very much like Eds Westchester digs filled with comfortable furniture and comfortably secular family problems familiar to all who live in a therapized world While quiet daughter Eliza (newcomer Flora Cross) emerges to the surprise and obsession of her father as a whiz at spelling bees with an almost mystical ability to ""inhabit"" the letters she enunciates older brother Aaron (Max Minghella son of director Anthony Minghella) who previously held the position of favored smart child feels neglected and is drawn to a proselytizing cult. Meanwhile Sauls wife Miriam (French actress Juliette Binoche to whom Paris-born Cross bears an uncanny physical resemblance) becomes more and more psychologically unstable in ways that leave Saul dumb as a husband however brilliant he is as an academic. And while Saul teaches the Kabbalistic concept of repairing a shattered world Eliza becomes the conduit for fixing a broken family. Directed by The Deep Ends Scott McGehee and David Siegel from a script by Running on Empty screenwriter Naomi Foner Gyllenhaal (mother of those Gyllenhaals) Bee Season shows a fondness for photographing things that shimmer -- letters in the air crystals. The movie works earnestly to transform unfamiliar concepts of philosophy as well as by now exceedingly familiar concepts of endearing/sadistic spelling-bee hysteria into cinematically new representations of letters made flesh. But that same ecumenical earnestness with its mild message of nonsectarian interpersonal healing contradicts the restlessness incandescence and specificity so intrinsic to the story of a girl who feels one with the word.

This intelligent precision-tooled adaptation of Myla Goldbergs 2000 bestseller centered on an 11-year-old spelling whiz delves gingerly into mystical territory in charting the separate paths explored by the quartet of characters. The story of a brainy familys coming apart lacks a crucial emotional component in ""Bee Season."" This intelligent precision-tooled adaptation of Myla Goldbergs 2000 bestseller centered on an 11-year-old spelling whiz delves gingerly into mystical territory in charting the separate paths explored by the quartet of characters. But the film is ice cold never finding a way to invite the viewer into the story and Richard Gere doesnt convince as a Jewish biblical scholar. Upscale literary-oriented types will be lured but fans of the docu ""Spellbound"" expecting similar pleasures along with general auds will find the Fox Searchlight offering far too highfalutin for words. Although the tale pivots on the remarkable progress made by the otherwise ordinary Eliza Naumann (Flora Cross) in spelling bees from the local level to the national finals the larger concern of Naomi Foner Gyllenhaals carefully structured screenplay is the fragmentation of what on the surface appears to be an accomplished admirable family. Saul Naumann (Gere) is a religious studies prof at Berkeley (changed from a folk-singing cantor in the book) particularly taken with the mysticism of the Kabbalah. When Eliza first exhibits her special talent Saul takes her under his wing impressing her with the ancient belief that all the secrets of the universe are contained in letters and deconstructing the alphabet in a way that actually does increase her capacity for spelling. Saul would seem an ideal head of household at least in Northern California terms; he imparts knowledge is home a lot and cooks dinner regularly plays violin-and-cello duets with his gifted son Aaron (Max Minghella) and is supportive of his wife Miriam (Juliette Binoche). But he conspicuously wears his teachers hat at home and when he pours all his energy into helping Eliza Aaron and Miriam go their own ways in secretive and dramatic fashions. From the beginning pic gives the impression of a velvet-lined machine producing plush images of a perfectionist lifestyle thats rich both in substance (the familys resplendent craftsman-style house) and in mind. After a giant silver letter ""A"" is transported by helicopter across San Francisco Bay letters keep popping up in mysterious circumstances and configurations which increasingly comes to relate to the new process by which Eliza is able to ""see"" the proper spelling of even the most obscure words. Dramatically however focus gradually shifts away from Eliza in favor of her brother and mother. In an act of rebellion that seems both overplayed and under motivated (not to mention anachronistic) Aaron pursues an interest in Hinduism by taking up with a local Hare Krishna group. Granted his blossoming interest may be mostly spurred by the blond beauty who turns him on to it (Kate Bosworth as a character not in the book) but when was the last time anyone saw Hare Krishnas around town even in Berkeley? More frustrating still is the subplot played out by Miriam who takes to disappearing in the evening and casing upscale houses for unknown reasons. Flash cuts suggest that the French native is still haunted by visions of her parents death which ties in with a Kabbalistic theme favored by Saul about how things that are shattered can be made whole again a metaphor furthered by the eventual revelation of Miriams clandestine activities. (Manner of the visions presentation along with Binoches presence conjures the presumed influence of Krzysztof Kieslowski here.) Co-directors Scott McGehee and David Siegels first two features the ultra-indie ""Suture"" and the more mainstream ""The Deep End"" were provocative carefully calibrated intellectual works in which an absence of feeling was a minor problem at most. In ""Bee Season"" however an emotional component was crucially needed to involve the audience with these rarefied people doing relatively rarefied things. As it stands one remains at a distant remove throughout respectful of the tricky material under consideration and the difficulty of giving it flesh-and-blood onscreen but detached to the point of indifference to its outcome. Young thesps Minghella and Cross are good enough as the kids but the adults have problems. The behavior of Binoches character is so inscrutable as the film plays out that one more or less dismisses her as no insight is allowed into her increasingly recessive self. More crucially Gere provides the Talmudic scholar with an exuberant self-satisfied confidence but no sense of depth or reflection; its all surface and no inner life which doesnt satisfactorily serve the needs of the story. Fancy special effects illustrate the visions Eliza has when she closes her eyes to come up with proper spellings. Giles Nuttgens lensing is ultra-luxuriant a lead followed in all other tech departments. For the record the novel was set in the Philadelphia area.
