"Thunderballs Slate Sign In Sign Up Thunderballs Thunderballs Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 11 1999 330 AM Thunderballs Austin Powers trips back to the 60s. By David Edelstein Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me Directed by Jay Roach New Line CinemaLimboDirected by John Sayles Sony/Screen Gems Early in Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me the stumpy snaggletoothed British secret agent (Mike Myers) survives an assassination attempt by his new bride Vanessa (Elizabeth Hurley) who turns out to have been a ""fembot"" programmed by his nemesis Dr. Evil (also Myers) to blow up the couples honeymoon suite after 15 rounds of zealous humping. Following a suitable period of mourning for his exploded mate (five seconds) Austin greets his restored bachelorhood with a frenzy of exhibitionism--romping nude through the lobby of his posh hotel pointing out his privates to assorted female passers-by and launching into a lengthy water ballet in the company of Esther Williams-style chorines. Watching this sequence I thought of the late David Niven who during the 1974 Academy Awards ceremony saw a streaker charge across the stage and brought the house down with an ad-lib about the fellow ""showing off his shortcomings."" Niven wouldnt get a laugh here Myers has rendered himself invulnerable to the incinerating one-liners of prudes and sniggerers. Austin might be oblivious to his own ridiculousness but Myers isnt. He has made Austins ""shortcomings"" the mans strongest suit and the act of showing them off both smashingly funny and--yes--attractive. Forget about defeating Dr. Evil Austin Powers represents the exuberant conquest of shame. Advertisement The Spy Who Shagged Me is better than anyone dared hope bigger more inventive and more frolicsome than its predecessor with a grab bag of scatological gags that are almost as riotous when you think back on them. Im laughing now The movie gives infantilism a good name. Let me add that I wasnt a fan of the first installment Austin Powers International Man of Mystery (1997) which tanked after a lively opening. It was rife with overextended jokes--and the strange thing was that the joke wasnt the joke the joke was the overextension of the joke. The terrible flaccid timing was what was supposed to be funny. I wondered What does it say when a gifted performer such as Myers sets out to make a ""bad"" movie the kind of cheeseball 60s Bond imitation that untalented people made by accident? But I underestimated Myers connection to the material. As a youth he evidently fantasized about living in Londons ""swinging"" 60s portrayed in movies as an era when ugly posturing little guys could routinely make it with long-haired short-skirted hippie chicks whod dance ecstatically while the camera zooms in and out. TV shows like Laugh-In and movies like Casino Royale (1967) and In Like Flint (1967) must have got all mashed together in his wet dreams. His resulting alter ego Austin Powers is Man before the Fall--provided you see the Fall as the mid-70s when embarrassment returned to the culture with a vengeance. It helps that in The Spy Who Shagged Me Dr. Evil has soared in stature becoming nearly as heroic a throwback as Austin himself--the supervillain seeming far more vulnerable to the slings and arrows of ridicule than the superhero. The bald curdle-faced pinky-sucker is still locked in excruciating combat with his teen-aged son Scott Evil (Seth Green) who never misses a chance to jeer at his fathers grandiosity and who in turn is dismissed as ""quasievil ... semievil."" A partially successful cloning attempt by Dr. Evils henchman Number 2 (Robert Wagner) has produced a true heir a one-eighth Dr. Evil replica (Verne J. Troyer) dubbed ""Mini-Me"" whos like a distillation of the archvillains most feral impulses. This snarling munchkin gives the Dr. Evil scenes--which still run long--a blast of energy. Dr. Evils subtext of sexual jealousy has become his motive. Covetous of Austin Powers lack of inhibition he contrives to go back in time--to 1969 when both he and Powers were cryogenically frozen--and steal the source of the secret agents appeal his life force or ""mojo."" Mojo-less Austin panics when the opportunity comes to shag CIA agent Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham); mojo-laden Dr. Evil leaps into bed with his heretofore lesbian henchwoman Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling) but post-coitus cannot maintain a guiltless hedonism ""It got weird didnt it?"" he murmurs. The director Jay Roach keeps the picture bumping along refusing to give the gags more weight than they warrant. Actually he rarely gives them any weight The bad jokes dont fall flat so much as blow away like onion skins. The commercial tie-ins--for Starbucks Virgin Atlantic Airlines and Heineken--arent as oppressive as one might fear although Austins AOL e-mail address is a cybernetic badge of uncool. You go to a movie like this for the cameos and in-jokes for Tim Robbins popping up as a harried U.S. president or Burt Bacharach and Elvis Costello emerging to croon (beautifully) ""What Do You Get When You Fall in Love?"" In the credits Rob Lowes name is superimposed over Myers bare butt. Willie Nelson and Woody Harrelson appear largely because their first names are euphemisms for ""penis."" Now theres a riff on You Only Live Twice (1967) now a hyperbolic parody of Thunderball (1965) now a piece of lame slapstick involving an electrical swivel chair. Dr. Evil dispatches a new henchman a 400-plus pound kilt-wearing Scotsman named Fat Bastard (also Myers) to poke a long needle into the frozen Austins crotch. Later Austin mistakenly pours himself a cup of ""coffee"" from a jar containing a Fat Bastard stool sample. There are also more sophisticated interlocking parodies as when grim-faced NORAD radar operators tune in Jerry Springer and find Seth and Dr. Evil in the middle of a show called ""My Father Is Evil and Wants To Take Over the World""--a segment that degenerates into bleeping and fisticuffs when the archvillain rushes an indignant Klansman. Advertisement No doubt Heather Graham is one of prettiest women on Earth. Her face has the freshness of a junior-high-school yearbook photo--it might be the apotheosis of the junior-high-school yearbook photo--and theres more than a touch of Barbie in her long thighs and high bottom. She knows how to move and shes sweet and shes game. But lets face it shes a twittering blank--a bore. I miss the witty poise that Elizabeth Hurley brought to the first Austin Powers. More than that I wish that Myers had it in him to cultivate his counterpart as a comic actress and then let her rip--an actress who could be nerdy and alluring at once whod have a comeback for ""I put the grrrrr in swinger baby."" I nominate Lisa Kudrow but there are probably others. You just have to be brave enough to look. For all Myers fearlessness he has yet to prove his manhood by letting an equal into his bed. Limbo the latest effort from John Sayles strains to be a great movie to the point where it breaks into two different movies--neither fully successful but both with huge compensations. The first is a grimly sardonic portrait of Alaska as a kind of Third World melting pot--full of desperate poverty and crime and on the verge of a transition to a tourist-based economy in which the interior will be cleared of timber but an illusion of wildness maintained. Alaska were promised will turn into a giant neo-Disney theme park. The other story is the love affair between a luckless torch singer (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) and a luckless ex-fisherman (David Strathairn) in which the two--through a series of melodramatic contrivances that testify to Sayles lack of ingenuity as a storyteller--end up together with the singers brilliant desperately unhappy daughter (Vanessa Martinez) on a remote island where theyre prey to cold starvation and drug smugglers with shotguns. Plotting was never Sayles forte. What he did have from the start was an actors insight into how people dramatize themselves and a novelists insight into how they actually appear. He can write sharp funny spiels and interlocking monologues in which people misrepresent themselves but somehow--miraculously--communicate their essence. At some point though he decided to become a saint of leftist independent filmmaking to turn away from his real gifts suppress his craftiness and make movies about ordinary people crushed by an economic system that sets brother against brother (or sister). He cultivated a wanness in himself; he labored to locate the Canadian within. At its worst Limbo is about when bad things happen to good people and its ending is cruelly abrupt (although maybe merciful if it means what I think it does). But its best is really good. Im not sure I totally buy Strathairn as a diffident loner with an aching conscience over a tragedy that wasnt his fault--the quintessential guiltless sinner. But Sayles has written some gorgeously tender and funny encounters between him and Mastrantonio. And she is simply extraordinary. Always a superb actress who never quite had the stature for a leap to stardom Mastrantonio--like Diane Lane in A Walk on the Moon--has developed layers and an edge. Her Donna De Angelo (I hate that tart/angel name) is both desperate to grab onto a man and smart enough to watch in horror as shes grabbing. She has a torch singers simultaneous immersion and distance--a talent for watching herself fall and for commenting on it exquisitely. This is a major performance one of the comebacks of the decade.

Starring Mike Myers Heather Graham Michael York Robert Wagner Rob Lowe Kristen Johnston and Elizabeth Hurley. Directed by Jay Roach. Written by Mike Myers and Michael McCullers. (PG-13. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Mike Myers has created a gold mine with the ""Austin Powers"" series. A brilliantly silly satire of 60s spy movies starring Myers as the buck-toothed randy title character ""Austin Powers"" was delicious fun in the first go-round in 1997 -- and is even more so today. Co-written by Myers and Michael McCullers ""Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me"" opening today has all the goofiness of the first film. Its also got more punch more lavish production (dig the Day-Glo and velvet hot pants baby) a raft of celebrity cameos (its Robert Wagner Oh behave) and a new level of raunchiness that has obviously trickled down from the success of ""Theres Something About Mary."" Breast jokes crotch jokes double entendres -- nothing new there. But its all bigger and bolder including a scene in which Austin mistakes a stool sample for a cup of coffee. Probably the coolest thing about watching this movie is seeing how much Myers who first came our way as a cast member of ""Saturday Night Live"" has developed as a screen comedian. He was never bad Even in something as mediocre as ""So I Married an Axe Murderer"" Myers had a zest an infectious spirit and a deft talent for voices and physical business. In ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" directed by Jay Roach Myers is freer more inspired and confident. In the same way that Jim Carreys breakout success in ""Ace Ventura Pet Detective"" and ""The Mask"" established him as Robin Williams chief rival ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" places Myers firmly on the top rung of movie comics. (Actually with Williams stuck in the goo of such films as ""Patch Adams"" and ""What Dreams May Come"" Myers Carrey and Adam Sandler have the field to themselves.) Like Carrey Myers draws us into his sublime mischief and makes us his accomplices. We can feel his joy in performing his eagerness to include us in the joke. His playfulness is exhilarating -- it gives us permission to relax laugh louder enjoy our own latent silliness. ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" picks up when the honeymooning Powers discovers that his bride Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley) is not the woman he thought she was. Single again he romps about naked during the opening-credits sequence his privates precariously covered by shifting names and titles. Austins nemesis the bald megalomaniac Dr. Evil also played by Myers is back making trouble by traveling back to 1969 and stealing Powers ""mojo"" i.e. his family jewels. Grinning toothily and spouting 60s lingo (""Youre a groovy baby baby"") Austin travels back too in a Volkswagen Beetle. He meets the scrumptious CIA agent Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham born to wear hot pants) and gives us 95 minutes of politically incorrect defiantly silly humor. In addition to Austin and Dr. Evil Myers plays a third character an enormously fat horny and flatulent Scot named Fat Bastard. Hes disgusting hes huge hes guaranteed to offend overweight people -- and Myers pulls it off. ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" also has 2-foot-8-inch actor Verne Troyer playing Mini-Me Dr. Evils miniature clone; sexy chicks in belted minis and go-go boots; references to ""Star Wars"" ""Dr. No"" and ""Faster Pussycat Kill Kill""; a walk on the moon; a Robert Wagner takeoff by Rob Lowe; Dr. Evil slipping into sassy finger-snapping black-girl lingo; and cameos by Willie Nelson Woody Harrelson Burt Bacharach and Elvis Costello.

Expanded in every aspect save inspiration co-writer/star Mike Myers vehicle tickles the funny bone ably enough for 95 minutes yet feels like a quickie where it ultimately counts most -- in the writing. Repeat biz is thus likely to disappoint. Still massive marketing oomph and a summertime field largely clear of comedies cutting across so many demographic groups should make this a strong B.O. performer in nearly all arenas. As with the first installment which reaped 56 million theatrically pic can look forward to a huge video audience. Pic starts with a cosmic scroll -- the first of many timely ""Star Wars"" nods -- recalling first episodes events then picks up exactly where ""International Man of Mystery"" left off with psychedelic superagent Austin (Myers) and lovely cohort Vanessa (Elizabeth Hurley) in their honeymoon suite. The spouse however is ""exposed"" and disposed of in rather rote hasty fashion leaving our playboy protag to swing freely once again. Brit intelligence boss Basil Exposition (Michael York) calls in news that natch the world is again imperiled by arch-nemesis Dr. Evil (Myers) whose outer-space exile hasnt lasted long. Rejoining subordinates Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling) Number Two (Robert Wagner) and whiny teenage son Scott (Seth Green) the doc now plans to plant a giant laser gun on the moon picking off urban centers until his ransom demand is met. Yea worse hes rigged a flunkys time-machine travel to 1969 hypodermically stealing the ""mojo"" (viscous guck equated with Samsons hair) from our then-cryogenically frozen superhero. Soon Austin himself is tripping back to the Paisley Age where curvaceous fellow agent Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham) is his new ally in preventing Evil domination. They eventually journey to the chrome-plated fiends secret island headquarters. Expected gunplay explosions and against-the-ticking-clock silliness ensue. Among the better new wrinkles are crybaby Scotts reunion with nefarious Dad on ""The Jerry Springer Show"" (topic ""My Father Is Evil And Wants to Take Over the World"") and a steamy chess game with bodacious enemy spy Ivana Humpalot (Kristen Johnston). Sterlings role as the Lotte Lenya-style frau is given welcome extra screen time; its also a hoot seeing Rob Lowes spot-on Wagner impression as a younger Number Two. But sequels major added characters -- Dr. Es mute diminutive clone Mini-Me (Verne J. Troyer) and repulsive Scottish hit man Fat Bastard (Myers) who provokes far too much scatological humor -- are just middling conceits. More surprisingly the near-infinite possibilities presented by revisiting Swinging London are tapped no further than a brief ""Laugh-In"" take-off and another seg in which Austin and Felicity shop for groovy Carnaby Street threads. Biggest letdown however is that Myers and Michael McCullers script just doesnt have it in terms of fresh narrative developments or individual gags. Too many of the latter are simply insistent reprises from part one; dialogue often sounds the result of so-so improv that should have been improved upon. Movie in-jokes jokey product placements and a misguided dependence on soon-to-be-dated pop culture references (Dr. Evil now uses 90s hip-hop slang) fill out the rest of a colorful fast-paced but thin diversion. With no truly outstanding comic set pieces returning helmer Jay Roachs feature percolates along amusingly enough but leaves a throwaway aftertaste. (A packed young preview aud laughed consistently then barely applauded at the end.) Myers two main onscreen personae -- not including Fat B. who one hopes wont be returning -- delight once again their tics and incidental reactions often registering as funnier than any actual jokes. Graham is a sexy game partner who like Hurley before her doesnt really bring much comic flair of her own to the party. Various fleeting guests turn up as well Will Ferrell Tim Robbins Willie Nelson Woody Harrelson et al plus Burt Bacharach and Elvis Costello in a musical bit. Theyre all clearly having great fun. Too bad the material doesnt push them to the originals level of spotty but oft-inspired lunacy. A considerable budgetary jump allows pics designers to run wild -- Austins 1969 London pad limns the last word in mod excess -- though special effects remain willfully tacky true to overall concepts 1960s spy-fantasy genre roots. Widescreen lensing is Day-Glo bright pace frantic (complete with more of prior episodes go-go ""psychedelic scene breaks"") other tech contribs high-grade.

"Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me (PG-13) Related Items ""Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me"" showtimes Interview with Mike Myers Filmgoer comments from D.C. premiere New Powers Generation By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 11 1999 Austin Powers (Mike Myers) is back to fight Dr. Evil in ""The Spy Who Shagged Me."" (New Line) Director Jay Roach Cast Mike Myers; Heather Graham; Rob Lowe; Robert Wagner; Seth Green; Phil Hawn; Clint Howard; Kristen Johnston; Verne Troyer; Elizabeth Hurley Running Time 1 hour 35 minutes Humor ranging from saucy to extremely gross and sexual situations - of course Mike Myers knows and we know ""Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me"" is just a sequel. But instead of resigning himself to dreary reiteration Myers has freed himself from the unspoken pressure to measure up against ""Austin Powers International Man of Mystery."" Hes gone for broke baby. And I think hes gone one better. The simple reason? Hes given himself license to riff. Not to mention license to promote. If you havent seen Myers on the hustings by now - selling everything from Virgin Atlantic plane tickets to Heineken beer - you do not own a television or a radio and you never leave the house. The plot? Ha Austin Powers has your plot right here baby. The mission? Lets just say Austin has to travel back to 1969 where his own cryogenically frozen body has been deprived of its ""mojo"" by Austin Powerss archenemy Dr. Evil (also played by Myers). In a way ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" has followed the trajectory of the James Bond films it pays tribute to It has advanced to the Roger Moore era in which the story is a mere excuse for fun and games. Theres a rampant looseness to this movie and its subversively liberating. Just watch Dr. Evil appearing on ""The Jerry Springer Show"" re-encountering his estranged son Scott Evil (Seth Green) to hoots aaaaws and jeers from the TV audience. ""Youre the Diet Coke of evil"" complains Dr. Evil to his low-achieving son. Or cringe as Austin mistakes a flask of stool sample for coffee. Or wince as he prances naked through Londons swinging world his privates strategically hidden by credit titles or large slabs of meat. Although much time is spent between Austin and Heather Graham as his new sexy companion CIA operative Felicity Shagwell Myers and co-screenwriter Michael McCullers invest much of the comic oomph in the evil camp. It pays off hilariously. Dr. Evil who has found sponsorship from Starbucks has just cloned himself a replica son about one-eighth the size of Evil. A vicious little scamp known as Mini-Me (played by the 2-foot 8-inch actor Verne Troyer) he has the same facial scar as his genetic pop puts a very little pinkie to the corner of his mouth and loves to flip the bird at Scott his new sibling rival. And then theres Fat Bastard a rotund bilious Scot played by Myers with a 70-inch waistline grotesquely saggy flesh and the nastiest personality in the Northern Hemisphere. If you thought ""Goldfingers"" Oddjob was a heavy youll never be the same after watching this dyspeptic chunker lying in bed after a bout with Felicity his flesh smeared with grease as he chomps on chicken. He also eats cloned children - or tries to. Passionate sparks fly between Dr. Evil and the Rosa Klebb-like Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling) up at the Starbucks HQ and it leads to a hysterical scene on the morning after as these two agents of diabolical evil make clumsy conversation like embarrassed lovebirds. ""I cant let my feelings for you interfere with my plans to take over the world"" says Dr. Evil tenderly. Hey I can afford to fill this review with such giveaways. Theres plenty more where those came from. If you dont care for one gag therell be another one in a minute just like a London double decker. Dont worry about the story baby. Just slide over to Austins pad with all the psychedelic lights the swinging chicks and - in the middle of it all - the shagalicious Austin Powers shaking his bits and pieces and laughing all the way to the Bank of England.

Once again hes trying to shut up his son the witheringly sarcastic oh-so-90s Scott (Seth Green). Looking like a very angry very pale coconut Dr. Evil glares at the young man and in a bebop litany of commands orders him over and over again to ""zip it."" (My favorite riff He spits out Asian-movie gibberish and says ""Subtitle Zip it"") The routine has the biting aggression that contemporary comedy thrives on yet theres another element that fuels Mike Myers performance -- something I can only call joy. Joy is Myers ruling spirit and every so often The Spy Who Shagged Me gooses you with it. Its there in the opening-credits sequence as Austin his favorite organ hidden by an assortment of phallic delicacies prances naked through a hotel to the chirpy cocktail-lounge strains of ""Soul Bossa Nova."" Its there in the way that Dr. Evil melts at the sight of his newly hatched sidekick a mutely stoic midget clone named Mini-Me (played by the 2-foot-8-inch Verne J. Troyer) or in the way that he takes a swig of malt liquor pours some onto the floor a la Tupac and then says ""Thats for my homeys."" There is in fact just enough joy in The Spy Who Shagged Me to make you wish there had been more of it. Myers and his collaborators cowriter Michael McCullers and director Jay Roach dont do anything terribly wrong yet the new movie Im afraid is a mixed bag baby. The first Austin Powers became a new kind of phenomenon a national cult megahit. Months ago as I was wandering through a video store I saw half a dozen people staring up at a TV monitor idiot grins plastered on their faces as they watched Austin vanquish the Fembots with his arse-thrusting nipple-diddling dance to ""I Touch Myself."" I joined the gawkers and was soon beaming idiotically too. It was obvious that wed all seen the movie before (some of us more than once). Yet Myers shameless exuberance was addictive; you had to keep watching him. We live in an age when comedy lusts for the Extreme -- for the banshee ferocity of Jim Carrey or Chris Tucker the reptilian bawdiness of Howard Stern. Ultimately though all of these performers armor themselves with their rock-star cool. The glory of Myers as Austin Powers is that he was willing to be majestically uncool transcendently embarrassing. What in the end could be more extreme than that As a character Austin Powers hasnt worn out his welcome exactly but he has outlived his novelty. Hes so dazed and myopic that Myers doesnt have much choice but to rehash the same bits (""Do I make you hawny?"") and the whole notion of spoofing/saluting paisley fashions free love and James Bond now plays like yesterdays wild card. This time Austin time-travels back to the swinging London of 1969 where he hooks up with the gorgeous miniskirted CIA agent Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham) and tries to get back his mojo -- the precious bodily essence that Dr. Evil has stolen. Myers parading the same jelly belly grotty teeth and dirty carpet of chest hair remains innocent in his very repulsiveness. His Austin is a twinkly-eyed ""swinger"" who with his horn-rims and crushed-velvet Carnaby Street suit is actually the squarest guy around. He thinks the fact that hes got a penis makes him sexy. The Spy Who Shagged Me has a lot of penis jokes -- too many. A few of the low routines are funny like a verbal montage of male-member puns and Austin and Felicity caught in deliriously obscene silhouette. The new character of Fat Bastard a corpulent foul-tempered Scottish grotesque (also played by Myers) just makes disgusting bathroom humor seem...disgusting. Myers real triumph is what he does with Dr. Evil. In the first film the characters fey cultured drone and pinky-nibbling theatrics (which conceal his utter incompetence) just made him seem like Ernst Stavro Blofeld with a frontal lobe missing but in The Spy Who Shagged Me he goes further. He raps he shows up on Jerry Springer he has a skittish interoffice affair with Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling) he speaks in a demented garble of crossed-era pop references. Its a Dr. Evil vaudeville show. As for Heather Graham she certainly looks good enough to shag in her 60s duds but the movie oddly enough never quite finds a place for her lollipop lusciousness. Its as if someone had told her to behave and she listened.

"Austin Powers 2 The Spy Who Shagged Me | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; austin-powers-2-the-spy-who-shagged-me ) Austin Powers 2 The Spy Who Shagged Me (United States 1999) A movie review by James Berardinelli The title characters ""mojo"" isnt the only thing missing from Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me. Also absent are the freshness and spontaneity that characterized the original. Those characteristics have been replaced by lame and obvious attempts at comedy and a lead actress with a particularly poor sense of comic timing. While the movie boasts several sequences of inspired humor too much of what The Spy Who Shagged Me has to offer is tired and derivative and when the various jokes and gags are tallied there are many more misses than hits. Coupled with the dilution of the Bond-related satire that suffused the first entry (this film takes more badly-aimed shots at Star Wars than at 007) it all equates to a disappointing theatrical experience. When the original Austin Powers was released two years ago it became a surprising success story. Not only did the film achieve cult status but it attained a modicum of mainstream acceptance and revived Mike Myers flagging career. And while Austin Powers had its flaws such as a tendency to drag in between comic pinnacles it also possessed a breezy charm that made for a welcome if admittedly sophomoric time at the movies. The Spy Who Shagged Me attempts to recapture its predecessors popularity by mining exactly the same territory. Only this time the jokes arent nearly as funny and the slow parts have become tedious. And while I never expected anything meaningful from The Spy Who Shagged Me I was disappointed by how infrequently the material provoked a genuine from-the-gut laugh. The film opens with a nod to the summers biggest offering by featuring a Star Wars-like crawl that reminds audiences about Austins previous adventure. Soon were joining the International Man of Mystery in a tropical retreat where hes honeymooning with his bride Vanessa (Elizabeth Hurley). However since Hurley wasnt interested in reprising her role for more than a minute or two the character is quickly and effectively dispatched. With his status as a single male restored Austin prepares to play the field but his plans are interrupted by the return of Dr. Evil (Myers). Also back are Evils son Scott (Seth Green); his second-in-command Number Two (Robert Wagner); and another of his criminally-minded lieutenants Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling). New bad guys include a pint-sized clone of Dr. Evil named Mini-Me (Verne J. Troyer) and a one-ton henchman with the appropriate moniker of Fat Bastard (Myers again). Using a time machine Dr. Evil travels back to 1969 where he steals Austin Powers ""mojo."" Powers suddenly sexually dysfunctional in 1999 follows his arch-nemesis back in time. Teamed with American CIA agent Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham) Powers faces an imposing double task retrieve his lost libido and put an end to Dr. Evils latest lunatic plan which involves pointing a moon-based laser at Washington D.C. and demanding 100 billion from the U.S. President (Tim Robbins). Myers tops his dual role from Austin Powers by taking on a third persona this time around Fat Bastard a cantankerous Scotsman who bears a striking physical resemblance to the overweight slob who exploded in the most memorable scene from Monty Pythons The Meaning of Life. Fat Bastards primary purpose is to up the level of scatological comedy. Unfortunately while hes very good at grossing out an audience his comic skills will only work on those who revel in bathroom humor. As far as the other two roles are concerned Myers slips comfortably into the familiar skins of both Dr. Evil and Austin. If theres a third entry into this series undoubtedly the actor will add a fourth character. Unfortunately once you get beyond Myers creative and energetic performances theres not a great deal left in the acting department. Robert Wagner reprises his role as Number Two (with Rob Lowe doubling for him in a younger form during the 1969 sequences) but he has so little screen time that hes barely noticeable. Michael York returns as Basil Exposition as do Mindy Sterling as Frau Farbissina and Seth Green as Dr. Evils pragmatic son. The big casting mistake comes in the form of Heather Graham who has the looks and physical assets to play Austins sidekick/love interest but not the comic aptitude. Unlike Elizabeth Hurley who tore into her role with guts and gusto and relished every ludicrous line Graham is too subdued and there are a few scenes where she appears to be trying to act rather than overact. As poor a choice as Graham is shes doesnt give the worst performance of the movie. Masochists in the audience will appreciate an excruciating cameo by Jerry Springer. For all of its problems The Spy Who Shagged Me has its high points. The banter between Dr. Evil and his son is frequently laced with witticisms (mostly on Scotts part as he indicates obvious flaws in his fathers diabolical convoluted plans). Theres a very funny scene in silhouette that makes it appear that Austin and Felicity are into some extraordinarily kinky sexual activities. (Those who are easily offended beware.) And theres a cleverly edited sequence that has various bit players coming up with different ways to describe a spaceship that resembles male genitalia. This segment challenged the writers to unearth more than a dozen PG-13 rated synonyms for the male reproductive organs. Its juvenile but amusing and features cameos from ""Woody"" Harrelson and ""Willie"" Nelson. By using the same director Jay Roach for both films a certain continuity is assured. Set design for The Spy Who Shagged Me is suitably colorful and outrageous. The films vision of the 1960s bears no resemblance to reality but its pleasing to the eyes. The musical cues plainly designed to sell the soundtrack are mostly nondescript. Overall however theres little in the sequel that stands out and aside from the handful of comic highlights The Spy Who Shagged Me fails to arrest the attention. The original Austin Powers worked because it was new. And while this one is certainly watchable thats far from a ringing endorsement. In the final analysis its basically a drag baby.
