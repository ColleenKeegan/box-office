He certainly uses them with verve -- especially v-words as in his devotion to ""vindicating the vigilant and the virtuous."" Eventually this literary veneer devolves into vexatious volleys of cultural ventriloquism or if you will a vichyssoise of vapid verbiage. But images have power too and several sequences in this film are powerful indeed as in the apocalyptic fulfillment of the Gunpowder Plot Fawkess failed attempt to blow up the Houses of Parliament. ""V for Vendetta"" is a veritable gallery of forceful images and provocative notions recycled from such sources as ""The Phantom of the Opera"" ""The Mark of Zorro"" ""1984"" and ""A Clockwork Orange."" Its also a sententious piece of pop pap that celebrates terrorism as a necessary evil and peddles anarchy in a user-friendly package. ENLARGE The film was written by Andy Wachowski and Larry Wachowski the brothers who created ""The Matrix"" trilogy; they based their screenplay on the comic book series of the same name by Alan Moore and David Lloyd. (The first-time director James McTeigue was assistant director on all three ""Matrix"" productions.) For a while ""V for Vendetta"" draws expertly and extravagantly on the primal power of its pulp antecedent. The fancy language the mysterious protagonist the pervasive sense of evil in an England tyrannized by steely fascists and religious crackpots it all promises to be great fun. And so it is when the epigrammatic swashbuckler V whos played by Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith in ""The Matrix"") crosses paths with Natalie Portmans Evey a frightened little mouse who doesnt know what to make of him -- ""Are you like a crazy person?"" she asks -- or when V like some latter-day Vaughan Williams with a vicious streak conducts his own explosive London symphony from a rooftop. (The film is also being shown in IMAX. I havent seen it in that format but Ill bet it looks impressive.) At its entertaining best ""V for Vendetta"" has the courage of its borrowings and conviction in its posturings. (Whats not entertaining is the smarmy tone of its potshots at an America in the throes we are told of a civil war. ""Here was a country that had everything"" a TV voice intones at one point ""and 20 years later its the worlds biggest leper colony."") Some details of the musty English dystopia may seem familiar to moviegoers old enough to remember Terry Gilliams ""Brazil."" Still the movie is pitched shrewdly to young audiences what with its heroine Evey in constant jeopardy and a hero who turns out to be tortured horribly mutilated -- Darth Vader with a smirky if not quite smiley face -- and conflicted in the bargain since his ostensibly principled terrorism is tainted with a mad lust for revenge. (""Do you really think blowing up Parliament will make this a better place?"" Evey asks him earnestly. The answer is yes he does.) ENLARGE Evey (played by Natalie Portman) is held prisoner in V For Vendetta. Yet the film is beset by incoherence and implausibilities that are perplexing given the close relationship between the Wachowskis and the director Mr. McTeigue -- this is not one of those familiar cases its safe to say where the writers lost control of their material when it went into production. Eveys background clearly makes her ripe for radicalizing but its never clear who shes become or what shes up to. At work as a secretary for a TV network that resembles the BBC shes middle-class. Away from work she could pass for a Dickensian shop girl. An older rebellious man who works at the network stars in a broadly comic TV show that electrifies the nation by making a mockery of Englands dictator yet hes confident he wont be fired -- an inexplicable misjudgment on his part for what was obviously seditious conduct. V the only character with sufficient magnetism to hold the narrative together drops out for an extended period while Evey endures a hellish imprisonment thats contrived in more ways than one and in the end awfully silly. Natalie Portman as skillful as she is attractive does have her moments -- its affecting to see her hair being shaved like Joan of Arc -- but wide-eyed Evey whimpers endlessly and tediously on her way to becoming a fearless woman whos able to love. And speaking of love things go blooey instead of gooey whenever heroine and hero come close enough to touch; far from being sensual let alone erotic the movie proves to be not much fun at all. But then fun isnt high on the agenda crowded as it is with solemn debates about the role of terrorism in the face of tyranny. The movies heart a mechanical pump connected to a reservoir of adrenalin throbs for the smash finish in which the biggest bomb goes off and the Houses of Parliament come tumbling down along with Big Ben a frequent casualty in disaster movies. ""V for Vendetta"" wasnt meant to be a disaster movie of course and theres no reason to think it will be a disaster even though its original opening date of November 5th -- Guy Fawkes Day -- had to be pushed forward after real-life terrorists attacked London last July. These days filmmakers who play with fire dont get burned they get rich. Thank You for Smoking Of all the funny things in ""Thank You for Smoking"" and there are many the most striking is Robert Duvalls absolutely mirthless laugh. Mr. Duvalls role is small -- he plays a tobacco magnate called The Captain -- but the lesson of his performance is writ large Dont Call Attention to How Funny You Are. This lesson sometimes gets lost by a likable cast that includes Aaron Eckhart as Big Tobaccos incorrigible spokesman Nick Naylor who wants to promote smoking in movies; J.K. Simmons as Nicks boss BR; and William H. Macy as Nicks nemesis Senator Ortolan Finistirre. (Mr. Macy calls attention to how funny he is by giving an implacably mirthless performance.) Katie Holmes plays a tough investigative reporter who isnt supposed to be particularly funny though she is supposed to have a few scruples and doesnt. Jason Reitman directed in his feature debut and wrote this soft-hitting adaptation from Christopher Buckleys comic novel. Mr. Reitman is obviously talented but a little more faith in his audience wouldnt be misplaced.    DVD TIP When it comes to movies about bombs and London theres nothing more gripping than Alfred Hitchcocks ""Sabotage"" (1936) which was adapted from Joseph Conrads ""The Secret Agent."" (Hitchcock had already made a movie called ""The Secret Agent"" so he had to call this one something else.) The director didnt think much of it and Francois Truffaut agreed with him in their published conversations but Pauline Kael wrote that Hitch was wrong and she was right. Oskar Homolka and Sylvia Sidney are a husband and wife who manage a little movie house and live above it. Desmond Teeter is her younger brother who unwittingly carries a package containing a bomb on a London bus.

Rick Groen From Thursdays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Mar. 16 2006 1200AM EST Last updated Tuesday Mar. 17 2009 1027AM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English V for Vendetta Directed by James McTeigue Written by Andy and Larry Wachowski Starring Natalie Portman Hugo Weaving John Hurt Classification 14A 1/2 Oh V for Vendetta is just the start. Theres V for violence of course cause lots of landmarks get blown up real good. Theres V for voluminous too cause this flick does go on. And for verbose cause it sure likes to talk. And V for vicar cause the talk has a way of turning rather preachy. Yes dare I say verily there is in these frames a veritable planet of V-ness. Just dont expect any V for verisimilitude although thats seldom the case in any comic-book-turned-movie a genre not known for its subtle reality but occasionally applauded for its sheer fun. So clap a little for the bit of fun to be had here. It can be traced to David Lloyds graphic novel which written during the neo-conservative regime of the Thatcher years imagined a not-so-distant future with England fallen into a dystopian state under totalitarian rule. Go figure. Enter the Wachowski brothers Andy and Larry who having finished their travels through the looking glass of The Matrix trilogy apparently had enough time on their hands to set about converting Lloyds book into a screenplay. Which theyve done with a few amendments. Were still in the future but the brothers have updated the references in an effort to show how the sins of Thatcherdom have extended their stain right into the Tony Blair era. That noble work done all that remained was to hand over the directors reins to their erstwhile assistant -- one James McTeigue. He opens on a view of London gone grey under the fog of conformity. The dictatorship is headed by the malevolent Chancellor Sutler a despot content to confine his public appearances to a giant screen -- think Big Brother bred from Adolf and played by John Hurt with a goatee ugly enough to qualify as evil incarnate. In what seems like British gloating or maybe just wishful thinking a bout of exposition (more about that later) informs us that the once-powerful U.S.A. has succumbed to ""Godlessness"" (as if) leaving its unhappy denizens torn by civil war and plagued by ""Avian flu."" No such worries here. The English citizenry had the good sense to vote the Chancellor to power. Given the historical mistakes of ""Iraq"" and ""the coalition of the willing"" (bring on those topical asides) the Brits elected to sacrifice the velvet glove of freedom for the iron fist of security. That fist protruding from the long arm of the state police is where matters begin. A pair of brutal cops are threatening an innocent woman the cue for our anti-hero to race to the rescue. That would be V (Hugo Weaving). In look he favours a long-haired wig fronted by perfect bangs accessorized with a Guy Fawkes mask frozen into a perpetual half-smile the better to hide his severely burned face and to declare his anarchical talents with gunpowder. Lots of gunpowder planted under government buildings. He warms up with the Old Bailey courthouse which falls down kaboom to a Tchaikovsky tune. Expect more of the same at climax time. The gal saved by V is EV who spells her name Evey and works on TV the nasty state-controlled kind. But her heart isnt in it since she too is a budding young rebel. We know that from the montage that fills in her unfortunate past. Vs fiery history complete with the literal flames that defiled his body and forged his vengeful spirit gets the same montage treatment. Yep sometimes the exposition comes in the form of flashbacks. Other times (remember the U.S.A) its just spoken out loud and upfront. Either way the stuff tends to stick out like dried raisins in the white bread of the plot -- organic it aint. On a happier note EV is portrayed by Natalie Portman sporting for the occasion auburn locks and an English accent both suspiciously artificial in origin. As devotees of the entertainment press will doubtless know by now a narrative twist in her characters fate demands that Ms. Portman actually submit to a pair of barbers shears. Natalie Im willing to confirm does get all her hair shaved off. Her accent stays on more or less and the combination leaves her somewhere in the mid-Atlantic looking like a close cousin of Sinead OConnor. As for poor Weaving getting permanently stuck behind a porcelain mask does put a crimp in your acting style and a premium on your vocal chords. He settles for the low register of the highly articulate frequently quoting the Bard while showing off his V for vocabulary with predictable emphasis on such polysyllabic entries as vicissitude vivisection and veracity. Okay but wheres the promised modicum of fun you might be asking? Well it lies (shallowly I admit) in the comic-book inflation of the whole business. This is a dystopian movie that cant for a second be taken seriously and doesnt seem to mind -- in fact it seems eager for the audience to adopt its own frozen smile of demi-amusement. So we chortle at the hot-air aphorisms that should come with balloon captions (""Artists use lies to tell the truth; politicians tell lies to obscure the truth""). And we chuckle at the timely allusions appliqued for headline relevance (""I wonder how unfamiliar words like collateral and rendition became so frightening""). Here even the earnestness sounds amiable and the evil wipes clean with a damp tissue --its a cautionary tale-lite. Consequently when V invites us into his (inevitably) subterranean lair and reveals the great books and the fine paintings and all the other truthful art hes filched from the censorious ""Ministry of Objectionable Materials"" the scene plays against its own message but with such inadvertence its almost endearing. I mean a picture like Vendetta has nothing to fear from the thought police -- that would require thoughts. This is just darkness played bright a disposable object but hardly objectionable.

Natalie Portman is caught in Hugo Weavings clutches in V for Vendetta. Warner Bros. Pictures Set in a slightly futuristic world (London in 2020) Vendetta is an action thriller that also stimulates thought. The movie follows the story of a mysterious masked rebel who opposes a totalitarian regime set in Great Britain. Known only as V (The Matrixs Hugo Weaving) he protects the life of an innocent and idealistic young woman named Evey (Natalie Portman) as she is about to be attacked by thugs. But Vs artistic and intellectual goals are larger than saving one life. He wants to save the cowering populace from corruption and tyranny. He is branded a terrorist in a borderline post-apocalyptic time when fear of terrorism has reached hysteric proportions. V has integrity and a sense of altruism but he is driven by vengeance and is all too willing to resort to violence to set the world right. His obsessive vigilante fantasy is deeply troubling He wants to establish a new world order by blowing up the houses of Parliament. The cruelty he has been exposed to in a kind of concentration camp fuels his desire for revenge almost as much as the governments oppression of its citizens does. The films climactic resolution is ultimately an effort to purge civilization of its power-mad extremist and crushing forces. Some may find it upsetting given the terrorist attacks of 9/11. There is a sense of growing dread in anticipation of the climax. Ultimately however the disquieting Vendetta is bold and thought-provoking. Weaving is excellent as the masked crusader able to convey volumes with subtle fluid gestures and expressive vocal cadences. V has vague resonances of the operatic Phantom but with less obsessive love and more social conscience. There is a Pygmalion quality to the relationship between V and Evey and the film has echoes of A Clockwork Orange and Fahrenheit 451. Despite its disparate influences Vendetta feels captivatingly original. The multilayered film can be appreciated strictly as an action thriller or for its deeper message about personal responsibility political oppression and revolutionary change. One powerful theme centers on the notion that ideas live forever their power undiminished even as those who espouse them die. The film was written by the brothers responsible for the Matrix movies Larry and Andy Wachowski and is based on a graphic novel by Alan Moore. Though its a 20-year-old story V for Vendetta has serious and resounding implications for our time and place. (Opens Thursday nationwide. Rated R for strong violence and some language. Running time 2 hours 12 minutes.)

Running time 133 minutes. Rated R (violence profanity). At the Empire the 64th and Second the Lincoln Square IMAX others. JUST when we were ready to give up mainstream movies as braindeadalong comes the controversial and gleefully subversive ""V for Vendetta"" a piece of corporate-sponsored art that will have audiences rooting for a bomb-throwing anarchist. Loosely adapted by Larry and Andy Wachowski (""The Matrix "")from an 80s graphic novel by Alan Mooreand stylishly directed by the Wachowski s longtime assistant director James McTeiguethis is a thoughtful and highly entertaining conflation of ""The Phantom of the Opera "" and ""1984 "" that draws on many other pop culture sources. The futuristic setting is Britain in about 2020 where a totalitarian regime that rules through fear of terrorist attacks has carted off gaysMuslims and political dissidents to internment camps for medical experiments. V is an at least half-mad escapee from one of the camps.He was hideously burned in an explosion and hides behind a plastic mask with the ironically smiling visage of Guy Fawkesa Catholic dissident who unsuccessfully tried to blow up Parliament in 1605. After blowing up Old Baileyour knife-wielding Shakespeare-quoting hero hacks into the state-run TV network to vow he will succeed where Fawkes failedin a year s time. V s somewhat reluctant accomplice - at least at first - is Eveya gopher at the network who is rescued from an attack by government goons by V and taken to his lair filled with looted ""subversive "" art. Much to the film s credit and to the exasperation of its criticsthe audience is left to decide for itself whether V is a terrorist freedom fighter vengeance-seeking psychoticor maybe all three simultaneously - and whether his extreme actions are a justifiable response to government repression. This pretty heady stuff for a big-budget comic-book movieand McTeigue pulls it off with the help of a superlative cast. Though his face is hidden behind a maskHugo Weaving (Agent Smith of ""The Matrix "" movies)) makes V a romantic sympathetic and stirring character. Natalie Portman is an excellent Evey - her head is shaved in one intentionally disturbing sequence - who solidly portrays her character s politicizationeven though her British accent wavers. The Hitler-like Chancellor who rules the U.K.is most effectively played by John Hurt Winston Smith of the 80s version of ""1984 "")who appears mostly as a ""Big Brother ""-like TV image. Another unlikely performer for an event movie is Stephen Rea (""The Crying Game "")as a rumpled police detective tracking V and Evey who comes to question his government s motives. And Stephen Fry is superb as a closeted gay TV personality (with a Koran and Mapplethorpe prints in his closet)who helps Evey and signs his own death warrant when he ditches a censored script to poke fun at the Chancellor in a hilarious cross between ""The Great Dictator "" and ""Laugh-In."" ""V for Vendetta "" was scheduled to open last Novemberto coincide with the 400th anniversary of Guy Fawkes  arrestbut was postponedpresumably because of parallels between the film to last spring s attacks on the London Underground. Credit the Wachowski s clout in the wake of the ""Matrix "" successbut Warner Bros.has allowed them to update Moore s graphic novel with pointed contemporary references including a United States that has collapsed in the wake of the Iraq invasion - and a bullyingxenophobic TV host who is clearly modeled on today s cable television. Though it raises some important questions and is unusually talky for a big action moviethe fast-moving ""V for Vendetta ""subordinates its political lecture to an entertaining piece of pulp fiction.

Listen Toggle more options Download Embed Embed Transcript Facebook Twitter Google+ Email March 18 2006400 PM ET Heard on All Things Considered Bob Mondello Twitter A clean-shaven Natalie Portman and a masked Hugo Weaving take on the fascists in V for Vendetta. Warner Bros. hide caption toggle caption Warner Bros. The dark thriller with contemporary political overtones was adapted by the Wachowski brothers of Matrix fame. But the authors of the graphic novel written in the 1980s have distanced themselves from the film which follows a masked rebel battling a fascist state. DEBBIE ELLIOTT host From NPR News this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. Im Debbie Elliott. The film V for Vendetta is a dark futuristic fantasy from the folks who made the Matrix. Youd think releasing a new movie by this team would be easy since the three Matrix movies took in more than 1.6 billion. But V for Vendetta has had a tricky time getting to the screen. The opening was postponed last year when London was rocked by a subway bombing that was much like a scene in the film and the author of the graphic novel the movies based on has disowned it. Bob Mondello says he understands that impulse. BOB MONDELLO reporting The not-so-distant future. America has collapsed into civil strife and Britain is led by a dictator who has clamped down hard on society controlling the media banning speech and assembly and using thugs as enforcers. A sweet young thing named Evey falls afoul of the thugs after curfew one night and figures shes a goner when suddenly a rescuer materializes from the shadows looking very 17th century in a cape and Guy Fawkes mask and wielding a dagger. (Soundbite of V for Vendetta) MONDELLO The rescuer turns out to be a terrorist or freedom-fighter depending on your point of view who calls himself V. After regaling Evey with a speech of vivid verbiage virtually vibrating with Vs a fetish he thankfully abandons quickly he treats her to a rooftop view of a building hes blowing up then zips her home to an underground lair decorated with antiques movie posters and a jukebox playing jazz standards. As mad bombers go hes reasonably seductive as played by Hugo Weaving that mask he never takes off notwithstanding. Evey is soon though against her better judgment so involved in his schemes that shes in deep trouble. (Soundbite of V for Vendetta) Unidentified Man (in Film) Youve been formally charged with three counts of murder the bombing of government property conspiracy to commit terrorism treason and sedition the penalty for which is death by firing squad. You have one chance and only one chance to save your life. You must tell us the identify or whereabouts of Codename V. MONDELLO What to do? Go with the terrorist or with the fascist? In the movie the year is 2020 so itd be nice to report that Evey and everyone else sees perfectly what is going on but not even hindsight is 20-20 in V for Vendetta. The graphic novel written two decades ago was a portrayal of Maggie Thatcher-style conservatism run amuck. The movies regime has been updated to reflect a later style of conservatism. Its Big Brotherish leader is a religious extremist who is homophobic Islamaphobic just generally phobic really. The freedom-fighting terrorist hero meanwhile is sort of Batman by way of the Count of Monte Cristo. The problem is that V for Vendetta borrows from so many sources Creature from the Black Lagoon to real-life photos of Abu Ghraib that even the filmmakers cant keep them all straight. By the movies midpoint the Wachowski brothers screenplay has gotten so bogged down in back story that it takes 40 minutes for director James McTiegue to get back to the explosions that his 16-year-old target audience assumes will solve everything. Those 40 minutes are mostly taken up with mistreating Evey played by Natalie Portman who it should noted suffers adorably and looks terrific with her head shaved and theyre also taken up with establishing that V can be duplicated ad infinitum by putting half of London in plastic V masks. This is basically the same trick youll notice that the Wachowskis ran into the ground in their last two Matrix movies when they also had hundreds of cloned Hugo Weavings running around. It has not become cleverer with time alas something that can also be said of V for Vendetta in general. Im Bob Mondello. Copyright (c) 2006 NPR. All rights reserved.

Comments V for Vendetta Recommended A popcorn movie that preaches mass rebellion against the government--whats not to like? After milking The Matrix for two superfluous sequels writer-producers Andy and Larry Wachowski adapt a 1989 graphic novel by David Lloyd and Alan Moore; set in a futuristic Great Britain the movie follows a masked figure (Hugo Weaving) as he carries out a series of assassinations and tries to unite the cowed populace against a totalitarian national-security state. The swashbuckling first hour is superior to the second which bursts at the seams with backstory but a rousing climax makes this the most potent piece of agitpop in years. James McTeigue directed; with Natalie Portman Stephen Rea John Hurt and Stephen Fry. R 132 min. By J.R.

Resistance however is stirring in the unlikely form of an elusive insurgent known as V (Hugo Weaving) whose features hide behind a Guy Fawkes mask. Hes already blown up the Old Bailey and is promising that Westminster another emblem of institutionalised injustice will follow next year. It could be another November 5 to remember unless Stephen Reas dogged state investigator can locate the rebel icons secret lair though the latter may have found an ally in Natalie Portmans plucky TV researcher whose bitter past has its telling secrets too.Alan Moores original graphic novel begun in the early 80s reshaped the contours of Orwellian nightmare as an indictment of the Thatcher era though Moore has disassociated himself from this adaptation by the post-Matrix Wachowski brothers who somehow persuaded Warner Bros to bankroll a dystopian anti-Bush onslaught where the bomb-toting good guys cherish the banned Koran and the baddies are the government. Still audiences may not be rushing from the multiplexes to man the barricades just yet. Theyll have to wake up first because ideological frissons aside this is a strikingly soporific debut for the Wachowskis former assistant. Tantalising set-up in place it flounders for the next two hours desperately piling on exposition and flashback before a truly laughable would-be rabble-rousing finale. Decent performances notwithstanding this is both visually uninspired (the totalitarian iconography looks like 1984 with LCD screens) and ultimately unpersuasive in its posturing radical chic. For all its anti-establishment esprit its more a case of Z for Zzzz.

But thats not important. The central idea of mass revolution by anonymity is warmly presented. Theres enough style in the idea and the strangely powerful lead (Hugo Weaving) to immediately forgive and forget occasional clunkiness. It moves well enough under the radar and succeeds on its own peculiar terms.

The acting is also decent but what makes the film finally unsatisfying is first of all an incredible mess as if the director had wanted to make a cocktail  or a multiple ripoff of all the most famous films of the genre. This gives a terrible impression of dA(c)jA -vu. What ultimately sinks the film is its huge pretentiousness which results in a film that you would literally want to compress to a minimum size as you do it with video codecs but in this case compression would have definitely provided a better quality.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map },http://www.timeout.com/film/82701.html,200,vforvendetta8,vforvendetta,timeout

Starring Natalie Portman Hugo Weaving and John Hurt. Directed by James McTeigue. R. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Trooping out of ""V for Vendetta"" to the Rolling Stones ""Street Fighting Man"" a fitting accompaniment to the final credits you may be overcome by a sudden urge to storm the Bastille. This is inflammatory filmmaking with the burners turned up high. Dont go in expecting ""Matrix 4"" because the trilogys creators Andy and Larry Wachowski are being heavily promoted as the writers and producers. Their new effort is far more in the subversive tradition of ""The Battle of Algiers"" and ""A Clockwork Orange."" ""V for Vendetta"" would be worth seeing just as an anomaly a big-budget Hollywood release that could be interpreted as sticking it to the American and British governments by showing the catastrophic fates these countries meet in the not-too-distant future precipitated by disastrous policymaking. But ""Vendetta"" is also richly satisfying entertainment the way movies are at their best when they prod you to think. Making his first feature James McTeigue the Wachowski brothers longtime assistant director finds a tone and pacing that are appropriate to bring a portentous comic book to the screen. He takes it seriously without pretending that its Shakespeare. British graphic novelist Alan Moore wrote it in the 1980s as a harsh criticism of the political right. That the story has such resonance today indicates that Moore (who has disowned the movie) was on to something. The opening scene offers a quick lesson in English history. London in the 17th century is re-created to show infamous saboteur Guy Fawkes foiled in his attempt to blow up Parliament an act for which he is hanged in front of a mob of thousands. Theyre almost certainly computer generated but the special effects arent obvious. The film is almost old-fashioned in relying on solid storytelling instead of trickery to engage the audience. Flash forward way forward to London in 2020 or so. A totalitarian regime has taken control terrorizing citizens and routinely lying to them via a government-controlled TV station. Its unclear whether the news readers are telling the truth when they dryly report that the former United States is in a state of chaos brought on by a civil war. The British peoples self-appointed savior (Hugo Weaving) goes only by the letter V. But we know what that stands for. Sure enough hes hell-bent on bringing down the government by carrying out Fawkes failed mission. Keep the mental image of Weaving as the ""The Matrixs"" ubiquitous Mr. Smith because hes little more than a disembodied voice albeit one with majestic resonance perfect for intoning the long-forgotten principles of democracy. V is never seen without an eerie Fawkes mask covering his entire face -- the heavy lines of the eyebrows and mustache form semicircles around squinty eyes with the mouth glued shut. To hear his words coming from some other place takes some getting used to. Natalie Portman gives her strongest performance yet as Evey an orphan who slowly comes to understand the truth behind the deaths of her family. Even after Eveys hair is shaved off by torturers Portman keeps you focused on her words and actions instead of her bald head. V rescues her from government henchmen. Her deep brown eyes first reflect gratitude then horror when the terrorist brings her to his safe house and plots to keep her locked up there. Parallels to ""The Phantom of the Opera"" are obvious when V plays his jukebox for her (""Cry Me a River"" of all songs) and invites her for a spin around the floor. Light moments like their slow dancing or V fencing alongside ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" (""the one with Robert Donat"" he tells Evey distinguishing it from inferior remakes) come as a relief after relentless gloom and doom. Gruesome torture scenes seem intended to evoke both World War II concentration camps and Iraq. Persecution of gay people described in long letters written on toilet paper by a lesbian whos been incarcerated are another reminder of the Nazis as is Englands Hitler-like chancellor (a terrifyingly believable John Hurt). Times do change -- most of ""Vendetta"" was shot in Germany to save money. The chancellor appears on a large screen barking out orders to his underlings to stop V after he blows up the Old Bailey to the accompaniment of the ""1812 Overture."" Not one to miss an opportunity to show off V sets off fireworks around the incinerated building as if it were the Fourth of July. A chunk of the budget must have gone into impressively convincing scenes of British landmarks exploding. To the credit of everyone involved with this movie its about a lot more than explosions. Provocative thoughts are what rise up from the ashes. -- Advisory This film contains graphic violence and language.

If you answer no -- if you blanch just seeing the question in print -- keep far far away from V for Vendetta a gravely unsettling dystopian saga about a masked revolutionary bent on destroying the British Parliament. Vendettas answer is ""yes."" Yes a terrorist can be a hero. Yes violence can be justified even necessary in the fight against oppressive regimes. And yes in the words of V its alliterative desperado ""blowing up a building can change the world."" He has British architecture in mind but the twin shadows of the World Trade Center inevitably loom over this dense and glowering film which uses a futuristic totalitarian regime to skewer political fear-mongering and popular complacency in every age including this one. ""People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people"" declares V in the films most obvious call to arms. But as manifestoes go this ones a beauty draped like a funeral smart as a whip and full of black-hearted Romantic monologues and dramatically slit necks. Directed by James McTeigue (assistant director on the Matrix trilogy) from a script by Andy and Larry Wachowski (Matrix writer-directors) V for Vendetta is based on the seminally depressive graphic novel by writer Alan Moore and illustrator David Lloyd. Moore has loudly disowned the movie and wiped his name from the credits. But Lloyds name remains and if the movie veers from the book at times the filmmakers have worked hard to honor his creation. Most important they get V right. Hes charismatic; hes unhinged; hes obsessed with the letter ""V"" (""we will one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous""). With his Zorro hat Zorro cape signature consonant and pageboy flip he might seem fey but this crime fighter takes cover behind no weenie little scarf. Instead he wears a Fawkes mask in grinning homage to the Guy who conspired to blow up the Houses of Parliament in 1605. V atomizes the Old Bailey courthouse in the movies opening spectacle and he plans something similar for Parliament. He also plans to eliminate a long list of fascist nasties who had abused him in the past a tragic back story being the key to every anti-hero. He is exquisitely rapturously lonely -- lonely in a minor key with roses. When he rescues a woman (an impassioned Natalie Portman) she becomes his accomplice then his prisoner then his friend. He grows to love her in his silent wounded way (despite torturing her later on minor point). But still he never removes his mask. She cannot transform this Beast. Three things make this work. One is the silken power of Hugo Weaving as V whose elegant body language and lusciously textured line readings recall Claude Rains classic turns in The Phantom of the Opera and The Invisible Man. Two is the films unwavering air of apocalyptic dread held steady by Adrian Biddles noir-tinged cinematography and a masterful supporting cast that includes John Hurt as a hysterical despot Tim Pigott-Smith as his venal enforcer and Stephen Rea as a decent unflappable cop. Finally the script Its intelligent literate even talky focused on character over mere exploding buildings and crammed with allusions to Faust The Count of Monte Cristo Tchaikovskys 1812 and Beethovens Fifth Symphony. Fanboys will tell you the Beethoven is a nod to the Latin numeral five or ""V"" rendered in Morse code during the pieces opening theme (dit-dit-dit dah). Well why not? This is an erudite terrorist were talking about a truly educated man. And maybe thats the most heroic thing of all. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals SanDisk 128GB Cruzer Glide USB Flash Drive for 20 + pickup at...

By  Lisa Kennedy PUBLISHED March 15 2006 at 1236 pm | UPDATED May 8 2016 at 423 am Sign up for newsletters and alerts Submit your news tips or photos Most Popular Donald Trump stumps in Colorado promises ""No more Mr. Nice Guy"" Chris Harris INT injuries and 8 other observations from Day 2 of Broncos training camp Broncos offensive line can live with the blame game. Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Curled like a fetus in her prison cell Evey is about to be born anew. For Evey fear-the type fueled then set aflame by the manipulators of real vulnerability and intellectual laziness-has become a thing of the past. Hair shorn Natalie Portmans leading Evey looks like Maria Falconettis Joan of Arc ready for her end. Fear is just one of the powerful themes in the ka-pow ka-boom pleasure that is ""V for Vendetta."" James McTeigue directed and Andy and Larry Wachowski penned this rousing resonant tale based on a 1981 British comic-book series about an avenging hero his reluctant protege and the windbags of war and disaster. At the series completion it was published in 1989 as a graphic novel. As with many graphic novels ""V"" has a strain of paranoia and resignation running through it. Dystopian anxieties abound. The world is a bleak place full of wolves that seize the moment and sheep that have given into fear. Alan Moore and David Lloyd created ""V"" when Margaret Thatcher was British prime minister. AIDS xenophobia and the passive yet persuasive tyranny of television weighed on their minds. Dark yet vibrant ""V"" freshens these themes for a not-so-new era. In the near future Evey and her fellow citizens have much to fear. A rampant virus and global warfare have ushered in a government that tends to its citizens needs by telling them what they are. Slack-jawed Brits watch the news-spinning British Television Network where Evey works. TV personality Prothero (Roger Allam) the ""Voice of London"" riffs on religion and retribution. The nations motto plastered on curfew-emptied streets reads ""Strength Through Unity. Unity Through Faith."" While England remains the setting for ""V"" the United States is never quite out of the picture. Thanks to a war the ""former colonies"" undertook Brittania once again rules this time with an iron fist not unlike a Fuhrer it once faced. The isle is not an Empire so much as it is a hermetically sealed compound. Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt) confers with his police-state minions via a very big screen. Hurts casting is a cheeky bit of irony. He played the tormented bureaucrat in the 1984 version of ""1984"" George Orwells tale of jackboot stomping and group-think. But a challenge to the status quo lurks in the shadows. On the eve of Guy Fawkes Day Nov. 5 an over-enunciating masked man begins his assault. V uses Fawkes the foot soldier in the failed 1605 Gunpowder Plot to blow up Parliament as his patron saint of payback. The mask V wears beneath a fedora is frozen in a permanent smile. He is a courageous and contemptuous jester created by those in power. And hes intent on meeting and unmaking his makers. ""V"" is part joy ride part cautionary thriller part manifesto. Like many a manifesto it is bold with ideas even as its rife with contradictions. Played by Hugo Weaving V is not meant to be an easy hero. To borrow his penchant for alliteration V vexes. His mission is grand but dogged by too personal an agenda. Driven by vengeance hes tempered by love. The relationship between Evey and V is understated. Although there is a love that dares speak its name in ""V"" it comes via a missive written by a political prisoner she never meets. Portman serves her woman-child character well making believable Eveys journey from naif to thoughtful citizen. Stephen Rae is Chief Inspector Finch a detective tracking V and Evey. Something in the Irish actors hangdog demeanor always makes him more friend than foe even when hes clearly on the wrong side of the law. Stephen Fry gives a winning turn as Dietrich an on-air personality who is more than we first suspect. McTeigue (first assistant director on the ""Matrix"" movies) handles the Wachowskis abundant pop-cultural references with verve. Like many dystopian fables V could be preparing us for the worst with visions of our own complicity or priming us to seize that which we resist in ourselves. Consider this a hint of what the movie wishes for us When V first takes Evey to his lair the two watch a movie. It is Vs favorite the 1934 version of ""The Count of Monte Cristo."" ""Does it have a happy ending?"" she asks warily. ""As only celluloid can"" V replies with the weight of the worlds melancholy but also its hope.  | ""V for Vendetta"" R for strong violence and some language|2 hours 10 minutes|GRAPHIC NOVEL FABLE|Directed by James McTeigue; written by the Wachowski brothers; photography by Adrian Biddle; starring Natalie Portman Hugo Weaving Stephen Rae Stephen Fry John Hurt Sinead Cusack Natasha Wightman| Opens today at area theaters and the IMAX at the Colorado Center.

First-time director James McTeigues big bold imagery with slashing reds and blacks is a close approximation of the novels look and feel.But this is primarily a technical achievement. ""V For Vendetta"" even more so than with most graphic-novel adaptations also arrives with a full arsenal of ""ideas."" Although the ""Vendetta"" comic as a continuing serial goes back to the early 80s and was published in full under the DC Comics banner in 1989 the movie version is obviously aimed at the here and now.Set in the near future in an England ruled by tyrants whose party insignia bears a close resemblance to a swastika ""V For Vendetta"" plays on our fears of a modern world gone mad.

The countrys uber-leader played by John Hurt as an immense talking head on a digital TV screen is an Orwellian nightmare. (Hurt played Winston Smith in the movie version of 1984. Guess he wanted to check out the dark side.) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Enter V (Hugo Weaving) the renegade savior in black flowing cape and Zorro hat who lives in an underground lair that resembles the Bat Cave. V wears a mask with a great big gargoyle smile that is meant to summon up the spirit of Guy Fawkes who unsuccessfully attempted to blow up Parliament in 1605. This time V means to get the job done right. Enlisting the assistance of a wary waif Evey (Natalie Portman) whose dissident parents have been eliminated by the government he carries out a series of terrorist assassinations in his yearlong countdown to the big bang.There is no reason of course why graphic novels or the movies adapted from them should not be charged with ideas. But ""V for Vendetta"" comes on strong in a manner that is much closer to ""The Matrix"" than to Orwell. This is not surprising since the project was originally developed by the Wachowski brothers who are also its credited screenwriters.Its easy to see what attracted the Wachowskis to this material Its dark and doomy and clogged with worlds-within-worlds. Like ""The Matrix"" movies its futurism is conceived of in almost sado-masochistic terms - its torture scenes in particular. The cautionary political material may seem ""daring"" but I think its just an elaborate form of window-dressing for an apocalyptic freak show.The filmmakers have been careful to describe the movie as an open-ended vision that does not endorse mayhem and points no fingers in any particular political direction. But the contemporary references which include US involvement in Iraq are inescapable and its drift is clear. V comes across as the most stricken romantic since ""The Phantom of the Opera"" albeit a phantom who is fond of saying things like ""blowing up a building can change the world"" or ""beneath this mask are ideas and ideas are bulletproof.""When he starts eliminating the bad guys on his list one by one you may think for a moment that youre back watching ""Munich"" but the emotional high point of the movie is clearly meant to be the scene where Evey kisses Vs mask and they dance together. In his ripest ""Masterpiece Theatre"" tones V declares that ""a world without dancing is a world not worth having."" I guess were supposed to think that anybody who can waltz like this guy cant possibly be a terrorist. Grade B Rated R for violence and language.Sex/Nudity 4 scenes of innuendo 1 scene of a near rape and 1 scene with nude bodies in a mass grave. Violence 28 scenes. Profanity 48 instances including 12 harsh ones. Drugs/Alcohol/Tobacco 8 scenes of smoking and/or drinking.

"V for Vendetta | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; v-for-vendetta ) V for Vendetta (United States/Germany 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli V for Vendetta represents 2006s first memorable motion picture - a visually sumptuous concoction that combines political allegory bloody action and a few stunning cinematic moments into a solid piece of entertainment. While its true that the film at times overreaches and its connection to its graphic novel inspiration is tenuous V for Vendetta mostly succeeds playing in the same sci-fi thriller arena as Aeon Flux and Ultraviolet. First-time director James McTeigue is relentless when it comes to pacing rarely letting things flag for extended scenes of flabby explosion. And if there are times when V for Vendetta is overwrought and chaotic those lapses are easily forgotten in the midst of the rousing nature of the experience. Its 2020 London and the world is in turmoil. Across the ocean the United States has collapsed into civil war caused by plague poverty and civil unrest. Things are calmer in England due to the totalitarian reign of fascist dictator Adam Sutler (John Hurt) whose bedtime reading is likely to be Mein Kampf. Terror roams the streets at night not only in the form of the Chancellors thuggish enforcers but in the masked person of ""V"" (Hugo Weaving) a mysterious swashbuckling figure whose features are hidden behind the plastic likeness of Guy Fawkes. Previously unknown he is about to become the most infamous individual in the city a dark knight who inspires the people and enrages the authorities. Evey (Natalie Portman) a TV station gopher and aspiring actress is on her way home after curfew when Sutlers brutes corner her with the intention of rape - or worse. She is saved from her fate by V who dispatches her attackers without effort. He then invites her to watch a ""performance"" he has orchestrated the explosive destruction of the Old Bailey complete with fireworks choreographed to the strains of Tchaikovskys ""1812 Overture."" The date is November 5 (""Remember remember the fifth of November?"") and the action is the opening salvo in Vs one-man attempt to topple Sutler and his right-hand man Creedy (Tim Pigott-Smith). He offers Evey the chance to join him but she is frightened and seeks sanctuary with television personality and co-worker Deitrich (Stephen Fry). Meanwhile a police investigation led by Inspector Finch (Stephen Rea) begins a search for the identity of the terrorist V. V for Vendetta is a series of moments. From the destruction of the Old Bailey to Vs introductory monologue (where nearly every other word begins with the letter ""v"") to the toppling of a massive number of dominoes to the final blood-soaked battle the movie offers plenty of chances for nape hairs to stand on end. (Must be the Tchaikovsky that did it for me?) The plot is a little dense at times with the whodunit? elements never quite mixing with the edgier thriller aspects. And the Guy Fawkes stuff (he was a Catholic extremist who tried to blow up Parliament on November 5 1605) seems extraneous (probably because Im an American). There are plenty of ideas. Some would argue thats what the screenwriters the Wachowski Brothers are best at - giving viewers things to think about. Although theres a fine line between smart material and over-the-top hokum V for Vendetta mostly stays on the right side of the demarcation. The movie asks questions about the price were willing to pay by giving up freedom to feel safe (a far cry from ""Give me liberty or give me death"") and argues that the term ""terrorist"" is defined by perspective. Theres an eerie speech about the power inherent in the destruction of a symbolic building that will have nearly every American envisioning the shadow of Osama bin Laden looming over the World Trade Center. From a visual standpoint V for Vendetta bears the earmarks of a comic book-to-film adaptation rich images deep shadows and strong iconography. Although not on par with Sin City which is more like a graphic novel come to life V for Vendetta has the power to arrest the viewers attention. Yet by keeping the perspective that of a na?ve girl dragged into this brutal struggle McTeigue ensures that the human element is not lost. The co-creator of the source material Alan Moore has distanced himself from the cinematic version but this V for Vendetta works on its own terms. No awards will be handed out for acting. Beneath the mask and cowl of V Hugo Weaving isnt required to do more than appear imposing and concentrate on his vocals. Its an anonymous role that anyone could play. (In fact Weaving replaced James Purefoy when he left after citing ""creative differences"" with the filmmakers.) Natalie Portman is solid and particularly good during the torture scenes and their aftermath but this isnt the most representative example of her range and she is plagued by an inability to develop a consistent British accent. (The schoolgirl costume she wears during one scene will have fetishists drooling however.) Stephen Rea is suitably low-key as the hangdog policeman. And John Hurt gets to salivate and chew on the scenery in a way that he hasnt been able to in years. V for Vendetta plunders a variety of pop culture sources. Some of the references are from the graphic novel; others are unique to the movie. Without overthinking or digging too deep viewers will be able to identify parallels with 1984 The Matrix The Phantom of the Opera Zorro and even Star Wars. V for Vendetta can be seen as a political allegory but its not as blatant a comment on current events as some reviewers might claim. Still if you want to go down that road the associations are there to explore. For those who would prefer to simply enjoy this textured futuristic tale of love loss and mayhem V for Vendetta satisfies for the entirety of its two-plus hour run.

Helmed by James McTeigue pic suffers from many of same problems as last two installments of producers Andy and Larry Wachowskis ""Matrix"" franchise. Pic should open with a bang in late March but may fizzle quickly. Although often visually striking and undercoated by a compelling sci-fi concept graphic-novel adaptation ""V for Vendetta"" feels flat as a storyboard. Chiming faintly with current counterculture vibe in higher-browed films dystopian ""Vendetta"" posits a masked ""terrorist"" hero (Hugo Weaving) trying to overthrow a fascist state in future Blighty. Helmed by James McTeigue pic suffers from many of same problems as last two installments of producers Andy and Larry Wachowskis ""Matrix"" franchise indigestible dialogue pacing difficulties and too much pseudo-philosophical info. Pic should open with a bang in late March but may fizzle quickly. Alan Moore the author of the much admired graphic novel ""V for Vendetta"" disassociated himself from this production and had his name removed from the credits. This should make his fan base extra wary especially since two critically panned pics (""From Hell"" ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"") have already been hatched from options sold on Moores work. Plot differs substantially from the written version which was issued complete as a graphic novel in 1989. Simplified movie version penned by the Wachowski brothers gamely tries to retain key plot points that will serve as mass market entertainment while half-heartedly updating Moores allegorical digs at Thatchers Britain in the 80s to reflect current leftist fears about what a future totalitarian state might repress -- not just homosexuality but Islam too. Brit auds however may feel pic has missed a trick by not taking a sharper swipe at Tony Blairs regime. Opening prologue shows Guy Fawkes the Catholic conspirator who tried to blow up Parliament in 1605 and whose ""treason"" is remembered every Nov. 5 in the U.K. with fireworks displays. Post-credits story shifts to 2020 after worldwide unrest mysterious deadly viral outbreaks and fear have caused the populace to elect a neo-fascist state run by demagogic Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt). On Nov. 4 TV station gopher Evey (Natalie Portman) is saved from a gang of Fingermen thuggish quasi-police agents intent on raping her by V (Weaving) a poetry-spouting caped avenger wearing a Guy Fawkes mask who at midnight blows up the Old Bailey Londons central criminal court. The government tries to spin the explosion but V breaks into the station where Evey works and manages to get his revolutionary anti-Sutler message broadcast promising to blow up Parliament in exactly a years time. While at the station he also saves Evey from two coppers Finch (Stephen Rea) and his sidekick Dominic (Rupert Graves) whove come to arrest her. Pic next metronymically crosscuts between V killing off various characters who wronged him and Finch and Dominic investigating the murders which leads to lots of explicatory flashbacks. Thesping lineup offers an embarrassment of riches which unfortunately the weak helming by McTeigue rather squanders. Bambi-eyed Portman cries affectingly and looks fetching with a shaved head but her character is essentially passive and not especially interesting. (Portmans accent also wavers distractingly across classes from Cockney to middle-England posh.) Meanwhile the film suffers as its most active character V is hidden behind a mask and helmeted with one of Chers old Cleopatra-style wigs for almost the entire running time. Weaving tries hard with voice and movement to add expression but theres still nearly zero chemistry between the leads. Supports cast predictably are mostly just OK. Sinead Cusack as one of Vs victims manages to register one of pics few moments of emotional complexity. Helming debutant McTeigue cites in press notes that 1965s ""The Battle of Algiers"" was one of the films stylistic inspirations but evidence here suggests he may be thinking of an entirely imaginary film that bears no relation to that docudrama classic. Perhaps helmer thinks that the trite cutaways in ""Vendetta"" to stereotypically ordinary Brits roused by Vs message bear some likeness to the fervid mix of minor characters in Gillo Pontecorvos film. In the end competent but bland craft contributions ensure pic looks less like sci-fi stalwarts ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""Fahrenheit 451"" and more like ""Batman Begins"" or ""Van Helsing."" Action sequences are serviceable but disappointing given the Wachowski pedigree the most striking being the final carve-up between V and a room full of heavies. Pic is thankfully light on CGI work and gets its most rousing moments from old-fashioned pyrotechnics and of all things a huge domino cascade. V for VendettaU.S.-Germany ProductionA Warner Bros.
