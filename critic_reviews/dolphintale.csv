Dolphin Tale is based on the story of Winter a bottlenose dolphin rehabilitated at Floridas Clearwater Marine Hospital after becoming tangled in a rope at sea. Regrettably the dolphin has its tail amputated. But in a rousing case of humanity Winters carers - pulling out all the stops - persuade a prosthetics expert to mould a new tail for the perpetually smiley creature. Before long the mammal has become an inspiration to scores of humans with equally impeding disabilities. Director Charles Martin Smith and the films writers transform the story into a sentimental bonding tale about a withdrawn fatherless youngster called Sawyer Nelson (Nathan Gamble) whose own demons are exorcised by spending time with the recuperating mammal. Smiths uneven ET-like cliche fest comes packaged with all the trappings of the earnest melodramatic crowd-pleaser - even Morgan Freemans there along with composer Mark Ishams swooning strings. But as much as it grates it still manages to warm the cockles.

At area theaters. In 2005 a baby bottlenose dolphin was injured when it became tangled in the ropes of a crab trap off Floridas Gulf Coast. Humans intervened. Over time the dolphin -- who picked up the name Winter -- became an inspiration to countless people facing their own physical challenges. What a bonanza of poignancy the makers of ""Dolphin Tale"" had in this true saga of rescue tenacity and recovery. Too bad the screenplay is often more artificial than the prosthetic tail Winters human champions make for her. Its not for lack of heart. On the way to summer school Sawyer Nelson (Nathan Gamble) comes to the aid of a beached dolphin. When the mammal is taken by marine biologist Clay Haskett (Harry Connick Jr.) and his crew including chatterbox daughter Hazel (newcomer Cozi Zuehlsdorff) Sawyer seeks them out. The son of single mom Lorraine (Ashley Judd) Sawyer is a tinkerer a loner especially once his loving cousin goes off to war. In Winter and the gang at the Clearwater Marine Hospital he finds a porpoise er purpose. Directed by Charles Martin Smith ""Dolphin Tale"" honors the human-animal connection and delves into the psychology of loss. And it makes a thoughtful argument that a childs aptitude can take myriad forms. It also highlights the connection between Winter and soldiers coming home with grievous injuries when Sawyers soldier cousin Kyle (Austin Stowell) a championship swimmer returns. Its at the VA hospital that Sawyer meets Dr. Cameron McCarthy (Morgan Freeman) a brainiac conjurer of prosthetic devices. See? Plenty of ambition. But the dialogue can be tin-eared and the comedy has a cater- to-kids quality that sells youngsters short. Connick and Kris Kristofferson (who plays his father) know how to end-run the scripts sentimentality without sacrificing whats authentically touching. For his part Freeman has mildly hammy fun accentuating the good doctors eccentricity. And the movie takes delight in depicting the process and pleasures of invention with teasing graphics and high-fives all around.

P Nathan Gamble in ""Dolphin Tale"" (Warner Bros. Pictures) Warner Bros. Pictures Nathan Gamble (left) and Harry Connick Jr. in ""Dolphin Tale"" (Warner Bros. Pictures) Dolphins may be smarter than humans but they dont have opposable thumbs so they cant do life-saving surgery -- or make movies about it. Thats where humans come in.""Dolphin Tale"" is a true story of animal rescue and it even stars the sea creature to whom it happened. But its the humans who do the cutesy tricks that make it a mixed blessing.When a young dolphin gets caught in a crab trap and washes ashore a friendless 11-year-old boy named Sawyer (Nathan Gamble) finds and comforts it until the arrival of a veterinarian. Dr. Clay Haskett (Harry Connick Jr.) runs a ramshackle aquatic hospital with the help of his grizzled father (Kris Kristofferson) and spunky daughter Hazel (Cozi Zuehlsdorff). When Hazel sneaks Sawyer into the closed facility to see the dolphin named Winter the boy and the animal lift each others spirits. But Winter has an injured tail that requires amputation and without it she cant swim. So Sawyer who continually ditches summer school (to mother Ashley Judds dismay) approaches a prosthetics engineer (Morgan Freeman) to construct an artificial tail.The core story about the boy and the dolphin is touching but its tethered to creaky subplots that skim the surface of serious issues. Hazels father and Sawyers mother are single parents. Sawyer has a cousin (Austin Stowell) who was a star swimmer but returns from Afghanistan with a leg brace. The cash-strapped aquarium is besieged by both a hurricane and a predatory developer. Yet all of these obstacles are easily surmounted like when a hastily arranged fundraiser for Winter attracts media coverage and thousands of donors. Instead of steering toward deep and troubled waters ""Dolphin Tale"" jumps through hoops to engage a young audience.

"Dolphin Tale review Huckleberry fin |       NJ.com comments Dolphin Tale review Huckleberry fin Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 23 2011 at 734 AM View/Post Comments Harry Connick Jr. Morgan Freeman and Nathan Gamble in ""Dolphin Tale."" Lonely kids single parents injured animals cold-hearted developers keep-your-chin-up struggles and wise Morgan Freeman. Yeah ""Dolphin Tale"" pretty much hits all the family-film bases. And that it manages to be not insufferable while still being so predictable is a small tribute to its cast and crew. The cast includes -- in addition to the perpetually sagacious Freeman -- Kris Kristofferson Ashley Judd and Harry Connick Jr. All have been in better things and should be again but theyre certainly pleasant additions to the goings-on here. Young Nathan Gamble meanwhile -- as our boy in love with a bottlenose -- avoids the usual child-star traps being neither tirelessly cute (a problem for one of his young co-stars) or tiresomely sullen. He seems like a nice but normal kid and he helps take us on this journey. Its based -- barely -- on a true story about a dolphin named Winter. Rescued off the Florida coast it seemed too badly injured to live. Until its medical team began to wonder People with disabilities get prosthetic limbs. Why not give a disabled dolphin a prosthetic tail? Of course it got a bit more complicated than that -- dolphins arent exactly good with buckling things on (or wearing them for long). And the screenplay gets even more complicated as it introduces all sorts of fictional elements to turn this story into a movie. Luckily actor-turned-director Charles Martin Smith -- Terry the Toad for you ""American Graffiti"" fans -- brings a deft touch to the drama. Perhaps its because he starred years ago in a very nice nature film ""Never Cry Wolf."" Perhaps its because ""Air Bud"" -- a family film starring a golden retriever which my own children once kept on heavy rotation at home -- is among his directing credits. But whatever the reason Smith knows how to handle things. He doesnt overplay the troubled-kid melodrama while still nicely emphasizing the human/beast bond. And several otherworldly sequences -- one featuring some beautiful underwater photography and another showing whimsically dancing blueprints -- jump off the screen even if you arent seeing this film at one of its 3-D engagements. Not quite as three-dimensional are some of the scripts third-act developments which include a disabled little girl an injured heros war story several inspirational speeches and a hurricane. By the time of a last-ditch fundraising attempt its all a little exhausting -- at least if youre trying to tote up all the cliches. But most of it will be new to grade schoolers. And if youre the accompanying guardian thanks to Smith and Co. little of it will be hard to take. Ratings note The film contains some mildly scary moments. Dolphin Tale (PG) Warner Bros. (107 min.)

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 23 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Sep. 22 2011 551PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The curse of the dolphin according to Ric OBarry the former Flipper trainer and the anti-dolphin hunting activist featured in the 2009 documentary The Cove is that they have smiley faces. Thats made the intelligent trainable animals particularly popular kidnap victims to be put in aquariums around the world and thus a favourite subjects for kids toys and movies. With Dolphins Tale a 3-D family film by the same production team that brought us The Blind Side a potentially appealing story about a rescued disabled dolphin gets smothered with inspirational family values guff. Based on the true case of a juvenile female dolphin who had her tale amputated after injuring it in a crab trap off the coast of Florida in 2005 the film spreads the pathos around with numerous fictional embellishments. Along with the wounded dolphin there are two kids with single parents an embittered Afghanistan war veteran amputee a marine animal hospital under threat from creditors and both Kris Kristofferson and Morgan Freeman offering gruff wisdom. At the core of the movie is a familiar story of a lonely boy and his special animal friend Here the films best asset is Nathan Gamble ( The Dark Knight Babel) as Sawyer a solemn 11-year-old living in Clearwater Fla. with his nurse mother (Ashley Judd) after dad has abandoned them. When Sawyers soldier cousin Kyle (Austin Stowell) an Olympic swimming hopeful is shipped overseas Sawyer is left with nothing to look forward to but remedial summer school. All this changes one morning when Sawyer on his way to school sees a beached dolphin caught in a trap. He helps a marine animal rescue crew free the animal before they take it away to the nearby marine animal hospital and later he skips school to check on its health. The dolphin now dubbed Winter is under the care of the family who run the place Veterinarian dad Clay (Harry Connick Jr.) his chipper home-schooled daughter Hazel (Cozi Zuehlsdorff) a comically intrusive pelican and Grandpa Reed (Kristofferson) who share quarters on a houseboat. After the first glimmer of hope - only Sawyer can get Winter to eat - the crises come in swarms. Sawyers absenteeism from school is discovered and it looks as though hes going to be banned from seeing Winter. Next the dolphins injured tail has to be amputated. Damage from a hurricane pushes the hospital into hopeless debt. And Sawyers cousin comes home from the war injured and depressed. Finally it turns out that Winters new way of swimming - twisting her body back and forth rather than waggling her tale up and down - may cause a spinal injury and death. Too grim? Never worry. This is the kind of film where each setback proves a new opportunity for life lessons about friendship family and resilience. Having stacked the deck against the animal the script engineers a series of miracles from aid offered by twinkling prosthetics specialist (Freeman) to Kyles recovery and emergence as a community leader to a handy visit by a Richard Branson-like tycoon. Only the final documentary footage - of kids with disabilities visiting the aquarium to see the dolphin - rescues a genuine inspirational note to the films conclusion. And the dolphin Winter who plays herself smiles gamely through it all.

(Handout) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday September 23 2011 400 AM Title Dolphin Tale A boy tries to save a tailless dolphin. At area theaters (147). PG mature themes.Most of the family films churned out today are so junky its almost a shock to find one in which the animals never spout sassy one-liners or show off their hilarious hip-hop moves.In this based-in-truth story a beached dolphin named Winter (played by the actual Winter) is discovered by Sawyer (Nathan Gamble) the lonely son of a single mom (Ashley Judd). A marine biologist (Harry Connick Jr.) worries that without a tail Winter might not survive. However the doctor (Morgan Freeman) at a nearby veterans hospital has some creative suggestions.Overlong at nearly two hours the story packs in far too much from multiple crises to several montages. But the actors are appealing the dolphin charming and the story unabashedly wholesome. So while director Charles Martin Smith doesnt break new ground he does respect his audience. Which in an era of animals who never shut up feels almost revolutionary itself.Magic Moment Pretty much every moment the real Winter is onscreen.

I get paid to think about things too much and effective as the movie is it nevertheless left me slightly put off. This is the tale of a tail -- Winter is a dolphin that washes up on a Florida beach tangled in a crab trap the circulation cut off to its lower extremity. The adolescent who finds it Sawyer (Nathan Gamble) learns from a marine vet (Harry Connick Jr.) whose daughter Hazel (Cozi Zuehlsdorff) is about Sawyers age that Winters tail has to be amputated. A dolphin can swim without a tail -- but only by using a side-to-side wiggle that gradually destroys its spine. So this animal needs a prosthesis or itll die. An animal lover myself I nevertheless refer to Winter as ""it"" for a reason (though everyone in the film refers to the mammal as ""she""). The dolphin is a charmer -- may I call it slick? -- and director Charles Martin Smith creates many tender quiet moments such as the one when Winter is discovered on the beach forlorn wrecked and seemingly destined for the nearest StarKist factory. That Winter is a real dolphin playing roughly its own life story adds an additional layer of poignancy -- and in the end hope. But dolphins arent as important as humans are they? Theyre especially not as important as say wounded military veterans returning home to discover they can no longer walk. I wouldnt bring up such a comparison -- except the film does drawing a strangely frivolous parallel between the dire condition of Winter and that of Kyle (Austin Stowell) Sawyers college-age cousin who is like Winter Sawyers soulmate and a champion swimmer who suffers a cruel injury. We dont learn where Kyle gets his battle wound or what happened to him except that it involved an explosion that caused nerve damage. He still has both legs but one of them doesnt work and might be permanently disabled. Kyles story is in short massively more important than whether a marine mammal lives or dies. So why is he kept in the background while everyone talks incessantly about Winter? Why must he endure an insulting snap-out-of-it speech from the local prosthetics guru (Morgan Freeman doing a sort of ""Sesame Street"" take on his ""Batman Begins"" inventor)? Why really is he in this film at all? Answer for tearjerking purposes in support of that tearjerking porpoise. Once were all good and sad about everything thats going wrong the movie can begin the big heal. I dont think wounded veterans of ongoing overseas wars should be used in quite this facile a manner nor am I persuaded that little kids need to be exposed to such heavy themes but this is a film from Alcon Entertainment the producer of ""The Blind Side"" which is not shy about going for the waterworks. Both kids have lost a parent (Sawyers dad ran away; Hazels mom died) and in another scene a little girl with one leg visits Winter saying ""Shes just like me."" From her Sawyer gets the idea that Winter is a celebrity whose fame can be used for fund-raising. Note which way the aid direction points He doesnt say ""Gee maybe we can use Winter to give comfort to little kids with disabilities."" Earlier theres an even more blatant episode of pandering. The boy drops out of summer school with the blessing of his mom (Ashley Judd) on the theory that hell learn more at the dolphin hospital than at a remedial grammar class. This would have been an excellent opportunity to tell Sawyer that work is the price we pay for hobbies and if he hopes to be a marine biologist hes going to need to master grammar and a lot of other rigorous classes. As it is hes failing everything and seems poised to someday hold the title of minimum-wage chum-bucket assistant at SeaWorld. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next New Dragon Tattoo trailer revealed Read Next New Dragon Tattoo trailer revealed Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 49603 How Hillary blew her big moment 23138 Malia Obama skipped the DNC for Lollapalooza 20719 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary Jill and Joe Biden stop traffic on Fifth Avenue Ex-Focus Features CEO thanks company for firing him SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Starring Morgan Freeman Ashley Judd Harry Connick Jr. Kris Kristofferson Nathan Gamble Cozi Zuehlsdorff Austin Stowell Director Charles Martin Smith Running time 152 Release Opened Sep 23 2011  Editorial Review Nearly drowning in Hollywood sapBy Sean OConnellFriday Sep 23 2011Chances are youve heard this ""Dolphin Tale"" before. Winter the artificially enhanced mammal at the heart of Charles Martin Smiths new family drama has been profiled on CNN NBCs ""The Today Show"" and in countless newspapers across the country. She might be the only dolphin in the world with her own Web site (www.seewinter.com) Facebook page and Twitter account. But even if youre among those who wouldnt know Winter from Flipper you should have no trouble plugging into the films relaxed and enjoyably unhurried pace because Smith has delivered such a heartwarmingly hokey and accessible production. And parents dont be surprised if your youngest ones are inspired by ""Tale"" to conduct additional research into this remarkable dolphins triumphant story of perseverance. Its a whale of a tale made more special by being predominantly true. Winter the dolphin was 3 months old when crab nets entangled her off the shores of Floridas Gulf coastline. Marine biologists at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium rescued Winter and nursed her back to health in their facility but not before they had to surgically remove her badly damaged tail. The operation that saved Winters life actually created fresh problems. As the dolphin developed irregular swim patterns to compensate for the lost tail she risked permanently destroying her spine and internal organs. Something had to be done. A documentary detailing Winters miraculous medical journey might have stripped away the Disney-fied fluff that clings to Smiths ""Dolphin Tale"" like barnacles on the belly of a whale. (Its worth noting that Warner Bros. not Disney is behind the feature yet that studio still borrows plenty of manipulative tricks from the Mouse Houses time-tested playbook.) By running Winters unique biography through the conventional Hollywood filter Smith reduces ""Dolphin Tale"" to ""Old Yeller"" with a blowhole. As predictable as the tides it adheres firmly to the age-old kid-and-their-pet template tapping sentimental beats as it mixes in cheesy comic relief (a clumsy toy helicopter sequence; the presence of a pesky pelican named Rufus) to entertain kids in the theater. With Hollywood gloss comes Hollywood star power. Instead of narrating the story - which is what he would have done had ""Dolphin Tale"" actually been a documentary - Morgan Freeman appears on screen as Dr. McCarthy an engineer of prosthetic limbs who assists spunky young kids Sawyer (Nathan Gamble) and Hazel (Cozi Zuehlsdorff) by custom-designing an artificial tail for Winter. Ashley Judd swells with the proper amount of parental pride at her son Sawyers newfound interest in marine life. Harry Connick Jr. convincingly portrays Hazels father Clay the biologist in charge of Winters treatment. Everyone involved buys into the films underlying message of ""family is forever"" as well as the third-act connection established between Winter and Kyle (Austin Stowell) a wounded military veteran coping with an artificial leg who found inspiration in the dolphins struggle. The real star of course is Winter who plays herself and rightfully steals every scene. I might disagree with some of Smiths choices in telling Winters story (the 3-D for example is unnecessary) but I completely understand his desire to share Winters accomplishments. If you see ""Dolphin Tale"" stay through the end credits where the director attaches news footage and home movies capturing this remarkable creature as she interacts with young children test drives her new tail and poses for photos with military veterans who sport similar limbs made from artificial materials. The clips are brief but the emotions are genuine reminding us that the sequel to this uplifting story continues every day on Facebook Twitter and Winters own Web page.

PicturesSubmerging all doubts Sawyer (Nathan Gamble) bonds with Winter (who plays herself) after he saves her from a trap.Sponsored LinksThis is not only kid-friendly fare but a lovely family movie. The story of healing and courage is told with a refreshing lack of cynicism not surprising since its from the same producers as the wonderful My Dog Skip.Eleven-year-old Sawyer (Nathan Gamble) happens upon a dolphin stuck in a crab trap and stops to free the animal. The grateful dolphin immediately identifies him as her savior bonding with the sad-eyed boy.Though only in middle school Sawyer has had to endure a fair amount of personal loss. His father left home and doesnt contact him and his beloved cousin Kyle (Austin Stowell) has joined the Army. A dreamy kid Sawyer is falling behind in school.But after his chance encounter with the dolphin things change for Sawyer. He goes to the Clearwater Marine Hospital where the dolphin is kept and is fascinated by marine life there. Sawyer is befriended by a gregarious young girl named Hazel (Cozi Zuehlsdorff). Though her marine biologist dad (Harry Connick Jr.) is initially leery about allowing someone from outside to interact with the dolphin whom they name Winter he relents when he sees how deeply the dolphin is attached to Sawyer. Sawyer is quickly put to work at the hospital and begins to thrive.Gamble and Zuehlsdorff both engaging young actors hold their own among a cast of veterans.About the movieDolphin Tale   out of fourStars Harry Connick Jr. Ashley Judd Nathan Gamble Cozi Zuehlsdorff Austin Stowell Morgan FreemanDirector Charles Martin SmithDistributor Warner Bros. Rating PG for mild thematic elements Running time 1 hour 48 minutes Opens Friday nationwideThe dolphins life is complicated Scientists realize Winters tail is irrevocably damaged and must be surgically removed. When the resilient dolphin learns to swim without it the compensatory movements damage her spine. A solution must be found before Winter is paralyzed.In comes Morgan Freeman as a doctor who specializes in developing prosthetic limbs. In fact he outfitted Sawyers cousin who came back from his tour of duty badly injured. A prosthetic tail for Winter is developed and after a few unsuccessful tries is held in place by a soft sleeve.The film is based on a true story and the real Winter plays herself. At the films end its noted that visitors can go to see the dolphin at Clearwater (Fla.) Marine Aquarium.The same technology used to craft Winters prosthetic tail is now used to outfit children with artificial limbs. The closing credits are perhaps the most moving scenes featuring the real people involved in saving Winters life as well as scenes of happy children with prosthetic limbs visiting Winter.Freemans is the ideal voice to impart that theme ""Just because youre hurt doesnt mean youre broken.""

Comments click to enlarge Dolphin Tale Rated PG  119 minutes  2011 A troubled fatherless grade school boy (Nathan Gamble) helps rescue a beached female dolphin christened Winter by the veterinary team that amputates its infected tail and rehabilitates it at the marine hospital in Clearwater Florida. After the boys cousin returns home from war injured and requiring a leg brace the boy persuades a doctor at the local VA hospital (Morgan Freeman) to design a prosthetic tail for Winter. The parallel between the dolphin and the disabled tourists who flock to see it borders on treacle but Gambles rapport with his finned costar is so touching that the movie works anyway.

Picture Dolphin Tale review Intelligent family fare 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Dolphin Tale Family drama. Starring Nathan Gamble Ashley Judd Morgan Freeman and Harry Connick Jr. Directed by Charles Martin Smith. (PG. 113 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Theres something classy about ""Dolphin Tale"" which operates on the theory that children dont need a flatulence joke every five minutes to keep them from rioting in the theater aisles. Director Charles Martin Smith starred in the Disney nature drama ""Never Cry Wolf"" and was behind the camera for the first ""Air Bud"" and this charming story falls somewhere between the two. It gives young audiences credit for having patience and imagination and rewards them with an engaging narrative. Nathan Gamble is Sawyer a boy who doesnt fit in at school but finds his place at a Florida marine rescue center. He develops a connection with a dolphin named Winter whose tail is amputated then fights to save Winters life. Ashley Judd is Sawyers mother Harry Connick Jr. is the marine centers chief scientist and Kris Kristofferson is the grandfather figure. The fact that no one breaks into song is the only reason to ask for an admission refund. Theres enough woe in ""Dolphin Tale"" which is inspired by a true story for three movies. Between the euthanasia possibilities for Winter a hurricane a war accident and a hotel magnate who wants to close the center there isnt time for Sawyers single mom and the widowed science hunk to hook up. Related Stories Tale hooks viewers with well-told story Sweet ""Dolphin Tale"" doesnt water things down Review Dolphin Tale Dolphin Tale tells charming story doesnt pander But even with the conflict overkill most of the small moments ring true. ""Dolphin Tale"" has more in common with ""The Swiss Family Robinson"" than most modern live-action family movies where slapstick and cheap laughs feed short attention spans. A mischievous pelican shows up for comic relief but he doesnt overstay his welcome. The draw here is the fantasy of hanging out in a weathered old aquarium which is filled with hard lessons and wonderful surprises. And just when the movie seems to plateau Morgan Freeman shows up with a design for a prosthetic tail and all the best lines. E-mail Peter Hartlaub at phartlaubsfchronicle.com.

Credit Warner Brothers Pictures ""Dolphin Tale"" the story of a maimed dolphin named Winter and the people who rescue her is pitched awfully young without a shred of the satire or subtlety that is generally found in films aimed at tweeners and above. Thats not a bad thing; it just means accompanying grown-ups or older siblings will have to choke down a sizable dose of schmaltz with their fish milkshakes.The film is inspired by an actual dolphin rescue though it is so larded up with manufactured drama -- single-parent households a hurricane an animal rescue center facing bankruptcy a boy whose favorite cousin is in a war zone -- that its hard to tell whats real. The gist of it though is this Winter lost her tail after becoming entangled in a fishing net and her rescuers fitted her with a prosthetic one to help her survive.Nathan Gamble as the young rescuer in chief and Cozi Zuehlsdorff as the girl who befriends him make a decent enough kiddie couple and Harry Connick Jr. is quite watchable as the girls father who runs the rescue center. Everything including the parallels between the dolphin and the injured war veterans who factor into the story is made obvious enough that no 6-year-old could miss it. As for older viewers they have to wait to the very end for their rewards some glimpses of Winters real rescue and rehabilitation.""Dolphin Tale"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).

Artificial slope to open at Buck Hill this fall next Movies 130363573 Dolphin Tale is a real story well told When a boy encounters an injured dolphin his life takes a turn for the better.  |  1/2 out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune September 28 2011 -- 807pm Video (0834)  Dolphin Tale is a feel-good family movie worth seeing. Shari L. Gross Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Problem The roaring success of last weeks ""Lion King"" 3-D re-release underscored the scarcity of family-friendly films in the current marketplace. Solution ""Dolphin Tale"" a swell yarn about a boy and his bond with an injured bottlenose. Sometimes inspirational films have no craftsmanship to accompany their uplift. Not so here. Children dont have to apologize for taking their parents to this one. The cast is delightful the story corny without being cloyingly high-fructose the direction first-rate. Its awkward immature stumbles are few and even those are redeemed by the projects sunny sincerity. ""Dolphin Tale"" is inspired by the real-life story of Winter a south Florida dolphin who lost her tail to a crab trap. Sawyer (winningly played by wide-eyed Nathan Gamble) comforts the beached cetacean until the marine animal rescue unit can arrive creating a powerful bond of affection that runs both ways. The lonely middle-schooler begins cutting class to visit the aquarium where the handicapped dolphin is brought to recover. His mother (Ashley Judd) is incensed until she realizes that Sawyers attachment to Winter has turned her failing student into a responsible hardworking and studious young would-be marine biologist. Winters recuperation is fraught with setbacks but with the aid of a cantankerous prosthetics specialist (Morgan Freeman) Sawyer learns never to lose faith. The film has a warm web of human relationships as well with Cozi Zuehlsdorff as the aquariums resident preteen chatterbox; Harry Connick Jr. as her father the kindly but cash-strapped aquarium chief; and Kris Kristofferson as Connicks old-salt dad who is always good for straight talk and a crinkly smile. Charlie Martin Smith a longtime actor who starred in the outdoors classic ""Never Cry Wolf"" directs this film with a sure and steady hand. The sun-kissed Florida locations are attractive without being prettified. When the boy and his aquatic friend are threatened by a hurricane and the aquariums financial woes Smith milks the suspense but doesnt inflict undue anxiety. Warner Bros. Star Tribune Nathan Gamble in ""Dolphin Tale."" The film takes a sentimental turn concerning Sawyers cousin a swimming star injured in combat but never slides into sanctimony or schmaltz. Well not too deeply anyway. Freeman is a droll delight as the crotchety reconstructive engineer who tirelessly works on a mechanical tail for Winter complaining all the way. Playing herself Winter is a breakthrough star. For those who loathe saccharine kiddie movies but can still shed an honest tear at the story of a child and a beloved pet ""Dolphin Tale"" is a perfect fit. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

More about Dolphin Tale >> Tale is the story of a bionic Flipper who hurts her tail in a crab trap gets a prosthetic replacement and gives hope to others with disabilities. It may not be a great movie but it is an exceptionally touching one. The films main characters are a boy (Nathan Gamble) with a missing father and his cousin (Austin Stowell) a soldier with a missing appendage. Both of them see themselves in Winter (played by that frisky bottlenose herself) and find strength in how despite loss and disfigurement she energetically keeps on keeping on. Gamble is excellent as Sawyer a troubled 11-year-old detached from school family and life. When he encounters the injured dolphin he gets attached. Gambles vinegary performance cuts through the considerable schmaltz of a screenplay with so much incident that it truly does have everything but the bloodhounds snapping at Sawyers rear. Gamble previously played the grief-stricken son in Marley amp; Me. In emotional believability and skill he looks to be the next Josh Hutcherson a young actor who can act. Gambles laser-beam focus helps this diffuse movie find its theme - resilience - and its heart. Gambles adult costars - who include Morgan Freeman Ashley Judd Kris Kristofferson and Harry Connick Jr. - dont bring much to the game. But between the earnest boy his playful mammal the film from actor-turned-director Charles Martin Smith is a winning family entertainment.

Entangled in a crab trap Winter was brought in 2005 to the Clearwater Marine Hospital near Tampa where her flukes were amputated due to extensive tissue damage. A team of specialists worked up a prosthetic tail - some of their breakthroughs have been used in treating wounded Iraq War veterans - and Winter has since swum on to fame and inspirational news segments.""Dolphin Tale fictionalizes this story without doing any harm and the result is an excellent family film - maybe not up to 1996s ""Fly Away Home in the kid-helps-wildlife genre but eye-opening and heartwarming and sensibility-expanding all the same. Even the 3-D cinematography is above-average; neither a necessity nor a distraction.Nathan Gamble plays Sawyer a 12-year-old moping in the aftermath of his fathers abandonment and the departure of his beloved cousin (Austin Stowell) for Iraq. Present when the stranded dolphin is discovered the kid tags along to the marine hospital where hes befriended by Hazel (Cozi Zuehlsdorff) the spunky daughter of facility head Dr. Clay Haskett (Connick). The dolphin dubbed Winter responds to Sawyer and Mom (a likable Ashley Judd) comes around to his spending the summer there.In this telling its Sawyer who gets the idea to bring a folksy prosthetics expert (Morgan Freeman) in from the VA hospital where the cousins sulking around like Marlon Brando in ""The Men. Theres a hurricane to get past the facility is low on cash and a developer is hanging in the wings but director Charles Martin Smith treats these as temporary detours from the main order of business which is Winter and her recovery.The dolphin is quite simply remarkable and the unstated message of resilience and adaptation ripples easily off the screen to the smallest viewers. ""Dolphin Tale knows Winter is an irrepressible character but it rarely sentimentalizes her or her situation. Anyway theres too much work to be done to waste time with cutesy anthropomorphism. The film preserves the mystery of looking into an intelligent animals eye and recognizing an alien mind.At the same time its appreciative of what humans can do - of what a kid could do - to reach out to that mind.

"Dolphin Tale movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Dolphin Tale Humans and dolphins a heartwarming mix -- 2 1/2 starsSeptember 22 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticAshley Judd and Harry Connick Jr. star in ""Dolphin Tale.""Ill be honest in the spirit of the honestly shameless heartwarmer ""Dolphin Tale."" I saw it in a somewhat distracted agitated state.Forty-five seconds into the opening credits Im watching ocean-dwelling dolphins nosing around all sorts of potential dangers (a rusty fishing tackle box a fateful metal crab trap) and the films in 3-D so the dangers loom with exceptional emphasis and the pictures premise depends on putting the eventually tailless protagonist -- a real-life dolphin Winter played by Winter -- through all sorts of adversity alongside its human protectors.So Im thinking Maybe this isnt for me at this particular time.But ""Dolphin Tale"" turns out to tell an interestingly crowded story. Its rudimentary and even a little clumsy in its filmmaking technique (not a small matter) but theres some narrative ambition at least in its inventions built upon the real-life rescue of Winter who was no stranger to adversity and therefore destined for the movies.The adversities affecting the sea and/or land mammals includeDead or abandoning parents. Skillful young Nathan Gamble plays Sawyer a Clearwater Fla. 11-year-old whose father took off five years earlier. The boy has been in a funk ever since. Ashley Judd plays his mother exasperated at her sons grades worried about his well-being and initially wary of allowing him to spend time with the first real passion of his life. But she relents. The community young Sawyer finds at the cash-strapped Clearwater Marine Hospital is a warm and welcoming one. His new pal Hazel played by the sunny Cozi Zuehlsdorff is the motherless daughter of the hospital director portrayed by Harry Connick Jr.Disability. Just as Winter must be taught to swim with a prosthetic tail so too must Sawyers cousin Kyle (Austin Stowell) adjust to his bodys newfound limitations after being sent home from an Army deployment to Iraq with leg injuries.Director Charles Martin Smith who had the good fortune to star in one of the peak human/animal pictures of the last generation or two (""Never Cry Wolf"") handles a key scene well. A reunion between Kyle and Sawyer at the VA hospital reveals that Kyles in no shape to reintegrate with his family. The encounters difficulty is respected by both director and his actors. Later unfortunately theres a bit between Kyle and the doctor specializing in prosthetics (Morgan Freeman). Because the Morgan Freeman character is played by Morgan Freeman he is able to set Kyle straight and cure his psychological ills with just a bromide or two.Digital fakery. Smith working from the script by Karen Janszen and Noam Dromi deploys a fair amount of digital dolphin action more than I like as a moviegoer. Theres also strained comic-relief slapstick in a sequence involving Sawyer and Hazel flying badly a remote-controlled helicopter. Whatever. Kids electronic lives are crammed with so much second-rate action comedy another minute or two wont matter.The best of ""Dolphin Tale"" takes it easy. Led by Connick and Judd plus the crucially empathetic Gamble and Zuehlsdorff the cast includes Kris Kristofferson as the seafaring old salt of a grandpa. The acting has a nice low-pressure vibe in contrast to the films high-pressure peril. I havent mentioned the hurricane or the central financial question Can Winter and friends save the marine hospital from closing?

In 2005 just off the coast of Florida a young dolphin was rescued from a tangle of crab-fishing gear but her damaged tail had to be amputated. Touched by the plight of a crippled dolphin a maker of prosthetic limbs engineered a synthetic tail so the dolphin named Winter could again swim properly. She swims so well in fact that six years later she is playing herself in director Charles Martin Smiths movie. ""Sweet story"" some studio suit must have said. ""But can we get a lonely kid in there?"" Not only does this version of Winters experience include the classic saga of the needy child who blossoms in the company of a wild mammal; the filmmakers have also piled on some very contemporary angst. Dolphin Tale is more of a humans tale with interwoven subplots that include a young mans sacrifice in Iraq and a nonprofits struggle to say afloat in a recession. This last point is particularly relevant since it prompts the terrible words ""We have to start thinking about putting Winter down."" Dolphin Tale is crafted for demographic appeal to all four quadrants and maximum heartwarming. It doesnt look particularly special -- despite the visual potential of underwater scenes -- but kids are going to eat this up. Given what a dismal year its been for the family film its likely their parents will too. (See the top 10 heroic animals including Moko the dolphin.) The lonely boy is 11-year-old Sawyer Nelson (Nathan Gamble) who can build a cool model helicopter that flies but is stumped by academics. Hes on his way to summer school when he happens upon the traumatized dolphin on the beach. He cuts away some of the tangled lines using a pocketknife given to him by his idol his cousin Kyle (Austin Stowell) a former high school swimming champ just before he left for war. Sawyer and the beast share an intense moment in the sand -- its very Flipper meets From Here to Eternity. The dolphin ends up at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium ministered to by Dr. Clay (Harry Connick Jr.) and his young daughter Hazel (Cozi Zuehlsdorff). Having Connick bedside to take temperatures and play the saxophone would be enough to cheer up many mammals but Winter is partial to the troubled latchkey boy. Sawyers mom Lorraine (Ashley Judd) does something for work that involves long hours and scrubs but not a lot of money; Dad walked out on her five years earlier. (Is this what happened to Ruby in Paradise last seen in Florida in 1993?) The movie is not quite cheesy enough to reward widower Clay with poor abandoned Lorraine which is unfortunate because Judd hasnt had fun onscreen in years. Remember when she used to run around with Morgan Freeman playing brave and misunderstood women in jeopardy? Actually Freemans here too playing the good doctor who engineers Winters tail. So is Kris Kristofferson as Clays dad Reed a sailor who can quote John Masefields poem ""Sea Fever."" Freeman and Kristofferson mostly stand around gazing beatifically at the rest of the cast but they do it well enough to make the movie seem a little better than it is. None of the big names matter quite as much as the kid and the dolphin the hearts of the movie. Gamble doesnt have that scary perfection of the overtrained young actor; he seems genuinely winningly moody as if his director were having a hard time getting him to smile. (For a kick go back and watch Elijah Wood do a similar sulk in 1996s Flipper pre-Fellowship.) Gamble is no novice though -- he played the son of Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchetts characters in 2006s Babel. As for Winter she can thrash when needed and seems to eye the world with fear or curiosity or kindness depending on whats appropriate. I admit to being distracted from the importance of the quest to fit her with the perfect tail by thoughts of another ongoing dolphin tale. The Oscar-winning documentary The Cove told the story of the annual killing of thousands of dolphins in Japan those left over after trainers have selected from giant herded masses of dolphins potential Flipper types for amusement parks. While human beings can construct a tail for a creature with skin as smooth as silk no one can figure out how to halt the mass slaughter of her brethren across the globe. It doesnt make much sense. But this far prettier sweetened-for-consumption tale serves a purpose -- a little education a little entertainment and a message about the importance of finding a passion. Stay for the credits which feature footage of Winter in her pool at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium mingling with disabled humans who visit her for comfort and inspiration. Theres nothing contrived about those heartwarming scenes. Mary Pols MaryPols Mary Pols has been reviewing film and occasionally books for TIME since 2009.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The crowd-pleasing new interspecies buddy drama Dolphin Tale reunites Ashley Judd with Bug costar Harry Connick Jr. but animal-themed titles aside it would be difficult to imagine two more different films. Bug is a punishingly intense psychodrama; Dolphin Tale is as casual as a pleasant afternoon nap and about as substantive. For extra verisimilitude and heartwarming effect the film even stars Winter the dolphin whose tale it chronicles. Who could possibly hate a film built from such a disgustingly wholesome foundation? Dolphin Tale casts Nathan Gamble as a directionless boy who discovers his lifes calling when he finds a dolphin whose tail has become so infected that it must be amputated.  Since dolphins rely on their tails to swim the infection puts the dolphins life in danger until an eccentric prosthetics designer (Morgan Freeman) takes an interest in the case and decides to create the worlds first prosthetic dolphin tail. But can Gamble and kindly veterinarian Connick Jr. save Winter before the cash-strapped marine hospital that has become her sanctuary is closed by the real-estate developer who has bought the land on which it sits? Its always a treat seeing Morgan Freeman cast off the lofty righteousness that has become his signature. Here he delivers a delightful performance as a bowtie-sporting eccentric with an impish gleam in his eyes. Freeman is clearly enjoying himself but his mega-watt presence and some unnecessary 3D are just about the only things separating Dolphin Tale from an Animal Planet original movie. Actor-turned-director Charles Martin Smith gives the film the flat look of a TV movie and the broad-but-agreeable performances are all pitched firmly toward younger viewers. Dolphin Tale is unobjectionable to a fault a bland but cheery tribute to one spirited dolphin and the stubborn animal-lovers who refused to give up on her.

Posted September 26 2011 -- 1200 AM EDT A dolphin named Winter loses its tail to a crab trap in Dolphin Tale -- (sometimes sickly) sweet family film based on a true story. Its no spoiler to say that there is a happy ending partly because this is the kind of constantly uplifting heart-warmer in which even the villains are congenial but also because the injured animal is played by its real-life counterpart. Morgan Freeman also plays a version of himself as a kindly wise man whose expertise in prosthetics helps save Winter. While the plot occasionally feels like Free Willy without the drama its a cute story if you dont mind temporarily trading in your cynicism for a bag of popcorn.

Dolphin Tale Good Director Charles Martin Smith. Starring Nathan Gamble Morgan Freeman Ashley Judd Harry Connick Jr. Kris Kristofferson. Rating PG for mild thematic elements. This weeks new movie releases Spotlight Morgan Freeman Films with animal stars Of course attacking a film like this for being a tad cloying seems to be missing the point. Its an intrinsic part of what ""Dolphin Tale"" is. Its like getting mad at a dog for barking. The film centers on Sawyer (Nathan Gamble) a lonely 11-year-old boy who lacks friends and a father and is suffering through summer school. Things change when he finds an injured dolphin stranded on the beach and the two instantly bond. The real story of Winter The dolphin named Winter (and played by the real-life inspiration for the film) is taken to a rather ramshackle marine hospital to recover. The dolphins tail which was damaged by a crab trap must be amputated. That leads to Winter requiring a new tail otherwise shell face certain death. Despite being released in 3-D and featuring some rather flashy (if jarringly out-of-place) CGI sequences everything about ""Dolphin Tale"" is resolutely old-fashioned. The children are polite and well-behaved and theres no problem a little love and dedication cant fix. However it all works reasonably well thanks to the earnestness director Charles Martin Smith brings to the project. There isnt a cynical touch found anywhere in the film so its easy to buy in the good-natured world view presented. The movie is obviously geared toward youngsters though there may be some talky stretches that bore the very young. One example There is a long-winded subplot involving Sawyers cousin who comes home from Afghanistan with an injured leg. Adults will have a hard time swallowing the bit partially because of the obviousness of the situation and partially because actor Austin Stowell who plays the cousin is completely wooden. Smith has much better luck with the other actors. The adults who include Harry Connick Jr. Morgan Freeman Kris Kristofferson and Ashley Judd are all fine though they play second fiddle to the children who own the show. Cozi Zuehlsdorff winningly plays a young girl who works at the hospital. With her big smile and natural warmth she is a charmer. Even better is Gamble who gives a smart and sensitive performance without relying on any of the normal mannerisms that often afflict child actors. Gamble is such a pro that he even holds his own on screen with the dolphin. Thats something that the cast of ""Flipper"" couldnt accomplish in three years on TV.

"Movie Review ""Dolphin Tale"" | Movie Nation Movie Nation Filmgoing movie loving and a good argument. On a good day. Skip to content - Movie Review ""Killer Elite"" straight no-chaser Statham actioner Movie Review ""Senna"" - Movie Review ""Dolphin Tale"" Posted on January 7 2013      by rogerinorlando The story of how Winter a New Smyrna Beach dolphin lost her tail and became the star attraction of the Clearwater Aquarium becomes an adorable kids film in ""Dolphin Tale."" No this isnt how it really happened. But director Charles Martin Smith (""Air Bud"") wrings plenty of heartfelt tears and a few laughs out of this fictionalized account of how humans helped a dolphin survive a near-fatal injury and how that dolphin became an inspiration to others. Nathan Gamble stars as Sawyer an eleven year-old boy who helps a dolphin he and a fisherman find stranded on a beach her tail wrapped up in the ropes attached to a crab pot. Sawyer a social outcast who is struggling in school finds new purpose in saving this animal. Cozi Zuehlsdorff is Hazel the girl who comes with her marine veterinarian dad (Harry Connick Jr.) and a crew from the nearby marine hospital to pick up Winter as they call her and try to save her. Sawyer fibs to his mom (Ashley Judd) and plays hooky from school to stay with Winter who bonds with the boy who cut ropes from her tail a tail she eventually loses due to injuries. But as Sawyers wounded soldier-cousin returns home from combat to a Veterans Administration hospital full of men who are being fitted with artificial limbs the kid gets the idea to have a prosthetic specialist (Morgan Freeman) see what he can work out for the poor dolphin missing her tail. Freeman does his adorable curmudgeon thing. Kris Kristoffersen is Hazels crinkly-eyed grandpa who looks approvingly on all the life lessons the little dolphin is teaching his son and granddaughter and her new best friend. ""Dolphin Tale"" is movie of cute scenes and cuter ingredients -- the cranky pelican who rules the roost at the aquarium the way Hazel and her dad live on a houseboat that looks like a Disney World castaways attraction for instance. The melodrama kicks in as the marine hospital and aquarium are struggling to stay afloat battered by a hurricane coveted by a hotel developer (Winter Park actor Tom Nowicki in a nice turn). Yes it was ""inspired by a true story."" The ""Hollywood version"" of this tale of rescue and rehabilitation tugs on the heartstrings and leans on ""Free Willy"" for inspiration. But the process of fictionalizing Winters story makes it kid-friendlier and neatly ties the dolphin with the prosthetic tail to those veterans and others with prosthetic limbs she has come to inspire. And youd have to be a little stone-hearted to not be moved by the message tacked on here one line beautifully delivered by Freeman. ""Just because youre hurt doesnt mean youre broken."" MPAA Rating PG for some mild thematic elements. Cast Harry Connick Jr. Morgan Freeman Ashley Judd Frances Sternhagen Tom Nowkicki Credits Directed by Charles Martin Smith written by Karen Janszen and Noam Dromi. A Warner Brothers release.

Three things that make everybody happy Christmas ice cream and dolphins. A delightful new family film called Dolphin Tale is not a Christmas story; it takes place in Florida so you wouldnt know it even if it was. But you get everything else and the way things are going at the movies these days two out of three aint bad. This is the kind of movie with end credits for days postproduction edits for years and nobody cares. What matters is how lovable the dolphin is and on that score everyone can rest easy. The star of this unbelievably heroic true story is a real-life female dolphin named Winter who while swimming off the Florida coast as a baby six years ago got trapped in a lobster cage and washed to shore tied in fishermen ropes her tail fin severely damaged and unable to move. Near death and struggling to breathe she was discovered on the beach by a shy lonely 11-year-old boy named Sawyer Nelson then rescued and transported by ambulance to the Clearwater Marine Hospital and Aquarium by a dedicated veteran marine biologist Dr. Clay Haskett (Harry Connick Jr.) who spent years trying to teach the injured dolphin how to swim again. Sadly Winter eventually lost the fight and her tail was amputated. But her story was just beginning. The movie chronicles the struggles of a valiant animal who wouldnt give up and the people who became her family in the fight for survival. The greatest miracle of all is the meticulous research and painstaking laboratory testing by a brilliant prosthetics inventor Dr. Cameron McCarthy (Morgan Freeman) that eventually led to Winters recovery. The revolutionary tail that acts as a rudder is a custom-fitted silicon gel sleeve that now serves as a model for physically challenged humans and marine life throughout the world. The names have been changed and some of the situations invented to make a more emotionally satisfying movie but the facts are well documented and Winter is still swimming up a storm with her new tail in Clearwater where she is a big tourist attraction a symbol of courage and determination for millions and an inspiration for disabled men women children and fish alike. Winters rehab is long and arduous but she never forgets Sawyer the boy who freed her (played by Nathan Gamble) or his new friend Hazel (Cozi Zuehlsdorff) who lives on a houseboat with her father (Connick) and grandfather (Kris Kristofferson). The two kids in the movie who bond through their passion for dolphins are excellent as are the adults including Ashley Judd as Sawyers mother and Frances Sternhagen as the board member who fights to save the marine hospital from being closed by the state and sold to a hotel developer. After a hurricane so much property is destroyed that homes are found for all of the animals except Winter and the decision is made to put the dolphin down. Its the children who come up with a plan to save their beloved friend and the hospital too by launching their own website and selling tickets to see the miracle dolphin in action on the Internet. Everyone is transported and transformed including Sawyers cousin a former swimming champ who has lost the use of one leg in the U.S. Army. The movie often seems too good to be true but by the end I wanted a dolphin just like Winter for my own swimming pool. The director is Charles Martin Smith best known as the actor who worked with wolves in the 1983 film Never Cry Wolf. Hes also directed horror films but clearly he works better with animals than people. Anyone fascinated with the phenomenon of how dolphins rank second only to golden retrievers in their boundless ability to bond with humans will be bowled over by this movie. I saw it in a Sunday afternoon preview with an audience of children who were quiet mesmerized and completely enraptured. No wonder. As the first dolphin in history who has ever survived without a tail Winter is friendly loving emotional playful brave and intelligent. Before her Dolphin Tale is over I dare even the most jaded cynic not to shed a tear of admiration and joy. rreedobserver.com DOLPHIN TALE Running Time 113 minutes Written by Karen Janszen and Noam Dromi Directed by Charles Martin Smith Starring Morgan Freeman Ashley Judd and Harry Connick Jr. 3/4 Comment Filed under Ashley Judd Dolphin Harry Connick Jr. Morgan Freeman movie Movie Review Nature Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture The Man Who Made Blue Oyster Cult RIP Producer Sandy Pearlman Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP,http://www.observer.com/2011/09/dolphin-tale-is-a-fishy-tale/,200,dolphintale24,dolphintale,observer

Off the Florida coast skittish grade-schooler Nelson (Nathan Gamble) strikes an immediate bond with a bottlenose named Winter (playing herself) freeing her from a crab trap that has irrevocably crippled her tail. Son of a cool single mom (Ashley Judd) Nelson is a dispassionate loner whose only father figure is his older cousin a former swimming champion who returns home from overseas military deployment wheelchair-bound and traumatized in a surprisingly weighty and grown-up subplot. But the kid finds new purpose in helping out with Winters rehabilitation at the local marine hospital led by Harry Connick Jr.s good-hearted doc and his spunky freckled daughter (Cozi Zuehlsdorff). A mildly eccentric prosthetics doctor (MVP Morgan Freeman) is eventually called upon to craft a new flipper for Flipper and a third-act ""Save the Dolphins from Condo Developers"" carnival dribbles out the rest of the formula. But the message is too pure to nitpick By the end of the movie Winter has become a mascot for human disability especially for children and Dolphin Tale has enough depth and sensitivity to tap into emotion without feeling manipulative.

Drenchingly inspirational aquatic tale should play well with general audiences and kids. TWITTER This true story of a dolphin with a prosthetic tail has been precision engineered for full inspirational heart-warming value. The notion that behind every setback in life lies a potential rainbow is laid on a bit thick in Dolphin Tale an appealing family film that doesnt know when to quit with the uplift. In telling the true story of a dolphin whose damaged tail is eventually replaced by a prosthetic one (the actual dolphin it happened to plays herself) not a scene goes by that hasnt been precision engineered for its full inspirational heart-warming value which equates with some peoples concern about what heaven could be like The sheer goodness of it all might be too much to bear. This follow-up by Alcon Entertainment to its smash The Blind Side shares that films focus on positive well-purposed people doing the right thing and helping others out. As such it will likely be embraced by a portion of the same public albeit with the kids in tow. Like many of the best animal films this one is not so much about the critter in question as about the kids who love it. Dolphin Tale comes up aces in this department with Sawyer (Nathan Gamble) a good-looking freckled 11-year-old whos been in an unrelieved funk since his father took off; his mother Lorraine (Ashley Judd) couldnt be nicer but Sawyer is failing in school has no friends and spends every second he can toying with stuff in his dads abandoned workshop. But his life changes when he discovers a beached dolphin near his Clearwater Florida home. Experts from the local marine hospital untangle it from a web of ropes before taking it to the facility for treaatment but its tail has been badly damaged by a large crab trap. Sneaking into the inviting clinic/aquarium Sawyer becomes obsessed by the fate of the dolphin named Winter which seems to respond especially well to the boys attentions. Sawyer is quickly embraced by the hospitals staff led by Dr. Clay Haskett (Harry Connick Jr.) whose cloyingly rambunctious daughter Hazel (Cozi Zuehlsdorff) is not only roughly Sawyers age but doesnt have a mom. Also on board literally is Kris Kristofferson as Clays old salt dad. Aside from some overdone comic relief involving a cackling pelican this early stretch is the best in the film as it sensitively depicts a withdrawn boys emergence from his shell; Sawyer awakens to life his own potential and another beings survival. Its a process Gambles talents make palpable and intermittently touching. After Winter is left with a stumpy rear after her tail is amputated the doctor insists she needs a prosthetic addition to facilitate a dolphins normal up-and-down propulsion movement. A genial cant-say-no doctor at the nearby V.A. hospital (Morgan Freeman) obligingly signs on to design one but Winter rejects the initial prototype. Then theres a hurricane the destruction from which puts the hospital in such debt itll have to be sold. And theres a subplot about Sawyers cousin Kyle (Austin Stowell) a hunky local swimming champ who no sooner joins the army than he comes back with a debilitating injury that makes him inconsolable. The dolphin with her own disability inspires him to shape up. As agreeably made as it is by director Charles Martin Smith who spent a lot of screen time with animals in Carroll Ballards Never Cry Wolf and was behind the camera on the dog-centric Air Bud the film doesnt know when to quit. When it looks as though the Clearwater Marine Hospital is doomed at the snap of a finger those concerned are able to generate TV coverage and stage a huge aquatic benefit to try to save the day. Kyle gets back in the water competitively. A billionaire real estate developer turns out to have the soul of Santa Claus. Winter gets a new tail supported by a newly invented sleeve that as illustrated in extensive climactic docu/video footage has evidently gone on to greatly benefit the handicapped and injured. The only set-up that doesnt play out like a Hollywood fairytale involves Sawyers mom and Hazels dad getting together but perhaps that can wait for the sequel. Ballards influence echoes through the project not only through Smith but through the script written by his Duma scenarist Karen Janszen along with Noam Dromi. The opening CGI shots of dolphins swimming in the ocean create fears of undue fakery that fortunately prove unfounded. Performances are all on the sincere side with a stress on emotional positivism. The film will be released in 2D and 3D versions with the former caught for review.

Though garnished with some heavy dollops of cheese ""Dolphin Tale"" is a surprisingly solid earnest family pic based very loosely on the story of Winter the first dolphin to be successfully fitted with a prosthetic tail. While the film piles on various backstories and morals a bit haphazardly parents will surely applaud its underlying message of adolescent empowerment and the far better than average cast gives this one a strong emotional undercurrent. Pic should perform well at the B.O. with even better returns on homevid. As protagonist Sawyer a fictional fatherless 11-year-old young thesp Nathan Gamble (""Babel"" ""The Dark Knight"") ably carries the Florida-set film. A mechanical whiz kid Sawyer nonetheless struggles through a remedial summer school class has no friends and is so unsociable he can hardly bother to look up from his Nintendo DS at a going-away party for his soldier cousin (Austin Stowell) headed off to serve in Afghanistan. His zombie-like trudge to school the next day is interrupted by an encounter with a beached dolphin tangled in a crab trap. Fascinated by the crack task force of marine biologists who show up to rescue her Sawyer skips school to sneak out to the nearby marine hospital where the aquariums home-schooled young gopher Hazel (Cozi Zuehlsdorff) takes an immediate liking to him. The creaky-yet-homey aquarium is run by Hazels father Clay (Harry Connick Jr.) who lives on a nearby houseboat with his own father Reed (Kris Kristofferson). All three generations of this family serve as inexhaustible fonts of some rather hackneyed homespun wisdom but with actors as appealing as these (young debutante Zuehlsdorff holds her own with the elder two nicely) it all goes down rather easy. The injuries to the dolphin (now dubbed Winter) necessitate amputation of her tail which in the wild would mean almost certain death. With Sawyer gradually dropping out of summer school and hanging around the aquarium full time Winter eventually develops an odd new swimming technique swinging her tail-stub from side to side. This creates problems of its own however and Sawyer recruits a prosthetics expert from a VA hospital (Morgan Freeman) to construct a synthetic tail all while the marine hospital faces closure. The central notion here is one parents will appreciate as Sawyer comes to learn the importance of education and engagement with the world in his own way. The film limns this lesson with subtlety and Gambles strong performance helps give the film a genuine character arc where there otherwise could have simply been a heavy-handed moral. (Other strands -- especially one involving Sawyers cousin -- come off a bit more forced though the filmmakers are still to be commended for tackling such topics as disability and debt with unusual frankness.) Aside from two gimmicky CGI sequences clearly intended for 3D (and rather cartoonish-looking without it) the pic is smartly constructed and trusts its young audience to pay attention through long spells without any superfluous slapstick or one-liners (a sadly rare quality in contemporary family pics). Animal wranglers put in terrific work with the central creature (portrayed by the actual dolphin the pic is based upon) and location scouting in Clearwater Fla. provides for some believable scenery.
