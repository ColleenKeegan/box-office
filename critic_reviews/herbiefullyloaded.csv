Thirty seven years on very little has changed this modern mutation (also by Disney) joins the same conventional dots as the original and follows a similar child-friendly premise. Herbie for the uninitiated is a classic VW Beetle with a mind of its own. In true underdog style the free-thinking four-fendered motor is rescued from the scrapyard by the daughter of a race team manager tuned up and in the final reel entered into the national Nascar championship race meeting where... No sense in divulging the predictable outcome suffice it to say that the film mines every cliche in the book and then some. As a one-time Herbie fan I must admit feeling a tinge of nostalgia on seeing the little fella again. What I didnt expect was the resounding yes from the kids in the audience who clearly loved the films boisterous slapstick humour and generally easy-going nature. A bit of a hit then.

And for those newbies this update starring peppery Disney re-do queen Lindsay Lohan as wannabe car racer Maggie Peyton is as serviceable an introduction as any to the notion of a sentient set of wheels. Among the clues that this is not your fathers Volkswagen Maggies a college graduate with career options that include a gig at ESPN; and Herbie has the hots for a snazzy late-model yellow VW Beetle the sight of which makes his radio antenna extend.

"Herbie Nothing But Scrap Metal washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Herbie Nothing But Scrap Metal Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 24 2005 This ""Herbie"" -- a sequel to the ""Love Bug"" movies of the 1960s and 1970s about an anthropomorphic Volkswagen that thinks its a race car -- is loaded all right. Unfortunately its with spare parts from dozens of other equally mediocre underdog sports films. The good news and there is some is that its target audience members (say 5- to 6-year-olds) havent lived long enough to have seen any of them. For anyone old enough to cross the street without holding hands however the movies a reconditioned lemon trying hard to hide its flaws. They are in no particular order of egregiousness lame dialogue (credited to four people you never heard of); acting by stars Lindsay Lohan Michael Keaton and Matt Dillon that if not exactly wooden at least smells of Old English furniture polish; styleless direction by Angela (""D.E.B.S."") Robinson; cheesy effects; a music score phoned in by Mark Mothersbaugh whose work on ""Rugrats"" puts this to shame; and a supplementary oldies soundtrack so lazy it seems to have been cadged from a K-Tel Records collection. The plot (which at 101 minutes is about 30 minutes too long) concerns the discovery in a junk yard of a beat-up old VW named Herbie whose past exploits as an unlikely racing champion are introduced in a retro-looking opening-credit sequence. Rescued from the crusher by Maggie Peyton (Lohan) the scion of a down-on-his-luck stock car racing team captain (Keaton) Herbie proves himself still capable of a little fight when he trounces cocky pro racer Trip Murphy (Dillon) in a street race leading to higher and higher-stake showdowns. Stalling the inevitable conclusion are a couple of complications Maggies dad doesnt want her to drive even though its in her blood and Herbie almost bites the dust in a demolition derby after Maggie loses him to Trip in an ill-considered wager. Other than that this race is fixed from start to finish with the sure losers being all the parents whose kids will drag them to see this hunk of junk held together by cliches and Turtle Wax. Herbie Fully Loaded (G 101 minutes) -- Contains the barest smidgen of mildly crude humor. Area theaters.

Starring Lindsay Lohan Michael Keaton Matt Dillon andBreckin Meyer. Directed by Angela Robinson. (Rated G 101 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) With ""Mean Girls"" sex kitten Lindsay Lohan in the starring role and a title thats one action verb away from a porn movie ""Herbie Fully Loaded"" is a Disney film in disguise. But the first few minutes -- with a clever flashback credit sequence and not-so-clever scenes of the Volkswagen Bug squirting oil on the owner of a wrecking yard -- quickly set the tone This movie is old-school Disney from the Fred MacMurray years with upstanding moral young people villains who are more bumbling than scary and the only sexual innuendos coming between two automobiles. ""Herbie Fully Loaded"" would be a modern-day ""Gus"" if it only had a field goal-kicking mule and a little more heart. Instead the comedy is pleasant for a while and its a totally harmless movie for kids but it runs mostly on a high-octane mix of slapstick comedy and special effects -- with little for discriminating moviegoers to enjoy. Lohan is Maggie Peyton the daughter in a stock car racing family that has no problem with her choice of midriff-revealing attire but doesnt want her anywhere near the world of competitive racing. Down-on-his-luck parent Ray Peyton Sr. (Michael Keaton who may have a future in these Paul Dooley/""Sixteen Candles"" father figure roles) lets his college graduate daughter pick any car out of a junkyard and in a marginally amusing scene Herbie basically picks her. The movie is a sequel of sorts although its hard to remember so much product placement in the original 1968 Herbie movie ""The Love Bug."" The new Herbie also seems a bit more like Stephen Kings ""Christine"" than the original -- with a mean streak that isnt always forgiven when he flutters his headlights and his front bumper turns into a grin. Disney does provide some decent set pieces unleashing Herbie in a drag race for ""pinks"" a demolition derby and a rousing but too-short NASCAR race. But the filmmaking is clumsy at times with awkward shifts in tone and supporting characters that are either completely undeveloped or irrationally evil. And the final scene steals so much from ""Breaking Away"" youll expect Dennis Quaid and Jackie Earle Haley to take turns behind the wheel. Matt Dillon as bad guy NASCAR driver Trip Murphy (the worst NASCAR movie driver name since Tom Cruise played ""Cole Trickle"" in ""Days of Thunder"") has been reduced to a Scooby-Doo villain. There are five writers attached to the credits and they still force the ""Crash"" star to recite such lines as ""You better get this car back to the circus before Bozo puts out an APB."" The plot also includes two montages where Herbie is fixed up and multiple commercialized scenes that revolve around new Volkswagen vehicles -- including a shot where Herbies antenna appears to be used to display his sexual arousal. Thankfully for parents who plan to shepherd their kids to this film Herbies the only one getting any. Lohan doesnt show much more than that midriff and her romance with nice guy Kevin (Justin Long) doesnt go any further than first base. Its a kids movie from a better time with a few small concessions to modern audiences. And with a winning formula like that can ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang Fully Loaded"" and ""The Apple Dumpling Gang Fully Loaded"" be far behind? -- Advisory This film contains car-on-car violence and sexual innuendos involving automobiles. Lindsay Lohans bare midriff is on display for about 56 percent of the movie.

""Herbie Fully Loaded"" proves that a movie about a souped-up Volkswagen Beetle with the engine of a rebel and a will of its own can still be a pedestrian outing. An update of the 1969 Disney family flick ""The Love Bug"" (and its many incarnations) ""Herbie Fully Loaded"" uses a fanciful opening credit sequence to provide the back story of No. 53 for a new generation of moviegoers. Clips from the earlier films show Herbies underdog triumphs his love story and the waning of a bugs life on the race circuit. Buoyed by a soundtrack that captures a retro endless-summer vibe this montage turns out to be the best filmmaking in ""Herbie."" Its not that ""Fully Loaded"" doesnt have heartfelt ambitions. Directed by relative newcomer Angela Robinson it does. Only that once the filmmakers decided on the contemporary moral of a daughter becoming her familys last best hope they deliver the tale with devices you can recognize a mile from the checkered flag. Lindsay Lohan stars as Maggie Peyton overlooked heir in a stock-car racing dynasty headed for its last days behind the wheel. Although Maggies dad Ray Sr. (Michael Keaton) insists her brother Ray Jr. (Breckin Meyer) doesnt have the need for speed necessary to keep the legendary family going. With one exception sponsors are pulling their support. No small matter because is any sport as tattooed with brand names as NASCAR? As the movie opens Maggie is graduating from college. At summers end shell head to the a reputable gig at ESPN in New York City. The one-time street racer remains a bit of a rebel. She makes her entrance riding a skateboard and wearing a miniskirt beneath her graduation gown. In a world in which stars routinely do minor stunts its more than cheesy that Lohan seems to have a skate double doing what are basic maneuvers. So much for the girl power. The star does however wear her own miniskirt. When Maggies closest friend drives up in a new SUV - a graduation present - we learn that the Peytons family fortunes are quite different. Ray Sr. takes the grad to a salvage yard for her present. There Maggie finds Herbie thanks to some desperate interventions of the battered humbled car. An old friend Kevin (Justin Long) helps Maggie retool the junker which already has revealed its personality to Maggie by taking her for some unsettling spins. Maggie the real speed demon of the family takes a while to accept her fate. But in due time shes lying to her Dad and racing again. A daughter who bonds with a misfit a widower dad whos overly protective of his daughter a climax that leads inevitably to the daughter teaching the father whats possible ""Fully Loaded"" is a lot like the more entertaining family film ""Racing Stripes"" which opened earlier this year. But then a talking zebra trumps a winking car any day of the week no matter how cute the vehicle. Matt Dillon who can be seen revving up his career as a biased cop in ""Crash"" looks to be enjoying his role as Maggies nemesis Trip Murphy. A smug NASCAR racer he strides around chomping gum grinning and uttering sentences like ""Hope you dont mind that I crashed your party."" Later he tells Maggie ""You can take the car out of the junkyard but you cant take the junkyard out of the car."" Its understandable if that kind of rote dialog makes you wince for the G-rated set. They deserve better. Yet with ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" appearing on Broadway and Samantha and Darren ready for a reprise when ""Bewitched"" lands in multiplexes Friday its easy to see which generations pop-cultural memories are being reheated and served. Think of it as our own pop-culture comfort food the makers are hoping well dish up to our kids.

Family fare Lindsay Lohans Maggie shares her love of racing with her dad played by Michael Keaton. Disney Though not much of a movie Loaded probably will bring fleeting satisfaction to audiences who dont know Dean Jones (who played Herbies straight guy on Love Bug) from Spike Jones. Prominent among these will be very young children who will enjoy seeing a Volkswagen Beetle skidding and flipping on race tracks and streets without bursting into flames. (Related video Watch the Herbie Fully Loaded trailer) But dont rule out Loadeds mild appeal to older boys who are smitten with lead Lindsay Lohan who even if she were wearing a suit of armor would find a way to bare a couple inches of midriff in most of her scenes. The final audience target would be ""the Ghost of Earl Scheib"" because junkyard Herbie wouldnt be Herbie if he didnt need a paint job. A Bug with attitude -- his headlights have blinking eyelids and he takes insults personally -- Herbie has supernatural skills that sometimes obscure the fact that hes a cosmetic mess until he gets a new engine and a few fresh coats. Lohan who recently received her own physical tune-up is seen here in now-retro buxom-redhead mode. She plays a recent college grad who is about to travel 3000 miles for an ESPN job (uh-huh) when what she really wants to do is race. The dad who says no is played by Michael Keaton an actor who once had as much attitude as Herbie. So its distressing seeing him play a bland U.S. president in Katie Holmes First Daughter and now high-fiving as he watches a race and emits a Marv Albert-like ""Yes"" At least Matt Dillon (a long way from Drugstore Cowboy) amuses as Lohans egocentric racing rival slumming though he is. Though The Parent Trap and Freaky Friday were better Disney remakes youll get what you expect here including a 70 tab if you take a brood and everyone has to load up on Sno-Caps and Dots. Loaded does not address the fact that a car with superpowers in an auto race is a lot like a home run hitter who takes steroids. Herbie is the new Jose Canseco. (Opens nationwide Wednesday.

"Herbie Fully Loaded Old Engine in a New Body washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Herbie Fully Loaded Old Engine in a New Body Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday June 22 2005 In 1968 Volkswagen Beetles were cute. Astonishments of miniaturized engineering they seemed to counter everything that Detroit iron with its aggressive lines gigantic high-octane furnaces and throaty stinky yowls stood for. Little Deuce Coupes and GTOs ruled standing for Detroits hegemony and the United States as well; ""Bugs"" were the countercultures rebuke to that rule. The peoples wagon stood for people not men; it stood for love not power; it stood for peace not war. Nearly every baby boomer has one in his past; it was a way of joining the crusade. Now uh-uh. Its just another car. Thats just one of the reasons ""Herbie Fully Loaded"" doesnt begin to work. The icon around which it was built has no meaning anymore. You look at it and think So? It helps even less that the special effects so vivid in 1968s ""The Love Bug"" where Herbie was invented now seem hopelessly outdated. Back then when Disney got a car to wink it was pretty freakin far out It was cuter than cute. Now in an age of CGI where cityscapes and sentient beings and armies routinely come to life where irises dilate and gossamer water spumes refract in the sunlight seeing a metal lid close over a headlamp is pretty tame stuff. As a movie illusion the little car remains essentially unexpressive even when its winking at Jeff Gordon. Who knew Herbie was gay not that it matters. Anyhow poor Gordon is in ""Herbie Fully Loaded"" as part of the movies other salient and repulsive aspect the sellout of NASCAR by NASCAR for any damn thing. Heres a movie that postulates a typical stock car race can be won by not merely a rookie professional driver but an amateur who moreover beats dozens of highly skilled professional hero-athletes who are risking not merely loss or humiliation but their lives as they rush for the checkered flag. And she does it without breaking a sweat. The racing organization cant have it both ways can it? NASCAR it tells one audience is a cutthroat arena of grits and guts where only the strong and fearless survive. Bite off and chew a plug of that pardner But here by its cooperation with the Disney factory NASCAR says its also warm n cuddly and that if you love your magic bug itll repay you with victory. Why does it allow itself to be co-opted by a story that diminishes the skills experience and talent it takes to win? Those issues aside the movie that remains is at once mild and weird; it lacks the energy that director Angela Robinson brought to her breakout film ""D.E.B.S."" and instead has a big-studio stamped-and-milled feeling to it. ""Herbie Fully Loaded"" is set in an almost sexless world and its view of young people and young behavior fits in completely with the original ""Love Bug"" -- its kind of pre-sexual-revolution. Then strangely it stops at one point to sexualize Lindsay Lohan its pretty almost personality-free star by suddenly shoving her into high heels and a kilt that comes to a stop somewhere not far enough south to reach the equator. Thats a lotta leg on view primed to erotic tension by the arch angle induced by the patent-leather heels particularly as they harden her calves. (Kids Im a highly trained professional and I get paid to notice this sort of thing; dont try this at home.) Generically I suppose ""Herbie Fully Loaded"" decodes into a girlpower essay feeble in its reach unconvincing in its execution cute in its tone endless in its unspooling. Lohan plays Maggie Peyton a young woman with racing in her blood as her dad (the underused Michael Keaton) is a former champ. But hes putting all his money behind his sons racing career whereas shes the one who inherited the reflexes and the will to race. But as a college graduation gift Ray lets her buy a 75 junker in an auto graveyard and as fate would have it thats where famous No. 53 which got Dean Jones in multiple winners circles back in the 60s has gone to die. But Herbie is the Beetle too tough for extinction and having a will of his own forces the young woman to choose him then reveals his genius for racing in cute ways. The movie is set up to spotlight infantile dramatizations of real-world problems then not acknowledge them The Peyton clan is completely dysfunctional but the movie addresses this only by indirection; Papa Ray is one of those hidebound traditionalists who thinks he can insist that his daughter be a certain thing as opposed to letting her be what her nature demands. But hes not the villain. That role goes to another absurd conceit a NASCAR champ named Trip Murphy (Matt Dillon) who beaten in a pickup race by Herbie with Maggie hanging on for dear life conceives a vendetta against the car and the young woman. The sexual innuendo here -- handsome older man extremely seductive younger woman relationship full of hostility and intimidation -- is all the more powerful for the movies utter inability to face it. Im thinking Why dont they just get a room? Frankly theres a lot more heat between these two separated by taboo and tradition than between Lohan and her nominal if puppy-like love interest played by the unexceptional Justin Long. Of course all plot strains pull us toward the Big Race where Maggie astride Herbie must race for all the dough against the evil Trip. Any doubts about the outcome? If so youd best quit reading now because Im about to give it away. You have to say This is not right. The glory of sports is that anyone can beat anyone. A Jim Braddock can beat a Max Baer and a Max Schmeling can beat a Joe Lewis. Boston can run four straight on the Yankees. Harvard can beat Yale 29 to 29. The Cobden Appleknockers can beat Carver. Oh wait no Carver won that one. Anyhow what makes sports real to people is the process by which on a given day the little guy can get lucky find some heroism find some guts and unbelievably win. And when that happens -- ever so rarely -- its almost transcendental. In this movie the win comes because Herbie is magic. So whats the big deal in that? Whats the accomplishment? Wheres the heroism the skill the grit? Its not that Maggie is a good driver or that she has more guts than the vile Trip Murphy its that Herbie via film trickery can do things no car in history can do such as go sideways -- how lame is that? -- on the cyclone fence so that his 180-horsepower engine can get by Trip with his 800 horses. Its just . . . ridiculous. Nobodys going to believe it. Nobody should have to. Herbie Fully Loaded (101 minutes at area theaters) is rated G despite sexual innuendo.

"Herbie Fully Loaded | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; herbie-fully-loaded ) Herbie Fully Loaded (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Herbie the car that wont die. I suppose there are worse ways to spend a summer evening than in the company of this cast and the R2D2-like automobile but hasnt the day of Herbie come and gone? The Love Bug first made its appearance in the 1968 film Herbie the Love Bug a low-budget low-concept Disney film starring Dean Jones. When the movie struck box office gold a sequel was born although it took that movie Herbie Rides Again six years to reach theaters. 1977 and 1980 saw two more Herbie movies then there was a short-lived TV series in 1982. Still not dead the VW with more lives than a cat returned for a 1997 TV movie. Now eight years later Disney has dusted off the car once more and paired it with pre-teen draw Lindsay Lohan for a film thats as much a remake as it is a continuation of the ""legend."" (Casting note Dean Jones who appeared in all of the previous incarnations of Herbie except Herbie Rides Again is nowhere to be found in this movie. It would have been a classy move to give him a cameo although Im not sure how many members of the audience would have recognized him.) The story is straightforward as one would expect from a movie aimed at the pre-puberty crowd. Its part girl-power inspiration and part sports movie and anyone who doesnt know beforehand how The Big Race is going to turn out should be ashamed of himself or herself. Thats one annoying thing about films like this that close with obligatory closing games/races/matches/etc. a theres no suspense. Its anti-climactic since we know what the result has to be. Theres no mystery and only the most skilled director can invest this event with energy. Angela Robinson is not up to the task. The lengthy Nextel Championship NASCAR race that represents Herbie Fully Loadeds final lap is plodding. Its duller than watching a crash-free car race on television. During the opening credits we are given a brief recap of the rise and fall of Herbie over the years. The story picks up with the bugs arrival at Crazy Daves Scrap and Salvage where the crusher awaits. However just as Herbie is about to be pancaked it catches the attention of Maggie Peyton (Lindsay Lohan) who buys the car for 75. This represents a graduation present from her father Ray (Michael Keaton) who proudly announces that his daughter is the first one in the family to earn a college diploma But the Peytons have racing in their blood (Ray and his father were famous drivers and Maggies brother is trying to qualify for The Big Race) and Maggie is no exception. Since being injured in a crash several years ago Maggie has avoided getting behind the wheel. But when she meets Herbie things change. The VW has a mind of its own and it forces Maggie to challenge top NASCAR driver Trip Murphy (Matt Dillon) to a street race. When Herbie and Maggie win Trip becomes determined to arrange a re-match and claim victory at all costs. Meanwhile Maggie must lie to Ray about racing again since her father has forbidden her to become involved in any kind of competitive driving. Herbie Fully Loaded is about the relationship between Maggie and her dad (a girl finding her own way and earning her fathers respect in the process) and about the relationship between a girl and her best friend which happens to be a car. Theres also a little romance thrown in with Justin Long playing Maggies love interest but this is insubstantial enough to be disregarded. (And considering that the writers are worse than George Lucas at conceiving a love story ignoring it is the best approach.) Its a classic underdog overcomes story with Maggie and Herbie functioning as the unlikeliest of champions. Together they find victory while apart they face defeat. Theres nothing new to be found here although director Robinsons approach is workmanlike (if not inspired). The movie is pleasant but unspectacular and at times it borders on being too cute. The car is the source of most of the laughs as it winks its headlights smiles using its front bumper and uses its trunk to conk meddlers on the head. Theres an amusing ""love scene"" in which Herbie notices a newer sexy VW. The windshield fogs up and the antenna snaps to attention. This is one of the few instances in which the movie throws in a moment for the grown-ups. As bright a starlet as she may be Lohan ends up playing second fiddle to the car. The actress was more of a standout in Mean Girls but its tough to call this a step back because the screenplay doesnt give her a lot to work with. This isnt a challenging role and she does as much with it as any actress her age could. Internet rumors indicate that the CGI artists at Disney digitally reduced her breast size to prevent her assets from becoming ""a distraction."" Either this is untrue it was done sparingly or ""ample"" would be an understated description. Meanwhile Michael Keaton sleepwalks through a performance that doesnt require more than that he look fatherly. Matt Dillon invests his bad guy with some energy but its still a throwaway part. Breckin Meyer (playing Maggies brother) and Justin Long are forgettable. As family films go Herbie Fully Loaded is adequate fare. Children will probably enjoy it and most parents will be able to tolerate it. Its a breezy affair that doesnt overstay its welcome and there are plenty of 80s songs on the lively soundtrack. I suppose Herbie has some nostalgic appeal but the main draw will be to a new generation. It remains to be seen whether Herbie Fully Loaded gives the car another lease on life or finally sends it to the cinematic junkyard.

Lindsay Lohan continues her reign as queen of Disney remakes with ""Herbie Fully Loaded"" a pleasingly retro recycling of ""The Love Bug"" (1969s highest-grossing pic) and its various feature and tube sequels. Though aimed primarily at a demographic much younger (and less aggressively hip) than the crowd that flocked to see Lohans somewhat saucier turn in last years ""Mean Girls"" family-friendly comedy about an amazingly anthropomorphic 63 VW Beetle likely will further enhance actresss marquee value. More important pic should prove a potent B.O. performer as G-rated alternative to darker and/or edgier summer fare. Working from script credited to small platoon of scribes (and based on characters created by Gordon Buford) helmer Angela Robinson smoothly shifts gears from her coming-out comedy ""D.E.B.S."" for a different take on girl power. Title sequence amusingly quotes earlier ""Herbie"" pics to accompaniment of apt Beach Boys tune (""Getcha Back"") sounding a 70s nostalgic note that occasionally reprises in split-screen visuals musical cues and some deliberately low-tech special effects. But characterization of thoroughly modern Maggie Peyton (Lohan) goes a long way toward giving familiar material a contempo spin. Newly graduated from college Maggie is bound for New York to accept an assistant producer gig at ESPN. Her career choice comes as great relief to her widowed father Ray Peyton Sr. (Michael Keaton) a fading NASCAR champ who wants his less-than-promising son (Breckin Meyer) not his born-to-drive daughter to carry on the family tradition of high-speed competition. Before she can leave the West Coast however Maggie makes a fateful visit to an auto junkyard to procure low-cost transportation. Thats where she spots Herbie the magical VW Bug in a sorry state of disrepair. Unaware of the cars miraculous powers she buys the apparent clunker for 75. It doesnt take long for her to discover what a bargain shes found. Indeed Maggie wins a street race without really trying -- without really driving actually -- when the mysteriously sentient Herbie takes her along for the ride while defeating an ultra-expensive rig driven by vainglorious champ Trip Murphy (Matt Dillon). Encouraged by Kevin (Justin Long) a mechanic friend and would-be suitor Maggie contrives to continue racing without the knowledge of her disapproving father. Naturally since this is a G-rated Disney pic nothing good comes of this deception. Just as naturally however resourceful Maggie and resilient Herbie have the right stuff to weather a few speed bumps -- including a detour through a demolition derby and a couple of grudge rematches with Trip -- on their way to the winners circle. Given the amount of tabloid coverage recently given to Lohans offscreen travails some people who have nothing better to do may peruse ""Fully Loaded"" for signs of the stars much-publicized physical gains and losses. (Insert joke about headlights here.) But vast majority of pics target aud will pay little heed to such matters and instead will enjoy the perky sincerity of Lohans appealing perf as a young woman feeling her way through a coming-of-age transition that takes her from skateboarding to fast-tracking. (For the record ""Herbie Fully Loaded"" is Lohans third Disney remake or sequel after 1998s ""The Parent Trap"" and 2003s ""Freaky Friday."") Not surprisingly Herbie (and his various stand-ins or drive-ins or whatever) easily upstages all of Lohans human co-stars. Still its worth noting that Keaton Long and Dillon are thoroughgoing pros in roles that usually attract attention only when theyre overplayed. Even as the sneering villain of the piece Dillon tries to keep things real giving a perf that is genuinely funny but effectively understated. Another standout Jill Ritchie as Maggies ditzy friend is just comical enough in small doses. Tech wizards led by visual effects supervisor John Van Vliet provide movie magic that except for flashes of obvious CGI trickery appear deliberately tamped down to better resemble look of earlier ""Herbie"" adventures. Sight gags involving Herbies defense mechanisms (spurting oil ejection seats flapping doors etc.) and expressive accessories (including a ""smiling"" front bumper) are old-school touches that despite their familiarity generate most of the laughs theyre designed to get.
