Mama cant decide Add to ... Adam Nayman Special to The Globe and Mail Published Saturday Jan. 19 2013 1200AM EST Last updated Thursday Feb. 21 2013 133PM EST Comments AA Directed by Andres Muschietti Written by Neil Cross Barbara Muschietti and Andres Muschietti Starring Jessica Chastain Nikolaj Coster-Waldau Classification 14A Country USA Language English Mama is a wraithlike apparition who is very protective of the adopted daughters she rescued from their depressed gun-toting father. As such shes a reasonably sympathetic antagonist for a supernatural horror movie even if her protectiveness sometimes takes the form of violence visited upon the girls new guardians and even though she looks a little bit like Ann Coulter (all resemblances to actual persons living or undead are of course entirely coincidental). She also cuts a genuinely freaky figure. In expanding his own extremely effective 2008 short film (also titled Mama) Spanish director Andres Muschietti has wisely retained its signature image of a blurry spectre floating ominously at the end of a dimly lit hallway. As the money shot for a three-minute short film it was priceless - a creepy tableau - but the feature-length version repeats it so frequently as to render it dirt-cheap.Muschiettis feature debut is also dramatically impoverished trotting out ghost-story cliches without any hesitation To wit the opening sequence actually takes place in the proverbial cabin in the woods. There is a nice shivery tone to the early scenes which elliptically depict the first encounter between Mama and two imperilled toddlers and the pairs subsequent discovery five years later by investigators hired by their Uncle Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau). Safely returned to civilization eight-year-old Victoria (Megan Charpentier) and six-year-old Lily (Isabelle Nelisse) are twitchy wary and mostly mute - which doesnt stop Lucas from bringing them home to live with him and his rocker-chick girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain). Suffice to say that Mama comes along for the ride laying low during the daytime and using her former foundlings bedroom closet as a base of spooky operations.Introduced while tensely sweating the results of a home pregnancy test the tattooed bass-slapping Annabel doesnt think shes ready for kids - especially not half-feral foundlings - and Chastains effortless performance goes a long way toward grounding the proceedings in a relatable reality. For the film to work the audience has to buy into the battle of wills between two maternal figures - one reluctant and vulnerable the other pathologically devoted and able to pass through walls - and if it sounds like a backhanded compliment to say that the actress holds her own against the supernatural Mama its also true that shes the only human who leaves any sort of impression. Coster-Waldaus father figure is a stiff (the filmmakers smartly put him into a coma around the midway point) the little girls are straight out of creepy-cherub casting and as a sinister child psychologist trying to exploit the situation for professional gain Daniel Kash is simply defeated by the roles head-slapping obviousness.The films long middle section is basically Paranormal Activity sans that series handicam aesthetic as things go bump in the night and the grown-ups take forever to get their act together. Theres also some back-story about Mamas pre-haunting days which is predictably tragic and intended to deepen her character but only undercuts her effectiveness as a bogeywoman. When Muschietti decides late in the game to tug at the heartstrings rather than go for the jugular its the gesture of a filmmaker who is trying to transcend the genre hes working in. The problem is that his movie barely meets the minimum generic requirements and thus comes off as pretentious for presuming to hover so airily above them.Special to The Globe and Mail Report Typo/Error Follow us on Twitter GlobeArts Comments AA In the know Report on Business In tough job market highly educated feel the squeeze Obituary Robert-Ralph Carmichael created the art on Canadas loonie CARRICK TALKS MONEY Whats the case for Americans living in Canada to renounce their U.S. citizenship?

The Best of Sundance << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous Thank You Coaches  Next The Keystone Kops Voltage Pictures Facebook Twitter Print ILM The Best of Sundance Sex Snow and Jessica Chastain by Wesley Morris on January 28 2013 I f youre not having enough sex or if the sex youre having isnt enough for your partner come to the Sundance Film Festival where everybody from Julianne Moore to Kristen Bell has tips for how to make better love to a woman. This has always been a good place for people -- usually young white boys -- looking to lose their virginity. But this year is short on virgins and longish on sex that inspires that like-a-virgin feeling. When Moore runs her hands through Joseph Gordon-Levitts hair in Don Jons Addiction and proceeds to climb atop his lap its as though all the American movie love youve seen in the last two and a half decades has been a lie. You rarely see sex like this between two actors who arent having that sex on a set in the San Fernando Valley. The way Gordon-Levitt and Moore look at each other is what you want from two people intensely attracted to each other hot romantic and embarrassingly sincere. Embarrassing because its almost too tender to watch so tender that it feels private so private that continuing to look should get you slapped with a restraining order. Gordon-Levitt wrote and directed Don Jons Addiction and it has the sort of high-energy self-belief of Sundance discoveries like Dito Montiel that Queens native whose filmmaking is a mix of dirty fingernails and 40 rosaries. (Montiel made a name for himself here in 2006 with A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints  but his strongest movie is Fighting -- the best boxing movie no one remembers since John Hustons Fat City all the way back in 1972.) Don Jon doesnt have Montiels laborious approach to self-confession. It was filmed in Hackensack and set in the sort of blue-collar Jersey where the men still eat Sunday dinner in a so-called wife-beater and where a kids keys to happiness include a good gelled-up haircut a nice car and a woman to bed and probably discard. The addiction here is sex. Gordon-Levitt plays Jon Martello Jr. a muscly macho goon who enumerates for us the ways in which sitting at his laptop watching porn beats spending a night with a real live woman even if that woman is Scarlett Johansson who at last achieves the film-acting equivalent of growing into her ears. Jons addiction to porn becomes a part of the characters obsession and compulsion and the argument the film makes for his preference is almost convincing. He likes the tidiness of the fantasy the way the sexual particulars in an adult movie are perfect -- the jiggling the gymnastics the substitution for a connection with an actual partner. The movie finds a hilarious rhythm for Jons compare-contrast analysis of actual intercourse versus the vicarious version -- the visual ping-ponging from the thrusting on his mattress to his cut-rate Mac and back again. (Lauren Zuckerman is the editor and she creates the equivalent of a pop songs hooky loop -- laptop gym church nightclub Sunday dinner; repeat). He sees Johanssons character Barbara in a club and has to have her. Shes a home-grown bombshell an hourglass of suggestiveness -- the gum-chewing the bodaciousness the hair. Shes what Mira Sorvino could have made a career of if she hadnt become instantly famous for playing that part for laughs -- the cunning ditz. Her cheesiness is drawn to Jons cheesiness. But shes enough of a unique creation to want more from him than his preening and low ambition. She keeps his attention by denying him intercourse bringing him to her front door and not letting him in. But that suggestiveness has higher designs. She wants to take The Situation and turn him into Antonin Scalia. Jon brings her to Mass and to the Martello family dinners which have a separate comic rhythm around Jons overwrought mother (Glenne Headly long-lost no more) hothead dad (Tony Danza) and a zombie sister (Brie Larson) lethargically strung out on her smartphone. The beauty of this movie is the way Gordon-Levitt is always two or three steps ahead of us. He locates the soulfulness in popular Italian and Jersey stereotypes and uses stock characters to pose real questions about the difference between a mans understanding of masculinity and a womans how a womans sense of femininity cant allow for tasks conventionally construed as feminine. Jon promises Barbara that hell kick the porn but cant. Their neurotic ideas of gender threaten to destroy the relationship. M oore plays his night-school classmate a needy weirdo to whom he finds himself drawn and there are a lot of movies at Sundance that feature the connection between older women and younger men (and women). Several of these films are in the U.S. dramatic competition and since Im serving on the jury this year Im forbidden from elaborating. But generally the remarkable trend this year is that its focused less on the difference in age than on the difference in experience. What makes Gordon-Levitt and Moore so fantastic together is that the wisdom she gives off feels truly wise. She knows what she finds sexy and draws that out of Gordon-Levitt an intense performer who if were being honest has never been more than cute -- cutely damaged (Mysterious Skin Hesher Lincoln) cutely wired (Inception 50/50 Premium Rush Looper) cutely cute ((500) Days of Summer).The comic machismo here and the vulnerability beneath it are new for him. This is like Saturday Night Fever with the emphasis placed on personal grooming rather than trendy glamour. Its like Marty without the self-pity and with way more sex. Its another Italian man struggling to free himself from his family. Where in Fever John Travoltas Tony Manero wanted to leave Brooklyn to surf the crest of disco to become a star Jon thinks he wants to tread into domestic bliss with a nice piece of ass. The cultural stakes are lower. Its been built around the unmentionable universality of horniness. You cant celebrate its triumph the way you can Tonys dancing or the end of Marty Pilettis loneliness in Marty. Youre happy that this kid might have found a better way to be a man. Don Jons Addiction isnt out to make a star of its director. But it does make a director of its star. A few days ago Relativity Media paid 4 million for Don Jons Addiction in a deal that also includes 25 million to distribute and market it. But that still didnt count as the festivals mega-millions jackpot. That title was claimed when Fox Searchlight paid almost 10 million for The Way Way Back a comedy about a teenager (Liam James) who spends the summer at an old water park. Nat Faxon and Jim Rash wrote and directed it -- they shared writing credit and an Oscar win with the director Alexander Payne for The Descendants; theyre also on sitcoms (the recently canceled Ben and Kate for Faxon; Community for Rash). The Way Way Back deploys the same Teflon comedy as their respective shows. Nothing sticks emotionally and up to a point that works. It has Little Miss Sunshines Steve Carell and Toni Collette together again. Yet the movie smacks of Adventureland a tonally awkward comedy set at a crumbling amusement park that made some waves here in 2009. Even so you get the sense that what Faxon and Rash Searchlight the festival and the audience all want is to recreate that Little Miss Sunshine feeling. Thats not what the title refers to but it might as well. Most movies arrive here homeless and many very good ones leave that way. As of now Alexandre Moorss Blue Caprice is still living in a cardboard box but deserves a distributor. It reenacts the 2002 Beltway sniper murders as the story of a Caribbean teenager Lee Boyd Malvo (Tequan Richmond) whos desperate for a parent and finds a father figure in John Allen Muhammad (Isaiah Washington). Moors wrote the movie with R.F.I. Porto and its not looking for a motive for the shootings so much as its trying to make a dramatic case for what might have allowed Malvo to participate in them. A movie about two black men on a killing spree could go all kinds of wrong. But this one operates with a moral chill that doesnt identify with these two or even gratuitously humanize them. The movie is actually timid about politics. I dont recall hearing Muhammads last name and theres no mention of his radicalist embrace and perversion of Islam. Instead the film creates one of the most chillingly becalmed portraits of insanity Ive seen. Washington doesnt rant or rave but his keel is usually uncomfortably uneven like a man who doesnt know that his fly is always down. Richmond might say a dozen words the entire movie but the way he reroutes his steeliness from self-protective innocence to evil is a kind of silent-movie master class. This is Moorss first feature and he works with rich terrifying documentary-like meticulousness. A lot of the shots are saturated with color and hauntingly framed. Like Spike Lees Summer of Sam and David Finchers Zodiac it finds the sort of dread that knots your stomach often mercifully by showing you very little of the murders but enough to fear what you know is coming. The films iconic images involve the car itself a 12-year-old cobalt Chevy Caprice that Muhammad and Malvo rigged for their spree -- the way it drifts along I-95 its taillights glowing a satanic red; the insinuating way it sits in parking lots and near gas stations almost breathing almost alive; the manner in which we see Malvo slither from the backseat into the dark trunk to aim his military rifle through the small hole theyve bored. You see him do this in detail only once. But you watch him mount the gun and hear him coordinate with Muhammad when to shoot and your blood goes cold knowing they performed this ritual at least 13 times. I saw this movie close to midnight two days ago and Ive been uneasy ever since. O ne afternoon I took a break from the festival to see another kind of horror film the kind thats junked up with special effects and noise and 100 cuts per minute the sort of horror film were used to getting a couple of times a month that has a couple of good scares but a story as flat as an X-file. I took a break to see Mama. I went because Jessica Chastain is in it and because it was the countrys no. 1 film last week which means between that and Kathryn Bigelows Zero Dark Thirty Chastain is starring in the top two movies in America which feels like a coronation of sorts. In Mama she wears her blackish hair Liza Minnelli short and sports a tattoo on her arm and dresses the way punky goths did in 1992. Shes a bassist in a garage band that might as well be called Thirty Dark Zeros. Well she was the bassist until she quit and moved into a big suburban house to raise her boyfriends two long-missing nieces. Theyve turned up feral and nasty having been raised by a computer-generated witch-ghost who looks like an expressionist bag lady. Needless to say the witch-ghost has a miserable backstory and is rendered as a splotchy special effect that sneaks up behind people and appears on the walls and in corners toward the ceiling. But the movie -- which Andres Muschietti an Argentine directed and Guillermo Del Toro produced -- has more integrity than its creepshow peers. The story basically comes down to a dead-looking woman who doesnt want to be a mother fighting for parental custody against a long-dead woman who does. (Grad students start your theses.) Theres a nifty dream sequence that looks like its covered in ectoplasm and has the trashy kick of certain Italian horror hacks. But the movie has nowhere new to go (except the faint promise of a sequel) and has even less for Chastain to do. Thats a common complaint about her in Bigelows movie that the part is too underwritten to show her off. It is. But Chastain is excellent with the monomania shes given to play. In two years shes become a something-from-nothing kind of actor who at 35 has a lot less nothing to look forward to. To that end it bears repeating that the top two movies at the box office star the same woman and one was directed by a woman. The other was co-written and co-produced by one. Perhaps its foolish to wish but I hope someone in Hollywood can look at that chart and at least pretend its some kind of mandate. An earlier version of this review stated that Andres Muschietti the director of Mama is Spanish. Hes actually an Argentine who lives and works in Spain.

So says a grey-haired archivist in Argentinian filmmaker Andres Muschiettis over-egged English-language supernatural chiller. These words also fit perfectly with executive producer Guillermo del Toros view that the best ghost stories are suffused with melancholy. Sadly particularly in the overwrought climactic scenes the films tear-jerking conflict between distorted and nascent maternal love is drowned out by a surfeit of flashy visual effects. Developed from his own three-minute short film Muschiettis first feature lumbers tattooed rock chick Annabel (Jessica Chastain) and her artist boyfriend with two feral children abandoned in the woods and left to run wild when his brother committed suicide five years before. Neither is good parent material but with the help of a kindly shrink and despite an interfering aunt the couple struggle to care for the partly socialised Victoria and her wilder younger sister Lilly. Yet as the reluctant Annabel slowly discovers her own maternal instincts she realises she is in competition with Mama (Javier Botet) a jealous spectral presence with its own primal need to protect the children. The bony angular Botet - familiar from the final scenes of [Rec] - invests Mama with an air of fierce floating menace suffused with a deep underlying sadness. However in stark contrast to Chastains credible affecting transformation from selfish musician to loving mother the secondary characters and sub-plots are sketchily drawn. The ambiguous shrinks archival rummagings and hypnotherapy sessions with Victoria merely fill in Mamas back story; the aunts threats to involve social services come to nothing. Also by splitting the action between several different characters and locations the plot dissipates the suspense and lacks focus as if it has been bolted together from disparate ill-fitting pieces.

Guillermo del Toro served as executive producer for this moody Spanish-Canadian chiller and it benefits greatly from his touch; a modern day Val Lewton del Toro has a knack for rooting horror stories in folk-tale mythos. This debut feature by Andres Muschietti uses Lewtons The Curse of the Cat People as its template probing the dark recesses of a childs imagination and considering the role of maternal figures in fairy tales.

"Mama and John Dies at the End Two horror films reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Mama and the Rise of Artisanal Horror Mama and the Rise of Artisanal Horror Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Jan. 24 2013 734 PM In Praise of Artisanal Horror Mama and John Dies at the End want to scare you--their way. By Dana Stevens Rob Mayes as John in John Dies at the End Courtesy Magnet Releasing. A few years ago writing about Oren Pelis Paranormal Activity franchise Ti Wests House of the Devil and other experiments in craft-conscious low-budget horror I gave a name to the loosely defined style I saw these movies as sharing ""artisanal horror."" The term caught on only in my own brain where its become a handy taxonomic classification for a subgenre that seems here to stay even in the age of the big-budget special-effects-laden franchise. The horror genre has always welcomed tinkerers--inventive filmmakers who are interested in taking genres conventions apart and fitting them back together in novel ways. If the desired effect of maximum audience creep-out has to be achieved on a minimal budget so much the better. Artisanal horror directors place a high value on cheapskate ingenuity the trick of scaring the audience pantsless with the simplest possible effect an unexpected camera movement a barely glimpsed shadow a hand reaching for a doorknob. And they tend to pay some sort of tribute to the genres roots in low-budget exploitation sometimes by citing their B-movie forebears outright (as did Joss Whedons Cabin in the Woods which was artisanal in spirit if not in budget) sometimes just by letting the seams in the monster costumes show. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Two new movies--very different but both very good-- showcase the expressive range of the artisanal-horror style. One Don Coscarellis John Dies at the End is a gleefully crummy buddy comedy that uses horror-movie conventions as catapults to hurl the audience down one ""whoa dude"" narrative wormhole after another. The other Andy Muschiettis Mama is a somber elegant variation on a classic fairytale that takes us almost nowhere unexpected but still makes the trip scary as hell. Since Don Coscarellis breakthrough at the age of 23 with Phantasm (1979)--a bracingly original screamer that quickly became a cult classic and whose airborne metallic sphere of death will forever haunt my dreams--his movies have been few and far between but dependably bizarre. Bubba Ho-Tep (2002) told the story of a geriatric Elvis Presley (Bruce Campbell) who joins forces with a black man claiming to be John F. Kennedy (Ossie Davis) to fight a reanimated Egyptian mummy thats sucking up the souls of their fellow nursing-home inmates--a thumbnail description that does significant injustice to the coiling ingenuity of that movies plot. Advertisement John Dies at the End based on a comic horror novel of the same (excellent) title by David Wong has a story thats similarly irreducible to summation A pair of smartass twentysomething friends Dave (Chase Williamson) and John (Rob Mayes) come into possession of a dangerous drug called Soy Sauce which gives its users seemingly limitless powers of awareness and prescience. As a skeptical journalist (Paul Giamatti) listens to Daves story in the booth of a Chinese restaurant alternate realities and interpretations thereof succeed one another like Kleenex from a box Are Dave and John mixed up in a string of brutal murders that happened the night they first took the drug? Or are they the murderers next victims? Is it possible that John is already dead but continuing to transmit crime-solving tips from beyond the grave on a psychic phone made of bratwurst? And not to sound paranoid but what if space aliens are behind this whole thing? John Dies at the End is joyously heterodox in its method an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink melange of sci-fi black comedy and action with disquieting body-horror sight gags that at times recall David Cronenbergs Naked Lunch. (A doorknob suddenly transforms into a dangling penis; a mustache rips itself off a mans face and flies around the room like a bat.) The storys rabbit holes got so deep that I cant actually tell you whether the movies title is a spoiler or not but I loved John Dies at the End for so confidently whisking the viewer to a place where the question ""Well did he die or didnt he?"" seems hopelessly un-nuanced and square. Isabelle Nelisse Nikolaj Coster-Waldau Megan Charpentier and Jessica Chastain in Mama Courtesy Universal Pictures. If John Dies at the End represents the wild side of artisanal horror Mama resides somewhere closer to the classical end of the spectrum Its a minimalist riff on an age-old ghost story. Jessica Chastain (looking uncharacteristically Goth but gorgeous in raccoon-eye makeup and a brunette shag) plays Annabel a less-than-maternal aspiring rock bassist who finds herself in sole charge of two disturbed young girls after theyre discovered living an animal-like existence on their own in a remote forest cabin. (A grim precredit sequence explains how they got there.) Her boyfriend (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) the girls uncle insists on adopting the children before falling into a narratively convenient coma the better to strand Annabel in a house with two increasingly freaked-out and freaky little girls. Its not hard to forgive Mama this introductory plot contrivance because the story at the movies heart is so simple and powerful we cant wait to get to the good stuff either. As Annabel struggles to build some kind of relationship with the children resilient Victoria (Megan Charpentier) and her more damaged younger sister Lilly (Isabelle Nelisse) she becomes aware of a fourth presence in the house--a malevolent wispy something that for most of the movie we like Annabel witness only out of the corner of our eye but that seems to hold the girls transfixed. According to the child psychiatrist whos treating Victoria (Daniel Kash) the children invented an imaginary mother during their years of parentless existence in the cabin. Is it possible their shared hallucination has Annabel seeing things as well? Or is ""Mama"" the maternal wraith the girls insist lives in their closet all too real and none too happy about sharing her charges with a flesh-and-blood woman? Like most haunted-house stories Mama gets steadily less scary as its (for the most part fairly predictable) secrets unfold. But even if the beats are familiar Muschietti sustains a remarkable mood throughout wintry elemental and stark like a late Sylvia Plath poem. This relentlessly spooky but almost gore-free movie ends with a woman-on-ghost confrontation at the precipice of a steep cliff thats as stark an allegory for the power of maternal love as Sigourney Weavers climactic battle with the mother-monster in Aliens. (""Get away from her you bitch"") Youd have to be a monster yourself not to be moved by this final showdown in which Chastains previously diffident character suddenly grasps how unbearable it would be to lose either of these children and understands in that same moment that they are truly hers.

Im sick of all the unhappy endings with their nihilist final shots confirming that evil can never be put down -- partly because a lot of people no longer buy the idea of closure in our senselessly violent culture mostly because studios need their demons evergreen for those cheap income-generating horror ""franchises."" Ive started to avoid horror movies -- my lifes blood. But I got a healthful transfusion from Mama directed by first-timer Andres (Andy) Muschietti and produced by lifelong genre freak Guillermo del Toro. The plotting isnt fresh and the politics are a tad reactionary but the movie is also shapely rounded satisfying -- a classical ghost story. It ends with a heartrending primal trauma and yet it has the sort of closure you dont see anymore in horror pictures. Youre left with more than the feeling that youve been mugged. Del Toro gravitates to fairy tales of imperiled children torn between good and evil guardians -- and often torn apart by the process. At the center of Mama are two little blonde sisters the watchful Victoria (Megan Charpentier) and the wee imp Lilly (Isabelle Nelisse). In the tumultuous prologue theyre kidnapped by their crazed father -- he has just shot their mother -- and on the verge of being murdered in an abandoned house in the middle of a snowbound forest when ... Well what happens is in one way very very good and in another very very bad. Which is an excellent way to start a horror film. Our sympathies are confounded. Five years on the girls are discovered in that cabin by trackers hired by their uncle Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) and are at first barely recognizable as human. (CGI helps.) They hiss and claw and scamper around on all fours. Lilly was barely a toddler when she entered that cabin and is particularly far gone. Whisked away she calls out ""Mama."" Uncle Lucas is the male hero but hes sidelined for most of the picture. Its his live-in girlfriend Annabel whos the protagonist. Shes played by Jessica Chastain hair cut sharp and died raven-black her eyes rimmed with mascara. Apart from her bone structure and that dimpled chin you can barely recognize Chastain from -- well any of her eight or nine parts in the last two years (which is presumably why she took the role to show off her Streepishness). Annabel is a Goth rocker who doesnt want kids which we know because in her first scene she takes a pregnancy test and exhales with relief when its negative (a little on-the-nose but the plot point registers). Its quite a challenge for Annabel to care for two feral girls at the behest of a hovering therapist (Daniel Kash) who thinks that the kids belong not in a hospital (or in the case of the younger a zoo) but a stable sweet home. His institute even supplies one -- a big suburban house with plenty of closet space for demons. Whats obvious from the first few scenes is that Mama will come down to whether Annabel will selfishly desert these girls or bond with them and in the process discover her own maternal instincts -- the only effective weapon against the title character. This is the kind of conservative moralistic theme (independent women arent natural) that has given horror pictures a bad rep among university genre scholars. But Im bound to say without spoiling anything that the movies example of a devoted mother is a lot more terrifying. The title character is as Im pretty sure you know a ghost and one of modern cinemas eeriest a spidery thing with a face thats a dry-rotted mask of pain and rage. She looks too unnatural to be anything other than CGI but apparently shes (mostly) flesh and blood embodied by an actor named Javier Boutet with something called Marfan syndrome that allows him to dislocate all of his joints. I know Ew. As in most modern horror films too many of Mamas scares come with a fortissimo orchestral ""Boo"" to make you jump. But others owe their power to Muschiettis fluid staging and knack for putting Mama in the part of the frame where you least expect her. Fernando Velazquezs deliciously hammy music helps First growly and foreboding it can swell to gratifying heights with vocals that sound like a chorus of children in a sepulcher. The music accompanies swirling swooping eye-popping expressionist dream sequences -- visions really telepathically induced by this jealous and very volatile spirit for reasons that arent dramatically clear. (Why would she be telling her story to Annabel whom shes trying to kill?) But I like the look of those sequences too much to complain. The most wrenching question in Mama turns out to be not whether Annabel can be a mom but whether either or both of these little girls will have the emotional capacity (and smarts) to forsake a steadfast but demonic psycho mama for one who might be less constant but wont suck out anyones innards. I was guessing right till the bitter scary transcendent end. Another thing I loved Theres no sequel in sight.

"Mama | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; mama ) Mama (Spain/Canada 2013) January 19 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Mama follows an unfortunate recent pattern that has emerged in low-budget horror films especially those with PG-13 ratings. It starts out strongly using evocative visuals and an unsettling backstory to establish a creepy tableau but it proves unable to sustain those strengths all the way to the finish line. Narrative weakness and bad horror tropes get in the way and Mamas ending disappoints. Executive produced by Guillermo del Toro and helmed by first-time feature director Andres Muschietti (based on his 2008 short) Mama starts out fresh and intriguing but gradually devolves into a ""more of the same"" ghost story with no real twists or surprises to keep things interesting. The prologue is forceful and drips with promise. A man having shot two co-workers and his ex-wife kidnaps his two young daughters (ages one and three) and flees with them to an unknown destination. He loses control of his car when driving too fast on a snowy road. After the crash he wanders with the kids through the woods until they come to a dilapidated cabin - the clichA(c)d haunted house in the middle of nowhere. Once inside as he prepares a double murder-suicide something emerges from the dark to snatch him away. The girls are left by themselves with only this creature as their companion. After a break for the opening credits the story picks up five years later. The girls Victoria (Megan Charpentier) and Lilly (Isabelle Nelisse) now eight and six have been discovered living on their own in the cabin. Feral distrusting of people and with a disturbing tendency to scuttle spider-like on all fours they are brought to an institute where they are studied by a psychiatrist Dr. Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash) until being released into the custody of their uncle Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones) and his goth rocker girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain). Annabel isnt the mothering type and suddenly having two children underfoot isnt her idea of the perfect life. To make matters worse the girls dont come on their own - they bring with them ""Mama"" their ""friend"" from the cabin. It doesnt take long before Annabel left alone with the children after Lucas is hospitalized following a mysterious tumble down the stairs recognizes that something is very wrong. The movie boasts a strong emotional component in the relationship that develops between Annabel the reluctant step-parent and the girls. Its reminiscent of how James Cameron used the Ripley/Newt interaction in Aliens - a deeply human subplot that seeks to enrich a traditional genre entry. This is where the importance of casting a multifaceted actress like Jessica Chastain comes into play. She makes Annabel real and because we accept the character the relationship no matter how improbable feels genuine. The more the viewer cares about the bond between Annabel and Victoria (and to a lesser degree Annabel and Lilly) the easier it is to overlook obvious weaknesses in other aspects of the production. As is mandatory for PG-13 horror movies there are plenty of ""boo"" moments. Theres also a unique and unnerving shot that may define how we remember this film. With the camera placed at one end of an upstairs hall we are provided with a deep focus image that juxtaposes the supernatural with the mundane. This is the kind of stand-out scene that can get a filmmaker noticed. For much of Mama Muschietti teases us with oblique views of the title creature wisely electing to enhance suspense by avoiding a full ""reveal."" Unfortunately late in the film extended views of the apparition dispel the illusion Mama is an unremarkable ghoul a too-obvious special effect that is poorly served by close-ups and unobscured shots. Pacing is an issue. Mama unspools slowly allowing viewers to soak up the atmosphere but theres too little story to fill 100-odd minutes. The movie often seems to be repeating itself and during stretches when not much is happening beyond oversized moths crawling out of walls Mama relies on those tried-but-true jump scares to keep attentions from wandering. Complexities and intriguing subplots introduced in the early-going are either dropped or abruptly concluded and characters start doing ""stupid horror things"" that we dont expect in films that seek to be labeled as ""smart"" or ""fresh."" Why would someone time their arrival at a haunted house after dark? The final fifteen minutes represent Mama at its weakest - not a good thing for any movie but too often the case with horror films. Paradoxically the climax feels both rushed and sluggish. Nearly devoid of tension it unspools in a protracted and unsatisfying fashion although the scenes leading up to the finale advance the narrative in short perfunctory bursts. Annabels emotional connection with the children lends some heft to the final sequence although much what happens doesnt make a lot of sense. Chastains solid performance combined with effective camerawork throughout keep concerns about narrative inconsistencies and logical hiccups at bay for a while. This is a good-looking motion picture that emphasizes style over story. Resolutions especially those that overexplain supernatural motivations often diminish horror movie conclusions and this common flaw damages Mama. The film is a decidedly mixed bag that offers a few good scares but not a whole lot more.

In Mama shes attacked by one. Chastain shot this dignified little thriller in fall 2011 during the stretch when literally every arthouse theater played at least two of her pictures--between Tree Coriolanus The Help Take Shelter Texas Killing Fields and The Debt she was indie cinemas inescapable new queen. Universal intended to release the Guillermo del Toro-produced Mama last October but shelved it until the week after Chastain was nominated for an Oscar for Zero Dark Thirty. Is this her reputation-besmirching Norbit? Pshaw -- for my money its her best performance yet. Mama starts with a childs hand scrawling ""Once upon a time"" words that send us all the way back to uh the financial collapse of 2008. A Wall Street bigshot (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) has a nervous breakdown He shoots his co-workers shoots his wife and kidnaps his two girls ages 3 and 1 with the intent of hiding out and shooting them too. (Alas murder-suicide is todays version of parents in the Brothers Grimm casting out their children to survive in the forest.) The place he chooses to pull the trigger is a cabin in the woods that belongs to ""Mama"" a ghost who doesnt take kindly to deadly dads. Side note Why is Hollywood newly obsessed with monsters who are painfully thin and flexible? Its as if our entire generation grew up having nightmares about a double-jointed Karen Carpenter. As the opening credits roll kiddie crayon sketches show us what happened next The scared blonde tykes cling to their new ghost mommy and revert to crawling on all fours and eating rats. Its a feral child fairy tale Cut to the present where we first meet rocker girl Annabel (Chastain) beaming at an EPT test overjoyed that her boyfriend (Coster-Waldau again) hasnt gotten her pregnant. Alas her guy turns out to be the girls uncle and his detectives have finally found Mamas lair. Surprise Annabels about to be the adopted mother of two crab-walking nightmares and she really doesnt want to meet their babysitter. Every beat in Mama is familiar down to the exact moment you need to close your eyes to dodge a jump-scare and theres a goofy child psychiatrist (Daniel Kash) whose actions make about as much sense as Claire Danes in Homeland. But damned if Mama doesnt transcend its nonsense. As in Paranormal Activity 3 the girls -- now 6 and 8 but psychologically closer to wildcats in captivity -- spend a lot of time in their bedroom playing tug-of-war with their spooky spectral caretaker and humming creepy hymns. Young actresses Isabelle Nelisse and Megan Charpentier are excellent with Nelisse frighteningly primal and Charpentier as her guilt-stricken and watchful older sister. The best call in the script is the slow wedge thats driven between the girls the real world and the world only they believe in. The kids are scary but they dont thrill to see Chastain scream. Instead their loyalty is torn between the only mother theyve ever known and you know the one who doesnt look like an anorexic hellbeast. One standout chase sequence shows us Mamas back story in a retro filmstrip style that looks like one of D.W. Griffiths nightmares. But Mamas smartest choice is the decision by helmer Andres Muschietti (who also co-wrote the script with Barbara Muschietti and Neil Cross) to cast Chastain for insta-class. Chastain has carved out a career in shockingly fast time but shes been oddly ill-used by her directors who tend to see her as a figurehead not a woman. Shes been shoehorned into archetypes The fragile doll the vision of womanly perfection the sexless drone. It takes this slight but ambitious horror flick to let her be flesh-and-blood fun. Her Annabel is a tough short-haired dame whos inked with tattoos under her Misfits t-shirts. She plays guitar in a 90s-esque girl band -- god I wish we had more of those today -- and her cellphone voicemail barks ""This is Annabel. Leave a message at the beep. Fuck you -- beep."" As she warms slowly to the beast-children Chastain gets to play an arc not an archetype and Mama becomes an honest-to-god film instead of a quickie horror cash-in or a bone-dry drama that relies on Chastain to do all the heavy lifting. Kathryn Bigelow take note Surround Chastain with an actual movie and you might get a Oscar nod the next go-round. Amy Nicholson is a critic playwright and editor.

The acting wasnt terrible and the first 3/4 of the movie was passable as a thriller. The ending was just too awful.

"Review Mama is a witchs brew of frights and faults - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview Mama is a witchs brew of frights and faultsAndy Muschiettis horror film has its share of script and casting problems (including Jessica Chastains role) but the evil spirit is a shape-shifting marvel.January 17 2013|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Jessica Chastain left Isabelle Nailisse and Megan Charpentier... (George Kraychyk / Universal...)Beautifully envisioned badly constructed the only truly terrifying things in the new horror movie ""Mama"" are the fake tattoos short black hair and black T-shirts meant to turn ""Zero Dark Thirty"" star Jessica Chastain into a guitar-shredding punk rocker chick.That misfire becomes just one more bump in the road when you long for more bumps in the night. Though there are a few frights a a skittering shape that keeps showing up is the best a rather than dishing out pure scary movie chills first-time director Andy Muschietti serves up a darkly twisted allegory about a mothers protective instincts. Which would have been an excellent framing device and infinitely more satisfying for grown-ups if he had pulled it off. He doesnt quite.You can feel the imprint of the films guardian angel executive producer Guillermo del Toro but his touch is too light to help ""Mama"" cast the mystical magical spell of his Oscar-winning ""Pans Labyrinth."" Muschiettis 2008 short film much admired for its striking visuals and its scare as two children try to escape an evil force caught Del Toros eye. Soon he and Muschietti began a collaboration to turn ""Mama"" into a feature-length film. The basic sensibility of the short survives but the added setups and plots twists are a stretch.PHOTOS Haunted houses and deadly dwellings on filmThe filmmaker first wrote the script with sister Barbara Muschietti one of ""Mamas"" producers. Then it was reworked by Del Toro and finally polished by Neil Cross best known for creating the excellent British TV crime drama ""Luther."" You can almost feel ""Mamas"" pages passing through all those hands. (Cross and the Muschietti siblings share the credit.)The opening is a perfect example. To get to the witchy spirit driving the film two little girls need to end up in a cabin in the woods a alone. But first there is a car haphazardly parked on a suburban street its door open and radio blaring reports of a Wall Street massacre. A disheveled and distraught dad runs into a bedroom and gathers up his two daughters. Soon theyre on a mad drive over icy roads where the desperate travelers are thrown as many non sequiturs as curves. Finally after a lot of nonsense dad and daughters stumble across that proverbial horror movie staple a ""deserted"" cabin in the woods. We still dont know what is behind the histrionics and we never will. Becausea|The movie flashes forward five years. The girls cool uncle Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau who also plays his vanished brother Jeffrey) has been spending all his money searching for his nieces a Victoria (Megan Charpentier) and her little sister Lily (Isabelle Nelisse). His girlfriend Annabel (Chastain) tolerates the tiny apartment and his obsession because her real focus is ""the band."" There are so many things the Oscar-nominated actress can do so very well a comedy a la ""The Help"" or drama like ""Zero Dark Thirty"" a but a Joan Jett clone? Shes just too refined or she certainly stays that way in ""Mama.""Fortunately before too many guitar sessions the girls are found and the film starts ratcheting up the strange doings we were promised. The sights sounds lights and looks that follow are exceptional with an eerie earthy beauty to the scariest stuff. The spectral presence at the heart of this story is mesmerizing to watch as it morphs into monstrous shapes big and small. Overall the film is visually stunning with its crack creative team comprising director of photography Antonio Riestra production designer Anastasia Masaro the visual effects team led by Edward Taylor Montse Ribe and David Marti handling makeup and Luis Sequeira costume design.PHOTOS Horror movie locations around Los AngelesBut perhaps scariest of all is that after only a week or so of being evaluated by psychiatrist Dr. Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash) and a quick custody battle with Aunt Jean (Jane Moffat who also provides Mamas voice) Lucas Annabel Victoria and Lily are all living in a plush house paid for by Dreyfuss research institute. Lucas is thrilled; Annabel is resigned; the girls nearly feral and often walking on all fours are seriously damaged. So its hard not to shrink back with them when Annabel snaps a dont call me Mama.Never fear Annabel they werent talking to you.Mama (Javier Botet) is one of the most intriguing evil presences to turn up in horror movies in a while. Not only is the character a shape-shifting marvel to witness there are other frightening elements that attend her. All manner of creepy crawlies begin to fill the house unexplained marks start appearing on the walls voices fill the air as do moths a they look too sinister to be butterflies. There is a back story about restless spirits and how the dead like the living are condemned to repeat the past. But every time things start to get interesting the story shifts to something more mundane.People lie people die as Mamas rage builds up. Like Mama Chastain gathers strength along the way as her character is allowed to explore the dicey emotional terrain of motherhood and her growing bonds with the girls. In the fight for the children the metaphorical mother-child connection becomes a mystical horror show of significant power. Sadly it comes too late to save ""Mama.""betsy.sharkeylatimes.com PHOTOS AND MORE VIDEO The making of Argo Les Miz and more ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz PHOTOS NC-17 movies Ratings explained MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESNew releases Upstream Color is a complicated lost-souls...May 4 2013Review Scary Movie V moves between frenzied and stonedApril 12 20132013 movie sneak previewsJanuary 13 2013Indie Focus The Innkeepers Kill List are singular...January 29 2012Short films can be a shortcut to Hollywood successMay 9 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowNot_live_webEntertainment_not_live_webCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-mama-review20130118,0,6065018.story",200,mama8,mama,latimes

In the `90s studios started importing Hong Kong action auteurs; a decade later Korean masters of the macabre. It made sense as those filmmakers werent particularly fond of lengthy dialogue scenes or big-budget featherbedding -- two things that put them perfectly in sync with studio needs. But director Guillermo Del Toro has diversified cinema all by himself producing and presenting a new generation of Spanish-speaking fantasists -- Juan Antonio Bayona Sebastian Cordero Guillem Morales. The latest is the Argentine Andres Muschietti who -- his first name now Americanized to ""Andy"" -- has turned his own early horror short ""Mama"" into an American feature (albeit one shot abroad with a mostly foreign and unfamiliar cast). And its an interesting effort too - although sadly in the end ""effort"" is really the crucial word. It starts with a good mystery as a stressed-out father goes on a rampage killing his wife and taking his two small children deep into the wintry woods. Then something mysteriously kills him. Five years later the children are found alive and taken in by their uncle. Thats a good start and the ensuing story gets most of its life from Jessica Chastain who plays the uncles girlfriend -- and after these two strange nearly feral creatures come into her life has to learn how to become a mother. Its not an easy role for this punk-rock bassist to take on. But Annabel is definitely a role Chastain has fun playing. Shes always been a chameleon; here she seems both suddenly angular and voluptuous her eyes full of attitude her limbs full of impatient motion (and her dyed dark hair making her a surprising dead ringer for the no-nonsense Vera Farmiga). Its not a complicated character or a very serious movie -- and I hope its release now doesnt hurt Chastains Oscar chances -- but the actress takes it seriously and is very good in it. Muschietti meanwhile has an eye for some striking monochromatic visuals. He also -- like many of the spooky filmmakers Del Toro has championed -- prefers suggestion to gore and makes smart use of what happens outside the frame. Eventually though if youve got a supernatural being you have to show the supernatural being. And Muschiettis wraith is such a badly visualized bit of CGI -- with spindly cockroach limbs and a face like a hatchet -- that shes nothing but a letdown. Not that the script has been doing much to prop up the movie up until that point either. A number of incidents feel forced or prolonged and apart from Annabel - whose verve is almost solely due to Chastains performance -- the roles are far too broadly drawn. Muschietti may still have some good work in him; Del Toro has an excellent eye for talent. In fact I wish hed hook up with a cable channel to produce a new spooky anthology series; with a seasons worth of episodes to farm out he could give us two dozen new directors within the year. Thats one job I think even the ultra-busy Del Toro would find hard to pass up. And a blood transfusion that the genre could really use. Ratings note The film contains strong language and violence. Mama (R) Universal (100 min.) Directed by Andres Muschietti. With Jessica Chastain.

Mama has been dead for 125 years so shes missed the latest developments in parenting. For instance since old-timey days its been frowned upon to levitate the kids teach them to skitter on the floor like crabs or feed them bugs. But as for her conflicted emotions about raising small children -- sometimes she wants to play with them other times throw them off a cliff -- parents watching will agree that some things never change. This is the first 2008 financial-crisis horror flick Ive seen one that begins with a financier going bust going nuts and then murdering everyone in sight. He drives off a cliff with two daughters -- one a toddler one an infant -- but upon noticing that theyve survived he decides to shoot them anyway. Thats when (shrieking wraithlike) Mama shows up and proves that she is no more to be messed with than Tyler Perrys Madea. Mama is a spectral being who helps the two children survive alone in a cabin in the woods for five years which turns them into feral mangy beasts who jump like fleas and snarl like wolverines. Their dads brother Lucas (Nikolaj CosterWaldau) finally finds them after an exhaustive search causing disbelief in his happily childless punk-rocker girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain in Joan Jetts clothes). The two of them wind up leaving their messy urban alterna-world behind and raising the savage children together in a bland suburban dream house that disgusts Annabels Ramones-loving soul. Where the kids go however Mama follows. And she is one jealous bitch. As Annabel who is so tough her voice-mail message says ""F - - k you"" (edgy) Chastain has an excellent time. And so did I for most of the movie Its much more suspenseful than violent being careful not to allow us to figure out Mama too quickly. Bonus I love these anti-feminist allegories in which the independent unsentimental defiantly anti-motherhood chick is reformed by a taste of hearth and home. You know that by the second hour Annabel will be a hugging crying mess fiercely protective of her little ones and probably ordering a subscription to Redbook. First-time writer-director Andy Muschietti an Argentine discovered by Guillermo del Toro relies too much especially in the early going on horror cliches (sudden loud noises and jagged blasts of music) but he does make the tension hum. What ghost-Mama does to people she doesnt like yields some wickedly creepy images but the title character is scarier before we get a good look at her. Lots of scenes put special effects above story (Mama keeps oozing through walls preceded by cloudbursts of butterflies for no particular reason except it looks cool). The many near-misses of Annabel almost discovering the otherworldly visitor become repetitive and the back story is discovered far too easily. (Randomly a records clerk disgorges all the secrets). But despite a great-looking climactic scene that shows off Mamas talents she is a poorly thought-out character Youd think shed just kill everyone who threatens to keep her from the kids instantly. Moreover as psychotically overprotective moms go shes still less unpleasant than Barbra Streisand in ""The Guilt Trip.""

Starring Jessica Chastain Nikolaj Coster-Waldau Megan Charpentier Isabelle Nelisse Daniel Kash Director Andres Muschietti Running time 140 Release Opened Jan 18 2013  Editorial Review Dont mess with this mama grislyBy Michael OSullivanFriday January 18 2013Theres something dead and rotting at the center of ""Mama"" and it isnt the ghost of the woman who lends the horror film its title. (Note This is not a spoiler. We first meet Mama a mere five minutes into the movie. We hear about her even before that when a little girl announces before the opening credits have even rolled ""Daddy theres a woman outside; shes not touching the floor."" So much for suspense.) No the cadaverous entity that animates ""Mama"" is rather the corpse of the modern imagination. We have as filmgoers become so unused to using our own brains -- to think to feel to visualize the invisible -- that many filmmakers today feel compelled to show us everything. The contemporary horror film is like porn effective but soul-deadening. And so it is with ""Mama."" Sure its scary enough but cheaply not deeply. The story about two orphaned girls found living in a remote cabin in the woods with an ectoplasmic caregiver contains enough frights to satisfy the minimum recommended allowance. But it doesnt engender the kind of dread that lingers as you walk from the theater lobby to the parking garage. Mama the CGI ghoul is scary as heck. ""Mama"" the movie isnt. The movie opens with a brief prologue which while stylishly shot gives way too much away. Jeff (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) has murdered his wife and taken his two little girls to the woods where he intends to kill them. But he is dispatched by a ghostlike entity. Fast-forward five years to when Victoria (Megan Charpentier) and her little sister Lilly (Isabelle Nelisse) are found filthy and feral. Eventually theyre taken in by Jeffs slacker brother Lucas (also played by Coster-Waldau) and his rock bassist girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain in Goth drag). But what Lucas and Annabel dont know -- although we unfortunately already do -- is that the girls come with their own phantasmagoric nanny. ""A ghost is an emotion"" as one minor character tells us ""bent out of shape condemned to repeat itself time and time again until it rights the wrong it was done."" Thats a pretty thought isnt it? Its also a bunch of hooey. In ""Mama"" a ghost isnt an emotion but a creepy gray-skinned woman with hair like Medusa who lives in the walls and whose presence is signaled by the arrival of dozens of black moths. Why moths? Because theyre gross and scary of course. (Theres even a word for the fear of them mottephobia.) Sure the movie tries to vague things up a bit. A child psychologist (Daniel Kash) suggests that Mama might not actually exist but is a dissociative projection of the older girl. But every time he or someone else in the film hints that Mama -- who harbors a murderous jealousy of Lucas and Annabel -- might be something other than an actual factual bogeyman the film reminds us that shes very very real. And admittedly she is pretty creepy. Presumably guided by executive producer Guillermo del Toro (""Pans Labyrinth"") director Andres Muschietti has created a real monster in Mama. But the only real mystery in the story (written by Muschietti with his sister Barbara and Neil Cross based on the directors 2008 short of the same name) isnt whether Mama exists what she wants or who she is but why on earth Victoria and Lilly are so fond of this freak show. As they scamper around their new home the girls treat Mama -- who keeps popping out of the wall to play with them -- like shes Mother of the Year when she looks like the Mummy and acts like Medea. If any of this sounds stupid so far just wait for the ending.

Johnson kjohnsonpost-dispatch.com 314-340-8191 Kevin C. Johnson Jan 17 2013 (...) Savvy moviegoers know to be wary of any flick that opens in January when Hollywood dumps much of its trash while focusing on its more prestigious Oscar bait.That casts a bit of suspicion on ""Mama"" a creep-out starring none other than Jessica Chastain just nominated for an Oscar for ""Zero Dark Thirty."" Its release now looks like a studio trying to capitalize on a suddenly hot star the same way Jennifer Lawrences ""The Hunger Games"" was unfortunately followed by ""House at the End of the Street.""But new A-lister Chastain loses no ground with ""Mama."" Executive produced by Guillermo del Toro attracted to the film after seeing a YouTube short he calls one of scariest scenes he has ever seen ""Mama"" is neatly yet scarily concocted by newbie director Andres Muschietti.""Mama"" opens with a distraught father having just killed his wife leading young daughters Victoria and Lilly into a cabin in the woods (no not that one) where he plans to kill them too.There Victoria says she sees a woman standing outside whos ""not touching the floor.""Just as hes about to pull the trigger on Victoria an apparition takes him away sparing the girls who are from then on presumed missing.Five years later Victoria (Megan Charpentier) and Lilly (Isabelle Nelisse) are found living in dark surviving on nothing but cherries and moving around on all fours like animals. What has helped keep the girls alive supposedly is the overseeing titular character.The girls artist uncle Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) and his rocker girlfriend Annabel (Chastain) uproot their lives to take care of the girls. Lilly in particular is a real challenge as she makes minimal strides in adjusting to normal life preferring to sleep under the bed and eat moths. Its not long before director Muschietti lets the audience not to mention the couple in on the fact that the girls apparently brought something back from the cabin with them. And she seems none too happy.Once Lucas is put out of the way in a jarring scene Annabel takes charge. Dr. Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash) tries to get to the bottom of this Mama person Victoria constantly refers to. And pushy aunt Jean (Jane Moffat also the voice of Mama) tries to claim the girls unaware of what shes in for.The finale is heavy on CGI. But it never takes away from this respectable entry into the horror genre that values chills over kills.What ""Mama""  Three stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 140  Content Violence and terror some disturbing images and thematic elements Kevin C.

But ""Mama"" mines that idea with considerable grace and more than a few chilly glissandos. At least until the third act (the point where admittedly so many ambitiously refined horror movies tend to fall apart) the picture skims along on a pleasing current of unease - and it also features a surprisingly relaxed performance from ubiquitous superactress Jessica Chastain. ""Mama"" which Muschietti adapted from a short film he made in 2008 opens in the aftermath of a single grim act just as a second and even more horrific one is about to take place. A clearly distraught father (played by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau from ""Game of Thrones"") herds his two young daughters aged 3 and 1 into the car and begins speeding along a curvy treacherous mountain highway. The car swerves off the road and tumbles down a hill; father and daughters survive and make their way toward an abandoned house deep in the woods a ramshackle cabin appointed with midcentury modern furnishings that clearly havent seen use since the midcentury. The father we learn has gone berserk after taking a financial hit. Hes already murdered the girls mother (the act is referenced but never seen) and now intends to take his daughters lives and then his own. But a spindly shadowy figure -- presumably the inhabitant of this foreboding little cabin -- intervenes cracking his spine in a ghostly half-glimpsed ju-jitsu move. Jump forward five years and the girls whereabouts are finally discovered by a rather inept search party employed by their uncle Lucas (also played by Coster-Waldau) who has been desperate to find them. Having survived all that time with no human contact the girls are like little forest creatures somewhere between the wolf boy of Francois Truffauts ""The Wild Child"" and the preverbal Helen Keller of ""The Miracle Worker."" Naturally Lucas vows to adopt them and while his wanna-be rocker girlfriend Annabel (Chastain in a sleek dark Joan Jett bob) has her doubts about being a mom she stands by her man. The older of the two girls Victoria (Megan Charpentier) is somewhat redeemable remembering enough about her old life to adjust to the comfy suburban upbringing that Annabelle and Lucas hope to provide for them. But Lilly (Isabelle Nelisse) is a spidery little creeper and she cant shake her attachment to a remnant of their woodland life a possibly illusory figure the two sisters refer to as ""Mama."" Mama has provided the tots with some scary-looking dolls made of twigs just one example of the atmospheric touches Muschietti is so skillful at layering. (The script is by Muschietti Neil Cross and Barbara Muschietti and the movie was produced by Guillermo del Toro - it bears earmarks of his intelligent half-dreamy half-spooky view of childhood.) ""Mama"" is one of those pictures that holds you aloft on its vaporous mood of dread - the occasional silliness of the plot mechanics dont matter so much. (Also animal lovers will also want to heed this important public service announcement Nothing bad happens to the dog.) The picture falters only in the last third when the visuals become far too direct and obvious - the things you dont see are always so much scarier than the things you do and ""Mama"" makes the mistake of spelling things out that were better left unseen. To its credit though the movie has enough conviction to go for a not-so-happy ending. And even if at this point youre a little sick of Golden Globe winner and all-around critics prize hogger Chastain shes refreshingly casual and low-key in ""Mama"" believable even as a tattooed bassist in an amateur (and pretty lousy) rock band. Annabels feelings for her two strange young charges - which shift from resigned ambivalence to unsentimental protectiveness - play out believably and gracefully in Chastains body language and in her eyes. Maybe Chastain is so good here because she doesnt clamp down on the role Theres nothing actressy or overstudied about what she does no evidence of a young performer striving to prove herself. In fact this seemingly throwaway performance has more contours than the one she gives in Kathryn Bigelows generally stunning ""Zero Dark Thirty"" With the exception of the last scene in that movie her characterization of an ambitious young CIA agent suffers from a peculiar emotional vagueness. In ""Mama"" a picture that isnt going to win Chastain any awards shes both more specific and subtler. This is a picture about how a mothers love can be nourishing at its best but suffocating in the extreme. Chastain embraces that idea wholly without squeezing the life out of it.

And its not. But neither is it ""Pans Labyrinth"" (2006) the producer-directors brilliant politically aware gothic fairytale. ""Mama"" is a fitfully involving supernatural tale of parents and parental figures both good and bad.  The feature film debut of director-co writer Andres Muschietti it opens with a distraught and possibly criminal father (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) grabbing his two young daughters and driving with them deep into the wintery woods in the Northwest. He leads the girls on foot to an isolated cabin where soon after their arrival a large black-clad apparition swoops down and carries Dad off. Boo-ya indeed. Flash forward to five years later. The girls are discovered living alone in squalor in the cabin. They are turned over to the care of their loving uncle Lucas (also played by Coster-Waldau) and his goth girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain) who plays in a rock band. The children who seemingly have raised themselves are feral little creatures skittering around on all fours and greedily shoving hunks of food into their mouths with their hands. The older one hints to Luke and Annabel as well as to Dr. Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash) the shrink whos overseeing their reentry into civilization that someone she calls ""Mama"" cared for them during their time at the cabin. The little one keeps pining and calling for this mysterious ""Mama."" Mama indeed exists though in spectral form and she soon shows up at Lucas and Annabels house.  Whether shes a threat to the girls or to their new guardians or to both isnt clear at first though its soon obvious she is no benign presence. Trotting out tropes familiar from scores of previous horror films -- including squeaky doors and hinges creaking floor boards mysteriously open windows and visits to a long shuttered nearby mental asylum -- ""Mama"" attempts to ratchet up the suspense about Mamas origins and intentions. Running on a parallel track is the story of Annabels own growing maternal feelings for the girls and her fear that a mysterious creature may be threatening the siblings. What will happen if the two Mamas meet and which of them will the sisters choose? Annabels budding relationship with the girls and near the end the answer to those questions turn out to be by far the most affecting and effective parts of ""Mama."" The rest is often clanking by-the-numbers suspense stuff though sometimes leavened with a sense of humor (as in how Annabel always seems just to miss seeing the kids flying about a room or a ghostly Mama lurking in a closet.) The Oscar-nominated Chastain sports a short dark do tattoos and heavy eye-liner here. She has been far better elsewhere though its not as if she has a lot to work with here other than to look frustrated or fearful. Her performance as Annabel while adequate fails to flesh out what feels like a woefully underwritten character. Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nelisse playing the two young sisters prove themselves solid little actresses with Nelisse in particular displaying a disquietingly sly wit. She has a way of looking disdainfully at adults that makes it clear shes in on a joke or Mamas ghostly presence and the grownups are so so not. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A young couple adopts two mysterious children and perhaps a third entity. Rated PG-13 (gruesome imagery) BOTTOM LINE A surprisingly effective ghost story thanks to strong emotional undercurrents and a sharp smart performance from a pre-fame Chastain. CAST Jessica Chastain Nikolaj Coster-Waldau Megan Charpentier LENGTH 149 There are two reasons to recommend ""Mama"" a horror film that only looks like the usual fare. One is a pre-fame Jessica Chastain cast before her Oscar nods for ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""The Help"" as Annabel a punk-rock bassist suddenly saddled with two little girls. The other is producer Guillermo Del Toro (""Pans Labyrinth"") a filmmaker whose brand of the macabre is always invested with emotion. Both make ""Mama"" more effective than you might expect. Directed by Andy Muschietti from his 2008 short ""Mama"" begins with a nifty premise. Five years after vanishing sisters Victoria and Lilly (Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nelisse both wonderful) are discovered in a cabin in the western Pennsylvania woods filthy feral and nearly unable to speak. Its unclear how they survived but their uncle Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau HBOs ""Game of Thrones"") is determined to fight for custody.

LIer preps for next Americas Got Talent He wins but a freak accident soon lands him in the hospital leaving prickly Annabel to care for the snarling little raccoons. ""I didnt even get the chance to screw them up"" Annabel says to a friend. ""They came that way."" Despite her tattoos and dyed-black hair Annabel slowly bonds with Victoria and at least tries to tame the wild Lilly. The relationship among these three turns out to be a genuine heart-tugger though ""Mama"" is also a creepy-crawler Someone or something was indeed looking after the girls and apparently still is. ""Mama"" isnt entirely original -- horrormeisters enough with the moth symbolism -- but there are plenty of fresh ideas to compensate. Muschiettis camerawork is hugely entertaining (watch for a devilishly clever split screen) and the films central specter is good n freaky (actor Javier Botet a 7-foot-tall Spanish beanpole served as the model). As for the gripping climax Del Toros fingerprints fortunately are all over it. MoviesOur critics top 20 favorite movies PLOT A young couple adopts two mysterious children and perhaps a third entity.

A drug cartel leader busts out of a courthouse and speeds to the Mexican border where the only thing in his path is a sheriff (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his inexperienced staff. (Photo/Video Lionsgate) By Joe Morgenstern Updated Jan. 17 2013 612 p.m. ET First he was the Terminator then the Governator. Now Arnold Schwarzenegger has cast himself as the Rejuvenator breathing huffs and puffs of new life into his screen career. Much of ""The Last Stand"" is a wheezy setup for an enjoyably preposterous showdown in a sleepy Arizona border town called Sommerton Junction. Thats where the sheriff Mr. Schwarzeneggers Ray Owens represents this nations last hope of stopping its most-wanted fugitive a Mexican drug-cartel kingpin who is driving toward the border at barely subsonic speeds. The main source of dramatic energy is the fugitives ride a modified Corvette with a 1000-horsepower engine. Still the movie comes up with a couple of tender moments that could pass for human and a mano-a-mano climax in which the superhero of yore the glint in his eye dulled but not extinguished functions as a weirdly touching tyrannosaurus. ENLARGE Arnold Schwarzenegger Lionsgate In celebration of Arnold Schwarzeneggers return to the big screen in a starring role with Lionsgates ""The Last Stand"" here are some of our favorite Arnold one-liners from over the years. (Photo Columbia Pictures) The best way to see this munitions-intensive action adventure if you must see it at all is in the context of a shrewd commercial enterprise. The production is far from lavish. Sequences play out in sub-TV settings; even Las Vegas where the villain Gabriel Cortez ( Eduardo Noriega) escapes from his FBI captors has more than its share of empty streets and blank walls. That said the action component pays off with ritual car chases (in the context of product placements they come down to the black Vette versus a red Chevy Camaro); heavy weaponry such as a World War II Vickers machine gun from a historical-weapons museum that happens to be situated in Sommerton Junctions sandy outskirts and a reasonably buoyant spirit that pits the drug lord Goliath with his small army of tactical support troops against Mr. Schwarzeneggers long-in-the-tooth David. ""The Last Stand"" marks the English-language debut of the Korean director Kim Jee-woon whose eye for graphic action is more reliable than his ear for English nuance; the ponderous pacing of dialogue scenes and the frequency of barely audible lines suggest that the actors were on their own. But the movie isnt about eloquence its about giving Mr. Schwarzenegger a chance to take on new enemies that include advancing age. Johnny Knoxville is likable as the goofy proprietor of the weapons museum and the script provides such agreeably sententious nonsense as the kingpins comment to a terrified hostage in the passenger seat when he puts the Corvettes pedal to the metal. ""Death"" he tells her ""is waiting in the kitchen when you get up at night for a glass of milk."" Watch a clip from the film ""Mama."" Annabel (Jessica Chastain) and Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) are faced with the challenge of raising his young nieces that were left alone in the forest for 5 years. But how alone were they? (Photo/Video Universal) Mama The Mama of this supernatural thriller is not your average nurturer while ""Mama"" itself is above average as a piece of filmmaking even if its scare quotient is middling or below. Thats OK with me. I was content to be impressed by the skill of the first-time director Andres Muschietti; absorbed by the performances and smitten by some startling images. Its also OK that several characters keep asking one another if theyre OK. This gets to be a running gag in a film where no one is OK for a single moment--not young Victoria or younger Lilly two feral sisters who may have spent the last five years alone in a cabin in the woods; not their uncle Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) who must now help care for them and certainly not Lucass wife Annabel a Goth rocker who becomes the childrens primary caregiver then finds herself engulfed by gothic horror. ENLARGE Megan Charpentier Universal Pictures ENLARGE Jessica Chastain Universal Pictures Annabel is played by Jessica Chastain though you might not know it at first thanks to her mop of black hair and abundant tattoos. Its no stretch to see a commonality between this no-nonsense bass player and Maya Ms. Chastains CIA operative in ""Zero Dark Thirty."" Like Maya Annabel combines fear with steely courage. She needs as much of the latter as she can summon up when Megan Charpentiers Victoria wide eyes peering out from behind wire spectacles and Isabelle Nelisses Lilly scuttling around on all fours turn out to have some sort of protean and wildly possessive guardian they choose to call Mama. ""Mama"" was produced by Guillermo del Toro the masterly Mexican director of such action fantasies as ""Mimic"" ""Hellboy"" and the memorably lyrical ""Pans Labyrinth."" This films Argentine director Mr. Muschietti wrote the script with his sister Barbara and Neil Cross; its an expansion of a surreal short that can be seen on YouTube. At times Mr. Muschietti seems to be the cinematic equivalent of an art student learning from the masters by copying them. Many of his tropes will be familiar to Mr. del Toros fans of whom I am one the difference being that the storytelling here can be confusing and the supernatural threat manifests itself in so many differing forms as to be diffuse and in horror terms defused. All the same ""Mama"" announces the arrival of a director who works unusually well with actors--the two children are truly scary--and who creates highly charged environments effective sound designs and powerful fantasy sequences. One irresistible parallel is not to Mr. del Toros work but to Francois Truffauts transcendently beautiful ""The Wild Child"" in which Truffaut himself played Dr. Itard the physician who undertook to civilize a feral boy discovered in the forests of 18th-century France. The doctor in ""Mama"" played by Daniel Kash is a psychologist and a shameless hustler. Academics can be feral too. --J.M. Watch a clip from the film ""Broken City."" Ex-cop Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg) seeks redemption and revenge after being double-crossed and then framed by its most powerful figure Mayor Nicholas Hostetler (Russell Crowe). (Photo/Video Fox) Broken City Theres no joy in the city of the title which isnt Mudville but a contemporary version of Sam Spades Manhattan tainted by the moral murk of Gotham City. The only reason to see this dreary parade of deception and venality is Mark Wahlbergs performance as a disgraced ex-cop caught up in the thick of menacing events he cant understand. Its striking how this tightly focused actor can find his own firmly grounded reality in the falsest of surroundings. ENLARGE Mark Wahlberg Twentieth Century Fox The film was directed lugubriously by Allen Hughes from a script that Brian Tucker recycled from livelier sources--the films of Sidney Lumet leap to mind. Mr. Wahlbergs Billy Taggart now a private eye struggling to make a living is retained by Mayor Hostetler a smug popinjay played by Russell Crowe. Billys task is to find out who the mayors wife Cathleen is sleeping with; shes played by Catherine Zeta-Jones who seems slightly disconsolate and no wonder. But Billys fate is to be used and confused by everyone around him including the citys police commissioner Carl Fairbanks; hes played by Jeffrey Wright who gives his character a nicely menacing ambiguity. The only source of genuine vitality is Alona Tal bright and appealing in the role of Billys adoring secretary and ad hoc bookkeeper. But Ms. Tals role lies between small and tiny and a whole chunk of it is devoted to a discussion of accounts receivable. --J.M. DVD Focus ENLARGE Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines Warner Bros./Everett Collection Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines (2003) Arnold Schwarzeneggers guardian robot is back with his vast chest and freeze-dried visage to protect mankinds young savior-to-be John Connor who is played in this go-round by Nick Stahl. This Terminator lets it be known that hes an obsolete design. Kristanna Lokens killer robot T-X is not obsolete; shes drop-dead beautiful and mesmerizing. And so in her way is Claire Danes as Johns reluctant accomplice a veterinarian named Kate Brewster. ""T3"" was directed not by James Cameron but by Jonathan Mostow. While it lacks the elegance of its predecessors its an efficient entertainment at the very least. ENLARGE The Devils Backbone The Devils Backbone (2001) Of the many striking images in Guillermo del Toros dark and absorbing horror film the most memorable is the starkest--an unexploded bomb that stands like the black slab in ""2001"" in the arid courtyard of a Spanish orphanage. The time is the late 1930s. Inside the orphanage which shelters children of Republican fighters and politicians the pale ghost of a young student named Santi wanders the grounds. Outside civil war rages; thats a horror story in itself. This is a horror flick that also functions as an allegory of the war that still haunts Spain eight decades later. ENLARGE Three Kings Three Kings (1999) With Mark Wahlberg making ""Broken City"" look better than it is and David O. Russells ""Silver Linings Playbook"" up for multiple Oscars the time has come to remind you once again of Mr. Russells action adventure set in the poisonous aftermath of the first Gulf War. A visionary film that leaves you elated and agog its pandemonium with a moral purpose. Mr. Wahlberg is Sgt. Troy Barlow one of three soldiers enlisted by George Clooneys Capt. Archie Gates to liberate tons of gold bullion stolen from Kuwait. The other two are played con brio by Ice Cube and Spike Jonze. --J.M. 5 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Jason Bourne Whats Happened So Far?

Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Universal Pictures Mama Director Andres Muschietti Genre Horror Running Time 100 minutes Rated PG-13 for violence and terror some disturbing images and thematic elements With Jessica Chastain Nikolaj Coster-Waldau Daniel Kash Watch Clips Watch a Clip from Mama- Kitchen Kitchen Credit Universal Pictures Watch a Clip from Mama - Im Not Your Mom Im Not Your Mom Credit Universal Pictures If the movies have taught us anything its that when youre lost in the wilderness an abandoned cabin in the woods may not be the life-sustaining shelter it seems. In the opening sequence of Mama a car accident leaves Jeffrey (Game of Thrones Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) and his daughters stranded in the snow. They happen upon just such a cabin and he eagerly takes them inside and starts a fire. But apparently hes never seen a slasher pic so hes unprepared for the inevitable danger -- and of course hes murdered in due time by the spirit who lives in the cabins walls. Meet ""Mama"" who raises Jeffreys girls Victoria and Lilly as near-feral beasts. Theyll be recovered five years later through the continued search efforts of Lucas Jeffreys identical twin brother. Lucas and his girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain) take on the task of caring for the barely verbal children who hide under beds and skitter around the room like human ghost crabs fleeing a flashlight on the beach. Theyre aided by a psychologist Dr. Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash) whos ostensibly there to help ease the girls reassimilation into polite society. Given the girls stunted development that wouldnt be an easy task even with experienced willing parents -- and Annabel reluctant to give up her rock n roll lifestyle for instant parenting has some distance to go to connect with her maternal instincts. Things are also complicated by the fact that Mama has followed the girls back to civilization and is jealous of the competition. When he took the girls into Mamas lair Jeffrey may have ignored the storytelling conventions at play but audiences will recognize them immediately -- and they go far beyond just the cabin in the woods. First-time feature director Andres Muschietti stuffs a host of traditions from cinema and folklore into Mama and sets the blender to liquefy. The kids being left in the woods to fend for themselves with a malevolent caretaker recalls ""Hansel and Gretel"" and you can take your pick of other stories involving children raised in the wild from Romulus and Remus to Mowgli. Lilly and Victoria provide a haunting presence at the heart of Mama a horror film backed by executive producer Guillermo del Toro. Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Universal Pictures The family psychologist with nefarious motives is but one element from Cronenbergs 1979 classic The Brood while the secret behind Mamas attachment to the children is straight out of The Woman in Black. The moth motifs of The Silence of the Lambs come into play and the swelling music and familial drama of the climax wouldnt be out of place in early Spielberg. Muschietti even visually quotes Kubricks The Shining right out of the gate with a helicopter shot of a car making its way along twisting mountain roads. Surprisingly this patchwork pastiche often works. The director maintains the somber chilly tone of 70s horror which serves to unify all those disparate influences and also helps distract from the often highly questionable decision-making of the characters (another horror hallmark Muschietti doesnt neglect). Lets just say youll spend a lot of time thinking to yourself ""Dont go in there"" or ""Why would he go and investigate that place at night alone without telling anyone where hes going?"" The contrivances can be eye-rolling but as a part of a celebration of the films sometimes cheesy influences theyre marginally excusable. What more often sinks Mama is well Mama herself. Much like another recent homage to a spookier era of horror 2011s Dont Be Afraid of the Dark -- which like Mama was executive-produced by Guillermo del Toro -- Muschiettis film shows its monster too early and too often. When shes slithering around in the shadows Mama has the power to make every hair on your spine prickle. But when shes sitting still out in the open her digital construction seems all too apparent -- and more silly than frightening. The films climactic scene drags out longer than it should anyway but even more so given that so much of it relies on her unconvincing figure dominating the frame. When Mama works its because of its flesh-and-blood maternal figure. Annabel is the films foundation and true to her growing reputation as one of the most committed actors in Hollywood Chastain throws herself into this material as convincingly as in her Oscar-nominated turn in Zero Dark Thirty. Her journey to find the ""Mama"" in herself might be as conventional as the other spare parts Muschietti has cobbled together -- but then when theyre delivered this artfully its clear why those conventions exist in the first place.

Slideshow Mama Every adoptive parents nightmare Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Mama >> An effectively spooky ghost story with Guillermo del Toros imprimatur (hes executive producer) Mama is every adoptive parents nightmare What if the children you bring home start eating moths and toilet paper and wont come out from under the bed? And when they do its only to do something hurtful? Directed by Andy Muschietti a maker of commercials in Spain and vastly expanded from a three-minute short he and his sister made five years ago (you can find it on YouTube) Mama is skillfully assembled and cast with a better caliber of actor than this tried-and-true scare fare typically attracts. Chastain up for an Oscar for her work as an obsessed CIA officer in Zero Dark Thirty anchors the film as Annabel the bassist in an all-girl band. She lives with Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) a freelance illustrator. Kids are the last thing these two want. But five years earlier in a chilling pre-titles sequence Lucas brother Jeffrey (also Coster-Waldau) went postal killing co-workers and killing his wife. He takes his daughters and heads for the snowy woods and to a cabin marked ""Helvecia."" The house furnished in midcentury modern thats to die for fronts onto a lake. If it werent for the rats the strange stains on the walls and the creepily double-jointed wraithlike figure with the long flowing hair and the fingers like tree branches itd be an idyllic place to hide. As it turns out this creature - first seen in shadowy nano-second shots - is Muschiettis title character. Hers is a long and winding backstory with stops at a Victorian-era insane asylum but ever since Victoria (Megan Charpentier) and Lilly (Isabelle Nelisse) arrived at the cabin she has been like a mother to the girls feeding them cherries and apparently feeding them a lot of dark stuff about life. If anyone ever found the sisters and pried them away this intensely possessive mom would certainly be upset. Which is what happens when trackers do finally find the girls and Annabel and Lucas win custody. Yes theres a psychiatrist (Daniel Kash) whos convinced the sisters have invented this ""imaginary guardian."" And yes theres a family member (Jane Moffat) competing for custody rights. And when Lucas injures himself - a fall down the stairs a coma - it is Annabel who is left to fend for herself and left to figure out how to connect with these sinister siblings. Like another del Toro stamp-of-approval Spanish horror entry The Orphanage Muschiettis Mama is full of arty tropes - sepia-toned flashbacks flickering lights menacing murmurings. The atmosphere is positively spectral. And its easy to see why del Toro is a champion Like his Pans Labyrinth theres a fairy-tale aspect (the film even begins with the title card ""Once upon a time . . . "") with children in jeopardy a witchy monster and edge-of-the-precipice confrontations. In the end if it isnt all a dream its maybe kind of a joke. And the filmmakers have been forced to do what they so expertly didnt do for most of the movie linger on the digitally rendered title creature all pliable and anorexic with eyes that are big and sad but dont look real at all.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> You know something is up when what looks like a cheapie fright flick is produced by Guillermo Del Toro (Pans Labyrinth) and boasts an Oscar-nominated actress in Jessica Chastain (Zero Dark Thirty). Mama doesnt live up to their potential but the film knows how to creep you out. Two sisters Victoria (Megan Charpentier) and Lilly (Isabelle Nelisse) considered dead for five years are found in the wilderness. The feral girls are taken in by their uncle Lucas (Game of Thrones Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) and his raven-haired girlfriend Annabel (Chastain) who try to solve the mystery of how they survived and why they still seem to be haunted by a menacing ghost they call ""Mama."" Time now for me to shut up. To get a taste of the films eerie essence check out the acclaimed short of the same title (its on YouTube) that director Andres Muschietti and his producer sister Barbara crafted in 2008. The feature-length Mama - which Neil Cross (Luther) wrote with the Muschiettis - cant hide its stretch marks. But Chastain digs deep going beyond the call of scream-queen duty to find the passion that gives horror a pulse.

By Kristin Tillotson Star Tribune January 18 2013 -- 1034am  Uinversal Pictures Annabel (Jessica Chastain left) tries to protect two young girls played by Isabelle Nelisse and Megan Charpentier in ""Mama."" Byline Photo Credit George Kraychyk Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Gore is boring. So much chainsaw-massacre splatter has been shoveled movie audiences way weve become inured. ""Mama"" is a smartly refreshing departure a truly scary movie exemplifying horror at its purest. It elicits sudden heart-constricting spasms of fear rather than simply trying to gross us out. And it does so with such finely honed style you could call it ""high creep."" The well-shot flashback beginning portends a good story to come. A father (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) who has just killed his estranged wife speeds into the snowy mountains with his two young daughters. After the car crashes the three stumble upon a seemingly abandoned cabin where a malevolent she-ghost having a permanent bad-hair day makes short work of Dad but takes a motherly shine to the kids. Spring forward five years. The recently discovered feral girls go to live with their artist uncle (also played by Coster-Waldau) and his rock-bassist girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain who should get a special award for range this year). The phantom feeling protective and proprietary toward the girls slithers along for the ride and proceeds to wreak ghastly havoc on the newly formed family when shes not skulking in closets or spitting moths out of walls. Director/co-writer Andres Muschietti keeps the goosebumps coming with unanticipated frissons like the startling way in which the girls spider-crawl on all fours and the ungodly noises spewing from the stringy contorted apparition that is Mama. Her character looks like a special-effects contrivance but is not entirely. Shes played by a male actor (Javier Botet) with a rare condition called Marfan Syndrome an inherited connective-tissue disorder that elongates limbs and makes fingers look like E.T.s. Rather than comfort like the beloved alien though Mamas bone-thin stretched-out digits threaten to crush with possessive obsessive love. MAMA  OUT OF FOUR STARS Rated PG-13 for violence terror disturbing images and thematic elements. Muschietti frightens not only with superb visual effects and expert pacing but by accessing the shame and fears we bury deep in our psyches. What parent hasnt at least once looked at a screaming kicking toddler and thought ""this cant be my darling its a monster""? And what mother hasnt felt such intense love for her children it borders on ferocious? The films executive producer Guillermo del Toro wrote and directed the troubling darkly magical ""Pans Labyrinth."" His imprint is also apparent on ""Mama"" which breaks the same unspoken Hollywood rule Things dont end well for the children at least not both of them. While that might leave some viewers dissatisfied it saves the story from a pat predictable finish. ""Mama"" isnt perfect -- a few head-scratcher plot leaps and loose ends annoy -- but its a relatively sophisticated palate cleanser in an overcrowded derivative genre and scary enough that you might shine a flashlight into your air vents before going to sleep.

(George Kraychyk/Universal/Everett Collection) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS MOVIE CRITIC Updated Thursday January 17 2013 130 PM Title Mama Film Info With Jessica Chastain. Children raised by a ghost bring terror to their uncles girlfriend. Director Andy Muschietti (140). PG-13 Violence. Area theaters. If youre going to have a ghost in your movie it might be a good thing to present a viable alternative to that ghost. ""Mama"" however presents a battle between two not very good options before crumbling like a sheet on a string. In an overly convoluted setup that resonates with the potential for Stephen King-style creepiness a radio announcer reports on an office shooting in which a bad stock turn caused an employee to kill three people. We then see the shooter return home to his daughters ages 3 and 1. He puts the girls in the car and takes off on an icy mountain road. Careening off a cliffside the car is wrecked and the three stumble out to find a spooky hovel nestled in the woods. Dad winds up leaving but the little girls stay and are found five years later by their uncle Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau). The children are feral and frightening scuttling on all fours as they screech and chew on bark. Once the now 8-year-old Victoria (Megan Charpentier) and her 6-year-old sister Lily (Isabelle Nelisse) get to a psychiatrist (Daniel Kash) who sees them as a potential ticket to fame Uncle Lucas introduces the cleaned-up kids to his girlfriend Annabel (""Zero Dark Thirty"" Oscar nominee Jessica Chastain). Annabel is a tattooed punkster who plays in a band and wants nothing to do with kids. So when two show up out of nowhere Annabel scowls through her raccoon eye shadow. But it gets worse. Turns out the girls were raised in the cabin by a ghost they call Mama who floats ethereally on the air and tends to go into and out of walls accompanied by butterflies. As the shrink gets closer to discovering who Mama was Annabel is about to face some tough love. Thats a lot of plot just to get to the point we know ""Mama"" is heading toward a showdown between maternal instincts. There are other tangents. Dreams reveal messages from the dead and there are several visits to a dusty library. Expect too the usual household ""accidents"" which kill time as director Andy Muschietti adds shocking cuts and screeching sound effects. Thats unnecessary since the minimal beauty in ""Mama"" is in the tickling way the ghouly title character flits around the edge of the screen never here nor there. But a little of that goes a long way. Unfortunately Annabel isnt exactly a pleasant haven for Victoria or Lily to run to. Played by Chastain with a snarky sneer and a dark wig the actress whos given such varied turns in the last two years seems to be slumming. Shes not of course. Chastain is just left hanging in ""Mama"" a victim of a bulky plot and in danger of being the lesser of two evils. Magic moment Mama crawls along the floor thanks to the usefulness of elongated limbs.

Now everyone really will know her name By Mary Pols MaryPolsJan. 17 2013 Share Read Later Universal Pictures Mama Year 2013 Director Andres Muschietti Studio Universal Pictures Actors Jessica Chastain Nikolaj Coster-Waldau Megan Charpentier Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture A few weeks from now Zero Dark Thirtys Jessica Chastain is highly likely to win an Academy Award for Best Actress (shes the favorite at this point). At the Golden Globes when she accepted an award for her work as a CIA operative hunting Osama bin Laden she was gracious genuine and humble. Shes on top of the world and nothing not even appearing in a new release shes way too good for the horror flick Mama can bring her down. Mama is clumsily written and choppily edited but Chastain doesnt have a bad scene in it and you can see why she chose to be in this supernatural ghost story. Not only did it come with the blessing of Pans Labyrinth director Guillermo del Toro who executive-produced but it gave an actress who became famous playing saintly idealized mothers in two 2011 releases -- Terrence Malicks The Tree of Life and Take Shelter (as well as a woman desperate to be a mother in The Help) -- a chance to play against type. In Mama she is Annabel a tough-talking guitarist in a lousy rock band whose first act in the movie is to celebrate a negative pregnancy test with her boyfriend Lucas (Game of Thrones Nikolaj Coster-Waldau). Annabels hair is spiky her eyes ringed with makeup her jeans deliberately distressed. Shes the antithesis of a soccer mom. (MORE Jessica Chastain on Playing the Girl Who Got bin Laden) But through strange and disturbing -- of course -- circumstances the woman who doesnt want children has them foisted on her. And not just any kids but two little girls Victoria (Megan Charpentier) 8 and Lilly (Isabelle Nelisse) 6 Lucas orphaned nieces who have been living as feral creatures in the woods for nearly their entire lives. Dr. Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash) the shrink at the ""institute"" where they are taken after being found filthy starved and barely verbal (although they say ""Mama"" a lot) assures Annabel and Lucas that they are likely to readjust. But meanwhile hes practically drooling over the research possibilities. In Mama institute is -- as so often the case in movies -- a totally dirty word. The backstory is that Lucas brother Jeff (also played by Coster-Waldau) distraught over the economy killed two colleagues and his estranged wife then ran off with his daughters who were 3 and 1 at the time. They end up in an abandoned cabin filled with rats and a spectral presence who resembles a tall bundle of kelp moss and sticks sort of a floating East Coast version of tumbleweed (blame Blair Witch for horrors obsession with sticks). ""Daddy theres a woman outside"" the younger version of Victoria says. ""Shes not touching the floor."" Director Andres Muschietti co-wrote the script with his sister Barbara expanding on his earlier Spanish-language short with the same title and you feel a feminine and perhaps even feminist hand at work which gives the movie a spark and intrigue that lingers even in the face of the usual horror tropes. The stick creature who materializes from the walls like a particularly nasty case of mold is not earth-bound but she is maternal and the audience is likely to give a cheer for her first protective act toward the girls an angry retort to the arrogance of a coward with a gun. Mama is not all bad even if the diet she provides the children with -- nothing but cherries and moths -- is not exactly balanced. (VIDEO Jessica Chastain on Her Love of Acting and Her Work in The Help) How does ghostly tumbleweed have access to cherries anyway? And why did the children resort to walking on all fours -- a habit Lilly cant totally break even when she returns to civilization -- when Mama herself in the gleefully spooky glimpses we get of her appears to be a towering two-legged presence? Is it because crawling feral children speak to the modern parents nightmare of a child who misses the pediatricians milestones? Certainly the images of weird little Lilly scooting around on all fours are some of the creepiest in the movie. Theres definitely something bold in this story which raises the issues of societal longing for children and what its like to be outside that longing like Annabel is as well as the possibility that some children are too difficult to handle. Lilly is to put it mildly a handful with some very disturbing habits. But those ideas are fairly well buried under a heap of trite actions (no one will pity the characters who time their arrival at the scary cabin for nightfall) and absurdly timed bits of exposition (""Its very likely this coma is temporary"" a doctor says at one point assuring us this character will have a second act). Even while hes letting logic lapse hither and yon Muschietti answers too many of his mysteries. Theres little left for the audience to figure out; the origins of Mama herself are handed to us on a silver platter (well to be more precise in various files or dream sequences). The scenes leading up to the climax are rushed edited as if with a hacksaw but the ending itself with Chastain the fierce heroine has some power. Mama wont hurt this rising star. It will just introduce her to a wider audience the one that has no patience for Malick or slow-moving CIA manhunts.
