FRIDAYS GUIDE TO MOVIES amp; MUSIC. Siskels Flicks Picks.Wisecracking Nicolas Cage Saves Hyperactive Thriller `The RockJune 07 1996|By Gene Siskel.Our Flick of the Week is ""The Rock"" a hyperactive thriller that plays like ""Speed"" on speed. By comparison ""Mission Impossible"" is paced like a film by Jean Renoir. There isnt a shot scene or sequence in ""The Rock"" that doesnt move furiously typically with colored lights flashing into our faces or onto those of the actors. The phrase ""all frosting and no cake"" comes to mind.Except there is some cake in ""The Rock."" About an hour into this fortress adventure story the always-fresh Nicolas Cage takes over the plot and begins some witty often outrageous repartee with Sean Connery. Even though Cages character is an explosives expert for the FBI he plays the ""average guy"" to Sean Connerys veteran warrior the only prisoner ever to escape from Alcatraz known as ""The Rock."""");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""300"" height=""160""gt;What brings Connery back is an absurd premise triggered by Ed Harris playing a much-decorated Vietnam War hero who is disgusted with the way our government ignores the families of soldiers who die in covert operations.What does the humanistic Harris do? Call the San Francisco Chronicle Montel Williams or Larry King? Nope. He concocts a deadly kidnapping-and-bombing plot. Using a team of elite commandos he locks a bunch of tourists inside Alcatraz cells and aims warheads full of deadly nerve gas at downtown San Francisco. Either the government pays reparations to the dead soldiers families (and salaries to Harris cohorts) or its bombs away. Suddenly the ""Rambo"" films seem reasonable.""The Rock"" is the last production of the late Don Simpson and his partner Jerry Bruckheimer who were responsible for frenetic films such as ""Top Gun"" and ""Days of Thunder."" The pacing of ""The Rock"" is like highlights of both.But the antidote to this testosterone team is Cage. During the past Oscar season he told me his next couple of films would be big-budget action pictures and the reason he made them was in part to allow his commercialism to green-light more adventurous independent films.""I also want to bring a more risk-taking acting style to these pictures"" Cage said. And that he has in ""The Rock."" He cracks wise throughout the third act and is almost entertaining enough to make this absurdly energetic movie recommendable.Almost. Rated R.

Directed by Michael Bay from a script by David Weisberg Douglas S. Cook and Mark Rosner. Alderwood Bella Bottega 7 Broadway Market Chalet Crossroads Everett Mall Factoria Gateway Issaquah 9 Kent 6 Lewis amp; Clark Metro Mountlake 9 Oak Tree Puyallup 6 Valley drive-in. ""R"" - Restricted because of violence and language. You might need to take Dramamine before entering a Michael Bay movie. The one-time music-video director has an annoying habit of finding the tightest shots editing the heck out of them and scoring the works to loud music. He never met a moving camera he didnt like. As with his debut ""Bad Boys"" Bay keeps this 131-minute action film moving right along. If you like exploding hardware violent deaths a cacophony of sound and Sean Connery trying to pull Schwarzenegger-like retorts as he dispatches the bad guys has Bay got a movie for you. This final film from the production team of Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson (who died in January) certainly has the energy and professional look of their best action films ""Top Gun"" and last years ""Crimson Tide."" Bay and the writing team of David Weisberg and Douglas S. Cook (whose only credit is the unwatchable ""Holy Matrimony"") have created an action film with a very low ""ooh"" and ""ahh"" factor. On the plausibility meter its far worse than any other Bruckheimer/Simpson action fare. A highly decorated Brigadier General (Ed Harris) takes over Alcatraz Island with 80 hostages and threatens to fire rockets carrying lethal gas into San Francisco. He demands the government pay 100 million in benefits to families of soldiers who lost their lives in covert operations. Enter chemical expert Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage) a desk-job Fed who finds himself in the middle of a Navy SEAL unit attempting to break into the former prison. Leading the way is top secret prisoner Patrick Mason (Sean Connery) who broke out of the famed prison years ago. Mason has his own private agenda with the FBI director (John Spencer) that leads to an escape and an unneeded car chase featuring more flying debris than ""Twister."" ""The Rock"" is a big goofy movie that looks right when we see soldiers in action with their high-tech weapons. Yet the film has too many corny elements including the car chase an Indiana Jones-type railroad sequence and the reappearance of Cages girl-friend (Vanessa Marcil). The same plot of hostages and toxic gas was executed more efficiently earlier this year in ""Executive Decision."" Ed Harris does his usual professional job in a role that is far undercooked. Still an action draw in his mid-60s Sean Connery (who also executive-produced) puts in an acceptable if ordinary performance despite an intriguing character. As some aging action stars are finding roles with more introspection (Clint Eastwood for one) Connery seems satisfied as the cool schoolmaster. There is some nice supporting work from William Forsythe as a Fed and David Morse as Harris right-hand man. Thank goodness for Nicolas Cage. ""The Rock"" is the furthest genre from his heartbreaking Oscar-winning role in ""Leaving Las Vegas."" Cage proves his versatility as the reluctant hero (designed by way of Tom Clancys Jack Ryan character) bringing his comic timing and droll face into perfect pitch. His first scene with Connery is giddy fun. He steals the entire picture. One wonders when Bruckheimer and Simpson stopped caring about the banality of the situation. ""Tide"" was essentially made up of every submarine cliche yet the film stood on its own. ""The Rock"" is a mindless toneless exercise of the blow-em-up school. Theres no thrill in this thriller.

"`Rock Bottom - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Take 2. FRIDAYS GUIDE TO MOVIES amp; MUSIC.`Rock BottomOutlandish Blow-em-up Premise Sinks Alcatraz FilmJune 07 1996|By Michael Wilmington Tribune movie critic.`The Rock"" one of the last Don Simpson-Jerry Bruckheimer action slam-bangers made before Simpsons recent death takes place on Alcatraz. And in this case the high-gloss and whiplash pace contrast explosively with the backdrop the legendary grim fortress among American prisons looming like a concrete Hades on its windswept barren island outside San Francisco.Long abandoned as a correctional facility and now a haven for sea birds and tourists Alcatraz is one of the great American movie locations. Its darkly picturesque and full of menace and foreboding. Thats what movies like the John Boorman-Lee Marvin 1967 ""Point Blank"" which begins and ends on Alcatraz have proved. And thats what ""The Rock"" -- a big splashy thriller about yet another hostage standoff-commando raid operation -- sets out sometimes successfully to exploit.For two hours the moviemakers including director Michael Bay (""Bad Boys"") still another tag-team of writers and a stellar cast headed by Sean Connery Nicolas Cage and Ed Harris keep charging around the island through the prison cells and the network of sewers beneath them. Jail doors clang. Automatic rifles fire and ricochet. Time bombs tick away with red numbers flashing. Fireballs explode and men go crashing through windows dangle from rooftops or thrash helplessly in the sewage.The plot which could be described as ""Die Hard on Alcatraz"" keeps plunging along like a trolley car tumbling and exploding downhill -- an image the moviemakers actually use during their obligatory car chase. Its another outlandish blow-em-up premise done with more cheerful big-movie disregard for logistics probability and fictitious human life.Nobody can say that Bruckheimer and his late partner Don Simpson -- to whom the movie is dedicated -- havent given their all havent delivered everything this genre promises and a little more. And nobody can say that Cage Connery and Harris arent much more entertaining to watch in this kind of movie than 99 percent of the other actors who might have been cast. (What trio would be better? Tom Hanks-Michael Caine-Gene Hackman? Michael Keaton-Anthony Hopkins-Tommy Lee Jones? Billy Crystal-John Cleese-Leslie Nielsen?)Once again an outmatched and outnumbered hero battles the baddies -- in this case self-proclaimed soldier patriots who have commandeered the entire prison and are holding 81 hostages in order to force the American government to compensate the families of men killed in covert actions. Another mad bomber Ed Harris Gen. Francis X. Hummel threatens to decimate San Francisco with missiles containing V.X. poison gas which can strip your flesh off in seven seconds. Another motley undermanned good-guy contingent (Cage and Connery) tries to stop him.Basically thats the story. And if it sounds like ""Die Hard on Alcatraz"" thats probably because the 1988 John McTiernan-Bruce Willis thriller about one man crawling around a high-rise battling terrorists has virtually become an American movie genre. Just as ""Under Siege"" was ""Die Hard on a Battleship"" ""Speed"" was ""Die Hard on a Bus"" and ""Executive Decision"" was ""Die Hard on a Plane"" this movie is ""Die Hard on the Rock.""But there are variations. Alcatraz isnt a high-tech background and ""The Rock"" boasts two underdog heroes Cage as Stanley Goodspeed the Beatles-loving guitar-playing shyly self-deprecating chemical weapons guy and Connery as Patrick Mason an ex-British intelligence officer incarcerated for three decades who happens to be the only man who ever actually escaped from Alcatraz.Since the plot is ridiculous ""The Rock"" works best when its most light-hearted such as when in the midst of mind-boggling carnage Cage makes some nervous wisecrack or Connery arches a wry eyebrow.Cage as he has shown in a dozen striking performances from ""Birdy"" to ""Leaving Las Vegas"" has both keen empathy and a fine dark sense of humor. And Connery at 65 is still heroism personified.But even though they can distract us from the nonsense erupting all around them they cant totally redeem it. As usual the hostages are all but ignored for most of the movie. ""The Rock"" also would like us to believe that Harris Hummel is a noble guy who cracked -- and Harris almost brings it off with another of his great tight-lipped tortured macho performances. But it might have been better if Hummel were a more ordinary villain-nut like Dennis Hopper in ""Speed"" or Sterling Haydens Gen. Jack D. Ripper in ""Dr. Strangelove.""1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesWisecracking Nicolas Cage Saves Hyperactive Thriller `The...June 7 1996Nicollette Sheridan stars as a medical researcher trying...July 7 1996Murky `Just Cause Sentences Itself To Death In The SwampFebruary 17 1995Find More Stories AboutSean ConneryEd HarrisAlcatrazTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-06-07/entertainment/9606070219_1_alcatraz-ed-harris-late-partner-don-simpson,200,therock3,therock,chicagotribune
Its Difficult Not To Knock The Rock - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Sean Connery Its Difficult Not To Knock The RockMovie - Review - The Rock -  - Cast Nicolas Cage Sean Connery Ed Harris. - Director Michael Bay. - Screenwriters David Weisberg Doulgas S. Cook Mark Rosner. - Cinematographer John Schwartzman. - Music Nick Glennie-Smith Hans Zimmer. - Running time 2 hours 15 minutes. - Industry rating R (restricted). - Parents guide Extreme violence extreme profanity adult situations. - Reviewing key  excellent  good  average  poor  awfulExploitation Film Crumbles In A Sea Of PointlessnessJune 7 1996|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticOh thats just about the most awful thing Ive ever seen Nicolas Cage says in The Rock.Hes wincing at the sight of a corpse but he could well have been describing the movie itself.In most ways this brutal exploitation flick is every bit as violent and soulless as say a Jean-Claude Van Damme blastfest. But The Rock (which opens today) has just a drop of finesse and that drop could turn out to be box-office gold.The cast is eminently respectable. Not only is recent Oscar-winner Cage (Leaving Las Vegas) on board so are recent Oscar-nominee Ed Harris (Apollo 13) and Oscar-winner Sean Connery (The Untouchables).They have fun with their roles (especially Cage) and their playfulness helps. But only so much.The title refers to Alcatraz Island a former maximum-security prison that in recent years has become a tourist attraction. The plot concerns what happens when a superpatriot called Gen. Hummel (Harris) and his team of disgruntled commandos seize control of Alcatraz and the 81 tourists who happen to be there at the time.What they want is official government recognition of some Marines who worked on secret missions. They also want millions of dollars.Why do they choose to take over Alcatraz instead of for example taking a bunch of hostages to some secret location? Frankly this was never quite clear to me.Its probably similar to the reason that the bad guys in Van DammesSudden Death (1995) kidnapped the vice president during the seventh game of the Stanley Cup finals in a packed sports arena. That of course was because . . . Come to think of it I was never quite clear about that either.But Sudden Death isnt the only movie The Rock resembles. Director Michael Bay (Bad Boys) and the screenwriters (David Weisberg Doulgas S. Cook and Mark Rosner) steal a little from everywhere including (but not limited to) Die Hard and Lethal Weapon.Of course grabbing ideas from other movies isnt necessarily a crime. What bothers me is that the filmmakers steal without bringing anything fresh to the mix.They just jam it all together with MTV editing and turn the heavy-metal soundtrack up real loud. Its the sort of pummeling style that you would expect from the films producers Jerry Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson whose work includes Flashdance Top Gun and Bad Boys.The Rock is dedicated to Simpson and I would say its a fitting tribute.Stanley Goodspeed the man Cage plays is a biochemist for the FBI. Hes something like the hero of the Red October series - a desk jockey who is suddenly pressed into service as an action hero.As for Connerys character Patrick Mason is a former British spy who was once imprisoned at Alcatraz from which he managed to escape. Mason is like what Connerys James Bond would be like if hed lived behind bars for many years.After Gen. Hummel and his merry paramilitary band take over the island Goodspeed and Mason reluctantly team to break in and free the hostages. If they dont succeed in less than 48 hours Hummel may launch rockets carrying enough chemicals to destroy all life in nearby San Francisco.Early in The Rock theres an almost-pointless Speed-like car chase and later theres a syringe-in-the-heart scene that can only bring to mind Pulp Fiction. Which is not to imply that The Rock is in any way as entertaining as either of those movies.It isnt. And if its not the most awful thing Ive ever seen its close enough to make me wince.

But the real aim is to make a film thats faster than a blink. Bay who directed last years Bad Boys has a background in MTV videos and it shows in The Rocks frenetic pace which speeds the movie past a crazy premise and gaping plotholes.The borrowings from other movies going all the way back to the car chase in 1968s Bullitt are heavy. But Bay has three leads to lend weight and dimension to characters who are hardly original and flatly written. Not surprisingly the chief pleasure of The Rock is Sean Connery who brings his own special brand of world-weary and knowing irony to the action.The Rock rests on two break-ins at Alcatraz. Ed Harris joins a long line of military movie psychos as Gen. Francis Hummel and amazingly he manages to do something with a part that is invariably thankless. Incensed at the governments continuing refusal to compensate the families of men who have died in covert operations Hummel does something to get Washingtons attention. He steals some missiles and deadly gas and recruits some like-minded mutineers from the Marine Corps. Then he commandeers Alcatraz now San Franciscos leading sightseeing attraction and turns it into a real tourist trap by taking 81 visitors hostage.After Hummel points the weapons at San Francisco and demands 100 million from a secret slush fund Connery and Nicolas Cage - an improbable yet enjoyable pairing - are enlisted to join the Navy Seals who will stealthily attempt a counterattack on the island. Cage is stuck with the nerdy scientist role as the nerve-gas expert who has to get up the guts to go on the mission. But he manages the inevitable transition to courage with grace humor and conviction.Connerys John Patrick Mason is an old con who has been in a maximum-security slammer for three decades. He supposedly knows the contents of files that J. Edgar Hoover used to pressure powerful people - information that would still make him a prized commodity on the talk-show circuit if he ever got out.As the last man to escape from Alcatraz Mason is offered the promise of freedom in return for going back to prison. His story and the way the current generation of feds treats him allow The Rock to toss a few stones at the crookedness and depravity of Washington and in the process make Hummel less of an ogre. Hes crazy but honorably so.There is an interlude in San Francisco that is noisy silly and irrelevant but it is soon forgotten when the team begins its perilous assault. The film pivots on two dilemmas. Will Hummel a much-decorated war hero really order a launch and wipe out millions of innocent citizens? Will the President look at the lives at stake in Alcatraz and San Francisco and order an air strike to wipe out the island penitentiary?The way the movie answers the questions does not stand close inspection. But its momentum doesnt leave room for any. The Rock is rightly dedicated to producer Don Simpson who died in January. He could ask for no more fitting monument to the flamboyant and influential style that he and his partner Jerry Bruckheimer brought to action movies.THE ROCK    Produced by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer directed by Michael Bay written by David Weisberg Douglas S.

A tense tale of rebel military officers who take over Alcatraz Island and threaten to unleash rockets on San Francisco unless their demands are met this is a pure popcorn picture that benefits heavily from its trio of highly skilled charismatic leading thesps an unusual setting that provides plenty of visual stimulation and a confrontational standoff that actually stems from a legitimately provocative premise. The yarn has its share of gaping holes and jaw-dropping improbabilities but director Michael Bay sweeps them all aside with his never-take-a-breath pacing that refuses to allow more than a few minutes to go by without some new dilemma that only ac- tion not talk can resolve. Opening stretch is given over to the perpetrator of the dastardly scheme Brig. Gen. Hummel (Ed Harris) a veteran of every U.S. military engagement since Vietnam. Considered a legend and a super-patriot Hummel has overseen dozens of covert operations in which men were lost and has reached his limit with the governments refusal to acknowledge these soldiers contributions or to provide their families with the benefits received by those of other combat victims. He is without question a rebel with a cause and a plausible one at that. But his scheme is off the wall. With an elite unit of like-minded mutineers Hummel absconds with a bunch of rockets loaded with deadly V.X. liquid gas takes 81 hostages from a tour group on Alcatraz and promises to launch the missiles on the Bay area unless Washington forks over  100 million from a secret slush fund within 40 hours. Furthering the conspiratorial air of illegal activities and under-the-radar government shenanigans is the emergence of the only man who can save the day John Patrick Mason (Sean Connery) a former SAS operative who was secretly imprisoned for making off with J. Edgar Hoovers most closely held secrets. He also happens to know Alcatraz better than anyone having successfully escaped from ""the Rock"" before being put away forever. Officially Mason doesnt exist but he is nonetheless compelled to lead a team of Navy SEALs underwater to Alcatraz. His job is to guide them up through the bowels of the old fort and FBI biochemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage) will disarm the rockets. Hummel has other ideas however and his men ambush all the commandos except for Mason and Goodspeed who must then try to finish the job by themselves before the Air Force is obliged to attack and kill all the hostages along with Hummel and his outfit. If you cant tell its a Simpson-Bruckheimer picture within the first reel or two the tip-off comes soon enough when Mason looking like John the Baptist and about as old demands a suite at the Fairmont Hotel and a complete makeover (from an incredibly caricatured gay hairdresser) before cooperating with the authorities. Once he looks sufficiently dashing he dangles the FBI chief his old nemesis  over the edge of the hotel and leads Goodspeed on a gratuitously and disagreeably destructive car chase. He follows that with a brief chat with the daughter he never met then dons his wetsuit in what is for Connery a little homage to the aquatic interlude of ""Thunderball."" Bay who debuted with the same producers ""Bad Boys"" last year seems right at home with the macho posturing tough talk and military logistics as he delivers a hard-hitting fast-moving thriller that if anything works overtime to make sure the audience will hang on every incident and maneuver. Script seems tailor-made to extract the particular charms of each of the three leading men. With occasional sly references to his British intelligence background and other Bondian traits Connery trades winningly on his sophisticated elegant sense of cool and callowness of many of the youngsters around him is nicely shown up by his older-but-wiser finesse. Cage in his first appearance since his Oscar win proves equally engaging as a sort of goofy chemical-set geek who must rise to the occasion of proving hes a man among the he-men elite. He makes Goodspeeds early bumbling attempts to act tough genuinely amusing and provides a necessary human connection in a world otherwise populated by ultra-pumped military types. As the righteous soldier who may or may not have tipped over the edge Harris is similarly outstanding conveying the discipline but also the thought and weight behind his extreme decisions. Supporting perfs are considerably more one-dimensional.

"The Rock (R) Critics Corner Hal Hinson - Style section ""The movie deteriorates into a long commercial for the home-game version of itself."" Desson Howe - Weekend section ""A violence-intoxicated far-fetched morally corrupt drama."" Go to Video Finder The Rock Sinks Quickly Most films featuring this (supposedly) impregnable fortress have been about busting out. This one flips the premise on its head-its about busting in. The action commences when Brig. Gen. Francis Xavier Hummel (Ed Harris) a much-respected veteran of innumerable conflicts and winner of the Congressional Medal of Honor declares war on the U.S. government. -- Hal Hinson Director Michael Bay Cast Sean Connery; Nicolas Cage; Ed Harris; Michael Biehn; William Forsythe; John C. McGinley; Claire Forlani; Vanessa Marcil Running Time 2 hours 20 minutes Filmographies Sean Connery; Nicolas Cage; Ed Harris; Claire Forlani Top of This Movie Page The Rock Bottom By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer June 07 1996 Close to the end of ""The Rock"" Sean Connery says to Nicolas Cage ""I suppose all this will make a great bedtime story to tell your kid."" Hes dead wrong. This action picture in which Connery and Cage try to prevent a squad of psycho Marines from bombing San Francisco with nerve gas is the nastiest thing anyone could inflict on a child. Even for adults the movies a violence-intoxicated far-fetched morally corrupt drama that sinks like a . . . you know. ""The Rock"" has its minor good points chiefly the bantering odd-buddy relationship between the two principals. Connery is John Patrick Mason a British agent for Her Majestys Secret Service who has been secretly jailed for 30 years without trial for stealing all of J. Edgar Hoovers secret files including Who Really Shot JFK. Cage plays the goofy Stanley Goodspeed a biological warfare expert for the FBI. Theyre thrown together because commandos led by Brigadier General Francis Xavier Hummel (Ed Harris) have stormed Alcatraz carrying 15 V.X. poison gas missiles. After locking 81 tourists into the fortresss infamous cells the elite force makes its demands known. They want mega-remuneration for the families of soldiers who have died unrewarded during covert operations from Vietnam through Operation Desert Storm. The usual cast of harried power players (Pentagon and FBI officials a young obnoxious White House chief of staff etc.) have to pony up millions of dollars or watch helplessly as five million San Franciscans implode from inhaling toxic gas. The government immediately dispatches a force of U.S. Navy SEALs to storm the citadel from the sea. Goodspeed who can neutralize the missiles and Mason the only prisoner to successfully escape from Alcatraz are sent to lead the mission. The cliches pile up like rubble while a cast of familiar action figures-including William Forsythe Michael Biehn and John C. McGinley-slips and slides all over them. (Dont these people get bored playing buffed up goons or snarling special agents?) Hack-director Michael Bay whose single stellar credit is ""Bad Boys"" deserves special mention for his production teams nauseating close-up shots annoyingly frenetic editing and bevy of tedious familiarities from those clattering digital titles (as in ""15 HOURS TO DEADLINE"") to a San Francisco car chase that leaves an incendiary heap of destroyed automobiles upset fruit carts and one overturned streetcar. It should come as no surprise that this ""Diehard"" on the rocks was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson who seem to have made every convoluted noisy movie since ""Beverly Hills Cop."" This film continues their tradition of hyperbole climax overdose and creative sleaze including a gratuitous firefight between opposing troops thats full of slow motion shots mournful battle music and mind-numbing loss of life. Theres a laughable attempt to personalize the two heroes. Just before he gets word of the Alcatraz undertaking Goodspeed is informed by his girlfriend Carla (Vanessa Marcil) that shes pregnant. He agrees to marry her. Not yet knowing what the missions all about she follows him to San Francisco. Now Goodspeed has really got something to fight for. After escaping from his FBI handlers (hes initially unwilling to participate in the Alcatraz thing) and smashing his way through the city (in that fiery car chase) Mason screeches to a halt outside the door of his estranged daughter Jade (Claire Forlani) tracks her down then tries to explain his 30-year absence. ""Im not an evil man"" he tells the daughter he hasnt seen since she was 9. ""If you can believe that then its a start."" If you could believe anything in this movie it would be a start. As for this artificial father-daughter scene its not enough that the filmmakers pummel your brain with violent cliches; theyve got to make you cringe too. THE ROCK (R) - Contains sexual situations profanity major violence and graphic reactions to nerve gas. Top of This Movie Page Top of This Movie Page Rock Alcatrazmatazz By Hal Hinson Washington Post Staff Writer June 07 1996 At the end of ""The Rock"" the adventure thriller starring Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage were informed that the film is dedicated to the loving memory of Don Simpson the infamous producer who died during production. In reality though the homage begins as soon as the lights go down. In style substance and star power ""The Rock"" offers precisely the same infinitely marketable high-octane mix of buff sex Top 40 rock and hard-core action that Simpson and his partner Jerry Bruckheimer calibrated to near-perfection in such 80s milestones as ""Flashdance"" and ""Top Gun."" The movies setting is Alcatraz the legendary island prison floating unceremoniously off San Francisco. And if most films featuring this (supposedly) impregnable fortress have been about busting out this one flips the premise on its head-its about busting in. The action commences when Brig. Gen. Francis Xavier Hummel (Ed Harris) a much-respected veteran of innumerable conflicts and winner of the Congressional Medal of Honor declares war on the U.S. government. For years Hummel and his men have done the militarys dirty work running sensitive and usually illegal operations on foreign soil. And for years the general has been outraged over having to lie to the families of the soldiers who went down during those missions. After exhausting every legal means Hummel snaps and goes over to the ""dark side."" He and his crack force of Vietnam and Persian Gulf war vets hijack a cache of rockets armed with deadly nerve gas set up command on ""the Rock"" and point their warheads right where Tony left his heart. In order to save the city (and the 81 tourists the general holds hostage inside the prison) the FBI must find a way to reach the terrorists through the maze of tunnels beneath the heavily defended facility. And so to get into Alcatraz the authorities stake their bets on the only man to ever make it out of there alive. His name is John Mason (Connery) an agent with British intelligence whom the feds have had locked away for 30 years on an unrelated matter. After Mason leads his team to the rockets the plan is for FBI chemical-biological weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed (Cage) to dismantle them. Simpson and Bruckheimer worked closely with the armed services during the making of ""The Rock"" as they had previously on both ""Top Gun"" and ""Crimson Tide."" As a result the teams allegiance to overwhelming force has never been more overwhelming. Directed like a music-video Gotterdammerung by Michael Bay (""Bad Boys"") ""The Rock"" doesnt mess around with seduction it simply takes you by storm. Initially the audacious muscularity of the images and the pace of the action are dizzying; after a while though Bay and screenwriters David Weisberg Douglas S. Cook and Mark Rosner forget about everything except the semi-suspenseful ticking of the clock. If at odd moments ""The Rock"" is better than tolerable it is usually because of its stars. On paper the thought of Connery and Cage as macho sidekicks carried a certain palpable potential for disaster; it could go either way. On screen however they look as if they were born to it with the Scots terse professionalism providing the perfect counterweight to Cages crazed spritzing. Connery-who makes his entrance looking more like Methuselah than James Bond-remains one of the few truly indelible star actors alive. Like Bogart like Tracy Connery is always fully present as himself regardless of the role. And yet the articulation of each character is clearly defined singular with subtle differences in the way each conveys thought in their gestures and emotions. A self-described chemical super-freak Goodspeed is pretty close to normal by Cages standards. Still the actor squeezes off one burst of bizarro genius after another. His presense is naturally subversive and if it werent for the leavening effect of his mad spiels the films testosterone levels might become lethally high. Director Bay gives the picture a sense of humor plus a certain adroitness and flash-that is at least for as long as it continues to function as a film per se. Ultimately the movie deteriorates into a long commercial for the home-game version of itself. And with regard to Simpson and the Simpson/Bruckheimer legacy this total surrender to merchandising is particularly sad. Whatever you might say about their movies they were always filmmakers first. The Rock is rated PG-13. Top of This Movie Page",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/rock.htm#howe,200,therock9,therock,washingtonpost

More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Co-opting Oscar as a shill shows the cunning touch of producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer. From Top Gun with Tom Cruise to Crimson Tide with Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman Simpson and Bruckheimer have always known how to use class to sell crass. Its ironic that The Rock which marks the first teaming of Cage 32 and Connery 65 is also the final collaboration between shoot-the-works Simpson and by-the-book Bruckheimer. The 52-year-old Simpson died in January -- in the john like Elvis -- after a lifetime of substance abuse. In such films as Flashdance Beverly Hills Cop I and II and Days of Thunder the producers became infamous for excess. The frugal 90s put them out of business until last years Bad Boys (made for a paltry for them 20 million) grossed 140 million worldwide and began a new string of hits including Crimson Tide and Dangerous Minds. Simpson and Bruckheimer pumped up audiences and pissed off critics by dressing up crude formulas with star power and making a box-office killing. The Rock a rousing epitaph to Simpsons party spirit looks ready to do the same. Is it the fat paycheck that makes such actors as Cage and Connery go along? Cages 4 million fee for The Rock exceeds by 500000 the entire budget of Leaving Las Vegas the film that just won him the Oscar. Cage hasnt mined box-office gold since he romanced Cher in Moonstruck in 1987 the same year that Connery won his Oscar for The Untouchables. Except for Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and The Hunt for Red October Connery has spent the years since his Academy acceptance speech trying to shake off such flops as Medicine Man Rising Sun Just Cause and First Knight. Both actors are slumming in the blatantly commercial confines of The Rock to enhance their reps as bankable commodities. Its the money stupid. Or is it? That answer doesnt allow for the dazzling teamwork from Cage and Connery who could easily walk through their roles if they were just cynically cashing in. Instead theyre having a ball and the spirit is contagious. Cage plays Stanley Goodspeed the bumbling FBI biochemist called in when a rogue general (Ed Harris) launches a military raid on Alcatraz holding 81 tourists hostage to protest the governments refusal to pay benefits to the families of war veterans who died during covert military operations. The general threatens to launch rockets loaded with VX poison gas on the Bay Area unless reparations are made. Only Stanley a ""chemical superfreak"" can dismantle the rockets filled with lethal green pellets that can melt a body in seconds. What Stanley needs is someone who knows the secret passageways of Alcatraz to get him inside. Enter Connery as John Patrick Mason a former British intelligence agent (shades of James Bond) who has been imprisoned for 30 years without a trial for stealing -- attention Oliver Stone -- the private files of J. Edgar Hoover. John escaped from Alcatraz in 1962 -- for just long enough to father a daughter before his recapture. Like the generals beloved covert operatives he doesnt officially exist. Connerys first appearance in a long wig and beard is a howl. Despite his hatred of the FBI John agrees to get Stanley on Alcatraz in return for a full pardon and a night at the posh Fairmont Hotel where he demands a shower a shave and ""the feel of a new suit."" You havent lived until you hear Connerys in-shower rendition of ""If youre goin to San Francisco/Be sure to wear some flowers in your hair"" and see him transformed into an impeccably tailored white-bearded loose cannon. Big bad John dangles an FBI agent off the hotel balcony and tries an escape that allows the tirelessly exuberant director Michael Bay (Bad Boys) to stage a high-speed chase that dents more Frisco hills and cable cars than Bullitt did. The humor and the heart come in watching Connery and Cage go at each other and form a relationship while ducking bullets and bombs on Alcatraz. ""I drive a Volvo -- a beige one"" says Stanley using his nerd status as an excuse for being a klutz commando. Stanley wants John to cut him some slack for doing his best. ""Losers always whine about their best"" says the impatient John who wants to let it rip -- full out no excuses. If you see a parallel in the way John (rhymes with Don) makes mayhem and Don Simpson made movies its surely no accident. The Rocks two protagonists -- one a dangerously skittering comet the other a grounded realist trying to hold course -- are Simpson and Bruckheimer in a nutshell. Bruckheimer once threatened to dissolve their alliance as a way to snap Simpson out of his self-destructive habits. Bruckheimer will continue to produce films -- although without his black-sheep partner their tenor will be different. Simpson died without tapping any depths as a filmmaker. He is indefensible as an artist but indisputable as a showman. Simpson lives on in Tom Cruises Top Gun flash in Eddie Murphys Beverly Hills Cop swagger and in Sean Connerys daredevil insolence in The Rock a fitting wild-ride finale for the team of Simpson and Bruckheimer.

"Between a Rock and Loud Place - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-AlcatrazMOVIE REVIEW Between a Rock and Loud PlaceThe film is a nonstop aural bombardment beating viewers into submission if they cant be convinced by saner methods.June 07 1996|KENNETH TURAN | TIMES FILM CRITIC The closing credits for ""The Rock"" include a dedication ""in loving memory to Don Simpson"" but this last film from the late producer and his partner Jerry Bruckheimer so perfectly encapsulates everything the pair have stood for that the actual words are superfluous.A picture that believes that bigger and louder are better that success goes to whatever makes the most noise and does the most damage this story of a nasty hostage situation on Alcatraz epitomizes trends in Hollywood filmmaking that have made many people very rich while impoverishing audiences around the world.Slick and forceful largely unconcerned with character eager for any opportunity to pump up the volume both literally and metaphorically ""The Rock"" is the kind of efficient entertainment that is hard to take pleasure in. Its this years model of a dangerous sports car or a designer knife You dont know whether to admire it or run for cover when it approaches.Director Michael Bay who performed similar services on Simpson-Bruckheimers ""Bad Boys"" has no trouble making action move crisply and efficiently. Whether the script (credited to David Weisberg amp; Douglas S. Cook and Mark Rosner) has people being crushed knifed impaled or merely shot pausing for breath is not a viable option.This soldierly rigor is fitting in a story that involves two opposing military operations one to take over Alcatraz and threaten San Francisco with a lethal gas attack the other an attempt to take the venerable island prison back again.Heading the first maneuver is Marine Brig. Gen. Francis Xavier Hummel (Ed Harris impressive as always). Variously described as a legend and the greatest battalion commander of the Vietnam War Hummel has more decorations than a pawn shop window. He also has a serious attitude problem vis-a-vis the state hes loyally served.Irked by the lack of respect and cash paid to the families of men who died in government-sponsored covert operations Hummel masterminds an operation to steal quantities of V.X. poison gas ""one of the most deadly substances the Earth has ever known."" Then he grabs Alcatraz takes 81 civilian hostages points the gas toward the City by the Bay and gives Washington 40 hours to come up with millions in domestic reparations.Understandably reluctant to pay cash the government instead infiltrates the Rock with a Navy SEAL team supplemented by a pair of unusual and highly skilled additions ""a 60-year-old convict and a lab rat"" played respectively by Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage.Connery is John Patrick Mason a former whiz for the British secret service and in the films typically emphatic terminology ""one of the most dangerous men alive."" Imprisoned without trial for 30 years Mason once escaped from Alcatraz (shh its a secret) and his knowledge of the prisons subterranean superstructure is just what any assault team would need. If he can be trusted.Cage plays the mans opposite number eccentric FBI agent Stanley Goodspeed. He may seem like a bumbling fool who drives a beige Volvo and is willing to spend 600 on a vintage Beatles record but in reality Goodspeed is a nerveless ace when it comes to disabling chemical weapons. If he can get close enough to go to work.Though ""The Rock"" does not lack for elaborate and effective action set-pieces the excitement generated by this scenario feels artificial and the film pushes itself so hard the desire to push back is inevitable.With characters in a constant state of panic refusing to speak when yelling is an option ""The Rock"" is quite an assault itself a nonstop bombardment that is content to pound audiences into submission if they cant be convinced by saner methods.Despite its success in keeping Brig. Gen. Hummel from becoming a standard-issue villain ""The Rock"" does not have its heart in its human moments and that does hurt. Happy to make jokes at the expense of weary cliches like effete hairdressers and doltish foreigners the film leaves its actors to their own devices while accentuating the mayhem. Jane Austen country this is not. MPAA rating R for strong violence language and a sex scene. Times guidelines shootings knifings a man crushed to death and another impaled.(BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC)The RockSean Connery John Patrick MasonNicolas Cage Stanley GoodspeedEd Harris Brig.

"Rock The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; rock-the ) Rock The (United States 1996) A movie review by James Berardinelli It seems that once every dozen-or-so years Sean Connery has the urge to go back into Bondage. After turning in his tuxedo and Aston Martin following 1971s Diamonds Are Forever Connery ventured into the acting market as a free agent. His vow to ""never again"" play 007 held for a little over a decade. Lured back by an enormous sum of money and the offer of limited creative control Connery returned to Her Majestys Secret Service in 1983 with the ""unofficial"" Bond entry Never Say Never Again. Now in 1996s The Rock the veteran actor has once more come home to the action genre. Granted his character is called John Mason not James Bond but Connery plays him exactly as he might portray a sixty- something version of the world-renowned British spy. The Rock is the summer of 1996s first ""traditional"" action film. There are no tornadoes to chase or dragons to slay and while the plot certainly isnt Dostoevsky it beats Mission Impossibles swiss-cheese-like storyline hands down. Theres some wry humor amidst all the wreckage from car chases and missile strikes and a few of the characters are allowed to break through their stereotypical boundaries. Not surprisingly the energy level is high and theres plenty of action ranking this film alongside Broken Arrow and Executive Decision among the years best high-adrenaline offerings. As is often the case with action films a simple premise is the most effective. Here its that a group of ex-Marines have stolen 15 VX gas rockets and are threatening to launch a lethal strike on the San Francisco Bay area if their demands arent met. Led by war hero and living legend Brigadier General Frank Hummel (Ed Harris) the crack platoon has holed up on Alcatraz where theyre holding 81 civilians hostage. The U.S. government responds by sending a troop of Navy SEALS on a secret raid using the labyrinth of tunnels beneath the island as their entranceway. Their guide is the only man ever to escape from the legendary prison ex-SAS operative John Mason (Connery). Also in the party is FBI agent Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage) an admitted ""chemical superfreak"" who has the knowledge and experience to defuse Hummels rockets. The cast is first rate. Nicolas Cage last years Best Actor Oscar winner doesnt excel as an action hero but hes a good enough performer to forge a likable character. Ed Harris portrays a surprisingly sympathetic bad guy. Unlike most villains in this sort of movie his Hummel isnt greedy or mad -- just angry. Hes championing a cause (""this isnt about terrorism -- its about justice"") and feels that drastic action is the only way to get people to listen to him. David Morse who left an impression in last years The Crossing Guard is Hummels right-hand man. John Spencer portrays the FBI director Michael Biehn is the SEAL team leader and Vanessa Marcil is Goodspeeds pregnant fiancee who has been placed in harms way. But the real standout is of course Connery. Having lost none of his charisma with age the veteran actor puts to use his mastery of mixing humor and action. Just like Bond Mason does all his shooting and battling with tongue in cheek. Along the way he develops a nice rapport with Goodspeed with the two actors clicking in the best ""buddy movie"" fashion. The Rocks running time could have been trimmed. Theres no reason for it to last a bloated one-hundred thirty-five minutes (unless its trying to rival the Bond films for length). Much of the early character-building material could have been shortened without damaging the complexity of the principal trio and certain aspects of the script might have benefiting from a little tightening up. Flaws aside however The Rock still represents a loud fast-paced nights worth of entertainment. There are all the expected shoot-outs explosions and death-defying stunts. Director Michael Bay (Bad Boys) doesnt break new ground but he displays his command of the genre by keeping the familiar from becoming boring. His steals from Quentin Tarantino (a master of theft in his own right) and others fit seamlessly into this movie. Producers Jerry Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson have a highly-successful resume that includes Top Gun and Crimson Tide. The Rock will add more luster to that reputation. Since Twister and Mission Impossible are losing a fraction of their tremendous momentum The Rock is poised to storm past them. With Connery Cage Harris and a host of harrowing action sequences this is the kind of breath-stealing summer entertainment that audiences crave. Although not as expertly-crafted as Die Hard or Speed The Rock is exhausting in its own right -- and thats just one of several convincing reasons to see this film.

"The Rock (R) Critics Corner Hal Hinson - Style section ""The movie deteriorates into a long commercial for the home-game version of itself."" Desson Howe - Weekend section ""A violence-intoxicated far-fetched morally corrupt drama."" Go to Video Finder The Rock Sinks Quickly Most films featuring this (supposedly) impregnable fortress have been about busting out. This one flips the premise on its head-its about busting in. The action commences when Brig. Gen. Francis Xavier Hummel (Ed Harris) a much-respected veteran of innumerable conflicts and winner of the Congressional Medal of Honor declares war on the U.S. government. -- Hal Hinson Director Michael Bay Cast Sean Connery; Nicolas Cage; Ed Harris; Michael Biehn; William Forsythe; John C. McGinley; Claire Forlani; Vanessa Marcil Running Time 2 hours 20 minutes Filmographies Sean Connery; Nicolas Cage; Ed Harris; Claire Forlani Top of This Movie Page The Rock Bottom By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer June 07 1996 Close to the end of ""The Rock"" Sean Connery says to Nicolas Cage ""I suppose all this will make a great bedtime story to tell your kid."" Hes dead wrong. This action picture in which Connery and Cage try to prevent a squad of psycho Marines from bombing San Francisco with nerve gas is the nastiest thing anyone could inflict on a child. Even for adults the movies a violence-intoxicated far-fetched morally corrupt drama that sinks like a . . . you know. ""The Rock"" has its minor good points chiefly the bantering odd-buddy relationship between the two principals. Connery is John Patrick Mason a British agent for Her Majestys Secret Service who has been secretly jailed for 30 years without trial for stealing all of J. Edgar Hoovers secret files including Who Really Shot JFK. Cage plays the goofy Stanley Goodspeed a biological warfare expert for the FBI. Theyre thrown together because commandos led by Brigadier General Francis Xavier Hummel (Ed Harris) have stormed Alcatraz carrying 15 V.X. poison gas missiles. After locking 81 tourists into the fortresss infamous cells the elite force makes its demands known. They want mega-remuneration for the families of soldiers who have died unrewarded during covert operations from Vietnam through Operation Desert Storm. The usual cast of harried power players (Pentagon and FBI officials a young obnoxious White House chief of staff etc.) have to pony up millions of dollars or watch helplessly as five million San Franciscans implode from inhaling toxic gas. The government immediately dispatches a force of U.S. Navy SEALs to storm the citadel from the sea. Goodspeed who can neutralize the missiles and Mason the only prisoner to successfully escape from Alcatraz are sent to lead the mission. The cliches pile up like rubble while a cast of familiar action figures-including William Forsythe Michael Biehn and John C. McGinley-slips and slides all over them. (Dont these people get bored playing buffed up goons or snarling special agents?) Hack-director Michael Bay whose single stellar credit is ""Bad Boys"" deserves special mention for his production teams nauseating close-up shots annoyingly frenetic editing and bevy of tedious familiarities from those clattering digital titles (as in ""15 HOURS TO DEADLINE"") to a San Francisco car chase that leaves an incendiary heap of destroyed automobiles upset fruit carts and one overturned streetcar. It should come as no surprise that this ""Diehard"" on the rocks was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson who seem to have made every convoluted noisy movie since ""Beverly Hills Cop."" This film continues their tradition of hyperbole climax overdose and creative sleaze including a gratuitous firefight between opposing troops thats full of slow motion shots mournful battle music and mind-numbing loss of life. Theres a laughable attempt to personalize the two heroes. Just before he gets word of the Alcatraz undertaking Goodspeed is informed by his girlfriend Carla (Vanessa Marcil) that shes pregnant. He agrees to marry her. Not yet knowing what the missions all about she follows him to San Francisco. Now Goodspeed has really got something to fight for. After escaping from his FBI handlers (hes initially unwilling to participate in the Alcatraz thing) and smashing his way through the city (in that fiery car chase) Mason screeches to a halt outside the door of his estranged daughter Jade (Claire Forlani) tracks her down then tries to explain his 30-year absence. ""Im not an evil man"" he tells the daughter he hasnt seen since she was 9. ""If you can believe that then its a start."" If you could believe anything in this movie it would be a start. As for this artificial father-daughter scene its not enough that the filmmakers pummel your brain with violent cliches; theyve got to make you cringe too. THE ROCK (R) - Contains sexual situations profanity major violence and graphic reactions to nerve gas. Top of This Movie Page Top of This Movie Page Rock Alcatrazmatazz By Hal Hinson Washington Post Staff Writer June 07 1996 At the end of ""The Rock"" the adventure thriller starring Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage were informed that the film is dedicated to the loving memory of Don Simpson the infamous producer who died during production. In reality though the homage begins as soon as the lights go down. In style substance and star power ""The Rock"" offers precisely the same infinitely marketable high-octane mix of buff sex Top 40 rock and hard-core action that Simpson and his partner Jerry Bruckheimer calibrated to near-perfection in such 80s milestones as ""Flashdance"" and ""Top Gun."" The movies setting is Alcatraz the legendary island prison floating unceremoniously off San Francisco. And if most films featuring this (supposedly) impregnable fortress have been about busting out this one flips the premise on its head-its about busting in. The action commences when Brig. Gen. Francis Xavier Hummel (Ed Harris) a much-respected veteran of innumerable conflicts and winner of the Congressional Medal of Honor declares war on the U.S. government. For years Hummel and his men have done the militarys dirty work running sensitive and usually illegal operations on foreign soil. And for years the general has been outraged over having to lie to the families of the soldiers who went down during those missions. After exhausting every legal means Hummel snaps and goes over to the ""dark side."" He and his crack force of Vietnam and Persian Gulf war vets hijack a cache of rockets armed with deadly nerve gas set up command on ""the Rock"" and point their warheads right where Tony left his heart. In order to save the city (and the 81 tourists the general holds hostage inside the prison) the FBI must find a way to reach the terrorists through the maze of tunnels beneath the heavily defended facility. And so to get into Alcatraz the authorities stake their bets on the only man to ever make it out of there alive. His name is John Mason (Connery) an agent with British intelligence whom the feds have had locked away for 30 years on an unrelated matter. After Mason leads his team to the rockets the plan is for FBI chemical-biological weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed (Cage) to dismantle them. Simpson and Bruckheimer worked closely with the armed services during the making of ""The Rock"" as they had previously on both ""Top Gun"" and ""Crimson Tide."" As a result the teams allegiance to overwhelming force has never been more overwhelming. Directed like a music-video Gotterdammerung by Michael Bay (""Bad Boys"") ""The Rock"" doesnt mess around with seduction it simply takes you by storm. Initially the audacious muscularity of the images and the pace of the action are dizzying; after a while though Bay and screenwriters David Weisberg Douglas S. Cook and Mark Rosner forget about everything except the semi-suspenseful ticking of the clock. If at odd moments ""The Rock"" is better than tolerable it is usually because of its stars. On paper the thought of Connery and Cage as macho sidekicks carried a certain palpable potential for disaster; it could go either way. On screen however they look as if they were born to it with the Scots terse professionalism providing the perfect counterweight to Cages crazed spritzing. Connery-who makes his entrance looking more like Methuselah than James Bond-remains one of the few truly indelible star actors alive. Like Bogart like Tracy Connery is always fully present as himself regardless of the role. And yet the articulation of each character is clearly defined singular with subtle differences in the way each conveys thought in their gestures and emotions. A self-described chemical super-freak Goodspeed is pretty close to normal by Cages standards. Still the actor squeezes off one burst of bizarro genius after another. His presense is naturally subversive and if it werent for the leavening effect of his mad spiels the films testosterone levels might become lethally high. Director Bay gives the picture a sense of humor plus a certain adroitness and flash-that is at least for as long as it continues to function as a film per se. Ultimately the movie deteriorates into a long commercial for the home-game version of itself. And with regard to Simpson and the Simpson/Bruckheimer legacy this total surrender to merchandising is particularly sad. Whatever you might say about their movies they were always filmmakers first. The Rock is rated PG-13. Top of This Movie Page",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/rock.htm#hinson,200,therock13,therock,washingtonpost

Starring Sean Connery Nicolas Cage and Ed Harris. Directed by Michael Bay. (R. 136 minutes.) The Rock"" is a raucous in- your-face commando-style action thriller now out on video that makes provocative use of Alcatraz as a lunatics lair and San Francisco as a sitting duck. Sean Connery Nicolas Cage and Ed Harris star in this heavy- metal cinematic event -- but Cage steals the show adding a touch of wimpiness to the high-decibel bravado. There are plenty of gaps in the story of superpatriot military types led by Marine Brigadier General Francis X. Hummel (Harris) who take over Alcatraz and threaten to launch poison-gas missiles into San Francisco unless their demands are met. Director Michael Bay (""Bad Boys"") keeps a heart-pounding rhythm throughout. The close-up gritty camera work and quick cuts maintain the high energy. Among the action sequences is a dizzying car chase that concludes with an explosion that upends a Hyde Street cable car. Alcatraz is impressively cast as a star of the film. ""The Rock"" captures the sites bleak isolation while also suggesting a labyrinthine system of abandoned underground tunnels and facilities (created on a Hollywood soundstage) that attest to the islands eerie history. Cage plays Stanley Goodspeed an FBI chemical and biological weapons expert -- and the only guy in the movie who seems to be anywhere near normal. He is called away from Washington and his pregnant girlfriend (Vanessa Marcil) to help the feds deal with the takeover of Alcatraz. Nervous because he has no real training as a cop or a soldier Goodspeed is essentially a hang-loose joshing lab- rat type who cant relate to the military mind-set by which hes suddenly surrounded. Connery plays John Patrick Mason a bitter federal prisoner locked up for 30 years without trial for having stolen U.S. national security secrets when he was a British secret agent. Once housed on Alcatraz he is the only inmate ever to have escaped and now feds who loathe him want to exploit his knowledge of the Rock to stop Hummels threatened attack. Connery shows his amazing gift for making a gnarly tough guy and curmudgeon utterly charming.

For 2 hours and 9 minutes the movie slams forward in a jackhammer frenzy. The camera never stops moving and the images are chopped up in stroboscopic music-video style so that every machine-gun blast every smashed building and flying body is jammed up against another even more ""explosive"" image of depersonalized mayhem. The final film produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson the team that gave us Flashdance Top Gun Beverly Hills Cop and Bad Boys (as well as the anomalously first-rate Crimson Tide) The Rock has already been hailed as ""the drop-dead thrill ride of the year"" In its fill-in-the-hype way that line is more accurate than it knows This is a movie out to entertain you even if it kills you in the process. A renegade Marine (Ed Harris) decorated in three wars leads his outlaw brigade into the ""rock"" of Alcatraz the famous now defunct and shuttered island prison in the middle of San Francisco Bay. Taking a group of tourists hostage he threatens to bombard the city with poison-gas rockets unless the families of all the men whove died under his command in covert missions are paid a million dollars apiece. The FBI assembles a rescue squad headed up by two men Sean Connery the only prisoner to have ever escaped from Alcatraz and Nicolas Cage a chemical/biological weapons expert who works behind the scenes at the FBI but has never had the occasion to use his gun. The team enters the prison fortress underwater and spends the rest of the film trying to defuse the bombs -- and elude Harris men -- within Alcatrazs labyrinthine catacombs which the movie uses as a dank decaying maze like the spaceships in the Alien films. Back in 1988 few would have guessed that the plot of Die Hard would become the prototype for nearly every big-budget action movie. But then even fewer might have predicted that Die Hard itself a movie that originally seemed a sly joke of excess would now look like a model of classical restraint. The Rock is a ride so relentless and assaultive it runs roughshod over its own characters. Early on theres a hair-trigger sequence in which Cage locked in a glass chamber has to defuse a bomb; the director Michael Bay (Bad Boys) works in such a jittery overwrought way that the movie seems more nervous about the situation than we are. A little later were treated to a mammoth car chase which of course is meaner louder smashier than any such sequence before it -- a duel to make the demolition derby in The French Connection look like a turn-of-the-century buggy ride. Cars are crushed like paper cups pedestrians go flying and I lost count of apocalyptic payoffs -- a car plonking through a block of parking meters a fireball hoisting a trolley car 20 feet into the air. The film also smashes any pretense of plausibility. Cage for instance is supposed to be playing a civilized brainiac the mild modern guy who must learn to put aside thought for action. So why half an hour into the movie is he already acting like Bruce Willis leaping into a yellow Ferrari to barrel through San Francisco like a suicidal road warrior? Because in the jacked-up world of The Rock nothing matters but the violent incendiary moment. Even in a movie thats all noise and bluster Cage and Connery inject tasty bits of personality into their roles. Connery as the aging renegade shows up looking like the Unabomber and surprises us by expressing his wit less through dialogue -- by now were almost too used to that surly burr -- than through his quicker-than-the-eye reflexes. He makes suave comedy out of his utter lack of fear hesitation scruples. As his worrywart scientist partner Cage happily doesnt have to abandon the charismatic zigzags in mood -- the leaps from goofiness to rage -- that have marked his performances in movies like Leaving Las Vegas. He plays right to the gallery with his gleam of soulful skepticism and his funky off-kilter line readings as when he says to Connery ""How in the name of Zeus butthole did you get out of your cell?"" With a greater chance for interplay these two might have made a memorable team. As it is they spend most of the film going through the robotically impersonal motions of action mega-heroics dodging bullets thwacking enemies defusing poison bombs in enough down-to-the-wire climaxes to stock a dozen conventional thrillers. If Simpson and Bruckheimer had an aesthetic it was to turn movies into pure catharsis narcotic rushes of audiovisual energy. Perhaps its appropriate that in the last project to bear their names they attained a kind of summer-movie apotheosis the action spectacle as drug with ""fun"" now raised to the level of exhaustion. The Rock numbs your sensory receptors and then assaults you through the numbness. It invites you to feel thrilled at feeling nothing at all.
