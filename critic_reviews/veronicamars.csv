Comments click to enlarge Veronica Mars Video Rated PG-13  107 minutes  2014 On the verge of accepting a job at a high-powered New York law firm former teenage sleuth Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) is lured back to her hometown by an old flame to solve a murder conveniently arriving on the same weekend as their ten-year high school reunion. Director Rob Thomas caters directly to fans of the 2004-07 cable series (as well he should have; they funded the film through Kickstarter); this big-screen version packs in as many old characters as possible and a few of the series most famous lines are repeated word for word. The uninitiated may not go for the all-too-convenient crime solving melodramatic love triangle and playful banter but cultists will find all the shows pleasures intact.

"Veronica Mars - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Veronica Mars Posted by Christy Lemire on March 17 2014 Leave a Comment Warner Bros. Pictures Rated PG-13 for sexuality including references drug content violence and some strong language. Running time 108 minutes. Three stars out of four. Full confession time Ive never seen a single episode of ""Veronica Mars."" It just escaped my pop-culture purview a decade ago for whatever reason. I knew it had achieved a bit of a cult following but I didnt understand why. And I knew Kristen Bell had a likable screen presence but Id never seen her playing the girl-detective the role that made her a star. Now that Ive seen ""Veronica Mars"" the movie it all makes sense to me. The snappy banter the self-aware characters the twisty mystery -- they all come together to make a lively witty stew. The film is at once charmingly retro and coolly contemporary borrowing equal parts from gumshoe film noir and self-referential television like ""Moonlighting"" and ""Dawsons Creek."" In bringing his petite and plucky heroine to the big screen series creator Rob Thomas -- here serving as both director and co-writer -- wisely makes her accessible to fans and neophytes alike. ""Veronica Mars"" famously used Kickstarter to raise an unprecedented 5.7 million -- the reason youre seeing it in actual theaters as well as through the convenience of video on demand. People who love the show and the character clearly have a stake in how shes depicted here a decade after Thomas introduced her. Key supporting players are back including Veronicas dad private eye Keith Mars (Enrico Colatoni); former boyfriend Logan (Jason Dohring); and close pals Wallace (Percy Daggs III) Weevil (Francis Capra) and Mac (Tina Majorino). But Thomas and co-writer Diane Ruggiero bring the rest of us up to speed on who Veronica is and what shes been up to the past few years through a brisk prologue with pithy voiceover. Having left the wealthy (and apparently crime-addled) beach hamlet of Neptune Calif. Veronica is now enjoying being big-city girl in New York. Shes just graduated from law school and is on the verge of taking a high-paying job at a prestigious law firm (Jamie Lee Curtis has a couple of quick but effective scenes as the executive whos wooing her). But when a classmate-turned-pop-star is found dead in a bathtub and Logan -- the singers current boyfriend - is named the primed suspect Veronica knows she has no choice but to come home and solve the mystery. And what do you know? She just happens to have returned in time for her 10-year high school reunion an event she never would have dreamed of attending otherwise. As she finds herself getting wrapped up in her old world once more Veronica must leave behind her current boyfriend Piz (Chris Lowell) who works for NPR and seems like a decent enough dude. Logan meanwhile has transformed himself into a hunky Navy JAG (and the reference to ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" is inevitable when he shows up in his crisp white uniform). The fact that ""Veronica Mars"" doesnt melodramatize the fact that she finds herself torn between two great guys -- or shame her for the brief period in which shes involved with both of them -- is shockingly revolutionary in its understatement and pragmatism. Then again Veronica herself is such a breath of fresh air as a strong female character smart secure resourceful loyal funny and not the slightest bit chickish. Bells presence is delightful -- sexy yet accessible -- and she handles the highly verbal dialogue with unshakable aplomb. Maybe there are a few too many stray supporting figures and red herrings for her (and us) to sort through as the truth behind the murder becomes clearer but you wont mind being by Veronicas side for a second of her sleuthing.

The first season of Veronica Mars is one of the items in the time capsule Im building so that future civilizations might know us as the best versions of ourselves. I treasure that show. I love that show. I even love the less-good second and third seasons. But when news came that creator Rob Thomas was Kickstarter-ing a reunion movie I was not thrilled. Its bad enough to endure a beloved shows cancellation but the years and years of ""will there be a movie?"" chitchat just rubbed it in -- and now that a movie actually was happening it was like a reward for that annoying fan behavior. Plus there was the danger that it wouldnt be good. Creator Rob Thomas had done a revival before after all His 1998 series Cupid came back in 2009 and while the second version had its charms it just wasnt the same. So it was with enormous trepidation that I watched the Veronica Mars movie. Please dont be bad please dont be bad I begged the entertainment gods who have generally not smiled on TV shows that become movies. Somehow miraculously the Veronica Mars movie is definitely not bad. Its pretty damn good actually. Related Stories Rob Thomas on Veronica Mars Party Down and Kevin Hart 7 Reasons Why Men Should Give Veronica Mars a Shot Though only if youre a Veronica Mars fan already. I cant imagine anyone who wasnt interested in the show being interested in the movie but just in case The show was about high school student Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) and the seedy California town of Neptune where she grew up. Half the town was richy-rich movie stars and tech scions and the other half was not; Veronica fell from her place atop the social totem pole when her best friend was murdered and Veronicas father (Enrico Colantoni) then the towns sheriff seemingly botched the investigation. He then became a private investigator and Veronica his faithful assistant and a talented investigator herself. When we meet her again in the movie shes graduating from law school in New York and is poised to accept a job at a tony firm. She and her college boyfriend Piz (Chris Lowell) have stayed together but then she gets a call from Logan (Jason Dohring) her volatile high school boyfriend and true love and suddenly shes back on a plane to Neptune. A long time ago we used to be friends ... Logan has as usual been accused of a murder he did not commit this time the death of his girlfriend pop star Bonnie De Ville -- the stage name of one of Logan and Veronicas classmates the former Carrie Bishop. On the TV show Carrie Bishop was played memorably by Leighton Meester; here its someone else which feels off even though we only see Carrie in flashbacks and photos. Carries just one of many Neptune residents to make a return appearance in the movie Just about every memorable character from the show pops up at some point including Dick Casablacas (Ryan Hansen) Deputy Leo (Max Greenfield) Vinnie Van Lowe (Ken Marino) and even Celeste Kane (Lisa Thornhill). Mac (Tina Majorino) and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) of course wind up dragging Veronica to her ten-year reunion where the only notable absence is Duncan (Teddy Dunn) though no one seems to miss him. I certainly didnt. Veronica Mars The Movie plays like a long episode of Veronica Mars The TV Show with all the relationships and in-jokes intact. There are movie references galore a subtle nod to Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Piz admits that Neptune really does seem to be built on ""a Hellmouth"") and all the sarcasm you can squeeze into 100 minutes. Logan gets plenty of screen time. Theres an impressively tense action sequence and of course Veronica has to use her brilliant quick wit and trusty taser to escape the clutches of a murderer. And to temper some of the rah-rah good feelings of seeing the whole gang again the movie includes a reminder as there were in many episodes of the show that its not just the evil villains who dislike Veronica; she can be pretty nasty sometimes even to people who look up to her. She can close herself off from things very effectively which is a self-preservation mechanism that sometimes has the unintended consequence of keeping the good stuff out too. Here in the movie Veronica apparently didnt know her onetime good friend Weevil (Francis Capra) was married and had a 3-year-old. Perhaps there is no Facebook in her world. The mechanics of the movies central murder mystery work just fine and all the performances are as good as they were on the show. (And Krysten Ritter who was not very compelling back in 2005 when she originated Gia has become a much much better actress in the ensuing years.) But theres nothing all that grand or special about the movie -- fun yes; amusing yes; comforting in that it feels like seeing an old friend absolutely. When Veronica Mars premiered on television it stunned me with how frankly it approached sexual assault how confident its stylized noir dialogue seemed how ambitious its well-woven season-long mysteries were. The show really did and continues to amaze me. The movie less so.

Veronica Mars By Peter Travers March 13 2014 More News Life on Mars What to Know Before Seeing the Veronica Mars Movie Watch the Veronica Mars Movies Opener All Stories >> Revolutions can sneak up on you. Take Veronica Mars a 2004 TV series on UPN (now the CW) that spawned a cult (Im a member) and then got dumped after Season Three when the ratings tanked. When we last saw teen sleuth Veronica (a stellar Kristen Bell) whose jones for crime-solving ignited when she was drugged and raped in high school she was on a precipice torn between two lovers and an uncertain future. More News Life on Mars What to Know Before Seeing the Veronica Mars Movie Watch the Veronica Mars Movies Opener All Stories >> Series creator Rob Thomas wanted to leave Veronica hanging. He envisioned Veronica Mars coming back as a low-budget movie. Warner Bros. which owned the series practically yawned in his face. Like F. Murray Abrahams talent boss in Inside Llewyn Davis the studio listened and basically said ""I dont see the money here."" Old story. But theres a new twist. Thomas and Bell were fired up by a passionate fan base. They went to Kickstarter the crowd-funding platform - called ""the peoples NEA"" by The New York Times - to help bring the project to life for five percent of the take. Warner Bros. through its digital arm agreed to a theatrical release and ancillary costs if Team Mars could raise 2 million. The team shot a comic pitch at Bells home hit the campaign trail everywhere from Twitter to Comic Con and offered 32 pledge levels that ranged from 1 to 10000. Incentives varied from T-shirts autographed scripts premiere invites and the top prize a speaking part going to Steve Dengler as a video-show host. Team Mars hit 2 million in 10 hours with 91585 backers finally raising the total to 5.7 million enough to finance a 23-day shoot with a few action scenes. The fans who proudly wore I SAVED VERONICA MARS stickers were right They did. Time out here for a bitch session. When Zach Braff sought Kickstarter financing for Wish I Was Here and Spike Lee followed with a Kickstarter joint called Da Sweet Blood of Jesus complaints rose about name filmmakers hustling money from the public when unlike you and your pal Herbie they had the clout and the cash to do it themselves. Point taken. Right now the question is how did Veronica Mars turn out as a movie? Its a mixed bag. Too much time wasted on a whodunit thats more like a who-cares. No matter. Mars fans will have a blast. And those jazzy blues notes that deepened the series resonate onscreen. The Veronica we meet nine years later has camouflaged the emotionally bruised California teen from the fictional town of Neptune. Shes a New York lawyer wearing her chic suits like armor and settled in with nice guy Piz Piznarski (Chris Lowell). Naturally that wont last. Shes called back to Neptune by Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) the bad-boy millionaire now implicated in the murder of a pop singer. Can Veronica save her ex-lover? Can a plot be any more predictable? Heres the thing Plot has never been the attraction in Veronica Mars. Veronica can throw a punch or a put-down with the best of them. But its how she thinks that draws us in not her body count. The murders in this femcentric film noir are just a way into exploring character notably Veronica and her father Keith (the invaluable Enrico Colantoni) a sheriff-turned-Neptune PI. The same telling detail goes into the movie with a script by Thomas and Diane Ruggiero that keeps its eye on the broken places in its characters. Hell Veronica has always called herself a Marshmallow a term the shows fans proudly apply to themselves. How will non-Marshmallows react to the movie? With some confusion even though a prologue offers helpful clues. As a director Thomas shows a comic touch thats still bracing especially in a high school reunion that turns into a free-for-all uniting most of the TV cast. Look for Ryan Hansen as ""sexual sharknado"" Dick Casablancas and Krysten Ritter as mean girl Gia Goodman. James Franco is a hoot playing himself as the victim of hidden cameras that show him squeezing painfully into skinny jeans and trying hilariously to come up with words that rhyme with ""orange."" But its Bell - riding high with the Disney-animated Frozen and Showtimes carnal-fixated House of Lies - you want to follow anywhere. Bell is irresistible and she makes us care. Time will tell if audiences care enough to make something historic out of the Kickstarter launch of Veronica Mars. Even though Id enjoy seeing Seinfeld on the big screen with Jerry George Kramer and Elaine released from prison the crowdfunding concept should be bigger than reviving favorite TV shows. Thanks to Bell Thomas and Kickstarter weve discovered new life on Mars. Now whod risk a buck to fund the most elusive quality in American filmmaking originality?

"Veronica Mars | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; veronica-mars ) Veronica Mars (United States 2014) March 13 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Veronica Mars is a delightful piece of fan service - a supersized TV reunion episode expanded for viewing in movie theaters. Warner Brothers unsure of the filmas box office potential has chosen an unusual distribution model. Simultaneous with the theatrical opening (in a few hundred venues) the film is being made available for digital download. The hope is that Veronica Mars die-hards will pay for a ticket to see it on the big screen then go home and buy a copy for their collection. The success of this approach could determine not only whether there will be a Veronica Mars 2 but how studios approach other potential franchises with embedded fan bases. The degree to which Veronica Mars works is proportional to the vieweras familiarity with the defunct 2004-2007 TV series. Funded by fans and directed by showrunner Rob Thomas this is an unapologetic valentine. Those with limited exposure to Veronica Mars will see this as a bloated unexceptional mystery/thriller with a charismatic lead and a lumbering plot. True believers however will love the seemingly endless stream of cameos (it seems like everyone who ever appeared in the series gets a least a few seconds of screen time) and the chance to spend a couple of hours with their favorite heroine. As with Star Trek The Motion Picture the television-to-movie pioneer the filmas flaws become increasingly apparent the farther back one steps. The movie picks up six or seven years after the series ended so the real-time gap matches the one in the charactersa lives. Veronica (Kristen Bell) has moved on from sleuthing. Now living in New York she has completed law school and is vying for a competitive job at a high profile firm. She and her boyfriend Piz (Chris Lowell) are tossing around the idea of committed couple-dom. Thatas when she learns that a former schoolmate from Neptune has been murdered and her One True Love Logan (Jason Dohring) is the prime suspect. Of course Veronica wants to help. At Loganas behest she flies cross country to help him choose a lawyer. Her PI instincts tell her something isnat right and despite some gentle dissuasion from her father Keith (Enrico Colantoni) she starts to look into the killing. Her efforts uncover widespread police corruption and a secret pact among some people with whom she attended high school. The faithfulness evidenced by Rob Thomas to the established fan base is laudable. Veronica Mars is their dream project. The film moves the title characteras life forward gives viewers a chance to reconnect with their favorites without bogging things down with too much narrative and makes some significant changes to the overall Veronica Mars landscape. The ending leaves open the possibility of sequels or possibly a TV/web-based series. Unfortunately if Thomasa goal was to expand the playing field and aopen upa Veronica Mars to a larger audience he has failed. Thereas little here to attract or interest non-fans. The mystery is tepid and often overwhelmed by callbacks to the series. The romance between Veronica and Logan works only for those familiar with the previous interaction between these two. And the police corruption angle is odd and underdeveloped. Kristen Bell shines as Veronica playing the character as a more mature version of her TV persona. While age may have softened some of Veronicaas sharpest edges it hasnat fundamentally altered her makeup. Although Bellas scenes with Jason Dohringas Logan lack a certain spark thereas real warmth and humanity when she shares the screen with Enrico Colantoni. In terms of interpersonal interaction those father/daughter moments are among the filmas best - genuine and heartfelt. Many original Veronica Mars cast members have returned although there are a few re-casts. aNamea actors like Jamie Lee Curtis and James Franco add a little star power in small parts. Regardless of how it performs at the box office and what the critics have to say about it Veronica Mars offers a reminder that at least for productions with devoted fans TV cancelation isnat necessarily a graveyard. For those who participated in the Kickstarter campaign that resurrected Veronica Mars this will be seen as an unqualified success. For everyone else itas a made-for-TV quality product that probably isnat worth the price of admission.

Carl Wilson The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 14 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Mar. 14 2014 1021AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Rob Thomas Written by Rob Thomas Diane Ruggiero Starring Kristen Bell Classification PG Country USA Language English Veronica Mars is unique in the history of filmmaking in that almost anyone qualified to review it is likely to be one of its financial backers.Thats due to the 5.7-million (U.S.) Kickstarter campaign that convinced Warner Bros. to go ahead with a film sequel to a low-rated three-season TV series about a teen detective that was cancelled seven years ago. If youre enough of a fan to judge whether it does justice to the original as I am odds are you chipped in as I did. That presents a conflict for a critic but a bigger one for its creator writer-director Rob Thomas whos admitted that it prompted him to take a ""give the people what they want"" fan-service approach. The result is 107 minutes crammed with cameos callbacks and catch-ups with the characters from the small screen. The sentimentalist in me smiled and chuckled at each one; and for fans that makes this film a must. But the whole is less than the parts especially if I put myself in the place of a newcomer to the Mars cosmos.The voiceover recap at the top of the film cant convey the series magic - a fact that it cops to with reliably self-aware wit by having Veronica sigh midway ""Trust me I know how dumb that sounds."" Veronica Mars was partly a Nancy Drew update with 21st-century technology and sexual and social mores. But more importantly it was a noir that depicted its suburban-California surfing-and-software setting Neptune as riddled with all the spiritual rot of Raymond Chandlers Bay City.Like Philip Marlowe Veronica was both above that corruption and embroiled in it mostly an honest girl in a dishonest world but not averse to deceit and manipulation to further her purposes. (Her adored but often disobeyed father Keith Mars the ousted sheriff turned P.I. was the shows true moral compass.)Veronica was also a heroine in the line of Buffy the Vampire Slayer but where that was a feminist parable about empowerment and authenticity this was a more radical story about the way that high school politics reflect and prefigure a whole world of unjust privilege. It was an adolescent House of Cards.With her chameleonic mind her case-solving needs and her own familys fragile circumstances Veronica was practically the only person in Neptune neither a wealthy-zip-code ""09er"" nor one of the underclass who either serviced or stole from the rich. (One of the shows best characters was violent Latino biker-gang leader Weevil who was smarter and more sensitive than anyone credited and returns here in endearingly - but precariously - softened-up form.)If youre not simply from the right or the wrong side of the tracks the series insisted that means you live smack dab on the rails. It had the guts to show its protagonist and her associates regularly slammed by trains loaded with social freight.Its great luck was to have Kristen Bell to inhabit Thomass vision a charismatic actress who was able to make Veronicas unlikely intelligence resourcefulness and screwball wisecracks seem completely plausible yet to convey her sadness too. Unfortunately like Buffys Sarah Michelle Gellar Bell has never been as memorable in any big-screen role. And thats a problem here - not just with Bell but with the films lighting cinematography and storyline. It all seems like an overblown TV episode.Its not that the movies too broad a canvas. Its too narrow. Veronica Mars had one perfect season its first in which the mystery involved the death of her rich party-girl best friend Lilly Kane (played by a then-unknown luminous Amanda Seyfried who is not in the movie). Even before the series began that case had wrecked Veronicas romantic and social life as well as her fathers career (because he refused as sheriff to accept conventional wisdom about the culprit) and had seemingly driven her alcoholic mother to abandon the family.The stakes were never again so high but over the flawed remaining seasons the writers had space to weave emotional aftershocks and Veronicas outsider anguish into the storyline so that that initial depth was never completely lost. The closest the movie gets to that sophistication is the now-overeducated Veronicas indecision about whether to backslide to her investigative ways or to take a job at a New York corporate law firm headed by Jamie Lee Curtis whose vibrant presence at least makes it a fairer fight - as does Veronicas relationship with good boy Piz (Chris Lowell) whos filled out winningly (and gotten a job on public radios This American Life which comes complete with an affable Ira Glass walk-on) since his days as the much-viewer-maligned rival to star-crossed lover Logan (Jason Dohring).While Veronicas career conundrum is mostly here to sustain tension while Veronica hangs with the old posse the movie tries to lend it gravitas with an extended ""addiction"" metaphor. This is weirdly detached from her moms backstory and it undermines Veronicas character which was never about mere thrill-seeking but about her compulsive need to get at the truth behind social facades.The surfeit of characters past references and clever updates doesnt permit any of them to expand in complexity. I have no idea what the uninitiated will make of this polished-up Logan for instance beyond Dohrings hunkiness. Canadian actor Enrico Colatoni as Keith Mars does get to display the constantly tested but unwavering love that made for one of the most moving father-daughter relationships ever on TV. Ryan Hansens Dick Casablancas remains a hilarious idiot. But personalities such as Tina Majorinos Mac and Percy Daggss Wallace - Veronicas ""Scooby Gang"" in the series - are little more than tokens.If the central mystery had pivoted on one of them it might have reintroduced audiences to Veronicas more soulful appeal. Instead the plot hangs on legal accusations against rich bad boy Logan (a frequent motif in the series) that turn out to involve an I Know What You Did Last Summer-style intrigue with a bunch of minor characters. What unfolds conforms superficially to the series class-conflict blueprint but with few of the ambiguities and inherent compromises that once made Veronicas borderline position mesmerizing.As a fan Id love to see VM develop into the franchise its creators want so that these characters would come back to visit and we could keep following Veronicas life. But as a moviegoer I have to say that that broader success isnt earned here. You are much better off getting the Season 1 DVD to understand why many of us invested emotionally and financially in this tiny annoying blonde whose sparky banter is just a counterweight to her vertigo in a world forever upside down.

"Review Veronica Mars welcomes the old gang back for familiar fun - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Veronica Mars welcomes the old gang back for familiar fun Veronica Mars Movie Review by Betsy Sharkey Betsy Sharkey reviews Veronica Mars starring Kristen Bell Enrico Colantoni Francis Capra and Percy Daggs. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Betsy Sharkey reviews Veronica Mars starring Kristen Bell Enrico Colantoni Francis Capra and Percy Daggs. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""Veronica Mars"" the movie is just so Veronica Mars.The teenage private eye from the 2004-07 TV series starring Kristen Bell has grown up. But like fans of the show a.k.a. marshmallows it is quickly clear that while Veronica may have left her life in Neptune Calif. behind she hasnt moved on. Director Rob Thomas creator of the prime-time show and series executive producer Diane Ruggiero finally do what they refused to do when ""Veronica Mars"" was canceled in 2007 -- deliver a script that ties up a lot of loose ends and opens up a new can of worms.BEST MOVIES OF 2013 Turan | Sharkey | Olsen Nearly everyone in the original cast is back so it makes sense to have the film coincide with Veronicas 10-year high school reunion because it does feel like a reunion. Or it will for fans.I hate to keep mentioning the fans but its impossible not to. They -- or at least 91585 of them -- basically bought and paid for the film via Kickstarter. And it is clear in every frame that the filmmakers and actors really appreciate that loyalty. It doesnt make for a particularly ambitious film but it is a satisfying one as it moves easy breezy over familiar terrain.The film is also designed to be accessible to the uninitiated. The opening sequence uses a sprawling montage and pithy voice-over to fill in all the necessary blanks.As the film opens Veronica is living in New York about to graduate from law school and happily engaged to Piz (Chris Lowell) who is as sweet as ever though a shade more serious. The reunion invite sits like the elephant in the room. Then word comes that Bonnie DeVille -- pop star old classmate and the girlfriend of Veronicas ex Logan (Jason Dohring) -- has been murdered and Logans been arrested. Though a possible job at a prestigious New York City law firm is on the line the undertow of Neptune is too much to resist.PHOTOS SXSW 2014 | The sceneThe appeal of ""Veronica Mars"" from the beginning on TV was the characters clever mix of self-awareness intelligence teenage insecurities crackling dialogue and an old-school style of sleuthing. All those qualities in a more adult form make their way to the big screen right along with Bell who slips into character like an old pair of jeans.Without the luxury of an entire season to spin out the mysteries there arent as many layers for Veronica to peel back. But there are enough to make it interesting to guess whom the murderer might be and whether Veronica and Logan will reconnect.As the old familiars reappear one by one you see the deep legacy the show has had. Most of the actors have very visible careers led by Bell with a popular Showtime series ""House of Lies"" and a hit movie ""Frozen.""The core Neptune clique headed by Gia (Krysten Ritter) and Luke (Sam Huntington) is as snarky and as entitled as ever. Former gangster ""Weevil"" Navarro (Francis Capra) has cleaned up his act. Bad boy Logan shows up looking not at all like a murderer very spiffy in military whites. Det. DAmato (Max Greenfield) slips in for a few scenes. And there are a couple of cool cameos thrown in for good measure -- look for Bells real-life husband Dax Shepard in a crowded bar and you cant miss James Franco in a clever turn as himself.PHOTOS Behind the scenes of movies and TVTheoretically Veronica is only back for a few days to help Logan pick the right defense attorney. But soon enough shes dissatisfied with how things are going and has picked up her camera broken into a prime suspects apartment -- an obsessed DeVille fan played with a nice touch of insanity by Gaby Hoffmann -- and enlisted her old sleuthing cohorts Mac (Tina Majorino) and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) to help.There is a price for coming back home again and Veronica pays in big ways and small. On the lighter side Mac and Wallace conspire to get her to the high school reunion which is of course a complete disaster. More complicated is her dads reaction.Former police chief and quintessential gumshoe Keith Mars (Enrico Colantoni) was the model dad for a rebellious teenager -- willing to give his only daughter plenty of rope but also unmovable on key issues. The one that has them at odds at the moment is her return to Neptune. Keith wants more for Veronica and is not happy watching her risk her future. Just like old times the scenes between father and daughter are among the best. Though there is a murder charge hanging over Logans head and Veronica is in the process of possibly ruining her life the film is a great deal of fun to watch as it plays around with old grudges old flames and a police force -- now headed by Sheriff Don Lamb (Jerry OConnell) -- as corrupt as ever.In a sense the film follows Veronicas story arc. There is a sense of empowerment and a new confidence in the choices being made by Thomas but there is also so much more to say. Whether a sequel or another series is in the offing the movie leaves the door wide open. That is just so Veronica Mars. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com-----------------------------------Veronica MarsMPAA rating PG-13 for sexuality including references drug content violence and some strong languageRunning time 1 hour 48 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Television Industry Kristen Bell Reviews Krysten Ritter Enrico Colantoni TCA Veronica Mars gets digital spinoff on CW Seed online network Chef Veronica Mars film set to premiere at South by Southwest PaleyFest heads to Hollywood Veronica Mars to open festival Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-veronica-mars-review-20140314,0,2034847.story#axzz2vt42Kmh0",200,veronicamars10,veronicamars,latimes

Caption After seven years of angry viewers persistently beating the drum for a movie sequel to their beloved television series a big-screen film version of ""Veronica Mars"" opens in theaters thanks to a revolutionary Kickstarter campaign that raised millions of dollars for its production all donated by fans. March 12 2014 Actress Kristen Bell attends the Los Angeles premiere of ""Veronica Mars."" Bell plays the sharp-witted teenage sleuth Veronica Mars in the detective series. Jason Kempin/Getty Images Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Stephanie Merry March 13 2014 Follow stephmerry The audience for the big screen version of ""Veronica Mars"" will probably fall into one of three camps those that loved the mid-2000s television show and would enjoy the movie even if it were a remake of ""Grown-Ups 2"" starring Kristen Bell; those that adored the teen-noir detective show and got so amped about the film that it could never live up to their expectations; and those that have never heard of Veronica Mars but think the spunky acerbic heroine seems pretty swell. Full disclosure I loved the television show. Yet I found myself curiously stuck between the first and second camps. Its good to have Veronica back particularly at what seems like a vital time given the depressing revelation that women accounted for a paltry 15 percent of leading roles in 2013 films. But the movie lacks some of the verve and chemistry that made the series a must-see. I guess that makes the movie more of a good-to-see. Still that should be enough for the people who got this story into theaters the roughly 90000 fans who contributed to a Kickstarter campaign. Series creator Rob Thomas turned to the crowd-funding site after unsuccessfully trying to get a ""Veronica Mars"" movie off the ground since the show was canceled in 2007 after just three seasons. The initial 2 million goal seemed unattainable but then the money started rolling in and 5.7 million later the demand for more sleuthing became clear to Warner Bros. which green-lit the movie. The film picks up seven years after the series ended. Former teen detective Veronica (Bell) is a lawyer now which seems about right given her talent for quippy comebacks and shes living in New York where shes dating Piz (Chris Lowell) the lovable guy she met during the third season when both were attending Hearst College. But just when you start to think how wonderful it is that Veronica ended up with a nice guy instead of brawl-happy anti-hero Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) theres news that high school classmate and pop star Carrie Bishop has turned up dead. And the main suspect is Logan. The only thing more powerful than Veronicas addiction to her ex-boyfriend is her need to solve cases so off she goes back to Neptune Calif. All the series regulars are there from Veronicas best friends Mac (Tina Majorino) and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) to her nemesis rich kid Dick (Ryan Hansen) who has turned into the man youd expect snacking on drug-laced brownies and spending his days surfing. One of the most affecting parts of the show was Veronicas relationship with her dad (Enrico Colantoni) and their same loving-yet-cantankerous bond still prompts a mix of laughter and ""awwww""-ing. Writer-director Thomas has a gift for well-paced expertly plotted stories. Theres nothing predictable about the winding mystery of Carries death. The pithy dialogue is there too although he leans heavily on self-conscious winking at those in the know. The problem with jokes about Kickstarter campaigns gibes about keeping the language PG-13 and a busker singing an acoustic version of the theme song is that those moments take the audience out of the story whereas the best movies suck us in. Luckily the action picks up when the dialogue stalls with startling car crashes cat-and-mouse games and unexpected gunshots that make for a spellbinding climax. The most distracting component of the movie may be the lackluster chemistry between Logan and Veronica. It used to be easy to understand why the two were drawn together even while they were trading hateful barbs. But now especially with Veronica in a nice stable relationship its harder to see the allure. Is it that Bell and Dohring cant muster the same pulsating attraction? Quite possibly. But it could also be that weve all grown up and Veronica should have too. Sure 90000 fans of the show wanted to see their favorite whip-smart detective do her thing at the theater but that doesnt mean we want to see her fall into all the same old patterns. ""Veronica Mars""   1/2 (107 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sexuality including references drug content violence and some strong language.

At TIFF Bell Lightbox. 99 minutes. 14ABe careful what you wish for and also what you buy into.In Veronica Mars and Stay two underwhelming new movies led by TV stars the desire to reconcile homes old and new lead to rootless characters and purposeless stories.The vastly bigger deal is Veronica Mars based on the cult 2004-07 television series of the same name starring Kristen Bell as a teenage detective living in ""the seedy beach town of Neptune California."" She took up sleuthing after her best friend was murdered and her sheriff dad Keith (Enrico Colantoni) lost his job through a series of misfortunes that made them both ""pariahs.""So goes Bells voice-over intro as the titular Veronica. She brings us briskly up to date highlighting past events that included her volatile romance with Logan (Jason Dohring) the town stud ""fuelled by rage and distrust"" -- as was Veronica before she turned into a ""marshmallow"" (as if).The fans most eagerly anticipating the Veronica Mars movie dont need the back story. Many of them would be among the nearly 92000 people who ponied up 5.7 million (U.S.) to an innovative Kickstarter campaign to will the film into existence after studios balked at a screen adaptation. Series creator and writer Rob Thomas makes his feature directing debut with the film which he also co-produced and co-wrote (with Diane Ruggiero). Many familiar faces also return looking none the worse for wear.Its a homecoming designed to check off all the boxes for the many who wrote the cheques while inadvertently leaving strangers to the cult somewhat mystified by its appeal. The movie looks and unfolds more like a pilot for the cancelled fourth Veronica Mars TV season rather than a big-screen rebuilding of the franchise. An attempt is made to demonstrate that Veronica has moved on from Neptune. An honours graduate of two law schools shes living in New York and in a relationship with dull-but-devoted Stosh ""Piz"" Piznarski (Chris Lowell) the other guy long orbiting Mars. Veronica also lands a great job at a top legal firm led by a discerning boss (Jamie Lee Curtis).So far so ""epic"" as Logan would put it. But then a local rock star is murdered in Neptune Logan is blamed for it and Veronica finds herself dragged back to her hometown not only to play sleuth but also to attend the 10th anniversary high school reunion shed always planned to miss.By this point the movie is like pressing ""play"" on a PVR for a story laden with shout-outs but short on substance. Wisecracking Veronica dutifully assumes her old gumshoe duties falling yet again for the newly mature Logan (hes now a full-dress military man) who really and truly needs her.She runs into such usual suspects as her sleuthing sidekicks Wallace (Percy Daggs III) Mac (Tina Majorino) and Weevil (Francis Capra) all in various stages of growing up.Fans will smile at these and other encounters. But the more demanding of them not to mention newcomers might wonder if the movie needed to be kick-started with something more than money and whether theres any need for a sequel. Its a serious puzzle worthy of a Veronica Mars investigation.Stay has even less reason for being. Chances are it would have headed straight to video after its tour of the festival circuit including TIFF last fall were it not for the lead presence of Taylor Schilling star of the current hit Netflix series Orange is the New Black.Directed by Wiebke von Carolsfeld a German-born Canadian filmmaker who showed such promise with her 2002 debut Marion Bridge (a Best Canadian First Feature winner at TIFF) its a romantic drama as aimless as tumbleweed.Schilling plays Abbey a Montreal woman in her mid-20s who now resides in a rustic farmhouse in Ireland on the windswept coast outside Galway. Shes living with her lover Dermot (Aidan Quinn) a whiskered former university professor of checkered history who is twice her age.Whatever poetry Abbey found in this setup initially seems to have abated as indicated by her doleful looks and uncertain stance. Dermot meanwhile is happy with his daily ritual of beer chips books and world-class scenery.The situation seems ripe for upset. It comes when Abbey learns shes pregnant much to Dermots chagrin ""Its just not for me"" he fumes.Abbey reluctantly returns home to Montreal while she and Dermot reflect on their situation but ""home"" for her is always a difficult concept. Her mother long ago left the scene and her alcoholic father (Michael Ironside) always well-intentioned hasnt got much to offer either as a dad or a potential granddad.Stay is in much the same muddle not sure of what it wants to do or say.The uninvolving characters are little more than sketches especially the secondary ones who lard out a story that includes a capitalist vs. preservationist tussle over an archeological discovery.Von Carolsfeld adapts the story from a 2002 novel by Vancouver author Aislinn Hunter and its clear that screenwriting isnt this directors forte. She was so much more in command with Marion Bridge which was penned by Daniel MacIvor the Toronto playwright filmmaker and actor. With Stay von Carolsfeld just drifts.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Pictures)Shes a TV cult favorite a latter-day and much hipper Nancy Drew.Now seven years after the beloved television series ended Veronica Mars has her own movie.Fans of the underrated TV show helped to bankroll the movie with a Kickstarter campaign an Internet-based crowd-funding effort.The result is the engaging Veronica Mars ( of four; rated PG-13; opening Friday in select cities) a film noir detective story that works for both devotees of the series and the uninitiated.Kristen Bell reprises the sassy sleuth role she played for three TV seasons. Shes as sharp engaging and witty as ever. Maturity has only made her more charming.Directed by series creator Rob Thomas the film works as a suspense thriller and also as a gentle send-up of the genre. Its effective as a sequel to the television series and works just as well as a stand-alone film.STORY Veronica Mars movie release is like nothing on EarthVIDEO Veronica Mars gets closureREVIEWS Coming soon to theatersTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersVeronica (Bell) has just graduated from Stanford Law School and seems on her way to an illustrious career at a high-powered New York law firm. Shes romantically involved with handsome former boyfriend Stosh ""Piz"" Piznarski (Chris Lowell). Things are looking good for Veronicas smooth transition to successful adulthood.But a shocking murder of a former high school classmate lures her back to the sleepy corrupt beach town of Neptune Calif. much to the chagrin of her loving dad Keith Mars (Enrico Colantoni). Formerly the towns sheriff Keith became a private investigator after being forced out of office by a venal but powerful local millionaire. Keith wants nothing more than for Veronica to stay out of Neptunes orbit.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) heads back to her high school (and investigative ways) to solve the murder of a former friend. One of the highlights of the series was the affectionate and dryly humorous relationship between father and daughter. That sweet bond with its fast-paced dialogue continues to flourish here.While it seemed her sleuthing days were behind her Veronica is drawn back into crime-solving.Her former high school flame Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) is suspected of the murder of their classmate. As the best amateur detective around Veronica is clearly the ideal candidate to dig up evidence to exonerate him.Handily Veronica comes home just in time for her 10-year high school reunion. Soon shes being pulled back into the life she had tried to leave behind aided and abetted by her brainy high school pals Cindy ""Mac"" Mackenzie (Tina Majorino) and Wallace Fennel (Percy Daggs III).Veronicas a feisty heroine and a strong role model for girls. Its certainly been a good year for Bell as an actress after voicing the spunky younger sister in the massively successful Oscar-winning Disney animated feature Frozen. Supporting characters in this low-budget feature are believable -- with the most well-loved folks from the series making reappearances. The jokes are savvy and the Hitchcock-style thriller aspects draw us in.Thomas a novice film director could have made some scenes more visually intriguing but he was hampered by a tight shooting schedule and limited budget. Still the well-paced mystery doesnt suffer from these constraints. His years as a high school teacher serve him well in nailing how teens actually talk intensified by an extra dose of cleverness.Veronicas return to her youthful detective avocation and her beachfront hometown is rewarding emotionally for fans -- with its inside jokes show references and winks -- but also satisfying for those who arent familiar with her. Bell was able to pick up right where she left off with the series.Who says you cant go home again? 406 CONNECTTWEET 2 LINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1iGzvHA",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/03/13/veronica-mars-movie-review/5808665/,200,veronicamars13,veronicamars,usatoday

Photo Credit AP / Robert Voets advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A former private eye returns to her corrupt hometown to help a desperate friend. Rated PG-13 (sexuality drug content violence) BOTTOM LINE Essentially an additional episode of the canceled television series with all the characters and in-jokes that fans will expect. The rest of us arent really invited. CAST Kristen Bell Jason Dohring Chris Lowell LENGTH 148 When we last left Veronica Mars the teenage private eye played by Kristen Bell she was investigating crime and corruption in seaside Neptune Calif. Unfortunately she ran afoul of a ruthless syndicate the suits at The CW network who canceled ""Veronica Mars"" after three seasons in 2007. Despite an outcry from fans who sent the network more than 10000 Mars candy bars our heroine vanished leaving her case-files open and her love triangle unresolved. Years later fans found a better strategy than mass-mailing nougat. In a now-famous show of viewer muscle they funded a ""Veronica Mars"" movie spearheaded by show creator Rob Thomas at the crowdfunding site Kickstarter. By the time the movies funding period closed in March 2013 it had broken Kickstarter records for the most money raised 5.7 million. Even now its the sites third most-funded project.

Thats an impressive and heartwarming story but the result is a movie literally by and for the fans. ""Veronica Mars"" isnt really a movie but another episode -- and not even a grand finale -- with all the familiar characters and in-jokes that viewers expect. To those coming in midseason as it were it has less to offer. Its teen-soap plot is mostly an excuse to bring back beloved faces. Veronica now a Columbia law grad reluctantly returns to Neptune to prove that her ex-boyfriend Logan (Jason Dohring) didnt murder his pop-star lover Bonnie DeVille (Andrea Estella replacing Leighton Meester). Enrico Colantonti is back as her father Keith Mars. Coincidentally its also Veronicas 10-year high school reunion which means catching up with old friends and nemeses. James Franco plays himself in a semi-amusing cameo. 215 MoviesVeronica Mars movie trailer Functionally written and directed by Thomas ""Veronica Mars"" should be a happy event for longtime viewers. Since its available via video-on-demand even they might prefer to see it on the small screen just like in the old days. advertisement | advertise on newsday PLOT A former private eye returns to her corrupt hometown to help a desperate friend.

This is very good news for fans of the original 2004 - 2007 suspense-comedy series about a girl detective but in practical terms its irrelevant to anyone else. Veronica (Kristen Bell) has fled the sleepy corrupt town of Neptune CA to go to law school but events in Neptune yank her back Ex-boyfriend Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) is accused of murdering his rock-star girlfriend.

Grade B- In movies as diverse as ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" (2008) and ""When in Rome"" (2010) Kristen Bell has been a first-rate comic actor with a mastery of pert fed-up sometimes wistful deliveries. In ""Fanboys"" (2009) she was a subtle and beguiling parodist echoing the spunky curvy tomboys of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg epics circa 1975 to 1983. She proved she could hold the big screen long before she gave voice to the perky sister in the Disney smash ""Frozen."" So its ironic that she may become an honest-to-God movie star in the title role of ""Veronica Mars"" the movie version of her cult TV show which ran on UPN and the CW from 2004 to 2007. Already hailed (and disparaged) as the first bona fide Hollywood production to be funded by Kickstarter ""Veronica Mars"" is an agreeable light entertainment. But it begs the question Are the quirks a character masters as a teen just as dynamic when she hits her 20s? Veronica is as quick-witted as ever but without the frisson of adolescent precocity her quips can fall flat. Theres something too nostalgic and self-indulgent about jokes like ""I knew the felonies before I knew the state capitals."" In the series a wholesome-looking high school girl wised up fast as she reacted to her own date rape the murder of her best friend Lilly (Amanda Seyfried) and the public disgrace of her sheriff father Keith (Enrico Colantoni) for accusing Lillys tech-tycoon dad of being the murderer. When Keith Mars became a private eye Veronica also became a gumshoe using her new skills to champion misfits and underdogs. There were plenty in Neptune a Southern California coastal town with a thick upper crust a gritty underbelly and almost no middle-class; Veronica predicts that in a future class war Neptune will be ""ground zero."" The people who rule it are ""09ers"" named for an exclusive zip code. At the movies start we learn that she transferred from the fictional Hearst College to Stanford where she earned a degree in psychology before studying law at Columbia. At a job interview she tells a high-powered Manhattan lawyer (Jaime Lee Curtis) that she got her investigators license at age 18 because she had an addictive compulsive personality. She swears shes not that way any more. She even has a loving boyfriend - Stosh ""Piz"" Piznarski (Chris Lowell) - who works for Ira Glass (cue cameo) at NPR. But when her troubled true love Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) gets accused of murdering his rock-star girlfriend he reaches out to Veronica for advice - and she comes running. She arrives in Neptune right around the time of her 10th class reunion. If like me you didnt follow ""Veronica Mars"" as it unfolded on TV (I caught up to the first season on streaming video) watching this movie is like going to someone elses class reunion. As the ""marshmallows"" in the audience applaud Veronicas friends Mac (Tina Majorino) Wallace (Percy Daggs III) and Weevil (Francis Capra III) or chortle over jerks like Dick Casablancas (Ryan Hansen) you understand their emotions even if you dont always share them. The weakest link is fan favorite Dohring. His Logan has mellowed too darn much. Dohring looks ship-shape in crisp Navy whites but he fails to convey the depth and charisma that drew Veronica to him. He underplays his elusive charm as if embarrassed that hes so hard to resist. Outsiders may think Veronica is more in tune with Lowells Piznarski who at least has a pungent sense of humor. The murdered woman Carrie Bishop was a classmate of Veronicas. The mystery at the center of the movie resembles the ones that permeate Laura Lippman best-sellers like ""The Power of Three"" in which a violent episode haunts a small circle of friends. Youd think that premise would be perfect for a series or a high school reunion but the director Rob Thomas who also created the TV show rarely makes it work. Thomas and his co-writer Diane Ruggiero laboriously build Veronicas search for the real killer around her reconnection to old enemies and frenemies. A swamp-like miasma should bubble up from the tarnished group of 09ers but Thomas doesnt sustain a sick yet seductive atmosphere. The movie is set in one small town but tonally its all over the place. So are the multiple subplots. Colantoni and Bell continue to tap playful respectful father-daughter vibes. Hes such a good actor he can put genuine feeling into cardboard lines like ""my daughter the big-shot New York lawyer - youre destined for greatness."" The movie proves you can go home again. But it will take a better sequel to decide whether you want to. Contact the writer msragowocregister.com Most Popular U.S. Open of Surfing Will you marry me?

"Veronica Mars movie review by Michael Phillips - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies REVIEW Veronica Mars  Veronica Mars Robert Voets/Warner Bros. Kristen Bell stars in ""Veronica Mars."" Kristen Bell stars in ""Veronica Mars."" (Robert Voets/Warner Bros.) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Everything about the way the movie version of ""Veronica Mars"" came to pass is more intriguing than the movie itself.Canceled in 2007 by the CW network after three seasons creator Rob Thomas wised-up danger magnet of a teenage sleuth portrayed by Kristen Bell left the shows ardent core audience hungry for more. Then God created Kickstarter and nearly 100000 fans contributed 5.7 million to the campaign bringing Ms. Mars her detective pop and various skeezes and climbers residing in the fictional corrupt beach town of Neptune Calif. to the big screen. Warners said fine lets do it. The resulting crowdfunded feature is the first major studio release to open in theaters and online simultaneously. The film which is adequate  cares not about the newbies. Although ""Veronica Mars"" does its duty in identifying the major characters on the fly as they make their entrances and get out of the way this ones strictly for the fan base.The films air of take-it-or-leave-it has its charms but the murder mystery itself isnt one of them. Series creator Thomas directs the film which he co-wrote with series producer Diane Ruggiero. Now in Manhattan and about to become a highly compensated and therefore soulless attorney (Jamie Lee Curtis has a too-brief scene as a legal bigwig) Veronica has settled into a placid relationship with Piz (Chris Lowell) from the series. Then trouble back in Neptune Veronicas former classmate Bonnie DeVille (Andrea Estella) a self-destructive pop star dating Veronicas ex-boyfriend is electrocuted in a bathtub. Prime suspects include the boyfriend Logan played by series fave Jason Dohring so low-key he threatens to drift off to some other movie when nobodys looking. Logan contacts Veronica for legal advice. She returns to Neptune and the movie is off and running or rather off and gliding painlessly dropping the occasional witty one-liner about tantric sex or James Franco the latter making a cameo.As the heroines genial dad Enrico Colantoni remains a chief asset and his father/daughter rapport with Bell is well-established. On the other hand ... the leads are so comfortable in their grooves the movie proceeds at a scarily low pulse rate even when people end up in intensive care and more bodies are found.If there are to be more of these movies -- Thomas has Veronica Mars novels planned and ready to go -- it wouldnt hurt to pay more attention to the mystery inside the story.

Area theaters. ""Veronica Mars"" is hardly the first major film made for fans. But thanks to a historic crowdfunding campaign this is the first movie made by them. Its evident in every carefully crafted scene that director Rob Thomas wants to please the 91585 Kickstarter backers who were determined to see his young TV detective move to the multiplex. So congratulations loyalists. Veronicas return is everything youve hoped it would be. Its so much fun you may want to put a few bucks aside for a sequel. Jason Dohring and Kristen Bell in Veronica Mars (Robert Voets) Thomas show also called ""Veronica Mars"" ended in 2007 after three cultishly beloved -- but dismally rated -- seasons. Back then Veronica (perfectly embodied then as now by Kristen Bell) was a college student working with her private investigator dad (Enrico Colantoni) in Neptune Calif. Much to the annoyance of many viewers Veronica was dating the bland Piz (Chris Lowell) despite her obvious chemistry with bad-boy ex Logan (Jason Dohring). Thomas brings us up to date with a swift but skillful prologue which also serves as a useful introduction for newcomers. No longer a feisty teen investigator Veronica is now an aspiring corporate lawyer living with Piz in New York. Kristen Bell a youthful investigator in the TV series is now an attorney. (Robert Voets) But her new life falls away as soon as she hears that Logan is being framed for murder. She races home to Neptune to help him meeting up with old friends (Percy Daggs III Francis Capra Tina Majorino) and enemies (Krysten Ritter Ken Marino) while trying to uncover the real killer. Thomas finds witty ways to bring back nearly every major character. Ryan Hansens fantastically idiotic surfer dude Dick is one highlight. But the real thrill is in seeing Veronica reunite with her two ideally matched leading men Colantoni perhaps the best TV dad this century and Dohring who still plays Logans dual nature just right. Bell is entangled once again in a crime caper and runs into several old friends along the way. (Robert Voets) Since Thomas is literally beholden to viewers hes taken unusual care to expand his ambitions while retaining the intimacy of his creation. Thats not easy; just ask Chris Carter who so grandly flubbed Mulder and Scullys 2008 return to the big screen in ""The X-Files I Want to Believe."" ""Veronica Mars"" does actually feel like an expanded if especially well made television episode. So if youve never seen the series feel free to knock a star off this review. With no prior knowledge of the backstory youll get an entertaining but unremarkable mystery. The interested but uninitiated should try to watch at least some of the show before seeing the movie. But its OK that this project was designed with the faithful in mind -- and celebrates fandom itself. There should always be room for smartly conceived experiments. And maybe Bells strong complex heroine will now get the mass recognition she deserves. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Starring Kristen Bell Jason Dohring Chris Lowell and Gaby Hoffman. Directed by Rob Thomas. (PG-13. 107 minutes.) The ""Veronica Mars"" movie was going to be a victory for fandom even if the finished product was 107 minutes of Kristen Bell reading thank you notes to supporters. The television show by the same name was canceled in 2007 after three seasons on UPN and the CW leaving loose ends and a devoted fan base demanding a movie. When the studio waffled lead actress Bell and creator Rob Thomas helped raise 5.7 million on crowdfunding site Kickstarter to get the Warner Bros. film made. The movie is practically gift-wrapped for fans many of whom will actually see themselves on screen. (Being an extra in the movie was one of the Kickstarter lures.) Newcomers will be less pleased discovering a product that looks and feels like a scaled-up television show. The inside jokes and receiving line of nudge-wink cameos only adds to the small-screen feel. ""Veronica Mars"" was a very good TV show starting with a detective procedural foundation and adding a self-referential wit. Bell was an outstanding heroine and the writing was smart enough to convince viewers that this gorgeous and extremely capable girl could be a high school misfit. All of these qualities continue in the ""Veronica Mars"" movie. More in Movies Review Elaine Stritch Shoot Me Ready for her close-up? Generation War review German WWII film causes some unease Need for Speed review Too long but certainly not slow Grand Budapest Hotel review Wes Anderson at his best Also returning The contrived supporting characters bad boy/good girl romantic tropes and a central mystery that appears to have been salvaged from the discard bin of a lesser ""Law amp; Order"" spinoff. The film begins with Mars flying from New York to California to help former flame Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) who is the prime suspect in the murder of a generic pop star. Funny situations mix with ""Scooby Doo"" plot twists and a lot of awkward excuses to cram in glimpses of regulars on the TV show. The protagonists detective skills are augmented by her willingness to cross moral and ethical lines a la Eddie Murphys Axel Foley which probably played better when her character was 17 years old. The age of the protagonists is a problem throughout the movie. Mars was appealing in part because she was a too-smart-for-the-cool-kids outcast. As a beautiful and intelligent 28-year-old who has seen the world it seems strange that Mars continues to act disenfranchised. Echolls an attractive hothead in his teens seemingly has considerably less to offer a decade later. Veronica should have moved on but her conflicts mostly rest in high school drama. The intangibles however are all in favor of ""Veronica Mars."" The film has a reunion feel - including an actual high school reunion - that fills the movie with good vibes. The subtle infectiousness is reminiscent of the first ""Star Trek"" movies. The actors director and crew are clearly very grateful to be making this film and that feeling seeps into the theater. Although most of the actors beyond Bell arent big film stars Jamie Lee Curtis gets a few minutes of screen time and James Franco makes a spectacularly self-deprecating cameo. Whatever they contributed to the Kickstarter campaign it was worth every cent. Peter Hartlaub is The San Francisco Chronicles pop culture critic.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet ""People say Im a marshmallow"" quips the titular once-teenage gumshoe of Veronica Mars in an early tip of the hat to all the self-described marshmallows in the audience. The shout-out is appropriate Without the emotional and financial support of the diehards this crowd-funded revival--a big-screen extension of a canceled small-screen gem--would never have made it into multiplexes. Thankfully the Veronica Mars movie wastes only a fraction of its precious running time on such winks and nudges. (Theres also an acoustic rendition of the Dandy Warhols anthem that kicked off each episode.) But for better and worse series creator Rob Thomas has crafted a feature-length exercise in fan service--a game if slightly futile attempt to condense a whole seasons worth of detective work SoCal melodrama and whip-smart banter into one load-bearing film.The strain shows though not fatally. After an opening montage of footage from the series assembled as a courtesy to the uninitiated Veronica Mars gets down to throat-clearing business bridging the gap between the inconclusive finale of season three and the status quo of this seven-years-later continuation. Veronica (Kristen Bell back in the role of a lifetime) now lives in Manhattan having abandoned the investigator business for a more lucrative career in lawyering. Shes also committed to Piz (Chris Lowell) that drippy nice guy she met in college whose appeal always seemed strictly limited to his habit of not punching people in the face. Speaking of which Its bad boy ex-boyfriend Logan (Jason Dohring) accused of the murder of his pop-star squeeze who draws Veronica back to the seedy sunny stomping grounds of Neptune California. Here she reluctantly takes the case falling back into old habits and into the company of old allies and foes. (That theme song about being friends a long time ago suddenly has added resonance.)Veronica Mars smartly frames its story as one of compulsive backsliding Just as fans could never quite quit this indelible character Veronica finds it difficult to cold turkey the Philip Marlowe lifestyle to say nothing of the addictive allure of her trouble-prone former flame. Swirling its crime-fiction intrigue around a high school reunion the film plays like a reunion itself deftly reintroducing the various figures caught in Veronicas orbit--her aging private-eye father (Enrico Colantoni) comic cretin foil Dick (Ryan Hansen) the heroines assorted sidekicks and nemeses. Every cameo appearances feels organic. No callback feels forced. As a nostalgia trip and a valentine to the virtues of its terrific source material Veronica Mars gets the job done.As a whodunit however it leaves a bit to be desired. Forget murderous celebrities venomous rich kids and the heavy hand of the local law This time the biggest obstacle Veronica faces is an abbreviated timeframe. On television Bells brainy snoop had season-long arcs in which to work her magic--and so too did Thomas who could plant clues and red herrings across hours of plot the episodic format allowing him to create a sprawling ensemble of suspects. Working here with the running-time equivalent of about two episodes Thomas constructs a much less compelling mystery cutting corners to conform his serialized storytelling style to the demands of a one-and-done feature. Hes no master stylist either; hopes that Veronica Mars would finally gain a noir aesthetic to complement its neo-noir subject matter are dashed by the televisual visuals. (Though to be fair the series always strove to juxtapose the darkness of its themes with the brightness of its environment.)Of course many fell in love with Veronica Mars not for its detective-yarn plotting but for its sharp characterizations and soapy romantic entanglements. Even in that regard however the movie falls a little short Piz remains an obvious Baxter an embodiment of the ""normal"" life Veronica thinks she wants so the love triangle feels a bit perfunctory. And Logan once a volatile presence has softened with age into a mellower heartthrob not so different from the dull nerd hes competing against for his exs affection. At its best the series made one wonder if this wealthy hothead was right for Veronica; by catering to Team Logan Thomas extinguishes that tension. For the most part Veronica Mars plays like a very solid episode of the series the kind unlikely to rank among fan favorites. It could however serve as fine fuel for a sequel one that wouldnt find Veronica resisting--for half of her time on screen--the urge to do what she does best. Keep your hearts (and wallets) open marshmallows.

"The Veronica Mars movie reviewed Kickstarter-funded feature is just like the TV series and thats great. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Veronica Mars Movie Is More of the Same and Thats a Beautiful Thing The Veronica Mars Movie Is More of the Same and Thats a Beautiful Thing Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateTelevisionWhat youre watching.March 12 2014 623 PM The Veronica Mars Movie Is Just More of the Same And thats a beautiful thing. By Willa Paskin Kristen Bell as Veronica Mars may look like a cutie patootie but she projects an icy hauteur and impatient intelligence. Photo courtesy Robert Voets/Warner Bros. I cannot speak to the experience of watching the new Kickstarter-funded Veronica Mars movie without ever having seen Veronica Mars the teen-detective TV series that ran for three seasons on UPN and then the CW from 2004 to 2007. But as someone who did watch--and love--the show my recommendation to those of you who have not is Go watch the series all of it then wait seven years. Then watch the film. Does that sound insane? The surge of delayed gratification that will wash over you upon being reunited with Veronica Mars the surliest of blonds and her snap-crackling fictional universe will make it worthwhile. For those reasonable people unwilling to undergo this exercise in both binge-watching and self-denial be aware that the film plays like an extended excellent episode of the show a distinction I do not mean as an insult but a compliment The Veronica Mars movie is exactly what the people paid for and what they paid for is more TV. Willa Paskin Willa Paskin is Slates television critic. More than most films which arrive in theaters with both artistic and financial expectations the audience is aware of the Veronica Mars movie comes to us as both a piece of entertainment and a new sort of commercial product. A year ago the shows creator Rob Thomas launched a Kickstarter campaign for the movie that raised twice as much money as needed in a record amount of time and immediately suggested a whole new semi-crowd-sourced way to fund certain projects. (Warner Bros. kicked in funds as well.) The movie is being released in theaters and on VOD simultaneously this Friday and how it performs economically and artistically will have bearing on what happens next Is this just the first film of this kind or will it also be one of the last? I dont know how much money Veronica Mars will make or how much money it has to make to be deemed a success but as means of fan-satisfaction it is a needle to a major vein. Unlike the new structurally complex Arrested Development Veronica Mars only ambition seems to be to deliver a product of the same quality as the incisive quippy show--not at all a low bar. By unapologetically being an extended TV-episode in movie form Veronica Mars keeps on keeping on with its major theme taking things that are assumed to be adorable and unserious and safe and complicating the hell out of them. The Veronica Mars movie is an object lesson in what TV can do that movies cant. Advertisement The show told the story of a teenage PI a blonde resident of Neptune Calif. who starts solving crimes for her classmates. This description conjures to mind something cute and fluffy but Veronica Mars is about as cute and fluffy as a mangy underfed hyena. Kristen Bell who plays Mars may look like a cutie patootie but she projects an icy hauteur and impatient intelligence. If the show sounds like a light-teen drama week in and week out it was a surprisingly witty detective caper about class warfare starring a newly unpopular heroine whose best friend had died and whose mother had left who channeled her sadness and rage into a relentless OCD hunt for various truths in a beach town as seedy as it was posh. The movie picks up 10 years after the show ended (basically so Veronica can attend her high-school reunion) and immediately begins grappling once again with deceptive appearances. Veronica has spent a decade becoming an upstanding and mentally healthy citizen a ""marshmallow"" in the shows parlance. She transferred to Stanford got a law degree is up for a big job at a fancy firm (shes interviewed by Jamie Lee Curtis one of the celebrities to make a cameo) and is in a relationship with nice guy Piz (Chris Lowell) and has not worked a case in years. She is finally the normal woman everyone always assumed her to be. But then Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) Veronicas very troubled totally true love gets arrested for murder. (The chemistry between Veronica and Logan is another one of the shows mysteries; ice princess meets sporadically fey bad boy does not sound like a recipe for a destabilizing-ly hubba-hubba relationship but this is just another way Veronica Mars teaches us not to judge couples by their cover.) Veronica gets pulled in for one last case a bad decision she makes both helplessly and knowingly even as her beloved father looks on disapprovingly. Top Comment Of course Veronicas bored.  Shes spent ten years with Piz.  More... -Not great Bob Join In The recurring theme in her voice-over is one of addiction Veronica knows she is making unhealthy choices but she cant stop herself partly because she loves the drama (and Logan) and also because she is bored out of her mind. The movie is a kind of superhero story but a little perverse; the hero has to be reborn but she can only do so by giving into her own not-particularly-healthy flaws and accepting that she thrives in a not-particularly-healthy place. There are thing about this film that will aggravate people who have never seen the show the aforementioned voice-over the endless parade of characters they are clearly supposed to know but dont. Even for fans the mystery itself is not particularly thrilling. (This actually mirrors long-ago complaints about the series which after its first season-long mystery never could gin up another with the same emotional heft.) But mostly the Veronica Mars movie is an object lesson in what TV can do that movies cant give its audience 60-plus hours of intimate knowledge of a huge cast of characters and their various interpersonal relationships. If you put in the time with the show watching all of those dynamics pay-off in the movie is a high-order treat. And from the looks of things theres no reason it has to be the last Veronica Mars is now poised to become as many movies as TV watchers are willing to pay for.

The film adaptation ""is akin to a killer episode"" writes Us Weeklys film critic Mara Reinstein Credit Warner Bros. In theaters Friday March 14 3 stars (out of 4 stars) PHOTOS Best and worst movie remakes Well played Marshmallows. Last year 5.7 million was raised on Kickstarter to fund a big screen version of a cult TV show that never garnered 5.7 million weekly viewers during its three seasons on the air. High donors got tickets to the premiere and walk-on roles. Low donors got a copy of Rob Thomas script. But everyone gets the big prize A pulpy and sly murder mystery that aims to please. (It also features a slew of inside jokes. See Marshmallows). So whered we leave off? Ten years have passed since our beloved dryly hilarious former teen PI (Kristen Bell all in) graduated from Neptune High. Shes now a budding NYC lawyer dating amiable impossibly bland ""Piz"" (Chris Lowell). Shes lured back home when her ex Logan (Jason Dohring) is accused of killing his girlfriend -- a famous pop singer and former classmate. PHOTOS Best movies of 2012 Not much has changed in that upper class coastal California community. Quick rundown Veronicas dad Keith (Enrico Colantoni) has resumed his sheriffs post; Wallace (Percy Daggs III) is now a coach at his alma mater; Weevil (Francis Capra) has cleaned up and rid himself of the PCHers; and Logan -- one of TVs most unlikely heartthrobs -- is still a moody brooder. He greets his Veronica with a platonic hug but it doesnt take a LoVe expert to know where this is going. And for those who are curious Teddy Dunns Duncan Kane is MIA. High school love triangles are soooo high school. Though Keith warns Veronica to stay out of laffair de Logan she just cant help herself. Soon the dogged investigator is reunited with her old pal the long-lens camera. Age has only made her sharper and snappier -- and now shes able to utilize all sorts of nifty 2014-era technological resources to aid her analysis. The victims crazy stalker (Gaby Hoffman) seems suspicious. What was up with that cryptic text? All the partiers on that doomed booze cruise need to get their alibis together too. (Its a treat to watch her grill Ryan Hansens lecherous lothario Dick Casablancas). PHOTOS Stars as superheroes Because Veronica is the kind of girl who tells it like it is lets not sugarcoat things Theres something a little -- well UPN/CW -- about the some of mysterys by-the-numbers plotting. And though donators might feel like they want to get their moneys worth even they would agree that a Weevil-in-peril subplot goes nowhere. He was fifth-billed on the opening credits for a reason As for the V-mars virgins? At times theyll be more confused than amused by the shout-outs and cameos. For that matter fans who havent seen the show since it went off the air in 2007 might leave the theater Googling ""Was Jerry OConnell ever on Veronica Mars?"" (Answer No. He was just cast in this version. But New Girls Max Greenfield was on the series and also appears here.) Still the adaptation is akin to a killer episode -- plus a few swear words and a sexy PG-13 roll in the sheets thrown in for good measure. Even James Franco pops in for a charming self-deprecating turn. The Marshmallows may do all the savoring but rest assured that this film isnt just fluff.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr LIFE ON MARS The big-screen adaptation of the TV series is delightfully entertaining (Robert Voets) B Veronica Mars Genre Comedy Crime; Starring Kristen Bell Enrico Colantoni Percy Daggs III Jason Dohring Krysten Ritter; Director Rob Thomas; Release Date Limited 03/14/2014; Runtime (in minutes) 108; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted March 26 2014 -- 1200 AM EDT Its easy to claim that Mad Men or Breaking Bad or The Wire is superior as art to almost anything youre likely to encounter in a movie theater. But when justifying the notion that ""TV is better"" thats almost too easy. How about a brightly written tartly formulaic good-but-not-great cult show like Veronica Mars? Where does it stack up on the quality totem pole of big-versus-small-screen aesthetics? The shrewd corny enjoyable film version of Veronica Mars offers a clue. By letting us see a beloved but hardly prestigious TV show on the big screen (as well as on VOD) the film gets us to see in a new way the strengths and weaknesses of weekly series television that viewers too often take for granted. Funded by a Kickstarter campaign that drew on its rabid fan base Veronica Mars updates but preserves the smartly insular Nancy Drew?meets?Buffy?meets?Emma Peel spirit of the teen-private-eye series. The film is set nine years after the show ended and it takes the young sleuth played by Kristen Bell as a perky but alienated straight shooter and turns her into a full-fledged adult who must decide if her heart is still in the game of unsolved mysteries. Of course it is. Veronica has a job waiting for her at a money-minting New York law firm but when a high school classmate?turned?rock star is found dead in the bathtub -- and the death is ruled a homicide and the suspect is Veronicas old flame Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) who was found on a sex tape with the rock star the day she died -- youd better believe Veronica will put that offer on hold and return to the cozy-but-corrupt hamlet of Neptune Calif. where biker gangs roam the bad side of town. I never really bought the plot of the Veronica Mars movie. Her investigation into a murder that has grabbed global headlines hinges on all these people she knows? And even intersects with her 10th high school reunion? Theres something impossibly small-screen quaint about it all. Yet as directed by series creator Rob Thomas the movie like the show is entertainingly fast-talking in a tidy faux-serious way. Kristen Bell if anything has only gained in appeal Shes alluringly fixated with eyes like heat-seeking missiles and a dry-martini delivery of lines like ""Kudos for rockin the stache till it came back in style"" Bell and Thomas take us back to the hard-boiled-gumshoe Hollywood of the 40s. Veronica will solve that crime because shes got something in common with whoever did it Shes addicted to the dark side.

When this big-screen spin-off from the popular but short-lived (2004-07) US TV series about a pushy teenage private detective pitched for public funding in 2012 it raised 2 million in 10 hours - a pretty breathtaking achievement. And while the movie may mean little to those who never saw the show - and here in the UK thatll be most of us - its an enjoyable enough effort nonetheless well-paced and packed with pleasingly spiky dialogue. Kristen Bell returns to the central role of Veronica now in her late twenties and ready to take a job with a high-flying NYC law firm. But when an old classmate is murdered she heads back to her old haunts hooks up with the high-school gang and gets back to what she does best. Theres something rather bland about Veronica Mars - even the murderers have neat hair and nice clothes - and the largely forgettable cast dont help. But the one-liners are sharp the plot unpredictable and the whole thing ticks along with a minimum of fuss.

Rob Thomass pleasurable fan-service-heavy reunion film an epilogue to his three-season TV series opens several years after Veronica (Kristen Bell) has left the sleuthing business and her hometown of Neptune California. Shes relocated to Manhattan with boyfriend Piz (Chris Lowell) and is being courted by a prestigious law firm whose boss in the first of several celebrity cameos is played by Jamie Lee Curtis. Then a call comes from estranged former lover Logan (Jason Dohring) whos been accused of murdering his pop-star girlfriend. How can Veronica resist dusting off her magnifying glass? Anyone who has ever loved a television show can see that Thomas and his crew are working overtime to give VM aficionados everything they want. Up to a point their desire to please is infectious even to those (like yours truly) who wouldnt know characters like Weevil or Dick Casablancas from Adam. Bell takes to her signature role with wisecracking ease and her scenes with Dohring crackle with the kind of emo Mulder/Scully tension that inspires a million slash fictions. The mystery is beside the point and indeed the whodunit is actually a whocares--a flimsy excuse to get the band back together and make winky references to episodes past. (A lengthy laborious high-school reunion sequence is so stuffed with Mars bit players and other allusional arcana that it should require its own secret handshake.) For better and for worse this is a movie where you can truly say that fans have gotten everything theyve paid for.

According to lore Liberace used to greet the tourists whod come by bus to gawk at his bejeweled home with the line ""I hope you like it. After all you paid for it"" Not everyone has to like Rob Thomass Veronica Mars the feature-length incarnation of his much-loved television series which ran from 2004 to 2007. But the fans who helped finance the movie via a ferociously successful 2013 Kickstarter campaign have every reason to like it Its been crafted affectionately for them bringing back nearly every original cast member -- chief among them Kristen Bell and Enrico Colantoni -- and instead of lifting the characters out of amber and trying to jolt their stories back to life treating them like actual human beings who have gone on living while we werent looking. For people who loved the show as I did its like fan fiction without the delusional megalomania. We dont have to keep writing these characters stories for ourselves; Thomas has done it for us -- and trust me hes better at it. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - When we last saw Bells Veronica Mars she was still a teenage detective in the small moneyed Southern California town of Neptune. Now shes a bona fide adult just out of law school and eager to start a new career in New York. Ten years out of high school she has no intention of going back for the planned reunion even though it would give her a chance to visit her father Keith Mars (Colantoni). Keith a onetime Neptune sheriff raised Veronica largely by himself Her mother a troubled woman with a drinking problem skipped out on the family after Keith was run off the job for being principled. At that point Veronica who used to be part of the towns in crowd was demoted to loser status but that demotion also led her to develop surprisingly sophisticated investigative skills -- on the series she put those to use in solving the murder of her best friend making her father proud.Veronica wants nothing to do with Neptune now. Shes living with the sweet-natured but (still) clearly not-right-for-her Stosh ""Piz"" Piznowski (Chris Lowell) who has been in love with her since the two were teenagers. And shes seemingly forgotten her volatile and complex on-again off-again ex-boyfriend Logan (Jason Dohring). The key word is ""seemingly"" When Veronica learns that Logan is a suspect in the death of his rock-star girlfriend (shes been electrocuted in the bathtub) she senses something isnt right and books a plane ticket home.Film Details Veronica Mars RatingPG-13 GenreComedy Running Time68 More Info Trailer The elaborate plotting isnt the films strongest feature. I suspect that anyone unfamiliar with the show might get tangled up in the threads that Thomas and his co-writer Diane Ruggiero spin out. But as with all great TV shows on Veronica Mars the really interesting things were all happening in the margins and here Thomas Ruggiero and the cast make the most of every available corner. Logan is now in the military a pretty wild choice for a spoiled rich kid. But thank God Thomas understands the distinction between whats believable and whats realistic. In movie terms Logans choice is wholly believable especially when we see him in uniform. He meets Veronica at the airport in his dress whites and though she cant resist making an Officer and a Gentleman wisecrack (who could?) hes so tall and solemn and quietly lovestruck that we can see her going weak at the knees. She blurts out what were thinking ""You should only ever wear that like ever.""On the show Logan was the sort of character who was hateful at the beginning and irresistibly beguiling by the end. Dohring still has that boyish vaguely bratty look though now its laced with gravity. But its the reunion between Colantoni and Bell that proves the movies most gratifying element. The Keith-Veronica dynamic was one of the great father-daughter relationships of modern storytelling a sturdy meshwork of mutual protectiveness respect and affection. Bell and Colantoni easily pick up where they left off in 2007. Bell has always been a sly sparkling presence though she hasnt had the movie career she deserves at least until recently. (Shes the voice of Anna in the Disney hit Frozen.)Seven years after the demise of the show Bell is more grown-up and definitely curvier -- shes like a real person only better looking -- and her timing is more playful and precise than ever. Colantoni who may be best remembered by movie audiences as Thermian leader Mathesar in the superb sci-fi spoof Galaxy Quest is an extraordinarily subtle actor which may be why he made such a good TV dad for Veronica. His bald pate gave his eyebrows lots of room to roam and they needed it considering the trouble she kept getting herself into. But he was always as amused by his daughter as he was frustrated by her sometimes misguided independence and he was never overbearing or sentimental in his love for her. The nuances of their relationship carry over into this new iteration of Veronica Mars. If youve never seen the show its a great excuse for binge-watching. And if you loved the show the movie is a welcome homecoming. It has the feeling of a story that has been against all odds loved into existence. Probably because thats exactly what it is.

"Review Veronica Mars worth the long wait for fans - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Veronica Mars worth the long wait for fansBy Chuck Barney cbarneybayareanewsgroup.comContra Costa TimesPosted 03/11/2014 102717 AM PDTUpdated 03/12/2014 044451 PM PDT Click photo to enlarge This image released by Warner Bros. Pictures shows Ryan Hansen left and Kristen Bell in a scene from ""Veronica Mars."" (AP Photo/Warner Bros. Pictures Robert Voets) <<123>>Passionate TV fans are like puppies with a chew toy They sink their teeth -- and hearts -- into their favorite shows and just refuse to let go.In the case of ""Veronica Mars"" an offbeat gem of a series starring Kristen Bell as a whip-smart teen detective the fans -- or ""Marshmallows"" as they are known -- put their money where their mouth is. By funding a historic 5.7 million Kickstarter campaign theyve given the show a miraculous big-screen resurrection seven years after it was killed off.Their investment has been rewarded with a brisk and sweetly satisfying if predictable film that gets the band back together again and pretty much hits all the beats you expect it to hit.It opens with an introductory recap montage that works to bring everyone including newbies up to speed. Veronica a champion of high school misfits details how she began her sleuthing ways as a 15-year-old trying to figure out who murdered her best friend Lilly Kane. It was a way of coping with her personal pain while growing up in Neptune a seaside town rife with class wars.Cut to New York City where Veronica now a hotshot Stanford grad is poised to take a job with a high-powered law firm. Shes also joined at the hip with her nerdy college sweetheart Stosh ""Piz"" Piznarski (Chris Lowell). Neptune? Its but a speck in her rearview mirror and not even an impending 10-year high school reunion is enough of a pull. She wants no reminders of the old ""angry vengeful me.""Advertisement But like the shows obsessive devotees Veronica cant really move on. She gets a call from Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) her former hot-tempered nemesis and onetime flame who has been accused of killing his rock-star girlfriend. So off to Neptune she goes with a promise to be back soon. Yeah right.The crime and the reunion are convenient excuses for creator Rob Thomas and writing partner Diane Ruggiero to send out the call to members of their talented cast. And it truly does feel like were connecting with old BFFs as Veronica catches up with Wallace (Percy Daggs III) Mac (Tina Majorino) Weevil (Francis Capra) and several others. Good vibes abound.But the reunion to savor the most is between Veronica and her sheriff-turned-private-eye dad Keith (Enrico Colantoni). Their seemingly effortless on-screen chemistry produced one of TVs most endearing father-daughter relationships and its a joy to see them back together exchanging warm glances and sarcastic barbs while also butting heads. Together they provide some of the films best moments.As for the central mystery its not exactly mind-blowing in its complexity. But whodunit cases have never been the main point with ""Veronica Mars"" which is more interested in examining social injustice and class division through the eyes of a strong self-confident young woman. Fortunately Bell as charming and witty as ever smoothly steps back into the role she was born to play. Even with the Kickstarter cash Thomas had to pinch pennies so ""Veronica Mars"" isnt artificially amped up with special effects or exotic locales like many TV-to-big-screen projects. Instead Thomas goes out of his way to please the shows fandom in other ways cramming the story with in-jokes slick visuals and lots of really fun cameos that we wont spoil here. On occasion it feels like pandering especially when the film awkwardly addresses lingering feelings between Veronica and Logan a plot line the so-called ""shippers"" were always hung up on.Then again why not give the fans what they want -- and paid for? The film winds up in a place suggesting we could see more of ""Veronica Mars"" in the future.

Photo Robert Voets/Warner Bros. MOVIE REVIEW Veronica Mars Running time 108 minutes. Rated PG-13 (violence profanity sexuality). At the Empire Kips Bay others. Basically TV writ large ""Veronica Mars is far less interesting (except probably to its fans) to me as movie than as a potential model for financing the kind of smaller films that major Hollywood studios arent much interested in making anymore. Star Kristen Bell and creator-director Rob Thomas famously raised a record 5.7 million from 91585 backers for this Kickstarter-funded follow-up to their ratings-challenged TV series about a wisecracking teenage private investigator which ran from 2004 to 2007 on UPN and the CW and has developed a devoted cult following. ""Veronica Mars"" is also making history as the first major studio film thats simultaneously being released on the big screen -- Warner Bros. is opening it in 270 theaters nationally -- and via video-on-demand. This movie takes great pains to thank the fans who made this possible by including many characters from the series -- a good deal for them not necessarily so great for the rest of us. Those unfamiliar with the source material (theres a summary at the beginning of the film) are left with a mystery that looks a lot like a two-part TV episode -- not really bad but less engaging or surprising than your typical episode of ""Murder She Wrote."" As the film opens its nine years after the series final season had Veronica in her freshman year at college and the brainy former high school rebel has put those days far behind her -- or at least she thinks so. Kristen Bell brings ""Veronica"" to the big screen.Photo Robert Voets/Warner Bros. In New York shes waiting for the final word about a job as a corporate lawyer at a Manhattan firm and is engaged to one of her more stable classmates (Chris Lowell). But all it takes is a call for help to send her flying back home to Neptune Calif. where her hotheaded ex-boyfriend Logan (Jason Dohring) is a suspect in the death of another classmate -- self-destructive pop-star Carrie (Andrea Estella) -- who is found electrocuted in her bathtub with Logan passed out nearby. Veronicas ex wants her to help him find a lawyer but soon enough shes back sleuthing with the help of pals Mac (Tina Majorino) and Wallace (Percy Daggs III). Is the actual culprit a fan (a very funny Gaby Hoffman) of the dead woman with a thing for Logan? Or does it have something to do with a long-ago tragedy involving rich bitch Gia (Krysten Ritter) and moronic surfer Dick (Ryan Hansen)? And is the corrupt new sheriff (Jerry OConnell) trying to cover something up? Veronicas visit coincides with her 10-year high school reunion which facilitates cameo appearances and ups the number of potential red herrings but doesnt really do much for suspense. Bell gives her all to a paper-thin script but cant generate much chemistry with either of her love interests. The best parts of this awkwardly paced film are Bells scenes with Enrico Colantoni who returns as her private investigator dad concerned shes throwing away a bright future by getting sucked back into her old life. The worst part is cameos by James Franco and TMZs Harvey Levin featured in a subplot about surreptitious celebrity surveillance thats a lot less fresh and shocking than the filmmakers seem to think it is. Fans can certainly feel free to add a star to my rating of ""Veronica Mars. Hopefully the next crowd-sourced major studio film will be a little more ambitious.

Daily Edition Login to download Veronica Mars SXSW Review 1201 AM PST 3/9/2014 by Sheri Linden FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS A solid cinematic turn for the Nancy Drew of the new millennium sure to delight crowdfunding backers and other fans of the source series. TWITTER Having triumphed on Kickstarter Rob Thomas and Kristen Bell give their tough-girl-detective TV drama second life as a standalone feature. Canceled by the CW in 2007 the cult-fave mystery series Veronica Mars completed its third season with an (open-ended) episode titled ""The Bitch Is Back."" Revived for the big screen the gumshoe drama finds its title character nine years later insisting that shes in a mellower frame of mind no longer the angry crime-solving kickass who thrills to danger. As if. After a murder hits close to home the law-school grad tosses aside her sleek job-interview threads and is soon sleuthing it up among the rich famous corrupt and depraved who populate her SoCal hometown. Kristen Bell is in fine form as the sharp-witted and stiletto-tongued Veronica whose high polish on the art of sarcasm has endeared her to fans as a supremely self-possessed outsider. VIDEO Watch the First Two Minutes of the Veronica Mars Movie Opening a year after series creator Rob Thomas and star Bell launched their record-breaking Kickstarter campaign raising 5.7 million Veronica Mars the movie will pull in solid business -- and repeat business -- among enthusiasts who have endured a long wait to see the residents of fictional Neptune Calif. once again. Intense publicity over the grassroots financing has likely stirred up a certain curiosity factor among those who have never seen the show. The question remains whether a crowdfunding phenomenon involving a relatively small but avid fan base translates into box-office gold for Warners. The studio has opted for a somewhat cautious 270-screen launch and day-and-date VOD release after the movies premiere at SXSW. As with the TV show the connect-the-dots mystery solving is less interesting than the character dynamics; crimes unravel with a directness that feels aimed at younger audiences. The dark doings are leavened and sometimes undercut by comedy and by angst thats not far removed from adolescence. Thomas sex drugs and rock n roll neo-noir has a young-adult heart that still beats strong even with Veronica and her friends well into their twenties. The 10-year reunion of Neptune High just happens to be impending when Veronica returns home to help solve a murder and teen allegiances animosities and romances loom large in the film which features many actors reprising their small-screen roles. STORY Veronica Mars Kickstarter Backers Start Cashing in on 5.7 Million Pledge Thomas and co-scripter Diane Ruggiero provide a concise recap of the series trajectory in the form of a stylized montage with voiceover narration that will bring even newbies up to speed on the central character. Cut to Manhattan where the sight of Veronica in the glass-walled conference room of a prestigious Manhattan law firm interviewing for a job is bound to disappoint aficionados who are used to seeing her speak truth to power not cozy up to it. The crime that brings her back to beach town Neptune is the apparent murder of pop star Bonnie DeVille (Andrea Estella) a high school classmate and girlfriend of Veronicas former flame Logan (Jason Dohring) himself a demi-celebrity because hes the son of an actor. Hes suspect No. 1 and Veronica doesnt hesitate to drop everything to help him leaving behind a potential new job in New York and supportive boyfriend Piz (Chris Lowell). The Piz-Logan dilemma -- good guy vs. bad boy straightforward vs. complicated -- is a fundamental element of the movie in a way that starts out YA and turns believably grown-up messy. As she digs into the case Veronica reconnects with close friends Mac (Tina Majorino) and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) trades barbs with surfer jerk Dick (Ryan Hansen) and circumvents the dishonest obstructionist sheriff (Jerry OConnell). In the process she crosses paths with a wacko fan of the dead pop singer (Gaby Hoffmann) and uncovers a very cold 9-year-old case that involves a collective silence among her former classmates. STORY Veronica Mars Movie Pools Pressure With Opportunity for Rob Thomas The screenplay doesnt avoid bouts of where-are-they-now exposition as it draws connective lines between high school and adulthood. But at its strongest as in Veronicas relationship with her sheriff-turned-private-investigator father (Enrico Colantoni) theres no need to spell things out. Colantoni is understated and terrific as a man who has weathered serious challenges and reversals. The father-daughter chemistry between him and Bell is an essential component of the movie as of the series -- loaded with emotion but never lapsing into sentimentality. As a middle-class girl in a rich kids town Bell imbues Veronica with gutsiness and vulnerability. Her refusal to be trivialized by the wide assortment of creeps and phonies who make the mistake of crossing her is a particularly admirable quality. Even so Thomas direction especially of the villainous roles gives a lot of the action a self-conscious not-quite-real quality. Some aspects of the movies intentional artifice work better than others. On the plus side are the visuals. Cinematographer Ben Kutchins widescreen lensing adopts the heightened lighting scheme of the show accentuating the vintage-meets-contemporary temperament of production designer Jeff Schoens interiors. PHOTOS 17 TV Shows Brought Back From the Dead Thomas and Ruggiero use Neptunes proximity to Hollywood to good effect throwing in showbiz references (awards-show gift bags play a crucial if far-fetched role in the mystery) along with pop culture nods. Showing up for cameos as themselves are Harvey Levin a peeved-looking Ira Glass and most inventively an uncredited and very funny James Franco. Amid the winking a dark thread runs through the movie that has no direct bearing on the crimes Veronica is trying to solve. She makes repeated references to her absent alcoholic mother and most jarringly to addiction in general. Its a thread that doesnt feel fully integrated into the film but suggests material that Thomas might explore if he decides to make a second Veronica Mars feature.

Watch video Veronica Mars Trailer Kristen Bell Gets Pulled Back to Neptune (Video) But dont worry ""Veronica"" vets theres plenty for you too there are references to ""marshmallows"" and Kickstarter (the crowd-sourcing site by which super-fans helped this movie get made) in the first ten minutes. As the film gets underway Veronica is living in New York as a recent law school graduate interviewing for a job with a tony high-powered firm. She tells us in the narration that snooping and stalking is something in her past and she wants to leave her old gumshoe-ing behind for a life as an attorney with her fiance Piz (Chris Lowell) whose gig at NPR enables the first of several amusing celebrity cameos. Thomas and Ruggieros script treat Veronicas sleuthing as an addiction and the first taste of the forbidden stuff comes when she goes back to Neptune to help out her ex-boyfriend Logan (Jason Dohring) whos been accused of murdering their high school classmate Carrie (Andrea Estella) a famous pop star. Even though it means being in town for Veronicas tenth high-school reunion -- which brings her back together with pals Mac (Tina Majorino) and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) -- Veronica keeps postponing her return to Manhattan as she gets more deeply engrossed with who really killed Carrie especially when it appears to have something to do with an incident from their high school days. Was the assailant super-fan Ruby Jetson (Gaby Hoffman hilariously batty here)? Rich snob Gia (Krysten Ritter)? Corrupt sheriff Dan Lamb (Jerry OConnell)? Idiot surfer Dick (Ryan Hansen ""Party Down"")? Or any number of other suspicious Neptune-ites? The mystery consumes Veronica no matter what the damage its doing to her personal and career prospects back east. Also read Veronica Mars Movie Available On-Demand Same Day as Theatrical Release I realize Im late on this not having seen the show but Bell is flat-out terrific mixing spunk smarts and sex in a way that brings to mind the leading ladies of Hollywoods golden age. There arent a lot of people working today who merit comparison to the likes of Jean Arthur and Rosalind Russell but Bells working on that level here. The ensemble cast is generally fast and funny zipping through the scripts clever repartee and even ""Mars"" newcomers will find themselves welcome in their company even if we dont always know whos an ally and whos secretly a murderer. Theres one odd bit of casting although saying so might be high treason to the shows fans Bell has lots more screen chemistry with Lowell than she does with Dohring and it throws off the balance turning what should be an equilateral love triangle into an isosceles one. Also read Veronica Mars Fan Events Sell Out Fast So AMC Adds More The romance aside however ""Veronica Mars"" makes the jokes witty the mystery challenging and the suspense and action tense. You dont have to have tuned in to the small-screen version to enjoy it on the big one. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Veronica Mars Review If Sleuthing Is Wrong We Dont Want Her to Be Right Rob Thomass much-anticipated movie based on the canceled TV series manages to bring a truly new chapter that marshmallows will eat up By Jethro Nededog The ""Veronica Mars"" movie - hard-earned by the loyalty of its fandom via a Kickstarter campaign - goes a long way to fill the void left behind when The CW canceled it in 2007. When we catch up with Veronica (Kristen Bell) she has done a really good job of leaving the dark world of her gumshoe past behind. Shes a recent law school grad living in New York City and she even picked the ""right"" guy Piz (Chris Lowell). But one call from frenemy/ex-lover Logan (Jason Dohring) -- whos accused of killing his pop star girlfriend Bonnie DeVille aka Carrie (Andrea Estella who replaces Leighton Meester from the series) -- pulls her back to Neptune. Even when she aims to stay just a few days we know theres no way thats true. Also read PaleyFest Moves to Dolby Theatre With American Horror Story Veronica Mars Events Creator Rob Thomas who co-wrote the film with series executive producer Diane Ruggiero uncovers Veronicas deep addiction to making things right. Its not a hard feeling for fans of the series to tap into as its the same addiction we feel when we love a TV show. Whats binge-watching if not a form of addictive behavior? So we can quickly understand how Veronica can find herself knee-deep in Neptunes class war once again. As luck would have it the trip coincides with Veronicas class reunion so the whole gang is back too Mac (Tina Majorino) whos feeling her oats and ready to rub her success and hot makeover into the faces of her old judgmental classmates; Wallace (Percy Daggs III) whos now a basketball coach at Neptune High (ahoy); and Dick (Ryan Hansen) is back unchanged as if it was just yesterday that exploding fist pumps were the thing. Veronica has plenty of quick run-ins with alums who each seem to deliver a quick rundown of their history with the former teen detective. I saw these bits of expository as necessary evils to bring newbies up to speed so I forgave them. Also read 9 Burning Box Office Questions Can Divergent Live Up to the Hype? Will Veronica Mars Validate Crowdfunding? Bell is back in true form. Her physicality her ability to drop the witty turn of phrases and then lend gravity to situations when needed are still spot-on. Enrico Colantoni who plays Veronicas private eye father and Bell still have the great chemistry we remember from the series. Hes looking out for her but also knows that he cant keep her from doing what she wants. Warner Bros. The movie does play off the raging fan war between Veronicas men Logan and Piz. Dohring is still excellent at pulling off dark and unpredictable although Logan is less of a loose cannon after joining the military in the time thats elapsed. And Lowell whose character is being courted by NPR still feels like a puppy you just want to shield from pain. The movie takes a good while setting up the town the crew of new and old characters and the clues that may or may not lead Veronica to clearing Logans name. That story builds to a thrilling pace though and shows that Thomas/Ruggiero have a firm grasp of what makes this chapter worthy of being shown in theaters and not just an extended episode of ""Veronica Mars."" See video TheWrap of Con Grading the Veronica Mars Movie -- And it Looks Good Even better than its central murder story the movie also gets that like Veronica the shows fans have grown up too. Thats new for this franchise. While were not fighting our urge to sleuth we have made decisions that probably contradict who we really are. We can understand how Veronica battles with the ""adult"" thing to do versus the thing that makes her who she really is because weve fought similar battles of our own since ""Veronica Mars"" was on TV. Its called growing up. In Veronicas life that battle represents themselves as Logan versus Piz tell dad the truth or keep him in the dark risk her life or walk away now and stay in Neptune or take that Big City lawyering job. Also read Veronica Mars Creator Envisions A Bond Franchise Its a battle she fights over and over again throughout the movie and its that battle that makes the movie truly a new chapter for fans of the TV series. In this case the ""wrong"" decision can lead to many more ""Veronica Mars"" stories to come so if sleuthing is wrong we dont want Veronica to be right.
