"Pathfinder | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; pathfinder ) Pathfinder (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Pathfinder feels like one of those generic 80s action films where theres plenty of violence with no suspense lots of stunt work but no excitement and a cast of characters so poorly developed that its easier to care about the background scenery. To add insult to injury the movie is filmed in a way that makes it seem like the camera has epilepsy and the color desaturation renders everything murky. Someone should remind director Marcus Nispel that theres a difference between making a music video and a feature film. The premise is borrowed from Tarzan with Native Americans standing in for the apes and the Vikings replacing the English. Ghost (Karl Urban) is a Norwegian child left behind when the Vikings first visit the North American continent some 1100 years ago. He is raised by the locals and becomes a great warrior. Eventually his countrymen return led by Gunnar (Clancy Brown) and bent on ethnic cleansing. Thats where the hacking slashing and chasing begins. Ghost is accompanied by two companions Pathfinder (played by Russell Means who got lost here on his way to The Last of the Mohicans) and his daughter (Moon Bloodgood) a.k.a. The Obligatory Love Interest. Pathfinder which is a remake of the 1987 Norwegian film Veiviseren is barely tolerable during the action sequences even though the camera moves around so much it can be difficult to figure out whats going on. Things become tedious during the films lengthy down times when were subjected to what passes for dialogue being uttered by actors who would impress more if they didnt say anything. Karl Urban for example looks kind of fearsome but speaking ruins the effect. Moon Bloodgood could pass for a Native American (even though shes not) but her utterance of phrases like ""Im not gonna leave you behind"" hurts the image. Then theres the curious situation of the Vikings speaking Norwegian and the Native Americans speaking English. Huh? The thing that makes it tough to enjoy Pathfinder is that theres no character worth caring about. Sure Ghost is supposed to be the protagonist but in the end it will be tough to find anyone whos worried about whether or not hell survive the orgy of bloodletting. The secondary characters are an even bigger joke as far as audience identification is concerned - when one of them is drawn-and-quartered (a particularly nasty form of death) it provokes a shrug. As for the bad guysa| Aside from the fact that theyre all dressed alike in those bulky Viking costumes which makes it impossible to tell one from another the dont inspire much in the way of antipathy. Director Nispel tries to re-enforce how big a badass his chief Viking is by having the guy come back from the dead in true action movie villain fashion but the resurrection will be greeted with a yawn by those who are still awake. The main problem is that for all of its sword fights and chase scenes Pathfinder isnt fun. The story is shallow and uninteresting the stakes are low and the camera work and editing are so overly ""artistic"" that they destroy the coherence of the action sequences. I have heard comparisons made to both Conan the Barbarian and Apocalypto but Pathfinder is so far below those movies in entertainment value that it feels almost criminal to include the titles in this review. Pathfinder wants to provide a jolt of adrenaline; ironically it works better as a tranquilizer. And should you fall asleep and miss the ending dont worry. What happens is pretty much what you expect.

This latest bit of historical balder-dash stands in direct defiance of proven action-movie formulas trusting its brutal concept and striking visuals to overcome a lack of star power. Savage Vikings are outwitted by one of their own in ""Pathfinder"" a visionary chest-thumper set 600 years before Columbus. Boldly reinventing Norways 1988 Oscar nominee ""Ofelas"" musicvid director Marcus Nispel relocates the adventure to primeval America where evidence suggests the European invaders landed but did not last. Like ""300"" and ""Apocalypto"" this latest bit of historical balder-dash stands in direct defiance of proven action-movie formulas trusting its brutal concept and striking visuals to overcome a lack of star power. But without a muscular campaign ""Pathfinder"" will likely draw only a fraction of their biz despite ""Conan""-like appeal to testosterone crowds. Pic rolled out earlier this year in a dozen overseas territories and has grossed almost 10 million to date. Permitting herself considerable creative license screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis imagines what might have stopped Vikings from settling in North America. Story opens at the end of a failed first expedition as a lone Wampanaog Indian woman discovers a frightened young orphan in the belly of a smoldering Norse ""dragon ship."" She takes him home where he is accepted into the tribe. Fifteen years later the invaders return only now the abandoned young man has grown into ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Xena Warrior Princess"" veteran Karl Urban an oddly proportioned action hero whose Hugh Jackman-like facial features sit perched atop a beefcake frame. Urban spends most of the movie wearing little more than a leather loincloth though editors Jay Friedkin and Glen Scantlebury seem to be working overtime cutting around his bulky but sub-Spartan physique. While Urban strains to carry the movie it is the monstrous Vikings who actually prove most compelling. An ominous lot they lumber about in silhouette like the dark Orcs from Ralph Bakshis ""Lord of the Rings"" cartoons while Renee Aprils detailed costumes -- all horns and skulls and metal scales -- evoke the more recent live-action trilogy. The invaders gnarled snorts and guttural Icelandic dialogue strike a fearsome contrast to the mild-tempered English-speaking natives. Something is clearly afoot in Hollywood that projects about ancient Mayan Spartan and Viking showdowns are being developed and released. As a follow-up to Nispels ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" remake ""Pathfinder"" seems like sheer lunacy the equivalent of Zack Snyder remaking Inuit chase movie ""Atanarjuat the Fast Runner."" And yet with a visual sense to rival Ridley Scotts Nispel ensures that every shot tells a story mixing the meticulous landscape aesthetic of Hudson River School painters Thomas Cole and Asher B. Durand with the macabre imagery of contemporary fantasy artists enhanced by the helmers decision to shoot against real British Columbia wilderness. Gone is the spare poetry and arctic mysticism of Gaups original. Instead Nispel trades in dense sophisticated compositions. Reteaming with regular lenser Daniel C. Pearl he stacks every frame with layers of movement and texture from extreme foreground to deep distant background. Yet the pic has difficulty carrying a thought from one shot to the next. Individual shots pack a strong emotional punch but entire scenes -- such as a high-speed sled chase -- unfold with numb disorienting confusion. In general the pic handles action well. Whether fending off bear attacks or a full-blown avalanche Ghost (as Urbans character is called) twirls his sword and attacks in the well-choreographed style of a true matinee idol. But Nispel proves clumsy with actors relying more on blocking than the nuances of actual performance. Characters are exaggerated cartoons hardly human at all. ""Pathfinders"" Vikings are certainly evil enough but they are largely faceless and interchangeable with no one personality more despicable than the others. To evoke the desired feelings the pic instead relies on cues from the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus -- half bone-rattling marches half martyr-minded arias.

"Pathfinder Gives up the Ghost | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesPathfinder Gives up the GhostAs dim and dank as a power failure in a peepshow P athfinder is Apocalypto without the laughs or 300 without the muscular visuals and elevating dialogue.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. April 13 2007  (out of 4)Starring Karl Urban Moon Bloodgood and Russell Means. Directed by Marcus Nispel. 99 minutes. At major theatres. 18A  Article Continued BelowAs dim and dank as a power failure in a peepshow Pathfinder is Apocalypto without the laughs or 300 without the muscular visuals and elevating dialogue.That doesnt add up to a recommendation but dont seek clarity here. The films heroic orphan Ghost played by Karl Urban with nostril-flaring intensity is every bit as muddled as the images on the screen.Should he remain loyal to the Viking barbarians who spawned him and who taunted and whipped him because he was too much the peacenik to lop off heads?Or should he hang with the adoptive Native Americans who saved his life and raised him to be strong sensitive and respectful of nature?The choice may seem obvious but the ""Who am I?"" question persists for Ghost long into the movie and well past the average attention span. Indeed the title Pathfinder seems more mocking than illuminating.Pity the person who will one day see this on a cell phone or iPod. Even blown up to theatre size its like watching a movie underwater.Set in a blustery America 500 years before Columbus dropped anchor it also distorts history. Norways Vikings are presented as foreign conquerors who seek only to bust heads and gather slaves. Norway should sue.The murky look of the picture directed by Marcus Nispel (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) from the graphic novel that partly inspired it is at least consistent with the narrative confusion.Urbans Ghost named for his white skin and blond hair was born the son of a Viking leader a ferocious Darth Vader type who really suits the rams horns headdress favoured by his fellow warriors. Ghost severely disappoints his dad by failing to sever heads with appropriate gusto. When a shipwreck leaves Ghost as the sole survivor of his murderous crew hes adopted by the local Wampanoag Indians who raise him as one of their own despite doubts about his loyalty. Hes taught to hunt and fight yet denied the status of a full-blooded warrior. What if the Vikings return - as you know they will - and Ghost turns on his adoptive people?To muddy the waters even further motivation becomes an issue. Should Ghost resist genocidal invaders because theyre lopping off the heads of the locals and torching their villages or because he seeks vengeance for past crimes?Such distinctions really matter to the Pathfinder (Russell Means) a tribal elder who would apparently rather see a massacre than deal with any guilt about killing in self-defence. Yet how can Ghost stop the Vikings and win the heart of his lady love (Moon Bloodgood) without firing at least a few arrows in anger?The answer is that he cant of course and having to play both hero and tortured soul leaves our loincloth-clad lad in perpetual doubt - which is not where you want to be when Vikings are swinging swords in your direction.By the time Ghost has finally figured it out audience members may have long since found their own path directly out of the theatre.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Directed by Marcus Nispel from a screenplay by Laeta Kalogridis. 100 minutes. Rated R for strong brutal violence throughout. Several theaters. By any rational criteria ""Pathfinder"" barely qualifies as a movie. It takes 100 minutes to tell less story than youd find in most TV commercials and tells it with such dour solemnity and lack of coherent purpose that its hard to imagine its screenplay was ever written. But it was -- by one of the writers of Oliver Stones ""Alexander"" so consider yourself warned. Unlike Stones film no amount of editorial tinkering could ever fix ""Pathfinder."" Loosely inspired by the Oscar-nominated 1987 Norwegian film of the same name this crushing bore begins by telling us (as legend would have it) that Vikings discovered North America 600 years before Columbus. One of their longboats was destroyed and the sole survivor was a boy adopted by a northeastern Native American tribe renamed ""Ghost"" and raised as one of their own. Years later Ghost is now a buff brave-in-the-making (played by New Zealand actor Karl Urban) mentored by chief Pathfinder (Russell Means) and smitten with a tribal hottie named Starfire (Moon Bloodgood). Thats when the Vikings return led by character actor Clancy Brown under thick furs and armor spouting subtitled Norse dialect and eager for destruction. Ghost defends his tribe and the ensuing Viking-against-Viking smackdown consists of seemingly endless low-budget battle scenes so badly edited that you cant tell (and dont care) whos beheading whom. Drained of all color and set against near-constant snowfall ""Pathfinder"" runs its murky course with cheap-looking CGI dreary locations (filmed in Vancouver B.C.) and a climactic sequence on a treacherous mountain ledge that was done far better in ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" Best known for his 2003 remake of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" Marcus Nispel directs this waste of time as if he were anesthetized and that numbness extends to the performances for which ""wooden"" is a generous assessment. Compared to the dynamic ""Apocalypto"" there is simply nothing in this film to hold anyones interest. Fan-boys and Fangoria readers are this movies target audience and theyll be the most disappointed. The official ""Pathfinder"" Web site is far more interesting than the movie itself and youll get better history lessons from the Vikings of Minnesota.

He has a sword. 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Pathfinder Action adventure. Starring Karl Urban Moon Bloodgood and Russell Means. Directed by Marcus Nispel. (R. 99 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Pathfinder"" begins with a long wordless sequence in which an American Indian woman circa A.D. 900 stumbles upon a lot of dead Vikings. After rummaging around a bog for a bit and screaming when a dead body surfaces with a spider crawling out of its mouth the woman finds a live Viking boy all alone. She takes him back to the village. Fortunately she lets him keep his sword as it comes in handy years later. [Podcast ""Pathfinder"" loses its way; Halle Berry gorgeous in ""Perfect Stranger""] No more than a minute into this and it becomes obvious that the next 98 are going to be trouble. The introduction which seems to take forever clues viewers in on (1) The movie is going to be violent; (2) The movie is going to be gruesome; (3) The movie is going to be slow; and worst of all (4) Somebodys taking this thing seriously. Somebody is taking something destined from concept to script to be on the level of ""Alien vs. Predator"" and trying to turn it into -- brace yourself -- art. Oh no. Oh. No. At heart ""The Pathfinder"" is really nothing but an excuse for slaughter. The Vikings who look like giants and are covered from head to toe in animal skins return to the New World 15 years later intent on wiping out the native peoples. They get off to a strong start but in the process they manage to anger Ghost (Karl Urban) the Viking boy (now a man) who has been raised by the Indians. He picks up his sword and sets about to do what Rambo did in ""Rambo III"" -- to wipe out an army single-handedly. Such a film was bound to be monotonous but director Marcus Nispel adds artistic touches that make ""Pathfinder"" downright painful to sit through. Everything is in the dark set mainly either in the woods by moonlight or inside caves and the cinematography is such that the film almost looks as though its shot in black and white. Only the skin tone jumps out with any color. Like a romantic comedy in which you know the principals have to get together ""Pathfinder"" has no suspense. Obviously Ghost is going to kill every Viking on the American continent and the only open question neither a point of interest nor concern is whether he will survive the process. Thus because we know what will happen the trick of the movie is to make the ""how"" of it interesting. But Nispel doesnt really try to do that. Instead he tries to convince us that were seeing something important. And so instead of interesting characters or imaginatively crafted scenes we get thundering drums in an echo chamber the distant sound of a galloping horse the cry of a raven piercing the night and ... zzzzzzzz ... zzzzzzz ... Where am I? Let me splash my face with water and Ill get right back to you. This isnt just bad its boring and its difficult to imagine whod enjoy this One guy gets stabbed (""Ahhhh"") another gets slashed (""Ahhhh"") and another gets his throat cut (""Glub glub""). Times that by about 20 at least. Moon Bloodgood as the heros girlfriend gets beaten up by barbarians every five minutes until the spectacle passes through sad and then repetitious and lands in the ridiculous. Actually that might make a good drinking game Take a shot of tequila every time a barbarian strikes the heros girlfriend. You wont make it through ""Pathfinder"" but thats the idea. -- Advisory Nonstop carnage.

Don Imus this is your life. The movie takes us on a journey to an ugly contentious period in our misty ancient past - all the way back to four months ago when ""Apocalypto"" came out. Somewhere in the Americas centuries before Columbus a Viking man who was raised by friendly Indians (they tootle on flutes and nibble corn chips) finds his adopted tribe wiped out by invading Norsemen who look like a cross between Oakland Raiders fans and the Knights Who Say ""Ni."" Quivering with revenge the hero (Karl Urban) who is known as ""Ghost"" either because of his pale skin or because hes as bad an actor as Patrick Swayze goes on the run and resolves to massacre every Viking he can find. The Vikings do the same to the Indians. The scorecard reads slaughter slaughter slaughter chase guy getting an eyeball stitched together ""I want to kill them all"" ""Hes bleeding"" ""We will stand and fight"" Grizzly attack chase slaughter chase slaughter guy getting his four limbs tied to four horses that pull him apart like a grilled cheese sandwich. When the Vikings finally capture Ghost they forget that theyve just spent the last 45 minutes in a killing orgy shouting ""Bring me his head"" Now they decide to keep him alive because . . . he knows where theres a pot of gold? Because they fear he has supernatural powers? No. Because they want someone to lead them to the next village. And theyre OK with giving the job to the guy who has made a habit of springing out of the shrubbery to run his sword through their necks. While hes leading them on of course hes leading them on devising a plan for murdering every Viking from here to Fran Tarkenton. Onward we trudge through a mystery landscape where its steaming jungles in one scene biting blizzards and snow-covered hills in the next. Worried that Ghost is taking all of the butchering personally his girlfriend (Moon Bloodgood) advises him not to lose his temper while hes cutting off heads ""There are two wolves fighting in every mans heart. One is love."" Long pause. Dramatic tension building. Viewers ransack their brains searching for an answer to the puzzle. Whatever could come next? ""The other is hate."" Oh. OK. Put me down for the latter thanks. Topics DVD Movies | 4 Comments >> 4 Responses to ""Review ""Pathfinder"""" TLSBIRD Says September 10th 2007 at 636 pm you got it all wrong this movie has everything in it that a fan could want. its got passion good acting and an actual story line of life and honor not that you know about these things. it holds a story told years ago but makes us take a look at life now and realize what problems face us are somewhat like the ones before. this movie was excellent and karl did a much better job in the lead role than that guy from 300. pete Says November 3rd 2007 at 939 pm He got it right I just watched the film its muck a complete waste of time and money Orlando Says December 3rd 2007 at 615 pm What a load of old cock that movie was. Did you know (I just read on Wikipedia) that it is based on an old Oscar Sami film except guess what theres no strong-women type in it. What was all that shite at the end about leading her people? Review is spot on. Watched 300 on Friday now thats a movie. Katherine Says July 25th 2009 at 948 pm I just have to say that your critique of Pathfinder has to be the single greatest movie review I have ever read. I ended up reading it aloud to several friends and members of my family and each time without fail I devolved into tearful snorting laughter each time I got to the description of the films pace and grilled cheese sandwich-like dismemberment. In the interest of full disclosure I havent seen the movie and was looking up reviews on Rotten Tomatoes to see if it would be a worthwhile investment of my time and movie rental money so my appreciation of your review is based solely on its literary content not necessarily its appraisal of the films...well merits.

BY Robert Dominguezdaily News Feature Writer Friday April 13 2007 400 AM ""Pathfinder"" Action-adventure about a young Viking who defends his adoptive Native American tribe against marauding Norsemen. With Karl Urban Russell Means Moon Bloodgood.  Director Marcus Nispel (140). R Violence. At area theaters. If the Spartans-vs.-Persians carnage of ""300"" isnt enough audiences thirsty for more bloodletting can satisfy their urges with ""Pathfinder"" a gory revenge thriller splattered with furious battle scenes. Set centuries before Christopher Columbus discovered the Americas ""Pathfinder"" features an interesting and original premise for an action movie. What would have happened if Vikings - who some historians believe sailed across the Atlantic at least 500 years before Columbus - actually had landed on North American shores? Theyd have raped and pillaged and slaughtered innocent Native Americans at least according to ""Pathfinder"" which stars Brad Pitt look-alike Karl Urban as Ghost a troubled young man with identity issues. Ghost is a Viking but he was adopted by a Native American tribe as a little boy after being separated from his clan. Though he doesnt fit in with most of the people in the Indian tribe having Viking blood will come in handy when he grows up and a small army of marauding Norsemen massacre half the village including his adoptive parents. Though the surviving Indians only have spears and arrows with which to defend themselves Ghost is a natural-born swordsman like his Viking brethren - a skill hell come to use repeatedly. Like an early-day Rambo Ghost singlehandedly decimates the Viking horde by slicing dicing and hacking them to bits. Except when hes not outsmarting them by making them walk on a frozen lake or tumble off a cliff. The Vikings are only a little smarter than their horses but they sure look the part of bloodthirsty villains even if it is more ""Mad Max"" than the Vikings we remember from history books. Between the often murky action sequences is a thin story line about Ghost fulfilling his destiny and finding inner peace. Which is really just an excuse to stage the brutal fight scenes. After the first 1000 or so beheadings impalements and severed limbs ""Pathfinders"" slash may just induce sleep. rdomingueznydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Emerging from an underwater hideout Ghost (Karl Urban) shocks a Viking warrior. Photo Fox Pathfinder 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Pathfinder is a reminder that much American history is written in blood. But this films history owes more to legend than reality and bloodletting is all that concerns it. A tale of American Indian tribes fighting Viking invaders 600 years before Columbus ""discovered"" America Pathfinder takes a Tarzan tack by having a Norse boy abandoned on our shores and raised by such a tribe. Naturally he goes native and when Vikings land again 15 years later the boy grown to manhood (and played by The Lord of the Rings Karl Urban) defends his adopted home. Yet Ghost as hes called for his pale skin is an outcast merely tolerated by the tribe. The only thing that makes him valuable is his skill in wielding the sword left behind with him. Its never explained how he became a master swordsman since his boyhood character is a pacifist. No matter -- theres Viking butt to kick and hes the great white hope. The problem is Ghosts status is so low that he must work alone picking off many mighty Norsemen whose hulking armor and horned helmets have a corny showiness befitting pro wrestlers. And when tribe members take unilateral action many fall into a stake-covered pit Ghost built to get the bad guys. What we have here is a failure to communicate. Thats because dialogue is a low priority in the film which has less plot than most video games. This isnt an atmospheric and thoughtful New World. Its a mindless action orgy filled with smiting rending and senseless savagery. The carnage is so relentless you may start nodding off. Nor does it help that fidgety edits and too-tight closeups make some scenes visually incoherent. Accenting Pathfinders joylessness is washed-out color in which the only hue is a muted blue. True theres stark natural beauty given the wintry settings. But when did towering mountains appear on North Americas northeastern coast? (This was shot near Vancouver on the continents other side.) As a small favor even red blood is muted during the unnatural bloodlust and horror-show gore. Speaking of which just what was the Vikings grudge? History shows them to be adventurers. In this film theyre merely murderers. bruce.westbrookchron.com Todays Deals Columbia Mens Palmerston Peak Water Shorts for 15 + free...

A Norwegian film from 1987 ""Ofelas (Pathfinder)"" won the foreign Academy Award and western producers immediately bought the rights to a remake. Amped with those drums and enough fake blood to float a Scandinavian war fleet the American version of ""Pathfinder"" tapped young director Marcus Nispel who had remade ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" Some mixed pedigree eh? What we get is a Norsk-tinged ""Apocalypto."" Star Karl Urban spends most of his time running through the woods or sneaking through caves with the brutish Vikings sniffing at his moccasin-clad heels. The legend is this Long before Columbus or other Europeans landed in North America Viking ships touched the northeastern shore of the U.S. and Canada. One group of invaders left behind a young boy who was adopted by local Wampanoag Indians and raised as their own. ""You were born to the Dragon Men but you are ours"" Urban is told when he grows up and questions his heritage. Such is the sophistication of dialogue here leading to observations like ""Your daughter has become a woman Pathfinder"" Ugh. Meanwhile those Vikings return intent on wiping out all the Indian villages and starting their own settlement. Urban must lead the fight against his better-armed Viking fathers. The relentless soundtrack and predictable plot might be easier to take if ""Pathfinder"" wasnt so ugly. Its shot with a grainy gray palette turning the majestic locations in British Columbia into a depressing mass of black forest and slushy snow banks. The action has a few dramatic moments and a lot of old Western cliches The arrow-in-the-shoulder bit the low-hanging branches during the chase bit the sliding on a shield down a glacier bit. Go on without me No seriously. Next time go on without me. Heres hoping ""Pathfinder II"" is a straight-to-video- game release.

"Bombastic action rescues monotonous Pathfinder - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Bombastic action rescues monotonous Pathfinder By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  April 13 2007 ""Pathfinder "" is not a movie about the best - selling SUV. It does however serve up another helping of ancient carnage. The movie is part ""Apocalypto "" (warriors threat of hostile takeover violence) and part ""300 "" (warriors threat of hostile takeover violence) but with the commercial misfortune of being neither. Like ""Apocalypto"" its a monotonously single-minded chase picture. Yet like ""300"" its best when bombastic.The story dabbles in fiction (the film calls it ""legend"") settling us in North America ""500 years before Columbus will reach its shores"" and among the Wampanoag Indians who called what is now New England home. They take in a blond Viking orphan discovered lost in the ruins of a massive Norse longship . They name him Ghost  presumably since Tarzan  Annie  and Dances With Wolves were taken. Young Ghost grows into Karl Urban  the New Zealand action star with the kind eyes. When Vikings lay waste to his family he flees into the vast wilderness where another group takes him in and dresses his wounds.But the Germanic-sounding Norsemen -- large hairy interchangeable boors two of whom are allegedly played by Clancy Brown and German he-man Ralf Moeller -- are on Ghosts trail. And he doesnt want harm to visit his new caretakers so he strikes out on his own only to be followed by Starfire (Moon Bloodgood ) the strong but smitten daughter of the tribes wise leader Pathfinder (Russell Means ). Calling the movie ""Ghost"" would just have been too confusing. Plus the old man is beside the point --all the Indians are really.""Pathfinder"" is only interesting to the filmmakers and sadly to us when the hairy dudes stalk Ghost capture him and Starfire  then force him to lead them all back to the protectors he just left. What the movie lacks in developed Indian characters anthropological rigor and dialogue it makes up for in grueling action sequences. One is set on a frozen lake the other on a mountainside cliff. Only then does the German director Marcus Nispel  a veteran of music videos and the man behind 2003s ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre "" remake really seem up for doing any filmmaking. He and his crew choreograph some excitement. But those are two set pieces in a 99-minute adventure that feels longer than that.Urban and Bloodgood make the most of their parts locking eyes and arms and occasionally using American English as if the snowy 10th century were another way of saying ""Where the apres ski?"" Urban is especially well suited for movies like ""Pathfinder"" barely speaking barely clothed. If theres any justice someone will keep him in mind for ""300 II.""Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/movies/blog.

"Pathfinder Another Bloody Iron Age Smackdown washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Pathfinder Another Bloody Iron Age Smackdown Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 13 2007 The smartest thing about ""Pathfinder"" was the decision by an unnamed marketing genius to delay its release date until after ""300"" had fought the battle of Thermopylae (which it lost) and the battle of the box office (which it won). ""Pathfinder"" is a natural destination for those whose spears have been dipped in blood and still want more stylized Iron Age carnage. The contestants this time are not Spartans and Persian Immortals but two other equally noted warrior elites Vikings and Indians. In fact the movie might be considered a niche of a niche It fits into the overall sword-and-sandals rubric but its more tightly focused. Its a sword-and-moccasin epic. The time is roughly 500 years before the arrival of Columbus to what would become North American shores. The setting is therefore the de rigueur idealization of pre-Columbian America as some kind of paradise where willowy maidens and fierce lithe swift warriors nestle by the shores of Gitche Gumee in original innocence. No squalor or poverty or violence or evil can be detected among these chosen people who speak in poetic platitudes and wear designer buckskins. Enter the Dragon people in their long ships with their iron swords and arrowheads their forged spears and their unquenchable zeal for slaughter pillage rape and also littering. Technologically superior and unable to see the land as anything but fodder for plunder they begin to misbehave in annoying ways watching with delight as the flint arrows bounce off their metal breastplates and their heavy blades cleave through rawhide shields. Ho ho ho they laugh confident of their destiny. Memo to oppressors In movies its always a bad idea to go ""ho-ho-ho"" when youre grinding the natives under your sandal soles. The back story This is the second Viking incursion. Twenty years earlier the horn-wearers had their fun practicing genocide but they left behind a Viking boy and a sword. Now called Ghost (and played by the New Zealand-born Karl Urban of ""Lord of the Rings"" renown) he is of the Native Americans but he is not Native American Hes just as much full-toot bull-goose berserker Viking stock as the boys he now must fight. And now theyve got him annoyed. Cutting off a guys mothers head tends to get his attention. Did I tell you Almost no dialogue. Or did you already guess that? The director is Marcus Nispel who achieved 15 minutes of fame a few years back with a stylish remake of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" so he knows his way around an exploding splatter-pack of mock blood. The inspiration is the original Norwegian ""Pathfinder"" of 1987 a hard-to-find (and I have not found it) cult item which was equally Iron Age but where the antagonists were the savage Tjuder on the track of Lapps. There was no ""lost son"" subplot in the original Im betting nor any cross-racial overtones. And these are what is disturbing about the film. The record shows that Native Americans were extremely adaptable warriors who quickly solved tactical problems offered by technologically expert foes. Ask the 7th Cavalry; they know that tale all too well. Here the Indians never get it and it falls to their white savior to outfight the Vikings. Was this really necessary? What does this add to the story? Im thinking that instead of Karl Urban why didnt the Rudy Youngblood of ""Apocalypto"" star? He was a pretty good hand with a flint knife if I recall. Possibly that would have led to an unintentionally onomatopoeic credit ""Starring Rudy Youngblood and Moon Bloodgood."" Not that theres anything objectionable about Bloodgood doing a yeomans duty tour in the thankless role of the Native American princess even if she looks as if she just stepped off the runway at the House of Givenchy (well no; shes too curvaceous to be a model but the point is boy is she beautiful). Anyway the movie really devolves into an infantile hour and 40 minutes of head- and limb-lopping against a fairy tale backdrop (much CGI amplification) of a story that makes ""Conan the Barbarian"" seem like Dostoevski in its complexity. Pathfinder (100 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for extreme battle violence.
