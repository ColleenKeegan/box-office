Casting its star as a chain-smoking exorcist -- someone whos literally been to hell and back -- this adaptation of the graphic novel ""Hellblazer"" blazes few new trails and bogs down in a confusing narrative muddle. Atmospheric and noirish in the manner of a poor mans ""Blade Runner"" pic possesses powerful imagery but lacks feature-length substance and will need a bountiful harvest of opening-weekend souls before a stench resembling brimstone dowses its box office flame. Keanu Reeves latest man-in-black fantasy is slightly better than ""The Matrix"" sequels which is tantamount to damnation with faint praise. Casting its star as a chain-smoking exorcist -- someone whos literally been to hell and back -- this adaptation of the graphic novel ""Hellblazer"" blazes few new trails and bogs down in a confusing narrative muddle. Atmospheric and noirish in the manner of a poor mans ""Blade Runner"" pic possesses powerful imagery but lacks feature-length substance and will need a bountiful harvest of opening-weekend souls before a stench resembling brimstone dowses its box office flame. Director Francis Lawrences lengthy musicvideo resume includes award-winning work with Justin Timberlake but the major malfunction here is more of the storytelling than wardrobe variety. The biggest problem is that most viewers not familiar with pics relatively obscure source wont be able to comprehend the movies arcane set of rules. Whats left then is an episodic series of encounters -- some more visually arresting than others -- with no strong throughline pointing to where the actions ultimately heading. Nor does it help that Reeves must wrestle with what amounts to a Philip Marlowe-type role as the world-weary and dour John Constantine -- a man cursed by his ability to see the demons that venture into our plane. Once driven to a suicide attempt by those visions Constantine seeks to gain redemption from the scorching fate that awaits him because of that act by dispatching Satans minions back to hell. Meanwhile his cancer-ridden lungs leave him facing his own fast-approaching expiration date. ""I already know exactly where Im going"" he grumbles. Peculiar goings-on indicate that something big and sinister is coming as demons violate the devils pact with God by invading our mortal sphere. Along the way Constantine encounters a cop Angela (Rachel Weisz) directed to him following the death of her twin sister whose psychic abilities somehow figure in the plot by the otherworldly forces attempting to ""cross over."" Constantine is surrounded by a reasonably colorful group of supporting players though few receive enough screentime to establish much of a presence. The roster includes a wild-haired aide (Max Baker) eager sidekick Chas (""Project Greenlights"" Shia LeBeouf) a beady-eyed priest (Pruitt Taylor Vince) and a club-owning witch doctor (Djimon Hounsou). The principally two-character piece nevertheless centers on Reeves and Weisz punctuated by effective if fleeting special effects but saddled with a malnourished plot. Beyond the occasional wry aside Reeves doesnt bring enough heft to his character to sell the tough-guy dialogue and under the circumstances Weisz cant do much more than come across as a damsel in distress. Muted cinematography and the grunge-chic decor also contribute to a lifeless tone and much of the exposition is so garbled in portentous nonsense as to recall Rick Moranis possessed ranting in ""Ghostbusters."" Indeed whatever meticulous plotting might have gone into the novel the movie too often seems to be conjuring up twists as it goes along. By the time the climactic sequence arrives even Satan himself (a well-cast Peter Stormare) cant generate the heat required to salvage things. Pic does win a few points for style if not substance -- from the impressively realized depiction of hell and Tilda Swintons striking winged angel Gabriel to Brian Tyler and Klaus Badelts brooding score. Reeves affiliation with ""The Matrix"" trilogy has burnished his popularity within the comics/sci-fi realm but such goodwill goes only so far. Like the demonic hordes ""Constantine"" looks destined to discover that in the harsh light of day its not always easy to cross over.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Born a reluctant saviour of us all torn twixt two realities by his second-sight ability to see the half-breed angels and demons that walk among us Constantine killed himself at the age of 15 only to earn a two-minute tour of Hell (which looks like LA in case youre wondering) a dose of lung cancer (Keanu says dont smoke kids) and a return ticket back to purgatory on Earth.So far his craven attempts to bob-a-job his way into Heaven by saving souls have failed to impress Him upstairs as androgyne Gabriel (Tilda Swinton) sweetly puts it Youre fucked. Until Rachel (acting her socks off) Weiszs sceptical cop Angela (subtle) asks him to investigate the death of her twin sister offering Consters one final shot at true self-sacrifice. Darker than Hellboy more complex than Elektra this latest speech-bubble-to-screen adaptation creaks more towards the good (godlike Coen Bros fave Peter Stormare as Satan) than the bad (Reeves Reeves Reeves Burn) thanks largely to an intriguingly twisted script and the admirable CGI-restraint of Justin Timberlakes video-director Francis Lawrence. Proof perhaps that the devil does indeed have the best tunes... until evil triumphs and Constantine topples into a hell-fire of plot Babel that makes The Matrix Revolutions seem clear as the Pope and an unholy Devil ex Machina twist thats entirely beyond redemption.

John Constantine was born with X-ray vision that allows him to spot the angels and demons who walk the Earth as half-breeds yet pass as ordinary humans. The strain of his unwanted gift having proved intolerable Constantine tried as a youth to kill himself but was resuscitated -- albeit as a marked man predestined by God or heavy smoking or both for an early grave. Or as a no-nonsense angel Gabriel (played by Tilda Swinton cinemas It-girl of brainy androgyny) pithily puts it ""Youre fucked."" Condemned to patrol the borders between heaven and hell also known as Los Angeles Constantine tries to buy reprieve by sorting the divine wheat from the diabolical chaff and dispatching the latter back to the netherworld a conventionally fiery-orange charnel house located just beneath the steamy manholes of downtown and populated by predatory worm-eaten shape-shifters with empty eye sockets. Constantine was inspired by the DC Comics/Vertigo Hellblazer graphic novels described on their Web site as ""a mature-readers title"" which I take as a reference to precociously literate boys between the ages of 12 and 30. Im not being mean The novels which began life as dryly iconoclastic grunge critiques of 1980s life in Thatcherite Britain have a smart-aleck juvenile appeal not lost in translation to an unmistakably American sensibility that pits an apocalyptic Catholic determinism against a bleak but bracing existentialism leavened with high-testosterone vigilante calisthenics. Notwithstanding a dispiritingly banal script credited to Kevin Brodbin and Frank Cappello but showing all the flattening signs of collective meddling Constantine is an imaginative if overstuffed attempt to chart the boundaries of American spiritual life. The movie is its own kind of half-breed riddled with schisms both Christian and corporate. Constantine and his grinning nemesis Balthazar (Gavin Rossdale) are intermediaries for Gabriel and Lucifer (Peter Stormare) and of all these only Constantine played by Reeves with suitably noirish inexpressiveness is not wearing a power suit. Charged with exorcising the half-demons Constantine is the most ambivalent and unsolicitous of heroes. Hes irritated by the inability of a drunken priest (played by Heavys Pruitt Taylor Vince he of the swiveling eyes) to function as an exorcist and only does the job himself to purchase a longer lease on life. But when a local cop (Rachel Weisz) who comes to him with doubts about the apparent suicide of her clairvoyant twin sister finds herself dogged by a fully formed Horrid Thing Constantine begins to realize that the precarious balance between good and evil hes charged with maintaining is tilting in the wrong direction. For a movie thats ambivalent at best about institutionalized religion Constantine is washed through with baroque Catholic ambience studded with ancient relics and talismans and fire-breathing authority figures. Director Francis Lawrence a graduate of music videos like most hot new creators of neo-noir flicks for the barely-of-age has perfected a visceral in-your-face visual style (the cinematographer is Philippe Rousselot who has worked a lot with Tim Burton) that never lets up. By the time I stumbled blinking out onto the studio lot I was astonished to discover that no one around me had half a face or a smoldering hole where once sat a nose or an abdomen writhing under attack by some murderous parasite from a source other than the commissary lunch. Yet Constantine which opts in the end for what I can only describe as a kind of supernatural humanism is not without its spiritual satisfactions. For those of us in the audience who have difficulty accommodating any kind of a Higher Being the movies funniest and most touching moment is when Constantine confronts a chastened Gabriel disheveled and left with only the stumps of her magnificent wings and slugs her a good one. ""Thats called pain"" he says. ""Get used to it.""

Pictures supernatural thriller ""Constantine"" also starring Rachel Weisz. David James/Warner Brothers CONSTANTINE18 KEANU REEVES in Warner Bros. Pictures supernatural thriller ""Constantine"" also starring Rachel Weisz. David James/Warner Brothers Straight to hell with you naughty half-demons 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Constantine Thriller. Starring Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz. Directed by Francis Lawrence. (R. 121 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Constantine"" is a seriously unpleasant movie filled with repellent images of demons with dripping fangs swarms of devouring insects and people with their faces chewed off. As the hero Keanu Reeves goes through the movie coughing and spitting up blood because he plays a man dying of lung cancer. The movie isnt hellish because theres always hope of leaving it. Its more like purgatory two whole hours of it. For all the work it puts an audience through ""Constantine"" doesnt provide any mitigating rewards. The thinking side of the movie is a washout. Supposedly coming from a Catholic point of view its theologically confused at best; mainly its puerile. The movie has Rachel Weisz whose alert self- possession is always an asset but she has no chemistry with Reeves When the leading man is smoking gagging coughing up fluid and dying through most scenes its hard to get happy when he kisses somebody. ""Constantine"" has two things to its credit however that deserve mention. Occasionally the film conveys the eerie sense that theres a shadow world behind the world of surfaces that we know that there are angels and demons everywhere invisible influencing life on earth. For the movie to have been successful this sense needed to be ever-present and built upon from scene to scene. Here its only intermittent suffocated by mindless action and mindlessness in general. The movies other virtue is that the designers have come up with a plausibly horrific hell. Over the course of the action several characters visit hell and it turns out to be very red and hot with a lot of emaciated demons running around on all fours. Thats on the surface. Then on the lower level is a churning sea of former humanity all in agony. By the way has anyone ever noticed that no one is fat in hell? Does this mean that only thin people are evil or does the devil just put everybody on a diet? I suspect the latter. ""Constantine"" is based on the ""Hellblazer"" comic books and is directed by Francis Lawrence whose previous experience was entirely in music videos. The screenplay was written by Kevin Brodbin (""The Glimmer Man"") and Frank Cappello (""Suburban Commando"") who both have backgrounds in action. Just based on the resumes the movie was set up to be exactly what it became -- heavy on visuals but with no one onboard either inclined or capable of dealing with the movies spiritual themes in anything resembling a serious or adult manner. Constantine is just a guy in a black coat who smokes. He specializes in sending half-demons back to hell but now hes noticing that full demons -- you know the ones with tenure -- are crossing the line between hell and earth in violation of a long-standing truce between God and Lucifer. Obviously the devil is up to something big and it seems to have something to do with the unexpected suicide of a mental patient whose twin sister Angela (Weisz) is a police detective. Soon Constantine and Angela have teamed up in order to find out why the twin sister killed herself assuming she did. This turns both of them into targets for demonic harassment. Whenever the movie threatens to get so introspective as to be almost watchable and coherent something goes haywire and next thing we know half-headed demons -- they look like the tops of their heads have been sawed off -- are gamboling about and springing into attack from all sides. Theres nothing to be said for the performances. This directors interest is only in moving bodies around. Tilda Swinton appears as the angel Gabriel. Nice wings. Its a measure of the weakness of the screenplay -- or was this a calculated bid for a sequel? -- that ""Constantine"" doesnt have a conventional ending. It just stops as though thanks to the prayers of the living the audience members were granted a sudden reprieve. -- Advisory The film contains gruesome slayings and disturbing images of hell and demons.

YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Keanu Reeves Rachel Weisz Movies or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? (CNN) -- The title role of John Constantine in the new science fiction thriller ""Constantine"" is actually tailor-made for the limited talents of Keanu Reeves. His vacant ""nobodys home"" delivery is perfect for this antihero a demon-hunter who is caught between heaven and hell.It also helps that whiz-bang computer generated special effects and not Reeves are the real stars of this film. Of course all of Reeves most successful movies have that same common denominator.Based on a character from the DC comics ""Hellblazer"" series Constantine is cursed by the images of half-breed angels and demons who roam the world -- in this case the streets of Los Angeles.Apparently long ago God and the devil made a wager for the souls of all mankind. God and the devil are restricted from having direct contact with the human race but these half-breeds are free to roam the earth trying to influence people toward either good or evil.From early childhood Constantine is one of the few humans who could actually see these creatures as they really are -- to the rest of us they appear to be normal people. The images were so disturbing that he attempted suicide as a teenager. He failed but he did spend two minutes in hell.Now he spends his life trying to redeem himself. Since this story is based on Catholic dogma and suicide is a mortal sin Constantine is destined to return to hell at the end of his life here on earth. Hes hoping that if he sends enough demons back to where they came from hell get a reprieve in the form of a one-way ticket to the Pearly Gates.But suddenly the rules seem to be changing. The demon half-breeds are beginning to appear as they really are and are attempting to take over the world.Of course only one person on earth can prevent this from happening. You have three guesses as to who that person is and the first two dont count.Still heroes -- or antiheroes -- are supposed to save the world and movie audiences know it. The question becomes how is the ride?Well ""Constantines"" ride starts off with one hell (pardon the pun) of a big bang. Its a promising opening but unfortunately -- with a few exceptions -- the rest of the action in the film feels extremely fragmented. It cant quite live up to this ""jump-out-of-your-seat"" beginning.Fortunately the script is populated with some great supporting characters beginning with an L.A. detective Angela Dodson played with great conviction by Rachel Weisz (who incidentally co-starred with Reeves in ""Chain Reaction"" in 1996). A devout Catholic shes trying to prove her twin sister did not commit suicide. Her investigation leads to Constantine and shes drawn into his world of demons and half-breeds.Djimon Hounsou has a flashy role as a faith healer named Midnight who runs a nightclub that is a sanctuary for half-breeds from both sides of the battle between good and evil. Its nice to know that after a hard day of trying to save -- or ravage -- human souls these hard working demons and half-breeds have a nice neutral place to let their hair down.But the best role is played by the exceptional actress Tilda Swinton who portrays an androgynous angel Gabriel Gods gatekeeper on Earth. She has a grudge against Constantine regarding his efforts to buy his way back into Gods good graces. Her scenes with Reeves are the most interesting in the film.""Constantine"" is the feature film directorial debut for music video director Francis Lawrence. Visually his film is stunning. However as is often the case in movies heavily layered with special effects those effects ultimately overwhelm the story.But ""Constantine"" does have its pleasures and Reeves fan base will probably be pleased with this film. They already know he cant act and they dont care. Also there are plenty of young moviegoers who love this type of film genre and have never met a gory special effect they didnt love.For all of them ""Constantine"" will be something less than purgatory.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

In the Goth mind-set of who-knows-how-many screenwriters there can apparently be nothing creepier than a dive/dance bar populated by the demonic undead in which youll find your Lestats your Lost Boys your Catherine Deneuves. And so the City of Angels is a natural set piece for ""Constantine"" a dreary (and possibly profane for certain Sunday schoolers) action thriller rife with theo-core cliches owed to everyone from Linda Blair to the Baltimore Catechism to ""Oh God You Devil"" It isnt long before Keanu Reevess freelance exorcist character John Constantine makes his semi-regular visit to the Devil Bar (or whatever) where the beautiful demon clientele (Gwen Stefanis husband among them; demons adore pinstriped Armani suits) couldnt be blamed for mistaking Constantine for Neo from the ""Matrix"" trilogy Reeves wears essentially the same black wardrobe does the same moves shows off the same galling lack of acting ability but with a slightly different haircut. (Is there any actor besides Keanu whos gotten more employment for doing so little?) Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is back from Hell and looking to save his soul through a combination of good works and special effects. (David James -- Warner Bros.

In his teens he couldnt take it anymore and killed himself and went to Hell which looks like Texas chili in a blender set on slow speed -- its very swirly and dark orange. Hell sent Constantine back to Earth and Heaven wont have him but luckily hes found an enormous loft apartment above an old Hollywood bowling alley and it has original tile floors. (Smokin) Tilda Swinton playing a menacing but ridiculous angel Gabriel sometimes taunts Constantine about this limbo dilemma -- hes part of a game a power struggle between God and Satan and its something thats going to involve a lot of quick-edit cuts of spooky relics and computer-generated bad guys. Constantine has fatalistically chain-smoked his way into a pretty nasty case of lung disease so time is running short for him to save his soul. Hes doing this by seeking out the possessed and exorcising their demons. Much of ""Constantine"" simply portends. Oh how it portends from the opening exorcism Constantine performs in a barrio tenement to the mumbo-jumbo of quasi-religious imagery that concludes the movie. Markings on morgue corpses portend. Locusts portend. Mirrors portend. Symbology runs amok here and characters are always looking things up in crumbly tomes to verify the true meaning of this or that which may play fairly well to the same mania that propelled ""The Da Vinci Code"" to cult status. If the Catholic Church wasnt so wrapped up in other litigations you wonder if it could sue some filmmakers for ancient trademark infringements or some sort of character defamation. Priests here are seen as corpulent and alcoholic as usual in movies; praying is seen as a naive waste of time by the machine-gun toting Constantine. Even a lapsed Catholic will groan aloud at some of the misrepresentations of sacramental and theological dogma and not only at the still-persistent fixation on the seldom-used rites of exorcism. Rachel Weisz shows up as an LAPD detective seeking a funeral Mass for her twin sister who has mysteriously committed suicide while in a hospital psych ward. She is told by her priest that in no uncertain terms will the church perform a funeral for any suicide victim. (Wrong. That teaching is far outdated; at the discretion of parish priests or bishops the churchs Order for Christian Funerals allows prayers and funeral rites for all its dearly departed.) But enough catechism class. Of course youd rather talk about the Spear of Destiny (Its a relic that was believed to have been used to stab Christs torso as he hung on the cross.) Its been found Wrapped in a Nazi flag in a Mexican garbage dump Are you with us? Manuel the stereotypical peasant who scavenges the spear is immediately zombified and begins his trek to Los Angeles to use the Spear to call forth Mammon the Son of Satan. Its going to be a long trip and only Constantine and Rachel Weisz (and the ingratiating Shia LaBeouf and dont forget Djimon Hounsou as the Voodoo Pimp Daddy from the Devil Bar) stand in the way of the rise of the Antichrist. Swedish actor Peter Stormare who played the creepy eyeball-transplant surgeon in ""Minority Report"" shows up and shames the acting skills of Keanu et al. with his surprisingly understated (and as such convincingly frightening) performance as Satan. After so many cheap sci-fi devils its a brief pleasure to be tempted by Stormares gentle evil but its a fleeting one and soon enough he slithers back to the chili swirls of Hades. Thus concludes this hackneyed cheap-looking episode of ""CSI Revelation."" Constantine (121 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for profanity violent scenes and demonic imagery.

Stuck in the supernatural Keanu Reeves drifts between two worlds. Warner Bros. Pictures This spinoff of the Hellblazer graphic novel drops Reeves into a visually nocturnal parallel universe. This time that universe is called Los Angeles. (Related item Watch the trailer) The film tries to pass off its star as a private eye of sorts even making his character a lifelong chain-smoker. In truth Reeves has been better in more movies than not -- but if there were ever an actor who shouldnt go the hard-boiled route were looking at him here. The smoking has taken its toll. As Reeves John Constantine walks around dying of lung cancer heaven doesnt want him and hell does and hes wondering whether theres an alternative. Meanwhile theres work to do. Someone with real troubles is upside down crawling on all fours on a hotel ceiling. Call the exorcist or in this case call Keanu. Then if youre director Francis Lawrence cut to a shot of a maid genuflecting. Its all part of a supernatural sleuths daily routine sorting out the minions emissaries and lackeys employed by heaven or hell and walking around among us. About the movie Constantine  1/2 (out of four) Stars Keanu Reeves Rachel Weisz Shia LaBeouf Djimon Hounsou Tilda Swinton Director Francis Lawrence Distributor Warner Bros. Rated R for violence and demonic images Opens Friday nationwide The hellish ones are causing lots of trouble and related property destruction. Look out for the guy at the convenience store beef jerky display; he might be one of them. Constantine also gives work to Djimon Hounsou Shia LaBeouf and Tilda Swinton (looking loopy in wings as the angel Gabriel though a great Match.com possibility for Bruno Ganz in Wings of Desire). The only other role of note goes to Rachel Weisz as a cop whose twin sister has just killed herself in a mental hospital. Though Weisz does more for the movie than it does for her her acting never combusts with Reeves. So where are we? In two hours of Dullsville as Sinatra used to say. The movie gets progressively sillier so much so that a recruited audience -- predominantly ""real people"" not critics -- was hooting up a storm during the climactic scenes at my screening. Its really discomfiting to ponder the few decent choices there have been so far this year then trying to decide whether Inside Deep Throat or Poohs Heffalump Movie is the better movie.

After all the actor turns (brace yourselves) 41 in September. There are telltale lines in the face now. That skin is starting to say ""shelf life."" I say this with a certain existential beam because aging is not only inevitable but cool to see on an actor youve spent time with over the years. It means its okay for you to get old since theyre doing it in Hollywood. Why get into Reevess aging process? Because in ""Constantine"" you need something to study in those long-winded stretches between special-effects set pieces (the only good thing about this flawed movie). And if you are a fan of the ""Hellblazer"" comic book series on which this movie is based youll definitely need a distraction. The relation between ""Constantine"" and its source material is at best superfluous. The disparity starts with the original John Constantine (Reevess character) being from Liverpool England. Reeves from the city of John and Paul? As if. As John Constantine Keanu Reeves is on a supernatural mission to exorcise demons -- and find his own redemption -- in ""Constantine"" a thriller based on the ""Hellblazer"" comic book series.

He can reenter the underworld when necessary. (It takes being in contact with water and astrally breaking into the other dimension; you know the stuff Reeves does all the time.) He is on a long-term quest to redeem himself. I cant remember what for but he is clearly a busy man either exorcising the satanically possessed or sending half-breeds (demon-humans) back to hell where they belong. His main mission involves helping Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) whose twin sister Isabel (also played by Weisz) has plunged into hell after an apparent suicide leap. Angela is convinced some dark force was behind her sisters death since Isabel was a staunch Catholic and would never take her own life. There are interested parties watching Constantine as he helps Angela the angel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton) and the Big Bad Guy From Below himself played with amusing campiness by Peter Stormare. ""Constantine"" has some great visual passages to do with images of hell burning and all that kind of spiritually apocalyptic business. Filmmaker Francis Lawrence a former music video director creates a nice comic book look with these scenes as well as oblique and extreme camera angles -- just as youd see in the comics. But the screenplay by Frank A. Cappello and Kevin Brodbin is only interesting for a few characters hardly the story. It invests too much down-and-dull time with Constantine and Angela. And although hes occasionally amusing as Constantines lackey Chas Chandler Shia LaBeouf (a transparent attempt to draw in preteen audiences to an R-rated film) brings nothing extra to the movie. Which brings us back to Reeves whos endearing for his seeming offhandedness as if hes only doing this performing thing because a few things fell into place at the right time. Like he could split anytime and play bass full time for his band Dogstar you know? Or just hang in some scenic corner of Seattle shooting the you-know with Gus Van Sant. He makes us think heck we could be doing that superhero stuff too gum wrapper balled-up ATM receipt and 12 cents in our back pockets fighting with supernatural forces and never completely breaking a sweat because well come on its just a movie. And while Reeves keeps us centered Swinton takes us back into the otherworldly dimension. Only she can play Gabriel and get away with it as if she knows Gabriel personally and is simply imitating a well-known acquaintance. Waiting for this two-hour movie to end you could do worse than enjoy those polar-mint faraway eyes and the half-smile on that chiseled alabaster mouth. Now thats a serious angel. CONSTANTINE (R 121 minutes) -- Contains obscenity violence and scenes from hell with dudes who are like seriously damned for all time and have no flesh on their bones. Area theaters.

"Constantine | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; constantine ) Constantine (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Rarely has the question ""What the hell?"" been more appropriate. An uneven amalgamation of the brilliant and the preposterous Constantine left me by turns intrigued confused and wary. The recipe calls for some ingredients that are compelling others that are audacious and others that are downright maddening. With a bold dynamic visual style that fuses film noir elements with traditional horror motifs Constantine can be considered many things but dull is not amongst them. This is not a timid film yet its not an entirely successful one either. Theres an inherent danger in telling a story about angels devils God and Lucifer in that its very easy to lose a sizable portion of the audience. Theres a reason why authors not named Dante shy away from this subject. Some will see it as sacrilegious. Others will see it as silly. The suspension of disbelief curve is steep and it becomes steeper when the movie throws in elements of black magic and occult philosophy. One would think that matters couldnt get more clear-cut than in a battle between the forces of heaven and the minions of hell. But Constantine finds a way to turn everything a murky shade of gray. Good and evil it seems arent as absolute as we might like to believe. John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is a reluctant hero. Cursed to be able to see through the guises that normally hide angelic and demonic beings from human perception Constantine is aware that the battle between heaven and hell isnt some distant unfathomable struggle. It is being played out in the here-and-now with the souls of human beings as its currency. In his youth Constantine was overwhelmed by his visions and tried to take his own life. He was sent back and has been trying to atone for his suicide and buy his way into heaven by destroying demons. It isnt working though. Constantine lacks faith as the angelic Gabriel (Tilda Swinton) constantly reminds him. Gods messenger isnt the only one to torment the bitter protagonist. The unsavory Balthazar (Gavin Rossdale) delights in the news that Constantine has terminal lung cancer. Something wicked this way comes. Satans son is plotting a cross-over into the material plane in violation of every established rule. Aided by a Los Angeles cop Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) who can also see the damned Constantine prepares to set himself opposite the greatest evil this planet has known. And when an expected ally turns out to be involved in the conspiracy he is forced to seek aid from the most unlikely of sources - the Prince of Darkness himself (Peter Stormare without horns or other prosthetics). Saving the world is a thankless job. Just ask Constantine although hes looking for redemption not gratitude. He figures that if he scores enough points for heaven God will relent and grant him absolution for his unpardonable sin. (For those who dont know Catholic doctrine suicide = a direct non-refundable ticket to hell. Do not pass limbo. Do not collect 200 indulgences.) Although Satan eventually shows up to banter with Constantine God stays out of the picture. One senses that if we glimpsed him he might look like George Burns. Constantines core strength lies in its visual presentation. First-time director Francis Lawrence cut his teeth in the music video business and he brings a lot of imagination to developing a vivid palette. Theres almost always something to see whether its a hellfire-tinged mirror image of Los Angeles or the hedonistic innards of a nightclub that caters to those of both angelic and demonic persuasion. In fact the film looks so good that its almost possible to ignore some of the screenplays ludicrous turn of events. Plotting is not one of Constantines assets. You cant think too much while watching this movie or the carefully constructed house of cards it erects will come crashing down. The source material is the ""Hellblazer"" series of graphic novels and the goal of the screenplay is to replicate the tone and point-of-view of the comic books. In the process it seems that not all of the background has been shoehorned in. Its hard to say what causes the gaping plot holes marring Constantines narrative highway but they are as unavoidable as Gabriels warped deluded speech. Keanu Reeves who filmed Constantine immediately after being immersed in the Matrix sequels is in Neo mode. There are superficial differences - Constantine is less likeable and more cynical - but Reeves plays the two as spiritual kinsmen. After all it took a full movie before Neo came to accept his role as the Chosen One. Rachel Weisz looking for a good companion piece on her resume for the Mummy flicks has found it. She lends a dash of class to the proceedings arguing the case that sometimes good actors can rise above mediocre screenplays. The supporting cast is eclectic Shia LeBeouf as Constantines assistant Djimon Hounsou as the ""neutral"" club owner Midnite Pruitt Taylor Vince as a priest and Tilda Swinton at her most androgynous as Gabriel. Constantine will appeal most strongly to those with a penchant for vivid cinematic comic book adaptations. It remains to be seen whether it will find its audience or end up ignored by viewers expecting another installment of The Matrix or a more traditional horror movie.
