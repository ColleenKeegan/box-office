Has any other performer derived this much joy from acting this undignified? Carrey plays a pathological leech a cable-TV serviceman who latches onto a yuppie customer (Matthew Broderick) and convinces himself that the poor sap is his new best buddy. Calling himself Chip Douglas (from My Three Sons one of the shows that haunt his TV-addled brain) he invades Brodericks home and office leaving endless messages on his answering machine crashing -- and I mean crashing -- his amateur basketball game bombarding him with pop-psych homilies on how to win back his girlfriend and in general turning his pursuit of ""friendship"" into a thinly disguised act of sadistic terrorism. Some of this is amusing if overly familiar in the renegade-nuisance style of comedies like What About Bob? and Neighbors. Then comes a scene that may shock you into laughter (or out of it). The cable guy follows Brodericks girlfriend (Leslie Mann) to a restaurant and posing as a restroom attendant proceeds to kick the living hell out of her unctuous date smashing him onto the floor and sticking a live blow dryer in his mouth. For a few moments Carrey blurs the line between comic dementia and real dementia. Hes funny and scary at the same time; his demons have come out to play. Usually were on Jim Carreys side grooving on his mind warps cracking up at his cracked-mirror happy face. But in The Cable Guy our sympathies are divided between Broderick the nice-guy hero and Carrey the deranged sociopathic imp. The star has never played this single-minded a pest before and that may be one reason The Cable Guy lacks the exhilaration of his best work. Reined in by the characters evil lisp his stunted camp hostility Carrey cant fling his imagination a thousand ways as he did in the second Ace Ventura movie (or more recently on Saturday Night Live). The director Ben Stiller works with craftsmanly precision but too much control can dampen madness. When Carrey grabs the microphone of a karaoke machine and launches into a nerdy-ecstatic rendition of Jefferson Airplanes ""Somebody to Love"" part of the release is that the scene serves no real purpose. You feel that he couldnt hold himself back; he had to sing that song (and sing it that magnificently badly). The Cable Guy needed more highs like that one. The movie flirts with a darker Carrey but ironically most of it gives us a safer Carrey an anarchist caught in routines too patterned to let him break loose.

Comments The Cable Guy This curious piece of work (1996) starring Jim Carrey and Matthew Broderick has been passed off as a comedy and I suppose I laughed a few times during the first third or so; but it coheres only as a vaguely homoerotic nightmare patterned loosely after Fatal Attraction with suggestive notations on TV pathology. As such its a fairly interesting effort--much more ambitious than most Carrey vehicles. Broderick plays an architect recently evicted by his girlfriend and getting settled in a new flat; the technician (Carrey) who sets him up with free cable turns out to be a lonely psychopathic control freak who makes his life miserable. Ben Stiller directs Lou Holtz Jr.s script with plenty of unsettling edge and Carrey throws himself into his part as if it meant something. With Leslie Mann George Segal Diane Baker and Jack Black.

A thin collection of comic constructs this entry from Jim Carrey is a career switch attached to a dimmer board. The premise is quite simple. Architect Steven Kovacs (Matthew Broderick) has been bounced by his girlfriend Robin (Leslie Mann) after proposing marriage. He moves into a new apartment and waits for the cable service technician to hook him up. The cable guy Chip Douglas (Carrey) is an electronics geek who is alternately bizarre and compassionate. Steven in a moment of weakness makes the mistake of agreeing to join him on a pilgrimage to the satellite dish where all electromagnetic signals converge. Its an intriguing enough jumping-off point. But instead of a narrative progression we are beset with a series of situations marked by mayhem. After its first surge of energy the film goes on the blink and never recovers. Carreys character lacks the empathy or poignance to command ongoing interest and Brodericks role strains ones patience because hes hopelessly dimwitted and slow to react in any way vaguely resembling human behavior.

Starring Jim Carrey Matthew Broderick and Leslie Mann. Directed by Ben Stiller. (PG-13. 91 minutes. At the Alexandria Kabuki Northpoint and Century Plaza.) Jim Carreys dark side is way dark. In ""The Cable Guy"" opening today at Bay Area theaters Carrey plunges into the demonic as a cable TV installer ""who can be your best friend or your worst enemy."" Hes brilliant at times but mostly a turnoff as a guy whos always on. ""The Cable Guy"" doesnt know when to pull the plug. Much of the film plays like a personal boob tube with Carrey trapped inside determined to act his way out in a mugging freak show. Hes a disturbing mixture of psychopath and pathetically misguided lonely soul. ""Did I cross the line?"" he asks more than once. EARNEST VICTIM Carrey makes co-star Matthew Broderick playing mild-mannered architect Steven Kovacs come across as a saintly milquetoast. The earnest Kovacs is the person the cable guy picks to be his buddy/ victim. Hes also the only one to cheer for. The film directed by Ben Stiller is one of the oddest most down beat comedies since ""Pulp Fiction."" In a way its scarier because Carrey keeps popping up like Jack Nicholsons campy wacko in ""The Shining."" Yet theres a chilling sense that Carrey is not playing camp but is being serious. Do we need this lunatic in our moviegoing lives? Kovacs has just broken up with his girlfriend (Leslie Mann) and he takes a small apartment for a miserable stint of bachelorhood. He calls the cable company to get hooked up and Carrey shows up with bullying jokes a wildly dimpled grin and a too-personal observation that Kovacs new place ""smells like heartbreak to me."" Against his better judgment Kovacs offers to slip the cable guy an extra 50 to get all the premium channels free. Its an opening for Carrey to rush in with all his dark baggage. As always a little Carrey goes a long way. The cable guy who eventually identifies himself as Chip Douglas (and uses other names TV sitcom viewers will recognize) takes over Kovacs life with mind-controlling antics and plaintive lets-be-buddies appeals. The cable guy becomes a major pest a kooky friend a quirky confidant a stalker. Hes a bold emotional wreck who nearly drives Kovacs mad. At the same time he has the technical skills to provide the cable connection -- and other electronic services that go far beyond anything Kovacs wants or needs. He gives advice. And he follows up by electronically eavesdropping. SLAVES TO THE TUBE The film with many satirical references to television shows makes a huge leap when it introduces the throwaway concept that everybody is a slave to the tube and that cable is the juice powering their narcosis. In first-time writer Lou Holtz Jr.s screenplay though the idea is carried to such extremes that it becomes a leaden sophomoric joke. The cable guy makes dates with Kovacs (there are gay yet homophobic undertones to Carreys humor) and one of the first is a starlight visit to ""the information superhighway"" the cable companys big satellite dish. He also cruelly intrudes on Kovacs basketball game with buddies. But the wildest is an outing to an outlandish restaurant Medieval Times where costumed re-enactments of knights games are performed while diners eat and swill. The cable guy and a reluctant Kovacs don heavy armor and square off with swords broadaxes and jousting lances. The sequence gives Carrey a sizable sawdust arena in which to pull off some of his loony physical stunts. Curiously the bright spot of the drawn-out scene is a cameo by Janeane Garofalo as a cynical medieval waitress. Another big set piece is Carreys ""karaoke jam"" performance of Jefferson Airplanes ""Somebody to Love"" in which he brilliantly mocks and celebrates Grace Slicks 60s style. The scene puts an acidic twist on the karaoke craze -- one of a handful of inspired moments. Carrey is an amazing stuntman and a striking physical presence who tilts his talent to the diabolical in this film. He wears his hair in a longish crew cut with sideburns and juts his jaw so he looks like a palooka. He also affects a slight speech impediment supporting a mean running joke about Kovacs speech therapist brother. The films dark emotional tone is reinforced by its look. Downbeat shades of blues greens grays and browns mostly in Kovacs apartment fortify a claustrophobic feeling that is truly off-putting. Audiences may look to this film as a hint of Carreys promised transition to serious dramatic acting. Thats a little frightening.

Has any other performer derived this much joy from acting this undignified? Carrey plays a pathological leech a cable-TV serviceman who latches onto a yuppie customer (Matthew Broderick) and convinces himself that the poor sap is his new best buddy. Calling himself Chip Douglas (from My Three Sons one of the shows that haunt his TV-addled brain) he invades Brodericks home and office leaving endless messages on his answering machine crashing -- and I mean crashing -- his amateur basketball game bombarding him with pop-psych homilies on how to win back his girlfriend and in general turning his pursuit of ""friendship"" into a thinly disguised act of sadistic terrorism. Some of this is amusing if overly familiar in the renegade-nuisance style of comedies like What About Bob? and Neighbors. Then comes a scene that may shock you into laughter (or out of it). The cable guy follows Brodericks girlfriend (Leslie Mann) to a restaurant and posing as a restroom attendant proceeds to kick the living hell out of her unctuous date smashing him onto the floor and sticking a live blow dryer in his mouth. For a few moments Carrey blurs the line between comic dementia and real dementia. Hes funny and scary at the same time; his demons have come out to play. Usually were on Jim Carreys side grooving on his mind warps cracking up at his cracked-mirror happy face. But in The Cable Guy our sympathies are divided between Broderick the nice-guy hero and Carrey the deranged sociopathic imp. The star has never played this single-minded a pest before and that may be one reason The Cable Guy lacks the exhilaration of his best work. Reined in by the characters evil lisp his stunted camp hostility Carrey cant fling his imagination a thousand ways as he did in the second Ace Ventura movie (or more recently on Saturday Night Live). The director Ben Stiller works with craftsmanly precision but too much control can dampen madness. When Carrey grabs the microphone of a karaoke machine and launches into a nerdy-ecstatic rendition of Jefferson Airplanes ""Somebody to Love"" part of the release is that the scene serves no real purpose. You feel that he couldnt hold himself back; he had to sing that song (and sing it that magnificently badly). The Cable Guy needed more highs like that one. The movie flirts with a darker Carrey but ironically most of it gives us a safer Carrey an anarchist caught in routines too patterned to let him break loose.
