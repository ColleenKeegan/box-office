"amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> The Da Vinci Code amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews Shadowboxer >> The Da Vinci Code Lets pray there is no afterlife because Id hate to be trapped with Tom Hanks for eternity.  Its not only the atrocious hair which was bad in Splash worse in Philadelphia (that Morrissey curl) and simply foul in Forrest Gump.  Its that ever since his first Oscar when he banished the demons of Turner and Hooch and became Academy Award Winner Tom Hanks hes obliged himself to pick gilded solemn parts that match his trophy and are equally stiff. Hanks Robert Langdon is yet another one of his self-serious bores.  Hes a genius who bears a remarkable resemblance to a crumpled paper bag; his face clothes and hair seem to sag on his frame like embarrassed teenagers trying to put some distance between themselves and his pedantry.  A Harvard symbologist hes in Paris doling out his brains when a police captain (Jean Reno) rudely rips him from his book signing and drags him to the Louvre to check out a corpse.  Captain Bezu is no scholar so when Hanks rhapsodizes about the entranceways pyramidal architecture he rolls his eyes and replies ""Fascinating."" When Hanks and Audrey Tautou (as Sophie the code-breaker) join forces theres scant worry that theyll be forced into an unappetizing snogging session as their characters do in the book.  Theyre being chased by a battalion of violent cops and Christians for one so theres little time to admire Tautous wan beauty drained here of its Amelie glow.  Their worst enemy however is Dan Browns gargantuan bestseller. What seems credible on page is ludicrous in action.  Movies compress pages of information into seconds and the shrinking scale of tension magnifies their implausibilities.  The chapter when Robert and Sophie realize that Sauniere the dead man in the museum spent his last minutes alive leaving a trail of clues around the Louvre to start them on their nerd quest is laughable in its 60 seconds on screen.  Its impossible not to call bullshit on Saunieres insanely inscrutable treasure hunt when your eyes are rapidly taking in the gallerys elephantine hallways mussed by his blood.  Same goes for the logic puzzles that have a stranglehold on the plot.  Anagrams riddles Fibonacci backwards fonts.  The sleuthing duo cant even enter their friends mansion without answering three riddles on British culture.  No time for chemistry or conversation; theres yet another brain-twister to solve. Browns indulgent witness statement for his plagiary trial admitted that his favorite pulpy tactic is to pepper his books with experts.  That way he can catch readers up to speed on say the history of the Knights of Templar with a multi-page lecture.  Sewn throughout 450 leisurely pages these bookish interludes are more interesting than irritating.  Crammed shoulder to shoulder into a film however and Hanks might caution ""Ron Howard we have a problem.""  Unlucky Sophie spends the middle third of her film acting a fool.  ""Who are they?"" she says prompting Hanks to expound on Opus Dei.  ""Whats that?"" she wonders as a religious scholar (sole highlight Ian McKellan) holds court on the history of the Holy Grail.  Its like cramming for Catholic school under gunpoint. Aware of the soporific minefield director Howard jazzes up the action.  Each lecture is overlaid with flashback.  Of course Christian history is all prayers and anger so every flashback is a variation on a crowd shaking their fists in fury.  The umpteen puzzles get the game show treatment with gratuitous laser graphics and an dramatically-scored sequence involving a web browser.  ""Ive got to get to a library - fast"" gushes Hanks.  Ive got to get to the grocery store which would be only marginally less exciting. Heres my theory on Browns astounding stateside success his high brow thrillers both flatter and enrich.  By focusing them on works of common yet not base knowledge (the Mona Lisa Jesus) he makes his readers feel smart.  Then his (occasionally fraudulent) take on these sign points lets people feel their education rose along with their pulse like swallowing a delicious vitamin.  Also hes an equal opportunity offender which is great fun for both blue and red state bookworms.  Wheres the secular humanist uprising against Browns insult that a liberal intellectual who bemoans that  ""as long as there has been one true god there has been killing in his name"" would try to establish peace....with a gun.  Thats logic that only makes sense if youre in the White House.  At least if Dan Brown was president kids might be reading at a higher level than My Pet Goat.

Columbia Pictures hide caption toggle caption Columbia Pictures A play on Leonardos sketch The Vitruvian Man gets the symbolism going in a clue-riddled plot. hide caption toggle caption Paul Bettany playing the monk Silas menaces Tautou. Columbia Pictures hide caption toggle caption Columbia Pictures Youve probably already heard all about The Da Vinci Codes secret given the tens of millions of copies Dan Browns book has sold since its release three years ago. So lets just skim the surface of the plot. Robert Langdon played by Tom Hanks is an expert on symbols -- a ""symbologist"" if you will -- who is lecturing in Paris when the police contact him about a murder. A curator at the Louvre has been found on the floor of the main art gallery his body positioned in a way that is clearly meant to send a message. Langdon realizes hes a three-dimensional recreation of Da Vincis sketch ""The Vitruvian Man"" with a pagan icon painted on his chest in blood. Langdon tells the chief of police that its an icon representing the female half of everything and right on cue in walks the female half of the story. Sophie is not a symbologist but a cryptologist -- a code decipher-er -- who can spot an anagram at 50 paces which comes in handy as they go on what amounts to a scavenger hunt trying to unravel not just a murder mystery but what turns out to be the Holy Grail of biblical mysteries. Feeling theyre out of their depth they turn to -- who else -- an eccentric British knight played by a pixie-ish Ian McKellen. He too traces things back to Da Vinci. Complications ensue. Now a number of controversies have attached themselves to The Da Vinci Code. Among them whether its secret is at root blasphemous whether its story is anti-Catholic and even whether it reinforces unfair stereotypes about albinos -- though Im not sure which ""stereotypes"" the crazed self-flagellating assassin albino monk Silas could be said to reinforce. Tom Hanks has been trying to defuse all of this in interviews by noting that the story is ""loaded with... hooey"" which Id say about gets it right. The question is why it isnt more robust invigorating hooey. The film like the novel is basically a series of long complicated conversations that are not made any less long or complicated by being intoned urgently at high speeds on highways. Director Ron Howard seems to have realized that he could bring a visual clarity to the books chatter about anagrams and cryptexes (a neologism coined by Brown in the novel) just as he did to the mathematics in A Beautiful Mind. So there are flashbacks to the middle ages and letters and paintings rearranging themselves digitally. But the problem with making things clear this time is that the story is sort of lame when its clear. On the page mixed in with Browns clumsy travel-guide descriptions of European tourist spots the twists have a certain mystery to them. Streamlined for the screen they fall pretty neatly into movie conventions so by the end of the first hour even folks who havent read the book will know basically where everythings headed. This leaves another hour-and-a-half of waiting for the characters to catch up. Or I suppose you could use the time to play with anagrams on your own. The title The Da Vinci Code seems a likely treasure-trove with all those vowels. One thing it yields when rearranged is ""Catch de video"" admittedly by misspelling that middle word and with a couple of letters left over. Okay thats a stretch but then so is the movie. Im Bob Mondello.

Well the moneys certainly there on screen as the elaborate puzzle surrounding the murder of a Louvre curator and the religious mystery that may not have died with him wends its tourist trail through Paris Londons Temple Church and Scotlands Rosslyn Chapel. But as Tom Hanks populist academic and his plucky sidekick Audrey Tautou (the dead mans grand-daughter) try to join the dots before sundry clerical and anti-clerical nasties get there first it swiftly becomes apparent theres a serious surfeit of plot over character. There are grandiose ideas here positing an alternative history of Christianity but to get to them reams and reams of questionable history and individual backstory have to be dutifully trotted out stretching credibility and leaving potentially arresting themes utterly uninvolving.All this gives the high-powered cast little to go on (though cranky professor Ian McKellen makes a better fist of it than most) while the slackly handled thriller elements fail to provide the pick-me-up the film desperately needs. Completing the trail of cryptic clues simply becomes an end in and of itself - think Sudoku The Movie - with little in the way of whimsy star chemistry or excitement to enliven the dour plod. One thing though if youre casting a self-flagellating Latin-speaking friar-hooded freaky-eyed albino psycho Paul Bettany is clearly your man. Decidedly missable.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

"Da Vinci Code The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; da-vinci-code-the ) Da Vinci Code The (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Perhaps a better title for The Da Vinci Code might be Much Ado about Nothing. When you boil away the hype and hysteria all that remains is a pedestrian murder mystery that isnt sufficiently challenging or scandalous to raise anyones hackles. Its preposterous overlong and saddled with a sloppy denouement that defines the term ""anti-climax."" The films two big ""surprises"" are telegraphed early and the ease with which they can be guessed (using the ""conservation of characters"" process) leeches the movie of a large measure of its suspense. Individual scenes are entertaining in their own right but the production as a whole is a lumbering mess. I intentionally avoided Dan Browns novel before seeing the movie (and dont intend to read it now that I have sat through the adaptation) hoping to provide a fresh perspective. Presumably the book which is often referred to as a ""compulsive page-turner"" is more riveting that its cinematic counterpart. The Da Vinci Code (the movie) is a mediocre thriller with too few thrills and too much predictable action. A murder in the Louvre sends Professor Robert Langdon a visiting ""symbologist"" from Harvard on the first steps of a dangerous journey that leads him into the heart of ""the greatest cover-up in human history"" - one that involves Opus Dei the Knights Templar cults artwork and a lot of things than happened 2000 years ago. His companion on the trek is French police officer Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou). They have been framed for the Louvre murder and Captain Fache (Jean Reno) a humorless cop whos hiding something is hot on their trail. Recognizing that they have uncovered the tip of a conspiracy that involves warring factions of the Catholic Church and the Holy Grail they seek ""Grail expert"" Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellan) who joins their quest. (Sadly the Monty Python troupe couldnt make it.) But the pursuit of Fache isnt the only thing they have to worry about. A murderous albino by the name of Silas (Paul Bettany) the ""pet"" of Bishop Sringarosa (Alfred Molina) has orders to eliminate them and take into custody an artifact they have in their possession. The Da Vinci Code has strange rhythms for a thriller. Bursts of action are interrupted by lengthy periods of exposition. The crime is essentially resolved around the two-hour mark leaving the movie nearly 30 minutes to muddle through to a drawn-out and predictable conclusion. Oddly the ""talky"" parts of the film are more interesting than the kinetic ones. Thats because when it comes to explaining the conspiracy The Da Vinci Code does an impressive job of blending fact speculation and pure fiction into a mix that is intriguing (albeit outlandish). The action sequences on the other hand are too straightforward to be more than distracting. The scenes that really shine are those in which director Ron Howard brings his skills as a visual director to bear. When we first meet Langdon he is lecturing on the meaning of symbols. The brief excerpt Howard provides of this talk is fascinating. Equally compelling is Teabings dissection of ""The Last Supper"" and his explanation of the nature of the Holy Grail. And theres a little inventiveness in the way Langdons visualization of Issac Newtons tomb is employed to break a code. Sadly as a director Howard also makes a major misstep with an unforgivable continuity gaffe (it involves a phone call). Although (I am told) this is explained in the book the explanation is not provided in the movie and it becomes an instance of slipshod misdirection. Is The Da Vinci Code blasphemous or sacrilegious? It certainly takes a negative view of Catholic doctrine and Church policies. (Poor maligned Opus Dei.) And it calls into question cornerstone aspects of Christian faith. Some may find this distasteful but the movie does not go out of its way to be insulting or condescending. The story is so outlandish as to be obviously fabricated with a minimal basis in fact. The Da Vinci Code is fanciful enough that it requires no debunking - that much should be obvious to anyone attending the film. The cast is impressive and is headlined by megastar Tom Hanks French beauty Audrey Tautou (Amelie) and respected British thespian (and everyones favorite mutant or wizard) Ian McKellan. All do the best jobs they can with paper-thin characters. No one is given much of an opportunity to stand out. Paul Bettany brings a little menace to his role as the most visible bad guy but hes never truly frightening. In fact there are times when Jean Reno is more intimidating. The chemistry between Hanks and Tautou is lukewarm at best. If theres anything other than mild affection between them it doesnt make it across. The Da Vinci Code is ultimately too plot-heavy to allow much in the way of character development and that means its not an actors feature. Hanks is familiar Tautou is lovely and McKellan is eloquent - and thats all they have to be. The prosaic story does not warrant the films epic length. Two-and-one-half hour movies are supposed to be something special. This one is merely overlong. I cant help but wonder whether a shorter sharper cut of The Da Vinci Code might have resulted in a more suspenseful production. The muddled ending is part of the problem but so is the ""treasure hunt"" aspect of the journey. It becomes tedious when breaking a code or solving a puzzle merely uncovers another puzzle or code. After a while this pattern becomes tiresome. Maybe its fun to ""play along"" with characters in a book but the movie experience isnt engaging. At least The Da Vinci Code is better in this respect than National Treasure. In terms of its appeal The Da Vinci Code isnt appreciably better or worse than its two summer 2006 big-budget predecessors Mission Impossible III and Poseidon (although it will likely score a higher total at the box office than either). Like those earlier releases its a relatively mindless affair that offers adequate entertainment value while displaying obvious and often irritating flaws. The controversy has made seeing The Da Vinci Code a more desirable night out than it might otherwise have been but it wont take long before potential audience members recognize that the Emperor has no clothes. One could classify The Da Vinci Code as diverting but it has sidestepped greatness by a wide margin.

And as it turns out not a good one -- turgid and pompous lacking suspense or any mitigating wit. As a book Dan Browns global blockbuster The Da Vinci Code was a gripping riddler tricked out with provocative theology which you could swallow whole or spit out with a grimace depending on your mood. But in the film The Da Vinci Codes addictive narrative slows to a grind. Absent is the pure guilty joy of sequential puzzle-solving; instead of participating in the hunt were shoved off to the side as a couple of crashing boors do it for us. Sitting through this overlong overbaked overbearing anti-thriller felt like watching a team of academics solve cryptograms for two and a half hours straight. The major plot points are all there conveyed with dutiful gas-bag literalism by sturdy auteur Ron Howard. Early on Tom Hanks -- as a code-cracking Harvard scholar called to the scene of a murdered Louvre curator -- delivers a talk on the history of religious symbolism but the whole film might have been shot in a lecture hall. It has the cough-syrupy didacticism of delivered truth. Open wide here it comes the Big Buried Secret that the Catholic Church has covered up for millenniums waging war against it murdering for it employing self-flagellating Opus Dei albino monks to retrieve and destroy it in its ancient hidey-hole. Although nine-tenths of literate humanity have read the book or its offshoots and know the nature of this big buried secret Im going to assume you dont I will not reveal the scandalous hidden revelation of Jesus life. Judging from all the outraged calls for boycott it is scandalous. The revelation part I cant address though the weight it places on ""suppressed"" Gnostic gospels (studied for centuries now available online) seems a touch wacky. Is it really as one character calls it ""the greatest cover-up in human history""? Sounds like somebody never watched Quiz Show. Howard and his cast (Hanks plus Audrey Tautou as the curators granddaughter Alfred Molina as a conspiring bishop and Paul Bettany as the flesh-mortifying monk whose Dracula accent has a nice whiff of cheese) bring to this quest for truthiness a prune-faced solemnity drained of all fun. Hanks reads lines as though theyve been pasted on his tongue straight from Akiva Goldsmans script which leaves out most of the books icky preoccupation with pagan sex rites but otherwise drags. A few of the films visual gimmicks look cribbed from a much finer Howard Goldsman film about code-breaking A Beautiful Mind. And Hans Zimmers score lays it on thick with hacksawed string motifs and choral swells swiped from Carmina Burana coincidentally (or intentionally?) based on the writings of randy monks. The only one having a high old time is Ian McKellen who plays an obsessed Knights Templar scholar with such smashing enthusiasm youll wish he could fill every role. Hes the only who one seems to grasp hes in a movie -- not a college syllabus not an unearthed Vatican directive not a founding tenet for some radical new church. A movie. But by all means boycott it Youll sleep better at home. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Mini Portable Washer and Spin Dryer for 90 + free shipping Unisex Cushioned Arch Supports for 1 + free shipping Vizio 43"" 4K LED UHD Smart TV 150 Dell GC for 400 + free...

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Not so dark the con of man after all. When Louvre curator Jacques Sauniere scrawled the heavy caveat ""so dark the con of man"" on the face of Leonardo Da Vincis ""Mona Lisa"" he left an anagram clue for cryptologist Sophie Neveu and Harvard professor of symbology Robert Langdon about the aims and affiliation of his murderer. With Ron Howards version of ""The Da Vinci Code"" hitting thousands of screens today Saunieres warning suggests a different sort of conspiracy - hardly holy but wholly familiar. Beware the strange confluence of marketing and media coverage pushed along by ax-grinders hoping for a whetstone. By weekends end - if quality determines rancor - the gatherings of some Christian soldiers aching for a pop-culture battle will disband. The film is nowhere near as history-tweaking or controversial as Dan Browns novel. And its not as commanding of respect and comment as Mel Gibsons ""The Passion of the Christ"" or even ""The Chronicles of Narnia."" Theres nothing particularly sacred - feminine or otherwise - at stake with Howards awkward version which opened the Cannes Film Festival earlier this week. Its hard to issue a spoiler alert for a film based on a novel with 50 million copies circulating. Yet for you blessed laggards - I was one until last week - Ill tread carefully. If you havent read the book - if youve avoided the run-up to the movie - you are one of the few filmgoers with a shot at experiencing the movie in a way that might be satisfying. And even then. Tom Hanks stars as Langdon an internationally regarded scholar on a book tour in Paris with his latest tome ""Symbols of the Lost Sacred Feminine."" Langdon becomes a prime suspect when the dying curator scribbled his name on the floor of the famed Paris museum. French actress Audrey Tautou (""Amelie"" and ""Dirty Pretty Things"") plays Sophie Saunieres estranged granddaughter. Like Da Vinci Sir Isaac Newton and Botticelli the curator was a member of the clandestine Priory of Sion an organization charged with keeping the secrets of the Holy Grail and the truth of Jesus Christs life which is... Virgins avert your eyes That Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene. That the Holy Grail refers to Magdalene and the fruit of her womb. That in consolidating its power the Catholic Church savagely suppressed those facts. That the Knights Templar and the Priory made it their business (financially and morally) to safeguard the evidence of the churchs massive and ongoing cover-up. OK you can open your eyes. Sauniere was the fourth and the highest-ranking member of the Priory to be murdered by a determined monk named Silas. Once an outcast because he is albino Silas (Paul Bettany) found a calling and a patron in a young Spanish priest named Aringarosa. Now a bishop and Opus Dei honcho Aringarosa (Alfred Molina) has loaned Silas out to a man known only as the Teacher. The novel maintained a palpable tension between the police captain Bezu Fache and the mysterious Teacher. Were they one and the same? It may have been an obvious trick but Brown sustained it well. Until the end the reader could be nagged by the question of why the chief investigator is so focused on Langdon and Neveu as suspects. In the novel Fache was called the Bull by his underlings. The way Akiva Goldsman has rewritten Jean Renos character steer is more like it. This is one instance among many where the filmmakers jettisoned one of the novels dramatic tensions but never came up with a competing one. From the moment they are united by Saunieres message Langdon and Nevue are on the lam as well as a quest. This intrigue of pursuit while in flight works on paper but stumbles onscreen. Langdon and Nevue escape the Louvre and head to a Swiss bank where the ""keystone"" to the Grail resides. They then escape to Sir Leigh Teabings security-gated doorstep. The knight played by Sir Ian McKellen is an expert on the competing histories and mysteries of the Grail the Knights Templar and the Priory. Thank heaven for McKellens gift for enuciation. ""The Da Vinci Code"" often feels like the chattiest movie this side of ""My Dinner With Andre"" and Teabing is in charge of much of the movies exposition. But Mc- Kellen brings energy to his role which is more than the leads do. Langdon and Neveu seldom appear endangered. Theyre too busy making sure we understand their brainy scavenger hunt. When the Teacher brandishes a gun at Sophies head near Newtons tomb the situations gravity seems lost on Langdon. Hanks performance is a bigger mystery than anything Sauniere teased us with. Not until the films end does the actor deliver anything approaching his talent. His monologue on belief and faith is the only sustained moment of writing - and acting - in the film. The confounding thing about ""The Da Vinci Code"" is that while the film runs nearly 2 1/2 hours it seems hurried. In a marketplace rife with guides for idiots dummies and the rest of us this movie stands as the novels priciest CliffsNotes.

"Painted into a corner - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Painted into a corner By sticking faithfully to the novel The Da Vinci Code never comes to life By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  May 19 2006 And now the circus goes quiet. In the hush under the spotlight after 40 days and 40 nights of manufactured hype and impassioned controversy (or is it the other way around?) stands a small surprisingly ordinary movie. As a film derived from a book The Da Vinci Code"" isnt a fiasco on the order of The Bonfire of the Vanities"" nor is it a triumph a la The Lord of the Rings."" Instead its an acceptable but uninspired simulacrum an overly faithful multiplex translation of a very very popular airport novel.The Hollywood alchemists havent turned gold to lead. Theyve turned copper to zinc.Ron Howard it turns out was precisely the wrong person to bring Dan Browns best-selling novel to the screen. This project needed a risk-taker and a stylist someone who could transmute a book that alternates routine action scenes with art-history lectures into riveting cinema. Howards a good studio soldier though and with his house screenwriter Akiva Goldsman he has delivered a Da Vinci Code"" thats chained timidly to its source. If youve read the book itll seem like a dutiful pilgrims tour of the salient plot points Here we are at the Louvre now we go to the Bank of Zurich whoops Jesus had a home life. If you havent read the book you may wonder what all the noise was about.Hows Tom Hankss hair? Fine fine; its a wardrobe affectation but you get over it after the first few scenes. The real problem facing our Tom is that he doesnt have a character to play. Robert Langdon Harvard professor of symbology and dashing doubting Thomas functions as a mouthpiece for Browns wild and woolly Christian conspiracy theories and where its easy for a reader to project three-dimensionality onto the character on the page Hanks is left holding the bag onscreen.As the audiences surrogate American in Paris Langdon has to declaim silly lines of exposition such as This is the Bois de Boulogne?"" or expound at length on the secrets of Leonardo da Vinci and the shadowy Priory of Sion to Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) the fetching French cryptographer who gets swept up in the mystery. Hanks never breaks through the thick webbing of plot to create a viable human being though; this may be his most constipated least Hanksian performance ever.Nor does Tautou the wonky free spirit of Amelie"" fare any better. Sophie is stuck asking breathless questions so Langdon can give his discourses; she also occasionally cranks up the suspense by urgently whispering We must find anozzer way"" Dont expect romance between these two either. Langdons admiring Ive never met a girl who knew that much about a cryptex"" is the closest he gets to sweet nothings. To recap for the uninitiated Jacques Sauniere (Jean-Pierre Marielle) an aging curator at the Louvre is found murdered in one of the museum galleries his nude body grotesquely posed and arcane messages written around him in ultraviolet pen. The detective on the case Bezu Fache (who else but Jean Reno?) brings Langdon to the crime scene for consultation and grilling since all clues point to the professor. With the aid of Neveu Saunieres granddaughter Langdon escapes and the two are off on a merry chase across both France and centuries of Church secrets.WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE DA VINCI CODE""? Share your opinions at www.boston.com/films.Sauniere it seems was the grandmaster of a hidden order called the Priory of Sion which holds the true secret of the Holy Grail. Da Vinci was in on the mystery as was Isaac Newton as was apparently the entire supporting cast of Eyes Wide Shut."" Without giving anything away to newcomers it involves the relationship of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene the Divine Goddess and lots of historical flashbacks that look like colorized outtakes from old Cecil B. DeMille epics.Does the Church like this? Not at all which is why a rogue bishop (Alfred Molina) in the conservative Catholic sect Opus Dei has sent his albino right-hand monk Silas (Paul Bettany) to murder the Priory members and find the location of the Grail. In turn both bishop and disciple are being used by an enigmatic Teacher.More than half the fun of the novel lay in the puzzles of course anagrams and riddles and keystones hints buried in famous paintings that divulged the next step of the treasure hunt while allowing Dan Brown to indulge in miniature Leonardo for Dummies"" crash courses. This was literature as computer game but the movie treats it as scripture and nearly bleeds the zing out of it.When the fugitives arrive at the palatial estate of Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen) an airy British Grail expert The Da Vinci Code"" temporarily gets the lift it needs. McKellen alone understands the inherent pulp silliness of the material and when he introduces the existence of the Gospel of Philip he could just as well be talking about the Gospel of Bob.Eventually hes chewed up in the plot mechanics though; as in the book once the Big Secret has been aired theres nothing to do but fall back on lazy thriller cliches up to and including lurking butlers. The movie does pick up anew after McKellen is offscreen and in the final 15 minutes you can feel Howard rousing himself to care. Hans Zimmers functional suspense score turns lyrical the images mist up and the script delivers sentiments along the lines of Why does it have to be human and divine? Maybe human is divine."" The devout may take this as just the latest installment of Hollywood secularism while others may write it off as watered-down Beverly Hills Buddhism. But at least it feels felt.Anyway theres enough for the faithful to get their knickers in a twist over if they choose to. The reason The Da Vinci Code"" has been a publishing phenomenon though is only partly because of its perceived heresies. Is [all this] possible?"" asks Sophie at one point to which Robert responds Its not impossible"" and in that gulf lives our abiding love of conspiracy theories -- our sense that weve been lied to but that the Truth is in the patterns if were just smart enough to see it. Brown has merely added the Son of God to the JFK assassination and Area 51 as subjects for endless pop cryptography.All right conservative Catholics dont come off well here but neither do misguided atheists for that matter. The scenes where Silas indulges in his gentle hobby of ritual mortification are played for horror-movie gruesomeness but maybe the filmmakers can be excused for thinking this sort of thing packs the house after the success of The Passion of the Christ.""The greater sin in The Da Vinci Code"" is against storytelling The movie is handsome and hogtied and dour as a parson. In its defense it does make manifest the pleasures of a good book. In the films goofiest line of dialogue Hanks turns to Tautou and exclaims Ive got to get to a library -- fast.""Lord dont we all.

"No Masterpiece Here washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies No Masterpiece Here Whats up? Tom Hanks is symbologist Robert Langdon and Audrey Tautou is cryptologist Sophie Neveu in ""The Da Vinci Code."" (By Simon Mein -- Sony Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday May 19 2006 The movie Sony Pictures has been desperately trying to position as ""the most controversial thriller of the year"" turns out to be about as thrilling as watching your parents do a Sudoku puzzle. ""The Da Vinci Code"" Ron Howards hotly anticipated adaptation of Dan Browns phenom of a bestseller plays it so safe and on-the-nose that any high emotion engendered by its provocative premise is quickly squelched. In Howards methodical hands Browns story of a frantic pre-dawn multi-country search for the Holy Grail unfolds not as a pulse-quickening action-adventure film laced with theological intrigue but a surprisingly bland procedural with a particularly well-pedigreed MacGuffin. Tom Hanks looks startlingly pasty and impassive as the storys protagonist dashing Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon who is inexplicably summoned to the Louvre while at a book-signing in Paris. There he is confronted with the corpse of an elderly man who has carved a pentacle on his chest and who has scrawled a series of anagrams and numerical puzzles to help identify not his killer but what his killer was trying to find. Langdon is soon joined by a pretty cryptologist named Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) who has her own professional and personal interest in the case; together they embark on a journey from Paris to its outskirts to London and finally Scotland in what turns out to be a scavenger hunt of historical even metaphysical proportions. But most filmgoers probably know all this because most of them have probably read ""The Da Vinci Code"" a starchily written potboiler that despite its graceless prose and turgid expository digressions has sold more than 40 million copies. Fans of the book will understandably be curious to see how it fares on the big screen; this is a book so movie-ready that it needed only a few ""Fade Ins"" and ""Fade Outs"" to qualify as a shooting script. If Howards ""Da Vinci Code"" doesnt take the story in any radical new directions (no one will object to the understandable cuts he has made in narrative and characters) he delivers what the books admirers presumably want a live-action illustration of the story theyve had in their heads for three years. He does that with perhaps a surfeit of sobriety and taste and it looks like hes tried to soothe some of the misgivings Christian groups have expressed about Browns questioning of Jesus Christs divinity. Unlike the book in this ""Da Vinci Code"" Langdon throws in lots of interjections reminding viewers that this is all just speculation; and by the films final couple of twists the filmmakers have made an earnest case for faith. Even the films putative baddie an albino named Silas (Paul Bettany) a member of the Opus Dei organization comes to be seen as more of a dupe than an out-and-out villain. Bettanys sympathetic performance in a thankless role is one of the best in the film as is that of Ian McKellen who delivers a crafty turn as an obsessive Grail hunter. While Hanks and Tautou sleepwalk through their performances McKellen provides a much-needed spark of mischief. (One quibble many readers will have with Howards adaptation is how he has made Neveu -- who in the book is just as intellectually adroit as her male counterpart -- into little more than a doe-eyed odalisque. Its a particularly ironic choice for a story that is predicated on the feminist premise that not just Eve but Mary Magdalene and countless women after her were framed.) Having endured the wrath of Cannes this week ""The Da Vinci Code"" is already being buzzed about as possessing what might be the most risible Big Reveal in recent memory if not cinema history; with its preposterous punch line and the awkward silence that follows its a moment that begs for an ""Im Going to Disney World"" A touch of playfulness wouldnt have hurt ""The Da Vinci Code"" which far from being the super-serious drama its critics have anticipated is a relatively formulaic quest adventure in the tradition of ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Matrix"" both of whose philosophical underpinnings provide interesting food for thought rather than earth-shattering doctrinal pronouncements. Indeed if Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman (""A Beautiful Mind"") had only seen the potential for some intellectually subversive fun in ""The Da Vinci Code"" the movie could have been a taut unusually smart thriller. Whats more by dispensing with a few painterly flashbacks and windy academic speeches it just might have bucked the current trend in Hollywood and clocked in at under two hours. Now theres a Grail. The Da Vinci Code (149 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for disturbing images violence some nudity thematic material brief drug references and sexual content.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Oh Jesus How Ron Howard desecrated The Da Vinci Code while the X-Men franchise survived Brett Ratner. By David Edelstein Published ShareThis Illustration by Wes Duvall  (Photo Simon Mein/Courtesy of Sony Pictures) Dan Browns pointy-headed potboiler The Da Vinci Code might actually be the threat to Christianity that its critics claim but there are many threats out thereamong them works by Deist scholars that speculate authoritatively on the multiple human authors and extra-divine political intentions of the New (and for that matter Old) Testament. Where Brown ups the ante is in spinning a matriarchal counter-theology that borders on pagan goddess-worship and in making the reactionary-Catholic Opus Dei sect a bastion of homicidal zealots. Throw in car chases gory murders skulking bishops a mysterious criminal mastermind a self-flagellating killer albino papyri in booby-trapped vials and cryptogrammatic clues in masterpieces of Western art and youve got yourself a publishing phenomenon that even a lot of churchgoers cant resist. The divinely uninspired adaptation by director Ron Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman makes little of all this The movie is a Shaggy Grail story without a whisper of passionnot even the passion for intellectual gamesmanship that buttressed the glop in the pairs A Beautiful Mind. Given the furor surrounding its opening The Da Vinci Code is an embarrassing nonevent. You can imagine Catholic leaders emerging from cinemas and telling their picketers to go home. For a start (and a finish) Browns subversive thrust has been softened. In the book its presented as fact that Jesus wasnt divine He was merely a major prophet until the emperor Constantine came along in the fourth century andto shore up his own powerreorchestrated the religion around the whole Son of God thing. In the film thats just a theoryand more important a theory disputed by the nice-guy hero and famed symbologist Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks). To clinch the deal its proponent is an eccentric semi-invalid called Sir Leigh Teabing a sodomite moniker if ever there was one and played by an extra-fruity Sir Ian McKellen. Now really Whose side would you be on? After an Opus Dei bishop (Alfred Molina) fingers Langdon for the murder of a Louvre curator the symbologist and the French police cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) follow the dead heretics fancy clues in search of a secret that could transform the modern world. Their trek should at least produce some juicy set-pieces Think what a haunted Catholic like Alfred Hitchcock would have made of this material. But Goldsman brings nothingnot even shameless Hollywood religiosityto the party. Was the screenwriter so worried hed be the target of anti-Semitic fusillades that he kept The Da Vinci Code at arms length? Maybe the job should have gone to a Catholic writer who would have identified with and preserved Browns wise-ass-altar-boy tone because without it theres nothing left except generic thriller devices and a director too timid to give those a charge. Howard cant even make something of what should have been a breathtaking murder scene the Louvre at night. He blurs the backgrounds. I felt sympathy for Hanks. This is obviously a money job but its probably no fun for an actor with his smarts when theres nothing to playno subtext no strong objective and no characters of stature to go up against. Hes upstaged by his suit (a trim charcoal number). Pretty though she is Audrey Tautou is a bigger washout. A textbook gamine (the text being Amelie) she seems bred for airy enchantment not earthy gumption and her very approximate English turns even rudimentary dialogue into a linguistic adventure. She was obviously cast because the script said French girl and the studio execs said Call Tautous agentthe way the script said French cap-i-tain and the execs said Call the Godzilla guys agent Jean Reno. Another bad call was casting the pale blond Englishman Paul Bettany as the demented albino Silas. Hes a fine actor but hes slender and diffident; he has to work too hard to convey the volcanic inner life thats meant as a counterpoint to the abominable-snowman exterior. If theres anything to be learned from this dud its that when you adapt an explosive property like The Da Vinci Code playing it safe isnt safe Either swallow hard and make the damnable thing or give it to someone with more guts and/or less to lose. Here is a saga that bombards the very foundations of Western religion. But onscreen there seems to be absolutely nothing at stake. 1 2 Next Share this story...

"The Da Vinci Code reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Da Vinci Code reviewed. The Da Vinci Code reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 18 2006 624 PM Worse Than the Book A fruitless search for fun in The Da Vinci Code. By Dana Stevens Tom Hanks in The Da Vinci Code As I slogged through the vast wastes of expository dialogue that comprise Dan Browns best seller The Da Vinci Code one of the few compliments I could honestly pay the book was that it was eminently filmable. Its dense labyrinthine story line is propelled not by language but by images a naked corpse splayed on the floor of the Louvre; a car chase around Paris in a minuscule SmartCar; a giant self-flagellating albino monk. So movie-ready is The Da Vinci Code that Random House has even put out an illustrated edition of the novel featuring photos of the works of art and architecture that propel the thrillers plot. I found reading The Da Vinci Code something of a trial--to paraphrase Mark Twain Once you put it down you cant pick it up--but at least I told myself itll make a swell movie. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. So much for that theory. Ron Howard a maker of glossy populist entertainments (Splash Apollo 13 A Beautiful Mind) interspersed with the odd pointless clunker (How the Grinch Stole Christmas) has squandered an opportunity to treat us to a big dumb summer movie that could have combined the occult frisson of The Exorcist with the paranoid energy of All the Presidents Men. Given the silliness of the source material The Da Vinci Code stood little chance of being a great film but it could easily have been a fun one. Instead Howard takes a strangely respectful approach to the overheated mysticism of the novel turning the film into that most boring of genres the pious blockbuster. Advertisement For the 12 people in the country who havent already read it Ill summarize the plot Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) a professor of religious symbology at Harvard is summoned to examine the body of a French curator Jacques Sauniere (Jean-Pierre Marielle) whos been found naked and dead in the Louvre a five-sided star drawn on his chest in blood. With the arrival on the scene of a foxy French cryptographer named Sophie (Audrey Tautou) Langdon is soon caught up in a web of utterly incomprehensible international intrigue. Chased by a cranky French cop (Jean Reno) Langdon and Sophie take refuge in the home of Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen) an eccentric and mysteriously wealthy scholar of all things occult. When the aforementioned albino monk (an unrecognizable Paul Bettany) shows up with a gun its time to hop Sir Leighs private jet to England yammering all the while about the Knights Templar the Holy Grail and the placement of the figures in Da Vincis Last Supper. What does it all mean? Without risking any spoilers I can tell you this much An underground gnostic sect has spent the last 2000 years guarding an unspeakable secret a secret with the power to shake civilization in its very boots. And that secret against all reason involves the messiah and Audrey Tautou. To my mind the most ineffable gnostic secret of all is how such hooey has managed to capture the imagination of tens of millions of people all around the world. My best guess is that the books success has to do with its timing Beset by faceless enemies and engaged in endlesswars perhaps we need the comforting certainty of the occult. The message at the heart of this storysparanoid labyrinth is ostensibly an anti-clerical one Jesus is no god but only a man and the Catholic Church is little more than a transhistorical Cosa Nostra dedicated to covering up that fact. But despite its purported iconoclasm The Da Vinci Code is at heart deeply religious and monotheistic at that It wants us to believe that there is one secret truth that can change history that that truth is knowable and that only through Tom Hanks can we know it. Our salvation depends on Forrest Gump. Its too bad then that just as he did in How the Grinch Stole Christmas Ron Howard shoots himself in the foot by muting the charm of his own leading man. What director in his right mind would hire Jim Carrey only to immobilize his notoriously flexible face under 10 pounds of foam rubber? The same one who would dissuade Tom Hanks from doing That Thing He Does the wry self-effacement shtick that has become his trademark. Hanks Langdon has no quirks no context no history Hes a neutral container for information a Grail-hunting bore. Shouldnt the meeting of a Harvard symbologist and a decipherer of codes for the Paris police be a nerd orgy with the two brainiacs bonding over their shared love for anagrams? Instead Hanks and Tautou mope sexlessly in dusty medieval churches recalling their traumatic pasts in grainy flashbacks (a car accident for her a fall down a well for him). The knowledge they seek may be ineffable but these characters back stories are as effable as they come. As Rosemarys Baby proved deciphering anagrams from the beyond is not inherently uncinematic and theres no reason a goofy pulp novel cant be turned into a scary sexy film. The Da Vinci Code is neither--unless of course every line of dialogue in the film is an anagram for another better one. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Ron Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman struggle mightily to cram as much as possible of Dan Browns labyrinthine thriller into a 2-hour-28-minute running time resulting in a movie both overstuffed and underwhelming. This film is not likely to topple Christianity as we know it though it could do serious damage to Audrey Tautous hopes of a Hollywood career.Tautou plays Paris police cyryptologist Sophie Neveu whose grandfather a curator at the Louvre is murdered at the beginning of ""The Da Vinci Code."" As readers of Browns spectacularly successful novel know before he dies the victim Jacques Sauniere leaves behind a set of riddles and clues. He also selects the only two people in the world capable of unraveling them Sophie and Harvard ""symbologist"" Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks). Unfortunately for Langdon the French cop in charge of the investigation Bezu Fache (Jean Reno) is convinced hes the killer. And so the chase begins Robert and Sophie trying to stay one step ahead of the law--and the murderous Opus Dei albino monk (Paul Bettany)--as they pursue a mystery that could upset the very foundations of Christianity. (Is there anyone reading who doesnt know all this already or what the big revelation about Jesus and Mary Magdalene is? Still out of deference for those unenlightened few I will reveal no more.)Browns paragraphs alternate between pulpy cliffhangers and barely digested research giving the reader a crash course in early Christian theology pagan symbolism religious-art history and the relationship between the Knights Templar and the papacy with side essays on codebreaking and cryptology. The question about the movie was how could you fit all this exposition into a mile-a-minute thriller without bringing everything to a crashing didactic halt? Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week The answer awkwardly. One solution is the historical flashback. Periodically Howard speeds us off to crowded computer-generated visions of ancient Rome or the Holy Land or Ye Olde England for whirlwind history lessons that whip by so speedily you can barely take in the information but not fast enough so that you dont notice how tacky they look. Then there are the desaturated-color flashbacks to traumatic moments in our characters histories little Robert falling down a well the car crash that kills Sophies parents or the back story of Silas the albino hit man with a penchant for self-flagellation. Anyone who hasnt read the book will find this latter utterly confounding as will anyone who has.What works considerably better is the arrival of Sir Ian McKellan as the crippled English Holy Grail scholar Sir Leigh Teabing who gives us a helpful slideshow ferreting out the secrets of Da Vincis ""Last Supper."" McKellan arrives midway through the thriller by which time it desperately needs his mischievous over-the-top energy.""Da Vinci Code"" isnt boring but its surprisingly unfun. Brown put all his ingenuity into his treasure-hunt riddles. Since these are dispatched with quickly in the movie version we are left with what passes for ""characters"" and lets face it Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu are a pretty glum pair of sleuths. The movie is so anxious about covering as much of the novels ground as possible that it never gives the actors any breathing space. Even an actor as clever and likeable as Hanks can do little with the Harvard prof. Langdons decoding powers here seem almost superhuman (the words in the various riddles literally light up on screen as he unscrambles an anagram not unlike the visions of John Nash in the Howard-Goldsman ""A Beautiful Mind""). But who is this guy? Sophie Neveus contributions as a cryptologist have been diminished in the screen version. Shes been dumbed-down but not warmed-up or fleshed-out and Tautou whose accent is not always easy to decipher looks ill at ease. Howard allows her none of the spark she demonstrated in ""Amelie"" or ""Dirty Pretty Things."" Hanks and Tautou dont even seem to be trying for chemistry.The bare bones of Browns thriller--the chases and hairs-breadth escapes--were always the most rickety elements of the novel. The movie exposes just how threadbare they are. (A flock of birds distracting a killer from shooting our heroes? Some of the escapes here would barely pass muster in a silent-movie serial.) Over the years Howard has proven a director of great versatility from ""Splash"" to ""Apollo 13"" but ""The Da Vinci Code"" doesnt play to his strengths to say the least. Hes always been good at bringing out the humanity of his characters but what is there to bring out in the bug-eyed albino Silas a villain so improbable he makes an actor as good as Paul Bettany look hapless? ""The Da Vinci Code"" is handsome expensive-looking and filled with impressive castles churches chateaus and museums. It even has a few provocative theories about history. The only thing missing is actual human beings.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

I realize that for many devout Christians and others - albinos reportedly are none too pleased - asking this question is a bit like the old joke ""Aside from that Mrs. Lincoln how did you enjoy the play?""But it is worth bearing in mind that ""The Da Vinci Code"" is based on a work of fiction and that the movie is in the end a movie. Trying to extract a theology lesson from this film makes about as much sense as watching Oliver Stones ""JFK"" to learn the truth about the Kennedy assassination. Unlike Stones movie ""The Da Vinci Code"" is so transparently pitched as pulp entertainment that in the end its about as subversive as ""Starsky and Hutch.""If you are one of the 40 million people who has read Dan Browns mega-bestseller or even read about it in the approximately 40 million articles that have recently come out about it you know that the plot centers on the reputed mortality of Jesus and the continuance of his bloodline. Since you may not be one of those 40 million Ill keep any further divulgences to a minimum except to say that if you havent read the book youre in for a lot of head-scratching. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Browns 489-page tome reads like a bloated movie treatment and the overly long movie directed by Ron Howard and written by Akiva Goldsman hews fairly closely to the book. Tom Hanks plays professor Robert Langdon famed Harvard symbologist who is drawn into a criminal investigation while in Paris to promote his new book. A curator at the Louvre has been murdered and Robert finds himself the prime suspect. Joining him on the run is the curators estranged granddaughter Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) a police cryptologist. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Together without so much as a hearty hand clasp they scamper across a fair amount of French and English acreage in search of exoneration and the secret hiding place of the Holy Grail. In its barest outline the movie has a Hitchcockian premise An innocent man is mistakenly fingered for a crime he didnt commit. The pseudo-religious overlay is essentially window dressing a way of being fashionably scandalous.The filmmakers dont waste much time getting down to business. Not 20 minutes into the movie were treated to the sight of the albino monk assassin Silas (Paul Bettany) mortifying his flesh in bloody close-up. Silas is supposed to be terrifyingly wraithlike but the role is closer to camp or Kabuki. With the glorious exception of Ian McKellen who plays the Grail expert Sir Leigh Teabing with cranky panache the rest of the cast is dull. That includes Jean Reno as a French police captain and Alfred Molina as a bishop in the Catholic sect Opus Dei.Hanks never cracks a smile as if to do so would expose the shallowness of the material. In what is perhaps a sop to the books critics Robert has been made more disputatious and spiritually inclined. Tautou who is given little to do but look pretty is colorless.In the book both Sophie and Robert are constantly exercising their wits in order to solve a series of cryptographic puzzles. In the movie the puzzle-solving is kept to a minimum. What this means is that the film lacks the deductive appeal of the book - the way it compelled you to match wits with the protagonists.Instead what might have been a cerebral treasure hunt bogs down in a miasma of nonstop exposition. To fill in the commentary we are subjected to repeated flashbacks of the Biblical past that look as if they were culled from bleached out black-and-white snippets from The History Channel or early Cecil B. DeMille. You can tell that Howard is more comfortable with action sequences because every time theres a shootout the film gets an instant adrenaline boost.I suppose there was never any doubt that Dan Browns book would be snapped up by Hollywood but not all bestsellers are cut out to be movies. Howards film isnt terrible but if the book had never existed Im not sure people would be knocking down the barricades to see this movie. They probably wont be knocking them down anyway.

CR Simon Mein Photo Simon Mein Image 2 of 2 - - Photo Simon Mein For Da Vinci the thrill is gone 1 / 2 Back to Gallery The Da Vinci Code Thriller. Starring Tom Hanks Audrey Tautou Jean Reno and Ian McKellen. Directed by Ron Howard. (PG-13. 153 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The Da Vinci Code"" the film version of Dan Browns enormous best-seller should have been the thinking persons thrill ride. Just looked at as a piece of story construction the movies plot is a thing of beauty with some immediate danger always pressing in on the characters and some gigantic riddle always in the process of revealing itself. There are reversals of expectation miraculous escapes from certain doom -- all the things that make thrillers thrilling. But ""The Da Vinci Code"" isnt thrilling. Its not a complete dud either. Though its tempting to deal in extremes when talking about the years most anticipated picture the truth is that ""The Da Vinci Code"" is a pretty-good-but-who-cares effort a moderately interesting diversion that will hold audiences in the moment but leave them unmoved and unchanged. For a routine entry that wouldnt be bad but for a 153-minute blockbuster directed by Ron Howard and written by Akiva Goldsman (""A Beautiful Mind"") theres no pretending it lives up to expectations. Actually it may in part have been audience expectations that dragged this one down. Its safe to say that with a book this well known any straying from the source material risks audience rejection and yet dialogue that works on a printed page doesnt necessarily work onscreen. There are entire sequences in ""The Da Vinci Code"" that should have been riveting but instead are so weighted down in talk that they seem slow -- not thoughtful not rich with detail not generously full of texture but slow in a way that undercuts the flow. Of course in each case some spoonful of action comes along to help the medicine go down but the dialogue shouldnt have been like medicine by turns didactic abstruse and melodramatic. Instead of lurching back to life every other scene ""The Da Vinci Code"" should have built from one episode to the next. Things go right for about 15 minutes. A museum curator is killed in the Louvre and the French authorities -- in the stern form of a police captain (Jean Reno) -- bring in Langdon (Tom Hanks) an American symbologist to look at symbols the corpse painted on himself (with blood) before he died. No sooner has Langdon begun examining these symbols than a police cryptologist Sophie (Audrey Tautou) shows up to sneak a message to Langdon He is in danger. The captain is about to arrest him and throw away the key. He has to escape. From there the movie plunges into the time-honored and effective thriller situation in which an innocent man and a female companion try to discover the real criminals while running from the police. In ""The Da Vinci Code"" this classic setup is complicated and enhanced by the fact that Langdon begins to unravel a 2000-year-old secret. This puts him in danger not only from the police but also from two mysterious societies one of which has a lunatic albino monk (Paul Bettany) going around killing people. Give credit to Bettany for a gutsy performance. After seeing him half nude and flagellating himself itll take a while for audiences to buy him as a romantic lead. If only for the lack of opportunities no one wants to get typecast playing lunatic albino monks. It says something that in terms of flashiness Bettanys performance is a distant second to that of Ian McKellen who plays Sir Leigh an expert on the history of the Holy Grail. Walking with two canes (hed have walked with three if he could) twinkly and wise one minute and then raving the next McKellen exudes the joy of playing a theatrical character. He needs all the panache at his disposal in that he has the burden of much of the exposition. The movie needs McKellen. When hes offscreen the audience is left with Hanks and Tautou playing essentially reactive characters. Though its built into the storys design that no compelling personal dynamic develops between the two main characters a difference in energy at least might have helped. Here both Hanks and Tautou are dark earnest and a little bit dull -- and they remain earnest and dull. Audiences tend to measure the grandeur of the story by noting its effect on the protagonist. Perhaps thats why for all the Paris and London locations for all the grainy flashbacks to medieval times for all the insistence of the soundtrack one comes away from ""The Da Vinci Code"" feeling that whatever happened it didnt add up to much. -- Advisory Graphic violence threatening situations and Paul Bettany almost naked.

What emerges is a melodramatic sometimes lifeless film that is missing the suspense of the popular novel. Though it retains most of the complex twists and turns of Dan Browns best seller some of the elements that have sparked protests among Christians -- questions about the divinity of Jesus Christ and his lineage -- have had their edges smoothed. It doesnt help that the pacing is weighed down in exposition and talkiness. Where the movie deviates from the book most strikingly is in the attitude of the lead character Harvard symbology professor Robert Langdon (a surprisingly wooden Tom Hanks in a new longer coif). The movie tones down his academic fervor and ratchets up his spirituality. In the book he does not discuss prayer. In the movie he does. The movie also avoids the books graphic depiction of a sex rite. Co-star Audrey Tautou so engaging in Amelie comes across as a cipher. The supporting players are the greatest assets namely Jean Reno as Bezu Fache an overzealous French police chief; Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing an eminent historian; and Paul Bettany as Silas a frighteningly devout monk affiliated with the conservative Catholic sect Opus Dei. The script additions are pedestrian and unintentionally comical. In the midst of searching for clues Langdon announces ""I need a library. Fast"" Perhaps the movies most grating element is its overheated and intrusive score by Hans Zimmer. The story opens with the murder of a famous museum curator inside the Louvre. French police summon Langdon to the scene. Police cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Tautou) and Langdon piece together a treasure-trove of clues and puzzle pieces in Da Vinci paintings that lead to the discovery of a religious mystery protected by a secret society for 2000 years. The mystery is so shocking it could shake the foundations of Christianity. The Da Vinci Code phenomenon has spawned a cottage industry. Bookstore displays are rife with scholarly treatises on the controversial subject of Jesus and his supposed relationship with Mary Magdalene as well as spinoffs by pop culture writers. Theres even a Da Vinci diet book. So its no surprise that Hollywood jumped into the fray. Browns novel even reads like a screenplay. More thumbs down than up Of 48 Da Vinci Code reviews at RottenTomatoes.com 40 are negative. Sample reviews Jami Bernard New York Daily News ""The religious sect that recently advised parishioners to fast unto death to protest The Da Vinci Code can start eating again. This Code isnt all its cracked up to be."" U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops ""Dan Browns record-breaking best seller comes to the screen with most of its spurious historical artistic and theological misstatements intact. The underlying assertions and the obvious falsehoods about Opus Dei are deeply abhorrent."" Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times ""What drives this film is not the sense of excitement that clearly motivated Brown when he realized he had come up with a world-class premise but a sense of responsibility. A need to guard the franchise at all costs has seeped into the very bones of this project and robbed it of the excitement that a willingness to consider creative risks might have given it.""

Director Ron Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have conspired to drain any sense of fun out of the melodrama leaving expectant audiences with an oppressively talky film that isnt exactly dull but comes as close to it as one could imagine with such provocative material. A pulpy page-turner in its original incarnation as a huge international bestseller has become a stodgy grim thing in the exceedingly literal-minded film version of ""The Da Vinci Code."" Tackling head-on novelist Dan Browns controversy-stirring thriller hinging on a subversively revisionist view of Jesus Christs life director Ron Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman have conspired to drain any sense of fun out of the melodrama leaving expectant audiences with an oppressively talky film that isnt exactly dull but comes as close to it as one could imagine with such provocative material; result is perhaps the best thing the projects critics could have hoped for. Enormous public anticipation worldwide will result in explosive B.O. at the start in near-simultaneous release in most international territories beginning May 17 in some countries -- day-and-date with the official Cannes opening-night preem -- and May 19 in the U.S. and elsewhere. Sitting through all the verbose explanations and speculations about symbols codes secret cults religious history and covert messages in art it is impossible to believe that had the novel never existed such a script would ever have been considered by a Hollywood studio. Its esoteric heady stuff made compelling only by the fact that what its proposing undermines the fundamental tenets of Christianity especially Roman Catholicism and by extension Western Civilization for the past 2000 years. The irony in the films inadequacy is that the novel was widely found to be so cinematic. Although pretty dismal as prose the tome fairly rips along courtesy of a strong story hook very short chapters that seem like movie scenes constant movement by the principal characters in a series of conveyances periodic eruptions of violent action and a compressed 24-hour time frame. The appearance of its easy adaptability may have been deceptive however as what went down easily on the page becomes laborious onscreen even with the huge visual plus of fabulous French and English locations fine actors and the ability to scrutinize works of Da Vinci in detail. What one is left with is high-minded lurid material sucked dry by a desperately solemn approach. Some nifty scene-setting with strong images amplifying a Paris lecture delivered by Harvard symbology professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) intercut with the Louvre murder of curator Sauniere by albino monk Silas (Paul Bettany) spurs hope that Howard might be on track to find a visual way to communicate the books content. But from the first one-on-one scene between Robert and French police cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou occasionally hard to understand) in which she convinces him that cop Bezu Fache (Jean Reno) intends to hold him for the murder the temperature level drops and continues to do so as the pair goes on the run to stay one step ahead of Fache while using their complementary specialties to decipher the meaning of the cryptic messages Sauniere scrawled on his body in his own blood before he died. Part of the quick deflation is due to a palpable lack of chemistry between Hanks and Tautou an odd thing in itself given their genial accessibility in many previous roles. Howard normally a generous director of actors makes them both look stiff pasty and inexpressive in material that provides them little opportunity to express basic human nature; unlike in the book they are never allowed to even suggest their fatigue after a full night and day of non-stop running nor to say anything that doesnt relate directly to narrative forward movement. Its a film so overloaded with plot that theres no room for anything else from emotion to stylistic grace notes. The pursuit of a man and a woman barely known to one another was a favorite premise of Alfred Hitchcock and one need only think of the mileage the director got out of such a set-up in films from ""The 39 Steps"" to ""North by Northwest"" to realize some of the missed opportunities here. Temporary relief comes an hour in with the arrival of Ian McKellen as Sir Leigh Teabing an immensely wealthy Holy Grail fanatic to whom it falls to explain in unavoidably fascinating monologues the alternate history the story advances. It is Teabings thesis that the early Church beginning with the Emperor Constantine suppressed the feminine aspects of religion both stemming from pagan times as well as from the prominent role in spreading the faith he insists was played by Mary Magdalene a role underlined by a close look at Da Vincis celebrated ""The Last Supper."" More than that however Teabing insists that Mary Magdalene far from having been a prostitute was actually Jesus wife and that they had a daughter whose bloodline has persisted. McKellen seems to relish every moment and line which can scarcely be said of the other thesps. Given the widespread readership the book has enjoyed and the howls of protest from Christian entities beginning with the Vatican it is hardly spoiling things to point out that the baddies here are members of the strict Catholic sect Opus Dei including Silas and Alfred Molinas Bishop Aringarosa defenders of doctrine determined to eliminate the threat to the established order posed by the so-called Priory of Sion an organization secretly holding the ""knowledge"" that could cripple the church. Even after the action moves from France to England theres still a long way to go and the final dramatic revelations however mind-boggling from a content p.o.v. come off as particularly flat. The darkly burnished stylings cinematographer Salvatore Totino brought to Howards previous two films ""The Missing"" and ""Cinderella Man"" prove rather less seductive in the largely nocturnal realms of ""The Da Vinci Code."" Hans Zimmers ever-present score is at times dramatic to the point of over-insistence.
