Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr B Batman Forever Genre Action/Adventure; Starring Jim Carrey Tommy Lee Jones Nicole Kidman Val Kilmer Drew Barrymore Michael Gough Pat Hingle Debi Mazar Chris ODonnell; Director Joel Schumacher; Author Janet Scott Batchler Lee Batchler Akiva Goldsman; Release Date Wide 06/16/1995; Runtime (in minutes) 122; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted June 23 1995 -- 1200 AM EDT Watching Batman Forever is a little like spending two hours inside a happy asylum. Just about every character in the movie is undergoing some sort of an identity crisis yet rather than making the picture feel ""dark"" these various schizoid head-cases bounce off each other like brightly colored billiard balls. Whether heroes or villains they all seem to belong to the same breed of fizzy deranged exhibitionist. And the movie itself is a loony-tunes extravaganza in which having a split personality doesnt constitute a serious emotional trauma so much as it does a fashion statement. Chief among the soul-torn weirdos is Bruce Wayne (Val Kilmer) the Gotham City glamourpuss whos driven by personal demons to put on a black rubber bat costume -- contoured with a bodybuilders musculature -- and become Batman mystic vigilante of the night. There are as well a couple of megalomaniacal supervillains. Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones) is a rip-snorting hooligan whose face -- or at least half of it -- has been deformed by acid into a purplish mash of vein and sinew (it looks like an exploding eggplant). An anarchic phantom who still remembers his days as DA Harvey Dent he acts out his dual nature by making vital criminal decisions based on the toss of a coin. (Unfortunately the role doesnt give Jones much to do besides scowl under his ugly makeup.) Then theres the Riddler (Jim Carrey) whom we meet when hes still lowly Edward Nygma a long-haired techno-dweeb festering with thwarted ambition in the laboratories of Wayne Enterprises. Edward invents a device that allows TV viewers to merge with the images on their screens -- and then allows Edward to suck their minds into his until he goes giddy with brainpower. The films other key figures are Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman) a sultry criminal psychologist who cant decide whether shes got the hots for Bruce or for Batman (no wonder they get along) and Robin (Chris ODonnell) Batmans new sidekick whose youthful-hotshot tendencies are fueled by a seething private vendetta. The characters in Batman Forever are like addicts each one swallowed up in his or her own obsession. And so is the director Joel Schumacher who gets high on color and movement on the ripe possibilities of camp villainy. Schumachers work lacks the Wagnerian grandeur that Tim Burton brought to 1989s Batman and theres nothing in Batman Forever -- not even Jim Carrey the human exclamation point -- that can match the teeming bats-in-the-belfry inspiration of Jack Nicholsons performance as the Joker. Yet Batman Forever is funkier and more satisfying than the scattershot Batman Returns. Although the films frenetic rhythm is reminiscent of an Indiana Jones picture visually Schumacher directs it like a musical turning each image into eye candy weaving one lush set piece into the next as if he were the Vincente Minnelli of blockbusters. Its not just that the sets (Edward Nygmas demented pad the charcoal Batcave) are entrancing; the moods they create define the characters. The movie has a suave cheekiness all its own. Its spanked along by lines like Chases blithe come-on to Batman ""Ill bring the wine -- you bring your scarred psyche"" And for the first time the series features a lead actor sleek enough to make the heros Jekyll-and-Hyde turmoil seem a potent Pop-art dilemma. From the moment you see Val Kilmers rosebud lips protruding from Batmans cowl you know hes going to inhabit the role in a way that Michael Keaton with his dyspeptic uncertainty never quite did. Kilmer doesnt get to show a lot of personality -- he still has to think and speak in comic-strip balloons -- but hes commanding enough to make you believe in Batman as a stoic natural force. There really isnt much of a plot. (The plot is The villains try to kill Batman.) A hint that Bruce is going to confront a revelation about the murder of his parents comes to naught. And Edward Nygmas TV mind-control scheme could have used more visual zap. Its there mostly to explain how he metamorphoses into the Riddler -- that is into the prancing figure of Jim Carrey at his most ecstatically psychotic. Still what a pleasure it is to watch Carrey take over the movie His performance builds slowly getting gaudier and crazier (right along with his Riddler-as-mad-dandy outfits) until hes swiveling his hips as he tosses grenades then turning into a deranged game-show host. If he sometimes seems like the punk son of Nicholsons Joker thats because Carreys comic persona is in essence an elaboration of Nicholson the cartoon sadist the one who was born when he flashed his manic grin in The Shining and said ""Honey Im home"" By now Jim Carrey is doing sarcastic takes on his own sarcasm and theres something funny and a little scary in that. No wonder hes the star of the 90s -- I cant think of another performer who expresses his lack of sincerity with such conviction.

Comments Batman Forever The movie not the McDonalds franchise--though is it possible or even desirable to tell the two apart? This mannered and mechanical spin-off suitable for boys of five and under gives us two male couples instead of a single hero and villain--Batman and Robin (Val Kilmer and Chris ODonnell) on the one hand the Riddler and Two-Face (Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones) on the other--with Nicole Kidman as a shrink periodically turning up to validate the rampant repressed homoeroticism. At least Tim Burtons Batman had the advantage of an original Jack Nicholson performance; this time we get only familiar Carrey shtick and Joness reprise of Ty Cobb to take care of the villainy. Director Joel Schumacher submits to the Wagnerian bombast with an overly busy surface and the script by Lee and Janet Scott Batchler and Akiva Goldsman basically runs through the formula as if its a checklist; with Michael Gough and Pat Hingle.

In the negative column that action isnt as involving as it should be. An enormous fun-house ride the second ""Batman"" sequel succeeds on some basic levels while coming up short in others. On the plus side the tone has lightened up after criticism of the last outing Val Kilmer seamlessly slides into the Dark Knights cape and the film boasts considerable action and visual splendor. In the negative column that action isnt as involving as it should be and there are so many characters the movie cant adequately service them all. In the final analysis Warner Bros. nattily attired champion has more to recommend it than not and the look of a  200 million monster with not only wings but legs that should carry well into the summer. That forecast is based principally on the fact that ""Batman Forever"" is as much a finely tuned marketing/merchandising machine as a movie down to the not-so-subtle McDonalds plug (""Ill get drive-through"") after the opening credits. Casting has cleverly been calibrated to attract certain demographic constituents Jim Carrey providing his brand of lunacy for juveniles Chris ODonnell solidifying his teen heartthrob credentials adult love interest Nicole Kidman and Tommy Lee Jones as a bad guy more recognizable to older folks. Such a glut of above-the-title stars presents a major creative challenge -- what with juggling two villains while introducing Robin and a femme lead -- and the strain shows. In the resulting mayhem some may wistfully recall the relatively modest Batman/Joker chords running parallel through the first movie -- still the best of the lot. Taking the reins from producer Tim Burton director Joel Schumacher provides a visual style at times more reminiscent of ""Dick Tracy"" than Burtons ""Batman"" in its explosions of vibrant color.Those hues signify a conscious decision to make this third adventure more light-hearted and humorous. Yet while Schumacher has largely accomplished the goal of delivering a cinematic comic book hes also left the movie hollow at its core -- a distinction that may not trouble Saturday-night audiences but that nonetheless dulls the films impact beyond its sheer and unrelenting visual grandeur. Trying to recap the storyline underscores how much gets crammed into the pics two hours. With so much ground to cover the filmmakers cheat a bit by beginning in the middle as Two-Face (Jones) -- a onetime district attorney gone bad after being scarred by acid -- terrorizes Gotham. After grappling with Two-Face and his minions Batman encounters a criminal psychologist Dr. Chase Meridian (Kidman) with her own designs on Gothams hero. That ongoing romance overlaps with the introduction of Dick Grayson (ODonnell) a teenage circus acrobat who after losing his family thanks to Two-Face is taken in by Batman alter-ego Bruce Wayne. A final thread involves Carreys transformation from an addled inventor Edward Nygma into the villainous Riddler eventually teaming with Two-Face to zero in on Batmans secret identity. That leads to a somewhat anti-climactic series of showdowns beginning with a siege on Wayne Manor. Screenwriters Lee Batchler Janet Scott Batchler and Akiva Goldsman walk their own tightrope trying to find time to depict not only Robins origins (in a faithful homage to his comic books roots) but also to rehash Waynes inspiration for turning into a caped crimefighter. Its a lot to handle and Schumacher -- whos drawn recent praise for ""The Client"" but was less successful with the sci-fi-ish entries ""The Lost Boys"" and ""Flatliners"" which are as close as hes come to this genre -- doesnt have the luxury of pausing long enough to let those strands build momentum with a fight or chase always just around the corner. Carrey continues the tradition of villainous scene-stealing in the Batman movies following in Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffers footsteps. His showy turn as the Riddler is similar in its frenetic energy level to ""The Mask"" and overshadows Jones who aside from a wild cackle has little to do and lets his gruesome makeup do all the acting. ODonnell proves theres room for heroic thievery as well and his bond with Batman provides what little emotional wallop the pic can muster even though he doesnt suit up in his spiffy Robin threads until the last act. Kidman looks terrific but her Batman fixation -- creating a romantic triangle more reminiscent of the Superman/Clark Kent/Lois Lane paradox -- is clearly the least interesting element in this crowded broiler. Michael Gough also remains an unsung hero as the droll Alfred. As for Kilmer he gamely steps into the dual Batman/Wayne role but cant get much traction finding as Michael Keaton had that beyond a stern jaw theres not much to be done with it since the suit does most of the work. There is something to be said for having a Batman who can be shown with his shirt off though the villains (and perhaps Robin) again seem to be having all the fun. Technically pic benefits from a truly spectacular production design though one suspects that less would have been more allowing the viewer to absorb whats onscreen. There are some stunning images including the final shot (which should send audiences out whooping) and the Riddlers question mark filling the night sky. The costumes add enormously to the pics look though one does have to question the logic behind adding nipples to a hard-rubber superhero suit. Whose idea was that supposed to be anyway Alfreds? Not all the effects maintain those standards with some of the computer-generated Gotham cityscapes appearing too obviously ersatz. Elliot Goldenthals score while serviceable also isnt as stirring as Danny Elfmans work in the first two films. If Warner Bros. long-term aim with ""Batman Forever"" was to ""save"" the franchise then it probably has since box office will doubtless justify the Dynamic Duo fighting another day. Still that prospect is perhaps most intriguing in offering a chance to reassemble some of these sterling elements in a more tightly focused formula that might get the mix just right.

"Batman Forever | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; batman-forever ) Batman Forever (United States 1995) A movie review by James Berardinelli Its lighter brighter funnier faster-paced and a whole lot more colorful than before. Theres a new actor underneath the cape a new girlfriend on his arm and a new partner by his side. The director is different and the composer has changed. The villains -- Jim Carrey decked out in a neon question-mark jacket and Tommy Lee Jones with a face out of The Elephant Man -- are making their debuts. Yet somehow perhaps because of the costume it still feels like the same Batman weve gotten to know in two previous films. The same yet different -- and much better. Considering all the attendant hype and long box office lines for Batman Forever a review is almost superfluous. Regardless I still have an opinion and since this is my usual method of getting it into the open I see no reason to change now. So here goes... This time around the Caped Crusader (Val Kilmer) is faced with a new pair of dastardly bad guys the Riddler (Carrey) and Harvey Two-Face (Jones). The Riddler aka Edward Nigma is a scientist working in Bruce Waynes electronics factory. When he invents a device to beam television waves directly into the brain then tries it on himself he becomes unhinged (""wacko"" is the ""technical"" term used). Now hes out to control all of Gotham City and humiliate his former boss in the process. To that end he joins up with Two Face who has a more modest goal kill Batman whom he blames for his disfigurement. Meanwhile Bruce Wayne is falling for his third woman in three films. This time its a lady doctor with a name that sounds like two merged banks (Chase Meridian played by Nicole Kidman). Shes a psychiatrist who specializes in split personalities (something that afflicts just about everyone in this movie). And in the person of Dick Grayson (Chris ODonnell) who takes on the appellation Robin Batman gets a sidekick to help use all his bat-gadgets and pilot his batmobiles bat boats bat planes and bat subs. Theres a lot going on in Batman Forever -- probably much more than in either Batman or Batman Returns -- yet Joel Schumacher keeps things on an even keel moving swiftly without creating such a strong undertow that the viewer loses his or her footing. The film is a blast and ultimately a very quick two hours. In a relatively short time we get a solid action/adventure story an odd romantic triangle (Chase is attracted to Batman; Bruce Wayne is attracted to Chase -- it kind of recalls the old Lois Lane/Clark Kent/Superman thing from the first two movies about that superhero) and the most detailed exploration of Batmans character to date. All-in-all this is a very full motion picture. Schumachers vision of Gotham is similar to yet different from Tim Burtons. The same bizarre larger-than-life architecture is evident but Batman Forevers city is bigger and brighter. This is a jaunty multi-hued place that reflects a lightening in the movies tone. Burtons efforts were lugubrious and occasionally borderline demented; Schumacher acts like a grown-up having fun in a toy store. How else to explain calling his hero ""a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent"" or making sly references to Superman and the old campy Batman TV series? As the pop icon du jour Jim Carrey gets the lions share of screen time. Schumacher lets him go pretty much unchecked which leads to a great deal of over-the-top zaniness. Carrey fans will lap it up. Personally however I prefer the comedian diluted -- there are times when his Riddler gets a bit unbearable. By comparison Tommy Lee Jones equally (and wonderfully) overacted Two-Face appears subdued. Nicole Kidman is smart and sassy -- perhaps not as appealing as the leather-clad Michelle Pfeiffer but certainly an improvement over Batmans Kim Basinger. As Robin Chris ODonnell is a hip and charismatic choice. And for those who want an anchor to the previous films we have Michael Goughs reliable Alfred. Then theres the new Batman himself. Admittedly under the suit there isnt a whole lot of difference between Michael Keatons version of the Caped Crusader and the one brought to the screen by Val Kilmer. After all its just a matter of how well their lips act. As Bruce Wayne however the change is evident and its an improvement. Keatons Wayne seemed stuffy standoffish and one-dimensional. Kilmers personae brings the billionaire down-to-earth and gives him elements of passion and insecurity. I certainly didnt spend more than thirty seconds mourning the change in lead actors. Given Hollywoods poor track record with second sequels -- take the third installments of Superman Star Wars Alien Lethal Weapon and Die Hard as examples -- its understandable if a viewer approaches Batman Forever with a measure of skepticism. In this case however the trepidation can be put aside. The latest Batman proves its entirely possible for a big-budget overcommercialized blockbuster sequel to offer even the most cynical viewer a wholly enjoyable time at the movies.

On this particular world tour Batman (Val Kilmer) fights a couple of psychotic villains (Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey) tries to block out that dark day when his parents were slain and fights valiantly not to fall for a sultry executive (Nicole Kidman) who salivates over his black leather briefs. Along the way he befriends an acrobat called Dick Grayson (Chris ODonnell) a young man bent on getting revenge on Jones for deep-sixing his entire family. Its generic Batfare but the faces are new As Batman Kilmer replaces Michael Keaton who may have vanquished the Joker the Penguin and Catwoman in previous installments but came up short against Warner Bros. when he asked for more money. ODonnell plays Batmans sidekick with appealing testosteronal pluck. As abnormal-psychology shrink Dr. Chase Meridian Kidman is covering the same love-interest territory as predecessors Kim Basinger and Michelle Pfeiffer. But at least she looks different. Its the nose mainly. In the more interesting villain corner Jones is appropriately fiendish as Two-Face a former D.A. who turned nutso when a disgruntled defendant disfigured half his face with acid. But like everyone else hes eclipsed by Carrey. As the Riddler a bug-eyed madly inspired lunatic who spins riddles twists his body into every conceivable position and spouts one-liners with every breath Mr. Ace Ventura is the Biggest Kahuna of all. Even though the movie starts long before his entrance (as Batman squares off romantically with Kidman and pugilistically with Jones) things really dont get started until he shows up. Initially an underling for Bruce Wayne (Batmans alter-ego just in case youve been away from Earth a few years) he tries to get the millionaire to sponsor his new invention a 3-D box that sits in front of the TV and pumps the viewers brain with fully interactive holograms. But when Kilmer rejects Carreys idea (""It raises too many questions"" says the goody-goody millionaire) Carrey goes out on his own. Reinventing himself as the Riddler he joins forces with Jones finances his invention with organized robberies and sells a lot of gizmos. Turns out those boxes actually draw neural energy from viewers brains and download it into Carreys brain. The Riddler is sucking up the collective mental power of Gotham City as if that guy needs any more active software in his head. ""Caffeine will kill ya"" he yells with that beady Jim look after cold-cocking his first victim with a coffeepot. ""Thats never going to heal unless you stop picking"" he says later referring to Joness gruesome features. Carrey seems to increase energy as he goes along. ""Was that over the top?"" he asks at the end of one particular bout of inspired insanity. ""I can never tell"" Carrey lights up an otherwise over-scripted over-frenetic potboiler. There are so many characters to deal with (including the extended story of how Robin and Batman become partners) ""Batman"" has to swoop from one subplot to another. First its time for a dangerous flirtation with Kidman; then theres a flurry or two with Jones (who spends the movie flipping his trademark coin into the air and failing to kill Batman); now a clash is needed with the Riddler; then its bonding time with Robin; after that a gratuitous car chase through Gothams atmospheric streets must be squeezed inand so on. Director Joel Schumacher torques up the action with the impatient music-video-style editing and dizzyingly close-in shots he brought to his own ""Flatliners."" Departing from former ""Batman"" director Tim Burtons gothic approach to New York Schumacher and production designer Barbara Ling compulsively layer the background with a futuristic city design that seems to aim for ""Blade Runner"" by way of ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles."" But it really doesnt matter what the filmmakers do. It hardly matters who plays Batman although in fairness Kilmer makes an appealing superhero. Productions like thiswith assured audiences well-paid technicians and artists a huge special-effects budget and enormous studio commitmentare virtually idiot-proof. The big RV just has to show up at the theater on time. And theres every reason to suspect it wont be moving from its prime spot for a long while. Thats why they called it ""Batman Forever."" Batman Forever (PG-13)  Contains minor sexual situations and theatrical violence.

Starring Val Kilmer Tommy Lee Jones Jim Carrey Nicole Kidman and Chris ODonnell. Directed by Joel Schumacher. (PG-13. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Batman Forever"" is the ultimate in what summer movies have become. Its an art-direction Dolby-sound special-effects extravaganza a grand-scale effort thats more awe-inspiring than completely successful as entertainment. Like a rock concert it would be pointless on video. This is one film that truly does need the space of a theater -- and a packed audience on which to impose its size. ""Batman Forever"" is a sound-and-light show that jumps from the screen and spreads itself out to every corner of the house. Watching the film I kept feeling my pant legs flapping from the vibration coming up from the floor. For better or worse ""Batman Forever"" is a physical experience. A B-team was brought in for this third entry in the series with Val Kil mer replacing Michael Keaton as the caped crusader and Joel Schumacher taking over as director from Tim Burton. Both do well. Schumacher submerges his own style and essentially makes a Tim Burton Batman movie -- minus the usual Burton touches of the fey and grotesque which we can easily do without. For Kilmers part he makes as good a case for himself as did Roger Moore in his first Bond movie. Keaton may have had the edge in psychological complexity but Kilmer has nicer lips and lips are important to a masked Batman. Lips are especially important for this Batman who does a lot of kissing Later he even lets a woman realize his true identity with a kiss. Keaton with his gnarled smirky lips sticking out from the mask would have been a lot less appetizing in all these kissing scenes. Keatons was a quirky middle-aged almost unreachable Bruce Wayne. Kilmers Bruce Wayne is younger and more handsome and though hes morose and unsmiling you get the feeling most of his problems would be solved if only he got with the right girlfriend. In this case thats Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman) who is neither ugly enough nor beautiful enough to do Lauren Bacall but she gives it a good try. Chase is a specialist in abnormal psychology In ""Batman Forever"" theres a lot of abnormal psychology going around. The first rule of summer action movies is to begin with a bang. This one begins in an office building with the de ranged criminal Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones) trapping Batman and a hostage inside a safe that starts filling up with acid. But wait Theres more. Using cables and a helicopter Two-Face pulls the safe through the building. Why? That is not the question. ""Wow look at that"" is the proper response. This is not a movie about making sense. As Two-Face a former prosecuting attorney who turned to crime when half his face was scarred with acid Jones is a disappointment. He tries neither to inhabit the schizophrenic aspect of the role nor to give some sense of the pain underlying this villains madness. Instead Jones does what hes been doing lately He hams it up in an unspecific flailing-around way. This is in marked contrast to Jim Carrey as the Riddler who is even more way- out than Jones Two-Face yet always seems grounded in understandable emotion. The Riddlers lust child-like vindictiveness insecurity and screaming-preening narcissism are always right near the surface in Carreys performance which is the films main delight. ""Batman Forever"" written by first- time screenwriters Lee and Janet Scott Batchler and Akiva Goldsman (""Silent Fall"") comes up with imaginative and appropriate origins for the various characters. Here Robin (Chris ODonnell) -- a slightly less important player here than the coming attractions may have led you to believe -- is a trapeze artist whose flying family is killed by Two-Face. The Riddler starts life as E. Nygma a crazed but brilliant inventor who develops a laser device that can project images into the human brain and suck information out as well. When Bruce Wayne declines to finance the system as the latest in home entertainment Nygma cracks altogether and teams up with Two-Face to take revenge on everybody. The films most elaborate sight gag shows the brains of Gotham City citizens hooked up through their television sets to a power source that looks like a five-story neon blender. Sitting underneath the blender -- as TV sucks out peoples brains -- is the Riddler smiling like the giddiest most joy-filled eavesdropper ever. In terms of design ""Batman Forever"" presents a sustained world unto itself. As in the other renderings of Gotham City the one we get here is monumentally dreary and hard to fix in time. But into the mix production designer Barbara Ling adds a new element of suffocating clutter. The skyline is more improbable than ever a soulless mixture of Greek Egyptian and modern architecture. The new bat suits -- there are several models -- come complete with muscles and a shot of Kilmers rubber buns at one point is guaranteed to bring squeals from the audience. ""Batman Forever"" holds our interest most of the way. But the film loses momentum before its two hours are up. The jokes are all told the stunts are all done and everything that needed to blow up has blown. If they trimmed out Tommy Lee Jones and 15 minutes of superfluous special effects this would be a great movie.
