As Johnny Depp plays him with Cockney accent kohl-blackened eyes and a prancing brio that wouldnt be out of place in a Christopher Street parade hes by far the best reason to see ""Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl."" Depp gave us a glimpse of his comic finesse in the 1995 ""Don Juan DeMarco"" and here--in a Jerry Bruckheimer-produced high-seas adventure that incorporates roaring cannons oddball comedy a love story and more than a touch of the supernatural--Depp unleashes his theatrical bravado. Hes hilarious.Sparrow teams up with blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) to rescue the beautiful daughter (Keira Knightley) of the governor of Port Royal. Shes been kidnapped by Sparrows pirate nemesis Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) who thinks she can dispel an ancient curse that has turned him and his greedy grimy crew into the undead. And so on. ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" has its ups and downs but its better than a movie based on a theme-park ride has any right to be. The screenplay by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio tends to work best in its comic mode. After a while the sea battles begin to feel redundant. Director Gore Verbinskis fight scenes between the good guys and the ghostly pirate warriors suffer from the same problem that afflicted ""The Matrix Reloaded"" how can you generate life-or-death suspense with characters who cant die? Fortunately whenever the movie starts to sag Depp flies to the rescue. Its a truly piratical performance with his flamboyantly fluttering fingers he steals every scene in the movie.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

"Johnny Depp the gay blade. Slate Sign In Sign Up Johnny Depp the gay blade. Johnny Depp the gay blade. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 11 2003 430 PM The Longest Yar Pirates of the Caribbeansails too far. The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is shipwrecked. By David Edelstein Yo ho ho sailor Time was you could see two or three B pictures on a single bill--say a Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl (Walt Disney) a League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (20th Century Fox) a couple of cartoons and even a Three Stooges short. But nowadays these are A movies They cost hundreds of millions to produce and market they stretch on for hours and they leave you feeling as if youve just been keelhauled. Advertisement Pirates is OK in patches even better. Its nice to hear those ""arrrrrrrs"" and ""avast-ye""s again and to see a mob of scurvy snaggletoothed Cockney scalawags swinging from yardarms and running one another through with sabers. The Times Square matinee audience seemed happy enough with the measured storytelling and high-spirited acting and so was I for an hour and change. Johnny Depp is ingratiatingly fruity as a down-on-his-luck ex-pirate captain--a colleague calls him a ""swishbuckler""--and Hollywood has a pair of hot newly minted 20ish romantic leads in the agile unassumingly handsome Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley who can swoon prettily and then pick herself up to throw some mighty punches as a good 21st-century 18th-century heroine should. (Knightley is an uncanny hybrid the face of Winona Ryder on the willowy frame of Jennifer Garner.) The cursed crew of the ship Black Pearl--led by Geoffrey Rush who doesnt walk when he can lope or speak when he can snarl--look more or less human until the moon shines down on them. In one sequence they fight while moving in and out of lunar shafts transforming in the milky beams into rotting skeletons. At say 85 minutes this would have been a jolly little swashbuckler but at 143 it turns into an unholy trial. Whose idea was it to make not one but two trips to the hidden cave with the stash of accursed gold coins? Whose idea was it to pile on the climaxes as if storybook narratives really were interchangeable with amusement park thrill rides where people expect to travel in circles? The director Gore Verbinski is a smart man but he takes two or three beats to do what Steven Spielberg could do in one and as the movie goes on and on he seems more weighted down by his magical ingredients than buoyed by them. There is always Depp to keep you amazed. His Capt. Jack Sparrow offers proof yet again that this pretty boy doesnt want to be a romantic lead; he wants to be a titanic weirdo in the mode of his sometime mentor Marlon Brando. You thought Brandos Fletcher Christian was bizarre? Check out Depps swarthy pancake makeup and heavy mascara and jazzercising gestures--every line accompanied by a jiggly little dance. Depp is now squarely in the camp of Nicolas Cage and Crispin Glover. He is no mere actor. He is a role stylist. Whatever the tedium of Pirates its a cakewalk beside the shorter but infinitely more lugubrious League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. The movie proves that Hollywood isnt just incapable of adapting good novels its often incapable of adapting good graphic novels. This particular graphic novel written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Kevin ONeill is a witty loving and subversive exercise a way to revive all those eccentric heroes villains and monsters of the Victorian era and at the same time deconstruct the jingoist patriarchal worldview that helped give birth to them. Best of all the heroes/villains--ostensibly brought together to fight evil--are deeply unsavory prone to drug abuse murder megalomania and a host of other supposedly un-English things. In the sure-to-bomb movie directed by Stephen Norrington the characters have all been cleaned up. Allan Quatermain the adventurer turned bitter quivering junkie is now a hale and manly Sean Connery who leads a team of straitjacketed actors through some gorgeous Victorian sci-fi settings (think of fantastical blueprints out of Jules Verne) to save the empire from a supervillain who calls himself the Phantom. The comics (and H.G. Wells) homicidal Griffin the Invisible Man is now a harmless Cockney thief named Skinner (Tony Curran). Dr. Jekyll (Jason Flemyng) turns into a colossal Mr. Hyde whose obviously latex brawn makes me think I was unfair to Ang Lees Hulk. And the hearty Scandinavian-looking Peta Wilson (from TVs Nikita) has somehow been cast as the most complicated of all skinny neurasthenic English heroines Mina Murray (aka Harker) from Dracula. The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen has so many wondrous elements--the characters include Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend) and Capt. Nemo (Naseeruddin Shah) and there are allusions to the worlds of Edgar Allan Poe Arthur Conan Doyle and even Ian Fleming--that it takes awhile for the sheer inertness of the movie to hit you. But youll feel your eyes glazing over by the time all the introductions are made. And while the league is frantically attempting to keep one of the worlds most magnificent cities Venice from imploding you might find yourself thinking about going out for Gummi Bears. Men turn into brontosaurian beasts and women into demonic blood-drinkers. Zeppelins explode buildings collapse and super-submarines burst through the polar icecap. And you wait--and wait--for the magic of movies. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

Dead men tell no tales the sea chantey goes but neither will ticket buyers after sitting through this F/X-rattling Disney feature based on the Disney theme-park attraction and founded on the Disney notion that American character is best strengthened by exposing children to the horrors of computerized skeletal buccaneers Minutes after we?ve left behind the clatter and spectacle all remembrance of plot vanishes. What remains is an unreliable memory of Johnny Depp whipping up the weirdest gale force of character wind since his thespian role model Marlon Brando populated ""The Island of Dr. Moreau."" And under the circumstances the actor?s eccentric capering counts as welcome entertainment. Though it?s never made clear why Depp?s Captain Jack Sparrow is such a campy chappy - the only begotten son perhaps of rum-pitchman Captain Morgan and the Madwoman of Chaillot - at least Depp?s nutty feyness is something fresh in a summer of freeze-dried adventure pics. In all other regards ""Pirates"" steams ahead on a mirthless course of script beats and busy action sequences coldly steered by director Gore Verbinski (""The Ring"") to the boom-blast-blare coordinates of producing commodore Jerry Bruckheimer. (A boom-blast-blare score by ""Gladiator"" cocomposer Klaus Badelt proves that if suspense takes place without drums and horns to announce it it don?t mean a thing.) In the hurly-burly saga devised by Ted Elliott Terry Rossio Stuart Beattie and Jay Wolpert and written by Elliott and Rossio (who struck real gold cowriting ""Shrek"") Sparrow is a freelance gentleman-rogue operator out to recapture his ship the Black Pearl which has been stolen from under his fluttering fingers by his nemesis the floridly villainous Captain Barbossa (an expansive Geoffrey Rush who knows exactly what kind of grog he?s sloshing in). Sparrow?s ally is blacksmith-with-a-past Will Turner (""The Lord of the Rings""? Orlando Bloom) who partners up with the pirate for his own romantic reasons Held hostage aboard Barbossa?s cruise to nowhere Turner?s beloved Elizabeth Swann (""Bend It Like Beckham""?s Keira Knightley) daughter of a British colonial governor (Jonathan Pryce) fights for her freedom. It?s ornate and breathless this hoopla of a pirate story about honor and thievery and drawn swords and gilt buttons; the movie is also undecided about whether to emulate the dashing tradition of ""Treasure Island"" and ""Captain Blood"" or in bloodless postmodern style to wink at what it appears to honor. Knightley all peaches cream and pout huffs prettily as an adventuress trapped in the life of a corseted young lady. Bloom a true heartthrob makes a fitting swain. Human interaction though is only a time waster between theme-park displays of CGI prowess in which Verbinski - never a visual minimalist - seizes on the ghoulish creepiness of Barbossa?s pirate crew haunted as they are by a curse that keeps them dead-but-not-dead men. (BBC America fans will enjoy seeing skinny Mackenzie Crook out of ""The Office"" playing undead.) It?s back to Depp we go then fascinated if nothing else by the way he commandeers the movie with his every barmy line reading. ""The Pirates"" production notes cheerfully report that the actor ""developed his ideas for the character of Jack while reading the script in his sauna"" and that he ""had strong ideas about Jack?s attitude and appearance."" Waving his pinkies in the air rolling his eyes rimmed in glitter-rock shadow lolling languidly and speaking in a mysterious slurred accent inspired in part he has said by Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards and Looney Toons? Gallic skunk Pepe Le Pew Depp certainly has character ideas. But who is this exceedingly unbuckled swasher? And is the laugh not only on the conventions of the genre but also on us? ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is so bifurcated a project - half perfunctory action saga half Monty Python festival of theatrical mugging - that a ticket to the thrill-less ride may result in the altogether more alienating sensation that no one?s in charge - indeed that for two and a quarter hours a twisted battle for control has been taking place between Verbinski/Bruckheimer who demand a vertiginous historical thriller and Depp who fancies a bit of arch vogueing while sporting shells in his braided hair. There may be nothing more fun for actors than experimental exaggeration especially when filming on a Caribbean island. But there?s nothing that makes an audience feel less welcome than not being in on the joke.

Like most of the movies Bruckheimer has brought us over the past two decades -- on his own and collaborating with his late producing partner Don Simpson -- Pirates of the Caribbean hurls you about its narrative with thunderous bombast like a really expensive theme-park ride. The movie is big and loud from the start and the 100-million-plus budget is indisputably up there on the screen having bought an elaborate period production design and loads of digital visual effects that were reportedly almost not finished in time for the movies premiere. And its more than fitting -- isnt it? -- that Bruckheimer should be the first in that dog-chasing-its-own-tail world of studio ""tentpole"" movies to propose the conversion of a venerable Disneyland attraction into a hit summer movie (instead of vice versa). But having successfully reversed the natural order of things even Bruckheimer must pay the price for playing God. Like the woeful Gladiator (and Moulin Rouge and Chicago) before it Pirates arrives with all the trappings of manufactured novelty the much-fretted-over (by many well-paid marketing consultants) conviction that its something exciting and new mainly because its been so long since the last of its kind. And indeed the pirate movie once a reliable Hollywood subgenre has been seen about as infrequently in recent years as the sword-and-sandal epic (or the big-budget musical) with two pricey attempts at revival -- Roman Polanskis Pirates (1986) and Renny Harlins Cutthroat Island (1995) -- doing little more than bankrupt their respective financiers. However neither of those movies bore the Walt Disney Pictures imprimatur (as does Pirates of the Caribbean though the PG-13 rated film is perhaps the most graphically violent ever to do so) or had the good fortune of coming along in this age of everything-old-is-new-again. Pirates will certainly make a bigger splash than its immediate predecessors though its success will be rooted more in its ad campaign and fortuitous timing than in anything particularly innovative about the story -- or the treatment -- itself. Perhaps realizing what a sure-bet concept they were sitting on screenwriters Ted Elliot Terry Rossio and Jay Wolpert have given the Pirates script everything but their all Its cobbled together out of drawing-room scenes and action-movie scenarios as stiff as the corset drawn tightly about the movies beautiful young heroine (Keira Knightley). (The movie cant even be bothered to steal from good examples of the genre such as Albert Parkers 1926 The Black Pirate.) Meanwhile director Gore Verbinski hasnt brought an ounce of inspiration or imagination to the project that wasnt already there on the page. Which may be exactly as Bruckheimer wanted it. A prolific Hollywood workhorse Verbinski is the sort of filmmaker who has a reputation for taking care of business on time and on budget. (No matter that he hasnt made a good film since his debut feature Mouse Hunt in 1997.) He even sometimes lends a helping hand to troubled projects (like last years The Time Machine). Which also makes him a reminder of just how much Bruckheimer who began his career by supporting the work of such maverick talents as Michael Mann and Paul Schrader has come to rely on proficient hacks to pump out his signature orange-and-blue-tinted assembly-line action spectacles. What after all can you say about a producer for whom Michael Bay -- in movies like Armageddon and Pearl Harbor -- represents the greatest potential threat to his own unimpeded authorship of a movie?

Sep. 13 600pm Presumably Wolpert (get this a former game-show producer) was the one to come up with the movies forlorn premise A set of looted gold pieces must be reunited in order to break their cursed hold over the pirates who stole them. (Wait a second Wasnt that one of the challenges on last weeks episode of Dog Eat Dog?) Elliot and Rossio were probably solicited to pump the dialogue full of catty one-liners on the order of their animated hit Shrek so that Johnny Depp (as the pirate anti-hero Jack Sparrow) and Geoffrey Rush (as the pirate villain Barbossa who suffers the wrath of the cursed gold) could step into the ogre-and-ass routine vacated by Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy. The actors are up to the task Depp with dreadlocked hair and braided goatee swishes and glides through every frame like a younger gayer Captain Morgan (or maybe like a brilliant actor whos happy to be picking up a fat easy paycheck) while Rush jiggles his eyes madly about stoked on his own nefariousness. But even as the jokes fly faster and more furiously than the movies slashing sabers Pirates of the Caribbean quickly reveals how exhausted such shtick becomes when it isnt being animated by Shreks colorful computer-generated imagery. Here Verbinskis pacing is glacial as he baby-steps us through the tiresome business of a young noblewoman (Knightley) her vying upper-class and lower-class suitors (the latter of whom is played by The Lord of the Rings Orlando Bloom) and the protracted kidnapping that finally gets this dry-docked enterprise out on the open sea. At which point Verbinski shows himself to be an inept orchestrator of action scenes His sword fights have no forward thrust no death-defying grandeur and when his pirates swing about in the rigging swooping from one neighboring ship to the next on vinelike halyards you dont feel at all like youre soaring right alongside them. (If there was one thing Cutthroat Island had going for it it was superb stunt choreography and a crack sense of how to shoot and edit it.) Yet this may be more than enough to satiate most audiences particularly those loath to admit defeat after shelling out for a family night at the movies. The folks at Disney seem particularly protective of this one even by their own insanely overprotective standards. The show of security at a recent press screening was among the most absurd yet in the major studios ongoing anti-piracy circus rivaled only by preparations for a flight on El Al. On the other hand -- evidently terrified in its terminal PC-ness of Song of the South- or Charlie Chan-style protests by swashbuckler activist groups -- Disney has made sure that Pirates of the Caribbean all but endorses its protagonists lifestyle the message being that its really okay to pirate stuff (except of course where Disney products are concerned). But the treasure hunters who do manage to sneak a video camera into a screening of Pirates will emerge gravely disappointed. The booty here is 100 percent fools gold.

Make way for the sizzling swashbucklers whose comical saga makes for serious fun. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley shine in Pirates. The most stimulating movies of the summer thus far have been documentaries Spellbound and Capturing the Friedmans. Finally theres a big-budget popcorn movie that delivers what moviegoers hunger for humor action thrills and charismatic characters. Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl( 1/2 out of four ) is the summer blockbuster weve been waiting for. From the haunting opening sequence with a little girl eerily singing the infamous ""Yo Ho"" song Pirates grabs audiences and doesnt let go. And it stars two screen hunks Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp who looks sexy despite the gold teeth and matted hair. Depps dissipated Captain Jack Sparrow is the offbeat centerpiece of the movie. He lives on his wits though he has spent a tad too much time on the high seas with the sun beating down on him. Sparrow comes sailing to the village of Port Royal run by Gov. Swann (Jonathan Pryce) whos determined to see his lovely daughter Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) married off to the influential Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport). However Elizabeth has long had eyes for blacksmith Will Turner (Bloom) who shares her unexpressed devotion. The towns calm is shattered when the pirate crew from the creepy Black Pearl manned by the evil Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) invades in search of a lost gold medallion. The barbarous buccaneers kidnap Elizabeth (who has the medallion) and plan to sacrifice her. While the stuffy Norrington sails off to her rescue Turner joins forces with Sparrow who has hijacked the fastest ship around. Together they uncover the mystery behind the Black Pearl. Who would have guessed after last years dismal Country Bears that a second movie based on a Disney theme park ride could be rip-roaring fun? And as if the Disney ride stigma werent challenge enough pirate movies have been notorious failures in recent years. (Remember Cutthroat Island?) Pirates director Gore Verbinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer expertly navigated the rough waters to avoid the genres pitfalls overblown action sequences unbelievable characters dated sagas. Their efforts and those of screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio (who also wrote Shrek) strike just the right tone. The dazzling visuals (ghostly skeletons brawl in the moonlight aboard a haunted galleon) and spectacular swordsmanship blend seamlessly with comic moments. This kind of movie works best if it doesnt take itself too seriously (think Indiana Jones) and Pirates has some great moments of humorous self-deprecation. Pirates will enthrall kids and amuse adults. Its only failing is that at 2 hours and 15 minutes its about 20 minutes too long. But Pirates is still boatloads of fun.

Starring Johnny Depp Geoffrey Rush Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley. (PG-13. 125 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is an amusement park ride at Disneyland and now its a movie based on the ride. Is this a sign of the apocalypse? No but it does suggest a dearth of inspiration and portends a movie made up entirely of surfaces filled with air -- a shell game with all shells and no pea. Thats about the size of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" (subtitled ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"") though the filmmakers run with the concept farther than might be expected. The sneering comic villainy of Geoffrey Rush the boy-cake appeal of Orlando Bloom and some of Johnny Depps most successful character work in years keep this ship afloat for most of its running time. But eventually the concept buckles under the heavy blockbuster treatment becoming a monotonous repetitive spectacle of endless shipboard sword fights and pirate ghosts in the moonlight. The picture was directed by Gore Verbinski (""The Ring"") but the more significant credit is that of the producer Jerry Bruckheimer. One of the very few producer-auteurs Bruckheimer makes grand spectacular movies (""Con Air"" ""The Rock"") that at their best have a certain gut-level appeal. That appeal which invariably has to do with the story is the elusive part and thats what is missing from ""Pirates of the Caribbean."" Depp plays Jack an 18th century pirate captain who washes up on an island port owned by the British having lost his ship. Weather-beaten with long hair a mouthful of gold teeth and a braided beard he looks like a dangerous freak his glazed eyes deadened by all manner of depravity. Then he starts talking rolling his head in an odd way and mumbling half to himself and we realize that he sounds familiar. It takes about 15 minutes to figure it out but to save you the time Depp is imitating Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones. The story of ""Pirates"" involves a group of people each of whom is trying to recover something. Jack wants to get his ship the Black Pearl back from Barbossa (Rush) the fellow pirate who commandeered it. Young Will Turner (Bloom) an earnest blacksmith wants to rescue his sweetheart the royal governors daughter Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) who was kidnapped by Barbossa. Barbossa himself is hoping to use Elizabeth to recover his humanity. He needs her in order to break a curse. And of course Elizabeth wants to recover her freedom. The essential problem of ""Pirates"" is that none of these quests has any visceral interest or impact with the exception possibly of Elizabeths quest for freedom. But in her case theres nothing she can do -- shes stuck on the ship. The movie instead concentrates on the effort of Capt. Jack to regain the Black Pearl but why should an audience care if a pirate who spends his life pillaging has himself been robbed? Moreover though everyone in the movie is intent on making sure that Barbossa is never able to break the Black Pearl curse that he and his crew are suffering under its hard to see what would be the harm in that. As a result ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is an adventure without rooting interest and only spectacle to sustain it. Flash and dazzle do buy it some time. There is the handsome time-travel aspect of seeing red-coated British soldiers and the eeriness of watching cursed pirates turning into skeletons at the first sign of the moon. There is also something to be said for the sheer brazenness of the movies embrace of the pirate film genre -- the faux rotting teeth on every bit player and the cartoonish pirate accents. But eventually this medicine stops working despite increased dosages. Elizabeth goes to stab Barbossa and the movie slams into something that looks like a musical number. The soundtrack cranks up and were treated to minutes of heavily choreographed nonsense with a group of pirates tossing up Elizabeth and catching her. Thats the first sign of desperation in ""Pirates"" and others keep coming. Eventually the movie is reduced to scene after scene of living humans fighting skeleton pirates but because skeleton pirates cant be killed theres not much point in watching. At least Depp and Rush are fun to watch and so is Bloom within the limits of the nice-guy role consigned to him. As Elizabeth Knightley holds her own in this company so much that it comes as a real surprise that shes only 18. This has to be one of the most poised and adult-seeming 18-year-old actresses since Kirsten Dunst -- or Loretta Young. Advisory This film contains gun and sword violence.

On second thought its safe to say the issue will almost certainly not come up. Still the premise engaging acting and colorful action bursts throughout keep things amusing enough for about 90 of the pictures uncalled-for 143 minutes. Both the best and worst film ever inspired by a theme park ride ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" will pose a unique challenge to the various years-end awards-giving entities which will have to decide if the picture is an original or actually an adaptation of something even if that something has no narrative or name characters. On second thought its safe to say the issue will almost certainly not come up given that the script by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio doesnt come within a sea-dogs spitting distance of these clever writers work on ""Shrek."" Still this Jerry Bruckheimer production could have been a lot worse given the premise and enough disarming humor engaging acting and colorful action bursts through to keep things amusing enough for about 90 of the pictures uncalled-for 143 minutes. The 50-year slump in pirate picture B.O. notwithstanding Disney should pocket some tidy coin from this boisterous attraction here and abroad. After enjoying heady days when Douglas Fairbanks and then Errol Flynn sailed the cinematic seas the pirate picture pretty much sank into economic oblivion after Disneys ""Treasure Island"" and the Burt Lancaster hit ""The Crimson Pirate"" in the early 50s. Discounting Steven Spielbergs misfired ""Hook"" which benefited from its ""Peter Pan"" connection the recent decades have been long ones for seafaring criminals as everything from ""Swashbuckler"" ""The Pirate Movie"" and ""Yellowbeard"" to Roman Polanskis ""Pirates"" and Renny Harlins notorious ""Cutthroat Island"" has found the commercial currents very treacherous indeed. Undaunted Disney and Bruckheimer have jumped in with colors flown high sabers firmly in hand and CGI artists employed en masse and the picture does represent something new for each of them this is the first time that the ""Walt Disney Presents"" banner has been used on a PG-13 release and it also marks the first Bruckheimer production set prior to the 20th century. Hinging on a gold medallion much coveted by the miserable lot who sail under the skull and crossbones on the Black Pearl action unsurprisingly pits the ragged ruffians under the command of the infamous Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) against the British crown repped here by Caribbean isles Governor Swann (Jonathan Pryce) and the areas naval leader Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport). Latter is a terribly serious fellow keen to marry Swanns fetchingly feisty teenage daughter Elizabeth (Keira Knightley). The wild card in the mix is Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) a rather dippy pirate who unceremoniously arrives in Port Royal in desperate need of a ship. Just as he is managing to humiliate the Brits by commandeering the H.M.S. Interceptor out of harbor the city is attacked by Barbossas goons. The latter kidnap Elizabeth who eight years before found the medallion from Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) when he washed up on a raft after a pirate attack. Living on the remnants of some formerly formidable wits Sparrow slithers between both sides in the conflict. The British would be happy to fit him for a noose anytime but he saves his neck temporarily by agreeing to help earnest blacksmith Will rescue Elizabeth who willingly hands over the medallion to Barbossa on board the Black Pearl only to be spirited away to the caves of Tortuga. There the importance of the medallion is revealed Surrounded by a small mountain of treasure Barbossa discloses that his crew victims of the ""curse of Cortez"" are in fact the walking dead which explains why they can alternate between fleshly bodies and skeletons. To lift the curse Barbossa needs not only this final piece of gold to be restored to the collection but some particular blood. But whose? Elizabeths? Wills? It takes a while for him to figure this out and considerably longer to arrange to obtain it. Narrative has the medallion changing hands and Jacks loyalties tested at least once too often and in the final stretch -- and it is that -- the filmmakers pile apparent climax upon apparent climax to such an extent that it really is impossible to know if theyre faking it. Still the pictures constant forward movement and breezy sense of amusement about itself provide a certain mild sort of diversion. Dialogue is peppered with chuckle-inducing often self-deprecating riffs Gore Verbinskis direction has a nimble lightness of touch thats far preferable to a heavy hand the action has moments of flair and the canvas has been painted with attractive colors (even if sometimes too obviously so by CGI doodlers). But most surprisingly for a theme-park ride movie its the two central performances that command the most attention. Elaborately decked out with a bandana raccoon-like black eye makeup dreadlocks two beard braids and lousy teeth (theres a screen credit ""dental special effects for Johnny Depp"") the magnetic star cuts an unusual figure magnified in oddness by the eccentric layerings he gives to Jack Sparrow. Frequently slurring his words but usually intelligible (Depp also had two specially credited sound technicians) the actor makes his character convincingly half-daft with fey mannerisms that raise even more interesting questions. Although there is no specific referencing Depps turn here nonetheless puts one in mind of some of Marlon Brandos more oddball screen outings which often ended up being the most interesting elements in those pictures even if they werent particularly coherent or even plausible. Hitting exactly the right tone is Rush who in every way fulfills the universal fantasy of what a treacherous bloodthirsty and capable pirate captain should be. Thesp single-handedly makes all his scenes more delicious than they would be without him and provides a satisfying foil for Depp as well as a fascinating contrast in acting styles. Bloom is fine but can do only so much with his conventional role while Knightley currently on view in ""Bend It Like Beckham"" specializes here in striking determined willful poses while in positions of dire jeopardy.

"Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; pirates-of-the-caribbean-the-curse-of-the-black-pearl ) Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl (United States 2003) A movie review by James Berardinelli For those taking a global view of Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl its very easy to be cynical. This is after all cross-promotion at its most blatant. What could be more marketable that one of Disneys most popular theme park attractions? The name recognition is already in place - all thats necessary to complete the puzzle is a story that will fit the ride. But there are two reasons why jaded ranting isnt the best way to proceed with this review. In the first place no one really cares. And more importantly this is actually an entertaining experience. Pirates of the Caribbean is good but not great. Swashbuckling adventures are few and far between these days so its a pleasant surprise to see one that is competently made. To add to the enjoyment the movie never takes itself too seriously. If there wasnt so much action it would be tempting to classify the production as a comedy. Alas Pirates of the Caribbean runs for a good 30 minutes too long (the protracted battles with the undead who cannot be killed become repetitive) and the denouement is on the weak side. Taken as a whole however the movie represents solid fun. A word of caution to parents however the PG-13 rating is an indicator that certain elements of the movie are not for younger children. Proceed carefully with sensitive under-11 children. Capn Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is a pirate whos infamous for his ineptitude. After rescuing a damsel Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) he finds himself being thanked by her father (Jonathan Pryce) and her would-be betrothed (Jack Davenport) while simultaneously being arrested for piracy. He escapes but after losing a duel with the heroic blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) who pines for Elizabeth he is sent back to jail. However when the town comes under attack by the pirate ship Black Pearl and its blackguard of a captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) kidnaps Elizabeth Will springs Jack from prison so the pirate can help him retrieve his beloved. But Barbossa isnt interested in a ransom. He and his crew are cursed to walk the Earth as the living dead until a blood sacrifice can restore their humanity. As was true with director Gore Verbinskis previous outing The Ring Pirates of the Caribbean oozes atmosphere. The humor keeps it from becoming too creepy but there are still a few chills to be had. I was in some ways reminded of Sam Raimis Army of Darkness where there were lots of skeletons marching around some of which were acting like the Three Stooges. Verbinski gets huge assists from cinematographer Dariusz Wolski and composer Klaus Badelt who is responsible for one of 2003s few memorable musical scores. And of course we get to hear a few refrains of the memorable Pirates of the Caribbean anthem ""Yo ho Yo ho A pirates life for me"" Pirates of the Caribbean belongs to Johnny Depp. Keira Knightley (now a familiar face in the wake of Bend It Like Beckham) and Orlando Bloom (The Lord of the Rings Legolas sans ears and blond hair) make a cute couple and Geoffrey Rush is typically over-the-top as the bad guy but the star of every scene is Depp. With several gold teeth in his mouth and beads in his hair Depp plays the part with an engaging goofiness that sets the movies tone. In one scene Sparrow becomes blind drunk but his behavior isnt all that different from when hes sober - a clear indicator of where Depp elected to take the character. Sparrow is a rogue through-and-through and although he may have a heart of gold its definitely tarnished. Take away Depp and youre left with a derivative and dull motion picture. As is mandated by the first rule of summer movies - sustain the action - Pirates of the Caribbean is wall-to-wall battles chases and fights. The only pauses are those necessitated by the need to advance the plot through exposition. Theres lots of swordplay including a lengthy and memorable struggle between Sparrow and Will. Its probably the best example of cinematic swordfighting since The Mask of Zorro. (It doesnt come close to the clash between Wesley and Inigo Montoya in The Princess Bride. In that movie the actors did their own fencing. Here its clear from the obscuring camera angles that stunt performers were involved.) For those who are familiar with the amusement park attraction most of the key scenes are included (although the hairy leg is missing) emphasizing the movies tie-in nature. And if youre dying to see another Disneyworld/Disneyland ride turned into a cinematic endeavor theres hardly any wait at all - The Haunted Mansion is due out at Thanksgiving. Personally I cant wait for Space Mountain.

"CNN.com - Review Pirates of the Caribbean glorious - Jul. 10 2003 The Web CNN.com Home Page World U.S. Weather Business Sports Politics Law Technology Science amp; Space Health Entertainment Travel Education Special Reports SERVICES Video E-mail Newsletters CNNtoGO SEARCH Web CNN.com Overview | Gallery | Quiz Review Pirates of the Caribbean glorious Film a terrific throwback to pirate movies of yore By Paul ClintonCNN Reviewer Keira Knightley and Johnny Depp in ""Pirates of the Caribbean."" Story Tools RELATED  CNN.com  Reviews archive (CNN) -- The last time Disney Studios used a theme park ride as the inspiration for a feature film the result was an unwatchable mess called ""The Country Bears."" So I was less than excited upon hearing that yet another 15-minute amusement park ride was being dragged to the big screen. But shiver me timbers ""The Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is a rousing action/adventure flick reminiscent of the glory years of pirate films 50 years ago. Much of the success of this venture can be attributed to the outstanding cast -- especially Johnny Depp. Hes marvelous as the pirate captain Jack Sparrow a hippy-dippy rogue who looks a lot like Cher in her ""Gypsies Tramps and Thieves"" period. Depps Sparrow is a sexually ambivalent fop one minute a dashing sword-slashing action hero the next. The films considerable wit and humor is largely conveyed through his exquisitely eccentric character. Geoffrey Rush is also an absolute delight as Captain Barbossa a deliciously black-hearted evildoer who stole Sparrows ship the Black Pearl. And Orlando Bloom who came to fame with the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy continues his winning streak playing Will Turner a blacksmith in the Caribbean town of Port Royal. Turner has been in love since childhood with Elizabeth Swann the beautiful daughter of the governor of Port Royal played by Keira Knightley (""Bend It Like Beckham""). However she reluctantly has become engaged to the ambitious Commodore Norrington played with a stiff upper lip by Jack Davenport. Pursuing gold In ""Pirates"" Orlando Bloom is a lovelorn blacksmith smitten with Knightleys character Elizabeth Swain. Before the Commodore can claim his bride she is kidnapped by Barbossa who is on a mission to end a curse placed upon his ship and his men. It seems the group stole some Aztec gold and theyre now skeleton ghosts doomed forever to rattle around in an existence between life and death -- unless they return every piece of the loot. That last piece is in Elizabeths possession and now she and the final scrap of gold are on their way to the mysterious Isla de Muerta to end the unholy curse. Determined to rescue the love of his life Turner enlists the help of Sparrow whos about to be hanged for piracy. Together the unscrupulous unwashed pirate (with really great eye makeup) and the steady-hearted true-blue youth steal the fastest ship in the British fleet the H.M.S. Interceptor and race across the high seas to save the fair damsel in distress. Incidentally pardon all the cliches -- but if ever a movie made them sing its this one. Lots of fun Geoffrey Rush is a cursed pirate in ""Pirates of the Caribbean."" This is the first period film attempted by producer Jerry Bruckheimer best known for special-effects extravaganzas such as ""The Rock"" (1996) and ""Con Air"" (1997). Hes delivered a good old-fashioned swashbuckler. Bruckheimer readily admits he loved old pirate films such as ""Treasure Island""(1934) ""Captain Blood"" (1935) and ""The Crimson Pirate"" (1952) and he has created a film with the flavor and fun of those wonderful Hollywood classics. Director Gore Verbinski who hit it big with his last film -- the overrated but very creepy ""The Ring"" -- has done a fine job with all the color and spectacle. With ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" hes taken two different genres -- the supernatural ghost flick and an 18th-century high seas adventure story -- and blended them into rich stew that sweeps the audience away on a spirited journey. Of course it all begins with the blank page and the picaresque plot by Academy Award-nominated screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio (who did ""Shrek"") rings all the right bells and blows all the lively whistles. Huge battle scenes between lumbering wooden ships with cannons blazing breathtaking sword fights vicious pirates -- complete with peg legs and parrots -- a love story that must overcome one obstacle after another and plenty of witty asides are all a part of this engaging mix. ""Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is one of the few must-see films of this summer. ""Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl"" opens nationwide on Wednesday July 9 and is rated PG-13.
