Comments (2) Sideways Rated R  123 minutes I cant go along with my colleagues who regard Alexander Paynes entertaining but familiar comedy as one of 2004s best movies it lacks the insolence of his Election and the freshness of his work with Kathy Bates in About Schmidt. A depressive divorced unpublished novelist (American Splendors Paul Giamatti) and a cheerful horny former TV star (Thomas Haden Church) whos about to be married embark on a tour of the California wine country that includes sexual adventures. The performances of both leads (especially Church) Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh are effective and Payne does know how to capture two kinds of male menopause. But I cant say he ever surprised me.

And the better he gets the less attention he calls to himself theres not a frame in his wonderful new movie ""Sideways"" that asks you to marvel at the directors virtuosity. Even more than ""About Schmidt"" which was dominated by Jack Nicholson a huge presence even inside the skin of a mild insurance salesman ""Sideways"" stays resolutely life-size. And that in this age of hype and hyperventilation may be the most radical thing about it.This deceptively modest comedy leaves a long aftertaste. It follows two clueless middle-aged men making a last-hurrah tour of the Santa Barbara wine country before one of them gets married. Miles (Paul Giamatti) is a failed novelist who teaches eighth-grade English. A tightly wound bundle of anxiety and self-loathing hes still licking his wounds from a bitter divorce. But all his self-pity and uncertainties vanish in the face of his passion for wine. As an obsessive discriminating oenophile he achieves mastery. He can wax rhapsodic about the personality of a pinot noir. The mere mention of merlot fills him with contempt.The groom-to-be Jack (Thomas Haden Church) his former roommate at San Diego State couldnt be more different. A onetime soap actor now doing commercial voice-overs hes an affable vain southern California extrovert a fortysomething party guy who still calls people ""dude"" insists on positive thinking and is as unaware of a good Sauvignon blanc as he is of his own unquenchable narcissism. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Miles envisions a relaxing week of wine tasting and golf. But Jack has other priorities for his last week of freedom--he wants to get laid. And he wants to shake Miles out of his two-year depression. ""Dont go to the dark side man"" he warns his moody friend. Giamatti and Church are an inspired comic team a Mutt and Jeff drawn with subtle novelistic detail. (Payne and his writing partner Jim Taylor based their screenplay on a previously un-published novel by Rex Pickett.) ""Sideways"" is a road movie about a classic odd couple but nothing about it feels formulaic. Filled with ambivalent emotions and middle-aged panic its a comedy that gets funnier and sadder as it goes.The movie hits its stride with the arrival of Maya (Virginia Madsen) a striking down-to-earth waitress whose knowledge of wine rivals Miless and her friend Stephanie (Sandra Oh) a savvy seductive wine pourer whom Jack puts the moves on. Their wine-fueled double date which ends at Stephanies house is a marvel of ensemble acting and pitch-perfect writing. While Jack and Stephanie make a beeline to bed Miles and Maya retreat to the porch where they court by talking only of wine. When he tells her why he loves pinot noir hes describing his own temperamental self; when she explains what the ever-evolving nature of wine means to her shes revealing her soul. Its a beauty of a scene.These romances are all built on lies--chief among them Jacks failure to mention hes about to get married. Soon enough the cats come tearing out of the bag with hilarious heartbreaking repercussions. Oh (who is married to the director) is a pure delight as the sensual Stephanie who rocks Jacks easily upended world. Madsen whos been wasted playing B-movie femmes fatales blossoms as this smart centered divorcee Payne lets us see her--and ""Wings"" TV actor Church--in a whole new way. These are career-changing performances.""Sideways"" paints an unblinkingly funny portrait of the male ego in middle-aged disarray. But the harsh satirical edge that underlay ""Citizen Ruth"" ""Election"" and parts of ""Schmidt"" has given way to a more generous forgiving spirit. The womanizing Jack may be infantile but hes a likable monster. Whiny as well as winey Miles is a first-class party pooper but Giamatti takes us so deep inside his sad-sack psyche you cant help but root for his redemption. In ""Sideways"" Payne has created four of the most lived-in indelible characters in recent American movies. This deliciously bittersweet movie makes magic out of the quotidian. And makes it look effortless.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

The first knock is a harsh awakening into the kind of life that makes you want to stay in bed; the second a tentative tap of hope a suggestion of better things ahead. In between is a note-perfect detailed character study painfully real and strikingly funny. Miles (Paul Giamatti) is as carefully corked as the pinot noirs he loves; never comfortable despite his practical shoes. A divorced would-be novelist hes been ""officially depressed for two years"" hiding behind a veil of wine snobbery that allows him to pretend that he isnt an alcoholic. (Hes the sort who elaborately sticks his nose into wine glasses smelling ""a flutter of cheese."") As we meet him hes preparing for a road trip to the Santa Barbara wine country with his friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church) a former actor and compulsive womanizer who sees the trip as his last gasp of freedom before his wedding the following weekend. And off they go in Miles beat-up Saab in search of wine (Miles) and women (Jack). They find both -- some nicely nuanced pinots and two very self-possessed women. Maya (Virginia Madsen) a waitress horticulture student and oenophile fixes her gentle smile on Miles while the more direct Stephanie (Sandra Oh) leers playfully at Jack. Trouble lies hangovers and an emergency-room visit ensue as do some lyrical conversations about life masquerading as conversations about wine. Movie review Showtimes and trailer  ""Sideways"" with Paul Giamatti Thomas Haden Church Virginia Madsen Sandra Oh. Directed by Alexander Payne from a screenplay by Payne and Jim Taylor based on the novel by Rex Pickett. 124 minutes. Rated R for language some strong sexual content and nudity. Neptune Uptown. Payne and his co-writer Jim Taylor here take a less satirical and more gentle view of humanity than in their previous works (""Citizen Ruth"" ""Election"" ""About Schmidt"" each also a small masterpiece of character). ""Sideways"" based on a fine novel by Rex Pickett is at once a literate comedy a subtle examination of grown-up romance and a touching study of friendship. Miles and Jack despite their constant arguments are clearly essential to each other. Theres a remarkable moment near the end as the men say goodbye at the end of their trip in which their expressions reveal that these two regular guys love each other in the way that only longtime friends can. But most of all its a showcase for four splendid actors who rarely get this kind of opportunity to shine. Oh the tart best friend in ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" purrs with pleasure in her early scenes; later her rage is spectacular (and deafening) to behold. Madsen a glowing dreamgirl in a wine-colored sweater is all warmth. Life has disappointed Maya but she remains an optimist knowing something better is coming. In a simple and direct performance Madsen shows us -- and draws us to -- a complicated woman. Church a former sitcom star does something miraculous with Jack Hes a larger-than-life guy (quite literally; even his swoosh of hair is bigger than anyone elses) performed with great delicacy. Jack is enthusiastic for life even as Miles shrinks from it; he has a slow emphatic thumbs-up thats hilarious in its cluelessness. All wine to Jack tastes pretty good even if hes chewing gum while tasting it; all women are beauties. And Giamatti who emerged last year in ""American Splendor"" is brilliant letting Miles break our hearts even as he drives us crazy with his fussiness his bluntness his constant explanations and information. Throughout the movie he says one thing and means another Watch his face when he says hes stopped caring about his ex-wife or his devastating holding-together-the-pieces pain as he congratulates her on her pregnancy. (Victoria he remembers fondly ""had the best palate of any woman Ive ever known."") Hes like his favorite wine a thin-skinned grape easily bruised. ""Sideways"" punctuated by Rolfe Kents bopping jazz score texturized by the almost aggressively ordinary interiors that have become Paynes trademark and lit by Madsens eyes is a marvelous journey -- to the bottom of a wineglass and to the inside of a soul.

The movie was set and filmed in the Santa Ynez Valley and other locations in Santa Barbara County. Movies Sideways A Witty Trip to Whine Country By Teresa Wiltz Washington Post Staff Writer Friday October 29 2004; Page C05 Miles is your basic middle-age mope a passive-aggressive depressive with a stalled life Hes got a failed marriage a manic mother a 750-page novel that no one will publish and a regrettable tendency to dial while drunk. ""Ive stopped caring"" he intones ""to hell with it."" Problem is Miles does care cares too much and numbs out all that caring with Prozac and a nightly glass (okay bottle) of some really fine wine from one of his many trips to Napa Valley. This is the guy you see at cocktail parties the one who carries on a little too long and a little too loudly about wine husbandry. (""Quaffable. But far from transcendent."") Hes the guy who never gets the girl or if he does he doesnt get her for very long hence the drunken dialing. Miles (Paul Giamatti left) and Jack (Thomas Haden Church) drown their sorrows in Napa Valley where they drink wine and woo women. (Merie W. Wallace -- AP) _____More in Movies_____  Sideways Details  Watch the Trailer  Profile Paul Giamatti  Transcript Alexander Payne Online  Current Movie Openings  Arts amp; Living Movies Free E-mail Newsletters Washington Entertainment GuideSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now MoviesSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now TravelSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now At HomeSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now ""Sideways"" may sound depressing but its far from bleak. Director Alexander Payne (""Election"" ""About Schmidt"") manhandles well the terrain of the lonely loser. Humor wins over pathos as in the scene in which Miles on a heroic mission to retrieve his buddys wallet from a suburban tract home of a married conquest is chased out of the house by the womans husband a raging naked guy in a skullcap who slams his considerable paunch naughty bits and all against the car window. Its a choke-on-your-popcorn moment and yet it never feels unbelievable. Miles as played by Paul Giamatti in the wonderfully understated film is an Everynerd who started out with a semblance of promise and somehow got off track oh a decade or so ago. Giamattis middle school English teacher cant seem to connect with anyone let alone his students. His idea of a good time is retiring with a glass of pinot noir and the latest issue of Barely Legal. So its a major stretch beyond his comfort zone when he agrees to go on a road trip with another loser his college buddy Jack (Thomas Haden Church) a soap star who was once sorta famous but now is mostly known for his work in spray starch commercials. Jacks getting married in a week an event hes approaching with the ambivalence unique to an aging pretty boy He knows his skirt-chasing days are numbered but hes still chasing. So they drive up and around Napa Valley squabbling sucking back wine and wooing women. Jack thinks the answer to all Miless problems is to be found in the sack ""You need to get your joint worked on"" he tells him. Miles cant understand why Jack is obsessed with getting laid when hes getting married in a week. Eventually they take up with two women they encounter in wine country Stephanie (Sandra Oh) a single mom a little too eager to anoint Jack with instant stepdaddyhood; and Maya (Virginia Madsen) a world-weary waitress/grad student who knows her way around a winery. ""The pinot grape"" Miles tells Maya ""needs constant care and attention. . . . Its not a survivor."" Replies Maya ""A bottle of wine is constantly alive evolving until it peaks. Then it begins its decline."" They are of course talking about themselves dancing the awkward two-step of courtship baring bruised souls. It is a lovely moment until that is Miles breaks the spell. He wants this woman but hes terrified. Nothing much happens in this movie and then everything happens. Theres not a false note here and the entire supporting cast -- Madsen Oh Church and Marylouise Burke as Miless Mother -- is uniformly excellent. It rambles along at its own good-natured pace playing both for laughs and for laments stretching out a tad too long but who cares really? The films a welcome ramble. Giamatti as demonstrated in his attention-grabbing turn as comic-book writer Harvey Pekar in ""American Splendor"" is the master of mopes. His is a mug that registers heartbreak with a downward glance an imperceptible shift in facial musculature. His Miles is a man whose life is defined by regret a man who the audience keeps hoping will put down the wine glass and get to living. Sideways (124 minutes at Landmark Bethesda Row and Loews Georgetown) is rated R for profanity sex scenes and nudity.

Someone needs Miles (Paul Giamatti) to move his car which he has parked in an awkward spot. But more significantly this is a moral wake-up call. The rumpled depressed and extremely hung-over Miles needs to get his act together. For the time being however Miles has to take care of someone else. His old college friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church) is getting hitched and wants Miles to accompany him on a last hurrah a road trip through the Santa Ynez vineyards of California. Jack (Thomas Haden Church left) and Miles (Paul Giamatti) take one last road trip full of wine and women in the comedy ""Sideways."" (Merie W.

But no sooner are they on the road when Jack confesses his real agenda. He wants to sow his wild oats before the wedding and he wants the same for Miles whos getting over a messy divorce. Miles who was looking forward to a few days of wine drinking and golf is appalled. They couldnt be more different these two. Miles is tightly wound misanthropic and is desperately awaiting word from the publishers about his darkly convoluted first novel. Jacks gregarious to the point of goofy. Hes a sexual predator with a telegenic smile. Miles a wine connoisseur holds his pinot up to the light thrusts his nose inside the glass and takes in the bouquet. Then with great deliberation he takes a sip. Jack tips his glass vertically and chugs. (Rex Pickett the author of the book on which ""Sideways"" is based has said the difference between Miles and Jack is the difference between pinot and cabernet. The first is complicated layered and difficult. The second is hardy and easily pleasing. Jack chooses to be indiscriminating. Miles still beat up over that divorce chooses to be disappointed.) Director Payne and co-writer Jim Taylor the team that gave us ""Election"" ""Citizen Ruth"" and ""About Schmidt"" have not only made the funniest most assured film of their partnership (see Film Notes on Page 39) theyve harvested one of the most pleasurable movies of the year. The characters are so enjoyably matched youd follow their endless squabblings anywhere. Add the scenic wonders of Santa Ynez and two fiercely independent women who enter both mens lives and youve got an irresistibly potent combination. Jack sees his target almost immediately. Her name is Stephanie (Sandra Oh) and she happens to be friends with Maya (Virginia Madsen) a waitress whos been on Miless radar for quite some time; he travels through this region often and likes to stop in at her restaurant the Hitching Post. When Jack arranges a double date over dinner there are romantic stirrings all around. Its the beginning of great anticipation for everyone but also the onset of trouble. Jack ""neglects"" to mention his upcoming nuptials. And Miles sworn into silence fumes quietly while he also battles unresolved fury at his ex-wife. The women are ready for new beginnings. The guys need work. There are so many good things to point to great performances from the central foursome for starters. Oh and Madsen are terrific on screen; they bring powerful balance to this battle of genders. ""Sideways"" isnt just a road picture about two hilarious losers its a great comedy about men and women. And the conversations between them are written with affecting care and depth. Theres one particular scene between Miles and Maya when both express their delight over wine drinking that perfectly explains what kind of people they are and how they belong to each other if only Miles would get it. Giamatti is a comedic gem a walking rain cloud of despair who steals cash from his mother and refuses absolutely refuses to drink the wrong wine. Church best known for his character Lowell Mather in the television show ""Wings"" is a revelation. He turns a cad into an unforgettable and dare I say lovable rogue. Those eyes brim over equally with lust and childish innocence. When a despondent Miles tells Jack he cant even commit suicide because hes not published yet like the Hemingways of the world Jack tries his best to be helpful. The guy that wrote ""A Confederacy of Dunces"" he reminds Miles killed himself before he was published. So Miles could still. Gee thanks Jack. Payne hasnt just gone for verbal humor. There are sight gags galore. I hate to give too many away but theres one that may amuse -- and haunt -- me to my dying day Its an angry tubby and very naked man chasing after Miles and Jack brandishing his fists. Why hes so angry and what kind of trouble the two road pals just got into well youd be happier and much more amused finding out for yourself.

Starring Paul Giamatti Thomas Haden Church Virginia Madsen Sandra Oh. Directed by Alexander Payne. Written by Payne and Jim Taylor from a novel by Rex Pickett. (R. 124 minutes. At the Embarcadero.). Miles (Paul Giamatti) the protagonist of director Alexander Paynes little marvel ""Sideways"" lives in a small apartment in a motel-like complex in San Diego. Its a place for people on the way up or on the way down. Its clear which way this schlubby divorced middle-school English teacher is headed but he buffers himself with the trappings of a better life. He has finished a novel even though he acknowledges it is impenetrable. At his corner coffeehouse he orders a croissant in an accent meant to suggest a familiarity with Paris. His chief selling point is his wine expertise which allows him to speak with authority before drinking himself into oblivion. Wine lovers value balance a concept Payne director of ""Citizen Ruth"" ""Election"" and ""About Schmidt"" has mastered here. Tapping the extraordinary powers of observation he showed in previous films while lessening the farcical elements Payne reaps humor and pathos from the missteps of Miles and his boorish actor pal Jack played by Thomas Haden Church. Written by Payne and Jim Taylor from a novel by Rex Pickett ""Sideways"" mocks and loves the losers at its center. They are former college roommates on a romp through Central Coast wineries as a last hurrah before Jack marries a pretty rich woman whos too good for him. Any woman would seem too good for Jack a hopeless womanizer or for Miles who has financed the trip by swiping a roll of hundreds from his mothers stash in her chest of drawers. Their vacation is at least visually idyllic as Payne and cinematographer Phedon Papamichael offer sunlight so saturated the film sometimes resembles a commercial for a compilation CD of 1970s mellow rock. Gentle piano tinkling and split-screen imagery further suggest the 70s an era of male self- discovery and bonding in American cinema. ""Sideways"" a winking descendant of such films wraps its life lessons in buddy comedy. Their actions can be alarming but the men of ""Sideways"" possess decent qualities and are if not always sympathetic always recognizable. Church from TVs ""Wings"" and ""Ned and Stacey"" plays Jack as an unmitigated dude and a bit of a doofus but also a support to Miles. That Miles book has been passed up the editors ranks is in Jacks mind as good as it having reached bookstore shelves. He has more faith in Miles than Miles has in himself. Giamatti adding appealing new dimensions to his simmering-twerp persona brings an indulgence to scenes with Church. Miles doesnt protest too much when Jack uncorks an expensive bottle of wine and spills much of it on the floorboard of Miles aging Saab. (Drinking and driving? You bet) He explodes at Jack for talking while they play golf but he also joins him in physically threatening a group of golfers who hit into their game. The winery scenes underscore Giamattis lack of vanity. Sampling rose Miles urges Jack to really get his nose in there. He demonstrates by sticking half his face into his own glass remarking on aromas of citrus and strawberry and notes of asparagus and an obscure cheese. He is absolutely pretentious and as Giamatti plays him perfectly unaware of it. Jack doesnt get the fancy talk but hes all for Miles policy of refilling his glass when attendants turn their backs. Jack seeks female attention for himself and for his pal though the terms he actually uses are as varied as they are crude. When Jack points out that a steakhouse waitress (Virginia Madsen) has her eye on his pal Miles dismisses the idea. He knows the waitress whose name is Maya but theres nothing romantic there. ""Occasionally I have drinks with the employees"" he says with forced casualness as if dropping the name of a movie star. When she inquires about their plans for later Miles says hes bushed and is going back to their motel. Churchs face tells us Jack is the most disappointed wingman in history. Payne loves cringe-inducing moments and Giamatti handles everything he dishes out bringing unexpected nuance to a scene where Miles gets drunk and moony for his ex-wife. But ""Sideways"" also gives Giamatti something new to play romance. Miles is sincerely interested in what Maya has to say and delighted to find she can speak as eloquently as he about wine. Madsen underused by Hollywood is radiant here. Maya seems too beautiful for this guy but age can be a great equalizer. Madsen exudes an air of wisdom of having lived enough to know a smart man might work better than a handsome one. Paynes eye for detail has always been keen -- you could almost smell the mustiness on Matthew Brodericks short-sleeved dress shirts in ""Election"" -- but never this spot-on. Secondhand furniture and a first-class wine rack furnish the rustic home of a free-spirited winery worker with whom Jack cavorts (played with gusto by Sandra Oh Paynes wife) a childs artwork on the refrigerator door lending seediness to a mothers hookup with a man she just met. A Disneyfied winery complete with Mediterranean-lite decor and house guitar plucker provides a fitting setting for purist Miles to hit bottom. With four fine films under his belt Payne should be regarded as an American treasure. Yet he lacks the name recognition of contemporaries like Quentin Tarantino and Wes Anderson. Perhaps thats because Paynes imprint on his work is relatively subtle. What an Alexander Payne film leaves you with more than auteurist flourishes is a sense of life being reflected in all its shades complexities and comedy and in the case of ""Sideways"" its opportunities to let ones good qualities overwhelm the bad. -- Advisory This film contains nudity strong sexuality and profanity.

Sounds like your ordinary buddy road movie with self- discovery lurking like a state trooper around every bend. It has two chase scenes and a car crash. But the film scripted by Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor and directed by Payne is in no way ordinary. Since Miles and Jack moor in the Santa Ynez Valley to sample the local vintages its a sedentary road movie. Instead of the usual cantina of eccentrics just two significant characters cross their path Maya (Virginia Madsen) a waitress and Stephanie (Sandra Oh) a wine pourer. One other thing Sideways is by far the years best American movie. Its vigorous gracious tenderly attentive to Miles and Jacks immense flaws -- a paean to the durability of lifes losers which is to say most of us. This sunny funny trip of a film would stamp a 2-hr. smile even on Miles forlorn face. Jack and Miles are ideal opposites. Miles is nerdy and needy analyzing every sip of wine fretting over every impulse convinced that hes too insignificant a writer even to kill himself ""Hemingway Sexton Plath Woolf -- you cant commit suicide until youre published."" Jack whose fluorescent grin almost distracts from his fading good looks still believes he has It. (""I get chicks lookin at me all the time all ages. Dudes too."") With a true actors magnificent focus and minute attention span hes so in the moment than he can convince himself of anything including that a night of great sex is a cue to call off the wedding. Miles has a habit of missing the moment even when it grabs him by the hand. One evening he and Maya talk warmly about wine. He delivers his dark Pinot rhapsody; she speaks of wines as if they were people she wants to meet -- people like Miles. Its one of the most poignant falling-in-love duets in movie history with an ending so faithful to real life it could break your heart. All praise to the acuity of the actors the hilarious Church as a charmer who can intuit the flattering lies everyone wants to hear; Madsen with an intense sexy intelligence; Giamatti radiating pain and fitful star quality. His Miles keeps hurting but keeps searching; this frustrated novelist isnt looking for a big publisher so much as for a loving reader. In Maya whom he has disappointed in so many ways he may have found one. Perhaps the depressive has found a reason to hope. What is hope anyway if not knocking one last time on the door of a beautiful woman youve hurt?

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

That leaves song which places a poor third in the lives of its downtrodden protagonists -- who fortunately for us are funny and human. Go road tripping with Lowell (Wings Thomas Haden Church) and Harvey Pekear (American Splendors Paul Giamatti) in Sideways. Fox Searchlight Pictures Director/co-writer Payne with regular writing partner Jim Taylor is now an amazing 4-for-4 with his first four movies -- this atop Citizen Ruth Election and About Schmidt. Like Schmidt this adaptation of a Rex Pickett novel is a largely indoor road movie about finding oneself though in this case the central twosome isnt particularly looking. (Related video See a preview of Sideways) Because and maybe only because they were roomies at San Diego State a teacher and struggling novelist (Paul Giamattis Miles) and a fading hunk-actor (Thomas Haden Churchs Jack) elect to indulge Miles wine expertise by spending a week of grape guzzling and golfing in Californias Santa Ynez Valley. Its a prelude to Jacks imminent marriage and financial security -- which doesnt keep him from hitting on every woman in sight to the disdain of the ever-melancholy divorced Miles. About the movie Sideways     (out of four) Stars Paul Giamatti Thomas Haden Church Virginia Madsen Sandra Oh Directors Alexander Payne Distributor Fox Searchlight Rated R for language some strong sexual content and nudity. Opens Friday in select cities You wouldnt think of these guys as friends yet Jacks ""what me worry?"" persona (which makes one outburst of self-doubt doubly revealing) keenly deflects his companions doldrums. As cheating Jack cavorts with an oblivious new acquaintance (Sandra Oh) Miles fails to connect with her waitress friend (Virginia Madsen maybe her best role ever). But then lonely-guy Miles is the type who knows which issue of Barely Legal is new when hes buying it at a convenience store. Hes so hopeless that we root for him. This is a building-block movie Its stand-out excellence becomes apparent only gradually. Payne is so adept at mining quiet humor (""swinging bachelors"" watch The Grapes of Wrath in their hotel room) that we buy it when Sideways almost turns farcical in the late going because weve already invested in the characters. Giamatti had the role of a lifetime just last year in American Splendor; now he has two. And heres a splendid Church coming directly off George of the Jungle 2 and Serial Killing 4 Dummys. How many talented performers are out there looking for breaks? Sadly only a few meet up with a Payne and a Taylor whose scripts always make actors look good.

"Sideways sloshed in America. Slate Sign In Sign Up Sideways sloshed in America. Sideways sloshed in America. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 21 2004 706 PM Sloshed in America Sideways a road movie about wine addiction. By David Edelstein Drunks and disorderly As someone who frequently contemplates the pros and cons of alcohol consumption Ive wondered why no one ever talks about out-of-control epicureans--why Alcoholics Anonymous people (at least in my circles) never tell horror stories of self-destructive Chateauneuf du Pape obsessions or ridiculous 150-mile trips to taste some acclaimed brewpub India pale ale or rent monies blown on bottles of 25-year-old Springbank. I admit that doesnt sound as nightmarish as say waking up from a three-day blackout on a rooftop naked covered in vomit with a needle sticking out of one arm and two cops pointing guns. But there is a class of addicts (and not always privileged ones) for whom the epicurean drive is closely allied with the drive to self-medicate. Epicures go sideways too big time. Which brings us to Alexander Paynes Sideways (Fox Searchlight) a warm ingratiating and fitfully hilarious epicurean road movie with a steady ache--an ache like a red-wine hangover. Its about two guys Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Haden Church) who take a wine-tasting road trip the week before Jacks wedding. Closely adapted (by Payne and his partner Jim Taylor) from a novel by Los Angeles screenwriter Rex Pickett its like a gonzo teen sex comedy smacked upside the head by encroaching middle age and its attendant insults bleariness self-hatred bodies and minds that dont recover as quickly (or at all) from relentless self-abuse and the unshakable sense that as Shakespeares Richard II puts it ""I wasted time and now doth time waste me."" And yet even here there are moments of blissful connectedness fleeting ones somewhere around the second glass of that single-vineyard central coast pinot opposite someone sympathetic--moments when the wine helps to stop time soften anxiety and open up a new world of hope. Advertisement Its Miles whos the oenophile--and the alcoholic. Recently divorced still carrying a torch for his ex-wife and with an unwieldy novel making the rounds of ever-smaller publishing houses Miles has channeled a lot of his longing in the direction of pinot noir. For him its not about getting blotto (or I should say going sideways). Its about tasting the latest vintage. Its about sticking his nose in the glass smiling at the voluptuous aroma sipping chewing taking apart the flavor components and mulling over the finish. Its about holding forth pedantically until his table mates eyes glaze over. (""Citrus passion fruit just the faintest soupcon of asparagus and like a nutty Edam cheese"" is one pronouncement.) And its about working his way down to the bottom of the bottle phoning and harassing his ex and stumbling home and passing out like any other drunk. Jack is an addict too of a different sort. A washed-up television leading man with a big chest a deep tan and a can-do California disposition--quite a contrast to the paunchy morose Miles--hes an incorrigible pussy-hound. Despite his impending nuptials he makes a play for almost every woman he eyeballs and he ends up embarking on a whirligig vaguely Samp;M affair with a tasting-room employee named Stephanie (Sandra Oh). But Jack is thinking about Miles too. He encourages Miles to get cozy with Maya (Virginia Madsen) a blonde radiantly beautiful divorced waitress and horticulture grad student with an incredible wine palate (better than Miles). The fact that Miles isnt turning cartwheels the instant he connects with Maya is a mark of how depressed he really is. And the fact that she looks at him twice is a mark of-- Maybe Hollywood? Some viewers will find the attraction of Madsens Maya to Miles a little mysterious. Its not that Giamatti is totally unprepossessing--just that his intense Im-a-loser vibe and oh yes his obvious alcoholism dont exactly add up to the most promising boyfriend material. (Weve also seen him steal money from his own mother cut his toenails in close-up and do a crossword puzzle while driving.) But he has his moments. Hes charming when he celebrates the pinot noir grape in part because its so hard to grow thin-skinned temperamental early-ripening needing constant care from the most patient and nurturing of growers. You dont need a shrink to tell you that Miles has overidentified with that fragile little grape. And you dont need to be a matchmaker to see that Maya has a comparable identification She speaks lyrically of wines ephemeralness--the way it constantly evolves the way it conjures up a time and place long past. This is a lovely film--agreeably rambling. Its more even-toned and less smug I think than Paynes last road movie AboutSchmidt. Paynes framing is relaxed and spacious Nothing--not even the scene where Miles pours the contents of a tasting-room spit bucket down his throat--comes off as unduly grotesque. Well maybe that scene does but Giamatti is buoyant even when sodden and Church has a marvelous etherized sense of entitlement a spoiled optimism thats pure California. Its a joy to see Madsen a golden ingenue in the 80s who seemed permanently consigned to horror movies and made-for-cable thrillers with first-rate material--and proving that something other than wine gets better with age. As for the alcohol question its left hanging. Sideways doesnt spell out the message that Miles and Jack have to get a handle on themselves and stop disappearing sideways into their respective addictions. But that message hangs in the air--the faintest soupcon of rot in an otherwise wondrous bouquet. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

Wallace A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Theres nothing more hackneyed than comparing a persons meritorious traits to the qualities of . . . ah a fine wine. Picture a gassed-out James Lipton waxing poetic to a bored young woman on a disastrous dinner date. And yet almost miraculously director Alexander Payne and actor Paul Giamatti actually pull off a meaningful wine metaphor in Paynes newest film Sideways. As Miles a sad-sack neurotic wine connoisseur Giamatti (American Splendors suffering nonconformist antihero Harvey Pekar) timidly explains to a luminous Virginia Madsen his passion for his favorite grape pinot ""Its a hard grape to grow. Its thin-skinned temperamental. Its not a survivor like Cabernet that can grow anywhere and thrive even when neglected. Pinot needs constant care and attention."" Its an obvious line unambiguously reflecting Miles character but at the same time so painfully self-revelatory that you cant dismiss it as another dumb declaration of the aged grape. Nervous Miles is no windbag no ostentatious cork-sniffer out to impress the ladies with his knowledge. Hes just a guy who really digs wine. And as he expresses himself in this delicate moment hes in turn articulating the spirit of the film fragility amid the coarseness of life.

BY JOE DONNELLY Adapted from Rex Picketts novel of the same name Sideways has two middle-aged friends taking a sort of last-fling road trip while in the middle of their own existential life crises. Miles is a balding intelligent ill-humored (though certainly humorous) eighth-grade English teacher and struggling novelist still stinging from a 2-year-old divorce and sweating over a book he has reason to hope will be published. Jack (Wings Thomas Haden Church) is a dippy sweet craggily handsome actor whos now doing commercials and voice-over work after his stint as a soap star 10 years prior. This mismatched pair were college roommates (which is funny to imagine) and have managed to remain friends into their 40s in part because both have drifted off course albeit in different directions. They also genuinely like each other. Jack is preparing to marry his wealthy girlfriend the following weekend and to celebrate Miles is driving him through wine country. As they wind through the beautiful Santa Ynez Valley and the less-beautiful towns of Solvang and Buellton Miles casually attempts to show Jack the essentials of wine tasting. Theres fun in watching these two enjoy their bibbing -- Miles so particular in his tastes and Jack greeting his first gulp with ""Tastes pretty good to me."" But the trip isnt just for the wine. Jack has other plans. Intent upon shouting a last hurrah to singledom the smarmy charmer is looking to get laid and wishes his hangdog friend would join in the pursuit. Stopping off in Los Olivos they come to one of Miles favorite spots a restaurant called the Hitching Post wherein works the lovely middle-aged waitress Maya (Virginia Madsen). Jack quickly senses that shes ""into"" Miles and pushes his buddy to ask her out -- a course of action Miles cannot begin to fathom. But then when Jack gets involved with a sexy wine pourer (Sandra Oh) who just happens to be friends with Maya Miles finds himself on the dreaded if unexpectedly exciting double date. Though Miles hopped up on Xanax Lexapro and way too much wine on top of it reverts to type by dialing up his ex-wife halfway through the dinner he manages to make it back to the table and remain conscious enough to begin falling for the soulful Maya. She as it happens is also getting over a messy divorce. Even better she loves wine as much as Miles does.   Before your mind starts drifting to movies like Sleepless in Seattle or the Nicholson-Keaton creaker Somethings Gotta Give know that Payne and co-scripter Jim Taylor have more than romance on their minds. Taking a step away from the quirky love story Sideways smartly and at times hilariously keeps reverting back to Miles and Jack as they plow through more countryside plunging into a number of personal sinkholes along the way. After picking up another girl -- in this case a fleshy waitress from a Sizzler-style restaurant -- Jack tells an agitated Miles ""There are some things I have to do that you dont understand. You understand wine and literature and movies . . . but you dont understand my plight."" Whats so terrific about this moment is that Jack is being totally sincere and totally stupid all at once. And when his horn-dog proclivities -- and perhaps more tellingly his fear of commitment coupled with a colossal case of adult attention deficit disorder -- lead to a chain of catastrophes and a mini-mental breakdown well of course he had it coming. Like Miles though we feel his pain. A trenchant American satirist in his previous films Payne moves in a different direction with Sideways -- one less mordant but just as pointedly observant. As in About Schmidt Payne is alert to both the beauty of the American landscape and the trashiness of American life. He understands both the humor and the pathos of chain restaurants and tract homes. Like Schmidt Payne lingers in spaces long enough for us to gather some clues about a character (think of Schmidt checking out his future son-in-laws bedroom with its wall of underachievement). In Sideways youll see Miles mother bustling about her tacky condo in Oxnard with its glass case of Hummel figurines (more shades of About Schmidt) and in the films most disgustingly riotous scene the trashed-out abode of Jacks illicit waitress a place that looks like it was ransacked during a visit by TVs Cops. Like the easy-growing Cabernets and the common Merlots Miles so despises (""If anyone orders Merlot Im leaving"" he shouts before he and Jack meet up with their dinner dates) America expands with thick hearty and mostly uninspired ugliness while delicate people like Miles dwell along the fringes. Much like Steve Buscemis put-upon record collector Seymour in Terry Zwigoffs Ghost World a guy who confesses his inability to relate to ""98 percent of humanity"" Miles hasnt given up entirely but is so accustomed to failure that not a day is met without its bringing some kind of abject humiliation. As with Jack rather than simply laughing at Miles tribulations Payne and Giamatti flesh out the human being whos enduring them. Working off the talents of Church and Madsen (whose steadying yet vulnerable presence is garnering much welcome-back buzz) Giamatti in particular takes us so far into Miles that we never see the freak-outs coming. Though perfectly twitchy and curmudgeonly theres very little shtick to Giamattis characterization Miles is too layered and interesting and passionate to be merely pathetic. And while he may not have an actual cellar he does have a stash of impressive vintages in the hall closet of his low-rent San Diego apartment. When Miles crouches down on his hands and knees in the shag-carpeted hallway to pull a particular bottle from that closet were being set up for a subtle and emblematic instance of Alexander Paynes art in which we discover in a pensive private moment of simultaneous heartbreak and personal triumph that theres more to this awkward guy and his obsessions than initially meets the eye. By simply living in the morass of daily existence while keeping his passions intact Miles has become by the end a kind of hero.

"Sideways | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; sideways ) Sideways (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli Sideways is from Alexander Payne (Election About Schmidt) whose films simultaneously satirize and observe life in America. Unlike David Lynch who uses saws and butcher knives to dissect the American dream Payne prefers a scalpel. Lynch often ridicules his characters (and sometimes the audience) but its clear that Payne likes the individuals he uses to populate his films even though theyre not always the nicest of people. Sideways looks at one of the oldest and oddest of ""civilized"" conventions the bachelor party. Using this as a springboard the movie becomes about friendship love sex and wine. There are no big A-list stars although the quality of the acting is of the highest caliber. The leads are played by character actors Paul Giamatti (as Miles) and Thomas Hayden Church (as Jack). These two are best friends who take a one-week road trip to Californias wine country to celebrate Jacks upcoming wedding. Their plans are to spend their days tasting wine and playing golf. But an itch in Jacks pants gets in the way. He wants to have a last fling and he targets the feisty Stephanie (Sandra Oh) - except he neglects to mention that hes not looking for a long-term commitment. While Jack is romping with Stephanie Miles tentatively tries to set something up with her friend Maya (Virginia Madsen) a waitress with whom he has had prior contact. This is really Miles story. Hes a sad-sack loser who has written an unpublishable novel mourns his failed marriage and has obvious self-esteem problems. Despite the mans party-pooping attitude a lot of us will see something of ourselves in Miles and thats what makes it oh-so-easy to identify with him. He embodies many of the flaws of the human experience but he is also capable of kindness and honesty and one gets the sense that hes a survivor (although life for him is not a happy journey). Giamatti is great in the part. He has the face and the mannerisms down pat. His supporting cast - Church Madsen and Oh - are equally well selected. In Sideways Payne holds true to the form he displayed in his previous movies. The drama is leavened nicely with humor. There are plenty of so-called ""big laugh"" moments. None of the comedy seems forced or ill-timed which is a key to material being fun in a picture like this. Even the ""golf course battle"" which gets the biggest laughs is plausible (at least based on my limited experience on courses). Theres also quite a bit of wine-related humor; this obviously comes from a man who has knowledge about the subject. After leaving Sideways I actually believed I had learned a little about wine and wine-producing grapes. But thats a fringe benefit. The real strengths of Sideways are the characters it develops the road trip it takes us on and the laughs with which it provides along the way. Overall how does this compare to Paynes previous two movies? Its not as openly satirical as Election and is a little less bleak than About Schmidt. The characters in Sideways are better developed than those in the earlier films the poignancy is just as forceful as it was in About Schmidt and the comedy is slightly better integrated. In my opinion this is Paynes finest movie to-date. It is a little on the long side (slightly over two hours) but the minutes fly by. Its likely that 2004 wont offer a better movie about a mid-life crisis.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

This review was updated on Sept. 15 2004 Moving away from his native Nebraska for the first time onto what proves to be even more fertile soil in the wine country of Californias central coast Alexander Payne has single-handedly restored humanism as a force in American films in ""Sideways."" A beautifully observed small-scale study of personal foibles romantic uncertainty and two sides of the sadly predictable male animal this appealingly handcrafted film will appeal most directly to the more upscale and discerning end of the audience spectrum. But the picture features enough flat-out hilarity that given the right push from Fox Searchlight and some luck in the bargain it could catch on with a larger public. Much of what has gone so right with ""Sideways"" can be gleaned from the way it was cast. After Paynes success with Jack Nicholson in ""About Schmidt"" the director could have gone the big star route The two leads as well as the two smaller but important female characters are juicy roles. Instead Payne went the opposite way selecting non-box office names who happen to be perfect for the parts and in the process has provided significant evidence for the argument that casting can rep 90% of what it takes to make a good movie. Paul Giamatti of course made a significant breakthrough in ""American Splendor"" but one doesnt expect to see him in leading-man roles every year. A far less likely prospect despite his weathering good looks was Thomas Haden Church. Who ever expected the co-star of TVs ""Wings"" and ""Ned and Stacey"" to suddenly emerge as a riotous presence in a top indie-flavored picture? Then theres former B movie sexpot Virginia Madsen who here emerges from perhaps a decade of obscurity to deliver one of the great monologues in modern cinema. Sandra Oh has her cult following but few directors other than Payne her husband would likely have had the insight to cast her as a Santa Barbara County lust object. The premise of the script by Payne and his usual collaborator Jim Taylor working from Rex Picketts novel couldnt be simpler. Miles (Giamatti) a sad-sack English teacher and would-be novelist who still hasnt recovered from being dumped by his wife intends to take his former college roommate over-the-hill hunky actor Jack (Church) on a weeklong trip through the Santa Ynez Valley prior to Jacks wedding skedded for the following weekend. Its the Odd Couple on the road. Miles envisions a week touring the wineries and restaurants beyond Santa Barbara with perhaps some rounds of golf while Jack is bent on getting both of them laid. Although their college years are about 20 years behind them neither has progressed much; Miles has a failed marriage and unpublished novel to his credit while Jack about to be married for the first time has been reduced to acting in the odd TV commercial. These are men who if they met today would likely never become friends but they bonded in immaturity and share the same today. Driving the car and the agenda is Miles who has become a self-styled wine snob deeply into pinots while anything tastes good to Jack. After a pit stop at the home of Miles mother (an enthusiastic Marylouise Burke) the pair roll into Buellton for Sunday dinner at the Hitching Post where Miles knows attractive waitress Maya (Madsen). Jack urges his buddy to make a move for her but Miles demurs. Next day at a winery Jack flirts with lively pourer Stephanie (Oh) who turns out to be Mayas close friend and a double date is arranged. So starts several days of misadventures missed opportunities and deceptions that see Jack and Stephanie immediately diving into a lusty affair (with Stephanie knowing nothing of his impending wedding) while Miles tortured shyness prevents him from taking advantage of numerous openings Maya gives him. A long stretch of the film has Miles and the audience writhing in comic anxiety as he consistently fails to summon up the courage to kiss Maya forcing them instead into further levels of interesting but procrastinating dialogue. Miles holds forth about his novel as well as the endless subtleties of wine. But when its Mayas turn she simply and eloquently expresses in emotional terms why she loves wine how its a living entity to her and how it expresses its own creation and history to her when she drinks it. Its a marvelously written speech and Madsen delivers it with a sincerity and sensitivity that is extraordinary to behold. In a funk after learning his manuscript has been rejected by the last house considering it Miles contemplates killing himself but concludes ""I cant commit suicide before Ive published anything."" He also lets slip about Jacks wedding news of which gets back to Stephanie who reacts in an amazing way. Jacks final sexual prank with an overweight waitress results in an uproarious close call for both men before they return to Los Angeles for the wedding which holds a poignant encounter for Miles. ""Sideways"" is a wonderful film so accomplished that it looks effortless. In his fourth feature Payne has refined his simple but eloquent style to the point where it serves the material fully without an ounce of ostentation. He is also happy to place the actors front and center and all four respond with exceptional performances that give innumerable emotional contours to their recognizable but highly individualized characters. Giamatti holds the compulsively depressive Miles up to the light for inspection at every possible angle making what could have been a tiresome bore into a loser one can still root and hope for. Church miraculously manages to make one laugh both with and at the hopelessly sex-minded Jack without condescending to him for a moment. Madsen makes Maya into an ideal woman in many ways without idealizing her and Oh is simply a gas. Mellow mood is fostered by a lovely jazz score by Rolfe Kent that helps the poignancy and humor of the story ebb flow and intermingle with surpassing ease.
