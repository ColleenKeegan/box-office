His children prefer their mom reliable protective Jackie (Sarandon). She isnt too keen on her replacement either but shes dying from cancer. Its hard not to feel like a puppet while watching this - at every moment theres a cold hand prodding you into laughter or tears. Director Chris Columbus has been doing this for years and as conservative propaganda goes (the message is good mums sacrifice all for their kids) its as smooth as butter. The cast are more than adequate. Sarandon ennobles the dumbest of lines - contorting that intelligently clownish face into a million expressions of hurt - and Roberts does her urban-girl schtick to perfection.

Starring Julia Roberts Susan Sarandon Ed Harris and Jena Malone. Directed by Chris Columbus. (PG-13. 127 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Ive never been able to figure out why there are so many movies about serial killers and Mafia drug lords but so few about characters in situations that audiences actually might be able to relate to. Take couples going through a divorce and its wrenching aftermath. Thats almost half the population but youd never know it from the dearth of films on the subject. ""Stepmom"" opening today gets points simply for depicting what its like to have to reconfigure a family after a divorce. With Julia Roberts in the title role Susan Sarandon as the mom and Ed Harris as the lucky dog who gets both of them (albeit at different times) this blended family may be more glamorous than most. But their pain and the generosity of spirit they show trying to do the best for their kids seem real. The film shows the sure hand of San Francisco director Chris Columbus who made divorce seem funny in ""Mrs. Doubtfire."" In ""Stepmom"" he brings a life- threatening illness into the equation. The result is a film thats sad and poignant but not without humorous moments. The heartfelt story is credited to Gigi Levangie who apparently became a stepmother under circumstances similar to those in the movie. Jackie (Sarandon) and Isabel (Roberts) probably would never have met if Isabel hadnt moved in with Jackies ex Luke (Harris). Isabel is a big-time New York photographer with underlings to cart around her equipment. Jackie stays home in suburban New York with her adolescent daughter Anna (Jena Malone) and 7-year-old son Ben (Liam Aiken). The women barely tolerate each other. Isabel thinks Jackie is spoiling the children. Jackie is fearful every time they stay over with their father because she has no confidence in Isabels ability to care for them. When Anna asks her mother whether Isabel is successful Jackie replies ""People like Isabel who think only about themselves often do make a lot of money."" All this changes when Isabel discovers that Jackie has cancer which she has kept secret from everyone. ""Stepmom"" changes tone at this point becoming less strident and more gentle as the two try out the idea of being friends. Sarandon has a facility for playing earth mothers as she showed in ""Little Women"" and ""Lorenzos Oil."" Her scenes with the child actors are magical; its as if they really are kin. The surprise is just how good Roberts is. Ridding herself of her cutesy mannerisms she gives the deepest performance of her career. Harris usually a fine actor is less than stellar though the fault seems to be more with how his character was written than with him. Luke is supposed to be a loving dad yet hes never around at critical times. Hes really more of a prop an excuse to bring the two women together. The filmmakers play fast and loose with geography. Isabel often gets called while on a photo shoot to pick up her stepkids. She arrives in record time although the distance must be dozens of miles and she has to negotiate Manhat tan traffic. But this is a small quibble about a movie that does so much right. ""Stepmom"" is a perfect holiday picture. Its uplifting and reaffirming about the virtues of all families including stepfamilies.

D+ Jack Frost Genre Sci-fi and Fantasy Drama; Starring Michael Keaton Kelly Preston Joseph Cross; Director Troy Miller; Author Mark Steven Johnson; Release Date Wide 12/11/1998; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted January 8 1999 -- 1200 AM EST In the beginning Stepmom plays like a broad catfight sitcom in which Jackie (Susan Sarandon) who got the large tasteful suburban house and joint custody of the kids in the divorce settlement regularly bad-mouths and sabotages Isabel (Julia Roberts) the groovy younger career woman who shares a downtown-loft bed with Luke (Ed Harris) Jackies ex. Some catfight. Some broads. Isabel is a fashion photographer who demonstrates shes brilliant at her job by snapping the shutter three times then declaring the assignment done and shows that shes terrible with children by oversleeping when she should be getting angry 12-year-old Anna (Jena Malone) and scampish 7-year-old Ben (Liam Aiken) ready for school. The kids enjoy giving Isabel a hard time partly because theyre loyal to their mother (""Mommy if you want me to hate her I will"" Ben offers) and partly I assume because they hate that their fathers new girlfriend owns so many cute hats. Director Chris Columbus whose talent for creating decorative gingerbread-house domestic comedies benefited Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire takes an awful lot of pleasure in the girl-girl competition encouraging the worst in Sarandon and Roberts Older and younger movie star snipe and glare at each other with little subtlety and little chemistry either. The two characters appear to be skirmishing only because theyre supposed to by convention; left unbothered by a speechy pronouncement-filled script it took five writers to assemble they probably would have little use for each other. (Harris Luke having established himself as a man in touch with his feelings but understandably afraid of being bitch-slapped sits most of the story out.) Stepmom takes a serious turn for the mawkish though when Jackie is hit with cancer -- what kind we dont know only that ""its spread"" and thats very very bad. (""But I did everything right"" she wails.) The movie trailer lets on nothing about this arbitrary very very sad development I know. But its important to report at the very least to help ticket buyers decide whether another dying-mom tear tweezer -- coming so soon after motherly Meryl Streep sickened in One True Thing and arriving 15 years after motherly Debra Winger expired during the holiday release of Terms of Endearment -- fits in with year-end entertainment plans. Even moviegoers looking for catharsis meanwhile may well question why Stepmom requires Jackie to hide the state of her health from her kids or her ex for so long. That selfish action is an unlikely F-- you to the people she loves engineered entirely (and unfairly) so that Isabel can be the one to discover the truth and ease the way for girl-girl reconciliation. (""Youre Mother Earth incarnate"" Isabel sighs. ""I have [the childrens] past and you have their future"" Jackie recites.) By then its Christmastime and while she looks nowhere near death Jackie more or less bids a fond farewell to everyone probably so she wont have to put on white powder and red eye shadow like Streep did recently in a movie that compared with this lab-engineered weepie is the soul of realism.

"Stepmom (PG-13) Related Item ""Stepmom"" showtimes Stepmom By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 25 1998 Julia Roberts is the ""Stepmom"" who will be taking over the parenting role for Susan Sarandon. (Columbia) Director Chris Columbus Cast Susan Sarandon; Julia Roberts; Ed Harris; Jena Malone; Liam Aiken; Lynn Whitfield; Darrell Larson; Mary Louise Wilson; Jason Maves Running Time 2 hours 5 minutes Contains sexual innuendo and the intensity of a family health crisis If the fawning movies about the problems of the extremely prosperous set your teeth on edge its probably best to avoid ""Stepmom."" Its about wealthy people who get all tangled up in their emotions but for the longest time seems like a tour of two of Martha Stewarts nicer abodes a beautifully restored turn-of-the-century farmhouse just north of Manhattan and a many-vaulted ultra-chicly decorated loft in SoHo. The abodes symbolize the two women in the life of lawyer Luke Harrison (Ed Harris); in his old home he was married to Jackie (Susan Sarandon) and the father of two adorable kids; now divorced and living in his new home he is partnered up with much younger fashion photographer Isabel Kelly (Julia Roberts). For a long time the film is a vaguely comic riff on the problems of kids-as-ping-pong-balls as the children (Jena Malone and Liam Aiken) get bounced back and forth between domiciles and a mother who loves them and a stepmom who doesnt know what to do with them. Nobody is happy but everybody manages to come up with a quip three times a minute. Sometimes you wonder Are Sarandon and Roberts in the same movie? It doesnt feel that way because Sarandons performance is brittle neurotic and cramped by gritty reality. Meanwhile Roberts is spinning around in a little fantasy world in a thinly imagined version of the fashion business that never for a moment convinces. The issues turn serious when A) Luke decides to formalize his relationship by marrying Isabel and B) Jackie develops lymphatic cancer that seems clearly terminal. Fortunately the film never turns into a disease-of-the-week thing as Sarandon in another of her patented strong woman roles keeps the boo-hooing to a minimum and sets out to oversee the orderly transfer of mothers duty from herself to her replacement. The movie seems to illustrate a peculiar fantasy of the late 90s however; where once movies idealized perfect marriages now they idealize perfect divorces. That seems to be the direction this one is heading as it chronicles the growth of Sarandons acceptance until shes finally able to make peace with the situation shes handed. Its not without moments of wit and powerful emotion but somehow ""Stepmom"" never feels either real enough to move us deeply or bubbly enough to make us forget our woes.

Chris Columbus ""Stepmom"" -- which was written in Hollywood tag-team fashion by Gigi Levangie Jessie Nelson Steven Rogers Karen Leigh and Ron Bass -- is one of those movies thats so meticulously designed to be a hit its failure at the box office could well have signaled the end of the free market system as we know it. Starring Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon as a couple of women who fight for the hearts and minds of Sarandons offspring after she divorces her husband ""Stepmom"" pushes more buttons than your average space shuttle crew. Its a ""hit"" in the sense that its made a lot of money but not in the sense that its particularly good; although by now most people have given up expecting hit movies to be good. You gotta cover a broad demographic if you want to compete with all the other Christmas movies so ""Stepmom"" can be described in a number of supposedly alluring ways each of which has been proven in the past to put fannies in the seats ... except of course when it doesnt Theatrical preview for ""Stepmom"" Windows Media 28k or 56k Real 28k or 56k Its a star vehicle Part I For whatever reason Julia Roberts cant miss. Shes very pretty in a goofy girl-behind-the-counter kind of way smiles with every bit as much verve as Tom Cruise does and (like any big movie star) is willing to do basically anything to peddle her movies to everybody on Earth. So that means that millions of people (whove been inundated with posters fashion spreads gossip items print interviews TV interviews and high-profile celebrity dating binges) would crawl across broken glass to see her be Julia Roberts in virtually anything. So Julia Roberts is in ""Stepmom."" Its a star vehicle Part II - Susan Sarandon by movie industry standards anyway is an older woman but bankably so. Shes funny smart attractive and fairly recently won an Oscar. Like Roberts she promotes the hell out of her projects and as a bonus is something of an outspoken political activist. People who like a little more meat (both physically and mentally) on their movie stars love Susan Sarandon; they cant get enough of her. So Susan Sarandon is in ""Stepmom."" Its a romance Roberts plays a commercial photographer whos living with her boyfriend and his two kids. Shes not much in the mothering department being more concerned with her glamorous career than child-rearing and shes forever forgetting to do Mom things like picking up the urchins after school. Roberts and Sarandon hate each other and the young daughter hates Roberts too for good measure. (Shes okay but - sniffle-sniffle - shes not my Mom) However when Roberts and Ed Harris (who plays the ex-husband) are alone together the John Williams score gets about as gooey as Quaker State 40-weight. This cues them to say cute smoochy things to each other just as it cues the audience to expect them to say cute smoochy things to each other. The contrived way that Harris gives Roberts an engagement ring is ridiculous so its almost guaranteed to make half of America go ""AWWWWWWWW."" Its a ""Womens Film"" Ive never bought into this concept but I only believe in Santa Claus. Womens Films when you get right down to it are movies that star women rather than men. Maybe its true that some men wont go see a movie in which the lead character is a woman but you could just as easily call them Non-Intimidated Mens Movies. Lots of guys will see them with no coercion whatsoever. Regardless the script endlessly debates (in easy-to-grasp boldface) child-rearing techniques and the intricacies of the mom-child bond all the while making damn sure that the debaters have sexy aerobicised chassis. Theoretically speaking the debate brings in the women and bone-headed guys come along for the skirts. In ""Stepmom"" one skirts older and one skirts younger just to be safe. Its a tearjerker Sarandon finds out that shes dying of cancer but shes doing her best not to tell anybody. That way she can have all kinds of moving conversations with her un-knowing children and she and Roberts can wind up forming an ""unexpected"" connection thatll benefit little Cindy and Biff (or whatever their names are) long after Mom has drifted off to blockbuster heaven. Ill give Columbus a lot of credit for not going insane with this idea but there are still moments when you can practically feel the movie putting its foot against your face for leverage as it yanks at your ducts. People love to cry at movies where honorable women develop terminal illnesses even one as endlessly cranky as Sarandons character. So Sarandon develops a terminal illness in ""Stepmom."" You also get an aggravating performance from Jenna Malone who plays the daughter as if pouting were the same thing as breathing. Im sure it wasnt the goal but she winds up making a very solid argument for corporal punishment. Everybody learns to love each other by singing Motown tunes together and as a living breathing cherry on top Roberts gives the kids a cute puppy. I hate to say it but a TV movie filled with big stars and lots of expensive crane shots is still a TV movie. So why buy a ticket? ""Stepmom"" handles Sarandons cancer fairly sensitively but everything else is delivered via mallet. Lyn Whitfield whos an extremely talented actress is given the thankless role of Sarandons doctor. Its nice that she got a paycheck but this woman deserves to star in a challenging film. Rated PG-13 for a little bit of language. 124 minutes. (Youd think incidentally that commercial film makers could find a way to suggest warmth without blasting another damn Motown song.)

Tears are jerked with strenuously sincere calculation in ""Stepmom"" which sees some very talented thesps working over the most mawkish conventions as if they were freshly minted. The combined efforts of five screenwriters ensured that not a single cliche of the modern feel-good tragic melodrama genre has gone unturned resulting in a soggy heart-tugger that will be last on any guys Christmas want-see list but will attract and connect with more than enough women to make it a solid hit. All the boomer-friendly elements are here The warmly upscale Manhattan and Hudson Valley abodes the ever-perplexing conflict between super-momdom and nifty career the adorably smart kids tossed about by divorce the lack of any money problems the middle-aged dad angst-ridden over having dumped same-aged wife for hot young babe and a deux ex machina in the form of a fatal disease that triggers some noble suffering and emotional focusing all around. Every choice in the too-many-cooks script and Chris Columbus direction is the obvious one. Isabel (Julia Roberts) is a New York fashion photographer dazzling enough to be on the other side of the camera but apparently so fabulously talented that she can dash off her shoots in three minutes flat. Having just moved into the apartment of b.f. Luke Harrison (Ed Harris) she is instantly saddled with his kids one weekend a prospect that doesnt thrill burgeoning teen Anna (Jena Malone). Even less thrilled is Lukes ex-wife Jackie (Susan Sarandon) a suburban supermom who finds Lukes new woman impossibly young self-involved and clueless about kids while Isabel not unjustifiably finds her ""imperious."" Typical of the films contrivances is a faux suspense sequence awash in jittery camerawork and anxious music in which Isabel loses track of seven-year-old Ben (Liam Aiken) on an outing in Central Park. Luke has to soothe a lot of feelings and unruffle many feathers on both sides as the contretemps continues; no matter what Isabel does to show herself a capable mom-to-be its never enough for Jackie who would like to pretend she doesnt have a chink in her Mother Earth armor. But 40 minutes in when Jackie is called into her doctors office and intones ""Its spread?"" it quickly dawns that the movie has a ""Terms of Endearment""/""One True Thing"" destination in mind one of cloying sentimentality to be arrived at with clear if teary eyes at Christmastime. The emotional breakthroughs come in stages of course. Anna who experiences her first little romance during the course of the action comes to decide that she can accept Isabel as a cool big sister; Luke proves his worth by proposing to Isabel and winning Jackies approval as ""a great father"" and the two women finally bond in a weepy way that will have susceptible members of the audience sniffling and blubbering. Pic is presented in a way that allows no painful feelings to linger for more than a moment better that the air should be cleared by bits of greeting card wisdom and characters often implausible changes of heart. The actors take it all with the utmost gravity with Sarandon playing ""Mother Earth incarnate"" to the hilt Roberts in essentially a secondary part trying to let a serious side poke through her breezily photogenic exterior and Harris lending stalwart support. Everything about the film suggests that its makers consider it a deep emotionally probing drama but its merely a soap opera with elevated production values and a sterling cast.

"Stepmom | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; stepmom ) Stepmom (United States 1998) A movie review by James Berardinelli Stepmom is the kind of bad movie that can be blamed on just about everyone involved except perhaps the actors. Theres nothing wrong with any of the performances although theyre wasted in the service of inferior material. The script is a mishmash of clichA(c)s inferior melodrama and howlingly embarrassing dialogue and the director Chris Columbus shows no evidence that he understands the meaning of the term ""subtle."" This is the kind of tearjerker that will cause audience members to cry but only because they paid hard-earned money to see it. Admittedly the premise - Dads new girlfriend trying to bond with his hostile kids - doesnt sound promising but there is room to work for screenwriters willing to take a few chances. However instead of taking those chances to come up with something genuinely affecting the small army of authors (five are credited) chose instead to develop a story that is disjointed overly-sentimental and boring. I question why would anyone want to see this movie when there are almost certainly a half-dozen better films unspooling in the same multiplex. Stepmom has a pretty good cast. Given the right project and a director who cares about getting the best out of her Julia Roberts can be a fine actress. Susan Sarandon has won a much-deserved Oscar. And Ed Harris is always likable and reliable whether hes appearing in a modern epic like Apollo 13 or an excruciatingly dumb comedy like Milk Money. But even the best performers in the world couldnt do much with this material. In fact if the actors werent well-respected I wouldnt have felt so embarrassed for them as they recited lines that no one should be forced to speak. Story wise things arent all that complicated. Luke (Ed Harris) is a successful businessman whose frequent travel contributed to the disintegration of his first marriage. Isabel (Julia Roberts) is his new much younger girlfriend and she has recently moved in with him. His ex-wife Jackie (Susan Sarandon) doesnt like Isabel and the two children she shares with Luke Anna (Jena Malone who played the young Jodie Foster character in Contact) and Ben (Liam Aiken) have adopted her position. No matter how hard Isabel tries she cant alleviate the friction. Even bribes dont work. The situation could seemingly go on like this indefinitely but two events shatter the status quo Luke asks Isabel to marry him and Jackie learns that she has potentially-fatal cancer. Suddenly the pressures on for everyone to learn to get along. In the past director Chris Columbus has displayed an aptitude for light fare. After all he was at the helm for two of the highest-grossing comedies of all time Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire. But when it comes to drama he is (and always has been) out of his depth. His direction is heavy-handed and relies largely upon crass overt manipulation. A blinking neon sign in the background reading ""CRY"" would have been more likely to provoke an emotional response than Columbus methods. As I mentioned earlier in this review the dialogue is atrocious. Most movies have a few bad lines sprinkled throughout but in Stepmom every bit of speech falls into one of three categories (1) the kinds of things people would never say in real life (2) the kinds of things people always say in movies or (3) both. For example when Jackie announces that she has cancer one characters instant sensitive reaction is to ask ""Are you dying?"" Another in full wailing-and-gnashing-of-teeth mode moans ""It should have been me instead of you."" Weve never heard that one before right? Stepmom is meant to be heartwarming but gut-wrenching is a better description. Cant someone tell a story like this without resorting to the old standby of one character catching a terminal disease? Some will doubtlessly complain that since Im a male I dont ""get"" this kind of womans movie. Such an unfounded comment is really the last line of defense for anyone desperate to excuse a pathetic attempt at drama. Next to Stepmom Terms of Endearment (another movie that pulls out the dying-of-cancer plot device) looks reserved. So unless youre addicted to bad movies have a crush on Roberts Sarandon or Harris or want to compound your holiday indigestion give Stepmom a wide berth.
