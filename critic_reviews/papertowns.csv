Entertainment ""Paper Towns"" Almost Makes A Good Point About Manic Pixie Dream Girls The latest John Green adaptation is too nice for its own good. WARNING SPOILERS WITHIN Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Cara Delevingne and Nat Wolff in Paper Towns. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation ID 6365056 Paper Towns is too nice. And that is coincidentally also the problem its hero has been facing. Quentin Jacobsen (Nat Wolff) is a rule-abiding straight-A student so worried about coloring outside the lines that his own teacher rolls his eyes when he brings up a missed quiz assuring the kid that hell still be able to become a doctor without it. Q as his friends call him is well-behaved to the point of timidity and hes constantly reminded of his own meekness by the presence of his next-door neighbor Margo Roth Spiegelman whos like Ferris Bueller in the body of model and actress Cara Delevingne. Or at least thats how he sees her. Paper Towns the second movie adaptation of a John Green novel circles around a excellent point Its neither fair nor healthy to idealize someone as the solution to your own problems. It is in theory about the shittiness of turning someone into your manic pixie dream girl except in practice it never quite makes it there. Q has been manic-pixie-dream-girling the hell out of Margo from afar since they were kids seeing in her the freedom and adventurousness he lacks. She is in his own voiceovered words his ""miracle"" his portion of the dose of magic that he believes everyone is due in their lives. Maybe they havent spoken for nine years but hes pined for her from across the street as shes established herself at the top of their high school food chain a larger-than-life figure who rumor has it once ran off and joined a circus and who toured for weeks with a band. When she dips back into his life for a night then runs away again he becomes convinced that she wants him to join her. ID 6362729 View this image > Wolff and Delevingne in Paper Towns. Michael Tackett / Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation ID 6365088 Theres no way to get into this without spoilers so -- spoilers Margo does not want him to join her. She actually hasnt been giving him much thought at all. Shes a teenager with problems of her own prone to using people and possessed with a flair for drama. But the way that Q is forced to come to terms with this unromantic truth is so sadly soft-pedaled onscreen that it feels more like an apology than a realization. Part of the problem with Paper Towns which was directed by Jake Schreier (Robot amp; Frank) and adapted by The Fault In Our Stars screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber is Delevingne whos not yet strong enough an actor to convincingly portray the moment she snaps from dream to real-live girl in Qs view -- shes never more than an abstract. Where Margo has ended up raises so many questions that go unanswered about where and how shes living and that adds to the sense of unreality that lingers around the character. But the bigger issue is that Paper Towns feels afraid to put Q through any pain. Its dramas are incredibly mild certainly compared to the terminal illness tragedies of The Fault In Our Stars but also on the standard teen movie scale. Q and his friends Ben (Austin Abrams) and Radar (Justice Smith) are such good kids that they can take off for an impromptu multi-state road trip with no apparent parental complaints. Greens writing of teenage characters at their best and their more melodramatic (like the speech in which we first hear the term in the title) remains painfully believable but in this movie incarnation the stakes of the story seem incredibly low. Its hard not to feel that the lesson Qs learned is more ""live a little"" rather than ""girls are people too."" Margo may not be the outsize character of his dreams but shes still just there to help a guy out.

Comments Paper Towns Rated PG-13  109 minutes  2015 This ambitious teenpic begins in the vein of Ferris Buellers Day Off as a rebellious high school senior (Cara Delevingne) recruits the shy boy next door (Nat Wolff) to join her in a night of mischief around suburban Orlando. Later she runs away from home and the film becomes a mystery the boy tracking down clues to her destination. Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber adapted a young adult novel by John Green and like their previous adaptations The Spectacular Now and The Fault in Our Stars this is sensitive and often winning in its depiction of adolescent behavior; the characters speak openly about their vulnerabilities which makes them sympathetic. Director Jake Schreier (Robot amp; Frank) sets a dreamy tone shooting much of the action at night or in dim spaces to capture the allure of the unknown.

"Paper Towns | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; paper-towns ) Paper Towns (United States 2015) July 24 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Paper Towns is the third coming-of-age story to reach screens during the summer of 2015 following in the wake of the vastly superior Me and Earl and the Dying Girl and Dope. Based on the novel by John Green Paper Towns is an exercise in artifice. The contrived storyline offers little opportunity for characters to grow and the meandering narrative trajectory and anticlimactic ending will have some viewers wondering why they bothered. Coming-of-age stories work best when they are populated with relatable characters. In Paper Towns the narrator and protagonist Quentin (Nat Wolff) is grounded but uninteresting. He is defined by a single personality trait his conformity. Hes a studious guy who gets good grades never cuts class and doesnt sneak out of his house at night. He is seduced out of his cocoon by the girl across the street. Shes Margo (Cara Delevingne) one of the most popular girls in school and Quentins private obsession. Like Quentin Margo isnt a real person - shes a wafer-thin movie confection defined exclusively by her free-spiritedness. Since Paper Towns is presented from Quentins perspective its understandable that Margo would be so poorly drawn (were seeing her as he sees her not as she is). Its less explicable why the same is true of Quentin. The movie opens with an interminable 30 minute setup. For about half that time we are treated to glimpses of Quentin and Margos childhood as they grow up as best friends. (Their differences are italicized in a scene where they are shown bicycling side-by-side with him wearing a helmet and her without one.) Through this Nat Wolff provides a voiceover talking about how invigorating it was to be around Margo but how in the end they drifted apart.  Then one night a few weeks before the Senior Prom she hijacks him to be her accomplice on an ""adventure"" that includes a series of revenge-fueled pranks. After that she disappears but leaves behind a series of clues for amateur sleuth Quentin to piece together. In order to find the love of his life he must leave his comfort zone even going so far as to skip school and embark on a 1200-mile road trip. Theres a saying about road trip movies that the journey not the destination matters. In Paper Towns the journey is dramatically inert - an empty half-hour comprised of minor misadventures and inane chatter among the five friends in the car. The movies final act is disappointing. I admire what the film is trying do with respect to defying conventions but the means to achieve this are awkward. After sitting through about 95 minutes one deserves a little more than sermonizing about what it means to grow up. Wolff who was fine in The Fault in Our Stars (last years Green adaptation) shows little in the way of emotion or range here. Its hard to say whether the blame lies with the actor (and by extension director Jake Schreier) or with the character. Quentin is dull and his development as a person seems more cosmetic than organic. Has he really changed? British model Cara Delevingne imbues Margo with an intriguing quirkiness but shes not on screen long enough to make more than a fleeting impression and she and Wolff share no chemistry. The actors who portray Quentins friends and traveling companions are as forgettable as the characters they play. Paper Towns is perhaps best viewed as a flight of fancy. Thats the only way to overcome the ""suspension of disbelief""curve. Little of what happens in the movie - either during the initial night adventure the subsequent investigation or the road trip - could happen in the real world so we must assume this is a parallel universe where adults are as relevant and intelligible as those in a Charlie Brown cartoon. This is after all a movie about teenagers. Why clutter it up with old people? To an extent Paper Towns is all about perspective. Seen through the eyes of Quentin this is the story of how a boy trapped by his own fears and insecurities learns to break free as a result of his single-minded pursuit of love. A different but no less valid point-of-view might argue that this about how a boy driven by an unhealthy obsession for a girl acts recklessly and irresponsibly (nearly causing death or injury to five people) in his stalking of her. A better more self-aware movie (consider The Spectacular Now also written by the duo of Scott Neustadter amp; Michael H. Weber) would have found a way to fuse the two interpretations but this rote screenplay lacks the necessary insight. The success of The Fault in Our Stars has led distributor Fox to be bullish about the prospects for Paper Towns but the films arent comparable. The Fault in Our Stars is heartfelt and guileless - a touching depiction of what happens when youth clashes with mortality. Paper Towns is shallow and chokes on its own glibness. Its hard to believe both movies germinated from the pen of the same author.

"Paper Towns - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Paper Towns Posted by Christy Lemire on July 24 2015 1 Comment 20th Century Fox Rated PG-13 for some language drinking sexuality and partial nudity -- all involving teens. Running time 109 minutes. Three stars out of four. ""Paper Towns"" is a movie that I really liked but I probably would have loved if Id seen it when I was 13. If it had come out when I was in high school I would have felt like it was speaking directly to me with its mixture of angst and restlessness romance and melancholy. It actually reminds me a lot of the movies I loved best back in the 80s those of the late great John Hughes. Its a comparison I dont make lightly. Based on the novel by John Green (and mercifully not a shameless weepy like his mega-best seller ""The Fault in Our Stars"") director Jake Schreiers film features all those classic teen-movie tropes. Youve got members of a rigid social hierarchy stripping away their notions of each other neighbors who climb into each others bedrooms through upstairs windows late-night deep discussions and even the raging party at the rich popular jocks mansion. (Oh and the most important part of all a near-total lack of parental involvement.) As a grown-ass person whos seen a lot of movies in my life I recognize all these elements and find them kind of derivative albeit charmingly executed. What makes ""Paper Towns"" really work is the chemistry between its stars -- all of whom get the opportunity at one point or another to say just the right poignant thing at just the right time. As in ""The Fault in Our Stars"" which screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber also adapted these kids are hyper-verbal and self-aware. And thats OK -- because thats a crucial part of this particular kind of teen movie too. This is especially true of Cara Delevingnes beguiling and mysterious central character Margo. With her husky voice and quirky demeanor the Victorias Secret model-turned-actress is essentially doing Emma Stone doing a manic pixie dream girl -- or at least thats what the calculated mythology surrounding her character would suggest. Confident Margo moved in across the street from the sweetly geeky Quentin (a warm and deeply authentic Nat Wolff) when they were kids in suburban Orlando Florida and they became instant friends out of sheer proximity if nothing else. Now theyre seniors in high school running in very different circles. Quentin remains sweetly geeky but Margo has become even more of a force of nature the rebellious and impossibly popular cool girl. One night though she climbs through his window like old times and recruits him to help her with an elaborate revenge mission. Inherently cautious but recognizing that this could be one of those Nights That Change Everything -- and pathetically in love with Margo -- he says yes to her meticulous itinerary of breaking and entering vandalism bodily harm and humiliation. It is indeed the Night That Changes Everything for Quentin. Then the next morning Margo is gone. And this is actually the point at which ""Paper Towns"" becomes more compelling. The self-consciousness of Margo and Quentins analytical banter -- shes the one who gives the film its title in a monologue about superficiality -- gives way to legitimate self-discovery in her absence. In true manic pixie dream girl fashion reminiscent of the journey Kirsten Dunst sets Orlando Bloom on at the end of ""Elizabethtown"" Margo leaves a series of clues for Quentin as to her whereabouts. A scavenger hunt around town evolves into a road trip to upstate New York but what gives this adventure both smarts and heart is the fact that Quentin brings his two best friends with him. Wed gotten appealing glimmers of trash-talking Ben (Austin Abrams) and self-serious Radar (Justice Smith) leading up to this trip as they walk down the halls chat in the band room or play video games at Quentins house. But the loveliness of their friendship and the effortlessness of their chemistry truly shines once they band together for this mission. All three are distinctly drawn and dont feel like wacky adolescent types. Theyre smart but also sensitive and fiercely loyal to the others in a way theyre not afraid to show. Also along for the ride are a couple of welcome and well-acted female figures the beautiful and popular Lacey (Halston Sage) Margos best friend whos desperate to know whats become of her; and the strong-willed no-nonsense Angela (Jaz Sinclair) Radars girlfriend with whom he hopes to lose his virginity on prom night. (Ah yes another teen-movie staple prom which is fraught with expectation and disappointment.) Again you may think youve seen all this before -- and you have -- but since were discussing cliches here the journey truly is the destination and this one may not necessarily head in all the directions youd expect.

Photo Michael Tackett/Twentieth Century Fox The new John Green adaptation Paper Towns is a beautiful bait-and-switch. It starts off with our shy teenage hero Quentin (Nat Wolff) narrating how he came to meet his free-spirited next-door neighbor Margo Roth Spiegelman (Cara Delevingne) and how they grew up as best friends in suburban Orlando until the perils of teenage social classism pulled them apart; she became a cool popular beauty who partied with jocks while he became a nerd with poor social skills and no confidence. Even so Quentin refers to Margo as his ""miracle."" Shes fearless tough and mysterious. At least thats the fantasy into which he pulls himself -- and us. Paper Towns which was directed by Jake Schreier (who made a very good indie movie called Robot amp; Frank several years ago) and written by Michael Weber and Scott Neustadter (who also wrote the film adaptation of Greens The Fault in Our Stars as well as The Spectacular Now and 500 Days of Summer) purports to be a romance and then a mystery but it turns out to be something else altogether. Not long before theyre supposed to graduate from high school Margo materializes in Quentins bedroom and whisks him off on a night of creative retribution which involves breaking into her friends houses and cars and giving them nasty little reminders of a horrible betrayal. (Basically her boyfriends been cheating on her with one of her close friends and shes pissed.) Director Schreier shoots these two kids ultimately dorky revenge spree with an almost mythic sense of freedom -- contrasting the flat ominous blandness of these subdivisions with a vast twilit sky alive with possibility. By the time Margo and Quentin end their night in a drab empty corporate conference room with a great view looking out over the city as they dance to a Muzak version of ""Lady in Red"" were kind of in love with Margo ourselves and with everything she represents. ""The way you felt tonight is the way you should feel your whole life"" are her parting words to him. Then just as quickly as shed reentered Quentins life Margo disappears. In a few brief weeks myths grow around her. Shes reenacted it seems a typically American ritual Shes lighted out for the territory away from the drain of the everyday. Quentin taken by Margos childhood games and her fondness for dropping clues wherever she goes decides to track her down. Joining him are his two closest friends Ben (Austin Abrams) and Radar (Justice Smith a revelation) as well as Radars girlfriend Angela (Jaz Sinclair) and Margos best friend Lacey (Halston Sage) who had been the butt of one of Margos revenge pranks and now wants to redeem herself. As Quentin and the others start to follow Margos clues they start to bond in deeper ways ... and Ill stop right there with the plot description. I havent read Greens novel but I suspect that the film is pretty faithful to the original. As played by Delevingne Margo is indeed an apparition; the actresss oddly elfin features give her an otherworldly quality like a fairy stranded in suburbia approachable yet exotic. But shes not quite a manic pixie dream girl. She confesses to having done some lousy petty things. More important her euphoria can suddenly give way to impenetrable melancholy and she has a poetic understanding of others despair. In an early scene she and Quentin discover the body of a man who shot himself; thinking about him later Margo remarks ""All the strings inside him broke."" Quentin at first doesnt notice Margos deep undercurrent of sadness but we do. The film has already started to chip away at the fantasy long before he starts to do so. As Margo herself puts it ""Everythings uglier up close."" But like I said the film changes. At first it feels like a letdown. Delevingne is so good so magnetic that theres a palpable drop in pressure after she vanishes and Wolff while not a bad actor doesnt quite have the charisma to hold our attention. (Hes like a poor mans Miles Teller.) But the film clearly understands that because the slack is taken up by Quentins friends in particular Radar and Angela who seem to be having the rare healthy high-school romance. These kids are not Margo. Theyre ... kids filled with fear and anxiety articulate in their very inarticulateness; they stumble over their words even as they try to express deep feelings. (That these other actors seem to be genuinely younger than Delevingne and Wolff merely adds to the disconnect in an interesting way; the age difference feels thematically pointed.) Theyre real and grounded and life-size in a way Margo never was -- or more accurate in a way that Quentin never let Margo be. Theres a common language to these types of romantic teen flicks and Paper Towns hits all the requisite notes The soft indie-pop comes in at just the right moments and the light comedy plays well without stepping on the sensitive feelings being expressed. That might make it easy to mistake the film for humdrum genre work but theres something bold here too Paper Towns needs to explode its own mystique in order to make a point. It has to acknowledge that underneath all the melodrama these are just confused kids. The film could easily continue down its dreamy path but it has the cool idea of putting us under a spell and gradually imperceptibly pulling us back to the world of the real. The result isnt an all-the-feels drown-us-in-tears kind of experience but something rooted in wisdom and clarity. Its the rare movie that can sacrifice the clean lines of fantasy and melodrama for the messiness of ordinary life -- that neither burnishes nor condemns the up-down turmoil of the teenage soul but rather lets it be.A Tagscara delevignepaper townsjohn greenmovie reviewmoviesMore Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories Winona Ryder and the Power of Meta-Casting 8 Essential PokA(c)mon Go Tips Youall Want to Know Mike Birbigliaas Quest to Create Comedy of Communion Most Viewed Stories Constance Wu Slams Matt Damonas Great Wall Film for Perpetuating a aRacist Mytha 32.6k Shares Share Tweet LeBron James Reportedly Stopped Justin Bieber From Performing at the RNC 88 Shares Share Tweet John C.

Photo Credit AP / Michael Tackett advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A high-school boy goes looking for the runaway girl he loves. Rated PG-13 (mild language and suggested sexuality). BOTTOM LINE Lukewarm as a romance but the charming young cast helps compensate. CAST Nat Wolff Cara Delevingne Austin Abrams LENGTH 149 Nat Wolff plays an uptight high-school senior and Cara Delevingne is his free-spirited classmate in ""Paper Towns"" the latest film based on a young-adult novel by John Green. Like the last one ""The Fault in Our Stars"" this one is a collection of pretty moments and yearning pop songs rather than a fully convincing story. How well it works for you may depend on how close in age you are to its characters. Quentin Jacobson (Wolff) has been pining for Margo Roth Spiegelman (Delevingne) since she moved into his Orlando subdivision when they were children. While Quentin focuses on school and his future Margo becomes a charismatic kook (but a popular one) who collects vinyl and reads Walt Whitman. One night she breaks into his bedroom promising a series of wild adventures. advertisement | advertise on newsday Turns out shes mostly interested in pranking her cheating ex-boyfriend but Quentin mistakes this for the start of a romance. No such luck. Margo promptly vanishes leaving a trail of clues -- poetry quotes graffiti old maps. (Shes like a less violent ""Gone Girl."") Joining Quentin on his quest for Margo are his nerdy friends Ben (Austin Abrams) and Radar (Justice Smith) who will experience romances of their own. Along the way at least a few questions are raised about Margos manipulative passive-aggressive behavior. The film critic Nathan Rabin coined a term for characters like Margo -- the Manic Pixie Dream Girl. Shes the eccentric vivacious female who teaches our male hero how to embrace life yet lacks any depth of her own. (Think Natalie Portman in ""Garden State"" or going back further Audrey Hepburn in ""Breakfast at Tiffanys."") To Greens credit he tries to give Margo a hint of real-world darkness but she remains a trope. It isnt entirely Delevingnes fault that Margo never adds up to much more than a cocked eyebrow and a knowing smile. Directed by Jake Schreier ""Paper Towns"" has its low-key charms most provided by the appealing young cast. Wolff whose big round eyes have a searching intelligence is particularly good. He makes Quentin seem so bright and likable that you might find yourself hoping Margo never shows up. 231 MoviesPaper Towns trailer Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

Manori Ravindran Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 24 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Jul. 24 2015 1200AM EDT Comments AA Directed by Jake Schreier Written by Scott Neustadter Michael H. Weber Starring Nat Wolff Cara Delevingne Austin Abrams Justice Smith Classification PG Country USA Language English In the acknowledgments to his novel Paper Towns John Green recognizes Jon Krakauers Into the Wild as a ""particularly helpful"" book about disappearance. Indeed the 1996 non-fiction account tells the story of California native Christopher McCandless who after graduating from Emory University donated his savings to Oxfam and effectively disappeared hitchhiking to Alaska under the moniker Alexander Supertramp for an inspiring though ill-fated period of solitude. The fourth film in the Mad Max franchise starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron lands in theatres on May 15. Movie Preview Summer movie preview From Fantastic Four to Poltergeist 19 flicks coming your way Greens 2008 book - published just four years prior to his break-out novel-turned-film The Fault in Our Stars - similarly features a badass teenage transcendentalist Margo Roth Spiegelman who decides to quietly ""tramp a perpetual journey"" a la Walt Whitman right out of her paper-thin subdivision in Orlando while her smitten neighbour sets out to find her. Greens dark mystery is poetic incisive and wonderfully metaphor-laden.Its cinematic counterpart - penned by The Fault in Our Stars and (500) Days of Summer screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber - is none of these things.Directed by Jake Schreier Paper Towns finds Faults Nat Wolff upped to a lead role as the lovelorn Quentin Jacobsen who has spent most of his life transfixed by the charismatic Margo (played by model Cara Delevingne who - sorry haters - is for all intents and purposes Margo) his best friend from the age of 10 until high school when he was unceremoniously dropped once the caste system was sorted. A month out from graduation Quentin obsesses from afar in vain until one night Margo climbs through his bedroom window and demands his help in a moonlit revenge-seeking escapade. The development is short-lived however as the next day Margo disappears and while shes run away before she now seems determined to stay away.Soon after the vanishing Quentin and best friends Ben (Austin Abrams) and Radar (Justice Smith) spot a carefully placed poster in Margos bedroom blind ultimately leading to more clues about her whereabouts (cue Woody Guthrie records and highlighted Whitman passages). But as he sets out to unravel the mystery of her escape Quentin realizes that in order to find Margo he has to remove her from the pedestal and see her for who she really is.Neustadter and Webers script - remaining loyal to Greens novel in at least this regard - nicely conveys the sentimentality of those last loaded months of high school when every ending is rendered meaningful because no ones really sure what comes next. And to this effect the innocent trio of Wolff Abrams and Smith is the right combination of sweet and painfully awkward as they banter over video games and belt out the Pokemon theme song. Meanwhile Delevingnes Margo is cool confident and shrouded in question marks - Greens take on the Manic Pixie Dream Girl - but instead of upholding that sexist illusion like most teen-oriented fare Paper Towns brilliantly sets out to show that this girl doesnt and couldnt really exist.The problem though is that the mystery that was the books impetus is simply not present in its big-screen adaptation snatching away all urgency and finding a wooden Quentin going through the motions. Margos trail of breadcrumbs is all but served on a plate in the film and for someone supposedly risking it all (or at least perfect attendance and prom) for the girl of his dreams Wolffs Quentin is pretty unperturbed. Even the road trip of the films third act - meant to be a panicked race against the clock - seems to take the scenic route.While Neustadter and Weber managed in The Fault in Our Stars to transpose Greens quirky dialogue and evocative philosophies to the screen in condensing the book and extracting its darker elements they dont afford the underwhelming Paper Towns the same courtesy. Fans expecting more than a routine coming-of-age story had better prepare for a paper movie.

Close Join the conversation... On Facebook On Twitter With Britton Peele Comment on one of our official threads. Share This Story Share Discuss Meh Theres romance in Paper Towns but its not a romantic movie. Theres mystery but its not a detective story. Theres humor but its not a comedy.Its a story that has those things but is not about any of those things. Its a coming-of-age story that manages to avoid both easy labels and - perhaps as a result - a lot of clichA(c)s. Sure its a movie aimed at teenagers in which an unpopular guy wants to get a popular girl but theres a lot more to this storys map between points A and B.Based on the popular John Green novel of the same name Paper Towns is not a follow-up to last years Fault in Our Stars (also based on a Green book). There are no kids with cancer or deep musings about little infinities but you still get Greens signature realism. An imperfect setting with imperfect characters who have desires and flaws that young people (and people who were young once) can relate to. Quentin ""Q"" Jacobsen (played by Nat Wolff who was also in The Fault in Our Stars) has been in love with Margo Roth Spiegelman (Cara Delevingne) since she moved in across the street when they were both children. While they were close at first the pair grew apart as Margo became everything Quentin is not. Shes not just popular. Shes exciting mysterious and a rebel with a sense of adventure. Quentin meanwhile is in the school band has never skipped class and cares very much about where hes going to college.Until one night when Margo knocks on his window like they were kids again and persuades him to sneak out with her so she can enact an elaborate revenge plot against her ex-boyfriend and others who she feels have scorned her. The pair spend a memorable night breaking rules and getting closer and the adrenaline gets Quentin to start peeking out of his shell. Hundreds camp out for John Green Paper Towns event And then Margo is gone. Shes skipped town by morning leaving no note and telling nobody where shes going or whether shes ever coming back. While everyone in his life tells him to move on Quentin waits patiently. Then he finds a clue that Margo seems to have left for him to find meaning that maybe just maybe she wants him to come looking for her.His best friends Ben and Radar (Austin Abrams and Justice Smith young actors who both wonderfully embrace their characters own eccentricities) get roped into the search as do Margos friend Lacey (Halston Sage) and Radars girlfriend Angela (Jaz Sinclair). It may ultimately be Quentins journey but the ensemble cast grows together and helps keep the trip interesting.Like last years Fault in Our Stars the adaptation of Paper Towns remains mostly true to its source material. There is one noteworthy change which alters the reason behind a particular deadline toward the end of the film. In the book this deadline conveyed a real sense of urgency to the storys final act. The film version while still giving the protagonists a ticking clock to deal with removes a bit of power from the climax. Michael Tackett Still the story ends in a way that manages to defy expectations and eschew the ""teen movie"" norm though as a result its sure to disappoint those who want Paper Towns to be a fairy tale. But its true what they say What matters is the journey not the destination. PAPER TOWNS (B-)Directed by Jake Schreier.

A high-schooler searches for the girl hes loved since childhood. Director Jake Schreier (149). PG-13 Sexuality language. Area theaters. If youre searching for smart soulful teen entertainment you can start looking inside ""Paper Towns."" This film of author John Greens 2008 YA bestseller may throw off the authors legion of fans by stripping its story of some inessential elements but it does so for the right reasons. The satisfying result is a little like ""Breaking Away"" (1979) along with a dash of John Hughes and an appreciation for lifes big and small transitions. Quentin (Nat Wolff) has lived across the street from -- and loved -- Margo (Cara Delevingne) since they were 7. Now as high school seniors theyve grown apart. One night Margo whose quirky sorta bad-girl-ness is a fixation among her Orlando classmates enlists ""Q"" to help her in some revenge pranks against pals and an ex-BF whove wronged her. Longtime neighbors Margo (Cara Delevingne) and Quentin (Nat Wolff) reconnect in a memorable way in ""Paper Towns."" (Michael Tackett ) Q thinks its the start of something beautiful. But its really the beginning of a mystery. Margo disappears and Q and his buddies Radar (Justice Smith) and Ben (Austin Abrams) think theyve found clues to where she went. Along with Margos friend Lacey (Halston Sage) and Radars girlfriend Angela (a radiant Jaz Sinclair) he drives cross-country to a ""paper town"" a city on a map rumored to be fictitious. Q wants to express his love then get back home in time for the senior prom. The winning Wolff has a young Dustin Hoffman quality with just the right mix of dorkiness and exasperation. Delevingne a model-turned-actress is raw but still enigmatic enough to keep us curious when Margo is gone for the second half of the movie. Margo (Cara Delevingne) and Quentin (Nat Wolff) enjoy an unforgettable evening together in ""Paper Towns."" (Michael Tackett ) The screenplay by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber (""The Fault in Our Stars"" ""The Spectacular Now"") does a terrific job of refocusing the storys energy toward the guys friendship and their grasp of how graduation is the first big ending theyll face in life. Director Jake Schreier previously showed a flair for older interior lives with ""Robot amp; Frank."" He does the same here with kids on the verge of adulthood. ""Paper Towns"" arrives with less fanfare -- and with a better sense of humor -- than last years film of Greens ""Fault in our Stars"" which was a phenom. This one is less so with a cultural shadow that is not as long. ""Fault"" had more star power and bravery but ""Paper Towns"" respects the characters and core audience just as much. Its not just for teens but anybody who ever was one. ON A MOBILE DEVICE? WATCH THE VIDEO HERE.

"Review Paper Towns unfolds into a solid high school movie - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Paper Towns unfolds into a solid high school movie Review Paper Towns unfolds into a solid high school movie Michael Tackett / 20th Century Fox Nat Wolff is led on the best night of his life by Cara Delevingne in ""Paper Towns."" Nat Wolff is led on the best night of his life by Cara Delevingne in ""Paper Towns."" (Michael Tackett / 20th Century Fox) Rebecca KeeganContact Reporter Like a good prom date a good high school movie just needs to keep you entertained and out of trouble for a couple hours. A great high school movie -- ""The Breakfast Club"" ""Rebel Without a Cause"" ""Boyz n the Hood"" -- will linger in your mind well into adulthood.""Paper Towns"" a mild coming-of-age mystery adapted from ""Fault in Our Stars"" author John Greens bestselling novel of the same name is only a good high school movie. Its got an appealing cast and a promising premise as a group of high school seniors embarks on an adventure to find a missing classmate. Directed by Jake Schreier from a script by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber ""Paper Towns"" begins as a romance picks up steam as a mystery and ultimately finds its soul as a road movie about friendship.INDIE FOCUS Sign up for our weekly movies newsletter But the precocious beauty whose disappearance sets the plot in motion -- a myth of a girl named Margo -- is the kind of character who actually improves a movie by vanishing.Hyper-articulate teens are a specialty of Greens and his young adult readers love him for it. Like another bard of middle-class high school drama filmmaker John Hughes Green gives teens credit for having a rich interior life and thats a worthy endeavor. Unfortunately in the translation to screen articulate often becomes pretentious and Margos world weariness is never given a motivation apart from a 30-second scene of her hand-wringing parents. Omar Sy hit it big in Hollywood. So why did he return to France for Samba? Susan King French actor Omar Sy decided to take a ""step back"" after the international success of the 2011 comedy-drama ""The Intouchables.""

French actor Omar Sy decided to take a ""step back"" after the international success of the 2011 comedy-drama ""The Intouchables."" Sy became the first actor of African descent to win the Cesar Award Frances equivalent of the Oscar for best actor for his charming performance in the film as Driss... (Susan King) The far more appealing protagonist of the movie is Margos neighbor Quentin -- ""Q"" to his friends -- a loyal band geek played by Nat Wolff whos in love with her. Q is the kind of high school senior who dresses up like an iPod and answers the door for trick-or-treaters on Halloween night; Margo (Cara Delevingne) is the kind who gets picked up in a red convertible.Schreier manages to find a believable sense of place in Qs hometown of upscale suburban Florida with its tidy yards and sterile office parks and Neustadter and Weber who also adapted ""A Fault in Our Stars"" for director Josh Boone have a feel for the mundane moments of teen life that carry an emotional punch. Above and Beyond soars with true adventure Sheri Linden Jewish American World War II veterans wearing Nazi gear and flying re-purposed Messerschmitts for the newly formed country of Israel -- it might be the dramatic highlight of a period film by Steven Spielberg. But that paradox-rich episode is among the first-person recollections in an eye-opening... Jewish American World War II veterans wearing Nazi gear and flying re-purposed Messerschmitts for the newly formed country of Israel -- it might be the dramatic highlight of a period film by Steven Spielberg. But that paradox-rich episode is among the first-person recollections in an eye-opening... (Sheri Linden) Wolffs portrayal is natural and open with clenched hands longing glances and an endearing awareness that he has some growing up to do. His band geek friends feel authentic too Theres the earnest Radar (Justice Smith) who is too mortified by his familys massive collection of black Santas to bring home his more mature girlfriend and the hormonally driven Ben (Austin Abrams) whos the groups puckish instigator.When Q and his friends discuss girls over a game console or bond over the singing of a Pokemon song their Musketeer-like camaraderie is convincing or at least as much as a PG-13-rated conversation between adolescent males can be.But when Margo arrives at Qs window promising ""Basically this is gonna be the best night of your life"" something feels false about her swagger. I cant blame Delevingne a model who is transitioning to film acting for Margos troubles as a character -- she delivers fortune cookie lines like ""You have to get lost before you find yourself"" with conviction and her raspy voice and power eyebrows communicate just the right amount of danger for Orlando.When Margo leads Q on a night of mischief at the expense of some disloyal friends it shakes Q out of his comfort zone and sends Margo into a spell of self-seriousness as she stares glumly over the skyline bemoaning her ""paper town with paper people.""The movies title is a reference to a cartographers term for a fake place that exists only to catch copycat mapmakers and a central theme in ""Paper Towns"" is learning to discern the authentic from the affected and the real from the idealized. The problem is that Margos affectation is her depth.The good news is she disappears the next morning and Qs efforts to find her take on a satisfying Sherlockian vibe as clues come in the form of old maps folk records and Walt Whitman poems.By the time Q Radar Ben Radars girlfriend Angela (Jaz Sinclair) and Margos friend Lacey (Halston Sage) pile in a car to go find Margo and get back for prom night the movie is really rolling. As summer and college await they wind their way up the East Coast to the beat of a mood-boosting indie rock soundtrack their romantic tensions and roadside high jinks carrying the bittersweetness of a last adventure.Theres an old-fashioned chasteness to their banter -- even about sex -- thats charming in part because its so rare in modern movies. It seems unlikely anybodys mom will get angry about ""Paper Towns."" Rarer still is a studio movie for young adults that concerns itself not with vampires or the apocalypse but with the mundane matters of the heart.rebecca.keeganlatimes.com------------Paper Towns Rated PG-13 for some language drinking sexuality and partial nudity all involving teensRunning time 1 hour 39 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Reviews John Green John Hughes Nat Wolff Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-0724-paper-towns-review-20150725-story.html,200,papertowns11,papertowns,latimes

VPCNat Wolff gives a winning performance as a teenage boy in search of the girl he loves in Jake Schreiers film based on the John Green novel.""Paper Towns"" doesnt outshine ""The Fault in our Stars"" but it has heart.(Photo Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation)Story HighlightsWolff gives a particularly winning performance.The weak link is Delevingnes character whos not likable enough to go to all this trouble for.Critics rating 3 stars out of 5Quentin fell for Margo the day she moved in across the street when they were kids.Together they romped around the neighborhood on adventures but as they grew older she got wild beautiful and popular while he focused on his studies. By the time they are seniors they barely talk anymore.Until one night Margo appears at Quentins window just like the old days needing a driver to help her get some revenge.Thus begins ""Paper Towns"" director Jake Schreiers take on John Greens young-adult novel. Its not the teenage-tear-making machine ""The Fault in Our Stars"" the last film based on a Green novel was. But in addition to the screenwriting team of Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber it does share some qualities with that film good and bad.Margo (Cara Delevingne) tells Quentin (Nat Wolff) that this will be the best night of his life and as they tear through some minor vandalism and pranks to get back at the boyfriend who has cheated on her it becomes apparent that shes right. He needs to live a little.The endearing characters make up for the rather simple plot. (Photo Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation)But the next day she disappears. Its not the first time; she runs away enough that her parents are content to just wait for her to return. But she always leaves clues as to her whereabouts and Quentin is determined to find them and thus her.He enlists his geeky buddies Ben (Austin Abrams) and Radar (Justice Smith) to help. Theyre game though Radar has finally found a girlfriend Angela (Jaz Sinclair). With the help of Margos best friend Lacey (Halston Sage) they figure out where Margo might be -- upstate New York a long way from their home in Orlando -- and set out on a long drive in Quentins van to find her.So weve got a coming-of-age film with road-trip trappings with some teen romance and a mystery thrown in for good measure. Its all very pleasant -- the plot isnt particularly complex so the film is especially dependent upon the actors all of whom are enormously likable. The characters are the kind of kids its easy to spend some time with.Except oddly enough Margo. Delevingne plays her as cooler-than-thou confident to a fault. Theres a smugness about her that was also present in Gus the cancer patient played by Ansel Elgort who falls in love with Shailene Woodleys Hazel in ""The Fault in Our Stars.""AZCENTRALPaper Towns (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsThese are supposed to be precocious characters wiser than their peers. They at least give the impression of having it all figured out (though thats not always the case). It was somewhat off-putting in Gus. In Margo its so pronounced some of the characters even remark on it. Ben lusting after any girl who moves but finding an unlikely possible romantic interest in the super-popular Lacey tells her that Margo doesnt deserve a friend like her. And youre inclined to agree with him.Luckily since Margo is missing for much of the film she is ... well missing for much of the film. The other characters mesh together in winning fashion as they all come to terms in their own ways with the realization that one part of their lives is ending as another one is about to begin. The search is greater than the payoff.Weve seen the elements that make up ""Paper Towns"" before but thats OK. Schreier proves adept at avoiding cliches and is helped by his actors. Sage in particular makes Lacey more than the typical stuck-up beauty queen.But Wolff is best of all. His Quentin is smart enough to know what hes doing doesnt make sense and in love enough not to care. Thats a tricky combination and the one that drives ""Paper Towns.""Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

VPCLongtime neighbors Margo (Cara Delevingne) and Quentin (Nat Wolff) reconnect in Paper Towns.(Photo Michael Tackett)Corrections amp; clarifications An earlier version of this review misattributed a line from the movie to the character Ben. It was said by Radar.Boy meets girl boy and girl dont talk for nine years then boy and girl have one epic night together in the coming-of-age dramedy Paper Towns. And thats all before a road trip the high school prom and a collection of black Santas create a colorful background for this young adult canvas.Based on the popular John Green novel and directed by John Schreier the film doesnt have any teens with cancer and the kids miraculously stay off their smartphones. Instead Paper Towns (   out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide) is a satisfying look at young unrequited love bromances independence and letting go.Nat Wolff a holdover from last years Green adaptation The Fault in Our Stars is college-bound Orlando kid Quentin finishing out the last weeks of his high school career so he can move on to the next stage of his life.USA TODAYCara Delevingne goes bare in Paper TownsRe-enter Margo (Cara Delevingne) the literal girl next door hes been crushing on since they were kids. Even though they pass each other in the halls the two havent spoken in forever but nonetheless she mysteriously arrives at his window one evening for a midnight adventure and mission of revenge on Margos betraying friends. ""We bring the rain down on our enemies"" she says matter-of-factly.As quickly as she came back into his life the mercurial Margo disappears. Because she has a tendency to leave clues as to her whereabouts Quentin figures out that she may have hightailed it to New York. He rounds up a van full of pals -- loyal buddies Ben (Austin Abrams) and Radar (Justice Smith) Radars girlfriend (Jaz Sinclair) and Margos BFF (Halston Sage) -- to head north tell Margo how much he loves her and make it back in time for prom.USA TODAYNat Wolff transitions to Paper Towns leadAll gawk and nerdy charm Wolff effectively captures Quentins universality as a boy so into a girl hes bound to do anything even go searching for a ""paper town"" a fake town placed on a map to prevent copyright infringement. Abrams and Smith are aces as his band-room sidekicks with Radar having a home life thats a riot (his house is filled with his parents obsession for collectible black Santas) and getting such great lines as ""If theres a tuba there its not a party.""Green wrote the book Paper Towns as sort of a takedown of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl stock character but Delevingne imbues her enigmatic role with a lot of soul. Not only does the audience understand why everybody falls for Margo even though shes frustratingly flighty but Delevingne has such an unmistakable magnetism you miss the supermodel newcomer when shes not around for half the movie.Buoyed by an eclectic soundtrack Paper Towns sounds good and plays even better on screen with a boy a girl and heaps of teenage charm. 57 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1ML5Z2l",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/07/23/review-paper-towns-movie/30552313/,200,papertowns13,papertowns,usatoday

Michael Tackett/Twentieth Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Michael Tackett/Twentieth Century Fox Nat Wolff and Margo Cara Delevingne in Paper Towns. Michael Tackett/Twentieth Century Fox As the current king of teen lit author John Green is a barometer for what young readers respond to. His 2012 bestseller The Fault in Our Stars about two teenagers who fall in love in a cancer support group and its smash hit movie last year helped signal that teens were ready for big-hearted realism in their fiction after so many years of fantasy. This summers YA adaptation Me and Earl and the Dying Girl seemed to emerge from Greens shadow though it came overloaded with style and snark that many found off-putting (I didnt). The new film of Greens 2008 novel Paper Towns isnt nearly as radical in form or tone as Me and Earl but its a diverting romp that will get the job done for the authors ""nerdfighter"" fans. Fault was unapologetically a weeper but those hoping for more of the prized emotional currency known in todays parlance as ""feels"" will come up short on Paper Towns. This is much lighter fare a road trip beyond the outer reaches of a suburban teens comfort zone with a moral that boils down to finding empathy for others -- though I guess thats just another kind of feels. The films darkest image (apart from one edgy left-field joke about the Confederate flag) is that of a divorced man who has committed suicide and it appears briefly in the opening scenes to establish the character of the sort of person who would discover that body as a young girl. This is a brief devilish hint of a world thats nowhere to be found in the rest of the movie but its survival from page to screen points to just how much power Greens storytelling quirks hold over the filmmakers. The girl who discovers the body is Margo a thrill-seeking youngster who later matures into the kind of high school senior whos always taking off at a moments notice. Shes played in the present day by model Cara Delevingne whose take on the character is appropriately aloof -- she seems to always be thinking of something (somewhere?) that no one else can see. And thats exactly where she winds up after disappearing from her suburban Orlando town leaving only her admirer her lovestruck neighbor Quentin (the supremely likable Nat Wolff) whos just shared one magical night with the girl of his dreams only to find her gone in the morning. The disappearing act splits Paper Towns neatly into two parts. First theres the brisk opening third in which Quentin slavishly follows Margo around the suburban darkness helping her exact revenge against her cheating ex-boyfriend. Director Jake Schreier (Robot amp; Frank) propels us forward like Margo grabs Quentin moving the action at an entertaining clip with a minivans-and-manicured-lawns canvas that resembles Arcade Fires video for The Suburbs if you squint. Particularly intriguing in this passage is the sense that we dont and never fully could understand the world the way Margo does -- shes found another plane of reality shes happy there and she likes when ordinary folks like Quentin briefly stumble into it. This is subtly different from making Margo an empty cipher although the film does skirt that line a few too many times. After Margo leaves we get a flatter detective/road trip hybrid where Quentin follows a trail of clues in an attempt to track down his love and ropes in his friends to make the trip an aw-shucks bonding experience. (It speaks to the films harmlessness that no one not even Margos parents ever entertains the possibility that something truly awful has happened to her.) Though the sidekicks (played by Justice Smith and Austin Abrams) are fun particularly when belting out the ""Pokemon"" theme song to overcome their fear of dark places their characterization is flimsy and their journey is overly familiar. Theres even an impossibly attractive girl (Halston Sage) who falls for one of the shrimpy guys. Paper towns -- fake destinations cartographers put on maps to protect their copyright -- are a fascinating myth for Green to play with and they make a smart parallel for the films exploration of how people can turn into nonexistent ideals. But Green and the adaptations co-writers (Michael H. Weber and Scott Neustadter the same team behind Fault) feel the need to underline their message with multiple references to Moby Dick and constant reminders of Quentins naivete. One day the target audience will graduate to more subtle metaphors and crave more complex narratives provided they recognize that films like Paper Towns are maps for their feels rather than destinations. If only they each had their own Margo to act as a guide into the mysterious beyond.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet What do you call a middling movie that still has a share of grace notes? Paper Towns based on an Edgar-winning YA novel by John Green (The Fault In Our Stars) soft-pedals the source material leaving only a whiff of personality. Set in an Orlando subdivision the film follows high school senior Quentin (Nat Wolff) as he and his buddies Bloody Ben (Austin Abrams) and Radar (Justice Smith) try to deduce a set of clues left behind by impossibly cool crush object Margo Roth Spiegelman (Cara Delevingne) who has disappeared for the nth time following a break-up-induced revenge spree. The Ws of aspiring-grown-up taste--Woody Guthrie Wilco Walt Whitman--become hints in a puzzle and a marble notebook-ready metaphor involving cartographic copyright traps (the ""paper towns"" of the title) is tortured until its given up everything its got.Despite its glimmers of self-awareness Paper Towns works neither as a teen romance nor as a subversion of the same. Delevingne possesses an almost preternaturally interesting face but is at best a beginner actor. Thick furrowed brow and cocked head notwithstanding shes too feathery a presence to make her an object of sustained mystery and the script--by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber who also adapted The Fault In Our Stars--does her no favors by altering the ending of Greens novel so that instead of climactically breaking the central mystery fizzles away like an uncapped bottle of soda dissipating into a flat texture-less aftertaste. But while director Jake Shreier (Robot amp; Frank) doesnt do a whole lot with the camera besides make sure that there are people in the frame he does manage to provoke strong performances from Wolff--who looks kind of like a young Dustin Hoffman but stretched out like a piece of taffy--and the young supporting cast. The stated aim of Greens novel was to tweak a certain archetype--what The A.V. Club contributor Nathan Rabin once termed the Manic Pixie Dream Girl--common to romances told from the perspective of young men. In that respect the adaptation of Paper Towns is a failure. But even as it fails to either develop or subvert its characterization of Margo it succeeds in complicating all of its ancillary characters.Like Quentin they are introduced as broadly drawn archetypes Bloody Ben the shrimpy wannabe Lothario who tells tall tales of sexual adventure; high-strung Radar defined largely in terms of blackness including a slightly demented montage of his familys collection of black Santa memorabilia; Margos best friend Lacey (Halston Sage) long settled into a role as the bland blond sidekick. As the mystery turns into a road trip the characterizations and performances become more complex and naturalistic; characters who had at first only been sounding boards for Quentin suddenly start talking at length about their own lives. They get their own long talky scenes without him; they become independent of the plot.Theres a more palpable sense of physical closeness in Quentin Radar and Bens impromptu performance of the Pokemon theme song than in the dance--set to a smooth jazz cover of ""Lady In Red""--that Margo and Quentin share after sneaking into an office building. Which might just be the whole point--in other words that the people Quentin knows well are more interesting than the supposedly tantalizing mystery that is Margo. However it leaves an empty space at the center of the movie.

Its characters are intelligent and kind-hearted high schoolers who like going by first middle and last names and have some tough truths to learn before donning caps and gowns. But unlike in its predecessor The Fault in Our Stars the path to pubescent enlightenment in Paper Towns is more literal than existential -- a road trip rather than a fight with terminal cancer -- giving your tear ducts the night off at the cost of something a little deeper. Apart from source material written by Green the throughline from Fault to Towns is Nat Wolff who gets the deserved promotion from strong supporting actor to leading man. He plays Quentin -- Q for short -- a smart kid with plans to attend Duke in the fall and a paint-by-numbers outline for the decade after college. What he isnt expecting at the start of the film is a visit from Margo Roth Spiegelman (Cara Delevingne) his generously browed neighbor whos a bit of a local folk hero. Margo has an elaborate plan for revenge against her cheating boyfriend and his complicit group of friends that requires Quentins assistance something hes more than willing to provide to the girl he loves from across the street. Their one crazy night however is kept from becoming anything more than that when Margo disappears the next day without a trace. Well... there is some trace. Margo may have left behind a trail of clues hinting at her whereabouts for Quentin and his two best buds Ben and Radar (Austin Abrams and Justice Smith) to follow. The ""may have"" turns out to be an essential part of the mystery at the heart of Paper Towns and what Green is saying in a larger sense about teenage boys and the girls they worship. That message is one worth exploring but the real joy of Paper Towns is the interplay among Wolff Abrams Smith and eventually Halston Sage and Jaz Sinclair as Margos best friend and Radars girlfriend. Written by Faults screenwriting duo Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Webber the scenes between the intrigue have an ease and brightness that leave you wondering why anyones making such a fuss over Margo. Wed just rather watch these kids hang out.

"Paper Towns a life-affirming teenage trip review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesPaper Towns a life-affirming teenage trip reviewWith solid performances and a well-tuned script Paper Towns elevates standard teen dramedy to a higher level.By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. July 23 2015Paper TownsStarring Nat Wolff and Cara Delevingne. Directed by Jake Schreier. 109 minutes. Opens Friday at major theatres. PGAt last a movie about teens on the cusp of adulthood that has heart wit and soul.In fact Paper Towns is a movie that may remind those of us who have long left adolescence behind that there is such a thing as playing it too safe and that lifes mysteries are worth pursuing at any age.Article Continued BelowSkillfully adapted from the novel by John Green who wrote the book that begat last years hit The Fault in Our Stars this movie is once again about the relationship between two young people though it doesnt deal with anything nearly as heavy as terminal illness.Cara Delevingne plays Margo a young woman who mysteriously disappears after a night of mayhem.Rather it focuses on buttoned-down Quentin (Nat Wolff) who meets free-spirited new neighbour Margo (Cara Delevingne) at the age of 7 and remains beguiled by her for the next 11 years despite the fact they soon grow apart.Its senior year of high school with the prom approaching as Margo shows up late one night at Quentins second-storey bedroom window and persuades him to embark on a risky mission that involves payback on a cheating boyfriend and some others. Then she promptly disappears.But before she does Margo expounds on the films central theme the hazards of living in a world full of ""paper towns"" and people all too willing to settle for an existence of unquestioning and boring convention. Case in point Quentin whose own tepid game plan consists of graduating from medical school and having a wife and kids by the age of 30. Ho-hum. With the help of his two best buds Radar and Ben and Margos ex-BFF Lacey Quentin is determined to track Margo down following a trail of clues shes left behind. Margo has always loved a mystery and this one involves folk balladeer Woody Guthrie Walt Whitmans Leaves of Grass and a highway atlas of North America. And before you can say ""road trip"" theyre off on a life-changing adventure.Director Jake Schreier has assembled a sterling cast starting with Wolff as Quentin Q to his friends. The camaraderie between Q Ben and Radar -- all three outsiders from the popular cliques -- is the best part of the film with playful dialogue that has an authentic ring to it.While Wolff is appealing Austin Abrams gets the biggest laughs as the diminutive Ben whose alleged sexual exploits with a girl from Saskatchewan are cheerfully derided by his pals and Justice Smith is wonderfully likeable as the cerebral Radar. Whats more all three actors look like actual teenagers. What a conceptAnother nice surprise is Halston Sages textured performance as Lacey one of the ""in"" crowd who finds herself drawn to the oddball trio.Delevingne exudes an appropriately ethereal quality as Margo a young woman determined to think and act outside the mainstream box of life seeking truth in the margins.In addition to doing a fine job matching the actors who play young Quentin and Margo with the present-day ones Schreier also manages no small feat in making Orlando Fla. a rather appealing setting. The script isnt without its credibility problems. Quentins mom is a rather too permissive cipher and the teens all seem to have too much ready access to credit cards. But these are minor quibbles.With snappy dialogue solid performances and an ending that refuses to settle for saccharine Paper Towns is the antidote to commonly insipid teenage fare.Its a film that just may cause audiences of all ages to look beyond creature comforts and safe decisions to see life through fresh eyes as a mystery worthy of constant exploration and reflection.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Photo Twentieth Century Fox MOVIE REVIEW Paper Towns Running time 109 minutes. Rated PG-13 (profanity partial nudity). After three months of noisy wearying empty-headed blockbusters its tempting to overpraise a smaller romantic dramedy that tries to do something different. But Jake Schreiers deeply mediocre ""Paper Towns"" -- chronicling the adventures of a privileged white suburban teenager nudged out of his narrow comfort zone by a manic-depressive pixie dream girl -- doesnt venture much beyond its own young-adult comfort zone.Cara Delevingne and Nat WolffPhoto Twentieth Century FoxThis second adaptation of a John Green novel after last years surprise hit ""The Fault in Our Stars"" -- and by the same screenwriting team -- has an appealing leading man in Nat Wolff who had a supporting role in the earlier film. Here hes Quentin Jacobson a straight-A student whose childhood crush and neighbor Margo Spiegelman -- a paper-thin character played by model and It girl du jour Cara Delevingne -- walks in through his Orlando window one night nearly a decade after their lives drifted apart. The enigmatic Margo enlists a reluctant but smitten Quentin in a night of mildly naughty pranks incited by her cheating boyfriend (Griffin Freeman). But ""Risky Business"" its not and Delevingne is no Rebecca De Mornay. Cara DelevingnePhoto Twentieth Century FoxAfter Margo runs away from home Quentin decides shes left him a series of clues involving things like Woody Guthrie and the ""paper towns"" of the title to help him track her down. More than an hour drags by before he hits the road in his mothers SUV with his best buds horny Ben (Austin Abrams) and nerd Radar (Justice Smith) along with Radars new and very patient girlfriend Angela (Jaz Sinclair) and the insecure Lacey (Halston Sage) whos replaced Margo as their high schools queen bee. With the gang racing to complete Quentins mission before senior prom this is the most enjoyable part of the movie. That is until the anticlimactic reappearance of Margo basically a watered-down version of the character Gwyneth Paltrow played in ""The Royal Tenenbaums."" Chastely playing it safe ""Paper Towns"" is pleasant if derivative entertainment that makes the recent ""Me amp; Earl amp; The Dying Girl"" -- and virtually the entire John Hughes canon -- look positively cutting edge.

EntertainmentMovies Paper Towns Teen drama in a busy subdivision Originally published July 23 2015 at 1122 am Updated July 27 2015 at 340 pm Margo (Cara Delevingne) and Quentin (Nat Wolff) spend an unforgettable evening together in ""Paper Towns."" (Michael Tackett / Michael Tackett) A review of the screen adaptation of John Greens novel ""Paper Towns."" Rating 2.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic ""She loved mysteries and so she became one"" narrator Quentin (known as Q and played by Nat Wolff) tells us in the teen-dream drama ""Paper Towns."" Hes speaking of his neighbor and fellow high-school senior Margo Roth Spiegelman (model-turned-actor Cara Delevingne looking a tad old for high school) who after a late-night revenge spree disappears from their Orlando suburb just before graduation. Her parents have no idea where shes gone but Q -- caught up in the romance of it all -- finds clues that shes left behind and makes it his mission to find her. As befits a teen movie ""Paper Towns"" based on the YA novel by John Green (""The Fault in Our Stars"") is all about the drama -- unrequited love young romance a disappearing heroine a perfect prom night the nostalgia felt in the final weeks of high school and what one young character calls ""the lastness of it all."" And its also entirely about fantasy particularly in the character of Margo. As played by Delevingne she looks like a supermodel speaks with the sexy rasp of a femme fatale moves with the grace of a cat (when breaking into someones house she somersaults into the room like a gymnast) and even at the age of 9 in the films prologue is uncannily and poetically quote-worthy. (After seeing a corpse -- yes a lot happens in their subdivision -- little Margo wide-eyed intones ""All those dreams inside him broken."") But fantasy is the currency in which adolescent movies deal (why else in teen movies would everyones hair always be perfect?) and ""Paper Towns"" putters along agreeably enough. Most of the snappy dialogue is straight out of Greens book and rightly so. By the time Q realizes ""what a treacherous thing it is to believe that a person is more than a person"" the characters just might have grown on you a little bit. If not well thats what grown-up movies are for. Movie Review 1/2 Paper Towns with Nat Wolff Cara Delevingne Halston Stage Austin Abrams Justice Smith Jaz Sinclair. Directed by Jake Schreier from a screenplay by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber based on the novel by John Green. 113 minutes. Rated PG-13 for some language drinking sexuality and partial nudity -- all involving teens. Several theaters. Moira Macdonald 206-464-2725 or mmacdonaldseattletimes.com.

(Michael Tackett/Twentieth Century Fox) Still of Nat Wolff and Cara Delevingne in ""Paper Towns."" (Michael Tackett/Twentieth Century Fox) Photo Twentieth Century Fox McClatchy-Tribune News Service Romantic mystery Paper Towns has its moments 1 / 1 Back to Gallery ""Paper Towns"" from ""The Fault in Our Stars"" author John Green isnt so much a teen romance as it is romantic about teens -- for better or worse. Ordinary guy Quentin (Nat Wolff) has ordinary ambitions as he and his two nerd besties wrap up the gantlet of ceaseless discomfort that is high school. Quentin has forever pined for neighbor Margo (Cara Delevingne) but she is extraordinary dangerous weird always having adventures yet somehow in with the in crowd. Then Margo hijacks him for an all-night adventure ... and vanishes. Quentin goes from chasing paper to chasing the clues she left behind. Despite its somewhat novel romantic-mystery structure ""Paper Towns"" borrows from a number of sources including dipping its ladle into the John Hughes wellspring (elements of ""Ferris Buellers Day Off"" and others) and mixing ingredients from various road-trip movies into its cauldron. If the result is less than magical its occasionally potent. Much of its charm is owed to the supporting cast including Austin Abrams and Justice Smith as the nerds and Halston Sage as the improbable dream girl. The actors seem just at ease enough with each other to make their long friendships convincing as they join Quentins quest. Indie director Jake Schreier (""Robot and Frank"") moves the action along while giving the relationships room to breathe. The rest of the goodwill comes from the screenplay by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber who also adapted ""Fault in Our Stars."" Although ""Paper Towns"" doesnt have the lightning-in-a-bottle feel of the duos ""(500) Days of Summer"" or the casual brilliance of their ""The Spectacular Now"" it does contain their hallmarks of telling details sparkling dialogue and a refusal to treat teen characters as genre tropes. No matter how unlikely their adventures the characters talk like real people without the stink of condescension to the audience. They also get some laugh lines in as when nerd Radar (Smith) disputes Quentins assertion they have been to parties before (""If theres a tuba there its not a party.""). ""Towns"" treads a fine line between inspiration and contrivance shakily at times along similar ""Fault"" lines to Greens previous adaptation. Theres a sticky trap in that the supposedly beguiling Margo reads as not so much. Her whiplash mood changes seem as if they would become tiresome pretty quickly and her actions are selfish to the verge of sociopathic. Overlooking the city she complains she doesnt know anyone who cares about anything that matters. And eyes roll across America. Self-absorption might be a common teen trait but its glorification here may fail to excite those old enough to know they dont know everything. Wolff (blind friend Isaac in ""Fault"") who reads like a young Jonathan Silverman and Delevingne play well enough off each other but dont exactly set off fireworks together. When ""Paper Towns"" works its fun. The substance of the trios friendship and the essence of the worlds wide-openness at that age raise the material above most YA-genre entries. Although the central relationship never ignites the films greatest love seems to be for the very romance of teenage nights staying out too late making unwise decisions and doing things for both the last and first time.

Wait thats a good thing. None of the main characters die of cancer in Paper Towns and the script by Faults Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber of the ever-wonderful (500) Days of Summer pulls back on the weepy bits in favor of whats funny touching and vital. There may be nothing fresh left to find in teens coming of age but director Jake Schreier (Robot and Frank) fakes it with genuine sincerity. More News Summer Movie Preview 2015 From Superheroes to Strippers 40 Best YA Novels Gia Coppolas Teenage Wasteland All Stories >> Related Intro to Nerdfighters 101 A John Green Primer Need to brush up on the popular Fault in Our Stars author before seeing the movie? Heres a guide to the basics And he has a winning cast to sell it. Nat Wolff good enough in Fault Palo Alto and the upcoming Grandma to make you say -- who is this kid hes got something -- stars as Quentin Jacobson Q for short. Q is the risk-averse Orlando nerd whos been crushing on the wild child next door Margo Roth Spiegelman (Cara Delevingne) since he was nine and they found a dead body together (no cancer the dude shot himself). Now Margo is the most popular girl in school and one night she climbs through Qs window dressed as a ninja and leads him on a revenge spree against those who wronged her. No murders mostly its just shaving off a jocks eyebrow wrapping a car in plastic and shooting video of her cheating boyfriends ant-sized dick. But Qs heart is beating hard. When Margo doesnt show up at school -- even with prom and graduation coming -- Q follows her clues involving Walt Whitman and Woody Guthrie to a small New York town thats not even on the map (cartographers create such fictional towns to protect against copyright infringement hence paper towns). On the drive Q brings along his friends Radar (Justice Smith) and his girlfriend Angela (Jaz Sinclair) and horndog Ben (Austin Abrams) and Margos bff Lacey (Halston Sage) a honeybunny who inspires Bens carnal fantasies. This road trip is booby-trapped with teen cliches. And readers of the book wont like some crucial changes (what no Sea World?). But the central romance holds you. Supermodel Delevigne wears down any resentment of yet another Brit playing an American teen. Her flashing eyes and throaty voice indicate the star power to make it in pictures that move. And Wolff is terrific giving us a romantic image of confused youth to root for. Ok Paper Towns plays it safe but its leads are irresistible so were never sorry.

Its an old lesson perhaps but one worth applying to the film itself Its smarter than it looks. After all with its soft summer opening and fresh-faced cast the movie seems like a fairly conventional teen romance about how the sweet but not-very-hunky boy lands the gorgeous high-school princess. Yawn. Add in the cast - Nat Wolff whos forever stuck with ""The Naked Brothers Band"" on his resume and Cara Delevingne a supermodel chiefly known for her unplucked eyebrows and unabashed lifestyle - and its easy to pass this one by. Dont. Because if you do you (or your kids) will miss a surprisingly sweet sensitively observed movie about recognizably real teens filled with some natural performances and a script that tries to steer around (or at least speed through) the cliches. The story comes courtesy of ""The Fault in Our Stars"" scribe John Green; the direction is by Jake Schreier who made the nicely offbeat ""Robot and Frank"" a while ago. And both work well at spinning out an odd little road movie in which - as it should be - the pleasure is in the journey not the destination. The film sets up a cute crush-at-first sight between little kids (and new neighbors) Quentin and Margo; skip ahead half-a-dozen years and shes the quirky cool queen of high school and hes the geeky band-camp kid with an Ivy League ticket (but no date for the high-school prom). Then one day Margo disappears. Her parents arent concerned; shes 18 shes run away before and frankly shes always been a handful. But quietly pining Quentin cares. And when he realizes shes left behind an odd assortment of clues to her destination he organizes a quest of valiant adventurers. Oh and borrows his moms minivan. This is all pleasantly offbeat and its helped along by a terrific ensemble cast. Delevingne has an expressive mobile face and stands out in suburban Orlando like a hothouse orchid; Wolff is engaging but low-key (just two years ago this would have been ""the Miles Teller part."") Particularly good too are supporting actors Austin Abrams and Justice Smith; the three boys actually act and react like old friends full of shared memories and stupid private jokes. And as they set off on their journey to find Margo the movie relaxes into a character study as Quentin and his friends (whove brought along one current and one really-hoped-for girlfriend) learn something about themselvesone and each other. Unlike ""The Fault in Our Stars"" or ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" this isnt a movie with big emotional moments (or any relentless attempts to exploit them); its a lot quieter than that and in a summer full of superheroes dinosaurs and earthquakes it could very easily get drowned out. But try listening a little harder. It has something to say. Ratings note The film contains sexual situations and underage drinking. Paper Towns (PG-13) Fox Searchlight (109 min.)

Daily Edition Login to download Paper Towns Film Review 1200 PM PDT 7/4/2015 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS A modest middle-of-the-road teen drama TWITTER Starring Nat Wolff and Cara Delevingne Jake Schreiers film is the first from the John Green stable since the smash ""The Fault in Our Stars."" Based on an earlier teen fave novel by The Fault in Our Stars author John Green Paper Towns is a mild coming-of-ager about dawning awareness and life lessons learned among a small group of Florida high school seniors. Part mystery story part road movie and part pre-prom graduation romp the film is most interesting as a perspective on adolescence in which all the girls are more mature nervy and perceptive than any of the boys who have some catching up to do if theyre to have a chance with any of them. This one wont rake in anywhere near the 307 million Stars generated internationally last summer but Fox will still make a tidy sum with this modest entry that begins rolling out in foreign territories next week ahead of the July 24 domestic bow. Adapted by Stars screenwriters Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber from the winner of an Edgar Award for best young adult mystery novel of 2008 Paper Towns hinges on the lifelong fascination the smart semi-dweeby Quentin (Nat Wolff who played the leads best friend in Stars) nurses for his across-the-street neighbor Margo (Cara Delevingne). Best friends and partner in crime as young kids theyve grown apart since Margo became hot and popular so it comes as a jolting surprise to Q as hes known when Margo shows up in his bedroom late one night shortly before the end of the school year and dares him to take her out in his parents car. She wont specify the reasons but break down his wimpy resistance merely by saying ""Basically this is going to be the best night of your life."" Read more Paper Towns Ansel Elgort Advises Nat Wolff on How to Treat Devout John Green Fans Margos agenda is to extract revenge on her cheating boyfriend which she does with some reluctant help from Q in prankishly creative ways. After Margo has visited sufficient humiliation and discomfort on her ex she and Q end up in a high-rise looking down on Orlando at night which puts her in a philosophical mood its ""a paper town with paper people"" she observes to which Q reacts with an incomprehension likely to be matched by that of the audience. But she tartly adds that Qs comfort zone is very small compared with her own and that he will need to take much greater risks if he wants to get something out of life and by implication from her. And then she disappears. Completely. She doesnt show up at school for days shes left home. No one knows what to think. While Q and his borderline-nerdy buds Ben (Austin Abrams) and Radar (Justice Smith) count the days until graduation and mull over prom plans -- the particularly obnoxious Ben fantasizes about taking blond bombshell Lacey (Halston Sage) whos just split with her boyfriend while Radar plans to lose his virginity that night to his girlfriend Angela (Jaz Sinclair) -- Q fixates on the idea that Margo has left hidden clues about her whereabouts that he begins piecing together and sharing with his patient but skeptical friends. Some apparent tips involve references to such old standby counterculture heroes as Woody Guthrie and Walt Whitman while others require repeated visits to a boarded-up building that director Jake Schreier (Robert amp; Frank) tries but fails to build into spooky suspense sequences. Despite pretty flimsy evidence Q manages to convince his pals that they should drop everything and join him on a drive all the way to New York state where he is certain Margos hiding in a true ""paper town"" (a term for nonexistent communities created by map-makers to thwart plagiarizers). So Ben Lacey Radar and Angela all agree to pile into a minivan for the trek -- provided Q guarantees their return by prom night. Read more Paper Towns Clip Cara Delevingne Coerces Nat Wolff Into ""Having Fun"" (Video) For entirely accidental reasons Paper Towns will receive an enormous amount of unintended notoriety based on an incidental sequence that touches upon some major ongoing news. At a gas station pit stop somewhere in the South Radar who is black decides he needs a new shirt and picks one up. It isnt until theyre all back in the van however that he unfolds the T-shirt to discover the Confederate flag splashed across it along with the phrase ""Heritage Not Hate."" He laughs about it and merely turns it inside-out before putting it on By the end nearly all the storys questions mysteries and dilemmas have been neatly answered and tied up with just a dash of melancholy and a hint of maturity added to the mix as life moves on albeit with more than a bit of fantasy where Ben and Lacey are concerned. In its considered neatly packaged way the film occupies a safe and solid middle-class middle ground in teen storyland between crass gross-out comedies and mawkish romance on one side and edgy exploratory indie fare on the other. The affable sincerity of the cast helps led by the likably open performance by Wolff whose Quentin becomes visibly aware of how much growing hes still got to do. Delevingne delivers sufficient dynamics to carry the early going with her characters well-wrought sense of payback and mystery but she remains largely offscreen most of the way. Sage thus takes up some slack on the female side by giving some shadings if not depth to a standard-issue prettiest-girl-in-school character. Smith plays it very deadpan as Radar while Abrams Ben is hard to take until the prospect of Sage in his life forces him to start acting like an actual human being.

The title of ""Paper Towns"" refers to a trick that cartographers use to keep their maps from being copied by competitors. But it also describes in a less literal sense that brand of suburban disillusionment where everything and everyone in life seems phony stifling and two-dimensional -- a condition to which some sensitive teenagers can be especially susceptible. If its authenticity these young adults seek they could do far worse than this second film drawn from a John Green bestseller (after last years hit ""The Fault in Our Stars"") It may not subvert every cliche of the high-school romance genre but director Jake Schreiers coming-of-age dramedy nonetheless pulses with moving and melancholy moments as it follows a 17-year-old boy who spends an unforgettable night with the girl of his dreams then decides to pursue her when she suddenly leaves town the next day. Athough it shares several producers a writing team (Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber) and an actor (Nat Wolff) with Josh Boones adaptation of ""The Fault in Our Stars"" Schreiers film seems unlikely to match its predecessors runaway commercial success (307 million worldwide). Which is a bit of a shame insofar as ""Paper Towns"" turns out to be the better movie -- less tearjerking and more affecting and populated by characters who are presented not as paragons of cancer-riddled virtue but rather as flawed ordinary young individuals who are touchingly vulnerable to the social pressures and sexual anxieties of contemporary teenage life. Thats true even of those who try to rise above (or sink below) it all like Quentin Jacobson (Wolff) a high-school senior in Orlando Fla. who has long since absorbed the perks of being a wallflower. Hes a good student shy but not irredeemably awkward and utterly disinterested in going to prom unlike his two best friends the smart self-conscious Radar (Justice Smith) and the goofy perpetually horny Ben (Austin Abrams). But Quentin is a romantic at heart having nursed a longtime crush on his beautiful next-door neighbor Margo Roth Spiegelman (Cara Delevingne) who used to climb in through his bedroom window when they were kids -- a habit she dropped around the time she became the most popular girl in school. So its something of a blast from the past when she appears one night and asks him to chauffeur her around the neighborhood while she takes care of some pressing business. Figuring what the hell Quentin becomes Margos accomplice over a long and crazy night of revenge against those friends who have betrayed her. Whether theyre busting her cheating b.f. (Griffin Freeman) practicing some strategic hair removal on a hated jock (R.J. Shearer) or wrapping a girlfriends car in plastic their pranks leave Quentin feeling alive in a way he rarely has. He also finds himself falling more in love than ever with Margo a tougher more independent-minded girl than youd expect from her high-school queen-bee status. That Margo is something of a mystery becomes even more apparent the next day when she runs away from home -- not for the first time according to her blithely indifferent mother (Susan Macke Miller). But Quentin is bent on finding her especially after he stumbles on what appears to be a trail of clues that she left behind -- a Woody Guthrie poster here a message in an abandoned mini-mall there -- and that will lead him to a real-life ""paper town"" where she may have taken up temporary residence. Tagging along for this unplanned road trip are Ben Radar and his g.f. Angela (Jaz Sinclair) and popular girl Lacey Pemberton (Halston Sage) whos worried about what might have happened to Margo. Yet the groups concern takes on conflicting shades as Quentins determination begins to tilt into obsession and he learns firsthand the dangers of idealizing someone he doesnt really know while taking for granted the ones he does. Despite the movies puzzle-like structure Schreier (who directed the 2012 Sundance fave ""Robot amp; Frank"") keeps ""Paper Towns"" recognizably steeped in the common rituals of young adulthood which is to say the well-worn conventions of so much teen cinema. There are house parties and pop quizzes locker-side confrontations and urine accidents plus some raunchy talk about hot moms and sexually transmitted diseases. Large quantities of beer are consumed and disgorged and parental supervision is pretty minimal. Quentin and his friends play out their adventures against a wall-to-wall indie-rock soundtrack that proves overly insistent yet undeniably effective catching us up in a swirl of emotion as the characters make their way up the East Coast and back all en route to a moving prom-night climax. But if ""Paper Towns"" can seem a touch familiar it rarely feels pro forma. Neustadter and Webers largely faithful adaptation strikes a nice balance between the hyper-eloquence of Greens dialogue and the natural rhythms of everyday teenspeak and they keep up a steady stream of low-key character-driven humor -- including one priceless regionally specific sight gag that feels even more pointed now than it would have a month earlier. And while the production might well have benefited from a richer more varied sense of place (Charlotte N.C. stood in for both Orlando and upstate New York) what distinguishes Schreiers work here is his ability to sustain a bittersweet mood of anticipation and regret as his characters struggle to take hold of the fleeting ungraspable moment. Whether its focusing on Radars sweet nervous courtship of Angela or the unexpected bond that forms between Ben and Lacey this tale of self-discovery stays true to Greens poignant message that people are always more complicated than the neat identities we try to assign them. Bearing out that theme most of all are the films young actors all of whom get the opportunity to reveal more than one dimension of character. Wolff whos present in just about every scene manages to hold the center as a young man who isnt overly concerned about either standing out or fitting in and whose behavior can often be as hesitant as it is impulsive. But the real find here is Delevingne an English actress who with her subtly smoky voice and piercing gaze makes the girl of Quentins fantasies a singularly charismatic presence all the more so due to her limited screen time. What ultimately happens to Margo may seem somewhat ambiguous by films end but on the evidence of her work here this striking actress is here to stay.

Rebecca says July 4 2015 at 801 pm Shame you dont live in the real world. The Fault in our stars and Paper Towns are two very different pieces of work and to compare one to the other is bloody ridiculous. Also saying Paper Towns is the better movie because none of its characters are riddled with cancer is highly offensive. You are a bloody idiot. Reply Jeremy says July 21 2015 at 545 pm Yeah so that is not even close to what he said if you actually care to read the article. The reviewer is saying that Paper Towns is the better movie because it has more complexity to its character development which was something that TFIOS lacked. And you can most certainly compare the two movies to one another; they are in fact quite similar in both their presentation and themes based on the Paper Towns trailers. Reply ihopeigetit5678 says January 2 2016 at 551 am I have only seen Paper Towns but I find it hard to believe that the characters in TFIOS could be any less complex than those in Paper Towns (judging from the critical acclaim of TFIOS). The characters in Paper Towns were not complex at all and rather uncompelling. Margo seemed like a self-absorbed bitch and it made no sense that he would fall in love with her much less go to NY for her after hanging out with her for one night after years of not talking to her. Then his other friends seriously just left him there in the paper town in NY??? Totally unbelievable and goes against any previous character traits they had developed. Very few things about this movie made sense. After I watched I just had to wonder to myself ""why? What is the point of anything that I just watched?"" It was a pointless movie largely because its characters were so bland and fake. CMS says July 4 2015 at 714 pm JUSTICE SMITH PLAYED RADAR NOT JAZ SINCLAIR. JAZ PLAYED ANGELA Reply tiaharajenise says July 4 2015 at 451 pm Very great review I loved TFiOS but I do think Paper Towns is going to be a lot better. For one I really like that there are more teenagers involved whereas TFiOS only had three teen main characters. And aside from finding Margo all these characters (minus Quentin whos made it his prime mission) have their own things going on that theyre busy with-like Ommictionary black Santas honeybunnies prom Also with Paper Towns theres a mix of romance comedy mystery and drama unlike TFiOS which was mostly sad more than anything else. Im going to Night On the Towns and Im so excited D This movie is going to be AMAZING. And Radar is played by Justice Smith not Jaz Sinclair ) (But I did laugh at that haha) Reply tiaharajenise says July 4 2015 at 739 pm First of all I am not lying. AT ALL. I have absolutely no reason to I get nothing out of it. And second no one loves everything. I dont love everything. But yes I am a fan of both TFiOS and Paper Towns. Believe it or not many people are-so I guess theyre insincere liars like me right? Your opinion of me couldnt be any more irrelevant and you can hate me all you want but I just wanted to put this out there. Its one thing to voice your perspective/thoughts of things in a respective and mature manner. But youre just here harrassing people. Is this what you like to take time out of your day to do? Reply geekgirl says July 4 2015 at 214 pm Correction Radar is played by Justice Smith. Reply Alexandra (Alexand01686398) says July 4 2015 at 153 pm This movie sounds wonderful Im so looking forward to it. John Green and Jake Schrier along with the rest of the crew made a terrific romantic movie. The themes are very relevant for contemporary teenagers. ) Reply Captain Metropolis says July 4 2015 at 217 pm First you say youre looking forward to it then you note that its a terrific movie. Could you be perhaps be pre-sold on a film you havent even seen? Reply Alexandra Keleti says July 4 2015 at 858 pm Its true I am pre-sold on the film. The trailer and the interview clips with the actors expose exciting parts of action scenes and make clear major themes of the movie. Its enough to show the movie will appeal to large audiences and achieve more great reviews. schmit1993 says July 4 2015 at 432 pm The fault in our stars is what they are referring to Scarface says July 4 2015 at 1234 pm Lol can Hollywood stop adapting novels biopics comics  video games etc instead of coming up with fresh amp; original ideas? Reply Guest says July 4 2015 at 425 pm Whos forcing you to watch these adapted films? Reply Mantle Head says July 4 2015 at 650 pm He has a point... no one forces anyone to watch H/wood movies; but some original IP would be nice... wont happen but these movies suck the originality incentive from screenwriting (who can write a great piece of original IP in script form; and I am not talking about in-house development stuff... where is the incentive to write something original not there; so the art form is suffering all s/writers write the same crap make a living... if a studio wont develop their own IP the craft of screenwriting is the big loser- and audiences of course). So it does have an affect. Daniels says July 4 2015 at 423 pm Hollywood has adapting books biopics etc. for the very beginning. If you dont like it then dont watch it. Its not rocket science. Reply cadavra says July 4 2015 at 1229 pm I hate to be a pedant but it seems unlikely that Jaz Sinclair plays both Radar and Angela. Which is it? Reply Mantle Head says July 4 2015 at 658 pm Its a very modern teenage fable one actor transitions to another... and Jenner makes a Cameo as a sex consultant very modern relevant to the irrelevant (teenagers you know...).

Other films however operate in a far more aspirational mode where even the nerdy kids get a chance to date the cheerleader and all the characters speak with the wit and wisdom of middle-aged screenwriters. ""Paper Towns"" an adaptation of a novel by ""The Fault in Our Stars"" author John Green operates resolutely in the latter category but its no less intriguing for its utter artificiality. Even if the smarmily sanctified and beautifully doomed male lead of ""Fault"" made you want to run screaming from the theater you may find yourself on board with this movies road trip particularly since it suggests that savvy sexy and seemingly put-together teen characters might be nothing more than a Rorschach blot upon which others can project their own dreams and inadequacies. See Video Nat Wolff Solves the Mystery of Cara Delevingne in New Paper Towns Trailer (Video) The It Girl of ""Paper Towns"" is Margo Roth Spiegelman (Cara Delevingne of ""Anna Karenina"") who entranced her across-the-street neighbor Quentin (Nat Wolff of ""Palo Alto"") pretty much from the moment her family moved in a decade earlier. As children the two explored their Orlando suburb on their bikes until the day they found the body of a man whod committed suicide. Late that night Margo wanted to go to Sea World to investigate his life and learn why hed killed himself but the more reserved Quentin declined to join her. Since then Margo grew into a glittering wild child while Quentin hunkered down on his books and hung out with fellow nerds Ben (Austin Abrams of ""The Kings of Summer"") and Radar (Justice Smith). The neighbors barely speak anymore until toward the end of their senior year when Margo gets Quentin to drive her around town on a late-night mission of vengeance against her boyfriend and best friend who have been carrying on together behind Margos back. Also Read 9 Breakout Movie Stars of Summer 2015 Navigating the Galaxy From Paper Towns to Tomorrowland For the normally cautious Quentin the evening is a thrill ride and Margo tells him that he should always feel his heart pounding the way it is when theyre together. The next day Margo disappears (shes run away so frequently that her parents dont even go looking) and Quentin sets out to find her following maps and other clues that shes left behind. (""Paper towns"" incidentally are fake cities used by mapmakers to catch others who might steal their work.) Once hes figured out where shes gone Quentin sets off on a wild goose chase with Ben Radar Radars girlfriend Angela (Jaz Sinclair) and Margos popular pal Lacey (Halston Sage of ""Neighbors""). As they make their way up the East Coast lessons will be learned attachments will be formed the mysteries of Margo will be at least partially unraveled and Confederate flag T-shirts will accidentally be purchased. (This gag remains funny but it has an extra layer of ouch given the events of the past month.) The screenwriting team of Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber hew closer to their previous collaboration on ""(500) Days of Summer"" than their work on ""The Fault in Our Stars"" and thats a good thing. As slick and contrived as the plotting may be from time to time the writers and director Jake Schreier (""Robot amp; Frank"") throw in enough charming character moments and literal forward motion (this is a road movie after all) to avoid getting bogged down in whiny teen solipsism. You might not believe that any of these kids exist but youll enjoy hanging out with them. Also Read John Greens Let It Snow Movie Lands 2016 Release Date From Universal Schreier also makes the most of a gifted ensemble Wolff Abrams and Smith have a funny and unforced rapport and Sage makes it easy to believe that her character is off to Dartmouth in the fall. Fashion model Delevingne has relatively little screen time but makes an undeniable impression as a high school heartbreaker with the smoky eyes and smokier voice destined to send young men into a frenzy; theres no question why Quentin would hijack his moms minivan and drive up I-95 to find her. If youre outside of the John Green demographic your enjoyment of ""Paper Towns"" will rely upon your willingness to stomach certain contrivances not to mention a soundtrack stuffed with the songs of todays youth. (Composer Ryan Lotts score can barely get a note in edgewise.) But even those adults who remained resolutely dry-eyed during ""The Fault in Our Stars"" might find themselves wanting to hop aboard for this journey even if the seats are covered in Cheetos dust.
