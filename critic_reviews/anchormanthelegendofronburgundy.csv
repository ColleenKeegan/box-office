They can be reduced to familiar stereotypes while providing a source of guilt-free sexist gags. Such gags result when anchorman Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) and pals get their flares in a flap about ambitious new employee Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate). No sooner has Ron wooed her than shes stepping into his shoes. Will he accept her success graciously? No hell bellow obscure insults from the rooftops and pound his hairy chest at the shame of being eclipsed by a female. In this world being an anchorman is the ultimate masculine prize. As Veronicas power increases her male colleagues weaken. Their pride can only be reclaimed by rescuing Veronica from bears in a zoo (We bears are a proud race. They must pay for their intrusion the creatures growl via subtitles before grudgingly accepting newcomers as the anchormen do). But plot isnt the primary interest here this is as flimsy as a sitcom and its shot like one too. Like a Saturday Night Live sketch its propelled by its absurd humour from silly erection jokes to hilariously surreal exchanges (What?... You know I dont speak Spanish Ron admonishes his barking dog). This takes a joke and runs with it - sometimes too far but usually long enough to wear you down and force you to submit to its craziness. With cameos from chums Ben Stiller Jack Black Luke Wilson and Vince Vaughn the film smacks of self-indulgence but throws enough comic talent at the screen to make it stick. This particular boys club isnt facing extinction just yet.

"Anchorman Steals the Show washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids On Screen Anchorman Steals the Show Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 9 2004 ""ANCHORMAN The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" is wonderfully silly all the time. You may not laugh as hard as you want to but the movies premise has irresistible mileage Will Ferrell as a 70s telegenic newsman-stud. Well stud in his own mind. His name is Ron Burgundy. Hes the lead anchor for San Diegos Channel 4 news and he rules the local ratings. Hes a little tubby around the middle. Likes turtleneck sweaters and tight white pants. Sports the big-hair-and-mustache combination straight from the era of Mark Spitz Burt Reynolds and old-time porn flicks. And he struts around with the blissfully misinformed idea that women just love it when you rub up against them and describe their desirability in hunting terms. Oh man do they get turned on when you treat em like prey Rons a prisoner of his times encouraged by his trio of moronic colleagues sportscaster Champ Kind (David Koechner) news reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd) and weatherman Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) who are always looking for a party which means women. And Rons world gets a rough shakedown when the talented ambitious Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) who possesses actual journalistic skills (as opposed to the ability to read from a teleprompter) gets hired as his assistant anchor. Rons whole career and belief system are about to be shaken to their roots. And being the ladies man he is he cant help falling madly in love with her. ""Breathtaking heinie"" says Ron when he first meets Veronica at that point not realizing shes a news journalist and about to be his professional competitor. ""I want to be friends with it."" Amazingly and heres where the story gets too silly even by its own standards Veronica finds herself attracted to Ron. (He never has to really earn her love.) A first date becomes instant love and affection. And the smitten Ron cant help announcing his conquest on the evening news. This upsets Veronica but not as much as Rons complete lack of faith in her abilities. When push comes to shove he doesnt believe in her. Written by Ferrell and director Andy McKay (a former ""Saturday Night Live"" writer) ""Anchorman"" which has amusing turns from Applegate as well as Vince Vaughn as one of Rons on-air anchor rivals is more goofy than inspired. It rests largely on the likable funniness of Ferrell and his bag of unexpected tricks. On that first date with Veronica for instance he whips out a flute and leads a jazz combo with wild inspiration. (Just happened to have the flute in his inside jacket pocket.) And when Ron is forced to leave the station apparently banished for the rest of his professional life he makes a desperate call to his buddy Brian from an enclosed telephone booth. ""Where are you?"" Brian asks. ""Im in a glass case of emotion"" wails Ron. The movie (which includes one dog-kicking scene guaranteed to lightly goose the PETA crowd) closes with the long-cliched tradition of showing ""hilarious"" outtakes from the movie during the closing credits. Dont worry You wont have to linger for them. But ""Anchorman"" does leave you with a strong asset Ferrell is a charming character you want to see again. Ron is funnier and more appealing than the story hes in. And in a strange way the movie sets itself up (A  la ""Austin Powers"") with the possibility of a sequel that could outdo the original. Theres a future in all this. Maybe. ANCHORMAN THE LEGEND OF RON BURGUNDY (PG-13 91 minutes) -- Contains cartoonish violence to an animal some obscenity sexual situations and banter and (brace yourselves) an entire rendition of ""Afternoon Delight.""

"On the Spot News washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies On the Spot News Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 9 2004 Over the past century film geniuses have erected many a cathedral of style solemn structures of tradition and cohesion the highest projection of the imagination Swedish Realism German Expressionism Spanish Poetic Realism Italian Neorealism Danish Dogmatism. To this hallowed list does Will Ferrells ""Anchorman"" petition for admission. Its contribution San Diego Neo-Infantilism. Are you listening Cahiers du Cinema? Anyhow the movie which is extremely funny might be said to represent a triumph of tone over sense. Its a skit but so ingeniously constructed and convincingly executed that it manages to sustain its energy far beyond sketch length. It never becomes tedious and strained as did another recent exercise of high stylization ""Down With Love."" The fundamental premise of ""Anchorman"" is that men are babies. Its set in a universe of bald demand for instant gratification extreme bitterness when denied and worst of all not enough drape in the lapels. Its basic philosophical position might be summed up as Waaaaah me want me need me important me fabulous waaaaaah And those are the 40-year-olds. It hews brilliantly to that line only rarely breaking mood never losing its nerve and always generating humor. Its certainly the role that Ferrell was born to play It caters exactly to his strengths -- the hyper-exaggerated mannerisms of the ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch -- and avoids his weaknesses which would be something called ""replicating believable human behavior."" Ferrell is cast as Ron Burgundy anchorman of the leading local news team in Californias loveliest city a man of such charisma that his bravado sign-off line -- ""San Diego stay classy"" -- has become a source of civic pride. This anchorman -- and so many others of that era -- with his floppy mop of ruddy hair firm chin ball-bearing eyes warming basso profundo is the center of the zeitgeist up there with quarterbacks and talk show hosts as culture heroes. Hes so overwhelming that nobody has yet noted that hes really really stupid. The time is the early 70s that demimonde of wide tie bell-bottom slacks stripe dot and check a plasticized zing to fabric sideburns like spear points cool jazz all this under the guidance of the ages leading guru the all-wise all-seeing Hugh Hefner. ""Anchorman"" includes it all except the monstrous Hefner a surprising lack. Directed by ""SNL"" veteran writer Adam McKay (who co-wrote the film with Ferrell) ""Anchorman"" watches with abject fascination the arrival of that new thing to the male-dominated workplace the woman professional. The woman is Veronica Corningstone (the underrated Christina Applegate) the new reporter with anchor aspirations and when she arrives in fluffy girlie clothes of the time under a feathery frost of Farrah hair who would suspect the revolution had just begun? But shes smart classy talented beautiful -- and the boys cant wait to accidentally brush up against her. The movie is ruthless about the casual predominance of sexual harassment as a workplace style in those years after the advent of the birth control pill but before the arrival quite of feminism. The source of much mirth in ""Anchorman"" isnt just the self-deluding Burgundy himself -- though Ferrell is typically brilliant at projecting a character without a shred of inner life or self-awareness -- but also his little coterie of on-air stud boys. They see themselves as four horsemen outlined against a diamond-blue eternal April sky but of course theyre really four horses asses on a one-way trip toward oblivion. Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd with his own Royal Air Force mustache; why did guys then think that was so cool?) is Mr. Cologne; he knows the right man-perfume dabbed on his neck gets him to chick heaven. Steven Carell is Brick Tamland the weatherman whose IQ approaches that of the object for which hes named and whose continual inability to understand reality is endlessly funny. Finally sports guy Champ Kind (David Koechner) wears ten-gallon hats makes poo-poo faces and boo-boo sound effects for comic relief among the guys (how unfunny they are is really funny) and is secretly gay. The men fight the ascension of Veronica and the new woman she represents; the joke is how ridiculously inefficient their campaign is and how utterly its ignored by station management (Fred Willard and Chris Parnell). The guys it turns out have no chops no arguments no resources no skills nothing except the maleness that has been at the center of their entitlement their whole lives. Its a particularly brilliant conceit the dumb fighting the inevitable under the impression that theyre noble not dumb. Some of the episodes are a little less effective than others. A fantasy fight among news teams somewhat breaks the mood and Rons collapse after catastrophe while never meant to be confused with Swedish Realism still feels a little overdone to me. But the reality of the movie can be summed up crisply You will laugh. Then you will laugh some more. Then you will laugh still again. Anchorman (91 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for mock violence and endless immature sex jokes.

Directed by Adam McKay from a screenplay by Ferrell and McKay. 91 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sexual humor language and comic violence. Several theaters. The key to ""Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" a sketchy film in every sense of the word can be found in a small but crucial role played by a worried-looking little dog named Baxter. Its not that he does much -- the pooch whimpers wears an orthodontic device saves his master from a dreadful fate; basic doggie stuff -- but his name resonates. Its a hint that the filmmakers just might be aware that nearly every funny bit in their movie has been done before -- by airhead anchorman Ted Baxter played by Ted Knight in the 70s TV series ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show."" The parallels between Ted Baxter and Ron Burgundy (played by Will Ferrell who also co-wrote the screenplay with director Adam McKay) are many. Both anchor local news shows and dream of network fame; both have the brain power of a carpenter ant; both fancy themselves as ladies men with their poufy hair white shoes and shiny plaid jackets; both have an inflated opinion of their own talents. And both will without hesitation read aloud on the air whatever script is given to them however inappropriate -- they lack the ability to self-edit. (Burgundys San Diego station is well-heeled enough to have a TelePrompTer; Baxters Minneapolis studio had to make do with cardboard cue cards.) So the under-30 target audience of ""Anchorman"" should know that theres nothing remotely original here and while the film is sporadically funny it was done much better on the small screen decades ago. And the story here is barely enough to fill the ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch that this movie resembles. Burgundy along with his news team -- reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd) sportscaster Champ Kind (David Koechner) and weatherman Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) the dimmest bulb in this already twilit box -- are appalled when a woman newscaster Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) joins them. Theres the grain of a decent idea here and its a bit funny to watch the guys alternating between shameless pickup techniques (one involving the application of a cologne called ""Sex Panther"") and sophomoric jokes such as trying to make their new colleague crack up on the air by making silly faces at her. (The ever-professional Veronica played with cool precision by Applegate barely raises an eyebrow.) But thats all the movie is and eventually it just becomes shameless and sophomoric without the laughs. Ferrell whos one of those love-him-or-hate-him performers gives a performance that feels mostly improvised waggling his blocky mustache and talking in funny voices. He has a kind of blank regular-guy quality that suited his innocent role in ""Elf"" but fits less well here; Rons a dork without depth and you quickly get tired of him. Fred Willard blustering agreeably as the station manager might have been a better fit for the lead role -- picture a slightly hipper variant on Willards agreeably asinine dog-show announcer in ""Best in Show."" And a gaggle of Very Famous Comic Actors turn up in unbilled -- and underwhelming -- cameo roles presumably to demonstrate that they have plenty of time on their hands. (I wont name them; the movies got few enough surprises.) Fans of Ferrells style of comedy will likely have a decent time here if they crunch their popcorn loud enough to drown out the screenplay. Others will go home with fond thoughts of Ted Baxter realizing that everything old doesnt have to be new again.

Photo Frank Masi Flip the channel on Anchorman a comedy sketch stretched too far 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgundy Comedy. Starring Will Ferrell and ChristinaApplegate. Directed by Adam McKay. (PG-13. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" is a comic idea that never finds the comic wellspring or anything resembling a sure source for laughs. From the beginning the struggle is apparent -- to keep hammering together comic bits just to keep things moving another five minutes another 10. About half the time all this struggling pays off. Though always sophomoric and sometimes bland ""Anchorman"" is also intermittently funny with just enough laughs (but only just enough) to keep an audience rooting for it. The movies strenuous pursuit of comic moments in fact becomes a comic strategy in itself. Theres a scene in which Will Ferrell as the vain and empty-headed Ron Burgundy is mourning the loss of his pet dog. He calls a co- worker from a pay phone sobbing and shrieking and its supposed to be funny but its not really. But Ferrell keeps it going sobbing louder shrieking louder flailing in the phone booth taking the moment past exaggeration and past absurdity into some comedy version of outer space. He gets his laugh. Ferrell has to work this hard because ""Anchorman"" is a satire without much truth or perception behind it and therefore no satiric kick. Its 1977 and Ron rules the air as the No. 1 newsman in San Diego. Its an entirely male enclave until the news director brings in Veronica (Christina Applegate) a newswoman from North Carolina. That one little shift brings about the gradual unraveling of Rons world. Though the on-camera newsmen in ""Anchorman"" are outraged at the thought of a female newswoman women were hardly a TV news novelty in 1977. There were many female reporters some of them major stars locally and nationally. And although sexism no doubt existed the out-of-control boorishness displayed by the men in ""Anchorman"" is too outlandish to have even a satirical relationship with fact. Its more in the realm of shock-comedy vulgarity and is too obvious to be funny. The movie is better when it abandons all pretense of satire and veers straight for the ridiculous as when the splendor of Ron and Veronicas lovemaking is depicted via a colorful animated sequence. In another scene all the local news teams meet in an empty lot and rumble including representatives of the Spanish station and the local PBS station. To be accurate what lift the latter scene are lots of unexpected celebrity cameos which seems to be a trend these days If you cant write jokes just have celebrities show up to fill out minor roles. The screenplay is mostly disappointing. When his co-workers ask Ron what love is like the audience waits for some funny response. What it gets is Ferrell singing ""Afternoon Delight"" with his friends singing harmony. Paul Rudd is wasted as field reporter Brian Fontana a role that makes him seem coarse without giving him a chance to be funny. The same goes for David Koechner as sportscaster Champ Kind. But Steve Carell is a blast as weatherman Brick Tamland in an irresistibly conceived part Brick has an IQ of only 48 but no one knows it. Thats why for example when pressed to come up with an insulting rejoinder the best he can manage is ""Where did you get the old clothes in the toilet store?"" ""Anchorman"" is most sure-footed in the scenes between Applegate and Ferrell with her playing deadpan straight woman to his clown. When he tries to impress her with the origin of the name San Diego or banters artificially with her on the set the film perks up. And the running gag of Rons helpless inability not to read whatever is on the TelePrompTer provides a couple of comic highlights. Still ""Anchorman"" feels like an extended skit stretched and stretched maybe not to the breaking point but to the sagging point. -- Advisory This film contains sex banter and sexual situations.

"Reilly Ferrell are more like the wrong Brothers - USATODAY.com Cars  Auto Financing  Event Tickets  Jobs  Real Estate  Online Degrees Shopping SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Life >> Movies Box Office Report Movie Listings Awards Central Shop for Movies/DVDs Reilly Ferrell are more like the wrong Brothers Updated  | Comment  | Recommend E-mail | Print | Enlarge By Mark Seliger Columbia Pictures Amigos in argyle But Will Ferrell left and John C. Reilly hate each other at first when their parents get married. ABOUT THE MOVIEStep Brothers (out of four)Stars Will Ferrell John C. Reilly Richard Jenkins Mary SteenburgenDirector Adam McKayDistributor Columbia PicturesRating R for crude and sexual content and pervasive languageRunning time 1 hour 35 minutesOpens Friday nationwide SUMMER MOVIE GUIDE By Claudia Puig USA TODAY America loves dysfunctional families but havent we seen enough middle-aged losers who havent grown up? We know Will Ferrell can carry a hilarious movie (Anchorman) as can John C. Reilly (the underrated Walk Hard). And Ferrell and Reilly do have considerable comic chemistry together as we saw in Talladega Nights. So that raises our hopes for this second joint effort. Adding to high expectations an eclectic supporting cast with Richard Jenkins (The Visitor) as Reillys father (and Ferrells stepfather) and Mary Steenburgen as Ferrells mom (and Reillys stepmother). Adam Scott has some sharply humorous moments as Ferrells brother though his character gets old fast. The concept is inherently funny Each is a self-absorbed brat living at home sponging off his parent and generally acting like an overgrown 13-year-old. When their single parents fall in love and marry they are forced to share a room. They squabble bond job-hunt and cause problems with their parents. But the plot grows thin and the laughs grow fewer once the premise is established. One problem the stepbrothers similarity. They come off as almost the same person so generating conflict becomes nearly impossible. Certifiably funny bits are interspersed with juvenile jokes centering on bathroom habits flatulence and vomiting. It seems Ferrell and Reilly are having lots of fun but thats not always communicated to the audience. Some gags go on too long or are simply too forced. A scene at the dinner table featuring all the family has some funny moments but it doesnt come close to the hilarity of the extended dinner in Talladega (with the infamous discussion of baby Jesus and grace). Like a few other comedies in recent memory this feels it should have been a Saturday Night Live skit rather than a full-length film.

"Anchorman good news and bad. Slate Sign In Sign Up Anchorman good news and bad. Anchorman good news and bad. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 8 2004 531 PM Triumph of the Will Anchorman is messy crude and brilliant. By David Edelstein Laugh like this idiot Watching Anchorman (DreamWorks) took me back to a night in the 70s when the local anchorman sat one table away from my family at a restaurant. It was between the 6 oclock and 11 oclock news so he had traces of caramel pancake make-up. But it was the guys hair that I couldnt take my eyes off so wavy and luxuriant and dark and confident like his voice which had such booming resonance you could hear it all over the restaurant--whether you wanted to or not. No ordinary mortal was in our midst. Even if all he did was read other peoples words off a TelePrompTer the camera invested this boob with the kind of authority that made him seem more real than any of us. Anchorman comes on as a satire of this kind of 70s local celebrity--who loomed even larger back then a prologue reminds us when we were stuck with maybe three local stations and PBS. Will Ferrell who co-wrote the movie with the director Adam McKay plays Ron Burgundy one of those helmet-hair anchors and a swaggering San Diego demigod. Everyone from infants to bikers watches Burgundy in awe. Were in awe too although for different reasons. It might have something to do with those thick dark eyebrows and that heavy caterpillar mustache that doesnt quite make it up to the bottom of his nose The macho grooming doesnt go with the baby face. When he struts around shirtless fancying himself quite the babe magnet his sparse chest hair dry and curly the lack of any visible musculature is breathtaking. His attempt at seducing Christina Applegate as the stations new hire Veronica Corningstone is the first of the movies many gross-outs. When his braggadocio doesnt work Burgundy stammers lamely ""I want to be ... on you."" He cant understand why she doesnt regard this as the luckiest day of her life. Advertisement Burgundy is a macho dinosaur waiting for his feminist comeuppance and it comes when Veronica is named co-anchor of the evening news. The movie is about their ferocious love-hate relationship and about the way Veronicas success empowers the subservient women at the station. Its about a love that somehow transcends the age-old battle of the sexes-- No scratch that. Anchorman is about pushing the outside of the envelope. Pushing it all the way to Pluto. You have to imagine a narrative structure that is extremely conventional Beat by beat the movie could be that awful Robert Redford-Michelle Pfeiffer picture Up Close and Personal (1996). Ferrell and McKay take that template and add jokes. They add jokes so broad that scene after scene goes past dumb past unreal and into some stratosphere of camp that throws you totally out of the movie. Manly men discussing love break unselfconsciously into a dainty pop tune then snap back into their brusque man-talk. Burgundy and his sports guy (David Koechner) and weatherman (Steve Carell) and investigative reporter (Paul Rudd) cross paths with rival anchor teams like street gangs They trade insults about toilets and their mothers and in one spectacular sequence packed with star cameos they go at it with guns and knives and medieval instruments. Youre not laughing at anchormen. Youre laughing at formula movie rituals blown sky-high. Ferrell has that self-intoxicated jiggle of the head down pat but he isnt one of those natural clowns with rubbery features and an infinitely moldable body. His timing isnt the sharpest; hes not a virtuoso. But he gets huge laughs because hes not afraid to take a joke to the next level the way the Marx Brothers always did. No Anchorman doesnt have that kind of linguistic sophistication--although its often wonderfully deft as when Burgundy greets his date Veronica with the line ""It truly is beauty and the beast--and a handsome beast at that."" The movie has a free-associational quality and something else an atmosphere of fooling around and taking chances. This grab-bag approach has an amazing cumulative power so that the frequent clunkers dont matter Youre finally just relaxed and happy grooving on the cast and waiting to get smacked with the next outlandish gag. It should be said that Anchorman is a shockingly ugly movie and that the lighting does no favors for Christina Applegate whose face is weirdly tight in some shots. Its preoccupations are smutty and infantile its targets obvious. Yet it strides above its crudeness like a colossus. Its smart people telling dumb jokes with a brilliant sense of irony. Anchorman gives you permission to laugh like an idiot. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

"Anchorman | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; anchorman ) Anchorman (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli There was a time long before cable and VCRs when live local news was one of the biggest commodities television stations had to sell. During this era news anchors were judged far less by their journalistic skills than by their ability to convey trustworthiness. After all we invited these men into our homes every evening and believed every word they spoke. What we perhaps did not recognize was that these men were often petty and egotistical and their sole redeeming qualities were that they could look good on camera and read flawlessly from a teleprompter. Such a man was Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) the immensely popular anchor of San Diegos Channel 4 evening news. Anchorman is a very funny motion picture but it also has a good sense of the time (the 1970s) and how the medium of TV news was changing. Like Network and Broadcast News the film turns a satirical eye towards the behind-the-scenes goings-on at a station. Anchorman is more over-the-top and intentionally silly than either of the aforementioned movies but it still makes the point. In addition it explores how difficult a period it was for serious women journalists with on-air aspirations. Here the Jessica Savitch-type is Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) who encounters a wall of male chauvinism on her way to becoming KVWNs first female anchorperson. And the strongest opposition comes from Ron Burgundy who along with his cohorts insists that news is a mans world. All of this is presented in the most farcical manner imaginable but its possible to get a sense of what it was like for women in this industry during the 70s. (Four notable local long-time anchors were used as consultants for the film so the sense of verisimilitude underlying the satire is well-founded.) As the movie opens we are informed ""The following is based on actual events. Only the names locations and events have been changed."" Anchorman then introduces Ron and the other members of the KVWM news team sports reporter Champ Kind (David Koechner) weatherman Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) and on-the-spot reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd). They represent the 1 news team in San Diego but the arrival of Veronica Corningstone is about to stir the pot. At first station manager Ed Harken (Fred Willard) gives her ""puff pieces"" but when Ron is late for a broadcast one evening she fills in and is such a hit that she and Ron are soon co-anchors. To add fuel to the fire they become romantically involved then split when Ron views her career ambitions as a betrayal. With his two previous movies Old School and Elf Will Ferrell has shown a maturation of his comedy from Saturday Night Live fare to something more suited to the big screen. (That is to say it has become funny.) Although still heavily reliant upon sophomoric gags and innuendo there is an underlying level of sophistication to what Ferrell does. Granted no one would call this ""intellectual comedy"" but its not as dumb as it first appears to be. With Anchorman Ferrell has found a happy medium between the family friendliness of Elf and the R-rated outrageousness of Old School. Frrell carries the movie on his broad shoulders nailing the character perfectly. He becomes Ron the shallow-but-photogenic anchorman whose back-stage pettiness contradicts his on-screen friendliness. And even though Ron is a chauvinist Ferrell brings out his likeability. Christina Applegate is an effective foil. Her part as the only woman in an otherwise all-male news team is mirrored by her being the only significant female in the cast. Theres just enough chemistry between her and Ferrell to allow the love story to work. Effective support is provided by Paul Rudd as the station Lothario David Koechner as a guy who doesnt know much other than sports and Steve Carell as a twit with an IQ of 40. The comedic centerpiece of Anchorman is a no-holds-barred rumble between San Diegos various anchor teams. With cameos by Vince Vaughn Tim Robbins Ben Stiller and Luke Wilson this is as funny and memorable a scene as any in Anchorman. It requires something of a macabre sense of humor to fully appreciate this tussle since theres one death and a dismemberment. Of course its all played for laughs. Anchormans satirical bent makes the comedy seem richer. One of the areas where the film has fun is in choosing character names. We have great theatrical-sounding monikers like Ron Burgundy Veronica Corningstone Brick Tamland Champ Kind and Wes Mantooth. I wonder how long it took Ferrell and co-writer/director Adam McKay (a behind-the-scenes SNL alum making his feature debut) to come up with those? Its hard to say whether Anchorman is the funniest movie of the year - it has enough offbeat and gut-busting moments to make it worth consideration in that category. And Anchorman would certainly make a great double-feature with Dodgeball another of 2004s most enjoyable comedies.

For those convinced local TV news long ago graduated from parody to self-parody ""Anchorman"" nevertheless wrings ample laughs from that milieu and the big-haired 1970s fast becoming our most-lampooned decade. Although at times pic feels like an extended ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch from the shows invariably flabby last half-hour collaborators Will Ferrell and Adam McKay generate enough inspired lunacy to sail past the arid stretches and provide a welcome splash of breezy at times jaw-droppingly bizarre summer fun. Given the current appetite for zanier comedies such as ""DodgeBall"" the box office forecast should be as sunny as a day in San Diego. Still a somewhat unlikely figure to sustain a film ""Elf"" notwithstanding Ferrell has seized on a clever concept rife with possibilities -- namely women breaking the glass ceiling in male-dominated TV news during the 70s -- and smartly surrounded himself with a topnotch cast. Ferrell plays Ron Burgundy San Diegos reigning anchor god presented as a more libidinous take on ""The Mary Tyler Moore Shows"" Ted Baxter. Life is good for Ron and his news team -- sports guy Champ Kind (David Koechner) field reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd) and weatherman Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) -- one long pool party of booze broads and sweeps victories. Then along comes the ambitious Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) invading and eventually upending their perfect little world. Even the newscasts producer Ed (the reliable if predictable Fred Willard) titters at Veronica behind her back assigning her inane stories like a cat costume contest. Despite her protestations about maintaining professional decorum Veronica and Ron fall for each other. Yet when an unforeseen (and hilarious) event detains Ron Veronica is forced to fill in for him inevitably becoming an overnight smash and prompting Ed to install her as co-anchor much to the chauvinistic chagrin of Ron and his posse. Former ""SNL"" head writer Adam McKay makes his feature directing and writing debut (teaming on the script with Ferrell) and theyve peppered the action with outlandish flights of fancy from an animated dream sequence to a melee among competing news teams. (The scene allows for several of the films uncredited cameos by the likes of Vince Vaughn and Luke Wilson though for the most part they pay off only in a momentary giggle when the actors first appear.) Not all of the broader shtick works but some of it proves explosively funny -- especially Carell (hilarious on ""The Daily Show"" but often underutilized elsewhere) as the brain-dead weather dude who in direct-to-camera asides confesses to having ""an IQ of 48"" and Koechner as the sexually conflicted sportscaster. Ferrell unleashes any number of giddy moments as well from Burgundys absolute insistence on regaling Veronica with bogus facts to his strange ejaculations (""By the beard of Zeus"") which receive an even fuller airing during the outtakes that accompany the closing credits. Pic also adds impeccable little touches that capture the period from an impromptu chorus of ""Afternoon Delight"" to the moustaches sideburns and deafeningly loud jackets that only slightly exaggerate the ""Eyewitness News"" formula of that era. In that sense ""Anchorman"" does a better job spoofing the 70s than many recent TV-inspired knockoffs that have tried as much tonally resembling a bawdier version of ""The Brady Bunch"" films more than anything else. As an aside a handful of TV news people including Bill Kurtis and KNBC-TV weatherman Fritz Coleman are acknowledged in the credits ""for their insight into the world of broadcast journalism."" Local TV outlets are already having a ball with ""Anchorman"" yet in terms of Burgundys dead-behind-the-eyes look while reading off a TelePrompTer that might be the one group for which all this merriment strikes just a bit too close to home.
