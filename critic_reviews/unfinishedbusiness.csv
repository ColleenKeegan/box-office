"Small(er) Movie Roundup Because Cinderella Cant Have Everything << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Small(er) Movie Roundup Because Cinderella Cant Have Everything TWC Radius Movies March 17 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print It Follows directed by David Robert Mitchell Right now the campus-sexual-assault documentary The Hunting Ground is bringing people to tears and outraging universities with its incriminating concentration of dire statistics and accounts from activist survivors. Theres no breaking news just an overwhelming seemingly insurmountable wall of anecdotes concerning a staggering number of alleged rapes administrative cover-ups denials and meager punishments. That film got eerie company last week from It Follows a slasher film of sorts with a great name and a chilling metaphorical handle on sex and assault. What it lacks in actual slashing it makes up for in atmosphere. Most of it evokes the attacks on lust that flourished in Alfred Hitchcocks Psycho and The Birds and that were rampant in the high school nightmare movies of the 1970s and 1980s. It Follows is set in a suburban Detroit where teens are raised on a steady diet of old science fiction and monster movies with nary a parent in sight. Jay (Maika Monroe) thinks shes on a fun date with Hugh (Jake Weary) only to discover after she wakes up tied to a wheelchair in her underwear that shed been chloroformed and driven to an empty parking lot. Its a date from hell. Shes been cursed Hugh tells her because they had sex. Something is going to keep following her in various human forms until she either passes the curse to someone else through intercourse or the curse kills her. Indeed theres a naked woman chasing them in the lot -- Hughs previous date. As an allegory this is surprisingly free of glibness. Mitchell merges the grim adolescent rites of horror movies with the grisly risks of having a libido at any age. (The men and women chasing her range in age and size and beauty.) The horror of the scenario is as much emotional as it is visceral -- maybe more so given the amount of time the film shows the kids just sitting around bored. Like Jennifer Kents crazier more grandiose The Babadook from last year Mitchell turns post-traumatic stress into a kind of schlock art. It Follows dares to personify the anxiety around such disparate subjects as arousal assault and sexually transmitted disease and make them supernatural. Because a lot of what is going on here scary-movie-wise has been well established by scores of other films Mitchell doesnt have to overdo the social commentary. The anonymous metaphysical stalking is its own comment. Laurie Sparham/Fox Searchlight The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel directed by John Madden Not far into this sequel to the 2012 hit Judi Dench explains to an Indian scarf vendor why shes chosen him as opposed to his competitors (something about the quality of his silk). She does so with the delicacy used to put a child to sleep. When shes done the vendor gives her a warm bath of a look and does the equivalent of wrapping her in a towel. ""Thank you for your respect"" he all but sings. As preemptive disclaimers go its right up there with ""based on a true story"" and "" you wouldnt really hit a guy with glasses would you?"" This one says ""Be kind to us. We harmed no Indians in the making of this movie."" But for a film like this -- in which a handful of British people ransack Jaipur with their heartaches verbal sniping and doctors visits -- some recognition of the narrative imbalance is merited. The whole movie is caught somewhere between apology and entitlement. But Madden and writer Ol Parker keep the plots lubricated with mild geriatric comedy that Maggie Smith Celia Imrie Bill Nighy and Ronald Pickup among others can play without much heavy lifting. (Nighy barely has to enunciate as he tries to make Dench commit to him.) There are more story lines and coincidences than there are people in Jaipur. Even Richard Gere is now on the scene as an American who claims hes writing a book and whom Imrie already drowning in Indian suitors sees as another potential snack. But Sonny (Dev Patel) the proprietor of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel where the old white Brits have all moved swears that Gere is there evaluating Sonnys suitability for an Exotic Marigold franchise. Most of the plots concern Sonnys upcoming wedding to Sunaina (Tina Desai) whos annoyed that Sonny would rather flatter Gere than rehearse the reception dance. Sonnys jealous of Sunainas family friend who just bought the building Sonny was eying for his expansion. Patels the one doing all the lifting (hes about a third of Smiths age). Most of what hes picking up is Indian kitsch. He doesnt seem to know how demeaning all of this obsequiousness appears. But its the situation hes playing not the ""yes boss"" fawning. And some of his situations are actually funny. Some are not. One character is gravely ill. And Penelope Wilton returns as Nighys toxic wife Jean -- she practically is a disease. You watch it all in a state of amused disgust. This isnt the will to live. Its mortis interruptus. Twentieth Century Fox Unfinished Business directed by Ken Scott Tom Wilkinson was the best thing about the original Marigold Hotel. His character came out of the closet then died. Now instead of frolicking in Jaipur Wilkinson is in a flat confused Vince Vaughn comedy about three generations of businessmen fighting for a bacon-saving deal (Dave Franco is the rookie). One mild strength of the Marigold Hotel movies is that it knows what it is and who its for. This movie directed by Ken Scott has no idea. It needs a director who can handle the mix of the bizarre the raucous and the conventional the collision of tequila slaps keg stands G8 protest riots and Sienna Miller as an American business sniper. But come on. The only person whod know how to get a single movie out of scenes that include Vaughn talking to penises that droop out of glory holes at a German leather bar then FaceTiming with his outcast Midwestern tweens might be John Waters whod never go near Steven Conrads script. The movie either needs to be a carnival or a Jack Lemmon-style scenery-chewing drama. Instead its a pebble at the bottom of the vast canyon between the two. The domestic scenes feel at odds with say Francos latest erect-penis trick and the ongoing misuse of the wonderful Nick Frost here doing more of his poor-fat-me bit. The movie gets dumber and more desperate as it goes. By Vaughns track record this counts as another turkey like 2013s Delivery Man also directed by Scott. But I didnt leave either movie convinced the problem is Vaughn. The talkaholic lunatic act that made him famous is aging into a place of comedic stability. Hes now the least crazy least naughty person in his films and that has made him a fascinating actor. The best scenes in this movie put Vaughn in a German art installation that simulates a businessmans hotel-office (please dont ask). In front of an audience Vaughn takes calls and explains his job going from reluctance to open participation. As long as hes running his mouth and keeping his cool hes a star. Otherwise a movie like this misses the point of Vince Vaughn. Even when it seems as though hes being allowed to stretch theres nothing in the material to challenge him. Until he has another shot to reestablish contact with a dark side (the late 1990s -- Clay Pigeons Psycho -- seem like a hundred years ago) hes languishing in generic straight man parts. As a comedic performer hes a hall-of-fame wingman. He either needs to find better worthier experiments (like the upcoming second round of True Detective) or the movies need to let him fly again.

"Unfinished Business | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; unfinished-business ) Unfinished Business (United States 2015) March 07 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Unfinished Business is bad - not epically bad but bad enough. Little contained in this misfire of a film works and the few successful things are dragged out to the point where they die a lingering death. In fact its odd that this movie was accorded a major theatrical berth. It lacks a ""big name"" star (Vince Vaughn although recognizable has been slipping farther from the A-list with every release) and the pedigree of its director Ken Scott (the lackluster Delivery Man also with Vaughn) is questionable at best. Better movies end up with a direct ticket to VOD. I wish that had been the case with Unfinished Business because then I would have 91 minutes of my life back. One of the films evident problems is that it suffers from an identity crisis. It doesnt know what it wants to be a raunchy comedy about three guys let loose in Berlin during a big gay pride festival or a weepy drama about how parental neglect can result in troubled offspring. Unfinished Business humor is low-key for this material except during a couple of scenes when it pushes the R-ratings unclear envelope with what the MPAA likes to call ""graphic nudity."" The movie is rarely funny - a lot of the jokes dont work or are extended beyond the point where theyre amusing - but there are times when the lack of comedy is by design because the filmmakers mistakenly believe they are crafting a sweet sincere drama. Unfortunately the material so trite and obvious that even Lifetime would reject it. Its certainly possible for a comedy to make serious points but a little more honesty and considerably less artifice is required for such an endeavor to work. Unfinished Business takes the very serious business of high school and internet bullying and trivializes it by reducing it to a plot point and stepping stone to a happy ending. The production doesnt get one star only because of its infantile script and unremarkable performances but because it addresses this issue in such an objectionable manner. Theres not much to the narrative. The only thing surprising about Unfinished Business is how little is surprising. A group of three ad men - ambitious Dan Trunkman (Vaughn); over-the-hill unhappily married Tim McWinters (Tom Wilkinson); and mentally challenged (in a Brick Tamland way) youngster Mike Pancake (Dave Franco) - decide to form a start up and go head-to-head with Dans previous employer Chuck Portnoy (Sienna Miller) in securing a major contract with a firm headed by Brit Bill Whilmsley (Nick Frost) and Yankee Jim Spinch (James Marsden). This requires them to travel from their home base in St. Louis to Portland Maine to Berlin. The end up in Germany in the midst of three big events the G8 Oktoberfest and a gay rights festival. Things happen involving naked women gloryholes a visit to a unisex sauna and Facetime chats between Dan and his kids that reveal troubling signs. Vince Vaughn is probably better than the material but I find myself thinking that about a lot of his films which have a distressing quality of sameness to them flaccid dramas masquerading as ""outrageous"" comedies. Vaughns most successful outings have been those in which he has curbed his sentimental tendencies. Its not that he cant be a capable dramatic actor given the right material but Unfinished Business isnt right for anyone... certainly not an Oscar-caliber performer like Tom Wilkinson. Wilkinson appears to have been relegated to the ""Betty White role"" here except while White garners chuckles for dropping an F-bomb the same cant be said of Wilkinson. Dave Franco is annoying and seems stoned for the duration but Im willing to blame that on the screenwriter and director. It is often rightly argued that comedy is subjective - one person may laugh uncontrollably at something another finds tedious. Unfinished Business however may represent the rare case in which ""bad comedy"" crosses over from subjective to objective. No matter what a viewers taste its hard to imagine anyone - even someone not offended by the treatment of bullied children and their oblivious parents - showing much enthusiasm for Unfinished Business. Its not awful enough to belong on an all-time ""worst"" list but its a strong candidate for 2015s bottom-of-the-barrel roster.

Photo Credit 20th Century Fox / Jessica Miglio advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Three businessmen take an important trip that goes awry. (Rated R) BOTTOM LINE Shallow dimwitted and inept. Makes ""The Hangover"" look like ""Glengarry Glen Ross."" CAST Vince Vaughn Dave Franco Tom Wilkinson LENGTH 130 With luck we will look back at ""Unfinished Business"" as the film that finally killed the studios appetite for raunchy rip-offs of 2009s ""The Hangover."" That R-rated hit has been reworked for women as ""Bridesmaids"" for teens as ""Project X"" and for seniors as ""Last Vegas"" but ""Unfinished Business"" just reworks it period. Without ""The Hangover"" as a reference point it would be difficult to say what this movie was trying to be. It opens with a tense scene in which Vince Vaughn as salesman Dan Trunkman quits his job to start his own company. Leaving with him are Tim McWinters (Tom Wilkinson) a newly fired 67-year-old and young Mike Pancake (Dave Franco) a dim bulb who was only there for an interview. Together they form the upstart company Apex. Their office is a nearby Dunkin Donuts. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Were initially on board with these underdogs as they go up against Dans old company to land a massive account (Nick Frost and James Marsden play good-suit/bad-suit). Our goodwill ends though as the trios international business trip begins and we get to know them better. Dan is a workaholic unaware that his children (Britton Sear and Ella Anderson) are clinically depressed. Tim is a sex-starved coot who loathes his wife (""she looks like a vending machine""). Mike is actually a mentally impaired adult living in a group home -- which as a joke seems truly nasty. Right here ""Unfinished Business"" loses our sympathy. More movie reviewsLatest movie reviews Comedies in this genre often tone themselves down for a PG-13 rating but ""Unfinished Business"" does the opposite Its a timid movie trying to be outrageous. Director Ken Scott (Vaughns ""Delivery Man"") and writer Steve Conrad (Ben Stillers ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"") dutifully include scenes of sex and drugs but their hearts arent in it. Their judgment becomes increasingly questionable A gay leather-bar for instance feels like yesterdays shocker while the violent G-8 summit protests in Berlin are clearly the wrong place for slapstick. The three leads have their charms but Sienna Miller as their archrival -- weirdly named Chuck Portnoy -- is terribly miscast only because she seems so smart and capable that we begin rooting for her. Unless we want a sequel lets hope ""Unfinished Business"" ends up deeply in the red. _____ advertisement | advertise on newsday PLOT Three businessmen take an important trip that goes awry.

This time as Dan Trunkman hes one year into running his own company Apex Select with Mike Pancake (Dave Franco) a slow-witted socially challenged whippersnapper and Timothy McWinters (Tom Wilkinson) whos not quite ready for retirement. Dan believes hes finally landed the deal thatll launch the company to a new level--all he needs to do is fly the team to Portland to shake hands and finalize the terms. But once Dan learns that his former boss (Sienna Miller) is in town competing for the same partnership hard-ass executive Jim Spinch (James Marsden) and his right-hand man Bill Whilmsley (Nick Frost) suggest the trio present directly to their parent company in Germany if they want to seal the deal. Once in Berlin we expect the ""business trip of a lifetime"" as the movie is billed to finally begin. But instead of an all-out raunch-fest we get a tonal mess that jumbles elements of PG-rated fare with Eurotrip-esque shenanigans. Frequent FaceTime calls from Dans family interrupt the action clashing with other moments such as 67-year-old Tim discussing his desire to try wheelbarrowing. Somewhat randomly Unfinished Business embraces the anti-bullying cause with Dan attempting to explain the evils of bullying to his children during via FaceTime. Soft-spoken Mike even opens up about the realities of bullying but the real talk and shots of Tim taking bong hits in the background dilute each other and add up to less than the sum of their parts. The movie struggles to find its comedic footing by trying to bring out the family man in Dan Trunkman and underutilizing Franco whose character clearly has much more to his disadvantage than a lack of prior business experience. Bottom line Unfinished Business doesnt deserve that handshake after all.

When Vaughns Dan Trunkman is pushed too far by his domineering boss (Sienna Miller) he forms his own tiny firm with a sex-seeking endearing imbecile (Dave Franco) and a sex-seeking retirement-aged Brit (Tom Wilkinson).

Once the poster child for bros-behaving-badly fare Vaughn has recently begun engaging in an interesting occasionally perplexing bait-and-switch Lure us with the promise of wild antics (the posters forA Unfinished BusinessA depict Vaughn and co-stars Tom Wilkinson and Dave Franco in various states of bacchanalia) then deliver something more somber and sensitive instead. Looking back over my review ofA Delivery Man the 2013 sperm-donor comedy-drama Vaughn made with hisA Unfinished BusinessA director Ken Scott I see that I basically said the same thing then too. So maybe I should stop being so perplexed. But still. For its first half Unfinished Business is surprisingly acerbic and serious more Up in the Air than Office Space. It opens mid-conversation as we see St. Louis mineral salesman Dan Trunkman (Vaughn) bickering with his ruthless boss Chuck (Sienna Miller -- yes you read that right) over a 5 percent pay cut. The next thing he knows Dan has quit to form his own rival company and asked his co-workers to join him a la Jerry Maguire. But the only two people who accompany him to the parking lot are Timothy (Wilkinson) a veteran employee whos been separately let go for being too old and Mike (Franco) a young man who was only there for an interview. They all need the work however Dan has a son being bullied for his weight and a daughter unhappy at school and his wife wants to send them to private school; Timothy really really wants to divorce his wife but he also wants to leave her a comfortable amount of money and go off on his own and live a little; Mike it turns out is a young man with special needs and could really use the confidence boost. Dans new company flounders of course One year later its still the same three guys and their office is a Dunkin Donuts. But then they find out that they may have scored a big deal with a major client and they fly to Portland then to Berlin to make ""the handshake"" as it were. Things dont turn out as planned Their trip to Berlin coincides with a G8 meeting (and concomitant protest) a marathon and Europes largest gay fetish convention. Oh and it turns out their supposedly done business deal is a bit shakier than promised. Does any of this actually sound funny to you? It sounds potentially offensive more than anything else like the kinds of jokes Vaughn and his cohort might have gotten away with 15 years ago. But amazingly Unfinished Business has a gentle touch Yes they do run into the gay fetish scene but it results in one of the more good-natured (and explicit) glory hole setpieces youll see in a mainstream comedy. The tonally weird bits involving Mikes dim antics are played somewhat for laughs but theyre light ones; the film is clearly on the sheltered young mans side more interested in letting him explore than poking fun at him. Meanwhile Timothy gets both the requisite horndog moments as well as some genuine pathos. At times the film seems to be hinting at a darker theme of masculine identity Our protagonists once saw themselves as the male breadwinners of yore; that world is changing so their business trip has a weirdly elegiac feel. They dont quite know how to operate in this new scene but theyre learning. Alas the movie doesnt really do much with this subtext maybe because it doesnt quite have the depth or dexterity to do such a loaded subject justice. Not unlike Delivery Man Unfinished Business is a movie at war with itself It wants to be serious -- and it is -- but it wants to try to deliver the comedic goods as well. Sometimes the tonal dissonance works. At one point Dan checks into what appears to be the last hotel room in Berlin; it turns out that its not technically a hotel room at all but a piece of art -- an exhibition of an American businessman in a hotel room and hes paying for the privilege of being gawked at by tourists. But the laughs here are dry not uproarious and theyre just unsettling enough to work. Theres plenty to like in Unfinished Business even though viewers expecting the debauchery of a Wedding Crashers will likely leave disappointed. I feel for Vince Vaughn I really do. He clearly wants to explore this more serious vein but he keeps having to sell his former high-concept persona. Its a fascinating existential dilemma for a movie star to find himself in; if only it resulted in better movies.A Tagsvince vaughndave francotom wilkinsonmoviesunfinished businessMore Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories Behind the Batman The Killing Joke Movieas Approach to Batgirl Sex and Sexual Violence Gucci Mane Is Better Than Heas Been in Years on Everybody Looking Why We Need a Big Gay TV Show Most Viewed Stories Constance Wu Slams Matt Damonas Great Wall Film for Perpetuating a aRacist Mytha 44.8k Shares Share Tweet LeBron James Reportedly Stopped Justin Bieber From Performing at the RNC 94 Shares Share Tweet John C.

Watch in Times Video >> embed A ""EuroTrip"" with balance sheets the slick innocuous comedy ""Unfinished Business"" fails to seal the deal. Dan Trunkman (Vince Vaughn) is a St. Louis executive and father whose company is being restructured by Chuck Portnoy (Sienna Miller) a shark already demanding too many hours from employees. Enraged Dan starts a rival outfit hiring Tim McWinters (Tom Wilkinson) an older colleague forced into retirement and Mike Pancake (Dave Franco) a young pretty dullard. Photo From left Dave Franco Tom Wilkinson and Vince Vaughn. Credit Jessica Miglio/20th Century Fox Competing with the scheming Chuck for a big contract the three head to Portland Me.; to Hamburg Germany; and to Berlin which teems with a G-8 meeting and protest; to a running event; and to Oktoberfest. Dan ends up behind glass in a museum installation on exhibition as the essential American businessman. Tim consumes pills and pot while Mike loses his virginity (""twice""). They also down gallons of beer and cultivate a British contact (Nick Frost) at a gay bar.There are gawking observations about German permissiveness and undercooked subplots about Dans children (the daughter gets in a fight; the son is overweight and alienated) but mostly this is diverting wish fulfillment for traveling businessmen with plugs for Orbitz and National car rentals. If only its depiction of corporate women (bad) and stay-at-home moms (good) wasnt so rankling and retrograde. Dont expect impressive profit margins.""Unfinished Business"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Bong hits penis jokes and cost analysis.

"Unfinished Business an odd mix of laughs poignancy review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesUnfinished Business an odd mix of laughs poignancy reviewQuebecois director Ken Scott combines broad comedy with sweet family drama in Unfinished Business.Dave Franco Tom Wilkinson and Vince Vaughn play a trio of underdog business types who travel to Berlin to compete for a crucial contract in the comedy Unfinished Business.By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. March 5 2015Unfinished BusinessStarring Vince Vaughn Tom Wilkinson Dave Franco. Directed by Ken Scott. At GTA theatres. 85 minutes. 14A.Our American neighbours generally view Europeans as more liberal and open-minded when it comes to their after-work pursuits. Unfinished Business an odd mix of whacky and sentimental will only serve to reinforce the stereotype.Article Continued BelowDirected by Ken Scott (Starbuck) the latest Quebecois filmmaker to go Hollywood its a film thats a bit of a headscratcher in that its mood and tone vary so wildly.Watch the trailer on television and youll imagine its purely a party-hearty comedy. But theres such a powerful streak of melancholic tension throughout the film often seems more like dramedy.The story opens with Dan Trunkman (Vince Vaughn) walking out as his job at a large film in a huff with two colleagues in tow Timothy (Tom Wilkinson) whos just been cashiered because hes past retirement age and the waifish Mike Pancake (Dave Franco) whose last name is milked for comic relief throughout.A year later the small company Dan has created is down and out and hes desperate to land a big contract. But Dans old nemesis the improbably named Chuck Portnoy (Sienna Miller) is competing for the same contract and conniving with smarmy and duplicitous colleague Jim Spinch (James Marsden).Dan is forced to fly to Berlin to land the confirmatory handshake but is his little-company-that-could merely the ""fluffer"" used to create the impression that theres a real competition for the big deal?Back at home Dan has a wonderfully supportive wife but hes also got an overweight teenage son who needs to go to an expensive private school where he wont get picked on quite as much (good luck with that) and a daughter who may have bullying issues.Dans relationship with his kids is an important subplot to the story and Vaughan is pleasingly sensitive in his portrayal of a man torn between a demanding job and a family he genuinely loves.The arrival of Dan and company in Berlin come at a particularly busy time for the German capital what with Oktoberfest a G-8 summit meeting the Berlin Marathon and a gay leather/fetish event called Folsom Europe. All four events figure prominently in the ensuing action.The script by Steve Conrad (The Secret Life of Walter Mitty) has all kinds of zany things going on including a daring scene at the gay fetish event a reindeer that causes a car crash and Dan donning eye shadow to relate to his son as well as plenty of beer-guzzling and drug-taking.While Vaughan capably shoulders much of the load as world-weary Dan the supporting cast is a bit of mixed bag. The very fine British actor Wilkinson isnt terribly believable or funny as Timothy in large part due to a script that makes him seem almost senile.Dave Franco with the same broad gummy smile as older actor brother James Franco makes Mike a likable character and gets many of the scripts best lines. But the characters naivete and inability to pronounce big words makes one wonder if hes supposed to be developmentally delayed (and why thats supposed to be funny).Still theres enough big laughs combined with sweet family drama to make Unfinished Business an eventful journey.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Unfinished Business is indeed unfinished - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Unfinished Business is indeed unfinished Unfinished Business Jessica Miglio / 20th Century Fox Vince Vaughn left Tom Wilkinson and Dave Franco in ""Unfinished Business."" Vince Vaughn left Tom Wilkinson and Dave Franco in ""Unfinished Business."" (Jessica Miglio / 20th Century Fox) Gary Goldstein Vince Vaughn is a rare bright spot in the laugh-free comedy Unfinished Business The piece of business thats most unfinished in the desperate comedy ""Unfinished Business"" is the wan hodgepodge of a script by Steve Conrad a talented screenwriter (""The Promotion"" ""The Pursuit of Happyness"") who shouldve known better. Its remarkable to think star Vince Vaughn helmer Ken Scott (who directed Vaughn in 2013s ""Delivery Man"") or any other decision makers actually read the script and said ""This is great -- lets go""Theres a workable premise here A trio of St. Louis salesmen -- new small-business owner Dan (Vaughn) and hapless colleagues Tim (Tom Wilkinson) and Mike (Dave Franco) -- must travel to Berlin by way of Portland Maine. for a make-or-break meeting but disaster befalls them at every turn. Think the first ""Out-of-Towners"" but with three guys instead of a married couple. If only. The result is a sluggishly paced collection of go-nowhere sight gags flat-footed set pieces and incoherent business chatter that offers few laughs and little real payoff. Then again if the idea of work meetings conducted in a unisex sauna at a gay fetish party or while cops subdue unruly G8-summit protesters sounds like a gas have at it. Dans hotel room thats actually a peek-a-boo art installation is one of the films dumbest conceits.Vaughn is the one bright spot here. Hes warm equitable and resilient -- almost Tom Hanks-like -- as a man trying to bring home the bacon for his loving family. However the film goes to such great lengths to portray him as Dad of the Year its overkill. The great Wilkinson slums it as a randy senior not ready to call it quits. Mostly though the role is an excuse for him to drop the F-bomb and pop Ecstasy. As for Franco who plays a slow-witted virgin a little goes a long way.

Jessica Miglio/Twentieth Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Jessica Miglio/Twentieth Century Fox In the midst of a European business trip Dan Truckman (Vince Vaughn) Timothy McWinters (Tom Wilkinson) and Mike Pancake (David Franco) somehow end up in a pasture. Jessica Miglio/Twentieth Century Fox Its unclear what commerce is left undone in Unfinished Business a fumbling mix of sentimental family fable and gross-out sex comedy. Maybe the movie was originally titled Unfunny Business but someone decided that would be bad for well business. The would-be hilarity begins with a Jerry Maguire moment Dan (Vince Vaughn) quits his industrial salesman job in a pay dispute and asks others to join him in starting a new firm. Instead of perky Renee Zellwegger he gets tired Tim (Tom Wilkinson) who was just fired for being too old and clueless Mike (Dave Franco) who was in the building to apply for a job he didnt get. The slow-witted Mike is so mentally challenged that he went to ""special school"" and lives in a group home. This is one of several plot points that scripter Steve Conrad (The Pursuit of Happyness) fails to make either tasteful or humorous. A year later the trio heads from Missouri to Maine to sign the deal that will make theirs a viable company. (They deal in the metal manufacturing residue called ""swarf"" a substance probably chosen for comic potential that remains dormant.) It turns out that the negotiations are not complete. So the guys hop a plane to Berlin land of unisex steam baths gay discos designed for anonymous sex and -- scariest of all -- conceptual art. The G8 Summit is in town so protesters and cops clash in the streets. Oktoberfest and a big marathon are also scheduled which means the hotels are full. Tim and Mike end up at a youth hostel while Dan beds down in a museum display labeled ""American Businessman."" Before they can make their pitch the guys must connect with various potential allies. None of them of course is at the office. Theyre in the steamroom or the toilet of a club out of Taxi Zum Klo the once-notorious 1980 cinematic tour of Berlins gay subculture. Meanwhile back at home Dans kids are struggling. His wife (June Diane Raphael) insists that Dan come up with cash he doesnt have to send their bullied son to private school. All of this is weirdly earnest in a movie that depends heavily on cringe-till-you-giggle moments that involve breasts penises and baroque sexual positions. Plus of course binge drinking bong hits and watching the old guy dance goofily after he takes Ecstasy. Amid all the bids for the frat-boy audience Unfinished Business endeavors to be warm and wise. In a moment that the filmmakers must have thought would be touching Dan dons eye shadow to video-chat with his son about the kids attempt to become a goth. That would seem to indicate that Dan is secure in his masculinity but the movie sure isnt. The threesomes female competitor (Sienna Miller) is so unfemininely ruthless in the filmmakers eyes that shes named Chuck. And the disco bathroom scene offers a musty mixture of disgust and awe at gay male sexuality. Director Ken Scott previously worked with Vaughn on Delivery Man another daddy parable. So its hardly surprising when the movies final words come from Dans young daughter -- or that they flatter her father. Dan may not be a great businessman or father but in vanity vehicles like this the star always knows best.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Michael OSullivan March 5 2015 For about 15 years now scientists in the laboratories of Hollywood have been trying to replicate the success of such films as ""Theres Something About Mary"" and ""American Pie"" -- two movies that at the twilight of the 20th century managed to achieve the delicate alchemy of turning base humor into box office gold. Both of those movies found the sweet spot -- or rather the salty-sweet no mans land between tender emotion and penis jokes -- that few filmmakers with the notable exception of Judd Apatow and a handful of others have been able to consistently hit. (Case in point ""Road Hard"" reviewed on Page 28 of Weekend.) Thats why ""Unfinished Business"" is such a pleasant surprise. While by no means a masterpiece the comedy by Canadian director Ken Scott is a careful calibration of crass gags and genuine sentiment that succeeds more often than it fails. Its hard to imagine a movie that combines a scene set in a gay sex club (featuring numerous shots of male genitalia) with a subplot about parenting but ""Unfinished Business"" is that thing. Somehow it works. The film centers on Dan Trunkman (Vince Vaughn) a businessman struggling to get his small start-up off the ground. Specializing in the sale of metal shavings called swarf -- just the word itself is funny -- Dans company employs a morose 67-year-old named Tim McWinters (Tom Wilkinson) and a borderline developmentally disabled kid named Mike Pancake (Dave Franco who is far funnier here than his brother James was in ""The Interview."") As with ""swarf"" many of the jokes have to do with Mikes weird last name. When the opportunity to close a big deal presents itself these three misfits set out on a business trip that takes them to Berlin where they encounter Dans former boss (Sienna Miller) who is competing for the same contract. High jinks as they say ensue. Along with the aforementioned sex club scene there is a protracted business meeting in a coed sauna a bit of sex and drugs and a running gag about the fact that the only hotel room that Dan can find in Berlin is a glass-walled ""American Businessman"" installation in a contemporary art museum. Miraculously these dumb things are all more amusing than they deserve to be. Most of the credit goes to Scott who pulled off a similar trick in ""Starbuck"" a surprisingly charming 2011 French-language comedy about a man who discovers that due to a mix-up at the sperm bank where he was once a donor he is the father of 142 grown children. Scott attempted a repeat with the English remake ""Delivery Man"" (also starring Vaughn) but with mixed success. Hes a smart filmmaker though and he knows how to mine genuine sweetness even out of the most vulgar material. Steve Conrad (""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"") is the screenwriter. And lets not forget the cast. Vaughn heads up a strong ensemble that also features Nick Frost and James Marsden as employees of the company with which Dan is trying to do business. Britton Sear and Ella Anderson also shine as Dans young children both of whom are dealing with school bullying while Daddy is away on business. This substantial -- and unexpectedly touching -- subplot conducted mostly on video chat revolves around Dans long-distance parenting. Superficially it has nothing to do with the rest of the story but it helps to humanize and round out Vaughns character in ways that pay off and make us care about him. Although ""Unfinished Business"" swerves and wobbles at times Scott has an assured hand on the wheel. This hybrid vehicle may take an unwise detour here and there -- even hitting a mud-filled pothole or two -- but in the end you just might find that its been an entertaining ride. Unfinished Business   1/2 (91 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for a lot of nudity and sexual humor drug use and obscenity. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

(Jessica Miglio/fox) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday March 5 2015 134 PM Title ""Unfinished Business"" Film Info Three businessmen go for broke during a trip to Germany. (130) R Nudity language sexuality. Area theaters. Unbelievable. ""Unfinished Business"" squanders almost every opportunity provided by its potentially funny premise. Instead it becomes yet another blotch on star Vince Vaughns resume. True ""Business"" earns its few chuckles from Vaughns world-weary way with a throwaway line. And theres no way to mess up watching people run down the street trapped inside a giant rolling plastic ball. But the rest of the movie makes you feel like youre the one gasping for air. Vaughn is Dan Trunkman a St. Louis salesman who tells off his jerky boss (Sienna Miller) before dramatically quitting and walking out of his office grandly inviting his co-workers ""Jerry Maguire""-style to join him in an exciting new venture. No one does but in the parking lot Dan meets a just-fired old guy Timothy (Tom Wilkinson) and Mike (Dave Franco) a doltish kid whos just had a job interview. Together they form Dans new company. One year later to secure a major new deal with an industrial hotshot (James Marsden) Dan Timothy and Mike fly to Berlin. There they get caught up -- non-hilariously -- in bad hotel accommodations an anti-G8 protest a gay fetish festival and a traffic snarl on the Autobahn. ""Business"" -- directed by Ken Scott who made ""The Delivery Man"" another underpowered Vaughn vehicle -- fumbles every setup joke and potential payoff. Dan winds up in an ""art installation hotel"" which turns his stay into a performance-art piece for people to gawk at through windows. Timothy hungry for a divorce goes on a search for sex and excitement. But even when he takes drugs all we get is a slow-motion scene of his joyful dancing. Worst of of all is Francos Mike a character meant to be annoying -- the one thing the movie succeeds at. But Mike also turns out to be a mentally slow young man living in a group home. With that Scott makes our laughing at the character inappropriate even as Franco ratchets up the irritating dopiness. Dave Franco Tom Wilkinson Vince Vaughn in ""Unfinished Business."" (Jessica Miglio/fox) Unlike the similar and superior ""Cedar Rapids"" this movie is filled with unreal people and has no grounding in reality so the wild antics seem desperate. Vaughns response is to become nearly immobile turning the angry comic energy he had in ""Swingers"" ""Wedding Crashers"" and ""The Break-Up"" into lethargy. Its as if he knows hes capable of more but cant rouse himself to participate in such a lame movie. This workplace comedy wants your money but doesnt give you anything for it.

Photo Jessica Miglio MOVIE REVIEW Unfinished Business Running time 90 minutes. Rated R (profanity nudity crude humor sex drug abuse). That ""Unfinished Business"" thinks its a really fun idea to have a leading character named Mike Pancake tells you all you need to know. So someone asks Mike in a meeting your boss name is what Steve Toast? Ho ho. Stop my ribs are cracking. Vince Vaughn who thinks the reason ""The Internship"" failed was because it was PG-13 takes another crack at corporation comedy with this extremely R-rated effort in which he plays a salesman of metal filings who quits his job rather than take a 5 percent pay cut. A year later having taken a 100 percent pay cut while running a failing rival firm that doesnt even have an office he finally has a chance to show his now-ex-boss (Sienna Miller) hes a player by closing his first big deal in Germany. In tow are two guys he met at the old company a 67-year-old horndog (Tom Wilkinson) and a mentally challenged youngster (Dave Franco) whos so thick he doesnt know the difference between a square and a rectangle. Mostly ""Unfinished Business"" is a tale of unfinished jokes Hey what if Timothy McWinters (Wilkinson) kept talking dirty getting high on Ectasy and smoking weed? All of those ideas could lead somewhere. None does. He hires a ""sex maid"" to come to his hotel room but then the hooker-cleaner goes to the Vaughn characters room to clean it instead. Hes happily married and wasnt expecting that. Ha ha. Photo Jessica MiglioAlso theres a long long setup for a business meeting that gets conducted in the nude in a sauna. The payoff? Nothing much except Francos character mutters ""boobs"" and ""butt crack."" Director Ken Scott who guided Vaughn in last years flop ""Delivery Man"" has the kind of comic timing youd expect from a corporate compliance officers PowerPoint presentation on updates to Section 1.6045-5 (b) (1) regulations. And Vaughn cant save his doomed project by being ""Vince Vaughn"" the motormouthed charmer who is automatically funny if this is still 2005. Theres one potentially genius scene the only memorable one in the movie during which the boys find themselves in the mens room of a gay dance club where three friendly patrons chat merrily while all we see of each gentleman is the bit that happens to be sticking out of a hole in the door of his stall. The dimwit Mike Pancake attempts to shake er hands with them. Credit must be given for novelty as well as for the absence of gay panic shown by Vaughn but the scene doesnt live up to its potential. Like every other idea in the movie it just peters out.

Comments click to enlarge Unfinished Business Video Rated R  91 minutes  2015 In this farcical road comedy a struggling small-business owner (Vince Vaughn) goes to Germany to close a deal with a potential client bringing along two hapless employees (Dave Franco Tom Wilkinson) who are more interested in pleasure than in business. The role is a departure of sorts for Vaughn his character more responsible than the goofballs he normally plays but his frat-boy shtick has grown the worse for wear since the days of Dodgeball A True Underdog Story (2004) and Wedding Crashers (2005). Wilkinson known for playing strong malevolent types is occasionally surprising in his role as an unhappily married guy desperate to cut loose but the veteran character actor seems lost amid the directionless plot and unimaginative improv.

VPCDave Franco left Tom Wilkinson and Vince Vaughn travel to Germany to try to save their struggling business.(Photo Jessica Miglio 20th Century Fox)About halfway into the comedy Unfinished Business -- when Vince Vaughn finds himself in a bar bathroom with an ahem German sausage party going on during a gay fetish festival -- one has to wonder if he wishes his usual partner Owen Wilson was around.Instead Vaughn is teamed with Dave Franco and Tom Wilkinson for a bland road-trip film that falls flat while heaping on the raunchiness. There is actually a heartwarming drama about a father and his kids at its heart but Unfinished Business ( out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide) spends too much time on egregiously unfunny jokes involving sexual positions and Fifty Shades of Grey.A year after mineral salesman Dan Trunkman (Vaughn) pulls a Jerry Maguire and leaves a company to start his own -- with aging Timothy McWinters (Wilkinson) and ridiculously green Mike Pancake (Franco) in tow -- theyre struggling. Not only is the business not doing well but Dans time spent traveling is not helping his two troubled children.Dans faced with a ""Whos your daddy?"" homework assignment for his daughter and cant quite get around to filling it out and the hard-working businessman needs to land a really big deal so he can send his bullied son to a private school.Director Ken Scott (Delivery Man) and screenwriter Steve Conrad (The Secret Life of Walter Mitty) have a relatable flick in those spots. But instead the story veers off wildly Hangover-style when the guys jet off to Germany for a business trip that keeps going wrong be it crashing a car while trying not to hit a ""reindeer"" trying to wheel and deal while naked in a bathhouse and running into their old boss (Sienna Miller).Wilkinsons character is all over the place -- wanting a prostitute one minute and fearing for his longterm job prospects the next -- and is more sad than whimsical. Threes actually a crowd A two-handed comedy with Vaughn and Franco would have worked considerably better.Francos somewhat slow and mumbling virgin who is just this side of offensive is one of the movies bright spots. And Vaughns everyman affability from Old School and Wedding Crashers serves him well in his role as a struggling dad.Vaughn and Nick Frost also have a nice couple of moments as a couple of working-class dudes just trying to make it in the world though unfortunately at the time Frost is wearing a too-tight leather outfit and looks like the husky lost member of the Village People.Its just one of many examples that this film is just bad Business for everyone involved. 7 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1BLAl2f",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/03/05/unfinished-business-movie-review/24422205/,200,unfinishedbusiness16,unfinishedbusiness,usatoday

When work associates Mike (Dave Franco left) Tim (Tom Wilkinson) and Dan (Vince Vaughn) attempt to seal a crucial deal things start to go awry in ""Unfinished Business."" Photo Jessica Miglio / Jessica Miglio / 20th Century Fox Unfinished Business Comedy with a depressing theme 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The world keeps intruding on ""Unfinished Business"" the actual world that the filmmakers are too honest to deny. A supposedly rollicking comedy about a sink-or-swim business trip the movie cant keep out a depressing awareness of modern-day corporate culture and what it does to people. In theory of course its possible to make a comedy about anything -- Charlie Chaplin after all made a comedy about Hitler (""The Great Dictator""). But Chaplin did it by making fun of Hitler by making the monster funny (though still a monster). ""Unfinished Business"" is set against a background in which business is genuinely soul-killing not funny at all. Yet were expected to forget about that selectively and laugh at the diverting antics going on in the foreground -- the usual spectacle of idiots abroad getting stoned having sex and getting into trouble. We do laugh but we never forget. Thats the weirdness of ""Unfinished Business"" as an experience. Theres something wrong with it or wrong with the world or maybe both but theres definitely something wrong. The bad feeling starts in the first scene in which Vince Vaughn as a top salesman for a company selling metal shavings (or something like that) finds out that his pay is getting cut 5 percent take it or leave it. After arguing with his smug and implacable boss (Sienna Miller) he decides to quit and venture into business as his former boss competitor. On the way to his car he hires Tim (Tom Wilkinson) who has been let go for hitting the mandatory retirement age and Mike (Dave Franco) a mentally challenged young man who is in the movie for comic relief. As Dan a good guy just trying to do business Vaughn is his usual fast-talking smart-mouthed self but here that radiant confidence is at risk from the beginning -- first from a pod-people business environment and later from power players who inflict pain and sow anxiety for the fun of it. When he goes to Portland to finalize a pre-negotiated business deal he finds the deal up for grabs and has to chase it all the way to Berlin. The movie creates a real atmosphere of anxiety around the business deal which is an achievement. Yet at times its a counterproductive achievement when were then expected to relax and release into the comedy -- as when Vaughn accidentally finds himself in the midst of a business deal while wearing womens running clothes. Theres no standing on the outside and laughing at it. No were in it right there with him feeling the embarrassment. Still grounding the movie in real stakes pays off when the scenes turn serious. Theres a very good one in which Vaughn follows a high-powered German vendor into a steam room and she wont even discuss business until the ""Puritan"" American takes off his clothes. Another scene in which our hero finally gets to pitch directly to the top man has an air of authenticity largely thanks to the calm assurance of Uwe Ochsenknecht. But what are we to say about a comedy that makes you walk out feeling lousy thats like a parade of beaten virtue and (mostly) sadistic power? Maybe this is the comedy that business deserves. Maybe its good to feel lousy even if that wasnt the movies intention. Or maybe this is just a slightly better than mediocre film with a disconcerting grasp of the truth. Id say the latter but would talk no one out of seeing ""Unfinished Business"" just so long as you know what youre getting into. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicle movie critic.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The domestication of Vince Vaughn continues unabated in Unfinished Business. Over the past 10 years Vaughn appears to have taken the heartfelt settling-down resolution of Wedding Crashers as a career directive as hes made his way through adult rites of passage like painful breakups (The Break-Up) relationship maintenance (Couples Retreat) the adult navigation of broken families (Four Christmases) accepting parenthood (Delivery Man) a midlife career change (The Internship) and now a smattering of leftover issues including working as your own boss providing for your family and dealing with teen bullying. Vaughn poses as a regular guy with a little more grace than Adam Sandler (maybe because Sandler has long since abandoned the middle class for mansions and extended vacations) but the mechanism is the same A once-energetic comic talent (and underrated serious actor) slows down to a pace he must feel matches his audience these days.Vaughn puts one foot back into raunchy comedy with Unfinished Business but the movies forays into R-rated territory feel both cautious and perfunctory--maybe because his character Dan Trunkman is a caring family man and boss too fatherly and goodhearted to indulge much of Vaughns trademark motormouthed riffing. (He gets one sorta-funny monologue in a European sauna.) Instead little moments of barely comic sourness slip through as he realizes that the three-man mineral sales firm hes started with old guy Timothy (Tom Wilkinson) and inexperienced young guy Mike (Dave Franco) might not have the goods to compete with his cutthroat former boss Chuck (Sienna Miller) for the business of a particularly important client. Vaughns team winds up in Berlin scrambling for face time with company men played by Nick Frost and James Marsden.Forming rollicking bonds with Wilkinson and Franco ought to come easily to Vaughn; forced camaraderie is built into his shtick. But the three capable actors struggle to create the impression that theyve known each other for more than a few weeks even though the big business trip takes place after theyve spent a year as their companys only employees. Wilkinsons Timothy comes off more morose than funny and while Franco gets some laughs as the Brick Tamland-ish naif of the group the conditions of his sweet stupidity are even more mush-mouthed than his delivery--the movie wants to spring his lack of business qualifications as a comic surprise without risking any meanness. That low-risk low-reward strategy will be familiar to anyone who saw Delivery Man the previous collaboration between Vaughn and director Ken Scott. While Unfinished Business has way more swearing and nudity piled on as would-be spice its squishy undercooked texture remains the same. This would matter less if the filmmakers delivered a few memorable comic set pieces. But the comedy-heart balance doesnt match the best work of credited screenwriter Steve Conrad who has penned midlife crises both sharply funny (The Weather Man The Promotion) and Hollywood maudlin (The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty) possibly because Scotts direction has no snap. Throughout the movie he rushes through setups and jumps into gags too quickly; when Dan makes a wrong turn into traffic on a one-way street the camera starts drifting away before the already-weak punchline lands. Even when the movie heads into its obligatory montage of debauchery in which the comedy depends on visual surprises with as little setup as possible Scott can only manage one or two funny cuts out of a few dozen. When the movie takes time to actually run (not just repeat) a gag it sometimes pays off most notably in an amusingly strange bit about Vaughn staying in a hotel room thats actually a German art installation. Mostly though Unfinished Business is notable for what it doesnt do It doesnt give Dans business a dream-job sheen; it doesnt portray Dans wife as a humorless nag; it doesnt score too many points against ruthless businesswoman Miller. It also doesnt give Miller or Marsden characters to play and it treats Dans kids as emotional checkpoints. Like several of Vaughns most recent comedies this one concerns itself with keeping its heart in the ""right"" place--i.e. a safe distance from the unsavory business of laughter.

Director Ken Scott cant establish a tone for the film.Mike (Dave Franco) Tim (Tom Wilkinson) and Dan (Vince Vaughn) run afoul of police at a G8-summit protest in ""Unfinished Business.""(Photo 20th Century Fox)Story Highlights2 stars (out of 5)Scott cant establish a tone for the film. Is it a sex comedy or a heartfelt family story?Either story might have worked but as it stands the film is a jumbled mess.Another Vince Vaughn movie another misfire.So it goes with ""Unfinished Business"" a sort of unfinished idea that could have been interesting could have been funny could have been something other than the jumbled mess that it is. Vaughn Tom Wilkinson and Dave Franco play businessmen who travel to Europe to close a deal; things of course go awry.""I saw that part but it was boring"" a man says to Vaughns character who spends a couple of nights in a Berlin museum as part of an art installation (dont worry thats hardly the dumbest bit).The man hits it squarely on the head. For a movie that incorporates high-stakes business competition a protest at a G8 economic summit and an international gay-fetish convention its pretty dull stuff.There also are the earnest heartfelt family scenes. If that seems a poor fit in the middle of a review its a poor fit in the movie too. Its not bad mind you -- its the most genuine part of the movie. But it just sort of pops up every now and then when director Ken Scott and screenwriter Steve Conrad get tired of Wilkinson explaining to Franco over and over again a particularly adventurous sexual position.The film begins with Dan Trunkman (Vaughn) arguing with his boss Chuck (Sienna Miller) in front of the whole office over a proposed 5-percent pay cut. Dan quits on the spot and invites anyone interested in a fresh start to come with him.Timothy McWinters (Wilkinson) does after he gets fired because of his age (67). Mike Pancake (Franco) who never actually worked for the company but has a box of belongings that he thought would show confidence in an interview joins Dan too.They start their own company a competitor in the evidently cutthroat field of metal-shavings sales. After a tough year theyre finally about to close a major deal with nothing left but the ""handshake"" -- a term used so often it grows tiresome then irritating.A quick trip from their home in St. Louis to Portland Maine to meet with the smarmy Jim Spinch (James Marsden) to seal the deal goes off-track when Chuck shows up and announces that shes in the mix. For some reason they all have to go to Berlin to meet with the owner of Spinchs company and Dans teams meeting gets delayed for a day.Whats the saying? Idle hands are the devils workshop? The screenwriters too. Dan gives the crowd at the museum watching him brush his teeth a speech about not wasting your off days but the extra day really exists just to give the characters wild and crazy adventures in a foreign land.Every now and then Dan makes a Skype call home to deal with his son Paul (Britton Sear) who is being teased because hes overweight or his daughter Bess (Ella Anderson) who has anger issues. Dans wife (June Diane Raphael) thinks private school would solve the problems so its imperative that Dan close the deal.Timothy wants the money to get a divorce with the hope of happiness on the other side of it. (This movie has some weird ideas about happiness.) Mike just wants to belong and figure out that challenging sexual position.Maybe if it had stuck with the sex-comedy theme the film would have been better. Maybe if it had been the examination of the effects of an overworked spouse on family life that would have worked too. Scotts clumsy direction doesnt help matters. He holds shots too long diluting visual punch lines and is generally tone deaf when it comes to payoffs.As it stands ""Unfinished Business"" is a jumble of half-baked ideas none particularly interesting.Unfinished Business2 stars (out of 5) Director Ken Scott.Cast Vince Vaughn Tom Wilkinson Dave Franco.Rating R for some strong risque sexual content/graphic nudity and for language and drug use.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Over the course of a movie we can learn a little bit about being a secret agent a brain surgeon or a drummer -- and the best scripts provide the right amount of information about that profession to impact the storytelling. We might walk into ""Casino"" with no understanding of the gambling business or ""Locke"" not knowing anything about a concrete pour but over the course of those films we learn enough of the mechanics to make the plot more suspenseful and enthralling and to care about the characters and the stakes of their success or failure. See Video Vince Vaughn Dave Franco Take Raunchy Unfinished Business to Europe in Red Band Trailer (Video) Sadly no one behind ""Unfinished Business"" decided that audiences would get even a cursory explanation about the business part Three salesmen form their own company and spend most of the film trying to close a deal that has something to do with swarf a metal residue left over in the creation of large steel objects. Are they buying it? Selling it? The movie cant be bothered to tell us. Not that this comedy needed to be a documentary about its subject but the fact that it cant spell out the basics of this business deal -- outside of some ""robble robble projected income graph percentage closing"" jargon that gets peppered throughout the screenplay by Steve Conrad (""The Pursuit of Happyness"" ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"") -- is indicative of a general lack of focus and an inconsistency in tone. The film opens with Dan (Vince Vaughn) quitting his job over a five percent pay cut and loudly announcing that anyone who wants to join him in his new venture should meet him in the parking lot. The only ones who take him up on the offer are Tim (Tom Wilkinson) whos being forced to retire and Mike (Dave Franco) who didnt actually work there but showed up for a job interview with a box of office supplies to prove his enthusiasm. A year later Dan and his team are flying off to Portland Maine to perform the all-important handshake to close their companys first deal but upon arrival Dan bumps into his old boss Chuck (Sienna Miller) who is out to trump her former employee. The battle to preserve the pact forces Dan Tim and Mike to fly to Germany to meet with the buyers (sellers?) big boss and wackiness of a sort ensues. On the one hand ""Unfinished Business"" wants to be a hard-R comedy with sojourns to a co-ed sauna (an uncomfortable sniggery scene) and the backroom of a Berlin gay leather bar (which admittedly pushes visible-penis-related humor pretty far for a mainstream Hollywood movie) in addition to a riot outside the G-8 Summit. At the same time however the film keeps attempting to tug at our heartstrings with Dans FaceTime attempts to be a good husband (a terribly underused June Diane Raphael plays the wife) and dad. Part of what drives Dan to close this deal is his desire to afford private school for his kids which ""Unfinished Business"" unquestioningly presents as a solution for bullying. See Video Vince Vaughn Lady Gaga and Taylor Kinney Plunge Into Frozen Water for Special Olympics (Video) The film cant quite make up its mind about Francos Holy Fool character either; were meant to laugh at his naivete and his malapropisms at one moment then we find out hes a resident in a group home so we can admire his can-do attitude and later its revealed that he has made valuable and intelligent contributions to the sales report even though he never indicates in conversation that he understands anything about the deal. These are pieces that might fit together in a smarter stronger movie but director Ken Scott (reteaming with Vaughn after the dreary ""Delivery Man"") seems to mold the characters scene by scene rather than making them believable and consistent over the course of the story. (And the less said on the dopey subplot about Tims unhappy marriage and his desire to have sex in new and interesting positions the better except that it leads to some of the films clumsiest most leaden gags.) Also Read True Detective Casting of Colin Farrell Vince Vaughn Draws Early Grumbling From Fans Vaughn blusters in his usual manner combining the swimming-up-career-stream desperation of his ""The Internship"" character with the brash-but-loving family guy of ""Delivery Man"" but the remove he brings to every performance -- as though he were putting everything in quotes -- becomes more disconcerting the further away he moves from the young slackers he used to play. Still ""Unfinished Business"" isnt a laugh-free experience -- Nick Frost steals every scene as a business underling with a kinky side -- and some of the comic set pieces actually work. Its certainly the best thing Vaughn has done in the decade since ""Wedding Crashers"" which makes it less of a raw deal than usual. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Daily Edition Login to download Unfinished Business Film Review 600 AM PST 3/4/2015 by Jon Frosch FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS Take your business elsewhere TWITTER Vince Vaughn and Dave Franco headline Hollywoods latest raucous male-bonding romp. In the years since he strutted onto the scene -- lean handsome mouth running a mile a minute -- in Doug Limans Swingers (1996) Vince Vaughn has become one of the poster boys for the mainstream American comedy from romantic (The Break-Up) to bromantic (Old School) pretty good (Wedding Crashers) to very bad (Fred Claus) to frankly unnecessary (Delivery Man). His new film Unfinished Business falls into that last subcategory -- perhaps not coincidentally as it too was directed by Ken Scott (Delivery Man was Scotts remake of his own homegrown Quebecois hit Starbuck). A guys-gone-wild romp in the well-worn tradition of Todd Phillips Hangover franchise this is the latest example of a movie that doesnt work hard enough to freshen up formulas used and abused by filmmakers like Phillips Judd Apatow Nicholas Stoller (Neighbors) Seth Gordon (Horrible Bosses) and others. Indeed Unfinished Business will seem woefully familiar to most anyone whos been to a movie theater -- or taken a long plane ride -- over the past 10 years. Male sexual panic gags involving penises? Check. Drug-fueled bacchanals shown in slow-mo? Check. Car high jinks (here involving a German-language GPS)? Check. Disposable misogynistically conceived female characters? Check. Lessons learned (dont be a bully; never give up; appreciate what you have)? Check. And check please. Read more Vince Vaughn Unfinished Business Co-Stars Pose for Ridiculous Stock Photos Vaughn plays Dan a St. Louis sales exec who quits his job toiling for a bullying boss named Chuck (Sienna Miller gamely overdoing a brassy American accent) and starts his own company with two fellow workplace outcasts retirement-age Timothy (Tom Wilkinson) and sweet-natured but slow-witted Mike (Dave Franco you-know-whos little brother). The unlikely trio travels first to Maine then to Europe in an effort to beat out Chuck for a lucrative deal with a firm fronted by Jim Spinch (James Marsden smarming it up). Needless to say chaos ensues. But Unfinished Business never works up enough momentum to get us into the anarchic spirit of things. The movie unfolds choppily as a series of half-hearted set pieces written and directed with little flair or commitment and no connective tissue between them; some of those sequences scarcely run long enough to register as if the studio couldnt decide whether or not they were worth keeping in the final cut. Like The Wedding Ringer another mediocre male-bonding flick released during the early-2015 dump months Unfinished Business goes through the motions offering up ostensibly outrageous sights and situations -- a hotel maid whos actually a sex worker; Mikes quest to master a certain coital position; a professional negotiation hashed out amid the glory holes of a gay club -- either so derivative or so listlessly staged as to barely warrant a raised eyebrow. When its not indulging in lowbrow sex humor (not a bad thing in itself mind you) the script courtesy of Steven Conrad (The Pursuit of Happyness) tosses around some very lame jokes -- sometimes repeatedly. Much is made for instance of the fact that a main characters last name is Pancake; are you laughing yet? Even one of the movies more gently amusing bits Mikes serial mispronunciation of words like ""exploit"" and ""imperative"" is run into the ground. There are a couple of good lines strewn here and there -- Dan references Walt Whitmans ""Song of Myself"" while telling his overweight son (Britton Sear) that masturbation is OK -- but most of the dialogue is in-one-ear-out-the-other forgettable. Read more Critics Notebook Fifty Shades of Sex at Sundance Vaughns work here might be best described as functional -- he does a very slight variation on the same persona hes been playing for years the brash guy with a heart of gold. As appealing and assured a comic performer as he is the actor hasnt stretched or challenged himself in a long time; Unfinished Business makes one hope more urgently than ever that he has something else up his sleeve on the next season of True Detective. Meanwhile Wilkinsons role consists essentially of uttering words like ""pussy"" ""titty"" and ""cock"" as if the prospect of an actor of a certain age -- and a Brit at that -- cursing is all the comedy anyone needs. If the movie has a bright spot its Franco. Speaking in stoner-surfer cadences his face regularly expanding into an infectiously goofy grin the actor is the one person onscreen who seems determined to cobble together what little hes given into a distinctive character. As a director Scott is workmanlike though uninspired displaying little visual imagination and even less sense of risk. Undemanding audiences may be satisfied but Unfinished Business is the cinematic equivalent of subpar fast food (think Carls Jr. or Jack in the Box) Its cheap easy and maybe even tasty for a second or two but leaves you feeling queasy and undernourished. In other words take your business elsewhere.

A comedy with its heart in the right place and everything else bizarrely out of joint ""Unfinished Business"" finds director Ken Scott following 2013s ""Delivery Man"" with another dubious attempt to sell audiences on Vince Vaughns sensitive side. Playing a down-on-his-luck family man who takes an ill-advised business trip to Berlin with two unfunny sidekicks in tow (Tom Wilkinson and Dave Franco) Vaughn is admittedly the least of the movies worries Awkwardly wrapping a heartwarming message of self-acceptance in a layer of crude sexual humor its like a date who tries to pat you on the back with one hand while feeling you up with the other. As such ""Unfinished"" looks unlikely to do much business or to end the nearly decade-long string of mediocrities (""Fred Claus"" ""Four Christmases"" ""The Dilemma"" ""The Watch"" ""The Internship"") that has plagued its star whose fans are advised to keep whetting their appetites for the second season of ""True Detective."" Whereas ""Delivery Man"" starred Vaughn as an underachieving over-procreating man-child Scotts latest film casts him as the much more responsible Dan Trunkman a St. Louis husband and father who loves his wife (June Diane Raphael) and two kids but sometimes neglects them in his efforts to get his professional life back on track. In a prologue that suggests a discarded subplot from ""Horrible Bosses"" we see Dan quitting his job in the highly competitive mineral sales industry fed up with his ball-busting superior Chuck (Sienna Miller). Now hes striking out on his own as head of Apex Select a fledgling company hes founded with two less-than-promising associates Tim (Wilkinson) a sad-sack former colleague whos past retirement age and Mike (Dave Franco) a friendly young tagalong whos a few compartments short of a briefcase. A year later Dan seems to have successfully negotiated for Apex to be acquired by a massive firm called the Benjaminson Group -- at least until he realizes that his company is being treated as ""the fluffer"" a sort of decoy for a much bigger deal involving Dans former employer placing him in direct competition with the sneering Chuck. Although he knows he doesnt have a chance against the big boys (and girl) determined Dan insists on flying with Tim and Mike to Berlin where they hope to convince Benjaminsons corporate overlords to reconsider. Amid the ensuing shenanigans he must not only thwart Chuck and her slick confidant (James Marsden) but also make time for pep talks with his overweight teenage son (Britton Sear) and unhappy young daughter (Ella Anderson) who are having trouble fitting in at school. Its tough being a man in other words -- or so goes the logic of a movie where women tend to fall into the categories of bitchy boss supportive spouse and nameless lust object. This brand of underdog/misfit dramedy is familiar enough territory for screenwriter Steve Conrad whose scripts have largely centered around the funny-sad spectacle of an ordinary guy trying to transcend his glum material circumstances -- most recently in ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" and before that in ""The Weather Man"" and ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" still the best film produced from his work. If ""Unfinished Business"" feels like the worst its because unlike its predecessors its been forced to operate like an overly broad sex farce a genre for which neither Conrad nor director Scott demonstrates any particular flair or conviction. When Dan Tim and Mike stroll into a unisex spa in Berlin to approach a potential business ally the movie feels noticeably more embarrassed than any of the characters onscreen; communal nudity is nothing to be ashamed of but writing this witless is another story. Its not the only time the filmmakers try to appropriate Berlins sexually permissive culture for comedic purposes As luck would have it the mens visit happens to coincide with the Folsom Europe festival the continents biggest gay fetish event. Its not every mainstream comedy that extols family values in one scene and visits a glory-hole-studded mens room in another and the resulting hangout sequence (so to speak) just about works thanks to Nick Frosts disarmingly sweet performance as a forlorn but very well-endowed leather enthusiast. Still its hard to deliver a good buddy comedy when two of the buddies in question are such narrative deadweights. If Franco emerges from his brothers shadow one day itll probably be for a role that requires him to do more than grin like an idiot butcher the English language and model adventurous sexual positions with various Teutonic babes. Meanwhile watching randy old Tim do things like enlist the services of a naughty French maid is enough to make you weep if only because you wish Wilkinson had made it through his career without having to utter the words ""Im not seeing enough titty."" That leaves Vaughn as the anchor and he manages well enough despite having to tamp down his rude comic energy. The not-so-dirty little secret to the actors appeal is that hes always been a winning screen presence even (or especially) at his most vulgar and motormouthed which makes these recent pics feel particularly superfluous in their attempt to show the actors more likable side. While Scott and his team offer a fairly rushed approach to capturing their European surroundings -- a glimpse of the Berlin Marathon an Oktoberfest bacchanal a violent protest outside a G8 summit -- the movie does boast one clever touch when Dan finds himself forced to inhabit a public hotel room-cum-art installation. Its a setpiece that nicely distills all the sincere things Scott and Conrad are trying to say about the increasing transparency of American life -- now devoid of privacy overrun by social media and deadly to anyone who chooses not to conform -- rather more effectively than the movie in which theyve chosen to say it.

Ted ptaszynski says December 12 2015 at 753 pm Your wrong its funny Reply Johnny A says October 28 2015 at 1249 am I thought it as funny... Dave Franco definitely made the movie. But as for a weeknight with nothing else on it was good... I also laughed really hard and seldom do so it made my grade... it also touches on real life situations that are extreme in society today.. such as his sons self image and unhappiness and his daughters inability to cope with anger and emotions. Then most of all how hard it is for a middle age man to make a corporate business work on a small scale with self financing. Overall Id say a good comedy that made me laugh on a Wednesday night when I needed a good smile... just think it deserves more credit then it received. Why are we so critical and judgmental on films these days ? Its a comedy Not an Oscar contender. Lol Couldve been worse... couldve been Mall Cop 2... now that was a comedy that not only wasnt funny at all but aggravated the hell out of me. It made me despise the lead character and the storyline. Reply Tiana V says October 26 2015 at 946 pm I may be the only one... but I really like this movie I think because it was not what I was expecting. The movie poster makes it look like an entourage-esque buddy comedy of boys behaving badly on a business trip but it was not like that at all. It had a different feel and a different template to most light-hearted comedy films. Instead of Vince Vaughns character being an a-hole who comes to a realization and saves the day through some kind of over-coming of a character flaw he is a consistent character all the way through and his perseverance pays off. I would also like to mention the theme of cyber-bullying that is addressed in this movie it is tasteful and truthful and it was kind of just slipped in there. To Matts post below I actually think this film portrayed a person with a mental disability in a positive light. Yes he said things that were supposed to be funny but also he accomplished things and was part of a team. He wasnt treated differently he was an equal in their team which I couldnt say happens often in reality. Anyway I thought it was unique and it addressed several key issues in our lives that we may experience [Bullying family career retirement mental disability and glory holes] while still remaining clever and funny. Reply Matt Livingston says September 4 2015 at 1041 am Justin Chang characterizes ""Mike (Dave Franco) (as) a friendly young tagalong whos a few compartments short of a briefcase."" When will Hollywood and critics alike stop using the intellectually disabled as comedy props? Shame on Variety and the makers of the movie. Those bullied in the movie are addressed and cared for in a loving way but Mike is a source of ""playful"" ridicule. I am surprised that you did not call the character Mike a retard-oh but you did in so may words. It appears to me that Justin Chang is a ""few compartments short of a compassionate human being"".
