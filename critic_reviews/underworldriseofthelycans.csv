Underworld Rise of the Lycans. (R) Screen Gems (92 min.) Directed by Patrick Tatpoulos. With Rhona Mitra Bill Nighy Michael Sheen. Now playing in New Jersey. ONE AND A HALF STARS It is not necessary to have seen the first two ""Underworld"" films to fully enjoy the third. It might be helpful however to first see a bartender. Perhaps there are other ways to appreciate the film -- ways that dont include having a pre-screening pitcher of beer or several deep-bowled cocktail glasses rimmed with salt. But I cant think of them. If you havent seen the first two films -- and how I envy you -- ""Underworld"" is a series about an ancient and ongoing battle between vampires and werewolves (called ""Lycans"" here) both of whom hate each other even more than they despise us. Its hard however to root for either. The Lycans are rude and hairy. The vampires are cold and snobby. Its like a satanic college mixer with all the worst jocks grumbling on one side of the room and all the nastiest sorority sisters posing on the other. This third film -- actually a prequel -- takes us back a thousand years to see how all the bad blood began. Set in a Dark Age Europe made up of equal parts New Zealand scenery and CGI software it tells a story of interspecies love and social rebellion -- sort of ""Spartacus"" meets ""Romeo and Juliet"" but with disembowelings. Although the movie has a sense of class warfare its U.K. cast does not. One of the most interesting things about British actors is that to them a part is a part is a part. Long after they actually need the money theyll sign on for a kiddie film or a horror flick simply for the fun. So although they clearly have other better things to do Bill Nighy once again reprises his role as the waspish vampire king and Michael Sheen -- yes the honored co-star of ""Frost/Nixon"" -- returns as a soulful wolf man. (Kate Beckinsale -- sorry boys -- is not back in her catsuit however leaving Rhona Mitra to pick up the pin-up duties.) As the vampire king Nighy snarls sneers and slakes his thirst (his hunger being satisfied presumably by all the scenery hes chewing). As the fuzzy werewolf malcontent Sheen is absolutely unrecognizable for which he will be thankful in years to come. The films director is making his debut here after years of laboring over special effects and his training shows -- there are impalements aplenty and arcs of arterial blood criss-cross the screen like Roman candles. But the films palette isnt spooky or sepulchral but simply ugly -- 40 shades of grey enlivened only by the occasional splash of crimson blood. The monsters themselves have no magic no mystery no meaning -- theyre just things smashing into other things. Maybe another director might have helped this film. Maybe a couple of drinks and like-minded friends will help its audiences. But its an unnecessary sequel thats just as undead as its villains -- gleefully bloody unceasingly lifeless and with absolutely nothing at stake. Rating note The film contains gory violence and sexual situations. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

"Underworld Rise of the Lycans | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; underworld-rise-of-the-lycans ) Underworld Rise of the Lycans (United States 2009) January 23 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Ill admit to being surprised that the Underworld series has reached a third installment. Apparently these films arent that expensive to make because they have never been big box office performers. With the second movie Underworld Evolution having wrapped up things too neatly for this production to continue moving forward the filmmakers have elected to do some backtracking. This is an ""origin story"" - one that returns to the beginning and chronicles how the vampire/werewolf war started. The limitations of the Underworld saga are on display the storyline essentially replicates that of Underworld and Underworld Evolution meaning that if youve seen one or both of them theres no compelling reason to spend your hard earned dollars on the third. The reasons for watching the first two Underworld movies were simple Kate Beckinsale in a skintight leather costume lots of fast-paced action Kate Beckinsale in a skintight leather costume plenty of blood and gore and Kate Beckinsale in a skintight leather costume. The fast-paced action and blood and gore are still present in Underworld Rise of the Lycans but Kate Beckinsale is nowhere to be found (excepting a brief appearance near the end in a clip that I believe was lifted from the first film). Since Underworld would not be Underworld without the dominatrix aspect Rhona Mitra steps into the skintight leather costume. The effect is similar but not quite the same. Beckinsales husband Len Wiseman who directed the first two Underworlds before turning his attention to Live Free or Die Hard has ceded the top chair to Patrick Tatopoulos (a visual effects guru who worked on the previous two Underworld films) although he gets a story credit. Tatopoulos it should be noted does a passable job of imitating Wisemans style. The story takes us back hundreds of years to when the werewolves were slaves to the vampires. (A staunch defender of the movie might call this aspect allegorical.) Viktor (Bill Nighy) the king of the bloodsuckers has a particular fondness for Lucian (Michael Sheen) the best and bravest of his wolf bite-infected pets. Unfortunately as much as Lucian likes Viktor he likes Viktors daughter Sonja (Rhona Mitra) even more and the feeling is mutual. Since sex between vampires and lycanthropes is forbidden the two must meet in secret. Even before they are found out the affair leads to their downfall. In order to save Sonjas life Lucian must remove the collar that inhibits his shape-shifting. This is an offense that lands him in a cell and while hes there his words and actions plant the seeds for the uprising that will start the war. Those who disliked Twilight because of the way in which it defanged vampires while turning women into victims can rest easily here. Sonja is anything but a victim and the vampires especially Viktor are nasty pieces of work. The problem with Underworld Rise of the Lycans is the way in which it repeats all that has gone before forbidden love desaturated color bloody battles between CGI werewolves and all-too-destructible vampires. The whole experience feels obligatory. If the filmmakers were going to go to all the trouble to make a new chapter to this saga why not do something interesting with it? Bill Nighy who had a significant role in the first Underworld is a delight to behold in the way he gleefully overacts. This is true scenery-chewing. Heres a legitimate thespian who has elected to go as far over-the-top as the director will allow (and that turns out to be quite far). There are times when its impossible not to chuckle. This first-rate hambone performance causes the more sedate work by Michael Sheen and Rhona Mitra who take their parts seriously to fade into the background. (Although to his credit Sheen does join the party during scenes when he gets to shout snippets of ""rousing"" dialogue.) The special effects are less impressive than in the previous two installments perhaps because of budgetary restrictions. They seem like they were done cheaply and/or quickly. Granted were not expected to believe that an army of werewolves is storming a castle but neither is it supposed to be obvious that the entire sequence was put together on a computer. The level of immersion demanded by the story has not been achieved by the effects technicians. Also the fight scenes are assembled with the now-popular fast-edit technique that makes them difficult to follow. Does one have to be a fan of the series to appreciate Underworld Rise of the Lycans? Probably since the movie assumes a familiarity with the sagas mythology. The film can be watched and understood by a neophyte (although I have seen the other two I cant claim to remember them particularly well) but theres no reason why someone unfamiliar with Underworld would want to bother. The first film was significantly better and therefore is the place to start for anyone with a modicum of interest. Underworld Rise of the Lycans is an also-ran that is likely to be appreciated only by completists.

Underworld Rise of the Lycans This film should be buried | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesUnderworld Rise of the Lycans This film should be buriedThird movie in blood-hair feud thoroughly dismal.By JASON ANDERSONSpecial to the starSun. Jan. 25 2009 (out of 4)Starring Michael Sheen Bill Nighy and Rhona Mitra. Directed by Patrick Tatopoulos. 93 minutes. At major theatres. 18A Given the acclaim the British actor has received for his performances in The Queen and Frost/Nixon Michael Sheens loyalty to the decades lowliest of action-horror franchises seems inexplicable. Worse yet Sheen spends most of the latest Underworld entry sporting greasy long hair and a leather vest a combination that makes him look like a Deep Purple roadie. Even more ludicrous are the fake teeth hes forced to wear whenever his werewolf character Lucian turns bestial.Article Continued BelowWhy would a gifted thespian debase himself in such a manner especially when his Frost/Nixon co-star Frank Langella might soon be basking in Oscar glory? Alas a paycheque must be mightier than any magical weapon in the gloomy tedious Underworld universe.A prequel set long before the events of the 2003 original and its 2006 follow-up - which explains why usual headliner Kate Beckinsale is seen here only fleetingly - Underworld Rise of the Lycans is as unnecessary as it is uninvolving. Only fans desperate to learn how the whole vampire-werewolf conflict began are likely to get anything out of this viewing experience. Everyone else will just feel sorry for the cast as they joylessly go through their paces. Another actor who can be seen in more dignified fare screening elsewhere in multiplexes (Valkyrie in his case) Bill Nighy returns to the role of Viktor the ruthless vampire leader whose actions here sow the seeds for the bloodsucker-lycanthrope hostilities to come. Viktor is displeased to discover that his beloved daughter Sonja (Rhona Mitra) is secretly in love with Lucian one of the werewolves who serve as slave labour for their uppity vampire masters. A Spartacus-like rebellion among the hairy underclasses incites a series of glum dimly lit fight scenes. That most of the action takes place in the same castle setting is one indication that the third Underworld film has a much smaller budget than its predecessors. The abundance of British accents and cheap theatrics occasionally gives the movie the air of vintage Hammer Horror but it has a fatal lack of camp value. In other words this film is not nearly as much fun as its cheesiest elements (e.g. an inadvertently hilarious goth-sex scene for Sheen and Mitra or Nighys ever-expressive eyebrows) would promise. Sheen ought to have a very serious conversation with his agent. Maybe he could wear those teeth.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

ABOUT THE MOVIEUnderworld Rise of the Lycans   1/2 (out of four) Stars Michael Sheen Bill Nighy Rhona Mitra Steven MackintoshDirector Patrick TatopoulosDistributor Sony Pictures EntertainmentRating R for bloody violence and some sexualityRunning time 1 hour 32 minutesIn theaters nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Where wolf? There wolf to steal a line from Young Frankenstein. Vicious wolves are at the door of the castle and prowling around the nearby woods in Underworld Rise of the Lycans. Though its the third Underworld movie its actually the first in the series a prequel going back 1000 years and detailing the rise of a breed of werewolves known as Lycans. It also traces the roots of the Lycans bitter conflict with the ruling Death Dealers an elite squad of vampires. The highlight of this fantasy/horror hybrid is watching a pair of the best British character actors -- Bill Nighy and Michael Sheen -- shed their thespian respectability and unleash their inner beasts. A well-muscled and often bare-chested Sheen plays Lucian the part-human leader of the shaggy wolf pack. The fanged but elegant Nighy is the ace of Death Dealers. Longer in the tooth than he looks Nighys Viktor has been around and in charge for centuries. Viktor happens upon a crying abandoned baby and in a moment of weakness spares the infants life. Viktors drop of human kindness dries up quickly however. The baby grows up to be the hunky Lucian. The blood-thirsty Viktor enslaves him binding him with a silver collar to guard against his turning into a wolf by moonlight. In his malevolence Viktor also somehow creates an entire group of slaves from Lucians bloodline. But even shackles cant keep Lucian from hooking up with Viktors willful daughter Sonja (Rhona Mitra). The two share a torrid though soft-focused interspecies love scene. Sheen also starred in 2003s Underworld but not in the 2006 sequel. (His character had died and besides he was busy playing British prime minister Tony Blair in the acclaimed The Queen). Sheen seems to be having a great time as the hirsute hero. Of course its all about CGI effects and one of the coolest scenes in this installment is a kind of reverse American Werewolf in London transformation in which Lucian dramatically transforms from wolf back to man. Lucian leads the other slaves and sundry werewolves into rebellion even as Viktor throws up a series of destructive stumbling blocks. While it has a dark and occasionally muddy look this third Underworld -- whose violence is more cartoonish than gruesome -- taps into audiences continued fascination with these iconic monsters of lore. The immensely popular teen novel Twilight and its literary sequels attest to the timeless appeal of these mythic figures. But given the number of vampire and werewolf movies it can be a challenge to keep the genre fresh. This incarnation would never be considered inventive -- the story is simple bordering on silly -- and some fight scenes blur into each other. Still Underworld Rise of the Lycans is surprisingly campy fun mostly succeeding through the power of its lead performances.

Yes Underworld Rise of the Lycans is basically Were-Spartacus though that makes the humorless scare-free result sound much more fun than it is. Sheen and Nighy do their best with the material but this is easily the worst Underworld so far. Indeed the whole blue-hued shebang comes across like some sadistic test for those people such as your writer who previously believed they would happily sit through anything that featured either one of these fine actors.

"In Underworld roots tale historys a dull subject - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies MOVIE REVIEW Underworld Rise of the Lycans In Underworld roots tale historys a dull subject By Joel Brown Globe Correspondent / January 26 2009 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + ""Underworld Rise of the Lycans"" is a dark and stormy prequel reaching back to the Middle Ages to explain the roots of the centuries-long war between werewolves and vampires seen in 2003s ""Underworld"" and 2006s ""Underworld Evolution."" The great mystery here though is Rhona Mitras upper lip which appears merely plump in some shots and grossly overinflated in others.Mitra is Sonja the lovely and brave daughter of vampire lord Viktor played by the great Bill Nighy in a sort of Christopher Lee/Peter Cushing homage complete with eerily glowing blue eyes. Viktor rules over a gi-normous castle and surrounding lands where the locals live in fear of marauding werewolves. Viktor has managed to breed himself a race of werewolf Lycans who do odd jobs around the castle and live as captives in the dungeons. Like many of us these days they seem under-employed which makes them restless.The progenitor of all the Lycans is the brave Lucian played by Michael Sheen. Draped in leather and chains Lucian looks like a heavy metal guitarist on a hot day at Ozzfest. Which is to say over-amped and more than a little ripe. But love has no pride. If youve already guessed that Lucian and Sonja are having it off in a secret tunnel under the castle give yourself a gold star. Their forbidden passion is discovered Lucian calls a Lycan/werewolf revolt like a toothy Che Guevara and things get bloody.Director Patrick Tatopoulos was responsible for the creature effects in the two earlier installments but hes not great at staging fights or directing actors. Most scenes beg for the ""Mystery Science Theater"" treatment.Fans of the ""Underworld"" mythology will no doubt be gratified to learn how it all started out. But first-timers may find themselves confused - for starters the slavering blood-drenched werewolves are good guys in this one. Sort of. Trying to dope out a message about freedom and self-determination here will just give you a headache. (c) Copyright 2009 Globe Newspaper Company.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet For a bunch of movies essentially predicated on the lizard-brain pleasures of watching werewolves and vampires like totally whaling on each other the Underworld series sure has a lot of complicated backstory. The frustrating thing is it doesnt contribute much to the films. All the mythos gave Underworld and Underworld Evolution an ornate backdrop for their Matrix-y slo-mo gunfights and chilly goth aesthetic but they still suffered from simpleminded plots unworthy of all the detail. The new prequel Underworld Rise Of The Lycans continues the trend. Set in a vague medieval-ish past it opens with a hefty chunk of history about how a clan of castle-dwelling vampires led by Bill Nighy (reprising his role from the first two films) bred up a race of intelligent werewolf slaves called Lycans. The Lycan progenitor Michael Sheen (also back for the second time and miles from his award-winning roles in the likes of The Queen and Frost/Nixon) is a growly but circumspect servant until he and Nighys ass-kickin vampire daughter (Rhona Mitra) fall into the kind of love that can only be expressed with a tasteful sex montage and a lot of glowery yearning. Together they rebel against Nighy with consequences that are eminently predictable. And not just because there are only two ways for by-the-book Romeo amp; Juliet knockoffs to end tragically or happily ever after. This story was already told in its entirety as part of Underworlds convoluted backstory. Lycans helmed by longtime creature-designer and first-time director Patrick Tatopoulos just repeats the tale again at feature length as a sequence of face-offs fights and floggings that lead to an ending which Underworld fans--the only people likely to care about installment number three--already know. So whats the point? Well mostly its about another round of that chilly gothic whaling. But all the usual elements seem halfhearted this time out thanks to generic sets flat cinematography boring one-dimensional characters an insultingly shallow and charisma-free central love affair werewolves that look like rubber-masked men in ape suits and so forth. The big bright spots are Sheen slumming it with passionate vigor and Nighy who sucks the blood from the scenery with enunciation that sounds like hes gingerly talking around a mouthful of caltrops. If everyone else threw themselves into their roles so vividly... well Rise Of The Lycans would still be clumsy ephemeral and wholly unnecessary. But at least thered be a few more surprises.

Auds are encouraged to cheer the werewolves in ""Underworld Rise of the Lycans"" the third chapter in the ongoing franchise about a centuries-long battle between bloodsuckers and shape-shifters. Taking over the directorial reins from Len Wiseman who remains onboard as a producer first-time helmer Patrick Tatopoulos (who designed creatures for all three pics) offers a satisfyingly exciting monster rally that often plays like a period swashbuckler. Notably less frenetic (and appreciably more coherent) than its predecessors new entry scared up 20.6 million at the B.O. on its opening weekend. First two pics -- ""Underworld"" (2003) and ""Underworld Evolution"" (2006) -- celebrated the derring-do of Selene (Kate Beckinsale) a kick-ass leather-clad vampire warrior who sliced and diced Lycans (aka werewolves) in various contemporary European locales. But the newest chapter a thousand-years-earlier prequel shifts the spotlight to Lucian the Lycan leader played as in the first two episodes by Michael Sheen (""The Queen"" ""Frost/Nixon""). Illuminating and expanding the mythos introduced in the first ""Underworld"" scripters Danny McBride Dirk Blackman and Howard McCain set their scenario in an unnamed land (pic was shot in New Zealand) where aristocratic vampires led by the autocratic Viktor (series regular Bill Nighy) reside in a fortified castle while ruling -- and occasionally draining -- humans throughout the region. Outside the castle walls marauding werewolves prowl through the woods feasting indiscriminately on the living and the undead. Inside however the vampires enslave a special breed of the lupine bogeymen known as Lycans forcing the wretches to wear special collars that prevent them from shape-shifting into humongous wolves. Lucian a blacksmith who forges weaponry to use against werewolves is treated with special favor by Viktor who looks upon the Lycan as if not a son then a favorite pet. But their relationship sours when Viktor learns Lucian is having a forbidden affair with Sonja (Rhona Mitra) a formidable vampire warrior and Viktors daughter. Beckinsale appears only fleetingly in ""Rise of the Lycans"" -- at the very end -- and her near-total absence is bound to disappoint longtime fans of the series. Mitra has undeniable screen presence -- shes easy on the eyes and handy with a sword -- and her performance is more than adequate but even though shes suitably spirited while hacking her way through clusters of lycanthropes her Sonja never achieves the pop-icon impact of Beckinsales Selene. On the other hand Sheen is robustly dynamic as Lucian a character portrayed as an arch-villain in the earlier ""Underworld"" pics. Here Lucian actually is the hero -- a little like a Spartacus of the Lycans leading enslaved humans and werewolves in a rebellion against their cruel vampire masters -- and Sheen hits all the right notes in a star-powered performance that will amuse if not amaze anyone who only knows the actor as Tony Blair or David Frost. Once again Nighy offers a sly and stylish turn as Viktor the blue-eyed vampire king whose elegant menace can quickly escalate into full-bore fury. And Steven Mackintosh yet another three-time participant is arrestingly ambiguous as Tannis Viktors devious underling. Ace production design emphasizes a Dark Ages version of the black-on-black Goth-flavored look of the earlier pics. Man-into-werewolf transformations are credibly accomplished although theres a distinctly cartoonish quality to the big wolves that run in packs during the extended climax. There are fewer large-scale battles here than in previous ""Underworld"" adventures and a couple of stretches are talky. But the performances are forceful enough to keep things interesting even when no one is sprouting fangs or drinking blood.

The Welsh actor has built his aboveground rep impersonating glad-handing Brit public figures Tony Blair in The Deal and The Queen David Frost in Frost/Nixon. Simultaneously and subterraneanly hes also been a wolf-man Lucian the half-breed in the Underworld thrillers whose first two installments from 2003 and 2006 grossed about 200 million worldwide. Its entirely possible that no single moviegoer has seen both the smooth Sheen and the hairy Sheen -- the one in the Savile Row suits and the one whos spent enough time at the gym to acquire the torso worthy of a B-movie action figure. Today hes outed. Frost/Nixon which since early December has been tiptoeing through a few big-city theaters and yesterday garnered five Oscar nominations (including one for Best Picture) breaks out into wide release. And Underworld Rise of the Lycans the third in the vampire-werewolf saga is playing on thousands of screens hoping to end the weekend as the No. 1 box-office hit. The films makers shouldnt hope to pick up any Academy Awards when next years nominations are announced since the enterprise is sluggish when its not grinding toward the preposterous. (See Richard Corlisss wrap of this years Oscar nominations.) Returning to the Underworld franchise must stir conflicting emotions in Sheen. Six years ago when he made the first film he was a supporting player to his then girlfriend Kate Beckinsales Selene a vision in pancake face blood red lipstick and black leather. Then she went off with the movies director Len Wiseman -- ouch. Since then Beckinsale has played Ava Gardner in The Aviator and more or less Judith Miller in Nothing But the Truth; Wiseman graduated to directing the very snappy fourth Die Hard movie; and Sheen became an upmarket character star. Now hes top-billed as Lucian the hybrid Lycan. This is an ""origins"" movie set long before the other two in which war between the vampires and the werewolves had been raging for hundreds of years and Selene fell in love with the Lycan Michael (Scott Speedman) to the chagrin of her father Viktor (Bill Nighy). Lycans describes the birth and early career of Lucian whom Viktor at first spares and nurtures then chains and pursues when his daughter Sonya (Rhona Mitra) falls in love with the handsome lycanthrope. To Viktor Lucian is suitable as a protector not as a son-in-law. Finally making explicit the class warfare between the sexy-snooty vampires and their vassals Rise of the Lycans establishes Lucian as your basic pulp hero lumpen nobleman rabble-rouser and messiah. Hes part Jesus especially in the Gospel according to Mel Gibson (Lucian takes a lashing and keeps on gnashing) and part Spartacus come to free the slaves -- or are they pets -- kept by the vampire overlords. In a dungeon or on a dark redoubt Lucian offers his surly band of rebels ""freedom and immortality"" (Wasnt that Tony Blairs campaign slogan when Labour ousted the Tories in 97?) Id provide more detail of plot and dialogue but the visual palette was way too dark for me to take legible notes and frankly though I saw it at a midnight screening hours ago the movie just wasnt that memorable. Suffice to say that theres much bounding about by furry blurry CGI werewolves quite a few decapitations and a poignant but nifty crisping of one of the vampires when exposed to sunlight. Being set in an earlier day (night) Lycans renounces the whizzing Matrix-like bullets of the first two movies for swords and a heavy-metal bow-and-arrow contraption that brings certain death to just about anyone but Lucian. When a film is directed by a Frenchman (Patrick Tatopoulos) whos spent most of his career designing ugly creatures for movies like this and written by a stuntman (Danny McBride) you can expect it to be heavier on the action scenes than on character elucidation. The Brit cast attempts to camouflage the silliness by swanning it up as if the Royal Shakespeare Company had gotten communally drunk and staged an impromptu production of Dracula Meets the Wolfman. Sheen tries bravely to keep a straight face especially during his love scenes with Mitra a TV grad (Party of Five Gideons Crossing The Practice Boston Legal Nip/Tuck) who looks like the spawn of Steven Tyler and Katrina vanden Heuvel. Whos left to watch? Nighy. If the Academy handed out an award for Best Overacting he would win every year. A stalwart of British theater particularly David Hare plays he is most warmly remembered by movie audiences for playing the drug-addled rock star Billy Mack in Love Actually and the pirate Davy Jones in the last two Pirates of the Caribbean offerings. (He also appears his emoting confined to the standard range as one of Tom Cruises cohorts in Valkyrie.) Here outfitted with piercing powder blue eyes Nighy ascends to scenery-devouring heights that obliterate the boundary between O.K. and awful. You may smile or cringe at Nighys malefic majesty but either way you will savor it. At the climax someone tells Lucian that its finally over. ""No"" he insists ""this is just beginning."" Is that a promise or a threat? The weekend box office will determine the fate of the Underworld series -- and whether Sheen continues as his wolfish man-god or goes on to make the planned sequel to The Queen in which Tony Blair hooks up with Bill Clinton. Now if he were to play Blair as the lapdog to George W. Bush that would be a horror comedy to cherish. See TIMEs Pictures of the Week.

"Movie review Underworld Rise of the Lycans -- 2 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Underworld Rise of the Lycans -- 2 out of 5 stars Rhona Mitra Sony Rhona Mitra Rhona Mitra (Sony) Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic It takes a few minutes to get the mind and the eyes around the fact that yes thats the great Brit-thespian Michael Sheen impersonator of Tony Blair (The Deal The Queen) and David Frost (Frost/Nixon) transforming into a werewolf in Underworld Rise of the Lycans. But it is Sheen all buff and hairy and toothy giving his all in a struggle with vampire Bill Nighy over the vamps fanged daughter played by Rhona Mitra.That cast makes this prequel to the movies that showed the world how good Kate Beckinsale looks in leather worth watching. Underworld  a tale of the feud between werewolves and vampires and their immortal daylight-hours protectors ""Lycans"" morphs into a Spartacus with fangs in the third film. The vampires and their leader have enslaved the first Lycans keeping them from transforming into werewolves with these magical lock-collars. And Lucian ""the first Lycan"" (Sheen) a lowly blacksmith kept around to kill ""your own kind"" (werewolves) must lead the other Lycans to freedom.Lucien is an inspiring leader and a dynamic speaker as youd expect from the onetime talk-show host and former head of Britains Labour Party. ""You have a choice"" he bellows ""freedom instead of pestilence"" and slavery. This Braveheart wants to drive a stake through the heart of their masters.But the cadaverous Viktor (Nighy reprising his role from the first two Underworlds) is cunning. Hes not about to let his slaves revolt even if Lucian is ""a credit to your race.""The ""pestilence"" has to do with how these creatures were born -- a virus that made the original ""immortal"" Corvinus. Hes referenced in the film (Derek Jacobi played him in the original Underworld) and there are other efforts to tie the film into the Underworld continuum including a cameo in the finale. That virus is what is passed on by biting.The effects-designer-turned-director of Lycans has shot a dark-on-dark film with most of the action cast in the shadows -- assaults by waves of digital werewolves dungeons the blue-black castle keep where the vampires rule the roost. The sword fights (vampires need weapons to dispatch werewolves) are properly bloody and cut in a seizure-inducing blur. The film would all be a complete bore if it werent for the odd sparks of wit and the sparks set off by Sheen and B-picture queen Mitra. Vampires and werewolves could teach India a little something for the Kama sutra.But theyve finished their trilogy and explained (sort of) the origins of this fictional universe. Now that theres enough vampire-Lycan bloodletting for a boxed set perhaps theyll put these dogs (and bats) to rest.

The digital video images are blurry the fight scenes messy the editing jerky and the derivative plot absurdly overwrought (Romeo and Juliet and Spartacus?). A millennium before his death at the end of Underworld Michael Sheens love-struck Lycan Lucian falls for Sonja (slab-faced Doomsday star Rhona Mitra) the rebellious daughter of vampire leader Viktor (Bill Nighy). If their illicit cross-species love affair is discovered Sonja is toast so the half-human Lucian embraces his suppressed blood-lust unleashes his inner beast and leads a Lycan slave revolt. Set-bound and sluggish this relies far too heavily on spasmodic bursts of bloodletting and variable CGI effects. If it is worth seeing at all it is for the sterling contributions of its three leading British thesps Nighys ham-on-wry imperiousness Sheens straggle-haired ferocity and Stephen Macintoshs quietly effective turn as the sneakily ambitious archivist Tannis.

I enjoyed seeing Tony Blair as the lead wolf dude Lucian. Agree with the Time Out review about the overuse of CGI and artificial sets. Could the producers not spend a bit of extra money and film in a real castle or forest?? Anyway after watching this film I actually think it might be best for new viewers to see this first and then follow it with the other Underworld films. That way Lucian will be viewed as a good guy in the first film because you will understand his backstory.
