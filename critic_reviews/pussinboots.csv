This spin-off - effectively a prequel - sees outlaw Puss returning to rural Spain where he joins childhood friend Humpty Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis) and feisty feline Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) in an attempt to steal the magic beans from Jack and Jill and find the goose that laid the golden egg.The plot is drawn out and lacks emotional impact the whole trip up the beanstalk feels like filler. But plenty of irresistible set pieces have charm to spare whether its a cat dance-off in a seedy barn or a flashback to Pusss youth when he is - cute alert - a huge-eyed little kitten. As ever much of the humour mixes anthropomorphism with well-observed reminders of Pusss feline status watch him lap up a hard shot of milk with glee. Puss in Boots is uneven but when its on course cat fans will be in heaven.

It starts well and the chemistry between puss and kitty is great but apart from that the film is a disappointment. Humptys character is poor and the supposed change in his character is all to symptomatic of a Hollywood focus group. The studios must try harder. The film is too long and the plot what it is is too thin and strung out. Like Tintin a disappointment from film makers who should know better and seem to be going through the motions. 2 stars only I am afraid. Its ok and it will keep kids occupied but that is it. Its is fair not good and sadly much more could and should have been made of this.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 9 2011enjoyed itFeaturedThe animation is wonderful the cat characters cute the plot pretty random. Not enough catness going on and too much Humpty. Also the comment cat people are crazy seems a bit odd coming from a character who seems specifically to have been designed to appeal to cat people. Nevertheless I enjoyed this mainly because of the look of it and the central performances particularly Antonio Banderas.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map },http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/90411/puss-in-boots.html,200,pussinboots0,pussinboots,timeout

"Puss in Boots review Furry swashbuckler takes center stage |       NJ.com comments Puss in Boots review Furry swashbuckler takes center stage Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 28 2011 at 714 AM View/Post Comments DreamWorks AnimationPuss in Boots voiced by Antonio Banderas was introduced in the aShreka movies and becomes a leading feline in the new movie named after him. I love imitating Antonio Banderas. Who doesnt love imitating Antonio Banderas? Lower your chin raise your eyebrow drop you voice half an octave. Then very slowly purr ""Ooooooooh ..."" But lately no one has had more fun gently imitating Banderas than ... well Banderas. His sly burlesque of his own image -- or more precisely the Latin lover one that Hollywood tried to keep him in -- was one of the funniest additions to the ever-expanding ""Shrek"" universe. And now that character gets his own origin story with ""Puss in Boots"" -- which fitting its hero is a little heavier on romance and adult situations than the films about the jolly green ogre. There are a couple of jokes about Puss prowess in the bedroom and maybe two too many crotch gags. Theres even a naughty reference to medical catnip. (""Its for my glaucoma"" Puss insists.) Most of the lines though should pass right over the heads of any little ones -- who will be too busy anyway enjoying the films furious catfights and Mother Goose rewrites. Set far far away from Shreks fairy-tale land the nicely designed film (catch it in 3-D and Imax if you can) takes place in a Spaghetti Western world where the desperado Puss is on the run -- and soon meets up vocally at least with Banderas ""Desperado"" co-star Salma Hayek. Outfitted with a Catwoman mask shes the famed cat burglar Kitty Softpaws -- and working with that egghead mastermind Humpty Dumpty to steal the Goose That Lays the Golden Eggs. Will Puss join them? And can he trust either of them? Puss and Humpty have a history you see -- and the film slows a bit when it goes into a long flashback explaining it. (Even Kitty takes a catnap during the telling.) Later on it all leads to a few plot twists that are too clever by half and not quite believable. Yes even in a film about a talking cat in footwear plausibility counts for something. But -- ""Ooooooooh"" -- Banderas has great fun teasing his too-sexy-for-you style (which he totally inverted earlier this month in the great and shocking ""The Skin I Live In""). And Hayek is happy to join him in it investing her lines with plenty of spice. Add a supporting vocal cast that includes Zach Galifianakis as the hard-boiled Humpty Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris as Jack and Jill (and in an in-joke executive producer Guillermo del Toro as the lawman on Puss trail) and you have an almost purr-fect little film that even a dog owner can enjoy. As can any parent -- with or without children in tow. Ratings note The film contains a few very mildly grown-up gags. Puss in Boots (PG) Paramount (90 min.) Directed by Chris Miller. With the voices of Antonio Banderas Salma Hayek Zach Galifianakis. Now playing in New Jersey.

So far as I could gather as a child they were merely brother and sister and for all were told in the Shrek spin-off Puss in Boots they might still be. What really matters is that Jack has the magic beans the beans that grow the beanstalk that leads to the magic castle that hides the Golden Goose and its this fortunate fowl that Humpty-Dumpty (voiced by Zach Galifianakis) wants to keep for himself. The problem is the rotund brainiac cant get those beans himself. Hell need the well cat-like reflexes of estranged childhood pal Puss (Antonio Banderas) and the equally frisky Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek -- Desperado reunion). This is the point weve reached with our kiddie fare. Who needs one traditional fairy tale when a spin-off of a send-up bearing its own genre influences -- Puss Kitty and Humpty as the Good the Bad and the Ugly reimagined as the Noble the Suave and the Misguided -- will do? Dont worry Im not decrying the endless effortless repurposing of anything and everything remotely enjoyable (not today anyway). Puss is a generally amusing time-waster if distinctly falling into the minor ranks of DreamWorks Animation and yes I do believe theres such a distinction to be made in the wake of How to Train Your Dragon and the original Shrek. But enough hair-splitting (More like fur-splitting Sorry.) Many of the jokes are derived from obvious touches of anthropomorphization -- its made clear from the start that Puss tends to be a lover and leaver -- and even simpler displays of familiar feline behavior (and if egg puns are your thing then boy are you in luck). But much of the actually effective humor comes from goofier gags such as the cheeky use of split-screens the charming introduction of ancillary characters who pop up just to make things awkward the fleeting equivalence between catnip and marijuana and the sly role reversal between Billy Bob Thorntons Jack and Amy Sedaris Jill (he wants a baby; shes not interested). Save for an extended origin story flashback the length of which makes for its own nudging joke director Chris Miller (Shrek the Third) keeps the ball of yarn rolling and while the look of the land is expectedly lush throughout the Spanish villas and desert environments cant help but pale a bit in comparison to the similarly striking settings of this years other animation Western Rango. The voice casting of Banderas and Hayek is about as seductively spot-on as one would imagine though Galifianakis couldnt be much more generically whiny and scheming. Does any of this really justify a Shrek sidekick getting his very own franchise? Not quite but far be it from me to kill off this particular golden goose. By design Puss in Boots is amiable enough to validate its own existence. The character may be here to save the day but the movies only here to pass the time and it does that just fine.

Jennie Punter The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 28 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Its been six years since Antonio Banderas last donned Zorros mask on the silver screen. But the Spanish thespian kept his suave sword-wielding desperado persona intact as the scene-stealing feline sidekick in the animated Shrek franchise and has finally clawed his way into the spotlight in the gravity-defying spin-off spectacle Puss in Boots. Screen grab from the online trailer for the animated feature ""Puss in Boots"" featuring the voice of Antonio Banderas Movies Puss in Boots The official trailer When last we saw the ginger Puss in the fourth and final Shrek flick he (like so many retired mousers and action stars) had kicked off his boots and become a pampered flabby house pet. But the folks at DreamWorks have taken a tip from the superhero universe and scratched out an action-packed origin story for the kitty - one that bears closer resemblance (in specific scenes) to Spaghetti Westerns the Step Up dance movies The Usual Suspects and Godzilla than it does to ""Le Maitre Chat ou Le Chat Botte"" the story penned by Charles Perrault for his 17th-century collection that popularized Puss (not to mention Sleeping Beauty Cinderella et al.) for the ages. While Pusss fame as a character has endured the Perrault fairy tale (Puss uses his kitty wiles to convince the king that his master a millers son is a rich marquis worthy of the princesss hand in marriage) hasnt exactly enchanted animators. Walt Disney turned Puss into a bullfighter in his 1922 Laugh-O-Gram short; in 1934 Ub Iwerks paired him with a bagpipe player and a litter of kittens to rescue a princess from an ogre. In those shorts and subsequent animated and live-action versions of the story the weakest link is Pusss master - a bumpkin compared to the loquacious quick-witted cat. What Puss needs is a worthy foil. And the DreamWorks team striving to cook up a buddy comedy certainly hatched one in Humpty Dumpty voiced by man-boy du jour Zach Galifianakis ( The Hangover). The eggman takes over Pusss role as crafty instigator from Perraults fairy tale. Humpty is not only all face (visually speaking) but two-faced as we learn in a flashback story that Puss relates to Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) - a mysterious cat-burglar-for-hire and unfortunately a lacklustre token female character who serves as a romantic partner for Puss. Growing up in the orphanage in the village of San Ricardo Puss and Humpty became fast friends and partners in petty crime until Puss saved the local lawmans mother and decided to go straight. After Humpty tricked Puss into participating in a bank heist the egg got picked up by (you guessed it) all the kings men and thrown into jail while Puss fell into life on the lam. Now the recently escaped Humpty is trying to recruit Puss in an elaborate scheme to steal a handful of magic beans from Jack and Jill (a thuggish couple wonderfully voiced by Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris). Puss reluctantly agrees to put the past behind him only after Humpty promises that any booty retrieved from the top of the beanstalk will be used to pay back the bank and thus restore their honour in the village. The films standout sequence is a surreal adventure into the clouds where Puss Kitty and Humpty eventually find the golden-egg-laying goose (actually a gosling). Not surprisingly as soon as they hit the ground the egg flips again. Puss in Boots is essentially non-stop dazzling action scenes loosely connected by a thin predictable story of greed versus good. Of course Shrek humour also invades this fairy tale landscape (a dusty desert in contrast to the lush forests of Shrek). At one point Pusss catnip stash is confiscated - ""its for my glaucoma"" he pleads. Banderass fabulous vocal performance gives real weight to Puss - you swear the guy is wearing a cat suit - but overall the character is more reactive than active. Its the morally-cracked Humpty who provides the films emotional trajectory. Puss in Boots is a fun feline frolic - with just a little egg on its face.

(And thats a good thing.) Starring Antonio Banderas Zach Galifianakis Salma Hayek Billy Bob Thornton Amy Sedaris Constance Marie Guillermo del Toro Rich Dietl Ryan Crego Tom Wheeler Director Chris Miller Running time 130 Release Opened Oct 28 2011  Editorial Review Beyond Shrek a cat o fine talesBy Michael OSullivanFriday Oct 28 2011""Puss in Boots"" proves there is at least one cat with multiple lives. The feature-length animated spinoff - a star turn for the popular ""Shrek"" supporting character voiced by Antonio Banderas - is almost shockingly good. And not just because a lot of you will approach it with lowered expectations. Lets be honest. After appearances in the last three ""Shrek"" outings who would have thought that Puss would land on his feet when thrown into a movie of his own? It turns out he does mainly because the movie tosses him in a completely new direction and about as far far away from the earlier films as possible. Oh the character is still something of a delusional Casanova. And the action is still set in the world of fairy tales. Jack and Jill Humpty Dumpty magic beans and the goose that lays the golden eggs all figure prominently here. But the story - written and directed by a bunch of people you probably never heard of but executive-produced by Guillermo del Toro (director of ""Hellboy"") who also contributes a minor voice or two - has been given a spicy spaghetti-western kick. Set in the fictional Southwestern border town of San Ricardo ""Puss in Boots"" centers on Pusss efforts to steal the aforementioned goose from a giants castle in the clouds access to which is only afforded by a magical beanstalk. Assisting him in this adventure are his childhood pal Humpty Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis) and rival cat burglar Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) who is naturally Pusss love interest. Their competition is a pair of outlaws Jack and Jill played with delightful orneriness by Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris. Yes the voice talent is another reason the film works so well. Theres no stunt casting just good solid performances even down to the bit parts. Im quite certain youve never heard of animator Bob Persichetti either but I guarantee youll never forget his vocal performance in a role known only as ""Ohhh Cat."" Its priceless. The animation - filled with images of red-rock buttes and majestic canyonlands - is gorgeous. But the filmmakers know better than to take things - or themselves - too seriously. Theres a healthy amount of silliness here too. Humptys full name is Humpty Alexander Dumpty. Why? Just because it sounds so ridiculous. And just because Galifianakis sounds like an Alexander. His Humpty is a PG version of the sweetly earnest but morally dubious character he played in ""The Hangover."" Then theres the giddily feather-brained flamenco-meets-""You Got Served""-style dance-off between Puss and Kitty. It is to die for. For a kids movie the humor at times strays a bit too far into grown-up territory. There are jokes about a feline one-night stand a portion of the male anatomy and the equation of catnip with an illegal herb of another sort. ""Its for my glaucoma"" says Puss after authorities have confiscated his stash before throwing him in jail. (""Whats glaucoma?"" my son asked. That led to a discussion of medical marijuana.) Im not saying these jokes arent funny. They are as is the whole movie. Its just that they flirt with a line that doesnt need to be crossed in order to get - and to hold - Mommy and Daddys attention. ""Puss in Boots"" can do that all by itself without resorting to being un gato malo. Contains cartoon action a death and a bit of earthy humor.

So his solo foray is a welcome addition to animated family fare.Here the dashing cat with the seductive purr meets his clever match and finds romance with the sassy Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) and also embarks on an adventure with his old pal/nemesis Humpty Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis).PHOTOS This week at the moviesWith his impeccable comic timing and lyrical Spanish accent Banderas swashbuckling charmer is an undeniable treat. There could be no more perfect voice to match the visual. The lively romp is well-acted cleverly written and vividly rendered despite an over-the-top finale. Even the 3-D elements dazzle during swooping chases. An early sequence in a cat cantina features startlingly deft choreography as Puss flamencos his way into the path of the alluring pickpocket Kitty Softpaws. Puss and Kittys sultry paws-de-deux is one of the movies most entertaining scenes. Puss always lands on his feet in the dance-off with the slinky Kitty highlighted by a hilarious litter-box shuffle.About the moviePuss in Boots    out of fourVoices Antonio Banderas Amy Sedaris Zach Galifianakis Billy Bob Thornton Salma Hayek Director Chris MillerDistributor Paramount Pictures Rating PG for some adventure action and mild rude humor Running time 1 hour 30 minutes Opens today nationwideAccording to this yarn Puss is a legendary outlaw. Inside hes a softie -- or at least he knows how to use his adorable big-eyed expression to soften the resistance of those around him. The tale explains how he came to be on the prowl. The events offer him a chance to redeem himself something parents with impressionable children will appreciate.The story has just the right blend of child-centered silliness and winking adult humor. When caught by the cops with catnip Puss quips ""Its for my glaucoma.""Puss in Boots is blessedly not a sequel or a prequel. No Shrek stars pop by for cameos. Though he may be a spinoff this Puss stands alone in his tall boots. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Having strip mined every last nickel out of ""Shrek DreamWorks Animation has moved on to ""Puss in Boots a spinoff/prequel centering on one of the franchises more amusing one-note characters. This relentlessly mediocre cartoon is less interested in how Puss got his boots than a throwaway gag about their being crafted out of ""fine Corinthian leather. But we still get an elaborate back story narrated by Puss in the dulcet tones of Antonio Banderas far better represented on Americas screens this month by his twisted scientist in ""The Skin I Live In. Basically this toon is a tired riff on Sergio Leones spaghetti Westerns punctuated by more puns and cat jokes than you can shake a litter box at. Banderas manages to get away with jokes about ""medical catnip. But unfortunately the proceedings pretty much get hijacked by the title characters childhood friend from a Spanish orphanage Humpty Dumpty (voiced by Zach Galifianakis who turns out to be even more grating as a voice artist than as a live-action actor). Nursing a grudge against Puss because of a failed bank robbery that ended with his falling off a wall Humpty guilt-trips our hero into participating in a plot to steal the Golden Goose from Jack and Jill (Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris largely wasted). The designated feisty heroine the cross-dressing and double-crossing Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) at one point dances a flamenco with Puss. And its all in eye-straining 3-D listlessly directed by Chris Miller (""Shrek the Third). Mostly I was bored out of my skull for an hour and a half that felt like it consumed an entire afternoon. Most of the kids at the screening I attended also seemed to have fallen into a stupor. DreamWorks Animation distributor Paramount is reportedly gearing up its own cartoon division as an alternative to the likes of ""Puss in Boots. Small wonder There was more entertainment in five minutes of Paramounts non-DWA ""Rango than in the entire running time of this mangy stiff.

"Movie review Puss in Boots - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-BootsMovie review Puss in BootsThe stylish and fun 3-D animated movie mixes hard-boiled adventure nursery-rhyme characters and a charismatic cat voiced by Antonio Banderas that you dont want to cross.October 28 2011|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas) left and Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek)... (DreamWorks Animation )Dashing hat with debonair feather? Check. Footwear made for walking? Check. Alluring Spanish accent? Double check. The cat is back. After supporting roles in three ""Shrek"" movies the feisty feline Puss in Boots finally has a film of his own and those who have cried out for animated justice will be saying ""Its about time."" A treat to experience visually (especially in lively 3-D) and verbally ""Puss in Boots"" is a family film where the adventure and invention never flag and the tongue-in-cheek humor doesnt linger far behind. PHOTOS Puss in Boots premiere Naturally Antonio Banderas returns as the cat who doesnt lack for self-esteem joined this time by an expert idiosyncratic voice cast including Salma Hayek Zach Galifianakis Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris. As written by Tom Wheeler (sharing story credit with Brian Lynch and Will Davies) and directed by Chris Miller ""Puss"" as is often the case with contemporary superhero movies presents something of an origins tale setting out to explain how the cat who walks like a man a but still laps up milk with his tongue a became the most feared of creatures. Determined in the ""Shrek"" tradition to bring in as many movie and popular culture references as possible ""Puss"" opens with a nod to the romantic exploits of James Bond and frequently channels the westerns of Sergio Leone but its most pervasive influence is film noir. In an inspired move this film recasts ""Puss"" protagonists as if they were genre luminaries having a hard-boiled adventure. Think of this Puss as being sired by Raymond Chandler with Mother Goose and youll begin to get the idea. PHOTOS Cats in film The purr-formances When we first meet Puss hes on the run from the law searching for a way to simultaneously clear his name and repay an old debt. Humans may chuckle when the cat casts a long shadow as he walks into a bar but that laughter dies in their throats. As Puss himself puts it ""You do not want to make the cat angry."" Its in a bar that Puss hears about the exploits of the murderous outlaws Jack and Jill enthusiastically voiced by Thornton and Sedaris. When they check into a hotel ask about the continental breakfast and snarl ""Dont even think of skimping on the baby muffins"" youd best pay attention. These two reprobates have gotten their hands on some genuine magic beans and clearly intend to use them to grow a beanstalk that will take them to the goose that lays the legendary golden eggs. Unless Puss gets his paws on them first. But two can play this game and Puss finds he has a rival for the beans in the attractive form of the gifted Kitty Softpaws (Hayek) a slick-fingered seductress with the best criminal hands in Spain. In the best noir tradition Kitty happens to be the cats paw so to speak of the great criminal mind of the age Humpty Alexander Dumpty. Yes its an egg but as splendidly voiced by Galifianakis an egg that is as glib and manipulative as ""Chinatowns"" Noah Cross. The egg as it turns out is also an old childhood friend of Puss and what happened to them growing up in an orphanage in the sleepy village of San Ricardo is the key to what happens today. Is it true as Puss grimly insists that ""the scars run too deep"" for reconciliation or does Humpty deserve a second chance to prove he is a good egg and not a rotten one? Working this relationship out involves enough plot for a three-picture deal and the films chases and adventures unwind almost nonstop with great visual style and flair. Essential in keeping everything moving at a rapid clip is Henry Jackmans driving score which features Leone riffs as well as flamenco guitar. Some of the most entertaining moments are of all things sizzling dance duets between Puss and Kitty (choreographed by Laura Gorenstein Miller of L.A.s Helios Dance Theater) which give ""Dancing With the Stars"" a whole new meaning. Perhaps the most engaging thing about ""Puss in Boots"" is that it never takes itself too seriously. Even the DreamWorks Animation logo gets into the act as the fishing line of the boy in the moon morphs into a crackling bullwhip. Its that kind of a film.

This wise and beautiful little film is about two lovers falling from a state of grace. Watch a clip of Paramounts ""Like Crazy."" The outward impediment to their romance is a bureaucratic tangle. Anna (Felicity Jones) a vivacious young Englishwoman in her senior year at a California college falls in love with Jacob (Anton Yelchin) a touchingly tender young American whos been studying furniture design. After graduation she overstays her student visa by a couple of months to spend the summer with him. After a quick trip home to visit her parents Anna returns to California where U.S. immigration officials discover her visa violation refuse her entry and put her on the next flight back to London. At a time when illegal immigration is a hot-button topic Annas troubles might seem trivial. But her offense and the complicated long-distance relationship that ensues are only pretexts for a heartbreaking study of passionate love that deprived of proximity turn into confusion little lies on both sides then bigger lies and worst of all self-betrayal. ENLARGE Anton Yelchin and Felicity Jones in Like Crazy. Paramount Vantage ""Like Crazy"" was directed by Drake Doremus who wrote the script with Ben York Jones. Yet the written words arent necessarily the ones that come out of the actors mouths since most of the dialogue was improvised. I didnt realize that going in. I try to know as little as possible about a given film in advance of seeing it and this one undercut my conviction that actors improvisations lead more often than not to spontaneous banality. (My assumption about John Guleserians beautiful cinematography was similarly upset. I would have bet that hed shot on 35mm film. In fact he used the video function of a Canon EOS 7D a digital still camera that sells on the consumer market for about 1500 plus lenses and often travels on vacationers necks.) Ms. Jones and Mr. Yelchin are spontaneous all right. So too are Jennifer Lawrence as Jacobs fallback girlfriend (though I wish shed had a more substantial role) and Alex Kingston and Oliver Muirhead as Annas parents. But Anna and Jacob are also eloquent in their respective ways--Ms. Jones with her very English verbal fluency Mr. Yelchin with his very American syntactic vagueness--and all the more so in the silence of their expressions. Seldom has a script found such resonance in its lovers eyes body language and inward gazes. At one point in their relationship with Anna stuck in England while the U.S. Embassy reviews her case Jacob gives her a silver bracelet engraved with one word Patience. The same advice applies to moviegoers. ""Like Crazy"" develops slowly and threatens at first to be just another movie about beautiful young people in the Age of Fraught Relationships. Its much more than that though. Without belaboring any issues it speaks volumes about fear of commitment--Annas father offers the cheerfully old-fashioned suggestion that she and Jacob solve her visa problem by getting married--about inconstancy in any age about anxiety bred of mendacity about the dangers as well as the pleasures of impulsivity and the mystery of what if anything a pledge of love means. Patience pays off at least for us. Watch a film clip of director Chris Millers new animation movie ""Puss in Boots"" starring Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek. Clip Courtesy of DreamWorks. Puss in Boots Dont think of this charming 3-D animated feature as a spin-off from ""Shrek"" so much as a lift-off for the swashbuckling feline voiced by Antonio Banderas. Puss made his debut in ""Shrek 2"" then did time in the two decreasingly funny sequels. Now hes got a movie of his own and not a moment too soon. ""Puss in Boots"" exults in extravagant images while Mr. Banderas makes its hero--""Poos"" as his name is pronounced by most of the Spanish-accented characters--a paragon of sophisticated wit. You cant help but smile at his first Zorro-esque line accompanied by a guitar strum ""Through the years I have been known by many names."" And you sense a bright comic imagination at work when he bellies up to a bar orders milk and purrs ""I am but a humble gato looking for his next meal."" ENLARGE The titular feline swashbuckler in Puss in Boots. DreamWorks Animation A dramatic imagination is another story. The plot is little more than a string of collisions and events with a Tom-and-Jerry flavor that gets seriously diluted over the course of 90 minutes. Puss teams up with Humpty Dumpty (a creepily epicene ovoid voiced with eerie plaintiveness by Zach Galifianakis) to repay an old debt by stealing some magic beans from Jack and Jill. Along the way they climb a beanstalk that looks like a sky-scraping strand of DNA encounter a baby goose noticeably smaller than the golden eggs it lays a mother goose with the dimensions and disposition of King Kong and Kitty Softpaws a sexy cat burglar--that is to say a cat who burgles preferably by picking pockets-- played by Salma Hayek. When Puss and Kitty meet they throw themselves into a showstopper of a flamenco dance fight and do an equally effective reprise awhile later. But it isnt quite correct to say they stop the show which constantly functions in fits and starts--appealing set pieces inspired displays of animation (almost too much of too many brilliant things) and above all a performance by Mr. Banderas that defines the essence of droll. His voice is the gatos meow. Anonymous Watch a clip of Roland Emmerichs political thriller ""Anonymous"". Video courtesy of Sony/Columbia. Roland Emmerich has all but ended the world in such action spectaculars as ""Independence Day"" ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and ""2012."" In ""Anonymous"" he extinguishes literary scholarship by contending that Shakespeares plays were written by Edward de Vere Earl of Oxford. So all right then thats taken care of. Edward (played by Rhys Ifans) is the man we should have been honoring all along and Will Shakespeare an amiable buffoon as well as an indifferent actor took credit where it wasnt due. One problem with ""Anonymous"" though is what it says about the writers trade. Shakespeare--I mean Edward--is an unhappy man. ""The voices"" he cries. ""I cant stop them I would go mad if I didnt write down the voices."" He gets no sympathy from his wife. ""My God"" she says with disgust ""youre writing again."" And toward the end of his life he muses glumly ""Words merely words will be my sole legacy."" Didnt he even have fun writing his comedies? ENLARGE Rhys Ifans in Anonymous. Columbia Pictures A bigger problem with ""Anonymous"" is its opacity. The nonsensical notion of Edwards authorship is hardly more than a subplot. (He decided to hide it according to John Orloffs screenplay--which was actually written by whom?--out of fear that his plays were dangerously critical of powerful figures in Queen Elizabeths court.) Most of the movie is devoted to the Essex Rebellion against the queen and the action hops back and forth in time so befuddlingly with the same set of characters played by different actors that I defy anyone who isnt a scholar of the period to understand whats going on. (Which is not to suggest that I did.) Joely Richardson is engaging as the young queen but her mother Vanessa Redgrave is something else as Queen Bess in her powdered dotage. That something varies from moment to moment scene to scene. Sometimes shes distracted to the point of dottiness sometimes shes sharp as a tack and still seductive. In a movie that rings false at every turn Ms. Redgraves Elizabeth is truly and infallibly regal. In Time Andrew Niccols ""In Time"" looks great sounds stilted and plays like a clever videogame with too many rules. The premise builds on the notion that time is money. In the movies dystopian future where todays cars have tomorrows grilles time has replaced money. People are born with genetic clocks that stop at the age of 25; after that theyve got one year in which to beg borrow steal or even earn more time. If they dont the digital clocks embedded in their forearms dwindle down to zero and they time out i.e. die. Thats clever right? But then there are roving gangs called Minute Men (Teddy Boy types out of ""A Clockwork Orange"") who steal time; the borderline-silly spectacle of almost everyone looking 25; the polemic element of social injustice (the richest of the rich can live forever because theyve got eons socked away); and the action-adventure element a clumsy amalgam of Robin Hood ""Bonnie and Clyde"" ""The Avengers"" ""Les Miserables"" ""Dick Tracy"" (for the color and graphics) and Mr. Niccols earlier and impressive genetic-engineering opus ""Gattaca."" Amanda Seyfried and Justin Timberlake are the Bonnie and Clyde stand-ins though Ms. Seyfrieds makeup and wig suggest Anna Karina in an old Godard film. Its hard to judge their performances since they were clearly encouraged to be as stylized as the photography and sets by a director who given the evidence on screen came up short in the department of humor and was tone deaf to their American accents. (The English Minute Men sound fine.) It couldnt be easier on the other hand to judge Roger Deakinss cinematography Alex McDowells production design or Colleen Atwoods costumes; theyre all top-notch. Still one question lingers. In a film shot in and around Los Angeles why do all the car chases through all of the fictional regions time zones look like they were staged on the same venerable bridge across the Los Angeles River? ENLARGE Charlie Bartlett (2007) Charlie is a precocious young high-school student who both pops and pushes pills and Anton Yelchin plays him as a rich overmedicated Candide. The kids stash of the stuff is so copious thanks to an indulgent psychiatrist that he starts sharing it with his schoolmates and dispensing therapy along with the pills in the boys room. The cast includes Hope Davis at her best as Charlies libidinous mother Robert Downey Jr. as the schools bibulous principal and Kat Dennings as his daughter. Jon Poll directed from a script by Gustin Nash. The cinematographer was the estimable Paul Sarossy. Shakespeare in Love (1998) The Earl of Oxford may have written this too but Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard got screen credit for what is by unanimous agreement among Shakespearean scholars a totally fictional account of how a Bard with writers block sought help from a shrink (who timed patients sessions with an hourglass) and churned out ""Romeo and Juliet"" only after discovering his muse in a dishy brainy aristocrat named Lady Viola. Joseph Fiennes is Will Gwyneth Paltrow is Viola Geoffrey Rush is Philip Henslowe Shakespeares frantic gap-toothed producer and Judi Dench is the formidable Queen Elizabeth. The director was John Madden. Letters to Juliet (2010) Im not in love with this confection but I couldnt resist its intersections with ""Anonymous"" and ""In Time"" too. Amanda Seyfrieds Sophie a New Yorker magazine fact-checker goes to Verona to join volunteers who answer a ceaseless stream of letters addressed to Juliet. (The letter part is true.) She uncovers one written by an ardent English girl who is now a septuagenarian played by Vanessa Redgrave. And played so wonderfully well that watching her in action is like sitting in on a master class. Gary Winick directed from a cloying script by Jose Rivera and Tim Sullivan.

Between chases however his story droops.  |  1/2 out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune October 27 2011 -- 341pm Paramount Pictures AP ""Puss in Boots"" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Having run its sequel potential into the ground with three increasingly inert follow-ups the ""Shrek"" franchise makes another box-office grab via his comrade Puss in Boots. Fronting a new character offered the filmmakers a chance to reinvent and revitalize. Instead they coughed up this halfhearted hairball. Remember that toy where you yank a string and hear the sound of a barnyard animal? ""Puss in Boots"" has about half as much entertainment value. Antonio Banderas returns as the voice of the feline Zorro in a tale thats a combo platter of spinoff adventure yarn and origin story. The action is set in an antique Spanish never-never land where humans and fairy tale characters coexist. We learn that the cat and Humpty Dumpty grew up in the same orphanage bonding and then breaking up when Dumpty tricked Boots into a bungled bank robbery setting him on his career as a daredevil outlaw. Now Humpty hopes to reconcile with Puss and pursue the treasure at the top of the beanstalk. With his big oval baby face and innocent voice (provided by Zach Galifianakis) Humpty appears soft but hes ruthlessly hard-boiled when he chooses to be. Salma Hayek plays Kitty Softpaws a slinky cat burglar who joins the scheme to steal the magic beans from Jack and Jill (Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris). Presented in widescreen 3-D ""Puss in Boots"" is long on visual busyness but short on zaniness. The scripts verbal wit is nil with racing chasing spectacle in place of well-crafted gags. The most impressive moment is a breathtakingly fluid flamenco-dance duel between Puss and Kitty choreographed by Laura Gorenstein Miller artistic director of the L.A.-based Helios Dance Theatre and wife of the films director Chris Miller (""Shrek the Third""). Unfortunately that passage comes too early in the film and nothing that follows can match it. Instead the film commits the ""Indiana Jones 4"" blunder of staging frantic scenes of pursuit whenever the story sags which is often. The best joke -- the swashbuckling tomcat going all saucer-eyed and vulnerable to disable his enemies -- is on its third go-round by now. You go expecting catnip. You wind up with kitty litter. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

(Handout) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday October 27 2011 406 PM Title Puss in Boots The ""Shrek"" sidekick gets an animated origins story. With voicework from Antonio Banderas Salma Hayek Zach Galifianakis. Director Chris Miller (130). PG violence crude humor. At area theaters. The best part of the last two ""Shrek"" movies was Antonio Banderas sly Puss a feline charmer whose outsized self-image made up for his modest stature. But history is littered with the memory of unsuccessful spinoffs. Can one small kitty carry an entire movie? You bet your boots. Taking his task seriously but employing a light touch director Chris Miller brings us back to Pusss roots. Abandoned as a kitten he wound up in an orphanage with the emotionally cracked Humpty Dumpty (voiced by Zach Galifianakis). Together they planned minor high jinks until Humpty graduated to the big time with a scheme that landed Puss in jail. Years later these former friends reunite over one of Humptys new schemes to steal magic beans from Jack (Billy Bob Thornton) and Jill (Amy Sedaris). Puss is hesitant but Humptys gorgeous partner Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) proves impossible to resist. Theres nothing more dispiriting than a cynical kid flick that trades in obvious jokes and cheap pop culture references (that includes ""Shrek the Third"" which Miller also directed and now seems to be atoning for). ""Puss in Boots"" rejects such an easy path instead offering clever twists on classic tales witty visual treats -- though feel free to skip the expensive 3D ticket -- and spirited performances led by the enormously appealing Banderas. Dont ignore the PG rating This spaghetti western which was executive-produced by Guillermo del Toro is too saucy for truly young tots. Nevertheless its always a pleasure to find a family film that respects its audience all the way up the line. While kids will have a blast its the adults -- especially those who sat through all four ""Shreks"" -- wholl wind up happy as a cat in cream. Magic moment An adorably intense dance fight in the Glitter Box nightclub.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Just as the 3-D revolution is sailing over the edge of the cliff to overpriced under-produced ruin here comes ""Puss in Boots. I dont know if it will be enough to save the technology - Im not sure I want it to - but man does this thing look good. The landscapes in DreamWorks latest computer-animated return to Fairy Tale-land have a richness of detail and an illusion of depth that makes every other 3-D job this year (yes you too ""Lion King) look like cut-and-paste hackwork. The action and theres a lot of it flows consistently and cleanly. The heros best frenemy is an egg and a more bulbously tactile egg youll never see. Visually ""Puss is close to rapture.What? Is the movie itself any good? For a spinoff of a series (""Shrek) that has been pounded into the pavement surprisingly so. ""Puss in Boots doesnt break any new ground in the storytelling department and its reliance on go-go-go state-of-the-art action sequences grows wearying by the end but the movie has a devilish wit that works for parent and child alike and it moves like a bobsled. Its funny and fun and if its not up to Pixar level it still represents the best of what the competition has to offer.And it has Antonio Banderas who gives a more full-bodied performance with his voice than most actors do with their entire instrument. Banderas also arrives in the Boston area today as the star of Pedro Almodovars blissfully florid kinkathon ""The Skin I Live In and for the continued mental health of your children please dont get these two mixed up. ""Puss in Boots is the movie about the sword-wielding cat who joins up with a talking egg to rob a giant castle in the sky. You know the normal one.Directed by Chris Miller (who helmed the unfortunate ""Shrek the Third) and scripted by a small crowd of writers ""Puss is a razzle-dazzle 3-D ride thats at its best when the ride slows to a halt and the characters get to lob zingers at each other. The film mixes a little bit of Hitchcocks ""To Catch a Thief with a lot of ""Zorro the title character swashbuckling his outlaw way toward the legendary magic beans of ""Jack and the Beanstalk fame. He comes up against a sultry cat burglar named Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) who turns out to be in the employ of Humpty Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis) an ambitious and possibly crazed bad egg with a longstanding grudge against our hero.The lengthy extremely funny flashback in which Puss narrates his life story is an example of what DreamWorks Animation does best cleverly sardonic character comedy that when it clicks approaches the rarefied realm of a classic Warner Brothers Looney Tunes. The DreamWorks movies dont have soul - thats Pixars job - but they do have inventiveness and craft and a dedication to entertaining thats gratifying in an age of cookie-cutter family fare. And theyre open to the inspired whim like a flamenco dance fight that comes out of nowhere and briefly lifts ""Puss in Boots to deliriously silly levels of nonsense.More than Pixar though DreamWorks bows low to the marketplace demand that a modern CGI kiddie film be fast noisy and big. Miller and his minions know they have a 3-D IMAX screen to fill so many of the scenes devolve into roller-coaster rides at times almost literally. The heroes have to steal the magic beans from Jack and Jill who are not the cute kids from the nursery rhyme but hulking ogres with domestic issues - Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris have fun with the voices - and after a while one can-you-top-this? chase scene just follows another. If you have a Six Flags discount card you may want to bring it along.These sequences are hardly boring but they are surprisingly ordinary - the expected high-tech hyper-stim all modern children now consider their due. They dont stick to your ribs the way the films smaller more playful bits of business do the spaghetti-western split screens that comment wryly on the action or the way Banderas can get a laugh simply through the top-spin he puts on a line like ""Do not joke with me about magic beans. The star is the most special special effect in ""Puss in Boots for all the visual wow the studio has packed into the film. And you dont need the fancy glasses to appreciate him.

That said building an entire animated feature around him turns out to be a bit like making a Marx Brothers movie with just Chico. In the Shrek films the joke of Puss in Boots with his trilled consonants and penchant for chest-puffing sword duels is that no one this cuddly should try to be this dashing. But in Puss in Boots that joke wears out its welcome in 15 minutes. Were left with the feeling that Puss in Boots as a character has exactly one dimension self-deluded Spanish-macho vainglory. Hes like a lost mascot from a taco commercial. The movie gives Puss a sidekick the cracked-fairy-tale figure of Humpty Dumpty (voiced by Zach Galifianakis) who was once his comrade and then betrayed him. When the movie plunges into the convoluted backstory of these two only to emerge from the flashback about 20 minutes later we begin to realize The more stuff that happens in Puss in Boots the less stake we have in it. The movie throws in Jack and Jill (who are corpulent grown-up grouches) magic beans and a beanstalk a girl kitty (Salma Hayek) dressed for some reason as Catwoman and a whole lot more. Puss in Boots is beautifully animated (with 3-D that adds nothing) but the film is so mindlessly busy that it seems to be trying to distract you from the likable one-note feline swashbuckler at its center.

(AP Photo/Paramount Pictures) HOEP In this image released by Paramount Pictures Puss in Boots voiced by Antonio Banderas is shown in a scene from ""Puss in Boots."" (AP Photo/Paramount Pictures) St. Louisan T.S. Eliot wrote that cats should have three names an everyday name that humans give them (like Boots); a fancy name for special occasions (like Sir Boots-a-Lot); and a secret name that the cats give themselves (like He Whose Boots Stalk the Night). In the entertaining animated spin-off ""Puss in Boots"" the big-eyed tabby cat from the ""Shrek"" movies has a secret name that is a feline hybrid of Lover Bandit and Hero.This flick serves as a prequel to the fractured fairy tale of ""Shrek"" but the setting and tone are noticeably different. ""Puss in Boots"" is set in a place resembling Spain and the jokes are allusions to nursery rhymes and spaghetti Westerns rather than fairy tales and Hollywood melodramas.Puss (purr-fectly voiced by Antonio Banderas) is a pint-size swashbuckler who loves leche and lady cats. At a cantina where he is sipping milk the tiny tomcat learns that some legendary magic beans are in the grip of pig farmers Jack and Jill (Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris). When Puss tries to burgle the beans he brushes against competitor Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek). After a getaway and a dazzling dance-floor flirtation Kitty lures Puss into a hair-brained adventure involving bad egg Humpty Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis). Humpty was a childhood chum to Puss when they were orphans and he wants to make amends for a long-ago betrayal by leading him to the goose that lays golden eggs.""Puss in Boots"" doesnt have the psychological richness of the best ""Shrek"" movies -- or the show-biz slickness of the worst ones. Its colors like its jokes are more muted even while the 3-D stands out from the recent rash of retrofitted rip-offs. And there are clever flourishes in Chris Millers direction including split-screen imagery that would tickle Quentin Tarantino and sun-baked vistas reminiscent of ""Rango."" Even if they dont provide much lift these boots were made for amusement.

It feels like the camera is always in motion zooming up the strings of a guitar whizzing across a desert plain or ducking behind a characters head to adopt a dramatic visual perspective. The CGI film has a great sense of depth and detail in its spaces and it explores its world with bold dynamism. Viewers get to feel like daredevil hummingbirds darting from one plane of action to the next with reckless abandon sussing out complicated beautiful environments and diving in headfirst. If only a similar depth were reflected in the plot or characters. Even for a Shrek spin-off Puss In Boots is mighty thin gruel based more in outsized emotion than actual narrative. What plot there is centers on the eponymous fairy-tale cat burglars attempts to steal some magic beans from Jack and Jill (a pair of thick-set frowny villains voiced by Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris) for reasons that make little sense at least until he teams up with his bean-obsessed estranged childhood friend Humpty Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis) and gold-loving criminal minion Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek). Theres a great deal of posturing and drama among all of them both in flashbacks and in the present day but none of it amounts to more than a handful of excuses for flashy setpieces where Puss and Kitty face off in a dance fight or confront Jack and Jill atop a racing boar-drawn cart or the three protagonists zip skyward on a rapidly growing beanstalk. Granted the Shrek series has seen worse. Puss In Boots gets much of its mediocre comedy from kitty reaction shots and absurd juxtapositions of Puss tough-guy persona and his feline nature (as when he breaks character to lap up milk chase a moving light source or lick his privates). But it doesnt rely on Shrek-esque referential comedy or meta-humor and it largely steers clear of cheap shots and gross-out gags. The drama half of the equation is more difficult given that it comes largely from Banderas and Hayeks exaggerated Latin-lover personas and a series of betrayals and reversals so abrupt and half-assed the script doesnt even try to make them stick. Nonetheless the characters react to every unsurprising turn as if they were dealing with earth-shattering shocks; its opera-sized emotion in reaction to kazoo music. As a sheer visual experience Puss In Boots makes a great theme-park ride a thrill-a-minute feast for the eyes and the semicircular canals. But while the settings are impressively multidimensional the characters are flatter than old-school cel drawings.
