With wicked glee Texas director Robert Rodriguez piles on and piles on his frenetic hodgepodge of imagery often dazzling yet hurled so fast and thick the result is the cinematic equivalent of being hit by a bus. This two-hour bullet-train of a picture is packed with images startling in their originality and action that frequently flirts with utter odiousness. The movie is a masterful technical achievement with the emotional underpinning of a stunted male adolescent. Adapted from Frank Millers noirish comics ""Sin City"" is a movie where men are men and women are target practice there for the slapping and stabbing and shooting and any other indignities their male masters dream up. In a traditional full-color film the gore of ""Sin City"" would make the movie unwatchable. Presenting it in stark black-and-white with occasional splashes of color makes the movies blood and guts palatable though only barely so in its most extreme moments. The Jekyll-and-Hyde filmmaker (Rodriguez also is the man behind the ""Spy Kids"" family flicks) takes the carnage even beyond that of his blood-soaked vampire tale ""From Dusk Till Dawn."" With a huge well-chosen cast and the blessing of Miller who was on set as Rodriguezs co-director ""Sin City"" is a gloriously stylized world unlike anything youve seen before on screen. As he did with much of ""Spy Kids 3-D Game Over"" Rodriguez shot the actors against green-screen backgrounds using computer-generated visual effects to add the jutting buildings seedy alleys and other bleak backdrops of Millers Sin City. The filmmakers spin three tales of corruption and violence the stories and some of the characters loose-ly interconnected so the trilogy flows seamlessly without the abrupt transitions of most anthology movies. The most engaging story is that of the hulking not-so-gentle giant Marv played by Mickey Rourke unrecognizable behind makeup that makes his face resemble a carved cinderblock. After an unaccustomed night of sexual bliss with the beautiful prostitute Goldie (Jaime King) Marv wakes to find her dead and goes on a vengeful rampage to identify her killer. The one honest cop in Sin City John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) is at the center of another hunt as he scrambles to save an 11-year-old girl from a sexual predator (Nick Stahl). Hartigans story picks up eight years later as he again encounters Nancy (Jessica Alba) now an exotic dancer and is reacquainted with her tormentor who has mutated through medical treat-ment into a glowing fiend known as Yellow Bastard. The hero of the third story is ex-photographer Dwight (Clive Owen) a pal to the prostitutes of Sin City who tries to help them cover up the death of a vicious crooked cop (Benicio Del Toro). Among the roster of other key Sin City denizens Gail (Rosario Dawson) the iron-fisted leader of the towns prostitutes; Miho (Devon Aoki) her deadly samurai ally; the cannibalistic killer Kevin (Elijah Wood in a role as far from his heroic Frodo Baggins as imaginable); Bob (Michael Madsen) Hartigans turncoat partner; Shellie the waitress (Brittany Murphy); Marvs nursemaid Lucille (Carla Gugino the ""Spy Kids"" mom who tosses aside family-film values with an amazing nude scene); Sen. Roarke (Powers Boothe) Yellow Bastards plotting father; street-wise young hooker Becky (Alexis Bledel); Manute (Michael Clarke Duncan) a mountainous mob enforcer; and Josh Hartnett as a seductive hit man. Rodriguez pal Quentin Tarantino spent a day as ""guest director"" overseeing a perversely funny scene in which Owen and Del Toro drive through the rain. ""Sin City"" is meant as good gory fun an homage to the manly men and brazen broads of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett. Yet the sexism of ""Sin City"" often slips into miso-gyny. What may work as pulp entertainment on a comic-book page read in privacy becomes unsettling when played out graphically on a movie screen as an orgy of violence against women. ""Sin City"" is rated R for sustained strong stylized violence nudity and sexual content including dialogue. Running time 124 minutes.

Oh and disembodiment of a special kind the result of a digital production process that keeps actors separate from their backgrounds and one another so they cant interact. With a few welcome exceptions the acting is the only element thats bloodless. ""Sin City"" has been taken from the celebrated graphic novel series by Frank Miller. The directorial credit is shared by Mr. Miller and Robert Rodriguez a specialist in stylized violence whose previous films include ""From Dusk to Dawn."" (To give his creative partner his due Mr. Rodriguez had to resign from the Directors Guild of America which doesnt allow shared credits.) The movie is clearly a labor of love. Mr. Rodriguezs stated intention was to translate the novels to the screen as literally as possible and he achieved his goal with black-and-white images judicious use of color (mostly blood-red) and bold expressionist designs that can be stunning when they arent oppressive to the point of suffocation. But many follies are committed in the name of love and this is one of them. If theres a single scene that epitomizes the sensation that overtook me slowly but inexorably its the one in which Clive Owens character an ex-photo-journalist named Dwight sinks slowly into a tar pit. The script -- or the pitilessly repetitive cut-and-paste pastiche that passes for a script -- combines several Frank Miller stories about three down-and-dirty Galahads who risk everything to redeem besmirched women. Of the three Dwight is the sketchiest but theres nothing sketchy about Hartigan the over-the-hill cop played by Bruce Willis -- star power has its place even in a digital universe -- or about Marv the battered thug held together by countless Band-Aids whos played by Mickey Rourke. Mr. Rourkes performance is quite phenomenal a case of unquenchable talent bursting the bonds of dehumanized artifice. If youre a fan of the source material or the genre youll probably want to see the film if only for the force of its imagery. Still know what youre letting yourself in for. While ""Sin City"" on screen evokes the same feeling of bottomless decadence and dread that the novels do there is one crucial difference -- you can put the novels down. Look at Me ""Look at Me"" is the latest in a series of stiletto-sharp social comedies by the French filmmakers Jean-Pierre Bacri and Agnes Jaoui who are husband and wife. This time as in ""The Taste of Others"" she directs from their script and plays a secondary though significant part. He plays the lead a celebrated writer named Etienne Cassard. The nominal lead is Etiennes 20-year-old daughter the overweight and underloved Lolita (a fine performance by Marilou Berry) but the father takes center stage wherever he goes. Hes a bully a purblind peacock and to mix species as well as metaphors an emotional vampire who dominates poor Lolita and everyone around him. The contrast between father and daughter comes clear in the opening sequence. Lolita trying to talk on a cellphone in the back of a cab cant bring herself to insist that the cabbie turn down his radio which is deafening. When the cab stops to pick up her father and his beautiful girlfriend who is Lolitas age Etienne gives the belligerent cabbie such a tongue-lashing that the man falls into a silence thats certainly stunned and possibly admiring. Its the issue of admiration that makes the movie more -- much more -- than another story of a child trying to break free from a powerful parent. ""Look At Me"" in French with English subtitles wants us to see not only how personal power can be misused by those who have it but how readily even eagerly we surrender our power to those we admire envy or fear. Jean-Pierre Bacri is a powerful actor so its fascinating and even funny for a while to watch Etienne in action. As a conversationalist hes a harpoonist; every remark has a barb the sharpest being reserved for comments about Lolitas weight. As a listener hes deaf to anything that doesnt offer the sort of flattery he needs desperately since his seemingly vast ego conceals a shriveled sense of himself as a victim and a fraud. Yet Etiennes celebrity makes him the cynosure of all eyes and chattering mouths. His daughter talks about him incessantly even though like an inner planet shes being burned to a cinder by his gassy stardom. His assistant fawns on him. Another writer feels like a failure until he joins Etiennes circle. And Etiennes toxic power works by proxy. Lolitas singing teacher played by Ms. Jaoui is unimpressed by her students vocal powers until she discovers who her father is. If ""Look At Me"" is unsparing in its view of the father -- hes the very model of the narcissistic parent described by Alice Miller in ""The Drama of the Gifted Child"" -- its entirely unsentimental about the daughter. Shes a damaged child to be sure but also a self-pitying coward with a lot to learn from a forthright young man Sebastien who would love her if shed let him. How much she learns and how fast is the essence of her drama.    DVD TIP The long wait is over for those of us who think ""The Band Wagon"" is one of the two greatest American movie musicals ever made and maybe the greatest. (The other of course is ""Singin in the Rain."") Until now ""The Band Wagon"" has been unavailable on DVD; the closest you could come to seeing it in its full Technicolor glory was on a laserdisc which still fell short in clarity. But Warner Home Video has made everything right with a two-disc special edition available separately or as part of a five-title box set thats a signal event for film lovers. ""The Band Wagon"" was directed by Vincente Minnelli from a brilliant screenplay by Betty Comden and Adolph Green with a cast that included Fred Astaire Cyd Charisse Oscar Levant Nanette Fabray and Jack Buchanan. Released in 1953 when TV was already challenging the primacy of feature films it was a backstage musical about a has-been Hollywood hoofer played by Astaire who does a Broadway musical that turns out to be a pretentious hilarious flop. But Astaire and company save the day by creating a new show thats a hit and how could it not be given its string of drop-dead-glorious production numbers and a score by Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz that includes ""Dancing in the Dark"" ""By Myself"" ""A Shine on Your Shoes"" ""Triplets"" and ""Thats Entertainment"" The DVD provides another (optional) layer of pleasure -- a commentary track by Liza Minnelli and her friend the singer-musicologist Michael Feinstein that justifies a second viewing of the disc with the track switched on. Mr. Feinsteins remarks are eloquent and informative. Ms. Minnelli is still a fan incurably smitten with the wonder of show business and full of marvelous stories gleaned from watching her peerless father shoot the film at MGM. Theres a breathtaking moment at the beginning of ""Dancing in the Dark"" when Charisse strolling slowly through Central Park with Astaire takes a first tentative dance step as if possessed. The moment is only enhanced by Liza Minnellis comments ""Watch this Michael look Im sorry to interrupt you but I get so excited Watch this first step... here we go... its just like theyre...thinking. They happen to be thinking in tune with each other."" Thinking in tune with each other is an apt characterization of the musical form which brings us to the other four titles in the new set ""Easter Parade"" in which Astaire dances the classic number ""A Couple of Swells"" with Lizas mother Judy Garland; ""Brigadoon"" with Charisse Gene Kelly and Van Johnson; ""Finians Rainbow"" in which an aging Astaire was directed by the young Francis Ford Coppola; and another Vincente Minnelli musical ""Bells Are Ringing"" starring Judy Holliday in her last performance as an answering-service operator who eavesdrops on her clients. The great days of the movie musical are long gone but youd never know it from this box of vibrant DVDs. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com.

Comments Sin City Recommended Frank Millers series of black-and-white neonoir comics hits the screen in a stylish explosion of sadistic violence shot in crisp black and white but with novel use of spot color. Director Robert Rodriguez used the comics as storyboards and enlisted Miller as codirector and their vision of a late 40s urban hellhole with dramatic angles and constant voice-over is remarkably faithful to the original idiom--some scenes are even rendered in reverse silhouette with white bodies moving against black backgrounds. The story has been stitched together from several of the books which makes for a shapeless and nihilistic succession of superviolent set pieces. But the A-list of hard-boiled actors--Bruce Willis Clive Owen Benicio Del Toro Michael Clarke Duncan Michael Madsen and Mickey Rourke wearing a hatchet-face prosthesis--and Rodriguezs evident delight in the form make this a worthwhile piece of eye candy.

While its two-fisted vendettas wont pop everyones cork theres no denying Sin Citys technical achievement adapted with astonishing fidelity from Frank Millers characteristically smart-macho graphic novels the movie marks a new watershed in CGI film-making its green-screen performances and digitally rendered environments slickly meshed to yield the sort of aesthetic cohesion and expressive interiority so palpably lacking in the equally stylised Lucasverse. The Pulp Fiction-style structure offers three peripherally interlocking tales Mickey Rourkes conscientious brute investigates the slaying of tart-with-a-heart Jaime King; upright Clive Owen takes on slimy Benicio del Toro with the help of an army of Valkyrie-whores; and bookending these Bruce Williss cop Hartigan defends a young girl (who grows into Jessica Alba) from the psycho son of a senator (Nick Stahls sickly Yellow Bastard). Stand-out here is Rourke bringing weary wry resolve to a prosthetically sculpted increasingly bandaged face that comes to resemble a granite cliff that a flock of gulls has smacked into. But the stories are variations on the same righteously paternalistic revenge narrative and by the end of Hartigans tale (the most ethically queasy) the sadistic vigilantism and stock characters - including a notably crass Irish paramilitary - have relentlessly pummelled their points home. (Even Rodriguez credit reads shot and cut rather than photographed and edited.) Still the look of it remains exceptional a high-contrast monochrome showcase of sheeting rain shattering glass and white-on-black silhouettes with occasional motifs picked out in vivid colour - a red dress here green eyes there. Most striking is the single instance of flesh-coloured flesh; a too-rare flicker of human feeling.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

"Darkest Noir washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Darkest Noir Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 1 2005 ""Sin City"" is a dessert from hell an intense reduction of certain urban pop culture traditions into a creme brulee of brilliant artificiality. It takes the stylings of the spontaneous and gripping film noir moviemaking of the 40s -- shadowy streets neon spangles dramatic compositions extreme states of being -- and melts them down to scabrous gooey essence. And although its true the movie may remind you of someone channeling Raymond Chandler while gargling Wild Turkey its also true that as an icon of high decadence and high craft its in a different universe. Its pure outlaw art -- ""Kill Bill"" would be another outlaw masterpiece as would ""The Wild Bunch"" though neither is so formally stylized. And it asks a tough question What does a work of art owe to morality? You could call this a pure product of the American death cult. It celebrates revenge of the most violent sort it features heroes who not merely kill but mutilate then torture to death their enemies its view of women is primeval (they be all gun-toting hos) it draws the energy of titillation from breathless examinations of the most profane human behavior (cannibalism child molestation rape ambush-murder) it values toughness above everything and damn its really good. So do you say This film is perverse and should be banned for it will fascinate all too many of the impressionable young with its aggressive nihilism? Or do you say Its so gorgeous and seductive and such a mesmerizing experience you just have to let it be what it is and not apply the laws of taste and society to it. Heres the answer and the one thing I know for a fact I have no idea. As the visionary director Robert Rodriguez -- sole proprietor of the ""Desperado"" and ""Spy Kids"" franchises -- has it replicating almost exactly the imagery of Frank Millers graphic novels ""Sin City"" and two of its sequels ""Sin City"" is a kind of film noir Oz looted and happily liberated from the time-space continium. Think of it as the place where Mickey Spillanes id went to die. The place abbreviated cynically from Basin City is easy to find. Its just up the road from Gotham and to the west of Zenith. Its in the state of Imagination located no place in time or space but everywhere a lonely man drinks hard at 2 a.m. while drawing sustenance from a glowing cancer stick where he hears the dogs wail and the wind howl feels the reassuring weight of the Colt in his shoulder rig and misses a dame who -- I mean once this stuff gets in your mind you cant get it out. The cars appear smuggled in from any Havana street corner running from the clunky old Model Ts to the sleekest reddest Ferraris though a turquoise 57 Chrysler -- you know the one with tail fins the size of the prow of the USS Alabama -- gets a lot of screen time. Guns? Retro .45s mostly like those John Dillinger favored including a few nice product placements for Springfield Armory of Geneva Ill. But also Uzis and Berettas and a Steyr AUG or two. The coats are all trenches the hats fedoras the cigs unfiltered the alleys dark and windy the colors chiaroscuro and now and then a gash of red or a slash of yellow screams out. As a film -- well its not really a ""film""; its more a high-tech digital construction -- its the logical next step in the computer-world movies weve been seeing lately -- ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" ""The Polar Express"" -- but unlike them its more than a looker; its got an actual story or two or three under all the art direction. But still What art production Its one of those jobs where the actors go to a little green room put on their costumes and makeup do their jobs and go home in a few days. That raw footage is somehow then inserted into a digitalized (okay people what does digitalized mean anyway?) completely fictitious but breathtakingly detailed universe where art design and lighting counts more than physics. Theres no there there only carefully manipulated (digitalized??) electrons. There may be 8 million stories in this city but Rodriguez has chosen to tell only one of them and a pretty good one even if he tells it three times. Its the one about the tough guy -- he may be a cop a thug or a killer -- who meets a frail and she touches his heart gives him something to believe in on this crummy ball of crud we call the planet Earth. But then something happens to her see so he goes all righteous with wrath and fury even at the cost of his own life fighting the sleaze and the corruption and the cesspool and the depravity and the slime and the muck and the goop and the darkness and the creeps and the scum and the IRS and the -- okay not the IRS. Rodriguez has taken three of Millers stories -- the original ""Sin City"" ""The Big Fat Kill"" and ""The Yellow Bastard"" -- and woven them into a tapestry as they more or less transpire over a single night in Sin Citys Old Towne section and down those mean streets three men who are not tarnished and afraid must go. Okay so theyre all pretty mean themselves. The hero of the first is the man-mountain Marv played by Mickey Rourke and a seven-pound nose apparently modeled after the profile of Pontiac the Indian on the car. Marv a three-time loser runs into a babe named Goldie (Jaime King) and has a night in paradise with her but wakes up the next morning to find Goldie dead and himself framed for it with the cops just outside the door. Hes got to figure out who did it and pay him back in pain. Marv isnt a detective; hes a hooligan. His idea of investigating is mostly handled with guns and fists and the trail leads to the top of Sin Citys power structure. Rutger Hauer plays the evil Cardinal Roark whose mentee Kevin (Elijah Wood) is a cannibalistic elf with the eyes of a fawn who eats womens bodies and hangs their heads up in his farm house. Marvs vengeance needless to say is abrupt terminal and flamboyant. The weakest of the three tales comes next an account of how ex-hit man Dwight (Brit Clive Owen) saves the girls of Old Towne -- the dame in charge is Rosario Dawson made up to look like seven feet of leather-bound hell on high heels (loved the Uzi) and dont even get me started on Devon Aoki or well be here all night -- after a bully they have eliminated turns out to be a cop. Think of Dwight as the guy with two red shoes and two .45s. He takes down Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) and his clowns but gets a swim in a tar pit for his troubles and uncovers a plot by Irish mercenaries to take over the demimonde for the powers that are. A lot of it turns on possession of Jackie Boys head (maybe someone is doing a joke along the lines of ""Bring me the head of Benicio Del Toro""). The story is too complicated and depends entirely too much on exposition of the political contexts. But the third piece -- its first act runs early in the film and it plays to conclusion at the end -- is the best. Here weary warrior and Sin Citys only honest cop John Hartigan (Bruce Willis with somebody elses scars and somebody elses crew cut) tries to save little Nancy Callahan from Junior (Nick Stahl) a perverted child-molesting sociopath who enjoys a get-out-of-jail-free lifestyle courtesy of his powerful father a senator (played by an unbilled Powers Boothe in high dementia). For his heroism Hartigan is rewarded with eight years in the slammer; when he gets out young Nancy has grown into a willowy dancer (Jessica Alba) and she is still being hunted by the sociopath who now specializes in molesting 19-year-old strippers. Hartigans on the case. Like Marv before him -- maybe too much like Marv before him -- he tracks his antagonist down to the same locale (the farm again; theres also a relationship between Cardinal Roark and the senator and in some sense Kevin and Junior are siblings) and takes his 9 pounds 13 ounces of flesh. Unfortunately before Hartigan can torture his way to justice he must be tortured himself on the way to injustice A long sadistic sequence at the end of a rope may disturb even the hardiest of soulless movie consumers of this kind of genius-level junk. There are no great bravura sequences in ""Sin City"" as there were in ""Kill Bill"" and ""The Wild Bunch"" no sustained explosions of kinetic lyricism. The imagery is sensational however Marv slithering out of his car as it sinks into the river that surrounds them Hartigan pulling a shiv from nowhere and giving someone a very bad day right in the fat gut Dwight sinking in black tar going down down down. Lets put it this way Two hours and six minutes has never seemed so much like two and six-tenths seconds. Its pure pulp metafiction. Sin City (126 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for extremely cruel and graphic (if stylized) violence.

Robert Rodriguezs guild-bolting collaboration with graphic artist Frank Miller is a Mickey Spillane fever dream with a gallery of tough customers doing nasty things to each other on a shimmering monochrome canvas. Lurid run the streets of ""Sin City"" as aggressively faithful a rendering of a comic book aesthetic as has been put on the bigscreen with live actors. Deeply and digitally noir with the occasional slash of bold color to highlight a dames golden hair or red lips and dress Robert Rodriguezs guild-bolting collaboration with graphic artist Frank Miller is a Mickey Spillane fever dream with a gallery of tough customers doing nasty things to each other on a shimmering monochrome canvas. For geeks action freaks and sensation-seeking teenage boys of all ages the price of admission will provide a one-way ticket to hard-boiled heaven generating potent theatrical B.O. and even stronger returns in the homescreen afterlife. Millers world of rough customers living on the wild side possesses a sordid allure which the directors dazzlingly deliver to the screen. While the pairs purist approach may fully realize the nature of the material it also unfortunately locks it into its own box as a live-action cartoon. An adaptation of three Miller books from the ""Sin City"" series he launched in 1991 pic is increasingly limited by its episodic nature repetitive motifs monolithic character types use of violence to substitute for drama lack of modulating humor and virtually identical gravely voices for all its male characters. The film also peaks early at the 50-minute point with the conclusion of its most arresting story in which Mickey Rourke makes a ferociously effective bigscreen comeback as a hulking part-man part-beast out to avenge the murder of the only woman who ever done him right. With muscleman Marv literally tearing apart Sin City (actually identified as Basin City on a road sign) Rodriguez and Miller achieve maximum energy in this story while also endowing it with sardonic humor and a touch of sweetness conspicuously lacking thereafter. Neatly setting its nightscape location and hard-bitten tone in a brief teaser featuring Josh Hartnett and Marley Shelton (sequence served as the acid test that induced Miller to give Rodriguez the go-ahead to use his material) film quickly dives into the struggle of veteran cop Hartigan (Bruce Willis looking every bit a great film star of old in black-and-white) to prevent a corrupt senators pedophile son (Nick Stahl) from raping a young girl. Narrative soon switches over to the night of pleasure strapping Marv (Rourke) takes with a hooker named Goldie (Jaime King) who next morning turns up dead in his bed. Marv whose lupine proboscis (wonderfully rendered by the makeup experts to meld convincingly with the actors features) has evidently put a sizeable dent in his social life goes on a rampage in search of the killer. After checking in with his parole officer luscious lesbian Lucille (""Spy Kids"" star Carla Gugino letting it all hang out) Marv invades a particularly nasty bar where a number of the characters who come to figure importantly in later action are first glimpsed. He blows away a priest in a confessional before continuing his quest to the farm of cannibalistic killer Kevin (Elijah Wood in radically anti-Frodo mode) who displays on a wall his collection of the beautiful heads of his victims. So ultra is the violence between the destruction machine known as Marv and the eerily calm Kevin that it becomes perversely funny. This partly stems from the insouciance with which Rourke tosses off his characterization of a man so tough and strong he just cant help himself. Even when strapped to the electric chair to meet a fate hed be the first to admit he deserves he faces his demise with such style you cant help but like the guy. The action remains mostly downtown in the next vignette which sees one of the citys last good men Dwight (Clive Owen in rugged BMW ad form) wrangling with berserk corrupt cop Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro his look significantly changed by a long sloping nose) over the affections of impudent waitress Shellie (Brittany Murphy). The mens conflict sets off a gang war that impinges on the neighborhoods collection of savagely sexy hookers notably their Number One Gail (Rosario Dawson) Dwights great love. Episode has its moments of grotesque humor -- the supposedly dead Jackie Boy continues to figure in the action with a pistol embedded in his forehead -- but the presence of quasi-recognizable human beings here emphasizes the absence of any real emotions or relationships. Dawson comes as close as any of the actresses to creating a memorable role but the episode reveals an overriding weakness in the material -- Millers lack of strongly individuated female characters. With the return of Willis cop character for the final half-hour the directors desire to dovetail the stories in ""Pulp Fiction"" mode becomes clear. But its a half-hearted uninspired gambit and despite Nick Stahls startling transformation from merely a nasty spoiled boy to a grotesque meanie named Yellow Bastard (a character who infests the black-and-white screen with his full appropriate color) Willis Hartigan by this time seems too routine a character to ignite great excitement compared with those who have come before. However rough they are around the edges Millers male protagonists are descendents of Raymond Chandlers Philip Marlowe as knights trying to rescue largely dubious damsels from the encroaching darkness. To be sure the combined Women of Sin City would make for a banner issue of any mens magazine and the prospect of Jessica Alba Devon Aoki Alexis Bledel Dawson Gugino King Murphy and Shelton in skimpy and slutty attire will assuredly raise the pulses of the target audience. On the other hand too much may be made of the prominently billed participation of Quentin Tarantino as ""special guest director."" His contribution amounts to one scene which took a day to shoot of Owens Dwight driving through a hard rain while dealing with the presumably dead Jackie Boy in the seat next to him. Its a good energetic scene but appropriately of a piece with the rest of the picture. While generously giving Miller top billing on the shared directors card (as well as a possessory credit before the title) and eschewing any mention of a screenwriter Rodriguez takes an amusingly unusual ""shot and cut by"" credit and he really shines here; his lensing using the digital high-definition Sony HFC-950 cameras sublimely synthesizes the influences of graphic novels and film noir. The way in which computer generated backgrounds closely evoke and yet improve upon the backdrops and studio sets of 60-year-old Hollywood pictures is an ongoing astonishment and the synthesis of story acting and technology is in all ways more satisfying than last years similar big-studio experiment ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow.""

Starring Mickey Rourke Bruce Willis Benicio Del Toro Jessica Alba and Brittany Murphy. Directed by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez. (R. 125 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Sin City"" is a film noir about a crime-filled city and the people who inhabit it but its also a movie unlike any other. The film uses a combination of live action performed by real actors and computer graphics to transform Frank Millers graphic novels into moving pictures. To remember ""Sin City"" hours later is to remember from a different part of the brain that remembers conventional movies. Its to remember a comic book come to life. Just technically speaking its a remarkable achievement. Robert Rodriguez and Miller (who shared directing duties) set out to do something different and have succeeded in creating a complete other world thats seamless and beautiful. Theyve not only mastered the technology but have used it with artistry. Most frames in ""Sin City"" are in black and white with splashes of vibrant color -- the red of a womans lipstick the sickly yellow of a eunuchs complexion. Sometimes a woman is entirely in color and the man is in black and white. In one shot a woman takes two steps toward the camera and turns from color to black and white as if stepping into shadows. All these moments have a psychological reverberation -- they say something paint a mood or instill a feeling. The performances are in keeping with the visuals big but controlled. They match the heightened world of the comic book without spoofing it or commenting on it. For Mickey Rourke ""Sin City"" is practically a homecoming. Heres an actor who has seemed a bit strange in any cinematic setting for at least 10 years. But in this comic book context of outsized villains and heroes everything grand-scale and skewed about Rourke as a screen presence becomes a virtue. Its not enough to say that Rourke is good in ""Sin City."" It really feels like he lives there. Related Stories Sin City a truly original derivative work Rourke stars in the longest of the loosely connected stories that make up the film. Wearing prosthetics that give him an overhanging brow and a jutting chin he plays Marv a big ugly bruiser who brings home a pretty girl named Goldie (Jaime King) and wakes up in the morning to find out that shes been killed. Realizing hes about to get framed he escapes and sets out to find her killer pounding smashing and slaughtering everything that gets in his way. Rourke is lots of fun -- confident and bizarre and with a strange imperviousness as though not occupying the same reality as everyone else. Marv is described at one point as a man out of some earlier more brutal century. Thats how Rourke plays him as an almost completely instinctive man. ""Sin City"" also provides an invigorating showcase for Bruce Willis as an old cop Hartigan who is to retire because of a heart condition. Of course his last case turns out to be his biggest one involving a child murderer (Nick Stahl) who also happens to be the son of a senator. ""Sin City"" could be criticized as old stuff. The noir world it presents is derivative of 1940s film and it bears a family resemblance to other postmodern fantasy noirs such as ""Dark City"" and ""The Crow."" Like film noir it can also be accused of misogyny. Women are slain with abandon -- though so are men -- and the one vision of female strength the movie offers is that of the prostitute. In one segment a fugitive (Clive Owen) and a thug (Benicio Del Toro) have a fight that spills over into ""Old Town"" a part of the city ruled by a merry prostitute band. The other female characters are pretty much victims of men Brittany Murphy plays a barmaid with a nice raunchy resiliency and Jessica Alba though she has trouble acting the role of a nightclub dancer looks great in black-and-white. Part of me wants to resist ""Sin City"" because its art based on art thats based on art -- that is a movie based on a comic book based on a film genre -- and like anything three stages removed from inspiration it has nothing to say. Its a style piece a fever dream about film noir and that hardly seems ambitious or important. Yet if the movies aims arent lofty its entertainment value is high and consistent. Virtually every moment of ""Sin City"" engages the mind and the eye. The energy never flags; the story never stalls. It starts in motion and ends in motion. To make a movie this entertaining is to accomplish a small miracle. -- Advisory Nudity extreme violence dismemberment sexual situations.

Even the acclaimed ""Spider-Man"" blockbusters owe more to director Sam Raimi than to comics creator Stan Lee. ""Frank Millers Sin City"" sets a new and higher standard. Robert Rodriguez recruited Frank Miller as co-director of this visually exacting translation of Millers ""Sin City"" graphic novels. Rodriguez sacrificed membership in the Directors Guild of America (which allows only established directorial teams like the Coen and Wachowski brothers) to ensure that Millers vision would remain meticulously intact. As a result Millers many fans are likely to hail this as a masterpiece. Rarely has an artist in one medium been so loyally served by another. A self-taught wizard with three ""Spy Kids"" hits to his credit Rodriguez turned his Austin Texas-based mini-studio into a digital conduit for Millers imagination. In this limitless realm physical laws of motion and gravity no longer apply and comics come to life. Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Frank Millers Sin City"" with Bruce Willis Mickey Rourke Benicio Del Toro Clive Owen Nick Stahl Rosario Dawson Elijah Wood Jessica Alba. Directed by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller from a screenplay by Rodriguez and Miller based on Millers ""Sin City"" graphic novels. 126 minutes. Rated R for graphic violence gore nudity mild profanity subject matter. Several theaters. The hard-boiled mostly black-and-white underworld of Millers pulp-fictional Basin City is occasionally punctuated by vivid jolts of color. Rodriguez and Miller honor the style and syntax of comics as gleaned from the mediums ongoing evolution Brutish thugs punch with sudden bone-shattering impact (you can almost read ""Ker-raccckkk"" on screen); blood spatters with artful precision; rain falls in horizontal streaks; cars careen exactly the way comic-book cars are supposed to. From racy costumes to elaborate Dick Tracy-style makeup design everything is intensely stylized and its all deliriously perfect. Rodriguez filmed a neo-noir prologue (featuring Josh Hartnett) to sell Miller on his directorial intentions. This led to a combination of three of Millers original stories (""The Hard Goodbye"" ""The Big Fat Kill"" and ""That Yellow Bastard"") in a raw ultra-violent anthology rooted in the legacies of Dashiell Hammett Raymond Chandler and Mickey Spillane. But old-school guns and scantily clad femmes fatale arent Millers only inspiration; severed heads martial arts and sociopathic cannibals also factor into his cynical rogues gallery of martyred antiheroes and unredeemable villains. Best of all is Marv (Mickey Rourke under perfectly chiseled latex) a nearly-invincible hulk who avenges the murder of an angelic prostitute in the films fastest funniest segment. His story is loosely connected to those of grizzled cop Hartigan (Bruce Willis) whos tracking a corrupt politician (Powers Boothe) and his mutated pedophile son (Nick Stahl) while searching for an exotic dancer (Jessica Alba) hed rescued years before and Dwight (Clive Owen) an ex-con who joins forces with the heavily armed hookers of Old Town (led by the breathtakingly lethal Rosario Dawson) when a delicate truce is violated by a wretched cop (Benicio Del Toro). The good guys are bad and the bad guys are utterly evil Elijah Wood Rutger Hauer Michael Clark Duncan and Michael Madsen inhabit vividly twisted roles that are variously scary hilarious and freakishly extreme. But then nothing in ""Sin City"" is subtle. The gonzo sensibility of ""Sin City"" -- including an Owen/Del Toro driving scene directed by Quentin Tarantino -- is self-assured and defiantly in-your-face. Parents of young eager ""Sin City"" fans be warned This is R-rated filmmaking on the raw cutting edge directly comparable to an M-rated video game. Thats no crime of course but while the all-star cast is in fine form Rodriguez and Miller are obviously catering to a juvenile mindset and theyre not entirely successful in weaving a satisfying yarn from three separate threads. ""Sin City"" is a triumph of technique thats likely to have a bludgeoning effect on anyone who prefers more potent emotional substance. If youre on the ""Sin City"" wavelength however youll get a jolt of exhilaration.

"The genius of Sin City. Slate Sign In Sign Up The genius of Sin City. The genius of Sin City. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.March 31 2005 307 PM Bloodsport The genius of Sin City. By David Edelstein Sinfully good movie As a film critic I have often bemoaned the amorality and opportunism of the vigilante genre as well as the sadism and righteous torture on display in movies and television in the wake of Sept. 11. From time to time I have also lamented the explosion of the comic-book superhero genre. With the recent exceptions of Spider-Man 2 and The Incredibles these cookie-cutter action thrillers have been crafted for a generation weaned on Game Boys. Meanwhile computerized effects have taken cinema farther and farther from the world that human beings actually inhabit. And now comes cinemas latest devolutionary milestone Sin City (Miramax) a graphic novel come to life its sets copied from the page and regenerated in three dimensions inside a computer and boasting the most relentless display of torture and sadism Ive encountered in a mainstream movie. My reaction to Sin City is easily stated. I loved it. Or to put it another way I loved it I loved it I loved it. I loved every gorgeous sick disgusting ravishing overbaked blood-spurting artificial frame of it. A tad hypocritical? Yes. But sometimes you think ""Well Ill just go to hell."" Advertisement The movie is co-directed by Frank Miller who created the Sin City graphic novels and Robert Rodriguez who gave up his membership in the Directors Guild of America when it told him he couldnt share a credit with someone whod never directed a film. (What a putz move by the DGA.) Rodriguezs inclusion of Miller in the process is admirable--not to mention canny. In his last film Once Upon a Time in Mexico the action was edited in a rhythmless bash-along style and despite the pictures A-list cast it ended up no better than a piece of direct-to-video junk. Frank Miller has given Robert Rodriguez a virtuosity transplant. The movie is something to see. Its a study in luminous black and white with sudden and breathtaking splashes of crimson chartreuse and a particularly nauseating mustard for a gargoyle-incubus psycho--one of several psychos by the way You can barely keep track of them all. Sin City consists of three stories (well four if you count a brief prologue and epilogue featuring Josh Hartnett). Each is narrated by a male protagonist in language more hard-boiled than a six-hour egg. And each makes a convincing case for mutilation dismemberment castration and various creative combinations thereof. Sin City (the place) is a typically Milleresque universe of predators--all dark alleys and oppressive corporate facades and pockets of ""Nighthawks"" illumination through which faceless denizens scuttle. In order to protect the people they love the chivalric good guys must sink to the level of the bad guys except the bad guys have sunk so low that you need the moral equivalent of an oil derrick to go any lower. Bruce Willis plays Hartigan an aging police detective whos hunting a serial killer of children--and tangling along the way with his clammy partner (Michael Madsen). Mickey Rourke is Marv a brutish and cynical barfly--Bukowski on steroids--determined to avenge the murder of a prostitute named Goldie (Jaime King) the closest thing to an angel in his disgusting life. Private eye Clive Owen runs afoul of an abusive misogynistic thug played by Benicio del Toro and both wind up in Old Town where the ""ladies are the law""--awesomely adept at martial arts and artillery and wearing battle-ready lingerie to boot. Advertisement What a cast Rosario Dawson as an urban Valkyrie; Jessica Alba as a stripper-ingenue with satin skin; Brittany Murphy whose big waif eyes leap out of the screen as a waitress. Powers Boothe Rutger Hauer Nick Stahl Elijah Wood Michael Clarke Duncan Carla Gugino Alexis Bledel with her perfect little heart-shaped face--this is B-picture heaven. But its Mickey Rourkes movie. Yes Mickeys back. Between bodybuilding and sundry forms of self-abuse he hasnt been the prettiest sight in the last decade. But as Marv he wears prosthetics that thicken his features and make his ugliness poetic and he has the big-lug powerhouse magnetism of Robert Mitchum. Marv is liberated by the prospect of revenge. He says ""Hell is waking up every goddamn day and not knowing why youre here""--and now he knows. He likes to take his time torturing the bad guys; he almost hates to finish them off. The final encounter between this blockish pugilistic slab of beef and Elijah Woods Kevin--a mute cannibal psycho geek with little glasses that white out his eyes and who fights like a weightless dervish--is a thrilling gravitational mismatch. Many of my colleagues think Sin City goes on way too long. Well if youre going to nitpick. OK it is odd to hear the ostentatiously fit Bruce Willis describe himself over and over as an old man with a bum ticker. And its probably overkill to have two separate characters go head first into a toilet--although I liked the curly stools in the first dunking and the bowls-eye-view in the second. As for the carnage its important to add that the blood isnt red. Its black or white or yellow--so you register the quantity but dont have that visceral blehhh reaction you get with most gut-bucket pictures. Sin City is just distanced enough to be an art object. One car-ride sequence directed by Rodriguezs pal Quentin Tarantino is a little jewel of camera movement lighting and design. The raindrops are white--its a painterly deluge. Sin City isnt quite as fascinating to look at as last years Deco museum Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow but its so much more kinetic and pulse-quickening. Rodriguez doesnt just transplant Millers frames. He celebrates even fetishizes them. The images seem dredged up from the collective unconscious of graphic-novel freaks. It seems pointless to tut-tut over the depravity. Sin City is like a must-have coffee-table book for your interior torture chamber.

(CNN) -- ""Sin City"" adapted from three hardboiled comic books by the renowned graphic novelist Frank Miller is without doubt the most visually stunning live action transfer of the comic book format to the big screen ever made.The stark black and white images -- with beautifully calculated splashes of vivid color -- are shockingly faithful to Millers lurid ultra-violent crime-riddled world. Its an alternative universe where almost everyone is a perpetrator a victim or a witness.Co-directed by Miller and Robert Rodriguez -- with a special guest director stint by Quentin Tarantino -- the film was shot entirely against green screens using the latest in high-definition cameras. Rodriguez and Miller have lifted the comic-book panels from page to screen. The result is an eye-popping visceral feast.The combination of these non-Hollywood mavericks also attracted a wide range of acting talent eager to populate this world of gun molls prostitutes crooked cops serial killers and guns-for-hire. Its Mickey Spillane on steroids.The film opens with a brief teaser featuring a doomed dame standing on a terrace high above the cold teeming city. Her flaming red dress is in high contrast to the black and white world she inhabits. In a cameo role Josh Hartnett enters the scene with the words ""She shivered in the wind like the last leaf on a dying tree."" He then simultaneously kisses and kills her. The stage and the tone is set.Then like a smack in the face the action charges into the first of three graphic novels ""That Yellow Bastard."" This story is cut in two thereby framing the films beginning and conclusion. Featuring Bruce Willis as Hartigan a good cop with a bad ticker its a tragic tale of the hunt for a raging pedophile named Roark Jr. (Nick Stahl). Hes the son of a corrupt senator (Powers Boothe) a man who is determined to protect his offspring at all cost.Toward the end of the movie -- when this storyline continues the son morphs into an arch villain -- the Yellow Bastard -- allowing for one of the films best uses of vibrant color. This vignette also features a sexually charged performance by Jessica Alba who plays Nancy an erotic dancer who as a child was one of Roarks victims.Mind-numbing repetition Jessica Alba and Bruce Willis in ""Sin City""The attention then switches to Millers ""The Hard Goodbye"" starring an unrecognizable Mickey Rourke as a half-man half-beast killing machine named Marv. Hes seeking revenge for the murder of a hooker named Goldie (Jaime King) who showed him the only touch of kindness he ever received. The search leads to Kevin a psycho-serial killer played by Elijah Wood in an obvious move to make everyone forget all about Frodo. This story is the core of ""Sin City"" and its the best of the three episodes.The final vignette -- ""The Big Fat Kill"" -- includes some major performances. Clive Owen is Dwight one of Sin Citys only good guys. Rosario Dawson plays Gail his ex-lover and the leader of a gang of Amazonian hookers. Benicio Del Toro does a great turn as Jackie Boy a ruthless corrupt cop. Brittany Murphy portrays Jackie Boys reluctant girlfriend Shellie. When Jackie Boy is murdered Dwight steps in and maintains the truce set up between the hookers of Old Town and the cops.Hard-core action junkies comic book geeks and the young male movie-going demographic will undoubtedly go wild over this over-the-top blood fest. However after ""The Hard Goodbye"" unfolds ""Sin City"" drifts toward committing the ""eighth deadly sin"" -- boredom.Due to the mind-numbing repetition of the same grotesque violence (dual beheadings numerous scenes of people being mowed down by automatic weapons and various faces being shoved into toilet bowls) plus the failure of a coherent weaving together of the three storylines this wildly innovative film bogs down in the third act. Just as in life in film looks arent always everything.Instead of thinking ""Whats next?"" you begin to think ""Didnt we just see this?"" The meticulous faithfulness to Millers work is the films greatest strength and its biggest weakness. As with many dark graphic novels of this type his stories are more focused on the visual than driven by the plot. But despite the lack of a strong narrative this film has to be hailed as a landmark. Not only did it succeed in pushing a film genre into virgin territory it may even have created a new one.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

Jessica Alba plays Nancy Callahan a stripper with a heart of gold in Sin City. Dimension Films But itll help if you are an enthusiast of comic-book fantasy and stylized sadism with a wink. Thats the target audience for this worst-of-all-date-movies. If not theres an army of scantily clad trollops whose equally stylized sordidness could seduce even E.T. Told in three parts with alas the best one first City has been lifted with perverse gusto from co-director Millers popular graphic novels. And like last falls Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (though this is a better film) it benefits more from the novelty of seeing actors imposed against imaginatively computerized backgrounds than any screenwriting to write home about. If you live in Sin City you know its the anti-Mayberry. Elijah Woods Kevin eats the bodies of women whose heads he then hangs on a wall (say it aint so Frodo). As Marv Mickey Rourkes face looks as if Dr. Frankensteins mad assistant assembled it from body parts. And Rourke in his best role in years plays one of the films good guys. About the movie Sin City    1/2 (out of four) Stars Bruce Willis Jessica Alba Mickey Rourke Clive Owen Brittany Murphy Benicio Del Toro Rosario Dawson Director Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez Distributor Dimension Rated R for sustained strong stylized violence nudity and sexual content including dialogue. Opens Friday nationwide Rourkes character dominates the first story and Bruce Willis is the focus of the third. Both are motivated by big-hearted babes gone and done wrong as is the midsections Clive Owen embroiled in a gang-war fracas over a waitress in a dive. This movie is full of males who belong in this genre Willis Rourke Benicio Del Toro Michael Madsen Rutger Hauer. Theres even Quentin Tarantino who does not appear but helped co-director Robert Rodriguez by directing one rainy scene. In artfully exaggerated noir fashion the women are unlikely to be found at a NOW mixer. Rosario Dawson dons what looks to be Victorias Secret bondage garb -- leaving few secrets. Jessica Alba is professionally naughty and Carla Gugino as a lesbian parole officer guarantees youll never watch her as Spy Kids mom the same way again. Occasionally very funny the picture tends to coast on its cosmetics. A first-rate script might have made it a twisted masterpiece not just a visual entrancer whose purposeful ugliness could probably be rendered only as a cartoon. Itll be interesting to see how time treats Citys novelty value once live action/computer screen hybrids become more common. Right now it looks like one of the movies that will define its year even more than the Kill Bill duo did. Kill Bill but loooove Carla.

Dames sure know how to talk that sweet talk. The blank screens laughing at me now ""Go ahead baby. Type that hard-boiled review of Sin City. Tell the people how darn cool it is."" Shuddup you heartless pane I tell it. Gotta stop talking to things. First sign of madness they say. Whoever ""they"" are. Come on pal. Youve done this before. If you cant make it sing spit it out anyway. Here goes ""Frank Millers Sin City"" is the hippest darkest flick Ive seen all year. Its not even April mind you. So that was easy to say. But you get the picture. A movie composed of three edge-of-your-seat sagas its co-directed by Miller (the cool cat who wrote the 1991 graphic novel series that rocked a generation) and Robert Rodriguez who made ""El Mariachi"" and ""From Dusk Till Dawn."" And Quentin Tarantino the official pimp daddy of indie-chic even gets to guest-direct. Tarantino incidentally does a scene in which Dwight a private investigator played by Clive Owen is stopped by cops at a very inconvenient moment. He happens to have his trunk loaded with severed body parts and his passenger is sitting dead in the front seat with an all-but-severed head. But we are getting ahead of ourselves. ""Sin City"" takes us to Basin City where corruption is the order of the day and daylight never seems to last too long. The cops are dirty the hookers are armed and empowered like gangstas and the tough guys are built like brick houses but they still get beat up anyway. Its those sleazy bars they go to. And those dames they get hooked on. In a tough world like this its easy to fall in love. Gives them something to believe in. Take Marv (Mickey Rourke) a sinewy fireplug of a guy. Laughs when cops or punks rip his face. Spits out blood nonchalantly when the cops give him the once-over. But melts like an ice pop in July when a goddess beauty (Jaime King) called Goldie drapes herself around him and takes him home. Marv wakes up to find her dead and spends the rest of his life looking for the killers who iced the love of his life. Then theres Dwight. With emotional ties to his prostitute pals he does everything he can to save them after the death of a group of cops threatens to provoke a brutal war between the call gals and the boys in blue. Thats where the hacked body parts come in. But Dwight does it for love. An unexpected romance proves to be the spiritual guiding light for John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) whos just about the only good cop in Sin City. After an 11-year-old girl is apprehended he risks everything to save her from a dirty cop (Michael Madsen) and a bizarre sadist (Nick Stahl) with connections in high places. These dramas of tough almost bionic guys and elusive slinky women are extreme versions of the underworld sensibility that has governed a billion crime novels and films noirs of the 1940s and 50s. Miller became a cult hero for such edgy comic book creations as Elektra (the ninja assassin) and Ronin (a hard-core samurai figure). But the ""Sin City"" series was his pulp fiction masterpiece. The idea of making a movie of ""Sin City"" would seem to be an instant disaster -- how could a film do justice to the gritty idiosyncrasies of his work? But with their translations of Millers ""The Hard Goodbye"" ""The Big Fat Kill"" and ""That Yellow Bastard"" Miller and Rodriguez have achieved the near-impossible reproducing the pictorial reality of those comic book stories onto the screen. Visually this has been done with digital enhancement darkly perfected sets and masterful makeup. The performers look part-cartoon and part-human and thoroughly convincing. But all the visual splendor in the world means nothing without effective performances. The list of memorables is long Rourke has found his greatest role since ""The Pope of Greenwich Village."" Willis is his usual authoritatively tough-and-tender self. Owen and Benicio Del Toro (as a menacingly jealous boyfriend named Jackie Boy) are outstanding. And Elijah Wood is so luminously creepy as the psychopathic Kevin youd swear he just sprang fully formed from an M. Night Shyamalan nightmare. And those are just the guys. The women are equally formidable including Jessica Alba as Hartigans icon dream girl; Rosario Dawson as an Uzi-packing hooker named Gail; Brittany Murphy as a savvy tenderhearted waitress who links all three stories; and Devon Aoki as Miho a deadly streetwalker who uses the same swords we enjoyed in Tarantinos ""Kill Bill"" movies. Yes ""Sin City"" is an orgy of cynical violence but its a winkingly surface grimness just like its B-movie/pulp novel ancestors. You simply appreciate this genre for what it is or you dont. Rodriguez and company have so faithfully captured Millers essence theres something beautiful about the whole thing. Its an act of inspired reverence. Whether or not the movie does well in its theatrical first run its a guaranteed must-see for its generation. ""Sin City"" has a long long shelf life ahead.

From there it moves smartly to the promise of child molestation and with the culprit having had both his face and his balls shot off by Bruce Willis steams merrily along toward cannibalism electrocution and the mounting of severed female heads on walls. Had enough? If not then you are in all likelihood an adult male aging ungracefully or a pimply youth with a pimply youths fondness for comic books about hell on Earth. If youre a woman of any age who gets off on this stuff even with its feeble stabs at feminist role reversals I throw up my hands. Still given the current vogue for empty aesthetics Im bracing for the laurels that middle-aged critics suffering from hipster anxiety will heap on this fusion of comic-book art Asian combat anime and digital cinema. Ill lay odds that Pauline Kael in her late period of indiscriminate pop worship would have gushed acres of heated prose in favor of Sin City. As for me after half an hour spent drooling over its visual splendors I found the movie every bit as sickening as its creators intended it to be minus the kicks they so palpably got out of making it. Billed as a collaborative work Sin City is directed by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez with some input from Quentin Tarantino -- a meeting of flamboyantly underage minds if ever there was. More accurately the movie is a labor of puppy love by Rodriguez whose work shuttles between enjoyably low-rent noir romanticism (El Mariachi) and childlike exuberance (Spy Kids) for the 1990s graphic novels that made Miller a star. Set in an urban wasteland -- populated by Amazonian hookers compromised cops and corrupt senators -- that lies somewhere between Hells Kitchen and the mangier back alleys of downtown Los Angeles the Sin City series set the tone for a born-again comic-book art set in the seething underbelly of cities where vice and virtue rub shoulders and trade places at the wrong end of a gun. More imitation than interpretation the film was ""cut and shot"" as the credits archly put it (God forbid Rodriguez should be doing anything as reactionary as editing or cinematography) on a green screen with state-of-the-art digital manipulation that essentially functions as a paste-up of Millers visceral drawings. The handsome production design is classic noir a shadowy world of silvery black and white stained with blood red and livid yellow to signify both beauty and deformity of body and spirit. As is so often the case with hardcore pulp the dialogue co-written by Miller and Rodriguez works better on the page than declaimed out loud which revs up the clipped meta-speech to the point of real silliness. Sin City brings together three of Millers tales in which ambiguous heroes festering in the same interstitial cracks of the city as their quarries take revenge as a means to redemption from their own failings. Unrecognizable under many pounds of makeup and Schwarzenegger musculature Mickey Rourke looks splendidly craggy as Marv a street-fighting loner who cruises the nighttime city hunting down the killers of a beautiful blond hooker he fell in love with because she was the first and only woman to drop him a kind word. Doing Bogart detail Clive Owen in floor-mop hair plays a private eye who tries to stay out of trouble (represented by a porked-out Benicio del Toro with a dagger stuck in his forehead in a sequence directed by Quentin Tarantino) while laboring to protect a leathered-up bevy of ladies of the evening who -- headed by Rosario Dawson in heavy bondage gear and Devon Aoki as a silent but deadly swordswoman -- turn out to need less protection than he does. In a valiant effort at moral complexity Sin City is bookended by the ailing washed-up cop Hartigan (Willis) who in his last hour of service saves an imperiled child whose destiny will haunt him to the end of his days. These three heroic abstractions (no one in his right mind could call them characters) coalesce into a gaga knightliness that only a virgin schoolboy could get behind. In the acting out of Millers timely if hardly original themes the hazy line between sin and virtue blurs into a furiously accelerating orgy of gore and severed limbs that could very well make Takashi Miike blanch -- that is the true manga-inspired impulse of this film. ""We were like three kids in a tree fort having a ball"" Miller has said about the making of Sin City and I believe him. The product of three adolescent imaginations with a Sam Fuller fixation brilliant mastery of the toys in their digital sandbox and next to no grasp of life Sin Citys moral dilemmas are bogus and engage no emotional response. Unlike the Spider-Man franchise the movie has no sense of fun beyond the filmmakers high-pitched giggles at the expense of audience stamina. Years ago before he grew famous Tarantino told me in an interview that his own enjoyment and the kick audiences got out of his brand of aestheticized violence were its only justification. I cant think of any other but his formula -- visceral stylish derivative and detached from all humanity -- has grown into a virus frantically copying itself all over the map of contemporary cinema. Given the burgeoning market for their work at home and abroad in all likelihood he and Rodriguez and their legion imitators will get better and better at what they do while having less and less to say. For those of us who like our movies to show or tell us something about the way we live thats both too much and not nearly enough.

"Sin City | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; sin-city ) Sin City (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Sin City is the most visually inventive comic book adaptation to make its way to a movie screen. While other directors have attempted to remain faithful to the look and ""feel"" of their source material Robert Rodriguez has taken things a step further by using Frank Millers graphic novels as storyboards and immersing the audience neck-deep in the noir currents of Millers den of iniquity. Its easy to get lost in Sin City. Theres something to appreciate around every corner - the gritty characters the uncompromising story and most of all visuals to astound and amaze. ""Eye candy"" doesnt even begin to describe what Rodriguez has accomplished. Black-and-white is the best format for film noir and Rodriguez recognizes that - not that anyone would mistake this picture with its kinetic energy and restless camera for a relic of the 40s or 50s. However what the director offers here is bamp;w with bells and whistles. Sin City is full of color flashes - the red of a dress or a womans lipstick the blue or green of someones eyes the blond of a hookers hair the orange of fire or the yellow of a lowlifes skin. Then theres the blood - and theres a lot of that. Blood is either represented as a florescent white or more frequently in its natural color. In fact it wouldnt be too much of a stretch to describe Sin City using the old cliche ""black and white and red all over."" With a movie of this ilk where the style trumps substance its easy to come up with something that engages the eyes more than the mind. Fortunately thats not the case here. Rodriguez and Miller give us a rogues gallery of memorable heroes and anti-heroes and make sure that all three of the films primary episodes are fast-paced and engaging. Theres a little of Pulp Fiction in Sin City both in the hipness and the sense of discovery. Pulp Fiction provided a bigger jolt but Sin City isnt far behind. Aside from the decision to shoot in black-and-white there are plenty of things to announce Sin City as modern-day noir. Theres a running voiceover narrative thats about a pulpy as one can imagine right to the frequent use of the word ""dames"" to describe women. (Sin City exists out of time in a world where elements of nearly every decade of the last century are represented in one way or another.) Ties and coats flap in the breeze with the latter billowing behind running men like bat wings. And nearly every cool character in the film drives a convertible (unless a ""flat-top"" is specifically requested) and smokes without concern about the health risks. (Of course for characters that get shot six or seven times then come back for more conventional medical issues dont pose much of a problem - although Hartigan has angina.) The movie attracted an impressive array of talent including some of the biggest up-and-coming names in Hollywood as well as a few established stars and one has-been on the comeback trail. A lesser movie with this kind of high-octane cast could have become bogged down by the ""spot the star"" syndrome but Sin City engrosses to the point where were no longer watching actors with names but the characters they are playing. For example when we see Elijah Wood were not thinking of Frodo Baggins. And Bruce Willis isnt John McClane. More than anything else thats a testimony to how well Rodriguez does his job. There are three lead male characters - one to anchor each of the trio of episodes that form Sin Citys structure. For the most part these individuals do not cross over and invade each others stories although the same cannot be said of the other personalities inhabiting Basin City. Bruce Willis plays Hartigan a tough-talking cop at the end of a career in a place where honest guys like him are hard to find. Before accepting his pension however Hartigan wants to solve one last case and save an 11-year old girl from the clutches of a serial murderer/rapist (Nick Stahl). He succeeds at least to a point but pays a terrible price in the process. Elsewhere in the city the burly ugly Marv (Mickey Rourke) finds comfort in the arms of a beautiful blonde named Goldie (Jamie King) but when he wakes up the next morning he discovers that she has been murdered and he has been framed for the crime. Determined to avenge her Marv pursues a violent murderous course that takes him to the heart of Basin Citys power structure and seals his fate. Finally theres Dwight (Clive Owen) a wanted man with a new face who helps out the citys prostitutes when they accidentally kill a sleazeball cop Jack Rafferty (Benicio Del Toro). Raffertys demise threatens the uneasy truce that exists in Old Town between the mob the police and the hookers. Dwight agrees to hide the body before the cops figure out what has happened but a group of mobsters have other ideas and kidnap Dwights girlfriend Gail (Rosario Dawson) as a means to thwart him. Another notable performer is Jessica Alba whose career is in the process of going from red-hot to white-hot as the stripper Nancy. Although she shows less skin than either Carla Gugino (as Marvs lesbian parole officer) or Jamie King her allure more than makes up for it. (Alba apparently attended the same stripper school as Natalie Portman - the one where the clothing stays on.) Model-turned-actress Devon Aoki has a role that doesnt challenge her thespian skills. She says nary a word but does some nasty things with swords and other bladed instruments. This is very much Rodriguezs film - like most of his other projects it was ""shot and cut"" by him. He is quick to give Frank Miller equal credit indicating that although the camerawork was his Millers contribution was so great that he deserves to be recognized as a co-director. The Directors Guild disagreed and Rodriguez ended up resigning over the dispute. Quentin Tarantino is listed as a ""Special Guest Director"" whatever that means. Apparently Tarantino shot one (or more) of the films scenes but I couldnt begin to guess which one. Any contribution by the Kill Bill filmmaker blends seamlessly into the overall production never calling attention to itself. Rumor has it that some of the studio executives behind Sin City were looking for a way to get the film a PG-13 rating. Having seen the final cut its mind-boggling to believe that such a watered-down version was ever considered. The violence in this movie may be stylized but theres far too much of it for the MPAA to consider a PG-13. Plus theres plenty of nudity Jamie King bares her breasts and Carla Gugino spends about 50% of her limited screen time wearing little or nothing. Im glad Rodriguez stuck to his guns; a PG-13 version of Sin City would have been a crime. The one that exists is a pleasure.
