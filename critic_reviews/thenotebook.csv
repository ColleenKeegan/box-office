The director Kevin Macdonald searches for clarity amid the contradictions of Marleys life and reaches no conclusions but thats a tribute to his subjects complexity in a film of fascinating too-muchness. ENLARGE Bob Marley in the documentary Marley. Magnolia Pictures Its a concert film of the spoken word with the accent on recollections rather than onstage performance. One after another the people Marley lived with worked with and played with tell their tales in dialects that are always enjoyable for their musicality though sometimes fitted with subtitles for accessibility. The interview subjects range from Marleys widow Rita--the film was made with the familys cooperation--through the surviving member of the Wailers the formidable Bunny Wailer to such deliciously disparate figures as Margaret James his first teacher; Dudley Sibley a singer and the janitor at the Jamaican recording studio where he got his start; his girlfriend and former Miss World Cindy Breakspeare; and his friend Desi Smith who uses the word ""sufferation"" by way of describing the poverty from which Marley rose and to which he beamed back his passion as a third-world superstar and an apostle of black independence before succumbing to cancer in 1981 at the age of 36. As for Marley himself he was notably shy for most of his life and hes an elusive presence in the films relatively few samplings of a limited archive of interview material--at one moment quietly charismatic at another clearly druggy. (With a wink and a nod at the cannabis cognoscenti the film is being released--in theaters and via video on demand--on April 20th which has become a sort of marijuana appreciation day.) ""My heart can be hard as stone yet soft as water"" he says at one point a bit of gnomic self-scrutiny that only hints at the difficulties of pinning him down. A documentary on the life music and legacy of Bob Marley. Video courtesy of Magnolia Pictures. But the importance of defining Marley dwindles alongside the pleasure of learning about his singular life. As a young man smitten by music troubled by his mixed-race heritage and hungry for a higher calling hes inspired by the emperor of Ethiopia Haile Selassie who becomes his king of kings after the aging monarch pays a wildly popular visit to Jamaica. (Talk about contradictions Listening to the worshipful strains of Marleys ""Selassie Is the Chapel"" I thought of ""The Emperor"" Ryszard Kapuscinskis remarkable book based on interviews with former ministers and courtiers that portrays Selassies court in the last years of his reign as a place of obscene excess surrounded by poverty and of pervasive fear bordering on madness.) In the fullness of his fame--which was late to extend to the U.S.--Marley returns to Jamaica as the emperor of a musical realm and shortly after being shot plays a peace concert to calm the nation at a flash point in its history. The films 144-minute running time gives a sense that the filmmaker couldnt let a single frame fall to the cutting room floor. Mr. Macdonalds new documentary is neither as polished nor--unavoidably given the subject--as powerful as ""One Day in September"" his Oscar-winning account of the Palestinian terrorist attack on the Israeli team at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich. Still too-muchness is no sin and no one can accuse ""Marley"" of not-enoughness. The Lucky One ENLARGE Taylor Schilling as Beth and Zac Efron as Logan in The Lucky One adapted from the Nicholas Sparks novel. Warner Bros. Pictures Depending on how you feel about Zac Efron he is either a sensitive hunk or an inexpressive hunk but definitely a hunk. Unable as I am to locate any feelings about him I see Mr. Efron as a hunk with a problem delivering sustained dialogue in units of more than one or two sentences. The camera is conflicted about seeing him in ""The Lucky One"" which was directed by Scott Hicks. Whenever possible it dotes on his handsome face but turns away to other actors for reaction shots during his speeches which seem to have been pieced together from extremely short takes. A Marine travels to North Carolina after serving three tours in Iraq and searches for the unknown woman he believes was his good luck charm during the war. Video courtesy of Warners. The production as a whole has been pieced together quite smoothly from the novel of the same name by Nicholas Sparks whose books spawn backlit scenes of wounded souls working out their fates. (Alar Kivilo did the sumptuous cinematography.) Mr. Efrons Logan a Marine Corps sergeant is back from his third tour of duty in Iraq where he found a photo of a beautiful woman. Next thing you know--well next thing after a little detective work and a solitary walk from Colorado to Louisiana--hes at the door of her family-run kennel looking for work. Her name is Beth and shes played attractively by Taylor Schilling who survived hard duty as the heroine of last years ghastly ""Atlas Shrugged."" Beth resists Logan as long as she can--he tends to creep her out because he cant tell her why hes come--but things work out for them in a plot that resembles a game of checkers rather than chess. Blythe Danner graces her every scene as Beths mother. Jay R. Ferguson is Beths ex-husband Keith a heavy who redefines overwrought. The kennels dogs are mostly playful and the movie uses exactly the right amount of Spanish moss. To the Arctic 3-D ENLARGE Polar bears relax in To the Arctic 3D. Warner Bros. Pictures IMAX films are nothing if not immersive but theyre also confrontive. The first awesome image that confronts you in this one wont be mistaken for the white cliffs of Dover. Its a vast white glacier that is melting via waterfalls notched in its face in an Arctic that is warming Meryl Streeps narration tells us twice as fast as any other region of the planet. The films subject is polar bears--did you know as I did not that these white giants began as brown bears and have adapted to their habitat over the course of 150000 years?--but global warming is its subtext and sometimes it isnt so sub. A 3D journey into the lives of a mother polar bear and her two seven-month-old cubs as they navigate the changing Arctic wilderness they call home. Video courtesy of Warners. ""To the Arctic 3-D""--the 3-D is neither impressive nor intrusive--can and should be seen in a number of IMAX theaters and science museums around the country; later it will go into more general distribution. The superb nature footage takes in walruses and caribou as well as bears but bears are at the center of the frozen stage cavorting and snuggling on ever-shrinking ice floes when the temperature is 30 degrees below zero. And the stars tracked by cameras at close range for nearly a week are a mother and her twin cubs heedless kidlets who delight in the deep freeze but are threatened by roving males. (They prey on defenseless cubs when they cant make meals of seals that are increasingly hard to come by as the changing climate and degrading habitat take their toll.) For all the majesty of the photography I was bothered at first by the insistent score which uses songs by Paul McCartney as well as original music by Steve Wood. But then the insistence came clear as an emotional strategy. ""To the Arctic 3-D"" is an impassioned plea for action on global warming and the passion is intensified by the music. Watch the mother nestle her cubs to the strains of ""Calico Skies""--""It was written that I would love you""--and you want to weep then buy a solar panel. The Last King of Scotland (2006) Kevin Macdonalds powerful drama is action-packed although ultimately to a fault and built around a starring performance that embodies the classic notion of what actors are supposed to do--act on the characters around them with all the psychic and physical energy at their command. Forest Whitakers portrayal of the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin is enormous mercurial terrifying endlessly seductive and more simply put one of the great performances of modern movie history. This monster is a psychopath but also a charmer and a narcissist with a deadly gift for sensing the needs of others. Touching the Void (2003) In this thrilling re-creation of a now-legendary story Kevin Macdonald who adapted Joe Simpsons nonfiction book of the same name straddles the space between fiction film and documentary. The film is about existential choice that of a mountaineer with a grievously injured partner who will or wont cut the partner loose to save himself. As the details unfold you forget that youre watching actors playing the climbers both in straight-to-the-camera interviews and in brilliantly staged vignettes on the face of the mountain. In ""Touching the Void"" the end of the rope is but the beginning. The Notebook (2004) Top-drawer Nicholas Sparks on screen directed impeccably by Nick Cassavetes. Ripe with feeling and lush with physical beauty its a love story that swings confidently between age and youth. The focus is mainly on youth in a narrative that has James Garner and Gena Rowlands as a husband and wife near the end of their days--her memory is almost gone--and Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams as passionate lovers. Youth may be wasted on the young but not in a movie where its seen as a glorious rehearsal for age. --Joe Morgenstern Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Comments The Notebook Rated PG-13  121 minutes The title refers to a handwritten story set in the 1940s that elderly James Garner reads to a spaced-out Gena Rowlands as she lives out her final days in a geriatric hospital; interspersed with these scenes are dramatized episodes from the story a horribly trite romance between a poor boy (Ryan Gosling) and a rich girl (Rachel McAdams) whose genteel mother (Joan Allen) considers him ""trash trash trash"" The connection between the two narratives is supposed to be a big heartbreaking surprise though I figured it out well in advance and spent the interim unfavorably comparing this greatest-generation hanky wringer (2004) to the British drama Iris.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

True? We dont immediately know) to an aged woman (Gena Rowlands) despite her struggles with Alzheimers disease. What Duke reads becomes the main body of the film a 1940s romance in Seabrook N.C. between 17-year-old Allie and gutsy 19-year-old Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) who courts her with the relentlessness of a catbird. Will she go out with him? Will she? Huh? Hes poor. Shes from an affluent family. She declines. And declines. But Noah eventually has his way. Allie becomes entranced by this boy on their first date -- right after he insists they lie down in the middle of the road in front of a traffic light. Adapted from Nicholas Sparkss 1996 bestseller of the same name ""The Notebook"" is hokum from the get-go. But McAdams (who has already proved her mettle in ""Mean Girls"") brings her archetypal rich girl to resounding life; and Gosling imbues Noah with beguiling unaffectedness. Its hard not to like these two or begrudge them a great love together. The story however has other ideas. Their desire to be with each other gets a constant buffeting. It starts with opposition from Allies parents (David Thornton and Joan Allen) who sure dont need a poor country boy as kin (stop me when you hear something original). It continues with Allies trip to college (which her mother insists upon worried about her daughters affection for Noah) and Noahs participation in World War II. When he returns still in love with Allie the biggest problem of all awaits Allies love for another man. Lon Hammond (James Marsden) is rich. He gets along beautifully with Allies parents. Hes devoted to Allie. And hes just slipped a fat engagement ring on her finger. The less said about the rest of the movie the better its chances with you. Director Nick Cassavetes and screenwriters Jan (""Shine"") Sardi and Jeremy Leven (who wrote the delightful ""Don Juan DeMarco"") do their best work with the character behavior in the story rather than the predictable structure. (They are contending after all with the maudlin work of novelist Sparks who also wrote ""Message in a Bottle"" and ""A Walk to Remember."") Speaking of sentimental its gratifying to see Cassavetes directing Rowlands his mother who with her husband John Cassavetes (Nicks father) made some of the great independent films of the American cinema. What a shame they couldnt have collaborated on something more in the spirit of the departed John. THE NOTEBOOK (PG-13 121 minutes) -- Contains sexual situations. Area theaters.

Indeed it seems as though the genre of heavy-handed tearjerker has become as reliable a seasonal bonbon at the multiplex as the disaster picture and the comic-book blockbuster. <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=hornadaynode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;dir=hornaday;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;ad=hp;pos=ad26;sz=300x250;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1088168977284?""></a> <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=hornadaynode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;dir=hornaday;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;ad=hp;pos=ad27;sz=160x600;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1088168977285?""></a> <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=hornadaynode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;dir=hornaday;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;ad=hp;pos=ad24;sz=336x850;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1088168977285?""></a> In other words ""The Notebook"" is a chick flick. It can also be filed under the heading ""Wealthy Peoples Problems"" as its female protagonist wrinkles her brow and worries whether to marry the guy with the waterfront property or the heir to the cotton fortune (and fiddle-dee-dee which one will fetch her barbecue?). It spoils nothing to divulge that all ends well although director Nick Cassavetes does everything he can to milk the maximum amount of tragedy from what properly understood qualifies as a reasonably happy ending. ""The Notebook"" which has been adapted from the Nicholas Sparks novel by Jan Sardi and Jeremy Leven is the story of Allie Hamilton and Noah Calhoun who meet as teenagers in 1940 in coastal South Carolina. Switching between the present day and flashbacks to 60 years ago the movie chronicles their idyllic summer romance which blossoms into a full-blown love affair until Allies upper-crust parents put the kibosh on it. They go their separate ways -- Allie to Sarah Lawrence and wartime volunteer work Noah to the local lumberyard where he was working when he met Allie then to North Africa with Patton. Upon his return Noah begins obsessively rehabilitating the riverside house where he and Allie almost consummated their passion; she has taken up with Lon a handsome wealthy veteran who is more in keeping with her prim mothers expectations for her. Before the wedding though Allie pays a visit to Noah and must decide between the man who befits her station and the one who encourages her to indulge her bohemian nature (signified by her painting on the veranda in the nude). One of the strengths of ""The Notebook"" aside from its honey-toned production values and unapologetic voluptuousness is that it keeps the audience guessing whom she chooses right up until the end. The movies flashbacks -- in which Allie and Noah are played by Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling -- are bracketed by a contemporary story in which a now-ill Allie (Gena Rowlands) is being read to by her husband (James Garner). Of course the books fans will know how the story ends but they may still be captivated all over again by ""The Notebooks"" sweeping romanticism. Never mind that McAdams and Gosling dont for a minute call to mind 1940s America; theyre both suitably attractive and appealing. Gosling who delivered a searing and largely unseen screen debut performance in the 2001 drama ""The Believer"" is particularly convincing as a young man who charms his way past a girls strongest defenses. If Gosling is a canny choice for a romantic lead and if Joan Allen is porcelain perfection as Allies icy mother less convincing is David Thornton as Allies father. Thornton is usually the go-to guy for supporting roles as nervous urban sophisticates; hes far less comfortable with the outsize handlebar mustache and Southern drawl hes forced to affect here. And it seems to be laying it on a little thick when young Noah is seen not only reading Walt Whitman aloud but reading it to a father played by Sam Shepard. But Cassavetes soon goes from laying sentiment on thick to shoveling it on with a backhoe when the love story reaches its harrowing conclusion. Shifting tone with startling awkwardness Cassavetes transforms the story from a gently lilting soap opera to a bleak depiction of the troubled last stages of life albeit one well lived. For a more authentic and profoundly moving meditation on the power of love to endure the ravages of memory viewers are directed to Richard Eyres ""Iris"" or even the recent Jim Carrey vehicle ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."" As for ""The Notebook"" the intention is clearly to leave no eye in the house undabbed and as the endless number of endings attest this is a movie that isnt ashamed to wring each teardrop by any means necessary. The Notebook (121 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for some sexuality.

Directed by Nick Cassavetes from a screenplay by Jeremy Leven based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks. 121 minutes. Rated PG-13 for some sexuality. Several theaters. E-mail this article Print this article Search archive Most e-mailed articles Other links Movies and showtimes Search movies Sign up for movies e-mail Nick Cassavetes ""The Notebook"" is a generic Hallmark-card romance/weepie right down to the slow-motion birds flying into the sunset as a gentle piano tinkles. (Why are the birds in slow motion? Because it takes longer that way. Everything in this movie seems to take forever except World War II which passes by in a flash like an inconvenient visitor who needs to be quickly shown the door.) Anyway the film based on Nicholas Sparks popular novel tells two parallel love stories told in two different time periods. In the contemporary one an elderly man (James Garner) reads a romance to an elegant confused woman (Gena Rowlands) as it seems to calm her anxieties. (She has the sort of dementia popular among filmmakers and novelists in that it appears only when convenient for the story.) The story he reads is that of Noah (Ryan Gosling) and Allie (Rachel McAdams) who meet and fall in love in 1940. Their romance seems doomed because of Allies controlling wealthy parents (""Hes trash Not for you"" says Mom) and because ... well things take a long time in this movie. (Its sort of a slow-motion romance constantly interrupted.) So theres plenty of time to ponder Goslings naughty smile -- his Noah is charmingly amused with himself -- or the movies seemingly endless supply of cliched lovers dialogue or all the pretty art-direction details like the fact that a flower Noah gives Allie one morning perfectly matches the blanket shes wrapped herself in. Its all sweet and gooey and absolutely predictable in a bland TV-movie sort of way with an ending so shameless it should come with an apology. Rowlands (who incidentally is the directors mother -- didnt she raise him for better things than this?) has a few haunting moments -- her eyes are emptied out her expression still and sad. Its a performance that belongs in a more honest movie. By the end of ""The Notebooks"" interminable two hours the only tears that spring to mind are of relief.

An epic story of love lost and found from New Line Productions.

Starring Ryan Gosling Rachel McAdams James Garner Gena Rowlands James Marsden and Joan Allen. Directed by Nick Cassavetes. (PG-13. 121 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Ronald Reagan would hardly have objected to blurring the lines between real life and film since he often did so himself telling supposedly true stories that turned out to be dialogue from his movie roles. So theres my license to point out similarities between Ronald and Nancy Reagan s lifelong love affair and the one sweetly captured in ""The Notebook"" an old-fashioned and occasionally schmaltzy movie that delivers an emotional wallop sure to elicit tears from all but those with truly intractable hearts. Both blissful marriages -- the real and the fictional -- endure the test of Alzheimers and both prove their resilience. Theres a poetic irony in the release of this touching picture so soon after death finally parted the inseparable first couple. ""The Notebook"" focuses on the roots of a marriage for life not on the nightmarish effects of an insidious disease. Unlike Judi Denchs disheveled appearance in ""Iris"" Gena Rowlands as an Alzheimers sufferer is perfectly coifed and made up and except for a blankness around her eyes could be headed for a tea party. James Garner even more adorable with age plays her devoted husband who moves into a plush nursing facility rather than be apart from his beloved. The scenes at the home strive to get details about Alzheimers right such as a nurses use of the word ""sundowning"" to describe Rowlands agitation as night begins to fall. In her few lucid moments she recognizes elements of the story her husband reads her every day from a well-thumbed notebook. In it a spirited Southern debutante named Allie (not unlike the Zelda immortalized by F. Scott Fitzgerald minus the craziness) becomes enraptured with a mill worker over the objections of her snobbish parents. Her blazing romance with Noah takes over ""The Notebook"" transporting it to the lush expanse of the deep South in the 1940s. The movie is largely faithful to Nicholas Sparks best-selling novel except that screenwriter Jeremy Leven has tinkered with the chronology and added some spicy sex scenes between the young couple appealingly played by Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling. McAdams (last seen in ""Mean Girls"") is a star in the making and Gosling emerges from his dark depressing roles in ""The Believer"" and ""Murder by Numbers"" to be a romantic figure. The actors set off sparks from their first scene together at a carnival when Noah becomes convinced hes met the girl of his dreams. But forces conspire against them including an underhanded attempt by her mother (a subdued Joan Allen) to end the relationship and of course a rival suitor (James Marsden proving his appeal as something other than a mutant) whos better-looking than Noah. The connection between the youngsters we watch fall in love and the old couple at the home becomes rather obvious but Ill leave it to audiences to connect the dots. Nick Cassavetes directs in a straightforward manner and there are moments when the movie sags under the weight of its sentimentality. His real talent comes in casting. The principals are uniformly pitch perfect including Rowlands who happens to be Cassavetes mother though few would call this nepotism. In its traditional approach ""The Notebook"" is a sharp contrast with the experimental films of the directors father John Cassavetes. But in a summer filled with loud action movies theres something to be said for a quiet story of enduring love. -- Advisory This film contains mildly suggestive sexual scenes.

"Love shows its age in Notebook - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Love shows its age in Notebook By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  June 25 2004 ""The Notebook"" is a dusky movie. It begins in twilight and ends there two hours later. A plucky sudser about young lovers in 1940s North Carolina adapted from Nicholas Sparkss bestseller the story is frequently interrupted by trips to a modern-day nursing home to remind the romantics in the audience that love doesnt die. But it does get gray.The movie invites us to watch two comely ingenues -- Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams -- fall in love in 1940 then separate just before the start of World War II. Noah Calhoun (Gosling) and Allie Hamilton (McAdams) have one of those passionate affairs that spans both sides of the tracks. Shes filthy rich. Hes not but for what its worth he does aspire to build the girl the house of her dreams. Allies cartoonishly snobby parents dont care. Her father (David Thornton) wears a bushy black mustache that might as well be wax. Joan Allen phones in her part as the forbidding mother and her performance might be made of wax too.Allie fights her folks demand that she stop spending so much time with Noah and his genial dad (Sam Shepard) at their country shack. But he martyrs himself and breaks things off. She moves away and he writes her a letter a day for a year during which time Mrs. Hamilton hoards them as a decent evil mother must. In the 14 intervening years Noah goes off to war and grows a beard and Allie goes to Sarah Lawrence where she volunteers as a nurse and cares for Lon Hammond (James Marsden) a handsome lawyer who hails from old money. Noah meanwhile returns from overseas buries his father and gets to work on building that dream house which upon completion is featured in the local paper. Just as shes being fitted for her wedding dress Allie sees it and promptly passes out. She pays a visit to Noah and to the house and the movie takes its time telling us which man Allie will choose. Although you dont have to be a genius to figure it out.McAdams gave a sharp performance as the chief meanie in ""Mean Girls."" It was easy to forget her because frankly I didnt think Id be seeing much of her other than in parts as shallow vipers. Here shes soulfully committed to the suds in the story and fiercely attentive to the other actors. I like watching her watch people especially Gosling who stares back hard enough to bore holes. Roles in ""The Believer"" and ""Murder by Numbers"" have demonstrated that Gosling is adept at playing sociopaths and intense brooders and theres reason to think early on that Noah might be similarly off as when he threatens to drop from a Ferris wheel unless Allie agrees to go on a date with him. Theres only one note to a Gosling performance -- long-faced determination -- but hes good at playing it.Occasionally ""The Notebook"" leaps forward decades to show James Garner reading this tale of the young and the passionate to Gena Rowlands whos playing a woman who has terrible Alzheimers but can focus enough on Garners light fable to find it addictive. Who is this man and what is he to this story she seems to wonder.As adapted by Jan Sardi and Jeremy Leven and directed by Nick Cassavetes Rowlandss son ""The Notebook"" is two movies one dubiously hitched to the other like ""On Golden Pond"" stuffed inside some young-adult romance. I didnt read Sparkss novel. But the trailer more or less tells you how the present relates to the past. Was it even a secret in the book?Regardless I realized that because the movie is less than conventionally structured my anticipation for a last-minute bait-and-switch among the characters (Will Garner turn out to be someone other than the person you know he is? Will Rowlands?) was really just an enjoyable enough wait for the other shoe to drop which it does.Rowlandss characters dementia turns her violent and its all Garner can do to watch. Why Cassavetes would want to steer his mother to this level of discomfort is a question for the family therapist but she does give one of her more interesting recent performances. Still considering the sunny relatively pleasurable romantic business that precedes it the elderly stuff seems dark morbid and forced upon us.

"Notebook The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; notebook-the ) Notebook The (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli I have not read Nicholas Sparks The Notebook but I have heard good word-of-mouth about the novel. Sadly the elements that made the book special did not survive the transition to the screen. The Notebook as adapted by Nick Cassavetes from a screenplay by Jan Sardi and Jeremy Leven comes across as an ordinary romantic melodrama with a maudlin and ineffective climax. Its the kind of story for which no term seems more appropriate than ""soap opera."" The film unfolds in two time frames featuring the same characters. In the modern day scenes Noah is played by James Garner and Allie by Gena Rowlands (the directors mother). In the sequences that transpire around World War II the leads are Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. It turns out that Allie is suffering from dementia so to stir her memories Noah reads from a notebook that recounts their tumultuous improbable romance. They met as teenagers in pre-WWII America. For Noah it was love at first sight but it took him a while to convince Allie. Almost immediately the disparity of their social classes became an issue - she came from money and he was a laborer. The disapproval of Allies mother (Joan Allen) led to their break-up. But fate brought them together after the war and before Allie married her soldier beau (James Marsden). The 1940s sequences are superior to those that transpire in the 2000s. Admittedly the love affair between Allie and Noah is typical stuff but Cassevetes directs the actors competently the characters are likeable (you want them to end up together) and theres evident chemistry between Gosling and McAdams. The cinematography is evocative and the music never goes over-the-top. Unfortunately things dont work nearly as well when Garner and Rowlands take over the parts. Their aspect of the story doesnt work. It comes across as a badly diluted imitation of Iris (which handles the issue of fading memory with more poignancy than The Notebook could hope for). And not only are the modern-day scenes dramatically inert but its virtually impossible to accept that these are the same people as the ones falling in love in the 40s. Fortunately only about 20% of the movie unfolds when the characters are in their twilight years. The Notebook represents an instance when the desire to obtain a particular MPAA rating has resulted in some bizarre choices. To avoid courting an R the actors are forced to cover themselves with sheets and the camera is often positioned in a way that makes it seem almost as if the characters are posing. The material in The Notebook is inherently adult in nature (how many teenagers are going to see this movie?) so why neuter its sexuality in pursuit of a PG-13? Fans of sudsy romances will adore The Notebook but the film fails to manipulate the intellect with the same effectiveness that it tweaks the emotions. The best thing that can be said about the movie is that its a worthy antidote to the usual testosterone-driven summer fare but in its inability to effectively develop the modern aspect of the story it fails to throw the tear-jerking emotional punch it might have achieved.

Mixture of classical Hollywood textures and emotional rawness from a gifted cast is balanced by helmer Nick Cassavetes. Fan base will come for seconds. Every bit the unashamed tearjerker fans of the popular novel expect ""The Notebook"" is a determined and often affecting romance that doesnt speak down to audiences. Mixture of classical Hollywood textures and emotional rawness from a gifted cast is deftly balanced by helmer Nick Cassavetes while Jeremy Levens script (with ""adaptation"" credit to ""Shine"" scripter Jan Sardi) is no slave to Nicholas Sparks tome even as it blatantly plucks the heartstrings. Guaranteed fan base driven by women will come for seconds and wide age appeal should provide sustained early summer returns. Sparks debut novel set the themes now long familiar to his followers Tales of true love interrupted by outside forces with hope for later renewal. New pic far outstrips the previous Sparks adaptations ""Message in a Bottle"" and ""A Walk to Remember"" and took the longest (seven years) to get to the screen. Protracted development with multiple directors (Steven Spielberg Jim Sheridan Martin Campbell) coming and going hinted at a troubled project but film plays smoothly. Postcard-like opening images ease into the gentle interaction between two retirement home residents -- Duke (James Garner) who readsaloud from a notebook/diary that chronicles a long-term love and Allie Calhoun (Gena Rowlands) who tries to listen as her mind drifts in and out of dementia. As the notebooks saga takes overthe film takes a fairly chronological path -- more so than the book. Instantly smitten when he first sees her at a North Carolina fair Noah (Ryan Gosling)hangs from a Ferris wheel to get Allie (Rachel McAdams) to go on a date with him. Though a certain deliberate cuteness makes the couples emotional connection feel facile at first Cassavetes (perhaps inspired by his father Johns improvisational predilections) encourages his extremely talented and attractive young actors to let their hair down for natural exchanges that push through the pent-up conventions of Hollywood period drama. Summer romance that blossoms between working-class Noah and prep school gal Allie is charming enough but its their fights -- and breakup after her wealthySouthern parents Anne and John (Joan Allen David Thornton) forbid their frolics -- that dramatize how deeply these two feel for each other. Midsections notable dip is probably unavoidable as Dukes narration takes over (though Garners voice is always inviting) to describe morose Noahs life as a World War II soldier. He sees best buddy Fin (Kevin Connolly) die during the (briefly seen) Battle of the Bulge before returning home to dad Frank (Sam Shepard) -- with whom he shares a good relationship and a love of Walt Whitman -- to restore a long-dormant mansion as their home. Allies life takes a turn when Lon (James Marsden) a wounded soldier she nurses during the war recovers (a bit too amazingly) to become her dashing ambitious fiance. Just as the former lovers lives appear settled events grow more interesting as Allie -- having seen a news item about Noahs restoration of the mansion -- ventures to see him one last time before her marriage. Passage placed in its proper time frame rather than at the beginning as in the novel now has greater resonance with revelations about Noahs hundreds of letters to Allie -- and why her mother Anne kept Allie from reading them. None of this nor a final and touching present-day sequence as Duke seems to have triggered Allies memories and beat back her dementia if only for a few minutes will surprise those who can read between the lines. But Garner and Rowlands are allowed the last word and enact a Liebestod that plays like a force of nature. Already one of the most intriguing young thesps Gosling extends his range to pure romance without sacrificing a bit of his naturally subversive qualities and even seems comfortable looking beautiful in a manly American way. The head-turner is McAdams doing such a different perf from her top bitch in ""Mean Girls"" that its hard to tell its the same actor. She skillfully carries much of the films emotional weight with a free and easy manner. Marsden exudes charm complicating Allies options. Allen as always finds surprising dramatic depths. Production has second-unit credits devoted to ""beauty"" and ""waterfowl."" Lenser Robert Fraisse lusciously captures both of these elements along with the characters while Sarah Knowles sets and Karyn Wagners costumes are classy and class-conscious.
