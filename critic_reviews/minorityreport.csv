By Anthony Lane The worst thing about the new Steven Spielberg picture is the title ""Minority Report."" The best thing about it is pretty much everything else. After his unhappy fathomings of the future with ""A.I."" Spielberg has plunged back in and fished up something rich and strange. ""Minority Report"" is set in the year 2054 and Spielberg who knows better than anyone how to knead the homely into the exotic is careful to suggest that for every shift in social mores other details have stayed the same. Businessmen still wear a suit and tie to the office; policemen on the other hand race toward trouble spots not in a wailing squad car but in the belly of a giant hair dryer. The idea one presumes is that any terrified suspects can be rapidly coiffed into submission but that is the least of their worries. What really gets to them is Precrime. This is the flourishing psychojudicial field in which John Anderton (Tom Cruise) currently toils and spins. The premise is simple in the way that eugenics was simple the state--or rather Washington D.C. where the scheme is under trial before it goes national-- is now able to unearth a murder before it happens and so prevent it from coming to pass. The authorities get the names of the perpetrator and the victim; thus equipped they merely have to work out the location hop into the hair dryer and trust that they make it in time. Such are the conditions of the opening sequence which lasts a good twenty minutes and which reminds us that when it comes to stepping on the gas of a plot Spielberg can still summon the contagious excitement of a young buck. Yet the texture of the material here could hardly be more grownup; to see a Spielberg film that starts with both sex and violence as ""Minority Report"" does is one of the more unexpected events in a moviegoers life like coming across a tea party in the middle of late Peckinpah. Knowing the hook of ""Minority Report"" I was bracing myself for topical nods toward the issue of genetic predisposition; it doesnt seem too unlikely that half a century on scientists will be capable of separating those members of the community destined for homicide from those whose DNA has programmed them to commit home baking instead. In the event we get the Pre-Cognitives. They may sound like an angry British rock combo but they are in fact three swimsuited human figures of mysterious origin who lie in a flotation tank and deliver their visions of upcoming horror which are then transferred or bootlegged onto the screens of Precrime. In short Spielberg is propping up his future with a relic of the past the Pre-Cogs--notably the most intense of the trio Agatha (Samantha Morton)--are just doing what the Oracle did at Delphi or the Sibyl at Cumae. What Spielberg gets from them however is the promise of suspense and that is what he treasures most; this new movie is hot with visual wit and there are patches of action-- a police search of a crummy apartment building say using dedicated robot spiders--where you can feel him absolutely flying. When Agatha is taken from her tank and guided stumbling onto the Washington streets her powers of prophecy which she is helpless to control stream like curses from the cave of her mouth. She grabs a passing woman in a shopping mall and says to her ""He knows. Dont go home."" The womans face drains and freezes and we never see her again. The movie was written by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen and adapted from a 1956 tale by Philip K. Dick whose labyrinthine brain was also the source of ""Blade Runner"" and ""Total Recall."" If you think you can wrap your head around all that occurs in ""Minority Report"" you dont know Dick. And if you think that the Spielberg who fretted his way through ""Schindlers List"" and ""A.I."" might have grown rusty on the thrill of the chase--the chance to elaborate with hectic sophistication on the highly primitive fear of being caught--then here is your answer. What most galled his fans about movies like ""Always"" and ""Amistad"" was that the characters were not just stuck in the past but apparently nailed to the floor with no place to go; whereas when Anderton the hero of ""Minority Report"" is himself tipped as a killer by the Pre-Cogs and forced on the run you feel Spielberg haring along by his side like a dog in a park. If you escape in 2054 of course you dont just jump into a getaway car; you jump from one car to the next as the cars run up and down the outside of a skyscraper as smooth as a row of zippers. Or better yet you crouch inside a car on a production line while it is still being built then calmly motor off in the completed vehicle. This is a benign version of Hitchcocks wicked plan mused on but never filmed to show a car being assembled and a corpse falling out at the end proof if any were needed that Spielberg is the perfect antidote to Hitchcock--he puts us through the shredder but he wants us to sleep well. I must admit that my bedroom walls have never been shrouded in posters of Tom Cruise; this however is his meatiest performance since ""Magnolia"" and Spielberg keen to investigate rather than indulge him catches something futuristic something only ninety-five-per-cent human in the angled prow of Cruises brow and nose. The most beautiful shot in the film is not a special effect but a double profile of two heads Cruises and Samantha Mortons; they are coiled together in a desperate embrace which spells intimacy yet each is facing outward which tells a different story. Morton who spoke not a word in Woody Allens ""Sweet and Lowdown"" has gone from mute to newt spending most of ""Minority Report"" looking shy and moist; but shes so bewildering a presence a combustible compound of android and angel that the role doesnt feel like an imposition and you more than sympathize with the techno-wonk who meeting the Pre-Cog in the flesh falls to his knees before her and cries ""Im sorry for what Im going to do and I swear I didnt do any of it."" In fact the casting of ""Minority Report"" may be the smartest in the history of Spielberg. He has Lois Smith playing a middle-aged boffin the inventor of Precrime who waters her venomous flowers and plants a sudden kiss on the lips of Tom Cruise (in the strangest manifestation to date of Spielbergs obsession with the maternal). The film also genuflects to Bergman by using Max Von Sydow resembling as usual a Lutheran pastor who slipped sideways into drama in the part of Andertons boss. Then there is Neal McDonough as a stalwart of the Precrime squad; I punched the air when I saw him having clocked those eyes of unmeltable blue set in that square blond head in last years ""Band of Brothers"" and wagered a friend that McDonough would reach stardom within two years. Finally we get Colin Farrell who is almost there already and fighting to hold steady in a flood of hype; on the evidence of this picture the fuss is justified. He plays Danny Witwer who has been sent by the Justice Department to assess Precrime and in his loosened tie and black suit his beetle-browed refusal to take any crap he attacks the movie like a young Robert Ryan. Whether he can go on to find anything moving in the meanness like Ryan only time or a Pre-Cog can tell. When Farrell departs the movie something about it droops and fades. The whodunit is well wrapped up--anyone schooled in ""L.A. Confidential"" will have solved it long before--and as with ""Blade Runner"" the glare and heat of Dicks imaginings seem to outglow the settlement of narrative scores. Spielberg didnt co-write this project as he did ""A.I."" and Cruise didnt co-produce it as he did ""Mission Impossible 2""; no one in other words is pulling rank here and you sense a poise in the picture as if everyone had banded together to extract as much fun--a ferocity of invention verging on the comical--from what is unarguably a dark political prospect. Spielberg the liberal is asking what the dangers might be when law and order submit to logic and nothing else; but there is no way that Spielberg the entertainer the manager of the fairground is going to stop himself from demonstrating just what kind of mad buzz the logic might produce. Thats why all of us not just professional philosophers will enjoy Cruise shouting ""I am placing you under arrest for the future murder of . . ."" And thats why as he grapples with another cops fiery jetpack while trying to escape and the two of them burn through the air and crash through a window into a family kitchen you get ready for a Spielberg moment. And there it is a one-second shot of hamburgers instantly grilled by the blast of rocket flare. I hate to say it but ""Minority Report"" is a whopper.

"Minority Report (Movie) Select a Guide All Guides Best Doctors Best Lawyers Cheap Guide Everything Guides Family amp; Kids Home Design NYC Weddings Spas amp; Fitness Opening This Week Now Playing Box Office Top 10 Movie Reviews Theater Listing Indie Art Houses Logan Hill Main Culture Page Art Books amp; the Word Classical amp; Dance Kids Movies Music Theater TV Movies Minority Report Set in the year 2054 Steven Spielbergs Minority Report looks clammy and bleached-out. The oppressiveness of course is intentional but is it necessary? High-concept science-fiction escapades often try to impose new ways of seeing but Spielberg seems intent on blistering our optic nerves. Like A.I. Minority Report is a movie in furious conflict with itself. Hope is pitted rather unsuccessfully against dystopia -- or is it dyspepsia? The result is one of the glummest and most forbidding thrillers ever. Tom Cruise plays John Anderton who runs the Justice Departments Precrime unit which acts on evidence provided by three human ""Pre-cogs"" who float in a liquid suspension chamber and can see visions of future murders. The images they transmit are displayed in haphazard fragments on a giant screen before which Anderton stands like a maestro sorting out the pictures with sweeping waves of his arms. The garish fractured visuals may cause some in the audience to experience deja vu Can it be that the Pre-cogs are channeling the credit sequence from Seven? The Precrime cops tipped by the trio swoop down and arrest potential murderers who are contained in a comatose state in long pneumatic tubes while their misdeeds are played out before their eyes. The moral dilemma is that none of the convicted is actually guilty of anything in the present. But because the Pre-cogs are supposed to be infallible and because the murder rate in Washington D.C. for the past six years has dropped to zero the public is enthusiastic and there is a political initiative pending to make Precrime go national. Then comes the twist Anderton is implicated in the murder within 36 hours of a man he doesnt even know. Believing himself innocent and set up by his enemies he goes on the lam. Either he is a murderer-to-be or the Pre-cogs are wrong -- which would call into question everything Anderton stands for as a crime fighter. There are some extraordinary sequences in Minority Report and they are almost always the ones in which Spielberg lets loose his genius for graphic movement. In one scene Anderton jumps across lanes of magnetic-levitation cars that speed both horizontally and vertically through the automated cityscape. In the films best set piece he submerges himself in a bathtub while mechanical spiders try to identify him by scanning his retina. (The action is so astonishingly deft that the pop of a single air bubble caps the scene.) The futurist vision of a consumer society in Minority Report -- which was written by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen and very loosely based on a longish and dullish 1956 Philip K. Dick story -- is alarmingly plausible. By scanning our eyes companies will track our whereabouts and personalize the hard sell as never before. Malls will be lined with talking billboards on a first-name basis with us. (This is the rare movie where the plethora of product placements actually serves a legitimate dramatic function.) And yet whats alarming to us may not be quite so scary to Spielberg the corporate-honcho visionary who simply presents this stuff as a fact of (future) life. His attitude is a wary bemusement. What really spooks him as in A.I. is that it may no longer be possible to be truly human in such a cyberfuture. Anderton in addition to his Precrime problems is also aggrieved by the unsolved kidnapping six years ago of his son. He compulsively plays back holographic home movies of his boy and has a drug habit. All this is meant to humanize Anderton for us but Tom Cruise doesnt really have much inner life as an actor and so the effect is muddled. Anderton is supposed to be running away from himself from his demons but thats not what comes across. Hes running to get away. Cruise has become such a movie-star icon that were supposed to gasp in awe whenever he gets down and dirty and messes with his iconography. In what amounted to a ghastly piece of reverse narcissism in Vanilla Sky he spent half the movie sporting a surgically distended face. (Its as if he were saying ""Look how ugly I make myself and still you watch me."") In Minority Report hes such a dynamo that he converts even the process of grieving into a form of aerobics. Cruise carries the movie but I was relieved to turn to some of the other players including Colin Farrell as Andertons nemesis and Samantha Morton as the most gifted of the Pre-cogs for more evocative human shadings. Spielberg is still in his Kubrick mode in Minority Report which is to say that even more than in A.I. he has split himself off from the verve and emotional sympathy that characterize his best films. I respect his desire to challenge himself and go deeper and darker. Its just that most of whats dark about Minority Report is basically futuro film noir and whats ""deep"" about it are the standard sci-fi tropes about the individual vs. society and whats real and what isnt as well as the usual quasi-religious overtones about playing God. Ultimately the film turns into a soporific anthem for the power to choose ones future followed by a quick fadeout of family togetherness. Although he cant quite get himself to do it Spielberg clearly wants to drop the sentimentality from his repertoire That anthem strikes a hollow chord and the family idealizations are one-note. Minority Report is among other things Spielbergs attempt to extirpate once and for all his inner E.T. Like Cruise he desires to deface his own image which is perhaps why this new movie specializes in shots of severed eyeballs -- its practically a motif. The most visually dynamic director of his generation wants to know what its like to fly blind. Thats what most repels him -- and attracts him. Hes virtuosic enough to keep Minority Report aloft but hes not soaring.-- PETER RAINER Quoted Spielberg and Cruise Minority Report is based on a Philip K. Dick short story that Tom Cruise showed Steven Spielberg while Cruise was filming Eyes Wide Shut and Spielberg was preparing A.I. Although nifty gadgets like talking cereal boxes and vertical freeways abound Spielberg says ""This is not about special effects. I didnt want to make a big summer popcorn action movie. I couldnt make Indiana Jones with Dicks dark premises underneath. Why cant the future feel like a dark alley?"" Spielberg denies that his somewhat cynical tone is an echo of his (or Cruises) earlier collaborations with Stanley Kubrick. ""Stanleys been an influence since I was 17"" Spielberg says. ""But Im paying homage to John Hustons The Maltese Falcon Howard Hawkss The Big Sleep and Alfred Hitchcock in North by Northwest."" For his part Cruise is thrilled to work with one of his idols a collaboration which took twenty years to happen. ""After Risky Business Steven and I talked about working together someday"" Cruise says. ""We came close on Rain Man but when I sent him this story I knew this was it.""-- BEN KAPLAN Now playing  Showtimes amp; tickets (movietickets.com) Photo by ILM Twentieth Century Fox and Dreamworks LLC.

"At the Movies Minority Report 062102 - The Augusta Chronicle Augusta Chronicle   | CC News Times   | Augusta.com   | Augusta Real Estate   | Augusta Autos   | Augusta Jobs   | Apartment Finder Site Web At the Movies Minority Report By Christy Lemire| Associated Press Friday June 21 2002 If Steven Spielberg dipped his toe in the dark pool last year with ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" he dives in headfirst with ""Minority Report."" Despite the films heavy subject matter - its lack of faith in the criminal justice system its Orwellian issues of privacy its questioning of the nature of free will - ""Minority Report"" is a thrilling sensory overload a detailed fully realized world thats repeatedly and delightfully surprising. Spielberg doesnt delve these issues too deeply preferring to revel in his futuristic universe with its endless urban sprawl gee-whiz gadgets and sleek sports cars youll want two of for yourself. The film has an energy thats frightening and addictive. It weakens substantially toward the end though when it tries to shift focus to human beings experiencing a palpable sense of grief. Coming from Spielberg whos made his name with films that tug at the heart while dazzling the eye its unusual that this movie fails to register emotionally. But we havent gotten to know John Anderton (Tom Cruise) and his ex-wife Lara (Kathryn Morris) well enough to care when they struggle with the past and ponder a future. The year is 2054 and Anderton is chief of the Justice Departments Pre-Crime unit where a trio of ""pre-cogs"" - humans with psychic powers - see crimes before they happen in Washington D.C. Officers swoop down in helicopters and arrest suspects for acts they havent committed yet. Ambitious young FBI investigator Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell who more than holds his own with Cruise) steps in to ask questions about the Pre-Crime unit just as its on the verge of going nationwide through the influence of its director Lamar Burgess (Max Von Sydow). Anderton has invested all his time and energy into the unit since the disappearance six years ago of his son whos presumed dead and the breakup with his wife. But then the pre-cogs see him commit a murder forcing him to go on the run with his own team of officers chasing him. Anderton doesnt even know the man hes supposedly going to kill and assumes Witwer is trying to frame him. He has 36 hours to prove his innocence with the help of Agatha (a chilling Samantha Morton) the strongest of the pre-cogs. But if hes successful in changing the future it means the system to which hes devoted his life is flawed. Written by Scott Frank (who adapted Elmore Leonards ""Get Shorty"" and ""Out of Sight"") and first-timer Jon Cohen the film is based on science fiction writer Philip K. Dicks short story ""The Minority Report"" which first was published nearly 50 years ago. Traces of other movies adapted from Dicks writings are evident the nightmarish cityscapes of 1982s ""Blade Runner"" the ubiquitous video monitors of 1990s ""Total Recall."" But the look is very much that of Spielbergs recent films thanks to cinematographer Janusz Kaminski who also shot ""A.I."" and won Oscars for ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Schindlers List."" Its idyllic suburban images have an eerie undercurrent and everything is bathed in a smoky gray light as if someone left a batch of cookies in the oven too long. And the film wonderfully juxtaposes the old with the new. In Andertons stainless steel kitchen equipped with voice-activated appliances a half-empty wine bottle and leftover food sit on the counter; Pre-Crime officers chase suspects by flying through slums and alleys with jet packs strapped to their backs. Using his obvious star power Cruise plays the straight man here. He allows other actors to stand out in wild memorable supporting performances - namely Tim Blake Nelson as a boisterous corrections officer Lois Smith as an eccentric woman who inadvertently created the Pre-Crime system Peter Stormare as a sleazy underground eye surgeon and Jason Antoon as a tech geek at a sort of virtual Circuit City. For its stunning visuals and standout performances ""Minority Report"" - or at least the first three-fourths of it - might just be the best movie so far this year. A 20th Century Fox release ""Minority Report"" is rated PG-13 for violence brief language some sexuality and drug content. Running time 144 minutes. Three and a half stars (out of four).

Ferociously intense furiously kinetic its expressionist film noir science fiction that like all good sci-fi peers into the future to shed light on the present. The director couldnt have known when he and writers Scott Frank and Jon Cohen set about adapting Philip K. Dicks short story how uncannily their tale of 2054 Washington D.C. would resonate in the current political climate where our jails fill up with suspects whove been arrested for crimes they havent yet committed.The ""Pre-Crime"" unit in this future D.C. boasts that it has reduced the murder rate to zero. Its system depends on three psychic ""Pre-Cogs"" who can project images of crimes just before they happen. Chief Tom Anderton (Tom Cruise) is the first to see these images. Its his job to decode the information as quickly as possible locate the site of the crime and rush with his armed team to prevent the murder. Just how this works is illustrated in the spectacular opening sequence in which a jealous husband threatens his unfaithful wife with scissors.With an initiative on the ballot to take the Pre-Crime system national and an arrogant Justice Department investigator (Colin Farrell) snooping around for flaws Anderton is under pressure to demonstrate the Pre-Cogs infallibility. His passionate belief in what he does is fueled by personal tragedy the kidnapping of his son which destroyed his marriage and still drives him secretly to illicit drugs. But hes not hallucinating when the Pre-Cogs finger him as a future killer. Anderton doesnt even know the man hes supposedly going to kill. Suddenly hes on the run hunted by his own team with 36 hours to figure out if hes been framed. Could the Pre-Cogs be wrong? Or if he is a murderer does he have the power to reverse his fate? ""Minority Report"" is a thriller confident and complex enough to mix mayhem with meditations on predestination and free will. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week The world ""Minority Report"" evokes is a remarkable fusion of futurism and funk vertical highways that look like waterfalls spilling magnetized cars; billboard ads that give passing consumers a personal pitch (WELCOME TO THE GAP MR. YAMAMOTO). But the mean streets are as forbidding as anything in a 40s film noir. The grisly sequence in which Cruise visits a sinister underworld surgeon (Peter Stormare) to get a new set of eyes--shot and lit like something from Orson Welless ""Touch of Evil""-- is as dark as anything Spielberg has done. Janusz Kaminskis gritty cinematography bleaches out the colors enveloping the characters in a milky aura of cold light. ""Minority Report"" is an object lesson in the use of computer-generated special effects they dazzle without ever distracting you from the story.Spielberg uses Cruise well too exploiting his coiled athleticism while reining in his urge toward overexplicit angst. Its Cruises most potent action performance. Samantha Morton is haunting as the nightmare-ridden Pre-Cog Agatha who holds the clue to the riddle our hero must solve. The ageless Max von Sydow is in fine form as Andertons avuncular boss and in a sharp cameo as the creator of the Pre-Crime system Lois Smith manages to be both maternal and menacing.The movie is long (144 minutes) but it never loses its tension. The last act throws twist after twist at you. These are clever yet the more ""Minority Report"" focuses on mere plot the more conventional it feels. As with many mysteries the solution seems mundane compared with the riddle. But if the greatness promised in the first hour isnt sustained its unlikely youll see a thriller as exciting and provocative this year.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Comments Minority Report Completed the same month Joseph McCarthy was censured by the U.S. Senate Philip K. Dicks paranoid sci-fi story ""The Minority Report"" posits a future in which prophets wired to a supercomputer enable the cops to bust people for crimes they havent yet committed. To a nation that wants potential terrorists detained indefinitely this premise might not seem as dystopian as the filmmakers seem to think but Steven Spielberg has turned the material into a highly effective thriller whose futuristic panoramas rival those of A.I. Artificial Intelligence. Tom Cruise plays a police chief who considers the ""precrime"" system infallible until hes fingered for a future murder and has to prove his innocence. The first 15 minutes are masterful as Cruise hunts down a killer-to-be; the last 30 are mediocre as screenwriters Scott Frank and Jon Cohen untangle the mystery theyve grafted onto Dicks story. In between lies a conventional but expertly realized cop-on-the-run drama incorporating elements of The Matrix (a subterranean detention center where people are filed away like manila folders) Mission Impossible (a high-speed chase on a vertical freeway) Blade Runner (some biting satire of consumer culture) and 2001 A Space Odyssey (the star-child image of clairvoyant Samantha Morton). With Colin Farrell and Max von Sydow. 148 min. By J.R. Jones Now Playing Sorry there are no upcoming showtimes for Minority Report Reviews/comments Subscribe to this thread By Email Subscribing...

The units chief Anderton (Cruise) has his own reasons for supporting the scheme and its advocate Burgess (von Sydow) against sceptics like Witwer (Farrell) sent by the Attorney General to see if the nation should adopt the citys policy. But then something makes Anderton think again during transmission of a strangers imminent death he recognises the killer - himself. Can Pre-Cogs be wrong? Hopes were high for Spielbergs film adapted from a Philip K Dick story and blessed with a top technical crew and hot actors to bolster Tom. The first hour is promising. Despite ostentatious obfuscating gadgetry jargon and product placement; its fairly persuasive as a future-projection. But thereafter ideas are mostly cast aside so that Cruise can run leap kick ass and look anxious but determined as cliches multiply around him. The fashionably fussy funky veneer may convince some that the films serious but its finally another chase pic murky in detail muddled in ideology and strangely predictable in dramatic thrust.

"Lip-Reading Her Way Through An Ingenious French Thriller | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Style amp; Design Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Lip-Reading Her Way Through An Ingenious French Thriller By Andrew Sarris  07/15/02 1200am Jacques Audiards Read My Lips ( Sur Mes Levres ) from a screenplay by Mr. Audiard and Tonino Benacquista changes genres in midstream to transform a low-voltage love story involving two likable misfits into a high-stakes thriller loaded with fear passion courage suspense and ingenuity. It is just about the best movie I have seen this year and I dread thinking how the inevitable American remake with Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz or Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan will manage to mangle its magnificently original concept. The film opens with a detailed close-up introduction to Carla Bhem (Emmanuelle Devos) a deaf office worker with a hearing aid and an uncanny ability to read lips at great distances. She is employed by a construction company in a vaguely defined half-secretarial half-managerial position. One day she faints at the office from the strain of cleaning up after her many incompetent superiors. She then accepts her employers offer of an assistant she can hire as an intern to help her with her workload. When Paul Angeli (Vincent Cassel) arrives from the employment office Carla quickly ascertains that he is an ex-con without office skills and indeed with few social graces. Still he is enough of a hunk for her to shield him from her colleagues. Alone Carla and Paul are certified losers but together they make a surprisingly efficient team first in the office and later in a daring heist from mobsters. Carla has a curious mix of tactical instincts and shy unassertiveness that leads her to watch life rather than live it. For his part Paul has been beaten down by society but still has enough sly audacity to organize a revenge against his loan-shark nemesis. Their first successful collaboration results when Carla persuades Paul to steal a file from one of her unscrupulous co-workers. Paul is hesitant because he is on parole and has no desire to go back to prison. He is also a little shocked to discover how close to crime so-called ""honest"" business activity tends to drift. When Carla finds a way for Paul to keep working for her while paying off an old debt to a loan shark by working in a mob-owned night club Paul assumes that she wants to sleep with him and he is willing to repay her kindness with the only currency at his disposal. When she rebuffs his advances he is genuinely mystified. What does she want or expect? In this love story without sex until the final fade-out Paul and Carla have many stormy moments in their relationship but every time they seem about to part permanently the next shot finds them doing one anothers bidding. Mr. Audiards previous films See How They Fall (1994) and A Self-Made Hero (1995) celebrated masculine virtues and vices in the violent worlds of crime and war. Read My Lips combines masculine and feminine in a wildly original fusion of distinctive temperaments and skills. Carlas ""disability"" for example enables her to cash in literally on her compensatory ability to read lips. Paul repeatedly calls her a bitch and on some levels she is exactly that but on other levels she is heartbreakingly vulnerable without ever sinking into self-pity. She has learned to live with the fact that she is not a babe. What I like most about the movie is the absence of any portentous back story for either Carla or Paul. Their characters are forged in the crucible of contingency as they respond to one dangerous challenge after another without the benefit of any prior experience. To watch Carla read lips through binoculars while perched on a cold roof or Paul hurling ice cubes into whiskey glasses as if he had been bartending all his life is to be plunged into a physical adventure in which our two protagonists are reborn every moment. And all around them is a chorus of anger and anguish from the betrayed and the deceived most memorably the parole officer Masson (Olivier Perrier) with a heart-rending secret he knowingly confides at a distance to Carlas lip-reading eyes. There are absolutely no caricatures to be seen and comfortably ridiculed. The delights are in the details. Mr. Audiard and his crew have found so many different ways to illuminate the feelings of their characters that it may take more than one viewing to fully appreciate the subtleties of the sounds and images. Ms. Devos and Mr. Cassel have been in more movies than most American viewers will ever see. Actors believe in the work ethic over there and the good ones try to vary their personae as much as possible from film to film. As often as I have seen Ms. Devos and Mr. Cassel in the past I cannot recall ever having been so overwhelmed by their creative intensity. Read My Lips is to be viewed and treasured for its extraordinary intelligence and originality as well as its lyrical variations on the game of love. Minority Report Sinks Too Low Steven Spielbergs Minority Report  from a screenplay by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen based upon a short story by Phillip K. Dick plays for most of its running time like a John Ashcroft wet dream but in the last minutes it chickens out with an American Civil Liberties Union-approved ending full of pardons and second thoughts. Tom Cruise gives one of his most inconsistent and incoherent performances as Chief John Anderton of the elite Department of Pre-Crime in Washington D.C. circa 2054. Just think of it Murder has been banished from the nations capital because the guilty are punished before their crimes are committed. At one time or another Anderton is a bereaved father sobbing over his murdered child and a Toscanini of mumbo-jumbo hand gestures summoning future crime to virtual reality and then apprehending and imprisoning the criminals before they have committed the crimes. Then lest the kids begin yawning during the tediously expository dialogue Anderton turns into a superspeedy fugitive from justice outrunning outwitting and outmuscling a horde of Pre-Crime troopers in the silliest chase scenes in movie history. Colleagues I respect and even admire have written rave reviews for Minority Report . My own minority report is that it stinks and I would leave it at that if it were not for my embarrassing admiration for Mr. Spielbergs A.I. Artificial Intelligence last year. ""Embarrassing"" only because Im supposed to be a registered auteurist from way back. It is not that I am particularly disappointed in Mr. Spielberg for making Minority Report . I have been considerably less than enthralled by most of his films over the years and yet I have always understood why mine was often a minority position on his career. Lately some critics have been condescendingly describing him as a Kubrick without cojones  which is to overlook Kubricks frequent descents into sentimentality and infantilism however diluted with vinegar. At their best though not necessarily most popular both directors-Kubrick with The Shining (1980) and the first part of Full Metal Jacket (1987) Mr. Spielberg with Empire of the Sun (1987) and A.I. (2001)-have displayed an ability to confound their juvenile constituency with an expression of psychological maturity. By contrast Minority Report sinks to the level of pornographically violent video games such as Grand Theft Auto with some ghoulish surgery involving switched eyeballs guaranteed to titillate the tots. Indeed the films vaunted Pre-Crime technology ends up looking like little more than a peculiarly shaped pinball machine. The incongruities of mixing futuristic environments with defiantly retro costuming are supposed to be amusing. In this respect the curious publicity campaign to promote Irish Russell Crowe-like rogue actor Colin Farrell as the new Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt heartthrob is sabotaged by the sanitized American-accented version of Mr. Farrell in a vintage F.B.I. business suit circa 1950. I wont go into the holes in the plot because Swiss-cheese narratives are supposedly part of the postmodern idiom but I did wonder idly why Anderton seemed to lose interest in the fate of his son by the final fade-out. It struck me also that casting mordant Max Von Sydow as the head honcho gave the show away much too early. Jacquots Tosca Soars Benoit Jacquots Tosca  from Giacomo Puccinis opera varies the usual procedures for transposing operas to film by having the three major singers often play their scenes close-lipped with their off-screen arias serving as interior monologues. The opera itself more than any work by Puccini lends itself to an economical mise en scene of architectural grandeur with its three majestic settings one for each act first with the SaintAndrea della Valle Church second with the Palazzo Farnese and third with the Castel SantAngelo. Angela Gheorghiu as famous prima donna Floria Tosca Roberto Alagna as her lover Mario Cavaradossi and Ruggero as the villainous lecherous police chief Scarpia all sing beautifully and act adequately bringing Tosca to cinematic life. Not that it matters all that much. If you love Puccini as much as I do you can close your eyes to all of Mr. Jacquots imaginative innovations and still thrill to the music. If Puccini leaves you cold youd better off rushing to see Men in Black II . There is no middle ground here. Ethnic Extravaganza Joel Zwicks My Big Fat Greek Wedding  from a screenplay by Nia Vardalos based on her stand-up show about growing up Greek has lasted as one of the most talked-about audience sleepers of the year. Its broad ethnic humor does not offend even Greek-Americans largely I think because of the attractive intelligence of Ms. Vardalos as she widens her eyes over her familys shenanigans without ever suggesting that she is in any way ashamed of her Greek heritage. Consequently there are no lasting bite marks from the ethnic exaggerations. If anyone were to be offended by My Big Fat Greek Wedding  it would have to be the WASPs who here sit still for every Greek-American imposition on their good natures. John Corbetts Ian Miller allows himself to be humiliated in an invasive Greek Orthodox baptism ceremony not so much to satisfy Ms. Vardalos Toula Portokalos as to appease her anguished family. Millers parents Harriet (Fiona Reid) and Rodney (Bruce Gray) are treated even more disrespectfully with the final indignity being the misprinting of ""Harriet"" as ""Harry"" on the wedding invitations. As a witness to several Greek-American weddings-but happily a victim of none-I can testify to the comparative accuracy of Ms. Vardalos memories and insights. We are a crazy people with much more history than geography and we are not nearly as lovable as American tourists as My Big Fat Greek Wedding would suggest. See Metropolis  Now Fritz Langs Metropolis (1927) from a screenplay by Lang and Thea von Harbou is being released by Kino International in a ""digital restoration"" version to celebrate the 75th anniversary of this seminal classic inspired by a visit Lang made to New York in the 20s. Catch it wherever and whenever it plays. It incarnates the idea of the Big City as a manifestation of modernism.

In the shallow noisy and pretentious Minority Report  we have seen the future. Its not pretty. There are two Steven Spielbergs. One is the cinematic historian who instructs informs and shapes a universal consciousness that makes us aware of our stake in the human race in masterpieces like Schindlers List and Saving Private Ryan . The other is a 12-year-old comic-book collector weaned on sci-fi and stuck in the twilight zone of his own nursery who turns out polished but moronic time-wasters about dinosaurs space ships Indiana Jones and Peter Pan. Quel doppelganger . I always have a hard time believing the same man capable of both greatness ( The Color Purple ) and trash ( Jurassic Park ). Occasionally a film like E.T. or Raiders of the Lost Ark emerges to meld the technical proficiency of the craftsman with the passion of the storyteller. Bloody violent cold and preposterous Minority Report is not one of them. Despite an astronomical budget and a gallimaufry of twists and turns enhanced by special effects Minority Report has a boring one-dimensional story line you could write on one page of Big Chief tablet paper with a No. 2 lead pencil. Derived from a story by sci-fi spinmaster Philip K. Dick (the man responsible for Blade Runner ) its set in Washington D.C. in 2054. Crime has been wiped out thanks to an experimental Pre-Crime Unit called a ""priori"" developed by wacko scientist Max von Sydow that can predict murders before they happen. Tom Cruise plays Detective John Anderton the futuristic cop in charge of preventing homicides with the aid of three psychic visionaries called ""Pre-Cogs"" who float around in a liquid wading pool wired drugged and having nightmares. Waving his arms like Leonard Bernstein in the orchestra pit Anderton can download images of clues suspects and crime scenes then lead his futuristic crimebusters to the killers before they pull the trigger. With beady eyes flexed jaw and a buzz cut hes a man whose life is already so haunted by the abduction and murder of his only son that he looks and acts creepier than the Pre-Cogs. The world has apparently survived John Ashcroft because the Justice Department thinks the Pre-Crime Unit is too controversial a concept to go national. In a subplot that goes nowhere Irish hunk Colin Farrell is wasted as the dull F.B.I. investigator from the Attorney Generals office who covets Andertons job. The lulling narrative drones on until the tables turn and Anderton is named by the Pre-Cogs as the next murderer. From here the movie turns from a whodunit into a wholl-do-it as the flawed hero (hes hooked on drugs) has 36 hours to solve his own case and clear his name by breaking into the Pre-Crime lab and downloading the info from the Pre-Cog who predicted it-and Mr. Spielberg sweats it all out stretching the films playing time to two hours plus. Mr. Cruise who barely survived Vanilla Sky  one of the worst movies ever made bares his teeth and pecs in a variation of the same role he played in that fiasco-a man driven insane by a technological bad dream. Not much of a stretch there and the techno-gibberish about ""Pre-Cog echoes"" and ""prevision data bases"" spouted with a terminally pained expression from the ludicrous script by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen almost flattens him. Meanwhile Mr. Spielberg pours on the gore. In one scene the star has his eyeballs surgically removed because in the future we are told identity searches scan only eyes. (Gee whatever happened to fingerprints?) Carrying around those Tom Cruise eyes in a plastic bag as a sentimental keepsake he drops one retina through the cracks of a drain while the other one hangs by its bloody optical nerves. Not a movie for anyone considering corrective Lasik procedures or even changing contact lenses. Also not a movie where acting counts. Samantha Morton with a shaved head has an out-of-body experience as the Pre-Cog who disagrees with the others (this is called a ""minority report""). Tim Blake Nelson plays the fiend who contains all of the killers rapists and psychos from the past in data pods. The marvelous Lois Smith who steals her brief scenes with relish as a horticulturist who holds the secrets to the minority reports is nutty as a pecan pie. But the characters arent human enough to be real or metaphorical enough to be comic caricatures. In the end they are all upstaged by the macabre effects created by production designer Alex McDowell that make the whole movie look as though it was staged inside a stainless-steel paint bucket. When in doubt bring on the gimmicks. Mr. Spielberg complies showing off the latest stunts tricks and toys as distractions far more interesting than the movie itself. Futuristic subway riders reading digital newspapers in which the headlines change between stops. Cops flying through space between skyscrapers like Superman in magnetic-levitation cars. Angry trees that grab you like the nasty apple orchard in The Wizard of Oz  injecting a poison that can only be cured by a foul-tasting brewed tea. Animatronic spiders slithering through walls and floorboards to identify suspects by shining a light in their eyes. Loopily cinematic Mr. Spielberg the practical joker even stages a chase scene in a Gap store. Some things never change. Niche filmmaking will obviously still plague us in 2054 and so will the serious unsettling questions it raises but fails to answer. Why is it that the visions of the Pre-Cogs never extend beyond Washington D.C.? How will the Orwellian effect of the new technology invade privacy and affect civil rights? If the Pre-Cogs see different images how can you prove a crime is going to happen beyond a reasonable doubt? In the ideological confusion the film loses its credibility and raises more legal social and political questions than it can handle. Mr. Cruise gets lost in the stew like a carrot. He looks like hell and goes through hell to earn his millions but in Minority Report hes just a small black hole at the center of an even bigger black hole. An Irresistible Romp in Williamstown In the present confused national climate the august and highly esteemed Williamstown Theatre Festival has kicked off its 48th summer season on the leafy campus of Williams College with a splendid production of Wheres Charley?  a buoyant frolic with nothing on its mind but entertainment. From now to June 30 a stress-free environment is guaranteed that will put a smile on your face and keep it there. New Yorkers are flocking there in droves. Wheres Charley?  the first Broadway musical by Frank Loesser won a Tony Award for Ray Bolger in 1949 and repeated its success in a 1952 movie that turned the song ""Once in Love with Amy"" into a national obsession. But wheres Charley now? The movie has never to my knowledge been shown on TV and the stage musical remains much revered but rarely produced. Williamstown has remedied all that with the kind of fun-filled romp that comes at a time when were desperately in need of one. The one-joke plot is about Charley the popular but prankish Oxford rake who frantically dons the bombazine and graying curls of his millionaire aunt Donna Lucia DAlvadorez from Brazil (""Where the nuts come from"") so that Amy the girl of his dreams will have a proper chaperone during her visits to his college rooms. Charleys roommate Jack is besotted by Amys friend Kitty and both girls think the boys are hiding an older woman when Charleys real aunt shows up pursued by Jacks penniless father; meanwhile Charley in drag is being stalked by the awful Mr. Spettigue Amys fortune-hunting guardian. Throw in some mistaken identities quick changes in closets and behind ivy walls and everyone dashing madly about trilling ""Wheres Charley?"" and much chaos ensues. Even as dated college musicals go Wheres Charley? grows the corn higher than the proverbial elephants eye. George Abbotts book has been trimmed for the Williamstown production which is staged with the speed of a breakneck burlesque by the brilliant director Nicholas Martin. And in the role of Charley the legitimate stage has found a formidable new star in the rubber-faced clown Christopher Fitzgerald. He doesnt have Ray Bolgers libidinous legs but he sings and dances with wild abandon and recreates Bolgers audience sing-along on ""Once in Love with Amy"" with showstopping charm. Camouflaging the corn with stylized characterizations period costumes nimble choreography and James Noones trompe loeil sets of indigo skies and kelly green topiaries director Martin has created a farcical cartoon of endless delights. This isnt easy with a stage that is in itself an obstacle course of trap doors and raked walkways with the orchestra pit in a hole in the middle of the proscenium. Its a miracle the entire cast doesnt end up performing in leg casts and Ace bandages. Was the world ever this innocent and carefree? Dont everybody answer at once. But even when your eyebrows rise with incredulity you will find the Frank Loesser score irresistible. I had forgotten how much I missed ""My Darling My Darling"" or the Sousa-inspired ""New Ashmolean Marching Society and Students Conservatory Band."" Its a pleasure to rediscover the obscure Loesser ballad ""Lovelier Than Ever"" and Amys hilarious comic aria ""The Woman in His Room"" triumphantly performed by the enchanting Jessica Stone who looks like Tweety Pie and belts like a cross between Betty Boop and Betty Hutton. For the bumbling seduction scene between the pompous old windbag Spettigue and the hapless befuddled Charley in drag an actual Betty Hutton song called ""Why Fight the Feeling"" from the Frank Loesser film score for Lets Dance  has been happily added. In the riotous tea-pouring scene where to his horror Charley uses his top hat as a cream pitcher the veteran trouper Paxton Whitehead-who once enthralled audiences on the Williamstown stage as an unforgettable Sherlock Holmes -is a knockout as the greedy malevolent Spettigue. Distinguished by the customary high standards for which it was awarded this years Tony Award for excellence in regional theater Williamstown has opened its 2002 season with a fireworks display. In the smaller Nikos adjacent to the main stage I also saw a smashing production of the British import Under the Blue Sky  directed by John Erman with electrifying star turns by Marsha Mason and Annabella Sciorra. The rest of the summer program which ends Aug. 25 includes four world premieres by such established playwrights as Eric Bogosian Cheryl L. West Dan OBrien and Alfred ( Driving Miss Daisy ) Uhry as well as a new play from Canada starring Olympia Dukakis a forgotten classic from the Yiddish theater by Sholem Asch and established works by George Kaufman and Moss Hart Joe Orton and Tennessee Williams. If Wheres Charley? is any indication the tone is set for a bracing frozen cosmo of a summer.

With Tom Cruise Samantha Morton Colin Farrell Max von Sydow. Directed by Steven Spielberg. Running time 143 mins. Rated R Violence language sexuality drugs. 2 1/2 Stars. Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise were among the last to work with the late Stanley Kubrick - Spielberg on ""A.I."" a project he finished on his own and Cruise on Kubricks final movie ""Eyes Wide Shut."" In a bit of real-life science fiction pieces of Kubricks brain appear to have lodged in those of his two acolytes. The result is ""Minority Report"" by turns silly and amazing a mishmash of Kubrickian devices accompanied by a steady Spielbergian drip of sentimentality. It will undoubtedly do better than ""A.I."" whose philosophical conundrums were too unpleasant for viewers to contemplate. ""Minority Report"" is more accessibly superficial. Based on a short story by Philip K. Dick the movie is set in 2054 when everything is known. Retinal scans are like human bar codes so that an individuals every step and spending habit is tracked. Electronic ads heckle you to buy buy buy. Its a triumph not of technology but of consumerism. Even the future is known. In a ""RoboCop""-like experiment in crime prevention three ""pre-cogs"" - ethereal humans with the ability to predict the future - float in amniotic-like fluid at the center of Washingtons ""Department of Containment."" Samantha Morton in yet another nearly wordless role (following Woody Allens ""Sweet and Lowdown"") plays the most expressive of the trio. The pre-cogs dream fitfully of murders to come squeezing their thoughts out onto memory chips and inscribed balls that roll down chutes like lottery numbers. A special task force examines this ""evidence"" then fans out through the city and captures killers who have not even had time to load the chamber. In some of the films faint stabs at religious iconography the guilty party is cuffed with a halo a kind of penal-system lobotomy for the social good. The finest of these cops is John Anderton (Cruise). Hes cop lawyer and maestro rolled into one. Wearing futurist game gloves hes able to sort and sweep the pre-cog images on a screen conducting an orchestra of justice. But hes not a happy man. While offduty he torments himself by toking on a drug-delivery system that resembles an asthma inhaler while replaying sunny holographic home movies of the perfect life he led before his son disappeared and his wife left him. In a classic film-noir plot line John must solve a crime to save his own skin. The pre-cogs have ordained that John will commit a murder and he has to work a split second ahead of his own department led by a colleague he never liked anyway (Colin Farrell a heartthrob in the making). Even his old mentor (Max von Sydow) cant help him as he races the clock. Vertiginous chase scenes are thrillingly unexpected and the look of this gadgetized hologramed future is rapturously captured by cinematographer Janusz Kaminski with a blue-gray acid wash a continuation of what he did with Spielberg on ""A.I."" And yet the persistence of that look plus the numbingly overstuffed frame reaches a tipping point. Much of ""Minority Report"" is inspired but the movie is also packed with oddball overdone acting the occasional clunker cliche and the feeling that Spielberg couldnt leave well enough alone. A truly horrific back-alley surgical scene is undercut by a Mel Brooks moment an amorous nurse with a man-eating birthmark. And its way too easy to guess the movies villain. The most striking moments are remnants of the great Kubrick Johns eyes clamped open ... la ""A Clockwork Orange"" allusions to ""The Shining"" etc. Kubricks movies were cerebral and chilly and mordantly funny but Spielberg cant help trying to warm the heart particularly when introducing father-son motifs. Whenever the sap begins to flow as in all Spielberg movies it must the movie begins to sag.

Minority Report is a fabulous witty totalitarian nightmare. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 21 2002 114 PM Blame Runner Minority Report is a fabulous witty totalitarian nightmare. By David Edelstein Tom Cruise and Samantha Morton testing fate For slightly under two hours Steven Spielbergs Minority Report (DreamWorks/20th Century Fox) is even greater than the sum of its parts--a roller coaster in which the loop-the-loops are philosophical as well as visceral. Its one of the drollest projections of the future ever put on film. The movie is adapted from an early short story by Philip K. Dick; and while it strays from Dicks narrative it nails the basic premise and some quintessential Dickian motifs. The year is 2054 and in and around Washington D.C. murder has been eliminated by a private corporation with governmentlike powers of detention. The company Precrime has developed technology to tap into the minds of ""Pre-Cogs"" psychic humans who float in a sort of sacred amniotic pool their synapses wired to video terminals. What they visualize and what shows up on screens in the companys control room are not ""thought crimes"" but crimes that definitely will be committed. Sounds invasive no? Shrewdly the screenplay (by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen) adds a cliffhanger aspect to engage our sympathies. With crimes of passion the Pre-Cogs vision can come mere minutes before a murder is destined to occur which means a race to discern the location and stop the killing. While his hovercraft SWAT team waits to swoop down on the perpetrator-to-be the unit chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise) reviews the Pre-Cogs tapes on a giant glass screen like some sort of forensic Leonard Bernstein commanding the computer to shift the grid try different angles and zoom in for close-ups. Anderton also has a direct video link to a pair of judges who by rote give their legal blessing to go forth and apprehend. Advertisement I must admit that I find elements of this future attractive--and so according to MinorityReport does the populace of 2054. A political advertisement for Precrime is stunningly effective It shows people who would have been murder victims expressing gratitude for their lives. As the movie begins Precrime is on the verge of a referendum that would make its policies the law of the United States and a smirky Justice Department honcho called Witwer (Colin Farrell) has arrived to scrutinize the companys inner workings--to ensure that the data that sends would-be culprits into suspended animation for the rest of their lives is reliable. The movie presents us with a classic totalitarian trade-off upgraded by technology and the paranormal Would you surrender a slew of civil liberties for a world without crime? Assuming that the right people were always jailed for the right reasons Id think about it long and hard. The hero Anderton doesnt have to think too hard. He has a vigilantes worldview and a fanatical loyalty to Precrime director Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow). A drug user and fantasist Anderton spends most of his spare time with his holographic home movies reliving the life he once led with his wife and young son the latter abducted and (presumably) killed a mere six months before Precrime came into existence. Six months earlier and hed still have a family Nothing can come between Anderton and his Precrime religion--nothing that is until the Pre-Cogs have a vision of him killing a man he has never heard of until the entire apparatus of the company is turned toward apprehending the former apprehender. The idea that an individual could have a hidden life that even he doesnt know about is pure Dick and it gives the suspense an extra kink. Unlike the heroes of most blockbuster thrillers Anderton isnt simply running away from special effects; hes running toward his future. Hes trying to learn the identity of the man hes fated to murder--to prove that he wont commit the crime that with knowledge he can change the future that even in a universe with Pre-Cogs no ones actions are predestined. The search leads him back to the Pre-Cogs he regarded as both holy and subhuman Theyre like floating star-children hairless in a druggy state of suspension. The one he abducts Agatha (Samantha Morton) has never lived in the present only the twilit world of other peoples futures. Morton comes with her own lyrically disconnected aura. She cant move too fast but a Pre-Cog proves a handy thing to have in a chase. You know whats going to trip you up a minute or so down the road. It has been a long time since a Spielberg film felt so nimble so unfettered so free of self-cannibalizing. When he sheds his pandering mannerisms he really is one of the most wittily dexterous filmmakers alive and he gets a fine focused performance from Cruise whos better when you cant spot him acting. Spielberg was gun-for-hire on Minority Report (Cruises company developed the project) but nothing feels impersonal. Having publicly taken issue with his old friend George Lucas paeans to digital video Spielberg makes a passionate case for celluloid. Janusz Kaminskis palette is cool desaturated blue-washed with a grainy texture suggesting the unstable molecules of reality. Digital video is the instrument of the state of Precrime of the corporation Its a world in which marketers identify you with a retinal scan and tailor billboards to your purchases (an extension of Amazons technique of greeting you ""personally"" with a list of recommendations based on books youve bought before). Precrime tracks with retinal scans too. Theres an amazing sequence--a showstopper--in which a team in search of Anderton dispatches a horde of mechanical spiders into a fleabag hotel the robot insects skittering from room to room crawling under doors lasering the eyeballs of the buildings inhabitants. This script is so smart and the editing (by Michael Kahn) so crackerjack that every freaky black-comic element works like gangbusters. Take the squirmily funny scene in which an underground surgeon (Peter Stormare)--a druggie sadist--gives Anderton a new set of eyeballs but not before taunting him with his defenselessness Its a Saturday Night Live sketch in hell. As the reclusive Dr. Iris Hineman the inventor of the Precrime technology Lois Smith manages to be forward and evasive in the same instant--a hilariously discomfiting combination. It is Hineman who lets slip the existence of ""minority reports""--alternate Pre-Cog visions of the future that are swiftly suppressed for fear of undercutting the cases against people who as yet havent actually done anything. This thread of Minority Report has prompted lively commentary from Dahlia Lithwicks deft comparison to the Jose Padilla case to Jeremy Lotts provocative assertion that the movie will be to the Bush administration what Wag the Dog was to the Clinton team--a crystalline metaphor for political expediency. But neither Lithwick nor Lott has seen the film and Im sorry to report that unlike Dicks story it doesnt stick with that idea and develop it. In fact the minority report becomes the casualty of the last 20 minutes which play more like a third-rate episode of Murder She Wrote than anything by Philip K. Dick. I cant believe that the same screenwriters who fashioned the first two hours had anything to do with the scene between von Sydow and Andertons estranged wife played by Kathryn Morris who emerges from nowhere to save the day. Whose idea was it to turn Minority Report into a mushy declaration of humanism? It ends up as less of a warning about an Orwellian police state than a protest that Pre-Cogs are people too. Its Dick-less. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

"Minority Report a Thriller for the Majority washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Minority Report a Thriller for the Majority Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 21 2002 LETS PRETEND the over-explanatory conclusion of ""Minority Report"" doesnt exist. That way I can tell you the latest Steven Spielberg movie featuring Tom Cruise (or is it the latest Tom Cruise picture featuring Steven Spielberg?) is the very model of a summer sci-fi thriller. Its a mystery ? as in whos the dark presence behind all this? ? but its not too difficult to figure out. It has an incredibly sleek look in terms of cinematography editing and production design. And theres just enough of that Philip K. Dick feel (his short story inspired the screenplay) to lend artistic class (but dont worry multiplex denizens not too much) to the story. Of course it has the high-dollar presence of Mr. Cruise whose intensity and muscle definition should inspire theater lines at least until ""Men in Black II."" The movies set in Washington in 2054 a futuristic metropolis where the elite Pre-Crime unit has been operating for six years. Under the control of the soft-spoken Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow) the unit is a fascinating composite of classic and cutting edge. Its sophisticated techno-lab is informed by a 21st-century-style Oracle at Delphi an immersion tank where three psychics known as ""Pre-Cogs"" lie in a liquid suspension chamber their brains (and all their visions) hot-wired to the mainframe. Chief John Anderton (Cruise) and a SWAT team of airborne detectives use this Pre-Cog intelligence to bust would-be killers before they commit their murders. In most cases would-be murderers are arrested before they even know theyre about to take a life. The Pre-meditated homicide has abated because of this preventive technology but murders of passion continue. Anderton who processes the hologram-like data with the same swagger a certain bartender named Brian Flanagan displayed in ""Cocktail"" is on top of his game. Or so it seems. But when his Pre-Cog imagery shows him shooting someone dead in the near future he becomes an instant fugitive. Chased by his own unit and Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell a Fed who has taken over the investigation) Anderton reaches out to his sympathetic boss Burgess (I cant quite refer to the Swedish-born von Sydow as ""Lamar"") his estranged wife (Kathryn Morris) and Agatha (Samantha Morton) a sort of Joan-of-Arc psychic with a mystical divine look in her eyes. With the usual gifted team at his disposal ? including composer John Williams cinematographer Janusz Kaminski editor Michael Kahn and costume designer Deborah L. Scott ? Spielberg takes assured control. In his hands ""Minority Report"" is a classy chilly quasi-Hitchcockian affair. Theres at least one nod to ""Rear Window"" as an overhead camera pans across a building of open-view apartments showing its motley residents undergoing involuntary retina inspections by some scary metallic spiders. And at times Williamss score seems to reference Hitchcocks favorite composer Bernard Herrmann. Everyones too busy shooting firing running away or cajoling someone for information to get down and act. But thats another key component of the summer sci-fi thriller. Sudden death spectacular escapes and special effects (well integrated here) are the attractions. Acting isnt part of the fast-moving deal. After all the worlds in big trouble. And its going to take dedication and muscle definition not Shakespearean heft to save it. MINORITY REPORT (PG-13 140 minutes) ? Contains violence obscene language some sexuality and drug content. Area theaters.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Ann Hornaday June 21 2002 Follow AnnHornaday Steven Spielberg creates a ghastly frightening world in ""Minority Report"" a world light -- or rather dark -- years away from the honeyed allegories and adventures he made earlier in his career. Drawing on elements of the past and the future both of which have exerted a strong pull on the director over the years Spielberg seems to have given full rein to the pessimistic impulses that drove his last film the downbeat Oedipal fantasy ""A.I."" Based on a 1956 short story by Philip K. Dick ""Minority Report"" stars Tom Cruise as John Anderton a detective working in the Justice Department in the year 2054. He heads something called the Pre-Crime Unit in which three psychics predict crimes that havent happened yet. Anderton is the most gifted interpreter of their often horrifying visions which are transferred to a transparent computer screen that Anderton ""reads"" by waving his arms like a postmodern Toscanini. As the film opens the Pre-Crime Unit has so far operated only in Washington but the program is about to go national a prospect that Anderton anticipates with relish His own son was killed before the three precognitive beings or ""Pre-Cogs"" as theyre known were discovered to have crime-fighting capabilities. Haunted by his own role in his sons death and by the subsequent breakup of his marriage Anderton has become the lead proselytizer for Pre-Crime and he does his job with unalloyed zeal. (He has also become dependent on a street drug called Neuroin.) But his beliefs are shaken one day when one of the wooden balls on which the identities of future murderers are etched comes up with an unexpected name his. Most of ""Minority Report"" concerns the chase that ensues once Andertons colleagues learn that hes their new quarry. But as with any good thriller along the way Anderton discovers that he has a few shadowy unknown enemies. In order to escape them and clear his name he enlists some unlikely allies including an unscrupulous doctor (Peter Stormare) and the most psychically powerful of the Pre-Cogs Agatha (Samantha Morton). Although Spielberg and his screenwriters Jon Cohen and Scott Frank throw in some red herrings along the way viewers will catch on pretty quickly to the whys and wherefores of Andertons future crime. The fun in this movie isnt so much in solving its ever-unfolding mysteries but in appreciating the detail and imagination with which the filmmakers have constructed a not-so-distant future. That future is for the most part a fascinating and in some cases insidious elaboration on present-day conventions. Although Washingtons Mall has been left unmolested its verdant expanse is surrounded by a loop-de-loop of highways that work by magnetic levitation. Its a world of constant retinal scanning whereby peoples eyes are the windows not only to their souls but to their security clearance their legal status and most important their consumer preferences. One of the most sophisticated notions posited by ""Minority Report"" is that personal privacy will be violated and exploited by marketers far sooner than by the government. Still at a time when a new Cabinet post and federal department are being created solely to protect national security when an unknown number of detainees are being held by federal authorities without being charged and when progress in genetic testing far outstrips our ability to agree on its limits the present-day resonance of ""Minority Report"" cannot be denied. It might be a blessing that the film was finished before Sept. 11 It keeps polemics to a minimum focusing instead on the moral choices of individuals within the new realities created by technological progress. Spielberg who enlisted a think tank of scientists architects urban planners and writers to help imagine what 2054 would look like clearly has a good time with the gadgetry and gizmos of the future but he doesnt fetishize the technology Indeed he literally throws the effects away as when Anderton offhandedly tosses an animated cereal box over his shoulder in irritation. Instead the director seems more interested in re-creating the noir world of his favorite films of the 1940s with their slick streets and downcast mood. Working with cinematographer Janusz Kaminski Spielberg has made his grainiest film to date one in which the colors have been drained out of the actors faces and the smoke and gelid light seem to have been borrowed from a David Fincher movie. He is just as subversive with his megawatt star Cruise has never looked worse than in ""Minority Report"" in which his face is repeatedly gouged distorted and otherwise distressed. Even those 25 million baby blues are removed in a gruesome sequence that recalls Humphrey Bogarts plastic surgery in ""Dark Passage"" -- as well as Malcolm McDowells eye-opening experience in ""A Clockwork Orange"" by Stanley Kubrick Spielbergs collaborator on ""A.I."" At two hours-plus ""Minority Report"" is too saggy to qualify as a taut techno-thriller and many of its plot points dont withstand serious scrutiny or reflection. Not incidentally for a film that so slyly critiques the American marketing machine it engages in quite a bit of shilling itself Brand names such as Bulgari Lexus Reebok and Aquafina are tossed out like so many Reeses Pieces. Still there are small often amusing touches of whimsy in its speculations such as what yoga classes will look like 50 years hence and the scrabbling spiderlike robots that fan out to perform emergency retinal scans during a citywide search. Cruise proves himself a good sport as Spielberg puts him through the rigors of deconstructing his star persona Even the women in the movie have their way with him planting unwelcome smooches on his lips and squeezing his irresistible rear end. As always he delivers an energetic and focused performance but its Samantha Morton as Agatha who is most electrifying. As in Woody Allens ""Sweet and Lowdown"" she is silent throughout most of ""Minority Report"" but her expressive eyes and always-changing face eloquently convey the pain her character has channeled for so long. (At one point she is dressed in striped pants and an undershirt which with her thin frame and shaved head cant help but suggest the death camps Spielberg re-created to such harrowing effect in ""Schindlers List."") So where does ""Minority Report"" stand? As an adult summer movie it provides some provocative entertainment for those willing to stomach some of its more unsavory visual elements and grim story. As a futuristic thriller it is probably too conventional to rank as a cult classic on par with ""Blade Runner"" (also from a Dick story) and the intricacies of its plot dont add up to anything worth puzzling over. But as a Spielberg movie it is yet another installment in an artistic trajectory that has become much more interesting in the past decade. Spielbergs dark side may not be where everyone wants to live but its somehow encouraging to know that he has one. Minority Report (140 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for violence brief language some sexuality and drug content.

Directed by Steven Spielberg from a screenplay by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen based on a short story by Philip K. Dick. 145 minutes. Rated PG-13 for violence brief language some sexuality and drug content. Several theaters. Steven Spielbergs vision of the future in ""Minority Report"" set in the year 2054 is an intriguing blend of the familiar and the jarring. Fifty years hence people still live in charming brick houses listen to elevator-music mixes of ""Moon River"" at malls and shop for clothes that look suspiciously like those of 2002. Meanwhile cars have morphed into magnetic vehicles that scoot both horizontally and vertically advertisers target customers by scanning their eyes and back-alley doctors lurk to swap your eyeballs with somebody elses for a quick identity change. Its comforting somehow to think that technology may come and go but the jackets at the Gap stay the same. Not that much about ""Minority Report"" is intended to comfort; this is a dark threatening world shot in menacing indigo and gray tones by cinematographer Janusz Kaminski and edited with whiplash speed by Michael Kahn. The film bears some similarities to Spielbergs ""A.I."" -- both are dark depictions of the future; both are filled-out versions of short stories; both feature protagonists driven by the strength (or lack) of the parent-child bond. But ""Minority Report"" is more consistent and more likely to appeal to audiences; its not a classic but a very well-made thought-provoking genre film. Its easy to see what attracted Spielberg and star Tom Cruise. Philip K. Dicks 1956 short story on which the screenplay is based is a perfect little nail-biter that puts forth a fascinating notion that the future can be reliably glimpsed (in this case by three psychically gifted people known as ""pre-cogs"") and thus crime can be stopped before it starts. But within this notion is a lovely paradox -- the future isnt the future if you stop it -- and an alluring question What would you do if you knew that in 36 hours you would commit murder? The story focuses on John Anderton a cop dedicated to the Pre-Crime program in the Justice Department through which murders are prevented by interpreting data from pre-cogs. One day his own name turns up -- he will soon murder a stranger. Frantic to avoid his fate he learns that one of the pre-cogs may have ""misphased"" his data -- resulting in a dissenting ""minority report"" which must now be tracked down in order to clear his name. Its a terrific premise and Dick tells the story with bare-bones tension. Scott Frank and Jon Cohens adaptation takes the idea and runs with it adding backstory detail new characters and a rather melancholy happy ending. Like all Spielberg movies ""Minority Report"" is full of carefully thought-out detail -- Andertons work process as he interprets pre-cog data is an elegantly choreographed ballet of hand gesture and swooping arms (set wittily to what my musician companion recognized as Schuberts ""Unfinished Symphony""). And the creepy-crawly effects are inventive including a swarm of mechanical spiders and a freaky eye-swapping sequence. Cruise is fine as an action hero clenching his jaw and rushing about manfully. Its his fate not his fault that hes always ""Tom Cruise"" on screen -- we cant see Anderton as a regular guy because we know that face too well. (Interestingly his features are morphed into ugliness for a while midmovie -- shades of ""Vanilla Sky""?) The real knockout performance comes from Samantha Morton as the pre-cog Agatha. With very little dialogue (remember she got an Oscar nomination for playing a mute character in ""Sweet and Lowdown"") shes absolutely haunting. So pale her veins glow Agatha is burdened by knowledge shed rather not have; shes a tragic childlike figure. And dark-eyed Colin Farrell is charismatic as Andertons nemesis. ""Minority Report"" wont go down as one of Spielbergs greatest films -- there are a few gaping holes in the plot and some awkward attempts at humor. But its a wonderfully chilly thrill ride while it lasts. ""He knows. Dont go home"" says Agatha apropos of nothing to an anonymous passer-by in a mall who freezes in horror.

Starring Tom Cruise Max Von Sydow and Colin Farrell. Directed by Steven Spielberg. (VHS and DVD. PG-13. 150 minutes.) ""Minority Report"" is the least sentimental film of Steven Spielbergs career. Creative energy and intelligence inform every frame. Nothing is left to chance. This is the kind of pure entertainment that in its fullness and generosity seems almost classic. The movies virtues are not entirely Spielbergs doing but he deserves credit for knowing what he wants and recognizing it when he gets it. With the help of Philip K. Dicks original story writers Scott Frank and Jon Cohen have imagined the future world of 2054 in fantastic yet believable terms and the set design and special-effects people have realized that vision beautifully. Janusz Kaminskis cinematography subtly controls the mood while Tom Cruise gives a vigorous performance in a role full of physical and emotional demands. ""Minority Report"" takes place in an age in which murders are preventable because the cops know about them in advance. Cruise plays Anderton the chief detective in Washingtons ""precrime"" unit where -- with the help of three psychics known as ""pre-cogs"" -- his department works to stop murders before they happen. Thanks to electrodes hooked up to the pre-cogs brains Anderton and his staff see the grisly crimes before they occur and intervene. ""Minority Report"" has one of those exciting opening sequences that let the audience know its in good hands. Anderton stands in front of a holographic screen moving around frames of the pre-cogs vision searching for clues as to the location of a murder set to take place in less than an hour. A man is about to kill his wife. The cops know it before he does but gradually he comes to know it too and from there the scene becomes an exhilarating race against the clock. ""Minority Report"" is not cuddly. When Anderton comes home at the end of the day he steps out of his car into an apartment lit in a cold light. He watches video of his estranged wife and of his son who was abducted and killed years before only the video here is life-size and has the illusion of three dimensions. Just the thing to drive a grieving person crazy. Anderton is a man on the edge from the beginning. He uses illegal drugs. Hes consumed by his job and now hes worried about an inspector from the attorney generals office (Colin Farrell) who is nosing around the pre-crime unit. Things get worse when the pre-cogs predict that he will kill someone within 36 hours. Suddenly hes a wanted man in a Big Brother world in which its almost impossible to make a move without being located. Throughout everyone to whom Anderton turns for help is a little crazy which gives every scene its distinct quality. Perhaps Spielberg is borrowing a page from Robert Aldrich who did the same thing to similarly creepy effect in the noir classic ""Kiss Me Deadly."" Particularly unsettling is Lois Smith as the scientist whose research led to the establishment of the pre-crime unit. In the course of her one scene with no apparent change in her demeanor she goes from looking like a gentle older woman to seeming decadent and twisted. Throughout Spielberg makes the smart choices never getting ahead of his audience never pushing for emotions that arent earned. . This film contains violence.

This ESP-y gang whose names - Agatha Arthur Dashiell - pay playful homage to a troika of mystery fiction greats are the heart and soul of an operation that has virtually eliminated murder in the nations capital. Its deja-voodoo and its making the world a safer place to live.Or is it? (Of course not)In Minority Report Steven Spielbergs noirish sci-fi thriller set in 2054 in a cityscape that combines Jetsonian home-stylings with Blade Runner grunge and sleek institutional Matrix menace a band of preemptor police interpret the visions of the ""Pre-Cogs"" (a process involving a maestro-like flailing of hands in front of transparent screens) and arrest the would-be perpetrators before theyve done the deed.Tom Cruise wearing a brush-cut and practical black is John Anderton Pre-Crimes chief cop. Except for the fact that he has lost his young son in a swimming pool abduction which wrecked his marriage got him hooked on drugs and haunts him night and day the guy is at the top of his game.But on the eve of a referendum that would expand D.C.s Pre-Crime program nationwide trouble is a-brewing. A Justice Department investigator (Vanity Fair cover boy Colin Farrell) is asking disturbing questions (and sporting disturbing facial hair) and worse still the Pre-Cogs have issued another ""red ball"" a lotterylike tube-and-orb contraption with the name of the latest perp on it. And guess what The name is John Anderton. Suddenly Pre-Crimes premier officer is a wanted man on the run.Adapted from a Philip K. Dick short story (and working over the same futuristic mind-warping paranoia thats at the heart of Dick stories that led to Blade Runner and Total Recall) Minority Report is taut entertainment that juggles brainy ideas about perception predetermination and free will - and drops things in a messy third act where the vintage noir gets bathed in a bit too much Spielbergian glow.Still while the film deftly imagined by screenwriters Scott Frank and Jon Cohen doesnt entirely hold together its dark twisty chases and tricky puzzles have much more going for them than Spielbergs last foray onto similar turf the muddled cheesy A.I. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminskis steely color-sapped canvas has a grim beauty and the production design is top-notch (way-cool eye-scanning robotic ""spiders""). Its interesting though that Spielberg whose influence on filmmakers has been gargantuan seems to be lifting stylistic tics and tricks from other folks here the oddball funhouse frenzy of Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Delicatessen Amelie - watch the wacky quacky eye-surgeon sequence) and the dark cartoony humor of Terry Gilliam (Twelve Monkeys). And Spielberg tips his baseball cap in the direction of classic Hollywood hardboilers from Howard Hawks (The Big Sleep - paying a visit to an old-timer tending sweaty plants in a greenhouse) and John Huston (The Maltese Falcon - its not who you think it is).Minority Report also boasts a compelling turn from Samantha Morton as one of the Pre-Cogs a freaky clairvoyant quivering through different time zones and a patrician Max Von Sydow as Lamar Burgess the Washington bureaucrat whose imprint on the Department of Crime is indelible.Contact Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.Minority Report (Out of four stars)Produced by Gerald R.

"Spielberg Spins A Thrilling Sci-fi Yarn - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Steven Spielberg Spielberg Spins A Thrilling Sci-fi YarnMovies - REVIEW - Minority ReportThe Brilliant Director Returns To Peak Form And Tom Cruise Finds The Perfect Role.June 21 2002|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticWhen a brilliant filmmaker is working on intuition -- flat-out with no distractions -- the results can be exhilarating.No one questions the brilliance of Steven Spielberg whose latest film is Minority Report but for nearly a decade he has been giving himself all kinds of distractions.Saving Private Ryan (1998) Amistad (1997) and Schindlers List (1993) were burdened with the responsibilities of history. In last years A.I. Artificial Intelligence Spielberg was working off a debt to the late great Stanley Kubrick (who developed the project). And The Lost World Jurassic Park (1997) had the usual sequel obstacle of potential repetitiveness.All of these films contain superb sequences and most of them (especially Schindlers List but not A.I. and Amistad) work extremely well on their own terms. But none has the start-to-finish exploratory kick that Spielberg gave us in such classics as Jaws (1975) Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) the Indiana Jones series and his masterpiece E.T. (1982).Steven Spielberg is back in top form with Minority Report a crackerjack sci-fi thriller with an edgy Hitchcockian vibe.Though the movie is based on a story by Philip K. Dick (whose work also inspired Blade Runner and Total Recall) Spielberg isnt limited by notions of faithfulness to the source. Dick describes the hero of his story as ""old and worn-out"" -- a pipe-puffing administrator with his mind on retirement.But John Anderton the action-oriented hero of the film is played by the still-in-his-prime Tom Cruise. Instead of smoking a pipe he indulges in illicit futuristic drugs to dull the pain of the loss of his child.The year is 2054 and Anderton is the top cop in the elite ""pre-crime"" unit in Washington D.C. Working on tips from a trio of ""pre-cog"" psychics the pre-crime cops stop murders before they take place.Of course there are certain civil liberty concerns about arresting people before they commit crimes. And these concerns reach crisis proportions when Anderton himself is accused of the future murder of a man he has never met.For most of Minority Report (which opens today) Anderton is on the run from his own department. If he cant find a way to establish his innocence -- and by the way the fallibility of pre-crime procedures -- hes done for.Because Minority Report is a thriller there is little chance of Spielbergs drifting off into the sci-fi ozone as he did in A.I. This time he has a straightforward yarn to spin and the spinning keeps him on course.At the same time Spielbergs visual imagination has never been more splendid.Although Minority Report is filmed in color the colors are so simplified and muted that they resemble a heightened eerie form of black-and-white. And in the suggestive atmosphere established by the director and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (Saving Private Ryan) the movies pervasive water imagery is haunting.So many scenes are visually impressive that you can lose track of the highlights.When Anderton stands before a giant screen on which pre-cog visions appear and twists his arms to focus and refocus the images he might be the conductor of some enchanted orchestra or a filmmaker in an experimental editing room.The chases turn into kinetic daredevil encounters such as the one in which Anderton fends off a small army of flying cops by using their own high-tech might against them. Theres also the scene in which he races through D.C. in a futuristic car that can travel at high speed in virtually any direction even vertically on wall-like roads.Anderton is an ideal role for Cruise. Hes not the sort of bookish intellectual guy that Cruise for some reason often likes to play (and which is clearly outside his range). Anderton is shrewd and observant but hes essentially a man of action.Cruise has always moved gracefully on film and he has never looked better than he does in most of this movie.For some reason however the star has recently taken to playing men whose faces become grotesquely distorted at least temporarily. And he is at it again. Perhaps he feels uncomfortable about how far his looks have taken him. In any case the facial-distortion scenes dont seem calculated to punish his fans as they did in Vanilla Sky.There is however a wonderfully creepy sequence in which Anderton to confuse the governments retina-scanning devices has his eyeballs replaced by others. During the surgery his eyes are held open with clips that look borrowed from the brainwashing scenes in Kubricks A Clockwork Orange.Later in an effectively grisly-funny gag Andertons original eyeballs slip away and roll down the street with our hero chasing after them.Speaking of creepy Peter Stormare (Fargo) is marvelously unsettling as the twisted physician who performs the eye surgery.

Five years passed between Schindlers List and Saving Private Ryan his two such films that worked. With his other movies more often than not when he tries to get serious his temperament and childlike sensibility trip him up. Minority Report is down-and-dirty Spielberg. He shows a brutal murder in the opening moments and then he shows it again. And again. The images visions of a crime not yet committed flash upon transparent screens in an icy see-through room. Crime fighters study them for clues. This is another stroll down a dark path into a scientifically advanced future like last years AI Artificial Intelligence. This time however the ghost of Stanley Kubrick isnt leading. With this often-stunning totally engrossing and daring movie the director is going solo to a place hes never been. He doesnt quite get there. Spielberg studied noir classics such as The Maltese Falcon as well as Alfred Hitchcocks innocent-man-on-the-run tales to prepare for this film which raises intriguing questions about society the way good science fiction should. But he betrays the spirit of film noir and nudges the societal issues aside in favor of turning this into another of his lost-boy epics. Tom Cruise is John Anderton the crackerjack chief of the Justice Departments Pre-Crime unit circa 2054 which arrests people for future crimes. At night however Anderton wallows in memories of a tragic loss and haunts dark alleys for drugs. He is a classic noir anti-hero a flawed haunted man in need of redemption but Cruise plays him as an Eagle Scout with issues. Were told Anderton joined Pre-Crime which has put an end to murder in the nations capital because of the disappearance and presumed murder of his son. Anderton doesnt question the ramifications of what he does so intent is he on stopping crime. He never considers the possibility the system could make a mistake. He is an idealist when the film needs an avenger or at least something other than a perfect professional. Much has been written about Cruises courage in taking the role but he wouldve shown real courage if hed revealed to us his characters scars. Things change for Anderton when the Pre-Cogs entities who receive the premonitions and whom he thinks are infallible see a vision of him committing murder. He is pursued not only by the team he trained but also by a Justice Department investigator with dubious motives (Colin Farrell). Anderton must rely on one of the Pre-Cogs (Samantha Morton) for help. Minority Report is adapted from a 1956 short story by the late Philip K. Dick whose stories about technologys effect on what it means to be human have had a huge influence on movies and subsequent science fiction. Blade Runner Ridley Scotts 1982 film that set the standard for this sort of thing was adapted from a Dick story. Spielberg and his team took extraordinary care to achieve a distinctive look but comparisons are unavoidable. Spielberg is the superior filmmaker in large part because he has heart. His movies reach us emotionally in a way Scotts seldom do. But a surfeit of heart and a lack of commitment to the ideas at the core of the material has resulted in a dazzling example of failed opportunities and misplaced emphasis. In many ways this is an amazing movie. Among the most impressive qualities are the cinematography and production design. Most shots are bled of warmth and color and Janusz Kaminski Spielbergs longtime cinematographer achieves a grainy high-contrast look that accentuates the gritty sense of reality Spielberg reaches for. This is a novel idea -- a big budget sci-fi movie one in which people fly Flash Gordon-style with packs strapped to their backs and cars glide vertically up the side of buildings thats nonetheless grounded in the real. The novelty doesnt always pay off however. The first big chase scene is fascinating to watch but oddly unexciting. The film does a good job of developing some lesser themes. Andertons son disappeared at a public swimming pool when Anderton looked away. Eye imagery and the importance of vision thread throughout the story though the movie runs it into the ground. Also prevalent is the idea of lost children. The Pre-Cogs are grown-up children gifted infants taken from drug-addicted mothers and experimented upon. Most of them die as a result. The three who survive are kept locked in a womblike room floating in fluid hooked to machines with electronic umbilical cords forced to endure awful visions of death. Anderton too is a lost child of sorts. Max Von Sydow plays his father figure one of the creators of Pre-Crime who isnt there for him in time of need. This is Spielbergs great recurring subject but this time it gets in the way of the central issues which include the loss of privacy and the dangers of the police state. It belongs in the background. The movie is full of visual quotes and inside jokes. Some shots will call to mind Kubricks sci-fi classics 2001 A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange. Others reference Hitchcock. Watch closely and you might catch glimpses of Cameron Crowe and Cameron Diaz who worked on Vanilla Sky Cruises last movie in the background. Nods to these films all make sense but some shots call attention to themselves for no good reason Anderton and his Pre-Cog helper struggle down a grimy hallway at one point light from a window casting shadows on their faces. Weve seen similar images in 1940s detective movies but this shot is so striking it pulls us out of the story. Another fleeting image pointlessly calls to mind Ingmar Bergmans Persona. And a scene on a factory conveyor belt admittedly a movie cliche is so similar to a scene in Attack of the Clones it must be deliberate. But to what end? The film eschews the slick computerized artificiality of most recent sci-fi movies but it opts for eye candy of a different sort. This impulse to offer constant gratification both visually and narratively to keep the audience engaged and unchallenged is prototypical Spielberg. The film reaches toward greatness but fails because it is too perfect a projection of its creator. Nevertheless we should celebrate it because this makes it -- flaws and all -- more valuable than 1000 soulless committee-hatched flicks.

Indeed the movie has more in common with Schindlers List than might appear -- as were graduating from college and passing on Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone making Minority Report is part of Spielbergs belated growing-up project. The movie is based on a characteristically bleak short story by Philip K. Dick which predicates a social order that has all but abolished privacy civil rights the separation of powers and for that matter the integrity of the individual. The protagonist John Anderton is an aging commissioner of ""Pre-Crime"" who falls victim to his own brainchild -- an apparently watertight system of prevention based on the detection by three mutant ""pre-cogs"" who can predict the future of crimes before they are committed. The ""offenders"" are shipped off to detention camps without trial before the deed is done which is why America hasnt seen a murder in six years -- until one day Anderton already paranoid about the arrival of an ambitious younger colleague named Witwer who wants his job discovers that he himself has been fingered for the future murder of a man hes never met and is forced to flee from the very subordinates he helped train. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - For an author whos had several visually arresting films adapted from his work -- he died at 53 of a heart attack in 1982 just as Ridley Scott was putting the finishing touches to the first Blade Runner -- Dick is almost perversely un-cinematic. He showed scant interest in the techno-toys and superhuman life forms that quicken the blood of most sci-fi fans today. By his own admission science fiction was his chosen genre only because he found it convenient for the expression of big ideas. Dick was a sociologist and a philosopher of the near future and reading ""The Minority Report"" which was published in 1956 one gets the sense that he had the turn of the millennium pretty much nailed right down to a startlingly prescient reference to ""self-seekers"" trying to get rich by a quick raid on the stock market. Dicks story is almost all dialogue with only the barest description of the pre-cogs or the lab that houses them or the heli-ships that carry the police from place to place. The United States it tersely sketches is a featureless landscape filled with rubbish and defaced by a crippling war with the Chinese. The storys chilly paranoia has been skillfully tailored for the screen in Scott Franks elegant rewrite of Jon Cohens original adaptation. For Spielberg Minority Report has been set in Washington D.C. in the year 2054 where by day John Anderton played with his usual serviceable professionalism by Tom Cruise is a high-functioning wheel in the Pre-Crime apparatus. He scans and sorts images from the fried brains of the three pre-cogs (one of whom bears a striking resemblance to the young British actress Samantha Morton) as they languish in their baby-blue liquid suspension chamber dreaming of the murders that Anderton along with a posse of lantern-jawed deputies will pre-empt sending the suspects into perpetual limbo in form-fitting prisons of their own. But both Andertons boss Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow) and Witwer (Harts Wars Colin Farrell) a young upstart from the District Attorneys Office suspect that theres a flaw in their colleagues total commitment to Pre-Crime. Andertons marriage and his life were destroyed years before when his little boy was kidnapped from a public swimming pool. By night Anderton is a wreck jogging through the citys decrepit ghetto the Sprawl looking to score the drugs that keep him afloat or sitting in his apartment or watching old home holograms of his wife and son. ""Gotta keep running"" he mutters under his breath and when the red ball that identifies future murderers pops out with his name on it Anderton is soon on the run through a high-tech fun house of futuristic machinery and grotesque life forms just waiting to engulf him as he tries to find out why or whether two out of three pre-cogs may have turned out a faulty majority report. SPIELBERG HAS STYLED MINORITY REPORT AFTER 40s film noir yet in rummaging through his toy box for whats new hes constantly lifting the movie from its broody alienation toward an impish visual wit that serves its larger themes. Never has product placement been such fun -- theres some genuinely funny business with a Lexus that was specially designed for the film (a well-guarded model sits outside on the Fox lot near the screening room) and Anderton has only to step inside the Gap in a streamlined super-mall and -- thanks to eye-print identification -- a God-like voice announces who he is and exactly where his taste in clothing lies. Theres a marvelous set piece in which Anderton seeks out retired Pre-Crime researcher Iris Hineman (played with ghoulish relish by Lois Smith) for information on the pre-cogs She greets him in a greenhouse full of whispering writhing mutant plants. But its the bodys most vulnerable external organs -- the eyes -- that provide the movies most trenchant comic horror not least when the residents of a tenement in which Anderton is holed up must interrupt their domestic activities to submit their eyes to examination by a swarm of computerized surveillance spiders. With Minority Report Spielberg means to enjoy himself while doing justice to Dicks paranoid vision of big government overstepping itself. But being the bright-eyed boy he is Spielberg can never travel all the way with Dick an incorrigible pessimist who gave his readers no quarter. Dick pursued the black heart of the corporate state to its unlovely conclusion -- in the short story when things go awry its through an unintended consequence of the system and were forced to consider the most un-American proposition that the individual may have to sacrifice himself for the system to survive. The old-fashioned humanist in Spielberg will go along with this just so far before he starts restoring both the individual and the system to their better selves. Minority Report is finally a celebration of the pursuit of life liberty and happiness. About the fate of the first two Dick had his own morbid ideas He saw little in life to celebrate and few possibilities for liberty. As to the third for the often-divorced frequently ill periodically doped and perennially anxious Dick happiness was always a foreign country -- which is why his story ends with a dry cynical chuckle. Spielberg must redeem his heroes -- which is why his movie ends with family ties. Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke? NEXT Contact Ella Taylor Follow L.A.

Rick Groen Liam Lacey Ray Conlogue Kevin Courrier Jennie Punter From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 16 2002 1200AM EDT Last updated Saturday Mar. 21 2009 1259AM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The following rated on a system of 0 to 4 stars are by Rick Groen Liam Lacey Ray Conlogue Kevin Courrier and Jennie Punter. Full reviews appeared on the dates indicated. Austin Powers in Goldmember Really pretty funny. After three movies and six years of Mike Myerss shagadelic flouncy-shirted buck-toothed homunculus and of his ever-expanding cartoon world its become easier to surrender than resist. Place it against any of a host of barren summer comedies and the difference is obvious Myerss sheer fertility of invention is of a higher order and even if he misses as often as he hits hes definitely a swinger. PG (July 26) -- L.L. Blood Work It once was a pleasure to watch a Clint Eastwood-directed movie. Now its all duty. He stars here too as an aging FBI agent with a new heart but the same old attitude. The picture has flashes of merit early on yet soon gets tired and careless -- an apparent case of chronic fatigue syndrome. Blood Work needs a transfusion and so does Clint. AA (Aug. 9) -- R.G. Full Frontal1/2 Director Steven Soderbergh who has made it very big in studio-land chooses here to work small again -- to shoot a little film at a hectic pace on a modest budget. In truth the result is more a regression than a retreat a rather self-indulgent exercise in Godardian deconstruction stripping away those layers of cinematic artifice. His ontologicial puzzle has its moments of interest but ultimately the whole game seems long on effort and short on reward. AA (Aug. 2) -- R.G. Happy Times In this bittersweet comedy from Chinese director Zhang Yimou ( Raise the Red Lantern) a retired fast-talking factory worker secures a bride through seemingly harmless self-aggrandizing lies (the hotel he manages is actually an abandoned bus). Complications arise when he takes pity on her blind teenage stepdaughter whom he employs at his ""hotel"" and the two form a brief but ultimately life-altering bond. PG (Aug. 9) -- J.P. K-19 The Widowmaker Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson assume Russian-tinted accents in re-enacting the real-life story of the Russian nuclear-powered ballistic sub that nearly turned the North Atlantic into a nuclear soup in 1961. Most of the movie is a formulaic exercise in chest-beating between Harrison as the tyrannical captain and Neeson as his troubled executive officer but both the movie and the sub heat up dramatically when the reactor begins to leak and the ordinary sailors try desperately to patch a radioactive leak that leaves them violently ill almost instantly. Its the one point where director Kathryn Bigelow brings something to the movie before it concludes in a generic tribute to military patriotism. PG (July 19) -- L.L. Lovely and Amazing A film about the lives and minds of two self-obsessed New York women (Catherine Keener and Emily Mortimer) may scare off some as the worst sort of womans movie -- but the pleasant shock here is that Lovely and Amazing is about a group of women so well observed and so freshly written that questions of genre dont matter at all. This is a fine funny humane film. AA (July 19) -- R.C. The Master of Disguise Not so cleverly disguised as a feature movie this is really just an 80-minute excuse for Dana Carvey to do countless impressions of people and animals and things. Carvey is fine the script is non-existent -- as are the laughs. PG (Aug. 2) -- R.G. Men in Black II1/2 A short flashy and slight comic sequel to the 1997 blockbuster with Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones reprising their roles as federal agents who don dark suits and Ray-Bans to track down illegal extraterrestrials. This time theyre fighting a nasty creature dressed up as a Victorias Secret model (played by Lara Flynn Boyle). After the initial setup when Agent Jay (Smith) must once again recruit Agent Kay (Jones) the movie devolves into a tour of rubbery alien encounters. PG (July 3) -- L.L. Minority Report1/2 At the very least you expect a Steven Spielberg film to show signs of his oversized imprimatur to contain within it a few sequences only available to a director of his kinetic gifts. But not here. Minority Report is a major disappointment not because its a minor movie. Coming from anyone else it would be an acceptably average summer flick a lightweight dabbling in futuristic film noir. Coming from Spielberg however the merely average starts to seem woefully bland just everyday film beige. AA (June 21) -- R.G. The Road to Perdition Pulpy solemn and meticulous director Sam Mendess follow-up to the Oscar-winning American Beauty is based on a graphic novel and a Japanese comic and is designed to bring attention to every curl of smoke and weather-beaten shingle. This studied dark examination of betrayal and vengeance features Tom Hanks as a dignified hitman in rural Illinois in 1929 with Paul Newman as the avuncular gang-boss who is his spiritual father and subsequent enemy. The story follows Hankss character as he goes on a bank-robbing spree with his young son in an effort to force the gangsters to give up one of their own. Emotionally reserved and flat-footed in its ending The Road to Perdition is nevertheless a worthwhile journey. AA (July 12) -- L.L. Scooby-Doo1/2 Part homage part parody and mostly a mess Scooby-Doo is 100-million dollars worth of computer-generated monsters fart jokes and visual and narrative chaos in the service of adapting a 30-year-old cartoon about teenaged ghost-busters and a talking Great Dane. Freddie Prinze Jr. (as Fred) and Sarah Michelle Gellar (as Daphne) star though Matthew Lillard (as Shaggy) is the only cast member who emerges from the wreckage with his reputation enhanced. F (June 14) -- L.L. Signs1/2 Lots of atmosphere and some spooky moments dont entirely compensate for a thin story in the latest philosophical thriller from M. Night Shyamalan ( The Sixth Sense). Mel Gibson stars as a Pennsylvania farmer and former pastor who lost his faith when his wife died. An attack by aliens -- who seem determined to win the Earth home-by-home -- teaches him whats what. Joaquim Phoenix and Rory Culkin also star. PG (Aug. 2) -- L.L. Spy Kids 2 The Island of Lost Dreams1/2 In this blissfully entertaining sequel to Spy Kids (2001) Robert Rodriguez effortlessly employs a vast arsenal of digital and visual effects with such assurance and imaginative aplomb that youre enthralled even as youre gasping with laughter. While trying to establish their reputation in the espionage network Carmen (Alexa Vega) and Juni (Daryl Sabara) find themselves at odds with two rogue spy kids. When a cloaking device is stolen and taken to a mysterious island Carmen and Juni try to retrieve it before their counterparts do. PG (Aug. 7) -- K.C. Stuart Little 2 Stuart Little 2 takes to the skies in a sequel to the 1999 movie loosely based on E. B. Whites 1945 classic childrens book about a gentlemanly mouse in Manhattan. This time out the filmmakers wisely take a page or two from Whites taleincluding the introduction of Stuarts sweet bird friend Margalo. The wise-cracking cat Snowball again appears and again steals the show. Vacillating between sappy and snappy this is featherweight family fare. F (July 19) -- J.P. Sunshine State1/2 A loving look at a beleaguered island community Sunshine State has the structure the theme the style and at 141 minutes the length of a great John Sayles film. What it doesnt have alas is the merit. Coming from any other director this would be a relatively worthy effort. But from one of the founding fathers of the American independent movement its a mild disappointment. PG (Aug. 9) -- R.G. Thirteen Conversations About One Thing A quietly dramatic interweaving of tales about four New Yorkers whose placid lives are knocked off course by random events. The prosecutor turned hit-and-run driver and the housemaid who despairs when a good deed goes awry are interesting in themselves but its Alan Arkin as a cynical insurance-company manager who steals the film. When he thinks violent thoughts a red pen in his shirt pocket tends to leak. This kind of near-European symbolism makes Jill Sprechers film a refreshingly different New York story. PG (July 5) -- L.L. XXX1/2 Theres nothing more predictable than a rebel with a cause. XXX wants to be a high-octane ultramodern pic boasting (in hunk du jour Vin Diesel) a brand new breed of antihero -- shaven of head tattooed of body snarl on lip and trigger finger itching for video-game carnage. But scratch the surface (a fingernail will do) and what lies beneath is just another arch-conformist lurking in our token rebel.

USATODAY.com - The verdict is in Minority rules Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 06/23/2002 - Updated 1153 PM ET The verdict is in Minority rules By Mike Clark USA TODAY Minority Report (out of four) Stars Tom Cruise Colin Farrell Samantha Morton Max von Sydow Kathryn Morris Director Steven Spielberg Distributor 20th Century Fox Rating PG-13 for violence brief language some sexuality and drug content. When Hollywoods first teaming of Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg delivers the goods and then some it almost seems unfair to have fate intervene on its behalf as well. Minority Report set in 2054 benefits from chance timing Its as topical as movies get. Like Blade Runner the futuristic sci-fi mystery is based on a Philip K. Dick story and smoothly blends the emotional and coolly technological. It deals with the prediction of criminal acts and the arrest of pre-felons often seconds before the crime is committed. During a six-year tryout in Washington D.C. the system however frenzied has never failed and everyone seems pleased. Those people include civil libertarians (now a rare species) and even the Department of Pre-Crimes perpetually unhappy unit chief (Cruise) whos still distraught over the unsolved abduction of his son six years earlier.

Video Cruise Spielberg discuss Minority Report Cruise is less complacent when this complex systems psychic Pre-Cogs -- emotionally fragile humans whove been infallible prognosticators of crime -- peg him as a murderer in a hotel incident that is only 36 hours away. Cruise is flummoxed after hearing the victims name because he doesnt know it which raises two possibilities This perfect system is flawed after all or hes been set up. His co-workers have neither the time nor the training to deal with such subtleties and are immediately on him as he flees. Scott Frank and Jon Cohen contribute to a breathless 140-minute pace with a no-flab script packed with all kinds of surprises. Humor constantly materializes in the strangest contexts including some of the funniest product placement scenes ever. Unforgettable eccentrics pop up everywhere the dizzily sinister horticulturist who invented the system (veteran Lois Smith sublime); the filthy underground surgeon who gives Cruise a new pair of eyes (Fargos Peter Stormare); and a Pre-Cog who ends up being the most emotionally resonant character (Samantha Morton possibly looking at her second Oscar nomination after Sweet and Lowdown). Also invaluable are production design that suggests what the nations capital might look like in 50 years and the knowing portrayal of hardball government smoothies (Colin Farrell Max von Sydow). Stripped of all bravado Cruise delivers a raw and probably detractor-proof performance. Spielberg does what he did right in creating a novel milieu for A.I. Artificial Intelligence but this time the writing is fresher and anything but unwieldy. Its hard to imagine wanting anything more -- even from a Cruise-Spielberg matchup.

Running time 144 minutes. Rated PG-13 (violence profanity sexuality drug use). At the Empire the Beekman the Union Square others. HOW much freedom would it be worth giving up to live in a crime-free world? Thats the provocative and extremely timely question explored in ""Minority Report"" Steven Spielbergs dark ambitious and memorable new thriller. Tom Cruise never better plays John Anderton the hugely troubled head of an elite mid-21st-century police squad that for the past six years has eliminated all murder in the District of Columbia. The squad employs a trio of mysterious psychics suspended in what looks like a gigantic hot tub to foresee murders - so the would-killers can be apprehended by cops before the fact. The highly promoted program is set to go national but ambitious FBI observer Danny Witwer (the excellent Colin Farrell) has been sent in by the attorney general to look for ""human flaws"" in the system. When the psychics suddenly predict that John himself will murder a stranger in less than 36 hours he suspects hes being set up by Danny - and flees certain arrest. ""Minority Report"" contains some of Spielbergs most exciting action sequences since ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" especially a really cool chase on top of magnetic cars descending the sides of tall buildings and into a robotics car factory. Like 1980s ""Blade Runner"" - which was also adapted from a story by sci-fi visionary Philip K. Dick - ""Minority Report"" is partly an homage to film noir and detective fiction. When he isnt tracking perps by manipulating the psychics images like a conductor John spends his free time inhaling drugs and watching 3-D images of his young son who disappeared after being snatched at a public pool years earlier. John descends into the scuzzy D.C. neighborhood where he scores drugs to seek help from the shady Dr. Eddie (a wonderfully sleazy Peter Stormare). Dr. Eddie gives John new eyeballs to elude the retinal-scanning technology that allows the authorities -and merchants like The Gap - to keep track of everyones comings and goings in 2054. Indeed in one of the creepiest sequences Johns former squad unleashes mechanical spiders into a ghetto dwelling to check everyones eyes. By this point John is deep into the mysteries of the ""pre-cog"" program. He seeks out clues from his smooth but shadowy boss Lamar (Max von Sydow) the eccentric woman (Lois Smith in a nice greenhouse homage to ""The Big Sleep"") who helped devise the system - and the ghoulish organ-playing jailer of the pre-accused murderers (Tim Blake Nelson). It would be a crime to give away the twists in Scott Frank and Jon Cohens clever screenplay. But its safe to report they come to involve the lead psychic (an awesome Samantha Morton) and Johns ex-wife (Kathryn Morris) and raise deep philosophical issues - like pre-determination and suspects rights - not often encountered in a summer blockbuster. Less poetic than Spielbergs severely underrated ""A.I."" his new film labors to make its complex plot accessible to audiences with lots of explanatory dialogue - and an ending that seems a bit schmaltzy and pat given whats come before. But thats a small price to pay for one of Hollywoods most breathtaking glimpses of the near future - a heart-pounding experience that makes you think and contains a gallery of characters that will haunt your nightmares for years to come.

Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Steven Spielberg Tom Cruise Entertainment News Little Stevie Spielberg is all grown up now -- and the results are startling. ""Minority Report"" adapted from a Philip K. Dick short story continues Spielbergs journey into interior darkness. Both literally and thematically it follows on the heels of last years ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" in which the little boy -- always at the center of Spielbergs universe -- is a robot Peter Pan a baby emotion-vampire who can never grow up. In ""Minority Report"" the little boy exists only in photographs; he has been abducted by a stranger and presumably molested and killed leaving behind a tortured dad addicted to mood-altering drugs and happy-family holographic images. This childless father a Washington police detective named John Anderton (Tom Cruise) becomes a savior of sorts to a motherless child (Samantha Morton) who has been raised as a kind of psychic circus freak her entire life a series of horrible screaming nightmares. ""A.I."" was a challenging intriguing mess a film that perhaps labored too hard to emulate Spielbergs idol Stanley Kubrick. (Its reputation and its significance as a landmark in Spielbergs career will grow with posterity.) With ""Minority Report"" Spielberg has completed the transformation. And if he will never be Kubrick he has become fully Kubrickian -- a master genre stylist with a surprisingly cold heart. If you really want to be cynical you might call this the best Paul Verhoeven film since ""Starship Troopers."" ""Minority Report"" blends the conventions of 1930s film noir with classic modernist science fiction and the more recent dystopian tradition of ""Blade Runner"" and ""The Matrix."" If theres nothing especially original about the combination its brilliantly executed as pure cinema both breathtaking and disturbing. Pure cinema however is all it is. Steven Spielberg has grown up into of all things a superior film artist. He is no longer a social commentator an observer of contemporary life or a historian if in fact he ever was any of those things. In the world of movies hes a grown-up and maybe nowhere else. You could argue -- and probably should -- that this limitation will keep him from greatness. Something has been lost and something gained; how you judge the transaction is up to you. Gone is the so-called childlike wonder of ""E.T."" or ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" which in any case always masked a fear of the dark a terror at what might lie under the bed. (I have often facetiously argued that the terrifying ""Poltergeist"" which Spielberg oversaw but did not officially direct was his most honest film about American childhood.) Gone mercifully is the earnest drudgery of ""Amistad"" or ""The Color Purple."" No ones going to miss that latter quality but some critics and viewers are likely to feel that the warm and fuzzy Spielberg is somehow more genuine than the contemporary icy-genius version and that some fulsome ideal of popular cinema has been sacrificed to phony notions of art blah blah blah. I say screw it Bring on the grimness. No filmmaker has ever needed to get in touch with his inner perversity so badly. Love it or hate it ""Minority Report"" brings a cruel and even demonic current that has long flowed under Spielbergs work to the surface as a rushing geyser. I can hardly wait for the fourth Indiana Jones movie which Spielberg will reportedly direct for 2005 release. Will Indy grown too decrepit and cowardly for adventuring limp through the back alleys of Cairo from brothel to opium den? ""Minority Report"" is set about halfway through the 21st century when the Washington police have established an experimental ""precrime"" unit that relies on the observations of three psychics or ""precogs"" who are kept sealed off from the world in a swimming-pool unit called the Temple. When the precogs detect that someone in D.C. is about to commit a murder Anderton uses a kind of heads-up transparent display unit to compose their visions into a coherent picture of victim perpetrator and setting. His elite team then hits the streets arriving in a comfortable Georgetown home for example just seconds before a wronged husband is about to plunge the scissors into his adulterous wifes heart. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski Spielbergs sidekick since ""Schindlers List"" in 1993 renders this middle-distance future in watery muted hues of blue and gray simultaneously suggesting the precogs Jacuzzi visions of homicide and the black-and-white crime films of the 30s Spielberg has long worshipped. A meddling federal agent named Witwer (Colin Farrell) who at first seems like Andertons principal adversary looks precisely like the federal agent who might be pursuing John Garfield or Edward G. Robinson Hes got the pinstriped double-breasted suit in fine broadcloth the slicked-back hair the pencil-thin mustache. The screenplay to this long-brewing project (credited after a Writers Guild arbitration process to Scott Frank and Jon Cohen) muddles through some murky passages about how and why the precogs were created and the metaphysical significance of what they do. But theyre not all that central to the future Spielberg presents here which seems alternately familiar -- holographic ads that greet you by name cereal boxes crawling with maddening animation psychoactive designer drugs -- and like the product of nostalgia for 20th-century futurism with its vertical cities of glass and concrete its jet-packs its electromagnetic cars. You Might Also Like What feels right about the precogs is not the mystical hoo-ha surrounding their visions of murders-to-come but the fact that they make possible a kind of Ashcroftian security state in which individuals are literally imprisoned within their own heads without trial for crimes they havent (yet) committed. And the precogs themselves as the briskly efficient Anderton gradually comes to realize are nothing more than mutant slaves held in thrall by a techno-Calvinist conception of fate and predestination. When the precogs suddenly present a vision of Anderton himself killing a man hes never heard of he has to ask himself that central noir-hero question Who am I and what am I capable of? Cruise is generally regarded as an affable action hero without depth an almost robotic exemplar of American maleness. Anderton isnt a protagonist whos likely to engage your passions but Spielberg has done an admirable job of pulling some deeply damaged weirdness from beneath Cruises bland persona. Andertons a good cop when hes at work but he sits around his sterile hive-like apartment at night inhaling an illegal street stimulant and talking to holograms of his missing son (abducted from a public swimming pool) and the mousy wife (Kathryn Morris) who has drifted off to a Cape Cod-esque retreat rendered in even more washed-out colors than the rest of the film. When hes on the run Anderton seems to wander through a pastiche version of film history from the city of Fritz Langs ""Metropolis"" through the baroque urban intrigue of ""The Big Sleep"" and ""Chinatown"" and the Gothic sci-fi of ""Blade Runner."" He ventures into the lair of the geneticist who accidentally created the precogs and this reclusive genius -- who is raising carnivorous flowers in a greenhouse naturally -- turns out to be a woman with a vaguely predatory manner. Its a nice conflation of various noir cliches (and a terrific cameo for Lois Smith). In an enjoyable but arguably irrelevant bit of grotesquerie Anderton undergoes black-market eye surgery (to evade the omnipresent retinal scans) and like any good noir hero ends up blindfolded and trapped in a filthy apartment. Also as the hero of the film Anderton does not realize until long after we do that Burgess (Max von Sydow) his fatherly superior -- following in the footsteps of hundreds of duplicitous Hollywood judges and police commissioners before him -- is perhaps not worthy of his undying trust. (""That which keeps us safe"" von Sydow intones in an infomercial for the precrime program ""will also keep us free."") So yes much of ""Minority Report"" plays like a game but its a game whose board and pieces have that slimy slippery feeling that comes from the underside of the id. When Anderton begins to communicate with Agatha (Morton) the primary precog whose visions dont quite conceal a deadly secret the film gets a bone-sizzling jolt of electricity. To save himself from committing a foreordained murder he has to pull Agatha out of her womblike tank into a world that can only terrify and disorient her. (He also has to buy her clothes at the Gap in one of the movies more cynically amusing product-placement sequences.) The connection between Anderton and Agatha two people who have lost everything important and have only each other is intensely physical but not exactly sexual; its needy and strange and sadomasochistic but still innocent. Theres a distinction between the swaddling comfort of sentimentality -- in which Spielberg has long specialized -- and the uncontrollable not-quite-conscious buzz of deeply felt emotion and this is one of the latters rare appearances in his work. Agathas visions are both fallible and reliable Anderton indeed finds himself facing a man hes never met before in the predetermined hotel room and various elements of the movies mystery -- the fate of Andertons son the role of Burgess the identity of the murdered woman in an allegedly prevented crime that Agatha keeps compulsively replaying -- come into clearer focus. As in all noir films (and this may or may not be a flaw) not all these questions will be answered in the end and the nature of fate and free will remains as puzzling as ever. Its too early to know whether ""Minority Report"" on the heels of ""A.I."" marks a brief detour in Spielbergs career or a permanent change of course but either way its a dark and dazzling spectacle. Even his attempt to craft a resolution to Anderton and Agathas stories feels more like an offer of shelter and succor than a happy ending. Adults can survive and adjust even build anew amid the emotional wreckage of their pasts. But the terrors in the darkness -- the boogeymen who tear children from their parents the nightmares whose details you cant quite make out -- never go away. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

"A Walk in the Dark - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEWS A Walk in the DarkSteven Spielberg gets all creepy in Minority Report but Tom Cruise keeps things humanJune 21 2002|KENNETH TURAN | TIMES STAFF WRITER It took paranoid visionary Philip K. Dick to do what Stanley Kubrick could not Get Steven Spielberg to fully cross over to the dark side. The question now is how happy are we to have him there?Spielbergs ""Minority Report"" is amplified from a Dick short story by writers Scott Frank and Jon Cohen and it stars Tom Cruise as a man hunted by the futuristic anti-crime unit he once led. It finds Hollywoods preeminent director more convincingly at home with unapologetically bleak and unsettling material than he was with Kubricks ""A.I."" ""I wanted to make the ugliest dirtiest movie I have ever made"" Spielberg told cinematographer Janusz Kaminski and theres little doubt hes succeeded.In a macro sense this is a good thing. ""Minority Report"" is full of the pleasure this most proficient director feels in stretching himself in redeploying his formidable skills and avoiding as many directors have not simply making the same film over and over.But the road to self-knowledge can be an uneven one and as impressive as this disturbing even haunting film can be it does not feel all of a piece. If anything ""Minority Report"" is trying to do too much trying to combine elements--philosophical futuristic hard-boiled criminal--that havent been made to completely cohere. This is a film that gives us a lot to chew on but not all of it has been properly digested.What is best and creepiest about ""Minority Report"" comes from Dick brilliant at envisioning a future thats got us by the throat. Dick is essential here even though (a) his original was not a novel but a 31-page short story published in 1956 in a magazine called Fantastic Universe and (b) what was retained is little more than a core plot line (a system hunting one of its own) and single speculative premise. But what a premise that was.Dick whose fiction has been most prominently turned into ""Total Recall"" and the landmark ""Blade Runner"" came up with the notion of a system that harnessed the minds of a trio of psychics who visualized murders before they happened to a police force that arrested perpetrators before any crime was committed. With his gift for wordplay (""replicant"" the key ""Blade Runner"" word was his) Dick called the psychics ""precogs"" (from ""precognition"") and the system itself Precrime.As greatly fleshed out by Frank and Cohen the two-hour 17-minute ""Minority Report"" starts out with what is in effect a prologue that shows how the Precrime system run by Chief John Anderton (Cruise) with a zeal that turns out to have distinctly personal underpinnings actually works in Washington D.C. in the year 2054.When the precogs have their visions (filmed by effects house Imaginary Forces which did the memorable opening titles for ""Seven"") they are transferred to computerized images that the chief physically orchestrates to look for clues as to geographic location so he knows where to send his men. With crimes of passion such as the one that opens the film the race to get to the scene before the deed is done can be nerve-racking.Precrime has turned Washington the only city that uses it into Americas safest There hasnt been a murder in the nations capital in six years. But now on the eve of the systems greatest triumph a referendum on whether Precrime should go national there are worries that the government wants to take it away from Anderton and Precrimes founder Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow). In fact slimy Justice Department operative Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) seems to have just such a scenario in mind.In Dicks story the precogs ""gibbering fumbling creatures with their enlarged heads and wasted bodies"" were considerably stranger than they are on film where the comatose Art Dash and Agatha lie suspended in a liquid solution in a secure room called the Temple. ""Its better"" someone says ""if you dont think of them as human.""Its Agatha a precog acting in a distinctly human way that puts ""Minority Reports"" plot into gear by grabbing Anderton urgently whispering ""Can you see?"" and directing his attention to a precog vision of a considerably older crime. Intrigued despite a warning that ""you dig up the past all you get is dirty"" Anderton starts to investigate. Which is also when Precrime suddenly fingers him as a murderer claiming--and the system has never been wrong--that he will kill a man hes never met or even heard of in exactly 36 hours.Anderton on the run staying ahead of his pursuers while trying to figure out if the method hes devoted himself to could be flawed takes up the bulk of ""Minority Report."" Like several of the films aspects the thriller plot is involving but only up to a point.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESEd Asners minority reportJuly 10 2008A Policy Scarier Than the MovieJune 20 2002Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jun/21/entertainment/et-kenny21,200,minorityreport29,minorityreport,latimes

Nobody wears bright colors and its very very crowded. ""Minority Report"" set in Washington D.C. in the year 2054 will set Thomas Jefferson spinning in his grave. The ACLU wont be happy either and anyone who has a soft spot for the Bill of Rights will just have to get over it. Based on a 1956 short story by Philip K. Dick -- which Tom Cruise read and passed on to Steven Spielberg -- ""Minority Report"" is a dark futuristic film noir with thrills chills and production values that bring to mind such classics as ""Blade Runner"" (a 1982 movie also based on a short story by Dick) and ""D.O.A."" (the 1950 version not the one made in 1988). Spielberg and Cruise are both consummate storytellers and between them they have generated literally billions and billions of dollars in theater ticket sales -- although this reviewer along with many in the general public did not care for either of their last films that self-indulgent mess ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" and the awful ""Vanilla Sky."" This time out theyve got it right. ""Minority Report"" is a slam-dunk hit. Cruise stars as Chief John Anderton the top dog in the Justice Departments elite Precrime unit. In existence for six years the unit is an experimental police force that arrests people before they can commit murder. So much for that quaint old concept of innocent until proven guilty. George Orwells prophecy of ""Big Brother"" is here; its just a century late. It seems that three ""pre-cogs"" -- people with amazing psychic abilities -- float all day in a big tank and envision murders before they take place. This information is passed on to the authorities who use the clues in the pre-cogs dreams to track down the killers before they can kill.

This new crime force has almost made premeditated murder a thing of the past. Crimes of passion are now the main concern for homicide detectives and those situations always demand split-second timing in order to arrive at the crime scene just before the crime is committed. Future shocks The Precrime program is on the verge of going national and its being touted as the wave of the future. ""What keeps us safe keeps us free"" say the proponents of the program -- chief among them Andertons boss Lamar Burgess played by the legendary Max Von Sydow. Before signing off on national use of the Precrime units the attorney general has sent one of his staff Danny Witner to give it one final check. Witner is played by Colin Farrell and if you dont know who he is you will. This amazing Irish actor equals Cruise in the looks department with a brogue that you can cut with a knife. However his American accent is flawless in this film as it was in the little-seen but wonderful ""Tigerland"" (2001) and the hideous WWII war flick ""Harts War"" (2002). Youll be seeing a lot of Mr. Farrell in the future. Witner and Anderton are both alpha males extremely wary of each other from the get-go as they sniff each other out. Witner isnt so sure about the program but Anderton has complete faith in it -- that is until he finds himself set up as a future murderer and has no choice but to go on the run from his own men. Someone is rigging the system. Anderton has only one option As he says in the film ""Everybody runs."" Smartly done Spielberg does a masterful job of building the dramatic tension while drawing us deeper and deeper into Andertons nightmare. The futuristic touches in the film are wonderful. Apparently Spielberg was advised by numerous ""futurists"" about what in fact could be possible 50 years from now. Video commercials embedded on cereal boxes and computers that run holograms of your home movies are just a few of the nice touches we may -- or may not have -- ahead of us. Of course it all begins with the written word and screenwriters Scott Frank (""Out Of Sight"" 1998) and Jon Cohen have crafted an action-filled thriller that is not totally insulting to the intelligence of a 12-year-old. Very refreshing. Look for little cameos from director Cameron Crowe on a subway and Cruises cousin William Mapother (""In The Bedroom"" 2001) as a hotel clerk. ""Minority Report"" provides the perfect antidote to the lazy hazy days of summer.

Minority Report is a meditation on free will and parenthood in a Big Brother-type society - as well as a bookend to ""A.I.

"Minority Report | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; minority-report ) Minority Report (United States 2002) A movie review by James Berardinelli On those rare occasions when a great motion picture reaches multiplexes the film critic must add another aspect to his or her job description that of cheerleader. It is incumbent upon those of us who routinely dissect movies to applaud the arrival of something like Minority Report. Writing a review isnt enough - we have to get out there and actively stump for the movie. The underlying reason is sound if Minority Report makes a lot of money the studios will be encouraged to fashion more films of this sort. And that is a good thing - not just for science fiction lovers but for fans of intelligent thought-provoking pictures of all genres. For those that must classify Minority Report the primary category is science fiction. After all its based on a short story by celebrated writer Philip K. Dick whose words have been the inspiration for such movies as Blade Runner and Total Recall. But like another genre-crossing motion picture 1998s Dark City Minority Report can also be viewed as an action thriller or a futuristic film noir. It owes a debt to Dashiel Hammett and Raymond Chandler. And Minority Report plays like a different film to different audiences. Those in the mood for the action and adrenaline rush of a typical summer blockbuster will find something to their taste here. Yet there are richer rewards for viewers who are willing to engage their brains. Anyone who wants to think through the mysteries and paradoxes presented herein will discover a multi-course cinematic buffet that can keep the gray matter occupied for days to come. The year is 2054. In many ways the United States is the same five decades into the future as it is today but in other important ways it has changed. Washington D.C. once the murder capital of the union is now the safest place to live - thanks in large part to the Department of Pre-Crime an elite taskforce of law officers who by using the predictive capabilities of three captive ""precogs"" know that a murder is going to happen before it takes place. Armed with that knowledge they can arrest someone before he actually kills saving the victim(s) and preventing the crime. The head of the Department is Director Burgess (Max von Sydow) a dispassionate man who has shepherded the group through eight years of growing pains and is now on the verge of losing control of it as the program goes national. His right hand man Detective John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is in an equally precarious position although Andertons reasons for working in Pre-Crime are different from Burgess. Anderton is on the job because his son was murdered and he wants to prevent other people from having to endure a pain similar to his own. The first part of the movie introduces us to the Pre-Crime squad and shows how they operate by illustrating their attempts to solve Case 1108 - a crime of passion in which a man discovers his wifes infidelity and kills both her and her lover. Once that is successfully wrapped up Minority Report moves on to Case 1109 - the pre-meditated murder of a man by none other than Anderton. Within moments of recognizing that he has run afoul of the system he works for Anderton is in full flight certain that he is being set up by Detective Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) a federal agent who is after his job. Andertons belief in his own innocence is so strong that he even risks breaking into the Pre-Crime building and kidnapping Agatha (Samantha Morton) the most gifted of the three Precogs. He suspects that with her help he can clear himself. But things are not that simple and as the appointed hour of the killing draws nearer Anderton becomes increasingly unprepared for the twists and turns in the road of his fate. Predestination or free will? Its a question that has obsessed philosophers and religious scholars throughout the years. Now it is the underlying subject material of a major motion picture made not for deep thinkers but for a mass audience. To understand where Minority Report is headed one has to ponder whether the future is set and cannot be altered or whether free will makes that future a possibility rather than a certainty. In this case theres an added complication - is the Precogs vision accurate or has it in some way been tampered with? Perhaps Anderton isnt actually going to kill but has been set up by a clever and knowledgeable criminal who wants him out of the way. Such paradoxes and musings lie at the heart of Minority Report. Heres the biggest one of all Is it possible that the act of accusing someone of a murder could begin a chain of events that leads to the slaying. In Andertons situation he runs because he is accused. The only reason he ends up in circumstances where he might be forced to kill is because he is a hunted man. Take away the accusation and there would be no question of him committing a criminal act. The prediction drives the act - a self-fulfilling prophesy. You can see the vicious circle and its delicious (if a little maddening) to ponder. Not since Memento has a movie twisted things this much. Then there are the moral and ethical considerations to explore. Is the safety and security of the populace worth keeping three human beings enslaved? And are people willing to give up a portion of their freedom in order to be safe from murderers? And what about the system itself - is it truly infallible or are innocent men being sent to jail? (This goes back to the question about whether fate is fluid or static.) In fact arent all of these people innocent because they are being captured and tried when no crime has (yet) been committed? Admittedly these are not real-world situations but the underlying ideas resonate in the post-September 11 era when the security/freedom tradeoff has become a often-discussed topic. The screenplay was penned by Scott Frank a man who knows a lot about mysteries and noir thrillers but very little about science fiction. His previous work includes Get Shorty Malice and the phenomenal Dead Again. His script for Minority Report enhanced by Steven Spielberg and Jon Cohen is as compelling. The whodunnit? and whydunnit? elements are as intricately explored and satisfyingly resolved as those in any of the cinemas great noir classics. And to add to the atmosphere Spielberg and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski have filmed this movie as they might a contemporary mystery thriller with muted hues and desaturated color. (At times Minority Report looks almost monochromatic. If it was commercially viable Spielberg might have made this movie in black-and-white.) Action fans have plenty to engage their attention. Minority Report features its share of shoot-outs fights and chase scenes some of which are quite spectacular. A case in point a sequence in which Anderton gets out of his car and leaps from vehicle to vehicle all speeding down a vertical incline in an effort to escape his pursuers. On another occasion theres a lengthy chase that involves jet-propelled backpacks. Finally in an innovative game of hide-and-seek Anderton and Agatha elude their would-be captors by using her precognitive powers to gain the advantage. At one junction she suggests that he throw a few coins to a beggar. He does so and when the man bends to pick up the money Andertons pursuers trip over him. This particular chase is full of clever moments like that. The special effects serve the ingenuity of the script not the other way around. These days many blockbusters offer eye candy without substance. Not so in here where both are available in equal proportions. Spielbergs vision of the future is every bit as eye-popping as that of Ridley Scott in Blade Runner or Luc Besson in The Fifth Element. The computer generated graphics are blended seamlessly with the live-action shots often making it difficult to tell where the effects end and the real-life aspects begin. This is as it should be. Inexperienced directors who throw CGI elements onto the screen should take note of Spielbergs mastery of the technique. For example is there a better use of computer graphics than during the scene in which electronic spiders scurry around a tenement building scanning the retinas of residents as they search for their quarry? From a technological perspective Spielberg did everything he could to achieve a simulacrum of what the world might look like in 50 years. To this end he employed a group of scientists and engineers who approved many of the devices found throughout the film. These include lights and appliances that are voice-activated personal virtual reality commercials that flash on walls as an individual walks past and cars that are no longer earthbound. The choice of Tom Cruise as Anderton is a case of perfect casting. During the past two decades Cruise has proven that he is adept at playing the action hero and handling smaller dramatic roles. For this part he draws a little from both sides. Anderton is an active individual but hes not a superman and he is a better developed character than Cruises Mission Impossible alter-ego. Of course having the name ""Tom Cruise"" on the marquee will not hurt Minority Reports box office performance. Cruises primary support comes from a trio of non-American actors. British actress Samantha Morton returning to the screen after a brief hiatus (during which she had a baby) brings a deeply felt pathos to Agatha. The legendary Max von Sydow who has taken parts in a wide variety of genres for a great many directors plays Andertons boss and friend. And Irishman Colin Farrell who was the title character in Harts War bites into this part with relish. His Danny Witwer is set up as the films villain but his motives may not be as murky as some people believe. In the wake of the disappointment of A.I. Minority Report arrives in theaters representing a much-needed tonic for Spielberg. However this is not just a ""rebound"" picture; its an achievement - arguably the best escapist entertainment the director has produced in two decades. Minority Report rivals some of Spielbergs top adventure/science fiction epics such as Close Encounters and Raiders of the Lost Ark. Whats more it affirms that even in the 2000s movies do not have to be brain-dead to be exciting. When the season is over Minority Report will more than likely stand out as the best picture to grace multiplex screens during the Summer of 2002.

If ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" and ""Blade Runner"" advanced the most provocatively elaborated visions of the near-future for their respective generations then surely ""Minority Report"" offers the most persuasively detailed portrait modern Hollywood has created of what the United States may look like 50 years hence. Steven Spielbergs latest foray into sci-fi territory is also his darkest and most socially relevant as it outfits a straight-ahead man-on-the-run film noir yarn with extraordinary technological postulations as well as a genuinely thoughtful investigation of the suddenly pertinent subject of thwarting anticipated crime before it happens. This outstanding 20th Century Fox/DreamWorks co-venture may be a shade too serious and contemplative to completely enchant the thrill-seeking masses while simultaneously seeming too mainstream-minded and genre-bound to be entirely embraced by highbrows. But the films success is in line with what American films historically have done best which is to excitingly tell a strong story with high style and just enough substance. Combined draw of Tom Cruise Spielberg and sci-fi subject obviously creates outsized B.O. expectations but fact that pic is pitched considerably over the heads of the lowest common denominator will likely keep enough kids away to make this a commercial extra-base hit rather than a home run. Both ""Blade Runner"" which in 1982 envisioned a densely urbanized Los Angeles of 2019 and ""Minority Report"" which depicts a sleek but highly recognizable Washington D.C. of 2054 are based on the fiction of the late Philip K. Dick. Both films portray worlds dominated by extremely sophisticated technology but fraught with a grungy underclass and criminality throughout the social spectrum. And while Ridley Scotts flawed masterpiece which has enjoyed a sustained afterlife despite a disappointing initial release was narratively rooted in hardboiled detective fiction Spielbergs thriller reps a clever twist on such mid-century noirs as ""D.O.A."" in which a poisoned man has 24 hours to find the person who in effect has already killed him. After novelist Jon Cohen adapted Dicks story which was first published in ""Fantastic Universe"" magazine in 1956 for prospective director Jan De Bont Cruise proposed the project to Spielberg who hired Scott Frank (""Out of Sight"") for the rewrite. But even then the undertaking continued to gestate over a long period of delays making this one of those occasional films that was conceived in a very different climate but comes out at a moment when its central theme happens to coincide remarkably with current events a happenstance that will spur significant off-entertainment page commentaries. Superbly handled 15-minute opening sequence grabs the viewer by the lapels while dexterously illustrating the premises central notion of preventing crime by foreseeing it. By analyzing imagery culled from three psychic ""Pre-Cogs"" Pre-Crime unit chief John Anderton (Cruise) is able to piece together enough evidence about a suburban crime of passion in the offing that he and his team arrive in time to stop a jealous husband from stabbing his wife and her lover. The chiefs method of conjuring is marvelously cinematic. Standing before clear panels in his glassed-in control room Anderton resembles a master orchestra conductor as he vigorously summons images from his Pre-Cogs wipes them away reframes them advances and rewinds the action requests new angles -- anything to pick up clues as to location identities and sequence of events. Anderton demonstrably loves what he does and is brilliant at it as well -- so good in fact that D.C. has been murder-free for six years. On the basis of this unblemished success record and the belief that the system is infallible a vote is pending to take Pre-Crime national. A visit to Andertons apartment off-handedly displays some of the films technological propositions for the future magnetic cars that can maneuver horizontally and vertically voice commands for home appliances handy drug inhalers and a 3-D home entertainment center through which is revealed the central trauma of Andertons life the loss six years earlier of his young son. As a cop who no longer lives with his wife and ""experiences"" his son via this vivid electronic visitation Anderton is deeply motivated to save others from the same sort of tragedy that he himself experienced with a loved one -- a point the film drives home. Due to the upcoming referendum a Dept. of Justice ""observer"" Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) begins poking his nose in everywhere and it takes no time for the presumptuous and aggressive former seminarian to put Anderton in his place and announce that his purpose is to find a flaw in the Pre-Crime system. Anderton who jealously guards his pioneering position in the field is further warned by his boss Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow) that Justice is poised to take the whole thing away from them. The protagonist and the film pass through the looking glass at the 40-minute point when Anderton in the course of observing Pre-Cog visions is shocked to see projections of himself committing a murder. This prospect seems not only inconceivable but impossible to him given his absolute faith in Pre-Crime and it instantly leads Anderton to believe that Witwer has set him up. In any event its off to the races with Anderton knowing he has exactly 36 hours until the predicted murder to figure out whats gone awry. At this juncture dramatic format becomes more standard as scenes of Anderton eluding capture and fighting off his former police colleagues are interspersed with one-on-one visits with eccentric characters who can help him toward his goal. Avoiding detection in this day and age is a significant problem because everyone is IDd by eyeball imprint; tiny cameras everywhere can identify citizens usually for work or business purposes (pic gets wonderful mileage out of personalized verbal advertisements bombarding Anderton in a mall) but also for criminal apprehension. The only way around this is an eye transplant which Anderton undertakes at once in a dingy building with a crazed black market physician (a memorably deranged Peter Stormare). In a superior sequence in a greenhouse Anderton learns the meaning of the term Minority Report from the cagey researcher (Lois Smith brilliant) whose insights opened the door on the Pre-Cog system and its disturbing relevance to the situation in which he now finds himself. He also visits his ex-wife Lara (Kathryn Morris) whose tasteful seaside cottage shows a preference for a 1950s lifestyle over a 2050s one and a flashback finally reveals the wrenching accident that resulted in their sons disappearance. Inevitably Andertons path leads to the place where the murder he is supposed to commit has been seen to take place. But there are several twists lying beyond this presumed climax all of which combine to suggest that in a society such as this -- in which everyone is under surveillance and so many things are recorded -- there is precious little that can truly remain secret. But in light of contemporary events surrounding the massive effort to identify and apprehend terrorists before they strike the concept that will be most discussed is the intervention to stop ""criminals"" from actually carrying out criminal acts. Pic treats the matter in a very even-handed way leaving room for consideration and arguments on both sides. From intellectual conception to technical execution of the tiniest detail ""Minority Report"" has been worked out in an exemplary way. Dicks premise is no more or less provocative than those for many other sci-fi stories but so much of whats onscreen feels so close to home that it registers with unusual impact. The world of the film represents a highly credible extension of the one we know with life still dominated by personal emotions and work and the vast encroachments of technology surrendered to for good and ill changing the way people live but no t noticeably altering the quality of life. (Spielberg convened a three-day think tank conference in which leaders in many fields -- science crime transportation architecture health et al. -- weighed in on their visions of the future.) For all its qualities however ""Minority Report"" may in the long run lack the resonance of ""Blade Runner"" and certainly ""2001"" because it is more prosaic than poetic more concerned with narrative progress precise predictions and legalistic issues than larger notions of good and evil fate and the grand scheme of things. The theological note intriguingly struck by Witwer early on is unfortunately never sounded again and while the films rootedness in a future ""reality"" is compelling the emphasis put on this could play a part in preventing the picture from entirely transcending its genre. Dominated by the grainy blueish heavily desaturated cinematography of Janusz Kaminski pic has a virtually seamless look in which many layers of visual elements have been superbly combined. Initial crime-imaging has a borderline avant-garde tilt and it would take close study to get a full grasp of the films extensive technical accomplishments. Alex McDowells protean production design dazzlingly presents three aspects of the nations capital -- official Washington which looks much as it does today; the run-down city proper with its ancient 20th century structures and the towering glass-and-steel outskirts which like the Pre-Crime HQ is meant to rep the latest in design and construction techniques some 40-50 years hence. Deborah L. Scotts costume creations are attractive but modest variations on modern notions of hip and John Williams supplies an energetically supportive score. On the performance side this is about as good as it gets where Cruise is concerned. Anderton is both an action and an emotive role and while the character is an obsessed and distraught individual Cruise doesnt overdo it on either score registering a genuinely involving and effective turn that makes ideal use of his movie star status without relying on it. As his nemesis Farrell is outstanding pugnaciously invading Andertons (and Cruises) space to establish himself as a genuinely threatening adversary; perf for the first time reasserts the quicksilver talent that was so widely noted in Farrells American debut in ""Tigerland."" Samantha Morton who plays one of the three Pre-Cogs is confined to lying in a pool for a good stretch but brings a terrific physical intensity to her unique role when she is finally liberated and is central to one of the most memorable scenes in the picture in which Anderton attempts to elude capture in a mall. Von Sydow has the perfect voice of authority as the ""father of Pre-Crime"" and the many small supporting roles have for the most part been expertly filled.

Share Tweet What keeps us safe keeps us free"" declares a propagandistic advertisement for the controversial Pre-Crime Division of the Washington D.C. police force a unit that uses three visionary ""Precogs"" (short for ""precognizant"") to apprehend would-be killers before they kill. The inherent contradiction of the ""safety is freedom"" proverb seems as lost on the leaders of 2002 as it does on the ones in 2054 which is only part of what gives Steven Spielbergs astonishing Minority Report such enormous relevance and power. After collaborating directly with the late Stanley Kubrick for last years grossly underrated A.I. Spielberg returns to the science-fiction genre for a natural companion piece framing profound ethical and philosophical questions in the form of dazzling pop entertainment. Expanding on a Philip K. Dick short story the film could be the mirror image of Kubricks A Clockwork Orange only instead of violent crime being deterred after the fact the perpetrators are arrested before it happens. Free will is lost in both cases but the certainty is enough for Tom Cruise a ""future crimes"" detective who synthesizes the visions of three Precogs like hes conducting a virtual orchestra. Haunted by the abduction of his young son which he believes the system might have prevented Cruise and his team have been so successful (no murders in six years) that the program is readying for a national launch under the leadership of political operative Max von Sydow. But as Federal Agent Colin Farrell noses around his unit Cruises name comes up for the future murder of a man hes never even met leaving him 36 hours to stave off his destiny and get to the bottom of this supposed frame-up. Few directors are capable of marrying ideas and entertainment--one is often sacrificed for the other--but Spielberg peppers one gripping action setpiece after another with trenchant details about a near-future robbed of the most basic freedoms and privacy. In a world where advertisers can pitch directly to individuals from ubiquitous screens and holographs human beings are marked like cookies on a web page so haunted by technology that even a cereal box can recognize them. Seamlessly integrating the special effects into the story without calling too much attention to them Spielberg and his artisans paint the real D.C. in a virtual glaze turning the city into a shimmering creature where inanimate objects come alive to the touch. Convenience and safety become paramount virtues but the film predicts some grim consequences to a future thats currently in the making not just to civil liberties but to the very notion of free will. With all these fascinating ideas in the air plus a couple of beautifully choreographed suspense sequences worthy of Brian DePalma its disappointing that the script writes itself into a corner ending with a run of whodunit cliches. But even when it bends to overweening ambition Minority Report finds Spielberg in peak form as a craftsman and an artist boldly advancing the medium with the message.
