He thinks his way into moments that other actors would coast through on autopilot. As George ""Iceman"" Chambers a world heavyweight champion who is stripped of his title and sent to prison on a rape charge (the implication though never definitive is that hes been railroaded) Ving Rhames in Undisputed is playing a less flaky more self-controlled variation on Mike Tyson. But Rhames with a shaved head a protective scowl and a deliberate dead-aim voice that is nearly musical in its soft threat never allows you to pigeonhole the character. He builds him layer by layer like a psychological brick wall showing you Icemans raw physical power the fearless even merry way he uses that power in tandem with his mind and finally something more complex - a pride in his invincibility thats his triumph and just maybe his downfall. In prison the more that Iceman tries to isolate himself the more everyone wants a piece of him. His celebrity makes him both a demigod and a target and so its all but preordained that hell have to climb into the ring with Monroe Hutchen (Wesley Snipes) a convicted murderer who was once a rising boxing star and has never yet lost a prison bout. Perhaps the best work from director Walter Hill since ""The Warriors"" (1979) ""Undisputed"" is a shrewd and splendidly volatile B movie structured around a highly original gambit of suspense. As played by Rhames and Snipes who gains intensity by tamping down on his blade-edged cool both of these hard cases are quite charismatic and so the outcome of the big match isnt at all clear. Lets just say that this is one fight to the finish too lively to produce any real losers.

After a stretch of questionable projects like ""Last Man Standing"" and ""Supernova"" Hill has rebounded with a boxing pic so purely pugilistic that nothing impinges on the main event. With ""Undisputed"" writer-director Walter Hill is back in contention as one of Hollywoods last defenders of the muscular no-nonsense genre movie. After a stretch of questionable projects like ""Last Man Standing"" and ""Supernova"" Hill has rebounded with a boxing pic so purely pugilistic that nothing impinges on the main event Wesley Snipes and Ving Rhames battling to a knockout in a prison boxing ring. B.O. decision may be extremely mixed with women wanting to pass this one up indicating pics real punch may be in ancillary. Given the scuttling of original November 2001 release and several changed release dates since plus much-discussed reshoots to which Snipes took public exception as well as more producers than you could put in a fighters corner ""Undisputeds"" late-summer arrival isnt auspicious. But any follower of Hills work from ""The Warriors"" and ""48 HRS"" on will quickly realize this is a movie he was born to make and his universe of hardened men living by their own rules outside societys mainstream has rarely received better expression. Hill and co-writer and producing partner David Giler have seemingly borrowed from Mike Tysons life for the boxer-in-jail theme and pic gets right down to business with a bout in the so-called combat cage of Californias maximum security Mojave Desert-based Sweetwater prison. Defending his undefeated jailhouse crown is Monroe Hutchens (Snipes) a lifer who was once a ranked heavyweight contender. He quickly dispatches his opponent a white supremacist toughie (the fearsome Nils Allen Stewart). Sizing up Monroes latest knockout is aging mobster Mendy Ripstein (Peter Falk) a self-made scholar in the sweet science. Meanwhile the prisoners await the arrival of current world heavyweight champ Iceman Chambers (Rhames) convicted -- a la Tyson -- of raping a woman (Rose Rollins seen retelling her side of the story for a tell-all tabloid TV show). Supremely full of himself even when he arrives in shackles at Sweetwater Iceman acts from the start like he owns the joint. Naturally he scoffs at the notion that the prison has its own champ in Monroe and he wastes no time throwing a punch at the champ in the lunchroom. ""Undisputed"" doesnt distract from itself with subplots. Early sections detailing Icemans case are delivered concisely (aided by the presence of real-life boxing commentator Jim Lampley) with pic quickly moving on to the central conflict. Hill crafts a drama that we know will end with Iceman and Monroe in the ring together and he doesnt excessively postpone the inevitable. Still pic manages to crank up the tension with Iceman waging a one-man war against the entire inmate population and a full-scale riot never seemingly far off. A juicy part of the buildup is handled by Falk in his most colorful role in years; while one monologue comes off as a parody of his long-ago work with Cassavetes another is a classic of subtle intimidation. His Mendy cleverly devises an arrangement that ensures both a Monroe-Iceman bout and Icemans early release from prison. When it come time for the climax pic delivers one of the most physically intense fight sequences since ""Raging Bull"" -- and one in which Snipes and Rhames visibly did all the fighting. Appropriately enough the bout has no ref and can only end by KO. With good effect Hills camera uses the same eavesdropping telephoto perspective he features earlier in the film playing up the stunning nearly 20-minute display of pure body-to-body violence. Capper is true to pics straight-ahead attack. That same no-nonsense style is adopted by the impeccably cast ensemble distinguished by Snipes thankfully underplaying a man who buries his deepest emotions until he gets in the ring and Rhames in a fabulous display of exultant sinewy stardom. Support each with at least one moment to shine is aces particularly Wes Studi as Icemans reluctant cellmate and sparring partner. Production is flawed only by a repetitive white-flash transition effect but otherwise concocts several effective onscreen moods from peeping Tom lensing to claustrophobic tight angles to the spectacle of the match true to Icemans proclamation that he isnt an athlete but a gladiator.

This prison-based boxing picture is directed by veteran Walter Hill who during his prime specialized in bare-bones melodramas redeemed by narrative drive and whose only accoutrements were seductively lurid visuals (The Warriors Streets of Fire). Here hes reduced to a grungy facility and sweaty protagonists in the Mojave Desert. Wesley Snipes may get top billing but co-star Ving Rhames isnt taking second place to many these days especially not in this movie. Bragging thats he is ""not an athlete but a warrior"" Rhames Iceman Chambers is a world heavyweight champion recently imprisoned on a rape charge. (Which real-life boxer do you think inspired this guy?) Adamantly denying the rap -- though his victim (Rose Rollins) is convincing -- he learns that convicted murderer Snipes reigns undefeated in prison contests. So after a heated rumble in the dining hall between the two a match is quickly hatched. Every character is drawn broadly and none more so than Peter Falk as a tax evader and in-house boxing expert so prone to using the f-word that one can imagine Joe Pescis agent advising his client ""You were there 10 years ago -- pass."" As the warden Denis Arndt is even more of a cartoon than the rest and is good for laughs that may or may not be intentional. The climactic final bout takes up a fifth of the 90-minute pictures running time (less if you bail during the end credits) and its at least clear that its Snipes and Rhames together in the ring. After being held back this is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in September. It probably would have been more fun to see Rhames in an arm-wrestling contest with Vin Diesel.

Photo credits Ron Batzdorff (HANDOUT PHOTO) Photo HANDOUT Undisputed has integrity 1 / 1 Back to Gallery UNDISPUTED Drama. Starring Wesley Snipes Ving Rhames and Peter Falk. Directed by Walter Hill. (R. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Undisputed"" is a fight movie that never becomes more than a fight movie that never escapes its predictable formula. Yet within its B-movie limits it has a certain B-movie integrity -- a muscular commitment to grabbing the viewers eye and keeping things moving. It wont win any awards but it holds interest. The picture benefits from the direction of Walter Hill (""48 HRS."") who after 30 years in the business still isnt directing like an elder statesman. The boxing scenes which take place in a maximum-security prison are examples of kinetic editing and stage setting used to create an atmosphere and evoke a mood. Wesley Snipes plays Monroe the undisputed heavyweight boxing champion of the California prison system. In the opening scene we see him pummeling a huge skinhead inside a caged-off ring while outside the inmates who watch from a tiered gallery go berserk. Hill is welcoming us to an entirely male universe where everyone has at least one Y chromosome and some probably have two. Its a scary primal place but with a certain gut-level fascination. ""Undisputed"" has two heavyweights playing heavyweights. The other is Ving Rhames as the Iceman the real-world heavyweight champion a legendary scrapper who has just been convicted of raping a woman. She came to his room in the middle of the night and either changed her mind or didnt depending on whom you believe. Its an obvious reference to the case of Mike Tyson but Rhames is more appealing and has a much deeper voice. So thats the setup Two undisputed heavyweight champions in the same prison on a collision course. Theyre going to have to go at it sooner or later -- but we know it has to be later because that fight is the one item in the movies bag of tricks. While waiting for the big fight we can be amused by the colorful character work of Peter Falk who plays Mendy an old Jewish mobster who talks with his lips tight as if trying to keep his teeth in his mouth. Mendy cant get through a sentence without saying the f-word two or three times which is not just comical but also realistic for a certain kind of old-timer. Hes a fight aficionado broken down in body but with quick eyes who can spot talent. Combat in all its variety is the one thing he knows. The character touches throughout ""Undisputed"" are a cut above the ordinary. Snipes plays Monroe as a fellow who has developed a preternatural calm because the one time he flew off the handle he committed a crime of passion and ended up in prison. He methodically puts together little wooden sculptures with toothpicks a reverse metaphor for his boxing style. He doesnt rely on one blow but on a whole series to gradually take apart an opponent. The script which Hill wrote with producer David Giler does two smart things It doesnt strive to make Iceman and Monroe come to like and respect each other and it doesnt make one the hero and the other the villain. Iceman may be an egomaniac and a possible felon (its never clear whether he really did rape the woman) but Rhames gives him a warriors dignity. At least he has courage and that counts for a lot. Still the script can go only so far -- not only are there no surprises but there also can be no surprises -- so that for all of Hills effort ""Undisputed"" still seems routine and its hold on the audience is casual. We might like it and even appreciate it but if the film snapped in the middle no one would be brokenhearted.
