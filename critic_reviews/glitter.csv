Years later her high-octave talents are discovered on New Yorks early-80s club scene by maverick DJ Dice (Beesley) who becomes Billies manager and lover. Several tiffs and much schmaltz later shes set to sell out Madison Square Garden - despite the (puzzling) fact that shes still able to roam Manhattan without being recognised. This fails to convince on several levels Careys assumed edginess; Beesleys faltering Brooklyn accent; turns from such celebs as rapper Da Brat and soul vocalist Eric Benet; the half-hearted 80s references and the haphazard retro effects.

"CNN.com - No sparkle in Glitter - September 25 2001 MAIN PAGE WORLD U.S. WEATHER BUSINESS SPORTS POLITICS LAW SCI-TECH SPACE HEALTH ENTERTAINMENT TRAVEL EDUCATION IN-DEPTH VIDEO LOCAL CNN NEWSWATCH E-MAIL SERVICES CNNtoGO ABOUT US/HELP CNN TV whats on show transcripts CNN Headline News CNN International askCNN EDITIONS CNN.com Asia CNN.com Europe CNNenEspanol.com CNNArabic.com set your edition Languages --------- Spanish Portuguese German Italian Korean Arabic Japanese Time Inc. --------- Time.com People Fortune EW InStyle Business 2.0 No sparkle in Glitter By Paul ClintonCNN Reviewer (CNN) -- Dozens of pundits have predicted a change in the types of films Americans will turn to in this time of national crises. ""No more Independence Days (1996) and no more Armageddons (1998) in Hollywoods future"" is the common chant. Escapism in entertainment will be the name of the game in the months to come they say. If that is indeed the case ""Glitter"" starring Mariah Carey should be a smash hit. This film is total escapism without a shred of believability. But it isnt a hit and that may be because its not a very good movie. However if you keep your expectations very very low (you may even get a case of the bends) ""Glitter"" is somewhat entertaining. The story is sort of a mixture of ""Purple Rain"" (1984) and ""A Star Is Born"" (1937 1954 1976) with elements of Careys own life story thrown in too. Actually the treatment for this rags-to-riches story was written by Carey with the final script being penned by Kate Lanier (""Whats Love Got To Do With It?""). Amazingly Carey who has been taking acting lessons is not a bad actress. Albeit she is merely playing herself in this film but her thespian talents are better then those of her fellow diva Whitney Houston. Of course thats not saying much.

In the movie ""Glitter"" Billie Frank (Mariah Carey) and boyfriend Julian Dice (Max Beesley) are greeted by the press after arriving at a gala event. Photo HO Glitter reveals Carey can pose but not act 1 / 1 Back to Gallery GLITTER Romance. Starring Mariah Carey Max Beesley. Directed by Vondie Curtis Hall. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) As a singer Mariah Carey shows incredible range. As an actress she shows impressively white teeth. Carey doesnt completely embarrass herself in ""Glitter"" her screen debut. She nails some lines and at times shows a surprising innocence. But shes so self-aware -- of the facial expressions that will best maintain her flawless makeup job and of keeping her cascade of hair lying just so -- that shes really posing instead of acting. It doesnt help that ""Glitter"" is such a derivative mishmash of cinematic and real-life situations that its nearly impossible to count all the ways. But here goes nothing Mariah plays a singer named Billie as in Holiday as in the role diva Diana Ross played to great acclaim in her first starring role; Billie gets discovered by a music bigwig and they fall in love a la Carey and Sony honcho Tommy Mottola; the characters mentor though is a hotshot 80s DJ -- like Jellybean Benitez who helped jump-start lover Madonnas career. Finally -- and this is a big one since its the entire story -- Billies star rises as her lovers fades and he becomes a self-destructive lout. Its ""A Star Is Born"" redux -- and reduced to cliches. The stress of making the movie supposedly contributed to Careys recent breakdown and we can see why she was worried. The attraction between Billie and Dice (English actor Max Beesley trying and failing to mask his accent with a New Yawk honk) is obvious Both look about a decade older than the club denizens theyre supposed to be. He recognizes her octave-hopping vocal acrobatics makes a demo and gets her signed to a label. In a flash she and two backup singers top the charts with a synthesizer groove thats straight out of the Mary Jane Girls. Enter cartoonishly snarky music-industry types who elbow out Dice and outfit Billie in as little as possible. In but one of their dastardly acts they want Billie to wear only a bikini for her video -- a setup thats a tad disingenuous considering Careys fashion track record. Nobody forced her to put on that two-piece for her ""Butterfly"" video for instance. The music rivals the story in lack of originality. Boy genius Dice in a revelation orders a studio engineer to strip the excess noise and isolate a bass track. His uncovered gem? The Cameo hit ""Candy."" Billies biggest song in the movie ""I Didnt Mean to Turn You On"" is a remake of the disco staple. ""Glitter"" inspires several unintentional laughs like a sex scene that goes from discreet disrobing to postcoital bliss in a millisecond. The rest of the time the movie just dawdles. Carey looks wounded but perfectly coiffed as Billie moons over Dice; Dice becomes more unpredictable but somehow still boring; Carey sings a milquetoast duet with Eric Benet. Director Vondie Curtis Hall who made the compelling ""Gridlockd"" but somehow signed on for this mess wastes the only two actors who invigorate the tired story. Rapper Da Brat as Billies backup singer steals every scene shes in with comic double-takes and silly dance moves and Terrence Howard (""Big Mommas House"") one of todays best screen villains drips with menace as a rival record producer. But theyre shunted to the side in service to the love story. Its unclear why the film was set in the 80s other than to allow Carey to sing disco songs. Those looking for the decadence of ""The Rose"" or even ""Rock Star"" will be disappointed. Careys character is a goody-two-shoes throughout save for one very mild diva tantrum. Carey obviously was concerned with protecting her image and fan base. She should have loosened up instead. In an early scene she dances to Blondies ""Heart of Glass"" showing a sensuality unlike anything in her kittenish early videos or her prepackaged hoochie-mama recent stuff. The scene hints at what the movie might have been -- less glittery more gaudy and at least an interesting failure rather than just a bland one. --Advisory This film contains raw language sexuality violence.

Her face which looks as if its been composed entirely of oversize cheekbones has no lines no crinkles and no expressions either. It has instead two modes smiling Mariah (a happy flash of toothpaste-commercial pearly whites) and neutral Mariah (hootchie girl caught in headlights). Shes present but with no more presence than a mannequin. That said its doubtful that even a real actress could have triumphed over the rusty tinsel of ""Glitter"" a hapless retro-80s ""Star Is Born"" that casts her as Billie a New York backup singer who becomes a star through the efforts of Dice (Max Beesley) a down-with-the-homeboys club DJ who installs himself as her producer promoter boyfriend and abusive over-controlling noodge. Beesley who looks like a long-lost Wahlberg brother has the on-screen potency that Carey lacks but Dice has been conceived as such a mindless small- timer that the bigger Billie gets the less sense his character - or their relationship - makes. Directed sad to say by the promising Vondie Curtis Hall (""Gridlockd"") ""Glitter"" barely even allows Carey to do much singing. She looks truly comfortable only when Billie is cradling the one character in the movie more passive than she is - her cat.

Having gone through a few different titles on its ignominious path to the bigscreen ""Glitter"" deserves yet another title ""A Star Is Dull."" As phony a vehicle as one could possibly concoct for a wannabe movie star pic carries Mariah Carey into a swamp of gloppy melodrama. As Careys alter-ego Billie Frank rises to the top her makeup is never out of place but that is about the only thing thats visibly correct about Careys uncomfortable debut performance. Postponed release dates and Careys chronicled emotional breakdown are actually the least of the projects problems -- the greatest being the project itself. Although ""Glitter"" will draw Careys passionately loyal fan base for opening weekend after that pic is on a song and a prayer. An eight-minute prelude profiling young Billie (Isabel Gomes) and her struggling singer mom Lillian (Valarie Pettiford) is shot by lenser Geoffrey Simpson under Vondie Curtis-Halls direction with some sensitivity and atmospherics stylized with a modified bleached-color process. The mother-daughter tale is instantly maudlin -- tragedy forces Lillian to put Billie in a foster home -- but it does send out hopeful hints that Hall may be continuing down the promising path he started on in his first work behind the camera ""Gridlockd."" Those hopes are immediately dashed as the action rushes forward to 1983 when a sexy grown-up Billie is dancing with fellow singer-dancers Louise (Da Brat) and Roxanne (Tia Texada) in what looks like a replica of Studio 54. Billies gals get on her case when she rejects hot producer Timothy Walkers (Terrence Howard) offer to join him as a backup group. It seems Billies instincts were right when Walker records her voice so that statuesque but tone-deaf lead singer Sylk (Padma Lakshmi) need only lip-synch but a chance encounter with equally hot DJ Julian Dice (Max Beesley) proves Billies big break. ""You got sumpin special"" Julian notes and he wastes no time cutting a demo tape of her soloing and more darkly working out a deal with Walker who demands 100000 for the rights to Billies contract. Ever the operator Julian gets the tape into the hands of CMZ Records Aamp;R honchos Guy (Dorian Harewood) and Jack (Grant Nickalls) who promptly sign her. Then its on to a whirlwind of happy recording sessions and an unhappy video shoot which this manifestly silly movie has the nerve to lampoon. Over half of ""Glitters"" running time is a series of procedural steps up the ladder of success but Cheryl L. Wests story and Kate Laniers script reduce Billie to the role of spectator -- as if somebody else is dragging her up that ladder and shes just making sure she doesnt lose her footing. Such an overwhelmingly passive central character is bad enough but Carey a pop star playing a pop star looks puzzled as to how to bring her character alive. Billie may be directed by an increasing army of handlers but no amount of handling appears to help Carey make any scene even remotely genuine. When the label recruits another producer to turn Billie into a dance diva Julian feels hes being pushed out making this mostly Julians drama and finally tragedy. This puts much of the weight on Beesleys shoulders and though the Brit thesp responds with a performance in thoroughly American guise hes made to resemble Mark Wahlberg to an absurd degree. Beesley also gets the lions share of the worst lines especially when Julian lapses near the end into apologetic mode and the final picture is of a promising actor trapped in an impossible role. Hall and editor Jeff Freeman unimaginatively pace these ups and downs like a TV drama bridging scenes with repeated ""NYPD Blue""-style whip pans across Manhattan. Two shots feature the now-destroyed World Trade Center and though theres no reason to cut them out since action is set some 15 years ago there is one awkward result Immediately after one such shot Careys Billie is seen wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the word ""Bombshell."" Carey who also served as music producer dominates the all-important tracks with her breathy warbling but her 90s-era contempo Ramp;B sound isnt demonstrably altered to fit the 80s. Amid standard-issue production credits the props -- especially several music instruments -- are period-perfect.

In fact Glitter the pop star Mariah Careys feature film debut is mostly dross an unintentionally hilarious compendium of time-tested cinematic clichAA(c)s that illustrates the chasm between hopeful imitation and successful duplication. In the role of Billie Frank Ms. Carey filmed mostly to focus attention on her gleaming white smile and the amplitude of a bosom accented by tight or low-cut tops is simply inadequate as an actress to the relatively undemanding emotional range of the story. Directed by Vondie Curtis Hall from a screenplay by Kate Lanier whose credits include the Tina Turner musical biography Whats Love Got To Do With It? Glitter never approaches its objective to be a heart-tugging tale of a rags-to-pop-royalty climb made poignant by love and loss. Throughout a screening in a Times Square theater the other night the audience erupted repeatedly into laughter at scenes intended to carry emotional weight and the only sight that roused the onlookers to applause was the World Trade Center visible in one of the many fleeting swirling overheard views of New York City that seem intended to invest this listless flop with sorely needed glamour and excitement. Musically the only crowds excited by the singing in this film for which Ms. Carey also takes a credit as the executive music director and a co-writer of several songs are the extras who appear in its raves and in a climactic Madison Square Garden performance and who presumably were paid in some form for expressing their enthusiasm. The best number in the film the smoky melancholy Lillies Blue written by Ms. Carey James Harris III and Terry Lewis is rendered by Valarie Pettiford while the extended opening credits are rolling. Ms. Pettiford portrays Billies mother Lillian Frank whose singing performance in a nondescript bar sets the plot rolling when she summons her talented little girl (Isabel Gomes as the young Billie) to join her at the mike. Later at the door of his town house Billies dad peeling off some 100 bills as conscience money makes it clear that he wants no part of either Lillian or the angelic Billie and when Lillians careless smoking habits burn mother and child out of their home Lillian has to surrender Billie to the welfare authorities. The separation is a traumatizing event that the audience is asked to believe colors Billies life in the years to come. Clutching her marmalade-color cat Whiskers -- whose sudden reappearance later in the film perhaps by then at the age of 200 in cat years gives Glitter its biggest unintended laugh -- Billie enters the modern equivalent of a Dickensian orphanage. The film then jumps to 1983 when a grown-up Billie now portrayed by Ms. Carey is singing backup with her childhood pals and current roommates Louise (Da Brat) and Roxanne (Tia Texada) for a beauteous no-talent Sylk (Padma Lakshmi) who is managed by the slick Timothy Walker (Terrence Howard). No fool Walker uses Billies voice to ghost for Sylks on a recording but a shrewd young disc jockey and producer Dice (Max Beesley) quickly spots the ruse. Pursuing Billie he promises stick with me and youll be singing in Madison Square Garden. Before she knows it Billie has a contract with a big-time label and is having her image shaped by a couple of publicity agents and a video director who stop just short of suggesting that they were slipped into the script by Mel Brooks as a practical joke. In addition Billie haunted by the loss of the mother she dreams of finding once more overcomes her problems with trust and beds down with Dice. But as Billies career waxes Dices wanes; and unbeknownst to Billie Timothy Walker wants 100000 that Dice promised him for surrendering her contract as a backup singer. Trouble of the sort that feeds the tabloids where Ms. Careys emotional difficulties have been recorded in recent months is waiting to happen. Unfortunately in Glitter Billies plight evokes only derisive laughter. Glitter is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes some crude language appropriate to its characters and a sex scene shown through slats that made the audience laugh.

"USATODAY.com - Despite Mariahs pipes Glitter is definitely not gold Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 09/20/2001 - Updated 0418 PM ET Despite Mariahs pipes Glitter is definitely not gold By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Glitter (out of four) Stars Mariah Carey Max Beesley Eric Benet Da Brat Tia Texada Director Vondie Curtis-Hall Distributor 20th Century Fox Rating PG-13 for some sensuality language and brief violence Mariah Carey in all her Glitter-y glory essentially has the weekend to herself. But even being alone in the box office spotlight wont add luster to her dim bulb of a movie. The pop music diva gets her first starring role in this maudlin rags-to-riches tale. The story line -- a girl abandoned by her mother goes on to find love and superstardom but winds up lonely after all -- is a tired one. Even the soundtrack doesnt rescue the movie from its tedious banality. At least Carey as singer Billie Frank can warble a tune. There is even less to recommend in Max Beesley who plays Dice her producer-DJ boyfriend whose love devolves into jealousy. These have not been easy times for Carey She has been hospitalized twice after an emotional breakdown; her recent single Loverboy languished on radio; and the Glitter soundtrack premiered last week to less-than-spectacular sales. Now as she attempts to launch a movie career it appears a shimmering film star has not been born. Careys acting ability doesnt come close to the potency of her pipes. Her range of emotion covers the gamut from simpering grin to perky smile to pouty crocodile tears. Wisely she was not given many lines and spends a good portion of the movie singing dancing or just listening with muted animation (sporting the same wide-eyed grinning expression) while others yak. And banter is not the movies strong suit. When Billie spies a photo of Dice as a boy she quips ""So cute. What happened?"" His equally clever comeback ""Youre funny."" At one point the camera inexplicably leaves her to follow two burly furniture movers heaving a bed around a narrow hallway. Its as if even the camera operator tired of her one-note performance and sought distraction. One of the most unintentionally hilarious scenes involves an orange tabby cat. Billie is shown clutching the kitty when she is first separated from her mother then the cat is not seen for more than a decade -- until Billie leaves home again this time after fighting with Dice. She walks the streets of New York City clamping the undoubtedly senile feline to her chest. The movies moment of truth may come when Dice asks Billie ""Do you really think that because you swing your -- - -- around and hit a few high notes that youre some colossal success?"" She has no answer for him.
