In the first instalment Alex the dancing lion and his mismatched cohorts escaped from a New York zoo on a mission to reach Africa. They missed and wound up on Madagascar instead. Roll on part two and Alex (voice of Ben Stiller) et al are on board a home-made aircraft bound for Africa where they hope finally to meet members of their own species. The film then shatters into a trillion plotlets involving reunions rites of passage water shortages volcanic sacrifices even a little romantic interaction. Yet despite this splintered storyline the film manages to remain more coherent than the last. The animation too is improved. Great pre-Chrimbo fun for under-tens then but a chore for anyone else. Tip for best results see it in gigantiscope at the IMAX.

"Madagascar Escape 2 Africa stars the voices of Chris Rock David Schwimmer Jada Pinkett Smith - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Madagascar Escape 2 Africa stars the voices of Chris Rock David Schwimmer Jada Pinkett SmithRating 3 stars (good)November 07 2008|By Michael Phillips TRIBUNE CRITICMADAGASCAR ESCAPE 2 AFRICA ""Madagascar"" (2005) made half a bil and my preteen son certainly enjoyed it especially for the penguins. The sequel ""Madagascar Escape 2 Africa"" is a better film though -- less manic more easygoing. The first film referenced so many other movies so indiscriminately from ""Chariots of Fire"" to ""Planet of the Apes"" to ""American Beauty"" watching it was like being caught on a bus with a bunch of screenwriters on the way to a wisenheimer convention. The new one lays off that stuff and while there are booger jokes and such youll likely avoid that ""Over the Hedge"" headache so many of these critter outings instill.Screenwriter-directors Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath were joined this time by co-writer Etan Cohen. Marooned on Madagascar Alex the lion (voice by Ben Stiller) Marty the zebra (Chris Rock) Melman the paranoid hypochondriac giraffe (David Schwimmer) and hippo Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith) yearn for home in the Central Park Zoo where starry-eyed egocentric Alexs antics have made him ""king of New York."" The penguins rig up an old busted plane slingshot fashion and zing the quartet (plus stowaways) not to Manhattan but to Africa somewhere near Mt. Kilimanjaro.From there ""Escape 2 Africa"" begins a serious poaching session on ""Lion King"" territory. Alex finds his parents -- the late Bernie Mac provides the voice of daddy Zuba big mane on campus -- and with obvious allusions to Scar in ""The Lion King"" Alec Baldwin lends his sterling basso distrusto voice to jealous Makunga a petty and venal lion indeed who exploits naive showbizzy Alex for his own political gain.When I say ""Escape 2 Africa"" goes easy on the pop-culture jokes I should clarify One of the smarter things in the script is how Alex who digs his Bob Fosse and Jerome Robbins dance moves becomes the films primary pop-cult gag. (When he suits up for ceremonial battle his war paint includes a dandy pair of tragic/comic masks.) This allows the rest of the movie to spread out and ease up in other ways exploring other avenues. And naturally most of the elements that made ""Madagascar"" all those mils are back including lemur leader King Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen) and the song -- the song -- ""I Like to Move It.""The visual style is typical ultracrisp computer animation bright sharp somewhat clinical. I took my kid and three of his pals to an IMAX screening and while I couldve done without the films martial arts slapstick involving the cranky old outer-borough lady on safari in a role expanded from her Grand Central Station cameo in the first picture well if theres one thing parenthood teaches anybody in this country its that boys rarely fail to laugh at someone gettin it in the nads from a senior citizen.Reviews from our 2nd-grade posse ""Really liked it."" ""Four billion stars."" ""Five billion stars.""- - -MPAA rating PG (for some mild crude humor)Running time 128 Opening FridayStarring the voices of Ben Stiller (Alex); Chris Rock (Marty); David Schwimmer (Melman); Jada Pinkett Smith (Gloria); Sacha Baron Cohen (King Julien); Cedric The Entertainer (Maurice); Bernie Mac (Zuba); Sherri Shepherd (Mama Lion); Alec Baldwin (Makunga); will.i.am (Moto Moto); Andy Richter (Mort)Directed by Eric Darnell; written by Etan Cohen Darnell and Tom McGrath; music by Hans Zimmer; production design by Kendal Cronkhite; art direction by Shannon Jeffries; visual effects supervised by Philippe Gluckman; produced by Mireille Soria and Mark Swift.

Instead they maroon them on the African mainland for what amounts to more of the same a shrill retread of the 2005 animated hit ""Madagascar."" Voice stars Ben Stiller Chris Rock David Schwimmer and Jada Pinkett Smith return along with Sacha Baron Cohen and Cedric the Entertainer. Operating on the principle that the bigger the menagerie the merrier the movie the filmmakers tack on fresh characters to the point of distraction with the late Bernie Mac among the newcomers as dad to Stillers Alex the lion. Whether or not theyve seen or remember the original flick young kids will eat up this manic mess a nonstop rush of slapstick and jabbering dialogue. The noise and mayhem will annoy or at least bore most parents who can take some solace in the movies brisk running time. Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath who made the first movie return to direct and co-write ""Escape 2 Africa"" with Etan Cohen sharing screenplay credit. They keep the story simple picking up where ""Madagascar"" left Alex and his fellow pampered zoo animals Marty the zebra (Rock) Melman the giraffe (Schwimmer) and Gloria the hippo (Pinkett Smith). Still stranded in Madagascar off the mainland coast the foursome strap in to a derelict plane rebuilt by their pesky penguin comrades for the return to New York. The rickety contraption crashes on the plains of Africa where Alex is reunited with his parents (Mac and Sherri Shepherd) from whom he was separated as a toddler after poachers captured him. Alec Baldwin chimes in as a devious lion conniving to oust Mac as leader of the pride while Cohen delivers another obnoxious vocal turn as lemur King Julien with Cedric back as his flunky. Co-director McGrath reprises his vocals for penguin boss Skipper again eerily sounding like the ghost of Phil Hartman doing one of his voices for ""The Simpsons."" Singer will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas is a Barry White sound-alike as ladies man hippo. To its credit ""Escape 2 Africa"" does maintain a distinct visual style amid todays animation overload of cookie-cutter critters that blend together from one movie to the next. The landscapes are vast and vivid while the geometric shapes that go into the characters design lend them a distinct look. With so many characters to cram in and not much for many of them to do ""Escape 2 Africa"" ends up a choppy episodic affair. The main players all have their own little subplots Alex aiming to prove himself to papa Marty trying to find his individuality among a herd of indistinguishable zebras Gloria looking for love and Melman desperate to show that hes the man for her despite their extreme genetic differences. Giraffe-hippo romance aside theres nothing remotely challenging -- or for the most part interesting -- about any of this. Children who were big fans of the first movie just three years ago may have long since outgrown the superficiality served up in the sequel. ""Madagascar Escape 2 Africa"" a DreamWorks Animation release runs 89 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.

Now DreamWorks seems to have jettisoned this goal in favor of lucrative flicks strictly targeted to the knee-high set. So it is with ""Madagascar Escape 2 Africa"" a by-the-numbers follow-up to the highly successful 2005 feature that was no great shakes to begin with. Yes it looks a little better and moving the action from Manhattan to Africa is probably an improvement. But its not something youd particularly want to watch with the kids. And even some of them seemed restless at the screening I attended. Stranded in Madagascar at the end of the last film the gang from the Central Park Zoo - Alex the dancing lion (voiced by Ben Stiller) Marty the wisecracking zebra (Chris Rock) Melman the hypochondriac giraffe (David Schwimmer) and Gloria the lovelorn hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) - are trying to get home on a plane thats been shakily rehabbed by the penguins. This gets them only as far as the African nature preserve from which Alex was stolen reuniting him with his dad (the late Bernie Mac) and his mom (Sherri Shepherd). But in a twist on ""The Lion King"" dads rival (Alec Baldwin) insists that Alex perform a belated fertility ritual. It ends badly when Alex cops some moves from ""West Side Story"" and the whole family is banished from the preserve. There are several other subplots involving a drought; a romantic triangle between Melman Gloria and a hunky hippo (will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas); and a tough old lady from Brooklyn (Elisa Gabrielli) who frustrates the penguins efforts to get the plane airborne again. The best moments arguably belong to Sacha Baron Cohen who is allowed time to camp it up mercilessly as King Julien the Lemur. Personally Id wait for the DVD and use ""Madagascar Escape 2 Africa"" as an electronic baby sitter. But do what you have to do. MADAGASCAR ESCAPE 2 AFRICA Second verse same as the first. Running time 88 minutes. Rated PG (mild crude humor). At the Empire the Union Square the Lincoln Square IMAX others.

Madagascar Escape 2 Africa (R) DreamWorks/Paramount (89 min.) Directed by Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath. With the voices of Ben Stiller Chris Rock Jada Pinkett Smith David Schwimmer. Opens Friday at theaters in New Jersey. TWO STARS They like to milk it milk it. They like to milk it milk it. They like to milk it milk it. Yes three years after four animals escaped from the Central Park Zoo and landed on a remote island -- and their movie minted a cool half-a-billion dollars -- the ""Madagascar"" menagerie is back. And their new adventures are unfortunately not much more inventive than the old Reel 2 Real song they boogied to the first time around. After a flashback intro that sets up some plot complications to come -- and a quick recap of the last movie -- the cartoon sequel picks up pretty much where the first left off. Strapped into a barely functioning plane (piloted by some overly confident penguins) our zoo crew is finally headed back to their urban lives in New York. Except their plane almost immediately crashes in Africa. Quickly separating the four friends depart on separate adventures. Melman the giraffe takes up medicine; Gloria the hippo finds romance; Marty the zebra discovers hes not as alone (or unique) as he thought; and Alex the lion discovers his roots and his long-lost family. This is all workable enough but after the original film -- where all the four really had to do was figure out how to survive -- it feels a little scattered. Add in a number of supporting characters and subplots -- including those penguins the lemur ruler of Madagascar and an enemy scheming to depose Alexs lion-king dad -- and you quickly lose the thread. It doesnt help either that most of the humor is tired at best. The battling granny from the first film -- a one-joke wonder there -- gets several unnecessary scenes here. And picturing Melmans jungle practitioner as a ""witch doctor"" with a bone through his nose feels more than a little politically incorrect even for a talking giraffe. The original cast is all back with Ben Stiller as Alex Chris Rock as Marty Jada Pinkett Smith as Gloria David Schwimmer as Melman and Sacha Baron Cohen doing a spot-on Peter-Sellers-in-""The-Party"" accent as the king of the lemurs. Even better are Alec Baldwin as the duplicitous lion and will.i.am clearly channeling Barry White as Glorias basso-profundo love interest. Like every DreamWorks cartoon its painstakingly animated (right down to heat waves rising from the ground) and full of intricate camera movements. Yet the only real laughs come courtesy of the penguins (all voiced by members of the crew). Whenever we move away from their scenes -- sharp and quickly edited -- the film slows a bit. Whenever we skip to one of the main characters learning yet another life lesson the fun begins to fade. The penguin ""Skipper"" is definitely a hoot particularly for any parent old enough to remember Robert Stack and ""The Untouchables."" Alec Baldwin continues to bloviate amusingly and will.i.am is pretty wonderful as the hip hippo. But the two 10-year-old boys next to me seemed fairly unmoved even with all the Sprite and Sour Patch Kids coursing through their veins. And the theater itself seemed far too quiet. Except of course for when the on-screen gang reprised ""I Like to Move It."" Again. Rating note The film contains mildly crude humor.

"Madagascar Escape 2 Africa | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; madagascar-escape-2-africa ) Madagascar Escape 2 Africa (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli One reason to lament the existence of Madagascar Escape 2 Africa (which will hereafter be referred to merely as Madagascar 2) is too bemoan the considerable amount of talent that was tied up developing this uninspired sequel when it could have been employed in the service of something fresh and new. As a product - a flashy and shiny bauble lighting up the screen featuring familiar faces and voices and offering a brief diversion from the real world - Madagascar 2 accomplishes what it sets out to do. The bar isnt that high but the picture clears it. This movie reminds me of the forgettable Disney animated movies from the immediate pre- Little Mermaid era creative sinkholes brought to the screen exclusively to provide parents and children with an opportunity to bond over something thats not frightfully bad. If Madagascar 2 is the best Dreamworks can provide to go toe-to-toe with Pixars beautiful WALLE then its game set and match to the Disney subsidiary. The IMAX version of Madagascar 2 is being sold as the best way to see the film and its no wonder. Whatever faults this movie may have it is a visual feast and a definite step-up from the disappointing look of its predecessor. With full vibrant colors and richly detailed backgrounds Madagascar 2 has as much ""pop"" as any recent digitally animated production. The bigger the screen the more likely one is to become immersed in the experience and not care as much about the myriad weaknesses that keep Madagascar 2 grounded. If only the movie had a story to match the craft of its animators. The problem with the film lies with the writers (who are also the co-directors). Instead of doing something interesting with the leftovers from the first Madagascar they elected to play it safe and perform a do-over. And at least for adults safe can be boring. Kids will be delighted by the cute wisecracking animals and vivid hues. Adults can sleep through half the movie and not miss anything. Returning are our animal cracker heroes from the first film Alex the dancing lion (voice of Ben Stiller) Marty the acid-tongued zebra (Chris Rock) Melman the dour giraffe (David Schwimmer) and Gloria the happy hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith). When the makeshift plane theyre using to return to their Central Park Zoo home goes down not long after takeoff they find themselves stranded in Africa. This unexpected detour reunites Alex with his father Zuba (the late Bernie Mac); puts a strain on lovelorn Melmans pining for Gloria; and introduces Marty to hundreds who look and talk just like him. Eventually its up to the quartet of newcomers to head upstream into the unprotected wilderness beyond the animal preserve and determine why the life-giving river providing water has dried up. Its not much of a plot but that shouldnt be a surprise. Madagascar 2 isnt about story so its combination of elements from The Lion King Finding Nemo and Joe Versus the Volcano represents the maximum narrative density one could reasonably expect from this movie. For Madagascar 2 to work you have to really like the characters. And while the vocal work of Chris Rock and Jada Pinkett Smith is outstanding Ben Stiller and David Schwimmer are dull and anonymous. The anonymity isnt a problem - many of Disneys classic animated characters were voiced by unknowns - but the lifelessness is. The soundtrack features ""More than a Feeling"" by Boston and ""Copacabana"" by Barry Manilow as well as playful snippets of ""The Good the Bad and the Ugly"" ""Born Free"" and ""New York New York."" So theres music but this isnt a return to the Disney-style animated musicals of the 90s. The humor is for the most part geared toward children with the occasional double-entendre designed to go over the heads of younger viewers. As was the case with the first film the penguins get all the best lines. One suspects the film would have been more entertaining had it concentrated on them just as the Ice Age movies would work better if they focused on the misadventures of the sabertooth squirrel. Its hard for me to generate much enthusiasm for or against Madagascar 2. It is what it is and it will absorb entertainment-thirsty families the way a parched sponge sucks up water. Its an adequate way to spend 90 minutes with the family and seen from that perspective it achieves its aims. However this is not the kind of animated movie that provides a rich fulfilling experience for solo adult viewer. As such it is more properly labeled a ""childrens movie"" than a ""family film."" And like many such films that target less discriminating viewers its as forgettable as it is disposable.

Like father like son Alex the lion (left BEN STILLER) and his father alpha lion Zuba (right BERNIE MAC) share a family resemblance and an astounding moment in DreamWorks? ?Madagascar Escape 2 Africa.? Photo DreamWorks Animation L.L.C. Movie review Madagascar Escape 2 Africa 1 / 1 Back to Gallery MadagascarEscape 2 Africa Animated comedy. Starring the voices of Ben Stiller Chris Rock David Schwimmer and Jada Pinkett Smith. Directed by Tom McGrath and Eric Darnell. (PG. 89 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) More often than not sequels to kids movies are atrocious. Many dont even pretend to have artistic ambitions focusing instead on their inevitable Happy Meal toy giveaway at McDonalds. For every ""Toy Story 2"" expect to endure 10 pieces of garbage such as ""Garfield A Tail of Two Kitties"" and ""Superbabies Baby Geniuses 2"" in the name of love for your child. ""Madagascar Escape 2 Africa"" is a nice surprise surpassing the quality of the first film. The story is scattered trying to wedge six or seven different narratives into a movie thats less than an hour and a half long. But thankfully animated comedy is a genre where good joke-writing can compensate for plot deficiencies. The animation is sharp and whenever things start to get confusing a penguin or lemur comes onscreen and does something really funny. ""Madagascar 2"" begins where the last one left off with the lion giraffe zebra and hippo from ""Madagascar"" leaving the titular country and heading back to their homes at the New York Zoo. These first 10 minutes of the movie are genius with the mercenary-for-hire penguins from the first film piloting a restored plane that crashed into the jungle decades earlier. One character reads an old Life magazine with Joe DiMaggio on the cover trying to ignore the skeletons scattered throughout the cockpit and the engine thats smoking outside the window. The group detours to Africa where Alex the Lion (voiced by Ben Stiller) runs into his father Zuba (the late Bernie Mac). From there the story splinters into several directions - some boring and some inspired. Alexs father issues and the romantic subplot between the hippo and the giraffe are tired. Chris Rock has more fun voicing Marty the zebra and any scenes with penguins or Julien the lemur (Sacha Baron Cohen) are bound to generate a few laughs even though the Julien-related volcano sacrifice subplot doesnt quite work. Much of the humor in ""Madagascar 2"" is broad but the script avoids flatulence jokes and broad slapstick adding a sophisticated level of parody in several scenes. A subplot involving New Yorkers who get trapped in Africa goes in unexpected directions which are mostly very amusing. Some monkeys show up to help build a new plane and spend the majority of their time negotiating on behalf of their union. The film makes an extra effort to keep adults interested which means pay attention to the PG rating if youre bringing younger ones. Screenwriter Etan Cohen who also wrote ""Tropic Thunder"" makes ""Madagascar 2"" about 20 percent more twisted than your typical animated family film. (My 3 1/2-year-old sat through the whole thing and hasnt tried to throw his brother in a volcano for what thats worth.) ""Madagascar 2"" was made by DreamWorks Animation which is catching up with Pixar when it comes to visual splendor. Nothing late in the film surpasses the excitement of the plane crash sequence but the scenes with multiple herds of animals are impressive especially if you catch one of the IMAX screenings. -- Advisory This film is responsible for some mildly crude humor cartoon violence and an especially annoying Happy Meal toy zebra that screams ""Holla at your boy"" and ""This place is crazy"" over and over until your ears start to bleed.

A prototypical summer release dropped into early November this furiously raunchy occasionally bright and eventually benumbing comedy stars Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott as buddies forced to become mentors in a crackpot version of a Big Brother program run by a not-so-former crack addict. (At one point in its development the film was called ""Mentors"" but the marketing people may have worried that the target audience wouldnt know what mentors do.) The programs director is played by Jane Lynch who was memorably funny as Steve Carells libidinous boss in ""The 40 Year Old Virgin."" Like everyone else in this cast she has been directed by David Wain to sell an attitude -- the gleeful cynicism of a hustler who cant be hustled. Like everyone else she ends up wearing out her welcome by overselling her wares. But then the target audience isnt shopping for understatement. ENLARGE From left to right Christopher Mintz-Plasse Paul Rudd Seann William Scott and Bobbe J. Thompson in a scene from ""Role Models."" Associated Press What it gets at the outset is glib flip and quick -- qualities to be admired in the genre and especially in a movie with a relatively short running time of 99 minutes. Danny played by Paul Rudd (another graduate of ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"") and Wheeler played by Seann William Scott (the manic Stifler of the ""American Pie"" films) work as sales reps for a supercharged energy drink called Minotaur. When they overindulge in their product and wreck their company truck their next stop is court-ordered participation in Sturdy Wings the smarmy institution of lower relearning where Wheeler a foulmouthed party animal is assigned to mentor a robotically foulmouthed fifth-grader named Ronnie (Bobbe J. Thompson) while Danny a stickler for language pairs off with Augie a 16-year-old refugee from reality whos obsessed with his role in a flesh-and-blood fantasy variant of Dungeons amp; Dragons. (Hes played unsubtly by Christopher Mintz-Plasse who was the delightfully nerdy Fogell in ""Superbad."") Holiday Movie Preview The buddydom is initially done deftly Mr. Rudd gives Danny an intriguing air of detachment that turns to despair after hes dumped by his gorgeous lawyer girlfriend. (Shes played by still another ""Virgin"" graduate Elizabeth Banks.) But something bizarre starts to happen around the halfway mark perhaps because no one knew how to develop the original premise. The fantasy game a wildly overproduced outdoor free-for-all takes over the film. Some of it is amusing -- the games aesthetic borrows liberally from the rock band Kiss -- but as those 99 minutes threatened to become a mini-eternity I found myself wondering why I was watching a screwy kid doing battle with a fey king and his medieval chain-mailed knights. But then Im not the target audience. ENLARGE Alex the lion (the voice of Ben Stiller) Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer) and Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) in ""Madagascar Escape 2 Africa."" DreamWorks Watch a scene from the upcoming animated film ""Madagascar Escape 2 Africa."" Video courtesy of Paramount Pictures. (Nov. 6) Madagascar Escape 2 Africa ""Madagascar Escape 2 Africa"" continues the saga of the plucky animals who in the 2005 animation hit escaped from the Central Park Zoo and landed in the island nation of Madagascar. This time attempting to return to New York aboard a rickety airplane piloted by penguins they survive a crash landing in Africa. At first they mistake their ancestral cradle for San Diego or possibly New Jersey but theres no mistaking the new film for Pixar. We are once again deep in DreamWorks territory where story and characters serve mainly as pretexts for clever riffs on familiar pop-cultural themes and a visual style that soars beyond prettiness into sustained radiance. ""Its like Roots "" says Marty the zebra as the African adventure unfolds. The roots are shallow but the sequel is good-natured high-spirited and perfectly enjoyable if you take it for what it is. Its less a product of inspiration than accretion. Grown-ups with a memory for movies will tick off the sources and references ""The Flight of the Phoenix"" in which an aircraft was built from salvaged pieces (an apt metaphor for the film as a whole); ""Gladiator"" or the world of professional wrestling as the model for a rite of leonine passage endured by Alex the uncertain lion hero voiced by Ben Stiller. Little kids will be stirred by Alexs reunion with his parents; by his desperate efforts to gain their approval; by the love of Melman the giraffe for Gloria the hippo; and by Sacha Baron Cohens virtuoso performance as once again the voice of Julien the lemur. Juliens colloquy with the gods of a volcano is only the product of his perfervid imagination but its inspired as distinct from accreted. The Boy in the Striped Pajamas ENLARGE Childs Play Jack Scanlon (left) and Asa Butterfield in ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas."" Miramax Films Watch a scene from the film ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas."" Video courtesy of Miramax Films. (Nov. 6) ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" was directed by Mark Herman who adapted the script from a novel by John Boyne. The film succeeds to the degree that it does -- partially but honorably and sometimes affectingly -- because it was made as well as it was. (The cinematographer was Benoit Delhomme.) The central character Bruno (Asa Butterfield) is the eight-year-old son of a Nazi officer in World War II. When the father becomes commandant of a concentration camp the family moves from Berlin to a rather stylish house with Bauhaus lines on the edge of the camp. Soon Brunos explorations lead him to the camps barbed-wire perimeter which he takes to be the fence of some sort of farm where the farmers and their children choose to wear for some odd reason striped pajamas. Then one of those children Shmuel the boy of the title who is played by Jack Scanlon edges close to his side of the fence and becomes Brunos friend. Brunos misunderstanding is a given that you will either reject as cloyingly false naivete or accept as a device for retelling the Holocaust story from a new perspective. Though I wavered between the two I came down more often than not on the side of acceptance at least at the outset; the movie has strengths that often outweigh the contrivance. The main strength is Asa Butterfields fine performance as Bruno. Another is the language spoken by an excellent cast that includes David Thewlis as Brunos father and Vera Farmiga as his mother. The entire movie is in English but matter-of-fact almost prosaic English that paradoxically confers a convincing dailiness on the familys life and on Brunos slow realization of what his father -- and by extension the Nazis -- are doing in the camp. That said the development of Brunos friendship with Shmuel pushes plausibility to the breaking point. For one thing the Jewish boy looks more like a victim of indigestion than malnutrition his ashen face notwithstanding. For another the plot contrivances -- including a betrayal evocative of ""The Kite Runner"" -- cross the line into naked manipulation. When Bruno makes an effort to set things right the film goes powerfully wrong. Find TV listings at LocateTV. DVD Tip ENLARGE Universal/Everett Collection Weve seen lots of Elizabeth Banks lately and thats a good thing even if her recent films -- ""W."" and ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" -- havent deserved her. She deserved to have more screen time in ""Seabiscuit"" (2003) but she made the most of her minor role Marcela Howard (right) the second wife of the horses owner whos played by Jeff Bridges.

"Madagascar sequel packed with genuine laughs | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsMadagascar sequel packed with genuine laughsThe animated comedy Madagascar Escape 2 Africa succeeds where the original failed with enlivened characters and a fine sense of the absurd writes Peter Howell.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Nov. 7 2008 Madagascar Escape 2 Africa (out of 4)Animated comedy featuring the voices of Ben Stiller Chris Rock David Schwimmer Jada Pinkett Smithand Sacha Baron Cohen. Directed by Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath. 89 minutes. At major theatres. G The law of the jungle in filmmaking is that if you dont get it right the first time then no amount of monkeying will make a second attempt swing.Madagascar Escape 2 Africa makes a fool of that rule. It has everything Madagascar had three years ago but also two things the original was woefully lacking a good yarn and genuine yuks.The animated laugher about zoo critters on the lam was by no means a failure as a 500-million-plus global box office would attest.But the humour was flatter than elephant dung and the film served more as a babysitter than anything approaching classic comedy.Wonder of wonders somebody was listening to the critics. Perhaps it was co-directors and co-writers Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath who this time share scripting duties with Etan Cohen who has Tropic Thunder and episodes of TVs King of the Hill to his considerable credit.Whatever it is theyve managed to enliven the characters - animal magnetism perhaps? - and expand the story while adding a fine sense of the absurd.On that last point would you believe a little old lady Noo Yawker named Nana (Elisa Gabrielli) who uses her martial arts skills to mess with the menagerie? Madagascar 2 picks up exactly where the first film left off. Alex the lion (Ben Stiller) Marty the zebra (Chris Rock) Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer) and Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) seek to return to their dens in New Yorks Central Park Zoo after some accidental and unauthorized adventures on the island nation of Madagascar. In a nod to Flight of the Phoenix one of many film and TV references in the franchise they plan to fly home using a crashed plane that their pesky penguin pals have cobbled together. Things dont go as planned - huge surprise there - and the zoo crew instead find themselves on the continent of Africa a place brotha Marty correctly calls ""our ancestral crib"" yet which is completely foreign to them.Heres where the smarter writing pays off. The first film never got past the tired fish-out-of-water premise and the jokes were staler than a forgotten box of animal crackers. Madagascar 2 actually gives a new twist to the old trope these animals are back where they came from - Alex even finds his parents - and yet they dont feel like they belong. Its up to these pampered New York plush toys to learn to adapt or die.Standing in their way is the aforementioned psycho senior and a jealous lion named Makunga who wants to be alpha male of Alexs family pride. But theres also love on the loose.Stepping up to centre stage is King Julien the loony lemur voiced by Sacha Baron Cohen whose role has been considerably and profitably expanded as befits a comic who made a small film called Borat since the first Madagascar.But those wacky penguins led by the headstrong Skipper (writer/director McGrath) still steal every scene theyre in.The movie even looks better than the original approaching photo-realism in its jungle imagery. For better or worse the music is every bit as corny as before ""Born Free"" is still the theme tune and Barry Manilow and Boston is on the penguins eight-track player - but what do you expect from those bird brains?The highest praise I can give Madagascar 2 is to say that it reminds me of the antics of another animal the one called Monty Python. Suddenly the prospect of a Madagascar 3 seems not only inevitable but actually worth roaring about.

What animated flick doesnt have furry characters spouting off in voices that sound suspiciously familiar? Its that so many of the critters populating ""Madagascar Escape 2 Africa"" crack wonderfully wise and talk fast. Their riffs will be music to their target demo of PG-ers. Their not-at-all snide asides should please the rest.  RATING | Animated Comedy Emotionally and visually richer than its 2005 original ""Escape 2 Africa"" opens with a lion cub and his alpha male dad playing in the tall grasses of Africa. Big-eyed and possessed of a certain joie de vivre Alex is cuteness personified. Father Zuba voiced by the dearly departed Bernie Mac is a mix of tough but mostly tender love. Their time together is interrupted by Makunga a smarmy rival (Alec Baldwin) who believes he should lead the pride. Then a more dangerous and unexpected intruder separates Alex and Zuba forever. Or what might have been forever if not for the misadventure of the original film which landed grown-up Alex (Ben Stiller) and friends Marty Melman and Gloria in Madagascar and misadventure No. 2. On a penguin-manned jet headed for New York they make it all the way from the lemur- overrun island nation near the southeast coast of Africa to well mainland Africa. If youre thinking ""hakuna matata"" youre not far off. There is something very familiar in Alex who becomes Alexs back story and that of a certain cub named Simba. (Jeffrey Katzenberg oversaw ""Madagascar"" and Disneys insta-classic ""The Lion King."") But directed once again by the tag team of Tom McGrath and Eric Darnell (a University of Colorado alum) ""Madagascar"" comes with its own pleasures and lessons about how you can go home again if only to discover your roots. Much of the chattering comedy is delivered by Skipper the gruff penguin in charge and lemur King Julien who boards the doomed plane at the last minute with sidekick Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer) in tow. Sacha Baron Cohen builds on the hilariously arrogant ruler. Co-director McGrath mines his inner penguin even more this time out. A scene about a labor dispute between Skipper and the chimp workforce fixing the plane is the sort of stuff that may soar over the booster-seat crowd but touches down perfectly on a tarmac of adult silliness. Theres plenty of adult- tweaked but not winking jokes. The eye-candy for kids is as substantial as the hippo rumps that are when you see em shaking kinda funny. For their part the quartet of zoo-raised protagonists provides homilies about kith and kin community and the place of the individual as well as life-long friendship and interspecies dating. Writers McGrath Darnell and Etan Cohen spread the story around without bloating the run time. Alexs issues with his dads pride -- in both senses of the word -- are just one of the throughlines in ""Escape."" Hypochondriacal and lovesick Melman (David Schwimmer) becomes the doctor of his fellow giraffes. He also becomes jealous when Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith) turns the enormous head of a fine speciman of a hippo named Moto Moto (will.i.am who also co-wrote the music with Hans Zimmer). Handling bad guys in family fare can be tricky. Baldwin does a good job of making Makungas menacing gestures the traits of a flawed not entirely evil personality. And the filmmakers have found a cranky-funny antagonist for our heroes in a little old lady not from Pasadena but from Noo Yawk. Along with others stranded during an African safari adventure she must fend for herself. So fend she does reminding us how enterprising troublesome and interconnected we humans are with the wild and mild kingdom. Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedy denverpost.com.

"Escape 2 Africa loses its way - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review Madagascar Escape 2 Africa Escape 2 Africa loses its way David Schwimmer Jada Pinkett Smith Ben Stiller and Chris Rock respectively provide the voices of Melman the giraffe Gloria the hippo Alex the lion and Marty the zebra. (Paramount Pictures) By Janice Page Globe Correspondent / November 7 2008 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + We all like to ""move it move it."" Maybe thats why ""Madagascar Escape 2 Africa"" is such a disappointment.Given the popularity of the originals signature song - a hypnotic irresistible Sacha Baron Cohen cover of Reel 2 Reals 1990s hit ""I Like to Move It"" - a successful sequel should have been as easy as re-cueing the track cranking out a few inspired lines and filling in the pretty colors.Those DreamWorks animators do have a way with pretty colors.Unfortunately just about everything else in ""Escape 2 Africa"" fails to drum up much excitement and that goes double for the cartoon-hippo seduction scenes. If you own a TV you will have heard the best laughs excerpted in unrelenting commercials leading up to the movies release. The rest is pleasant sometimes even amusing but its no more must-see than nap time at the zoo.The sequel begins as a prequel. In Africa a cuddly lion cub wanders outside the safe confines of his home reserve falls in and out of the hands of hunters floats across the sea in a crate and winds up performing for audiences in Manhattans Central Park Zoo where he is named Alex and voiced by Ben Stiller. Suddenly were back to where 2005s ""Madagascar"" began with the popular dancing lion befriended by Marty the wisecrack-a-lackin zebra (Chris Rock) Melman the neurotic giraffe (David Schwimmer) and Gloria the sassy hippopotamus (Jada Pinkett Smith).In a dizzying setup sequence that is sure to befuddle newcomers the animals replay bits of their 2005 journey to Madagascar in the company of penguins and chimps. Then the whole menagerie attempts to fly a salvaged plane back to New York but crash-lands in Africa instead.This should be where the adventure opens up like the plains of the Serengeti. Visually the film certainly impresses with its sweeping landscapes. But its story is a flat forgettable retread Reunited with his family (insert reference to ""Roots"") Alex must thwart a scheming alpha lion (Alec Baldwin) earn the respect of his father (the late Bernie Mac) and rediscover his place in the world along with his friends. Not even Cohens kooky lemur king can rescue that tired plot.""Madagascar Escape 2 Africa"" is directed by Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath the same pair that helmed the original. This time Darnell and McGrath share screenplay credit with Etan Cohen (""Tropic Thunder"" co-writer; no relation to Sacha). They introduce a few new characters (rapper will.i.am is the deep voice of a hippo with the hots for Gloria) and they find ridiculous uses for some old ones (Nana the feisty New Yorker who shows up as a handbag-wielding tourist on safari). It doesnt much matter whether or not they hit their marks. ""Madagascar 3"" is reportedly already in the works.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Madagascar Escape 2 Africa"" is an 89-minute Happy Meal of a movie. Its bright and simple handsomely designed and enjoyable enough for children I guess but entirely without interest to grownups. Where ""Bee Movie"" and ""Kung Fu Panda"" included jokes and ideas designed to reward repeated viewings this mediocre sequel to the 2005 DreamWorks Animation hit doesnt offer much to engage minds that have moved beyond coloring books. For the record the story gives us a group of neurotic New York Zoo animals stranded on the titular island just off Africas coast. The theatrically inclined lion Alex (voiced by Ben Stiller) smack-talking zebra Marty (Chris Rock) fretful giraffe Melman (David Schwimmer) and curvaceous hippo Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith) are itching to return to safe secure life behind bars in Manhattan. Their fellow refugee penguins are flightless but theyre still birds so they repair a decrepit airplane to carry everyone home. With loony lemur King Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen) and his henchman Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer) also on board they make it as far as the mainland before crash landing. In the savannah Alex meets his parents (the late Bernie Mac and Sherri Shepherd) for the first time since poachers snatched him as a toddler. Alec Baldwin plays a conniving lion who aims to replace Mac as the leader of the pride while Black Eyed Peas singer will.i.am voices a basso profundo hippo love interest for Gloria sending her shy suitor Melman into the dumps. If youre suffering from character overload at this point theres good reason. The films more-the-merrier construction overstuffs the story with subplots. And we havent even mentioned the human hunters and New York tourists who swell the scripts population. Theres a great deal going on none of it too absorbing or consequential. A walk in the park a trip to the museum or an afternoon of checkers would serve most kids (and all adults) much better.

ABOUT THE MOVIEMadagascar Escape 2 Africa 1/2 (out of four)Voices Ben Stiller Chris Rock Jada Pinkett-Smith David Schwimmer Sacha Baron Cohen Bernie Mac Alec BaldwinDirectors Eric Darnell and Tom McGrathDistributor DreamWorksRating PG for some mild crude humorRunning time 1 hour 39 minutesOpens Friday nationwide WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY More animals dont necessarily translate to more fun and laughter at least not when it comes to animated sequels. Madagascar Escape 2 Africa features the same lovable quartet of zoo animals out of their element plus their canny penguin pals brainy chimps and clever lemurs. But it adds dozens more creatures into the mix and moves the action to the African plains. Unfortunately things also feel less original. At times the story and the setting along with a few key characters seem intended to conjure up Lion King associations. INTERVIEW What Jada Pinkett Smith says about animals kids love The main characters former denizens of Central Park Zoo are still lost and at odds in their new habitat. This time around Alex the lion (Ben Stiller) Marty the zebra (Chris Rock) Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer) and Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) hop on a plane constructed by the wily penguins joined by King Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen) and his associate/cousin Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer). The first flight of Air Penguin inadvertently lands in Africa instead of returning to New York. Here the four main animals encounter their wild counterparts and experience culture shock as they meet legions of their own species. There are a few cute moments featuring Marty and his lookalike fellow zebras and the neurotic Melman discussing the illness patterns of giraffes. Alex is touchingly reunited with his mother and father. Gloria lives large entertaining the attentions of hot-to-trot hippo Moto Moto (will.i.am) who seems to be channeling Barry White. Cohens lemur king is funnier than in the first film and his eccentric personality better developed. The least interesting and most caricatured roles are human particularly Nana a tough granny from Brooklyn who had a small part in the first film. Shes back on safari again wielding her handbag as a loaded weapon. Alec Baldwin plays the malevolent Makunga whose manipulative character bears a strong resemblance to Lion Kings conniving Scar. The late Bernie Mac (who stars in Soul Men also out this week) plays Zuba Alexs stern father. While the cast of characters has grown the story still focuses on the value of friendship. The plot expands to include familial and romantic love and to celebrate diversity and uniqueness. Though it doesnt add anything new to the genre Madagascar 2 is amusing animated fare. And with few current movies aimed at very young audiences this menagerie offers more potential for humor and visual panache than say a movie about Chihuahuas.

Joe Neumaier Thursday November 6 2008 206 PM The simplicity of the original ""Madagascar"" - New York zoo animals out of their element in gasp the wild - was easy for kids to get and New Yorky enough for adults to appreciate so the original 2005 adventure made almost - gasp - 200 million. The followup ""Madagascar Escape 2 Africa"" dilutes the idea some by giving every four-legged hero a story arc. And theres not enough of the first movies super-erudite monkeys. Yet the sitcom-style silliness is still there and its nice to see that the old ""grin or frown as you wave a hand across your face"" joke still has cross-generational and cross-species appeal. RELATED JADA PINKETT SMITH ROARS ABOUT ""MADAGASCAR"" ROLE It begins with a flashback to the grasslands youth of Alex the lion (Ben Stiller) whos lured away from his father (Bernie Mac) by animal-preserve workers. But the captured Alexs box falls into the ocean and washes up in New York where he grows up to become the showboating star at the Central Park Zoo. After a recap of the previous movie Alex smart-aleck zebra Marty (Chris Rock) calm hippo Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith) and nervous giraffe Melman (David Schwimmer) have built a ""Flight of the Phoenix""-style plane and plan to catapult themselves back to Manhattan along with their flight team of thuggish penguins the prancing lemur King Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen) and haughty chimps Phil and Mason. Crash-landing in Africa the team meets Alexs parents on a waterless preserve and everyone finds a purpose. Nice as it all sounds theres still plenty of slapstick and harshness including an extended role for Nana the little old lady from the first movie who leads a team of stranded New Yorkers fighting for survival after the penguins take their truck. (The penguins are again scene-stealers so much so that theyre headed for their own TV series soon.) Alex of course emerges as the movies real New Yorker abroad. Hes supposed to be as beloved as the 42nd St. librarys stone lions and though the ""Lion King""-tweaking plot has him facing down a villainous pretender to his dads throne named Makunga (a funny Alec Baldwin) he and his pals use their city-slicker smarts - or in Melmans case neuroses - to stand apart from the pack. Savvy little sidewalk scrappers ought to appreciate that along with the timeless appeal of watching a lion do silly dances. Theyll probably take the gorgeous computer animation for granted but parents will discover its really great to look at. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Retread it with The Lion King storyline. Pump it up with air.Now you have Madagascar Escape 2 Africa an overinflated sequel to the one about the lion the zebra the giraffe and the hippo liberated from the Central Park Zoo and deposited (by penguin commandos) on the island nation off the east coast of Africa.As in the first installment of the DreamWorks animation M2 suggests that to flourish in the jungle it helps to have street smarts. Never mind that the film subtitled Escape 2 Africa doesnt technically leave the continent although this time it moves from the worlds fourth-largest isle to the mainland.With its stylized menagerie resembling plush creatures on a Toys R Us shelf M2 surely will appeal to undemanding viewers age 6 and younger.Yet unlike Pixar films this busy and noisy film has too-generic a story and too-undistinguished a look to offer much for those kids older siblings and their parents.Although they were best friends at the zoo in Africa M2s main characters stick to their own kind. Alex the lion (voice of Ben Stiller) hooks up with his family; Marty the zebra (Chris Rock) with his herd; Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) with another of her species; and Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer) with his hypochondria. Given their four competing storylines none of the these chatty central characters really emerges.Which means M2 like its predecessor is literally hijacked by the penguin commandos (very funny) and metaphorically by the vocal caperings of Sacha Baron Cohen on hand again as Julien mischief king of the lemurs.Among the morals this multiculti affair purveysReal lions do dance.Interspecies love is cool.All zebras dont look alike.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

The animated tale of animals that escaped from the New York Zoo continues the journey they started in the first film and all the central characters return - Alex the lion (voice of Ben Stiller) Marty the zebra (Chris Rock) Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer). This time around with the help of the evil penguins and a ramshackle husk of an airplane they escape Madagascar where theyve been stranded and crash-land in the wilds of Africa where Alex will get in touch with his roots. And although there are some inspired bits - making the hypochondriac Melman a doctor is one of them - too often the movie takes what worked well in small doses in the original and beats them to death in the sequel. Thats almost literally true of Nana (Elisa Gabrielli) the old woman with the dangerous pocketbook we met the first time around when she was beating Alex to a pulp in the train station. It was funny then because it didnt last long. Here shes a major character crucial to much of what transpires which might have been OK if she were more likable. Its quite the coincidence that she would show up thousands of miles away eh? Too bad. The same is true of Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen) the self-involved lemur king. He was hilarious in the first movie the best thing about it a sort of twisted take on King Louie in The Jungle Book. But again that was in a smaller role. Here he suffers doubly - hes stretched thin in a larger role and theyve taken his song away from him. Now the four friends sing I Like to Move It adopting Juliens signature tune for themselves. In the wild everyone must come to terms with his or her lot. Alex meets his parents and must prove that he is worthy of them. Marty surrounded by a million identical zebras faces an identity crisis. Gloria wants love and happiness and Melman must come to terms both with his hypochondria and his feelings for Gloria. Its a lot to crowd into 89 minutes. Too much really. Alexs bit seems particularly underdeveloped. But there still is a nice feeling of camaraderie and real friendship among the central characters and its that friendship that serves them best in the end. That will doubtless be true in the inevitable third installment as well. Just leave Nana at home. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

"Movie review Madagascar Escape 2 Africa -- 3 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Madagascar Escape 2 Africa -- 3 out of 5 stars Alex Marty Melman Gloria King Julien Maurice and the penguins and the chimps find themselves marooned on Madagascar. But they do get to Africa where the members of the zoo-raised crew encounter species of their own kind for the very first time. It seems like a great place but is it better than their Central Park home? Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Madagascar Escape 2 Africa is more an encore than a sequel. Did you or your kids like the commando penguins Alex the ""jazz hands"" lion Sacha Baron Cohens impersonation of Peter Sellers the big-eyed mouse lemur the cranky little old lady who yells ""BAD kitty"" or the ""Move It Move It"" song?They all take curtain calls here. The movie borrows almost as heavily from The Lion King as it does 2005s Madagascar. The intrepid can-do penguins repair a plane to take themselves the four Central Park Zoo critters -- Alex the lion (the voice of Ben Stiller) Gloria the hippo ( Jada Pinkett Smith) Melman the hypochondriac giraffe ( David Schwimmer) and Marty the Born Free zebra ( Chris Rock) -- and the leading lemurs King Julien and Maurice (Sacha Baron Cohen and Cedric the Entertainer) ""home"" to New York. Amazingly they get as far as the African mainland.Thats where they all belong (except for the penguins and the lemurs) especially Alex whom we see in a flashback plucked from his pride by a poacher when Alex was but a cub. Now Alex is reunited with his dad ( Bernie Mac). Too bad the kid is so inept at being a ""real"" lion that he cant keep an evil lion with Alec Baldwins voice (and mane) from seizing power. Alex is a little too ""Fosse and Jerome Robbins.""Marty discovers that the thing that made him unique isnt all that special when hes surrounded by a herd of identical (same voice too) zebras.Gloria feels the need to mate and tumbles for the first hippo to drop a compliment her way.And Melman with his years of experience around vets may be qualified to be a witch doctor someone who can keep a sick giraffe from heading off to his ""dying hole."" The penguins enlist primates in their quest to build an aircraft.""Who says penguins cant fly?""In a needless complication human tourists are also stranded in their corner of Africa too.The big crisis The water hole has gone dry. Will the streetwise New Yorkers have the answer or will every animal on the savanna turn to King Juliens silly ""volcano god"" sacrifice superstition? Its a teachable moment thats squandered to make room for the next gag.The animation shows glossy improvement from the original Madagascar with nature and the neo-natural animals even more detailed than ever. But the knock on Dreamworks animation style -- that its entirely too talky -- rings true here.Escape 2 Africa has many an obvious direction to go in and many an obvious joke to make. Which it does. Will kids still giggle over Cohen the penguins and the big-bottomed hippo? Why not? They did the last time.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr B Madagascar Escape 2 Africa Genre Animation; Starring Chris Rock Ben Stiller Jada Pinkett Smith David Schwimmer; Director Eric Darnell Tom McGrath; Release Date Wide 11/07/2008; Runtime (in minutes) 89; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Dreamworks Distribution L.L.C. Posted November 5 2008 -- 1200 AM EST Something feels strangely familiar about Alex the lion in Madagascar Escape 2 Africa and its not just because we moviegoing humans met that animated animal voiced by Ben Stiller just three years ago in the original Madagascar. No whats striking about the cat this time around as he and his zoo buddies attempt to make their way back from Madagascar to hometown New York City (and crash-land in Africa instead) is how much Alex has in common with Stillers Tugg Speedman in Tropic Thunder. In his own charmingly egocentric way Alex -- raised in a zoo and ""performing?""as a lion surrounded by the real thing at an African water hole -- is the four-legged equivalent of Tugg the showboating actor ""performing"" as a soldier in the Asian jungle. In both instances Stiller excels at exploring the sillier aspects of self-involvement and its pleasant indeed to see Alex reunited with motormouthed Marty the zebra (Chris Rock) pessimistic Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer) and big-and-beautiful Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith). In the brightly drawn sequel as technically smooth as weve come to expect from the DreamWorks cartoon factory all four use their time in Africa -- the land of their ancestors -- as an opportunity for personal growth only to wind up more or less the way they always were. What you were expecting a cutting-edge twist maybe something about a lonely postapocalyptic robot? Wrong part of the animated kingdom my friends. Madagascar Escape 2 Africa is pretty tame but it knows how to keep its own turf tidy.

Wednesday November 5 2008 at 4 a.m. By Robert Wilonsky 1 A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The five-year-old didnt laugh as much as his 40-year-old father which granted isnt the basis upon which to conclude too much. Then again most of the adults at a Saturday-morning sneak preview of Madagascar Escape 2 Africa were clearly having a better time than the wee ones which should be expected from a film proffering Charles Darwin wisecracks class-warfare one-liners smoky backroom union brokering (including a monkey subbing a spark plug for a lit cigarette) and Alec Baldwin reprising his every last dick-boss role as an alpha lion with a shellacked gray-streaked mane. The kid adored all heck out of the first movie which like its subversive sequel featured the voices of Ben Stiller Jada Pinkett Smith David Schwimmer and Chris Rock; he didnt have much to say about the second one save for his fondness for the gag about the crashing plane and the penguins the latter of whom emerged as the acting-out favorites among the pre-K crowd. Alas a sad note as Stillers Alex is reunited with his parents in Africa--the dads played by Bernie Mac whose performance ranks among his richest. On a happier note Sacha Baron Cohens King Julien has an expanded role while Rocks zebra who isnt as special as he thinks provides a kids movie with a thoughtful moral about fitting in and standing out. Funniest movie of 08? Close enough for those who dont mind monkeying around.

""Madagascar Escape 2 Africa"" is the rare animated sequel that reps a notable improvement on its predecessor in every department. Lively and quite funny without being obnoxious this follow-up smoothly mixes the originals New York Zoo escapees with a number of engaging new characters they encounter upon crossing from Madagascar to the mother continent. With the first films creative team intact this DreamWorks Animation franchise has been well tended to meaning its reasonable to assume a repeat of the earlier outings 533 million worldwide haul (an unusually large percentage of which came from overseas). Picking up where the story left off back in 2005 the tale has the group of misfit Gothamites preparing for a desperate ""Flight of the Phoenix""-like journey back to New York in a makeshift flying machine to be launched by giant slingshot. As before there are twinkle-toed lion Alex (voiced by Ben Stiller) sassy zebra Marty (Chris Rock) neurotic giraffe Melman (David Schwimmer) and voluptuous hippo Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith) -- all anxious to get back to Manhattan haphazardly piloted by their fellow refugee penguins and accompanied by wacky lemur King Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen) and his flunky Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer). But after a crazy flight the plane makes it not to Central Park but to a glorious savannah populated by creatures such as the coddled protags have never seen before -- their own kind living in the wild. Not only that but Alex is quickly recognized as the long-missing son of the local prides chief Zuba (Bernie Mac). While the other animals mix with their own kind for the first time Alex treads into ""The Lion King"" territory with a rite of passage that will grant him full status only to be sabotaged by an evil pretender to the throne the vain Makunga (Alec Baldwin). Banished Alex eventually regroups with his buddies and courts danger by leaving the reserve to restore the dwindling water supply. The environmental message is agreeably soft-pedaled in favor of some truly mad antics involving King Juliens attempt to appease the water gods by presiding over a sacrifice into a volcano. In fact all moments of burgeoning sentimentality are short-circuited by irreverence and humorous one-upsmanship -- everything is fair game in often unpredictable ways. The first ""Madagascar"" grated due to the seldom restrained hysteria of the characters and an overall in-your-face aggressiveness that has periodically marred DreamWorks Animation fare. Here even as the comedy has been cranked up several notches the tone of the sequel has been smartly refined The slapstick is inventively bumptious rather than gross the innuendo suggestive instead of lewd the verbal sparring more clever than crude. This may have something to do with a new writing collaborator Etan Cohen for writer-directors Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath but the upgrade is noticeable. The four-leggeds have occasional run-ins with hunters and tourists and none among the latter is as mirth-inducing as a take-no-prisoners old granny (Elisa Gabrielli) who takes it upon herself to singlehandedly uphold the combative reputation of New Yorkers with some fearsome martial-arts turns. Among the other ace newcomers are Baldwins scheming Scar equivalent out to thwart Alex and a two-ton Lothario out to romance Gloria drolly endowed with basso profundo intonations by songmeister will.i.am who nicely handles scoring duties with Hans Zimmer. Spreading the comic wealth around are Cohen whose lemur monarch is now given sufficient screen time to emerge as memorably nutty; and the penguins especially boss Skipper (co-helmer McGrath) who takes charge in every situation and at one point is forced to compromise with monkey union negotiators over benefits. Another enhancement is the films look. Even for computer animation the colors are particularly rich with effort obviously expended to achieve magic-hour light on the African wilds. Team hired ace cinematographer Guillermo Navarro as a consultant which may account for the unusually pleasing compositions as well as some impressive moving camera shots. One small continuity error Paw birthmarks resembling the outline of the African continent and shared by Alex and his father are prominently featured in some scenes but are not present in others.
