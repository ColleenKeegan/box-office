Ironically it also unintentionally highlights just how personal Gibsons vision is. In defending his film writer-director-producer Gibson said his script came from the Gospels. Yet the Gospels dont always agree with one another -- and they certainly dont provide stage directions. Take John 1838 ""Pilate saith unto him What is truth?"" In Gibsons film Pilate speaks this line beseechingly; he wants to know. In ""John"" Pilate says it dismissively; he doesnt think it exists. Gibsons vision is violent vengeful. But as distasteful as I found it I almost prefer it to the bland matter-of-fact version of Jesus life we get in ""John."" ""John"" is what it says it is. The other Gospels arent dealt with here. There is no Sermon on the Mount no ""My God why hast thou forsaken me?"" Only what is in ""The Gospel According to St. John."" In fact everything that is in ""The Gospel According to St. John"" is in this film. Every line of dialogue. Every line of narration. Every trip Jesus and his disciples make from Judea to Galilee to Samaria. Movie review Showtimes  ""The Gospel of John"" with Henry Ian Cusick Stuart Bunce Richard Lintern Scott Handy narrated by Christopher Plummer. Directed by Philip Saville from a screenplay by John Goldsmith. 180 minutes. Rated PG-13 for violence involving the crucifixion. Meridian. The production values are low and the acting isnt great. The actor playing Jesus (Henry Ian Cusick) has a bit of a jaunty walk that seems out of place for the role. Its a straightforward unimaginative narrative and thus not very memorable. Its value -- and I believe theres always value in presenting what is after all the most influential story in the history of mankind -- lies in its particularity. In ""John"" Jesus teaches more by metaphor than parable as in the other Gospels. He speaks metaphorically (""I am the bread of life"") people misunderstand him problems result. This happens so often it gets tiresome but it does provide a kind of linguistic support for Christians the idea or object (man) that represents another (God). ""The Gospel of John"" is the first of many proposed films by Visual Bible International Inc.

Starring Henry Ian Cusick. Narrated by Christopher Plummer. Directed by Philip Saville. Written by John Goldsmith. (PG-13. 180 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Jesus Christ is having a big month even for a superstar. Hes the subject of two new movies Mel Gibson s controversial ""The Passion of the Christ"" and ""The Gospel of John"" Jesus story as told by his disciple John. Although it makes perfect sense for ""Gospel"" to be released near the beginning of Lent its not a bad guess that the filmmakers also hope to benefit from the heaps of publicity for Gibsons version. Hearing that ""Gospel"" is a three-hour word-for-word translation of the Good News Bible complete with narration sounds like an invitation to a nap. The movie however turns out to be surprisingly robust. It boasts a large cast not of Cecil B. DeMille proportions but big enough to show that Jesus got around. Christopher Plummer portentously narrates the dramas of this amazingly dramatic life as they are acted out. This sometimes puts a strain on the actors. When Mary cries out for her recently departed brother Lazarus Plummer intones that Jesus ""heart was touched and he was deeply moved."" Its left to Henry Ian Cusick as Jesus to look moved. Because its a literal translation theres a lot of repetition -- Jesus is reported by Plummer to have stood up straight twice in a matter of minutes. All of which proves that everyone needs an editor. But most of Jesus miracles are conveyed with conviction by director Philip Saville (""Oedipus the King"" and ""Metroland"") shooting in the desert and on the beaches of Spain. Just when it seems theres not enough fish and bread to feed a throng of thousands the baskets are magically replenished. Theres a simplicity to the scene of Jesus walking on water that makes it seem like a doable stroll. Jesus often has been portrayed as solemn a martyr-to-be. But Cusick plays him as joyous and positively beatific. He readily interprets Christs faith and enthusiasm with voice intonations reminiscent of Tony Blair. Interesting that a Canadian production would posit Jesus as an Englishman. (""Gospels"" principal producer is Garth Drabinsky who made his name backing lavish stage musicals but most recently has become known for a morass of financial and legal woes.) No attempt is made to glamorize the people of that time. Theyre shown with dirty faces soiled fingernails and rudimentary clothing (though you do have to wonder about their surprisingly modern-looking sandals). Coming in under the radar ""The Gospel of John"" is unlikely to incite people the way Gibsons movie has months before its release. But ""Gospel"" is not without its controversial moments. Similar to the ""The Da Vinci Code"" the film depicts a female disciple at the Last Supper. It also shows Pontius Pilate as reluctant to crucify Jesus and puts the blame on the Jewish people for insisting on it -- a scene that some may construe as anti-Semitic.

Drabinsky was enlisted as the movies primary creative producer by the Toronto-based Visual Bible International a ""publicly traded faith-based media company"" that plans an entire series of films based on the books of the Bible. The goal is to film all 66 of them -- of which The Gospel of John is the first. All this at a time when so much attention has been lavished on the controversies surrounding Mel Gibsons forthcoming (but without major-studio distribution) The Passion of Christ that many might reasonably wonder why another team has chosen to mount its own epic version of Christs life especially one in which the best-known star -- the films narrator Christopher Plummer -- never appears on screen. Beyond which the Gospel of John itself has long been stigmatized as the most anti-Semitic of the four Gospels containing in the original Greek some 67 occurrences of the word Ioudaioi which has customarily been translated into English as ""the Jews."" And Drabinsky himself is Jewish as are several of the films other producers. So it comes as little surprise that theres more than a tinge of weariness in Drabinskys voice during a recent phone interview. ""Its been a long tough 15 months"" he tells me. ""Its a very difficult picture to do and to do responsibly in terms of dealing with all of the areas of accountability. That was fundamental to me from the beginning. There was no point in doing it if we couldnt deal with all of the constituencies and make them happy in the process.""   Indeed no less a cultural gatekeeper than The New York Times seemed flummoxed by the very existence of The Gospel of John. In a September 29 dispatch from the papers Arts/Culture desk Daniel J. Watkin suggested that the movie had ""slipped in beneath the radar"" despite its having just world-premiered earlier that month as part of the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival generating an enthusiastic review by Todd McCarthy in Variety and leading the filmmakers to contemplate a wider release than the originally scheduled Bible Belt cities of the South and Midwest. The Gospel of John debuts this weekend in New York City and Los Angeles and though its arrival is hardly as unexpected as some earlier reports have suggested (the film has performed strongly in its limited heartland release) its success is by no means assured.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm While the last decade has witnessed an undeniable resurgence on television (Touched by an Angel) in literature (the Left Behind series) and in pop music (Lifehouse Creed Jars of Clay) of works conveying religious (or more specifically Christian) themes faith-based movies have experienced a somewhat tougher go of it. Despite a few successes -- 1999s The Omega Code reaped 12 million at the domestic box -- there has remained an undeniable schism between secular and non-secular movie culture with those films perceived as evangelical remaining the almost exclusive domain of independent production companies reliant on the financial contributions of wealthy benefactors. (Not helping matters has been the generally poor quality of the films themselves.) And though such films have begun to appear more frequently enjoying commercial engagements in mainstream cinemas they are largely self-distributed entities whose backers rent out theaters for upfront flat rates (an all-but-defunct process known as four-walling) and promote their titles via Christian Web sites and mailing lists. It is in effect a niche operation. To even that niche audience however The Gospel of John may seem an intimidating prospect. Three hours long and overseen not just by its director Philip Saville but by an entire advisory board of biblical scholars organized to ensure the films letter-perfect accuracy -- giving new meaning to the expression ""filmmaking by committee"" -- the movie sounds more like a rigorously academic Sunday-school exercise than it does a movie. Even Saville speaking by phone from London concedes that at first glance the film appears to be ""a tour de force of endurance."" ""Its demanding"" adds Saville ""to have to hear Jesus say Im telling you the truth so many times -- I think 16 or 17 times."" Yet appearances often are deceiving. Though I approached The Gospel of John with some trepidation Ive now seen the film twice and consider it to be an extraordinary achievement. Extraordinary for the way it casts its oft-told events in such a fresh light that they do not seem so familiar at all. Extraordinary for its simultaneously intimate and epic scale eschewing the decorous pageantry customary to the genre in favor of small-scale Vermeer-like scenes depicting the minutiae of everyday life at the dawn of recorded history. (Even the crucifixion scene is treated with a wholesale aversion to spectacle.) Extraordinary -- most of all -- for the way the very aesthetic limitations (the lengthy narration the fidelity to the text) that would seem to stultify the film instead imbue it with a mesmerizing intensity. Writing in his 1984 book The Epic Film which includes an entire chapter devoted to cinematic adaptations of the New Testament Derek Elley said that ""To date there is no treatment of the Gospels which manages . . . to humanize the biblical text yet retain its epic stature."" The Gospel of John is at long last that movie -- and its something more than that. Rather than the ethereal Christ figure common to much religious art The Gospel of Johns Jesus (played brilliantly by the Royal Shakespeare Companys Henry Ian Cusick) is a fundamentally human impassioned rabbi frustrated by the need to perform miracles as a way of proving himself enraged by the sin he sees all about him. By showing the character from ever-shifting points of view (belonging to both Jesus followers and his enemies) Saville allows an extraordinary sense of how Jesus might have appeared to various eyes as both prophet and deranged fanatic. And by adapting the Good News Bible Societys translation of the source text which substitutes ""the Jewish authorities"" for ""the Jews"" John Goldsmiths screenplay goes a long way toward diffusing the guilt-by-association implication of the entire Jewish people in Christs death. (Among the many important points it brings to the fore is that Jesus and his original followers were all themselves Jewish by birth.) But what makes The Gospel of John so different so much more accessible and ultimately so much more moving than many of the faith-based films and biblical epics that have preceded it is that it seeks not to preach nor to proselytize. Rather it aims simply to relate a great and enveloping story -- one that may lead us to ponder the things that unite (rather than distance) peoples of differing belief systems and may compel us to marvel at the many wonderful and horrible endeavors undertaken in the name of religion. Though it signifies something of a watershed moment in what might be called Americas New Religious Cinema Drabinsky himself is quick to point out the broader goals of the film. ""I guess you have to put it into that generic category"" he says ""but to me doing a film of a segment of the Bible is really filming a great piece of literature whether its religious or not. The words have relevance in a secular world as much as a religious world as far as Im concerned."" Whether The Gospel of John can win over moviegoers weaned on a diet of more secular cinematic fare remains to be seen. With the exception of Holocaust-set pictures and horror films that employ the Catholic Church as a background for demonology religion per se has largely ceased to exist in mainstream movies -- and its something even Drabinsky sees as a worrisome conundrum. ""When issues stop being debated discussed and analyzed from a religious perspective"" he says ""higher levels of intolerance are there.""

The makers of this ponderously middlebrow Canadian production have re-created the Gospel of John in its pristine entirety - word for word miracle for miracle. The trouble is their reverence doesnt come off as spiritually bold Its closer to the thudding prosaic literal-mindedness of the ""Harry Potter"" films. Henry Ian Cusick the British stage actor who plays Jesus resembles a sleeker version of the fiery young Dustin Hoffman and he has a captivating beatific presence. He makes goodness seem not pious but fearless - a blessed form of virility. Unfortunately the Gospel of John (not the movie the Biblical text) is less varied than most of the other Gospels. Its full of Christ giving lectures speechifying his mission and the result for the movies lacks a charge of discovery the Messiah as revelation rather than just a given. In the film Jesus declaims his heavenly status in every scene and you certainly believe it because hes the only figure on screen who approaches three dimensions. The director Philip Saville relies far too heavily on Christopher Plummers gaseous PBS-goes-to-church narration (theres only so much one can take of his stentorian assault on lines like ""He who comes from above is greater than all"") and the staging with its depopulated sets and very bad 60s lighting suggests a video supplement crafted for a Bible-study group. There is barely a whisper of the spirit the lifeblood the passion that has marked the cinemas most memorable explorations of Jesus life notably Scorseses ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" and Pasolinis ""The Gospel According to St. Matthew."" ""The Gospel of John"" is so cut-and-dried it makes faith look easy - or more to the point simple.
