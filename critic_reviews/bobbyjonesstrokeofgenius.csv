"Jones Indifferent Strokes washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Jones Indifferent Strokes Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 30 2004 CALL IT PAR for the course. Based on the life of one of golfs early 20th-century heroes ""Bobby Jones Stroke of Genius"" delivers nothing more and nothing less than one would expect from a boilerplate sports biography which is to say the standard triumph against a litany of standard obstacles. Each one arises predictably like a new hole -- a sickly childhood familial disapproval his own ferocious temper academic obligations health problems marital discord self-doubt a Mephistophelian arch-rival etc. etc. -- and each one is dispatched with the kind of undistinguished yet nevertheless respectable storytelling that one might expect from say a made-for-cable-television biopic. It isnt that ""Bobby Jones"" is especially bad. Its just not especially good either. Joness major claim to fame was winning four major tournaments (the U.S. Amateur U.S. Open the British Amateur and British Open) in a single year 1930 a feat that has yet to be equaled. And not only to his eternal glory did he do it all without ever turning pro -- ""Money"" one character wryly observes ""its going to ruin sports"" -- but he quit a year later in a kind of voluntary martyrdom. Jones so the movie tells us was a true amateur in the sense that he played for the love of the game and not fame or fortune. Why then you might wonder does he speak of feeling trapped by the sport? And why does playing make him so miserable leading to a nervous condition that affects his stomach and self-medication through cigarettes and alcohol? The reasons were complicated I have no doubt but director Rowdy Herrington (who co-wrote the script with Tony DePaul and Bill Pryor) doesnt help uncomplicate them. His story merely lays out the facts episodically relying on an accrual of peripheral detail -- a harrumphing grandfather (Dan Albright) a neglected wife (Claire Forlani) a debauched but talented rival (Jeremy Northam) an avuncular sports-writing mentor (Malcolm McDowell) -- to substitute for insight into the man. And Jim Caviezels portrayal of Jones while certainly adequate in most regards does little to shed any real light on the characters apparently tormented psyche. (I say ""apparently"" because were not given much to go on besides shaky hands and the occasional hurling of glassware.) ""Bobby Jones Stroke of Genius"" expects I think that viewers will read something mystical if not in Joness accomplishments then at least into the game of golf itself. Otherwise why cue the soundtracks heavenly strings ethereal wind chimes and martial bagpipes every time Jones tees off in slow motion with a long arcing drive? Bobby Jones was a great athlete Ill grant you that. But Caviezel with the shameless encouragement of Herrington seems to think that hes still playing Jesus Christ. BOBBY JONES STROKE OF GENIUS (PG 133 minutes) -- Contains mild obscenity and a thrown punch. Area theaters.

"Bobby Jones Reduced To Putters and Sputters washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Bobby Jones Reduced To Putters and Sputters Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 30 2004 Last time we looked Jim Caviezel was perched high on the hill in ""The Passion of the Christ."" But in ""Bobby Jones Stroke of Genius"" he has taken a fall -- directly into the sand trap. As Robert Tyre Jones Jr. the legendary amateur from Atlanta who in 1930 won the U.S. British and Amateur opens in golf a feat no one else has achieved Caviezels likable enough. But the story around him is so inert and formula-bound and the characters around him so subsidiary and one-dimensional hes functionally useless. Even if Caviezel had the gravitas to break through these shortcomings hed never look better than silly. Its the fake hairpiece. You can actually see the gum sticking to his head not to mention the artificial weave. It looks as if the great Bobby Jones is wearing blond roadkill. Directed and co-written by Rowdy Herrington ""Bobby Jones"" invests most of its overlong drama (more than two hours) in Joness mastering of his legendary temper. Even as a kid he cusses when he misses a shot. He throws his club into the air. His face flushes as if its going to explode. And it affects his game. The other problems fall into line behind his fieriness. Hes a sickly child from the get-go who must withstand various physical ailments even to make it to the links. He gets a lot of emotional support from his father (Brett Rice) and a local sportswriter (Malcolm McDowell) follows him to every game but Bobbys grandfather (Dan Albright) is an imposing individual who disdains sports. After Bobby gets married to Mary (Claire Forlani) and has children he realizes that she expects a lot of time and commitment. These relationships are so tedious to sit through -- no one seems even close to real -- you cant wait for the man to get out and play. The trouble is theres nothing particularly memorable about the sports coverage either. Seen one whack out of the rough seen em all. When different actors have to play the same character at different ages we usually try our hardest to suspend disbelief as one actor disappears and the next one takes over. But the three actors playing Jones (including Devon Gearhart and Thomas Lewis) dont seem to be the same person at all. Their only commonalities are 1) theyre blond and 2) they are sentient beings. As for James Horners irritatingly drippy score that is the wrong emotional driver to bring to any range. Golf enthusiasts are likely to enjoy watching Hairpiece Jones matching his super swing -- and legendary temper -- against the mighty likes of Walter Hagen (a swaggering chain-smoking Jeremy Northam) and Harry Vardon (Aidan Quinn). And there is also the gusty majesty of St. Andrews that hallowed ground in Scotland which also turns out to be his great white whale. But the pleasure is almost gratuitous; outside the drama. Even the staunchest of golfheads must know theyre watching a cut-and-trite accounting rather than a fanciful evocation. ""Bobby Jones"" is no ""Tin Cup."" Bobby Jones Stroke of Genius (133 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for mild obscenity.

BOBBY30 Jim Caviezel in ""Bobby Jones Stroke Of Genius."" When golfers were golfers and every ending was a happy ending 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Bobby Jones Stroke of Genius. Drama. Starring Jim Caviezel Claire Forlani Jeremy Northam and Malcolm McDowell. Directed by Rowdy Herrington. (PG. 126 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Bobby Jones Stroke of Genius"" begins where most movies in the sports genre finish -- with a crowd of fans cheering like maniacs as the overcome- with-emotion hero makes a determined march toward his field of play. Like ""Seabiscuit"" on uppers this earnest golfing biopic packs its happy endings in the beginning end and several places in the middle. Its too much feel-good movie to take in one sitting but ""Stroke of Genius"" captures just enough detail from the greatest sportsman youve never heard of to keep the historical drama interesting. Bobby Jones played by Jim Caviezel could hit the hell out of a golf ball even when he was a sickly little boy. The movie takes the obligatory trips through his early childhood and teens before settling on the golfers dominating career in the 1920s and 1930s -- where he turned down prize money and endorsement riches staying amateur to prove his love of the game. With no enemies and no real bad guys in ""Bobby Jones Stroke of Genius"" the conflict is between Bobby Jones and himself and the plot developments are often unconvincing. After watching Caviezel get flogged for two hours in ""The Passion of the Christ"" audiences may find it challenging to get worked up about his characters struggle with varicose veins. In many ways this is the movie version of the VH1 ""Behind the Music"" special featuring Huey Lewis and the News. Jones life is a series of repeated ups -- uninterrupted by drug abuse car crashes or a single incidence of adultery. ""Bobby Jones"" doesnt offer the thrilling ride of ""Miracle"" or ""Hoosiers "" but it is a mostly pleasant one. The movie has the handsome production values of a well-funded PBS series -- ""The Forsyte Saga"" comes to mind -- and never feels rushed. The only major visual distractions come when director Rowdy Herrington insists on Scorsese-style camera tricks to follow the ball through the air and along the putting green (somebodys been watching ""The Color of Money""). Caviezel doesnt emote enough to reveal the nature of the golfers inner demons but the real-life Jones family which approved the movie probably doesnt want us to know anyway. The rest of the actors pick up any slack with Jeremy Northam particularly good as the roguish rival Walter Hagen. Its also nice to see the great Malcolm McDowell in a movie that hasnt gone straight to video even if his sportswriter O.B. Keeler character follows Jones around for most of the film like the worlds most intellectual stalker. ""Money"" Keeler says in one of several statements of wisdom aimed at modern moviegoers. ""Its going to ruin sports."" Was Bobby Jones really this great a guy? Who knows? But after watching the greed that has consumed sports and the anti-heroes that have consumed modern films finding someone to clap for is an OK way to pass the time. -- Advisory This film contains a few profanities.

BOBBY JONES STROKE OF GENIUS Movie Review (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/bobby-jones-stroke-of-genius-2004,200,bobbyjonesstrokeofgenius9,bobbyjonesstrokeofgenius,rogerebert
"Bobby Jones captures leisurely pace of golf but lacks drive - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Bobby Jones captures leisurely pace of golf but lacks drive By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  April 30 2004 In the short history of golf movies ""Bobby Jones Stroke of Genius"" falls somewhere between the nostalgic hogwash of ""The Legend of Bagger Vance"" and the raffishness of ""Tin Cup."" (It doesnt pretend to scale the Olympian heights of ""Caddyshack."") This is an old-fashioned sports hagiography of the sort that Gary Cooper used to star in while Teresa Wright sat smiling and worried on the sidelines and amazingly it engages your attention and even respect while trotting out every clubhouse cliche in the book. Weekend golfers and older audiences will find it a refreshing dip in a bygone past; anyone who considers the game a tedious hobby for grown men to mythologize will be asleep by the second scene.Fair warning ""Bobby Jones"" is over two hours long and its subject like most sports gods isnt all that interesting when hes not doing that thing he do. The filmmakers strain to come up with dramatic conflict -- one onlooker actually sighs and says ""Varicose veins at his age"" during a hospital scene -- but aside from a bit of a temper trouble with stress management and the occasional sand trap Robert Tyre Jones Jr. (Jim Caviezel) seems to have kept out of the rough most of his life.He was the Tiger Woods of his day children -- a teen golf prodigy who came out of nowhere Georgia in the years leading up to World War I and who achieved the golden indomitability of a legend during the Roaring 20s. He stood for fair play losing a tournament by one stroke after he penalized himself for moving the ball. And he did what no player had done before or has done since won golfs Grand Slam by taking the four major tournaments in the same year. Then at 28 he retired.""Bobby Jones Stroke of Genius"" tells his life story one patient scene at a time from sickly childhood to adolescent fame and into the pantheon and its at its modest best when conveying the look and feel of its period the clothes the concerns the unhurried pace. It surrounds Bobby with a gallery of types some of whom play this sort of thing well. Claire Forlani gives weight to the thanklessly drab role of Joness wife Mary and Jeremy Northam motors off with the film as pro golfer Walter Hagen a genial rake whose handicap is ""drink and debauchery.""On the other side of the green are Malcolm McDowell clanging away at a tin-eared AmAHrican accent as sportswriter O.B. Keeler Aidan Quinn sounding like hes from some odd Eastern European country club as rival Harry Vardon and Brett Rice and Dan Albright as Joness estranged father and grandfather who eventually share a healing intergenerational hug that would have gotten them run out of 1930 Georgia on a rail.And then theres Caviezel last seen suffering for the sins of others in ""The Passion of the Christ"" and here serving a similar function for the Saturday-duffer crowd. The most interesting notion offered in ""Bobby Jones"" is that the legend won tournaments to please his father went to college for his mother became a lawyer for his grandfather and quit golf to make his wife happy. In other words he did nothing for himself besides swing the club and hit the ball. Gorgeously.But passive-aggressiveness doesnt make for an interesting hero and beyond a little hand trembling and one full-on nervous breakdown from which the movie turns its head in embarrassment Caviezel does nothing to draw us into the man. His Bobby is as opaque as his Jesus; an icon to be worshipped but never approached. I have yet to be convinced that this is technique rather than bad acting. In Caviezels favor a blond dye job this shoddy might slow down Daniel Day-Lewis himself.""Bobby Jones"" was directed by Rowdy Herrington who made a few energetic knucklehead classics in the late 80s -- ""Road House"" with Patrick Swayze as a bouncer with a Rhodes Scholarship and ""Jacks Back"" with James Spader as twin-brother serial killers. The new film suggests that A) Herrington has picked up a serious golf habit and B) his filmmaking batteries have not run completely dry. This critic has manfully resisted the game as his friends have picked it up over the years and yet I still was enraptured by the arc of a 12-foot putt in this film or the way a man could loft a ball into a cup that wasnt even in his line of sight. Herrington gets the harmony of the moment; he knows all the rest is noise. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.Bobby Jones Stroke of Genius1/2 (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

Beyond obvious audience of golf fanatics this long-winded but classy drama could appeal to infrequent regional moviegoers. Jim Caviezel segues from whips and nails to a more benign nine iron in ""Bobby Jones Stroke of Genius"" a glossily packaged biopic of the golf legend who remains the only winner of all four major tournaments in a single year. Beyond the obvious audience of golf fanatics this exceedingly long-winded but classy drama could appeal to the same strain of infrequent regional moviegoers looking for righteous entertainment that flocked to ""The Passion of the Christ."" As such pic may serve as a litmus test to see what impact if any the biblical behemoth will have on its lead actors drawing power. A departure for writer-director Rowdy Herrington from his usual testosterone-fueled thrillers the reverential but somewhat stolid portrait clearly was fashioned around the inspirational model of ""Chariots of Fire."" Laborious pacing and an overload of detail in the poorly structured script cloud the films ability to get to the core of its subject and the key events that shaped his private and professional life. But while its somewhat bloated and intermittently dull at two hours-plus the polished visual treatment and Caviezels sober performance lift this above the standard network movie-of-the-week level that might otherwise have been its natural domain. Displaying a fascination for golf from a very young age Jones (Caviezel) overcomes a hot temper that lands him in trouble with sporting associations as well as his own rigorous moral standards and a tendency to succumb to nervous strain depression and physical stress during tournaments to become an American sporting hero. Before retiring to practice law and devote himself to his wife Mary (Claire Forlani) and family Jones drives himself to win the U.S. Amateur U.S. Open British Amateur and British Open within a four-month period a Grand Slam record still unbroken. Only after those wins was Jones diagnosed with the spinal disorder syringomyelia. Jones is portrayed as a selfless man of outstanding moral fiber integrity and focus achieving many of his goals primarily to give satisfaction to others He earned two degrees for his mother (Connie Ray) became a lawyer for his grandfather (Dan Albright) and a champion for his father (Brett Rice) and then withdrew from golf for his wife who was unable to endure watching him suffer. The film touches on the pollution of sport by money and sponsorship concerns something Jones steadfastly resisted. While the elements clearly are there in force for an uplifting story melding triumph of the human spirit with love of the game the script by Herrington Tony DePaul and Bill Pryor takes a frustrating approach. Too much time is spent dawdling over Bobbys childhood and teen years and in repetitive coverage of tournament after tournament without really distilling the essence of the man until the closing act summation. Providing solid support for Caviezels quietly intense central character Forlani registers as a warm sympathetic presence and Malcolm McDowell brings some spark to his role as poetry-quoting sports reporter O.B. Keeler who discovers Bobby as a youngster and sticks with him through his career. Jeremy Northam also figures strongly as Walter Hagen Bobbys chief golfing rival and his polar opposite as charismatic and self-aggrandizing as his opponent is subdued and serious. The balance of competition and mutual esteem between the two men is as central to the film as the relationship between Bobby and Mary is. Tom Sterns elegant widescreen lensing and crisp lighting the attractive southern U.S. and Scottish locations handsome period costumes and production design and James Horners gently stirring score all add to the films air of quality. For the record Jones Hagen and Keeler all were previously portrayed in Robert Redfords ""The Legend of Bagger Vance"" which like ""Stroke of Genius"" showed that golf is by no means the most dynamic of sports for dramatic treatment.

In this bucolic biopic gentlemen stroll from one sunstruck fairway to the next clad in knickers bow ties Scottish caps and jackets woven into the finest patterns of argyle and herringbone. The golf courses are emerald but the dominant color is beige - the beige of an older WASPier calmer America. As one of those Aaron Copland knockoff scores soars and swells optimistic as the morning dew Bobby Jones (Jim Caviezel) the greatest golfer of his era pulls back his club and swings sending the ball onto an arcing journey of such precision and power that its arrival on the green is practically a form of predestination. The message is clear There were other great golfers but Bobby Jones won because he believed in something...higher. A drawling Georgia native Jones unlike his competitors never went pro. Such was his love of the game and ""Bobby Jones - Stroke of Genius"" is a leisurely celebration of the purity of his victory. Its an atmospherically appealing and crisply shot movie and yet like ""Seabiscuit"" which it is clearly out to emulate it never quite summons enough adversity to ballast true drama. Jim Caviezel wearing a flat shock of honey-blond hair with a grin that flickers on and off his vertically ascetic face looks at times nearly as tormented as he did in ""The Passion of the Christ."" He plays Jones as a saint of golf a man whose only sin is his perfectionistic tendency to throw five- irons and shout things like ""S--fire and damnation"" when he messes up a shot. Caviezel however never really convinced me of his sportsmans anger. Hes a curiously remote actor like Kevin Costner without the lazy-boy sexual charm. Jeremy Northam as Jones opposite number the happily mercenary and dissolute Walter Hagen has a spark of corruption early on so I was disappointed to watch their rivalry get gradually defanged. Its pleasing to see Jones triumph digging his way out of sand traps with miraculous wedge shots but ""Stroke of Genius"" is proof that when a movie is nothing but inspirational it can sink and disappear into a field of dreams.
