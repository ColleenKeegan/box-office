Nobody wants to be these Italians a pair of colorlessly attractive American singletons in Bostons North End who dont even claim Italian heritage. (Theyre set up on a blind date by two beefy matchmakers pals of the guy who are under the sitcom-mistaken impression that ethnicity matters to the other party.) Everybody Wants to Be Italians writer-director Jason Todd Ipson wants his imitation of a big fat Italian wedding He ladles on the character and plot-development cliches in his processed romantic comedy as thick as Ragu sauce out of a jar and the actors follow through with performances as synthetic as pizza made with Kraft cheese.

A box of cannoli long past its sell-by date ""Everybody Wants to Be Italian"" is a clumsy but inoffensive romantic comedy set in and around Bostons Little Italy. To his credit writer-director Jason Todd Ipson mostly avoids the shrill stereotyping of ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" instead applying a vague almost half-hearted Italian overlay to a typically quirky tale of two mopey souls who are both attractive and (go figure) unlucky in love. Slight Roadside Attractions release begins its limited run Sept. 5. Plucky young fishmonger Jake (Jay Jablonski) gets fixed up on a blind date with beautiful thirtysomething veterinarian Marisa (Cerina Vincent); neither is Italian though each thinks the other is. Pic mostly ignores this mistaken-ethnicity hook instead focusing on Jakes stalkerish determination to win back his ex (Marisa Petroro) never mind that shes married with kids now. Jablonski and Vincent have appealing moments but are often elbowed aside by John Kapelos and John Enos III as Jakes boisterously shticky buddies. Relentless accordion music adds grating ambience and the inevitable Italy-set coda looks none too authentic. Dead fish in Jakes market are by far the pics freshest elements. Everybody Wants to Be ItalianProductionA Roadside Attractions release of an Asgaard Entertainment presentation of a James Huntsman Jaime Burke production. Produced by Burke Huntsman. Directed written by Jason Todd Ipson.

Im sure the distributor would like nothing more than to emulate Nia Vardalos 2002 sleepers success emerging from nowhere to win audiences hearts and wallets. Good luck. Set in Boston and offering a male lead with the maturity and charm of a grade-school bully this slapdash love story revolves around Jake Bianski (Jay Jablonski) a young successful Beantown fishmonger who remains hopelessly smitten with the girlfriend who dumped him eight years previously. (Thats when she discovered him sleeping with her sister.) Never mind that Isabella (Marisa Petroro) has moved on - shes married with three kids even. Jake still comes around pitching woo offering flowers and insisting that theyre soulmates. Hes a stalker basically but writer/director Jason Todd Ipson (a straight-to-video horror veteran) wants us to like him anyway. Enter Marisa Costa (Cerina Vincent) a cute veterinarian looking for a man to love - and looking for a stray cat beneath a dumpster in the alley behind Jakes fish market. Neither Jake nor Marisa it turns out is Italian but thanks to the meddling and ministrations of Jakes two authentically Italian (-American) employees the couple check each other out at a North End clubs Italian singles night. Jake and Marisa click but his ongoing obsession with his old sweetheart threatens the new relationship and the fact that each has been deceiving the other about their ethnic origins doesnt help matters any either. With a cameo from Penny Marshall playing a neighborhood florist and Judith Scarpone as a wise old Italian (and Olympia Dukakis doppelganger) offering advice to Marisa the plot winds its way to the inevitable happy ending. John Kapelos and John Enos III ham it up as the testosterone- and tomato sauce-fueled fish sellers and Vincent projects an engaging vibe but not exactly star power as the animal doc with the ticking biological clock (her characters 33). Full of clunky humor battle-of-the-sexes musings and spicy accordion music Everybody Wants to Be Italian is relentless - but not necessarily relentless fun.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Everybody Wants to be Italian (R) Roadside Attractions (104 min.) Directed by Jason Todd Ipson. Stars Jay Jablonski Cerina Vincent. Opens Friday at theaters in New Jersey. ONE AND A HALF STARS Theyre the multiplex version of screensavers. On your computer theyre useless images of aquariums or flying toasters that take up your monitor until youre ready to sign on and work. In theaters theyre forgettable movies that hold the venue for a week or two until its time for the real feature to come in and make money. No one dreams of directing one but in todays 12-screen product-hungry world theyre essential. ""Everybody Wants to be Italian"" is sadly the latest. Constructed out of tired jokes vaguely familiar actors and a few forced and predictable situations its strictly a harmless place-filler -- taking up space on the marquee for a while before slinking off quietly to late-night cable and discount DVD. The story such as it is revolves around a lovelorn fish-store owner who still carries a scaly torch for the girlfriend who dumped him more than a decade ago. Determined to snap him out of it his two salt-of-the-earth workers insist on taking him to a local Italian singles night. The problem is that Jake isnt really Italian -- and neither is the girl he happens to meet there. And both decide to keep that fact a secret. This is of course senseless (theres no real reason why either wouldnt tell the truth by the second date) and pointless (it doesnt lead to any jokes or even real complications). Instead there are just a lot of tired gags about jealous husbands stuffy professors psycho-  analysis and fistfights. Worse theres no real reason for the title or the setting in Bostons North End. At least movies like ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" and ""Moonstruck"" did something with their ethnic subcultures; this movie reduces Italian-Americans to a bunch of excitable people who constantly threaten castration. Waitll they get a load of this movie. Jason Todd Ipsons direction is at best nonevident. Stars Jay Jablonski and Cerina Vincent practically break a sweat trying to wring some life out of their lines but the comedy is dead on arrival. And proof that contrary to Benjamin Franklins observation its not just fish and guests who stink after a few days. Screensavers like this develop an odor all their own. Ratings note The film contains strong language and alcohol abuse. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Hunky Jay Jablonski plays Jake a Polish-American fishmonger who meets Marisa (Cerina Vincent) an attractive Hispanic veterinarian he mistakenly thinks is Italian. Jake is in a funk. Eight years after his ex-girlfriend Isabella (Marisa Petroro) dumped him hes still trying to win her back . . . despite the fact that shes now married with three children. So the stereotypically Italian gang at the fish store (veteran Richard Libertini is the funniest) encourages him to date Marisa and to pretend hes a paisan. Marisa meanwhile is encouraged by neighbor (Judith Scarpone another old pro) in her own Italian masquerade. The film plays out pretty much exactly as you would expect - which wont bother some people one iota. Running time 105 minutes. Rated R (sex profanity). At the Empire the Union Square the 64th and Second others. Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next J.J.

At the Regal E-Walk Village 7 (130). PG-13 Language. A decidedly lightweight amusement the first comedy from documentary filmmaker Jessica Yu is the sort of movie that works best if you keep your expectations low. The primary problem is lead (and co-writer) Jimmy Tsai who doesnt give us much to like about his character Christopher (C-Dub) Wang. C-Dub wants to be in the NBA but is stuck teaching kids table tennis in his parents gym. The suburban Chinese-American perspective offers the opportunity for a few interesting observations and there are a couple of unexpected laughs. But if you really want to be a player you need to do better than that. - Elizabeth Weitzman EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE ITALIAN 1 star Romantic comedy about two thirtysomethings who cant quite connect. At the Regal Union Square AMC Empire UA 64th and Second Ave (145). R Sexuality. With a title like this shouldnt Jason Todd Ipsons comedy celebrate Italian culture? Instead it aggressively insults the heritage it pretends to admire. In Bostons North End immature Jake (Jay Jablonski) falls for veterinarian Marisa (Cerina Vincent). But in one of many odd choices he turns out to be such a jerk we cant possibly root for them to get together. As for that title neither character is Italian but each thinks the other is - a weak device designed purely to inspire a slew of stereotypes. The women are bossy and manipulative the guys are macho morons. Just how everybody wants to be portrayed on screen. - Elizabeth Weitzman THE POOL 2 stars Hoping for a better life a teen ingratiates himself with a man and his daughter in rural India. At Film Forum (130). Unrated. Director Chris Smith - known for his documentaries - has a made a quiet quirky well-observed fiction about aspiration and connection. In Goa India 18-year-old Venkatesh (Venkatesh Chavan) wants a better future and thinks it lies with the upper-class family who rent a pool house near the hotel where he works. Striving to be accepted into the newcomers lives he woos the daughter and becomes an apprentice gardener to the father who provides guidance and life lessons. Smith (""American Movie"") sees the poetry in everyday people and lets his rambling story find its own rhythm. - Joe Neumaier A SECRET3 starsHis familys past envelopes a Jewish boy in the years after World War II. With Mathieu Amalric Ludivine Sagnier. At the Paris and IFC Center (150). Unrated Sexuality intense images. In French with English subtitles. Beautifully acted and exquisitely photographed director Claude Millers superb drama from Philippe Grimberts autobiographical novel is awash with the ripples created by unlived lives. Born in the late 1940s young Francois (Mathieu Amalric) is on the periphery of his father Maximes world and senses a family life that existed before he was born. As a teen he learns the truth about his fathers first wife (a mesmerizing Ludivine Sagnier) and the brother he never knew he had a figure who haunts Francois as an adult. Reminiscent of ""Sophies Choice"" Millers film hopscotches like sense memory through eras and emotions. - Joe Neumaier MISTER FOE 1 star A mother-obsessed misfit battles his stepmother and his own demons. With Jamie Bell Clare Forlani. At the Angelika (135). R Sexuality language violence. Jamie Bell (""Billy Elliot"" ""Undertow"") gives a watchable performance in this self-conscious coming-of-age drama though the films overall effect is best described as David Lynch lite. Hallam Foe (Bell) is an antisocial Scottish 17-year-old who likes to spy on his family and neighbors especially the stepmother (Claire Forlani) he suspects killed his beloved beautiful mother. Kicked out of the house to get a job Hallam heads to Edinburgh where he falls for his new boss (Sophia Myles) who bears a spooky resemblance to his dead mom. Hallams voyeuristic tendencies ruin things however and push his violent streak home. Director David Mackenzie (""Young Adam"") gets credit for consistency of tone but unlike Hallam the movie doesnt compel audiences to keep watching. - Joe Neumaier Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.
