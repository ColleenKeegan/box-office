More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out?

Director Lasse Hallstroms and scribe Robert Nelson Jacobs adaptation of a sad failed American rediscovering himself seems to be playing the authors music but the team behind ""Chocolat"" only occasionally captures the storys essential tones of absurd tragedy and comedy. As ungainly as its central befuddled character ""The Shipping News"" never quite finds its own internal compass. Director Lasse Hallstroms and scribe Robert Nelson Jacobs adaptation of E. Annie Proulxs beloved novel of a sad failed American rediscovering himself in Newfoundland seems to be playing the authors music but like a string quartet that plays a half-beat off the team behind ""Chocolat"" only occasionally captures the storys essential tones of absurd tragedy and comedy. Certain alterations made to the books characters and situations designed to build suspense become artificial and are delivered without the kind of conviction that would justify the changes. Markedly well-cast with the glaring exception of Kevin Spacey as the tales unsure hero Quoyle Noreaster dramas deliberate pace -- making it feel more like Hallstroms European work than his Yank pics -- and characters who ever so gradually reveal themselves will be appreciated by a dedicated but far smaller aud than Miramax must be hoping for during its annual high holiday season. Though some have doubted during the eight long years it took for the story to go from page to screen that there was a movie in a novel so resolutely irreducible and stuffed with seeming asides that are actually essential to the story the movie is clearly the work of sincere artists faced with a hefty task. Too hefty it turns out but Hallstroms connection to the material is direct and unforced Quoyle a man forever uncomfortable in his own skin fits nicely alongside such past Hallstrom oddities as Gilbert Grape. It is rather Spacey who is in alien territory at least 150 pounds lighter than he should be for a character who should have rolls of fat and a huge chin and working much too hard to make up the difference in a sleepy dialect a mannered sad facial expression and accident-prone behavior. The actor does everything he can but seldom has apt casting seemed so crucial. Pic went through 11th-hour alterations between the print screened for critics in early December and the final release version. Six minutes have been excised while Spaceys added first-person voiceover narration now bookends the tale. Trimming is mostly within scenes and -- with one glaring exception -- doesnt intrude on the drama. But neither does it eliminate problems that are part and parcel of the films fabric. Script ties Quoyles problems to his abusive father Guy (John Dunsworth) who pushes his 12-year-old son into the water where he nearly drowns. A remarkably telling and haunting special effect shows young Quoyles face underwater slowly evolving into the 36-year-old adult still underwater only now robotically slaving away at the Poughkeepsie News. Things happen to Quoyle -- precisely what makes him a fascinating novel character but far more of a problem for a movie -- and suddenly the tarted-up and self-centered Petal (Cate Blanchett) happens to him splitting from a guy and getting into Quoyles car. Before he knows it Quoyles in love fathers a daughter Bunny and is housekeeping while Petal openly sleeps around. Blanchett is a burst of spirited fire whose departure after less than 10 minutes produces a dramatic vacuum the movie never fills. She is so fierce and all-consuming that the viewer never stops for a moment to wonder what Quoyle is doing with her or she with him. Things really go downhill however when Quoyles terminally ill parents leave a phone message announcing their joint suicide. Thats followed by Petals taking off with Bunny (played by triplets Alyssa Kaitlyn and Lauren Gainer) but dying in a car crash. Meanwhile Quoyles crusty Yankee aunt Agnis (Judi Dench) stops by with condolences for his dead parents. Agnis is on her way to their familys old haunts and needing to find a new life Quoyle and the rescued Bunny venture with her by ship to the rocky remoteness of Newfoundland and the town of Killick-Claw which lenser Oliver Stapleton using a desaturated palette views as an imposing daunting outpost. The Quoyle clan left here 50 years ago and its lonely house still stands but decrepit and barely livable. Quoyle quickly lands a reporting job for local weekly rag the Gammy Bird run by tough but fair publisher Jack Buggit (Scott Glenn) and overseen by insecure contentious editor Tert Card (Pete Postlethwaite). While Proulx applied irony to the fact that Quoyle has to report on all the things he abhors -- water car crashes pressures -- theyre mostly handled here with a less-than-effective dramatic solemnity. Still pics newsroom snaps with characters including Brit Beaufield Nutbeem (Rhys Ifans) and aging Billy Pretty (Gordon Pinsent). Wavey Prowse (Julianne Moore) walking along the road with her brain-damaged son Herry (Will McAllister) catches Quoyles eye but his first two encounters with her are buffeted with awkward gaffes. At the same time several other story elements are juggled all of them leaving Quoyle on the sidelines as a kind of spectator. Jacobs script latches onto one incident like a kind of narrative lifejacket since it gives Quoyle for once an active role. When he stumbles upon a Botterjacht a yacht built for Hitlers private use and owned by bitter marrieds Bayonet and Silver Melville (Larry Pine and Jeanetta Arnette) Quoyle turns it into a story that so impresses Jack that he gives the cub reporter his own boat column. Quoyle later bumps his boat into the beheaded body of what turns out to be Bayonet almost drowning himself in the process. This story-within-the-story provides the passive lumpen Quoyle with some direction; however the budding romance with Wavey is the one story strand harmed in the revised release version. A sweet moment on the shore between the pair where they fall into a revealingly sloppy kiss is now gone making subsequent comments by Moores Wavey fairly nonsensical. At the same time Moores natural warmth gives the movie a real pulse and the qualities of resiliency that inform the novel. By the time a storm hits Killick-Claw leading to the destruction of the Quoyle family house its hard not to reflect on Billys journalistic advice to Quoyle for finding ""the center of the story."" A center is what seems to elude the film at every juncture and even a closing narration as Quoyle claims that he believes ""a broken man can heal"" doesnt do enough to grasp the tales heart. As usual Hallstrom works in extremely felt sympathy with a host of fine actors. In what would seem to be a mans world its the women -- Moore Dench and especially Blanchett -- who deliver many of the movies richest and rawest moments from Moores gentle strains and Blanchetts roving animal streak to Denchs granite emotional boundaries which gently break down in a marvelously quiet scene with Spacey. Glenn Postelthwaite Ifans and Canadian icon Pinsent feel very much like ink-stained wretches keen to lifes absurdities and Pinsent brings the extra texture of an inbred ""Newfie"" crustiness. Unlike the play of the exaggerated Minnesota dialect of ""Fargo"" theres no attempt here to stress or overplay the provincial accent long the butt of Canadian jokes. Tech credits push for a more severe look than is the norm in mainstream American films with Hallstroms crew embracing what must have been unfriendly weather and natural elements for extra visual and aural realism. Christopher Youngs Irish-inflected score is in tune with pics serious mood. The Shipping NewsProductionA Miramax Films release and presentation of an Irwin Winkler production.

Starring Kevin Spacey. Directed by Lasse Hallstrom. (R. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Its hardly possible to overstate what a welcome change of pace ""The Shipping News"" is for admirers of Kevin Spacey. None of Spaceys trademark brash sarcasm by now exhausted in a succession of roles is in evidence here. Faith in the actor is restored. As Quoyle the main character in E. Annie Proulxs novel now transformed into a beautifully made film by Lasse Hallstrom Spacey must be passive interior and on the margin. Quoyle knocked about by life and ready to retire from it comes out of sleep like a swimmer struggling for oxygen. The question the movie poses is Will he wake up from the dead and rejoin the land of the living? Hallstrom signals whats to come with an introduction to the man that makes viewers sit up in their chairs as Quoyles face emerges superimposed over that of himself as a bewildered child. It is a magnificent image for his childhood has shaped his entire life in a film that will be defined by images -- cinematographer Oliver Stapleton should share star billing. ""The Shipping News"" is the story of a submerged life rising to the surface. Puffy-faced and hesitant Quoyle has always been zapped by other people. His father tossed him in the water to sink or swim his wife brought her pick-up lovers home and even tried to sell their daughter for adoption. It doesnt seem likely that he will come out of his shell in distant Newfoundland where he has retreated with his 9-year-old daughter to an isolated ""salt box"" house held down by guy wires. He takes a job writing the shipping news for the local paper. Cate Blanchett makes an unforgettable appearance as Petal Bear the woman he is trying to forget. She had overwhelmed Quoyle with her ferocious lovemaking even if she was just using him and he continued to be her doormat. The only disappointing thing about Blanchetts performance is that the character disappears from the story much too soon. Proulxs story is populated by whimsical characters with quirky names to say nothing of personalities. Boat skipper B. Beaufield Nutbeam (Rhys Ifans) for instance was headed for New York but missed it and ended up in Newfoundland. Such quirkiness could get old fast in the wrong hands. Fortunately as Hallstrom presents them these characters dont know they are quirky and it works. The forbidding landscape of Newfoundland provides Stapleton with opportunities he doesnt waste. His images include a row of townspeople dragging the two-story house on logs across the frozen ground and of an imposing rock that looks like a ship rising out of the mist. When Quoyle comes across a floating headless corpse and manages in his startled haste to sink his own rowboat the result is a stunningly put- together sequence. Pete Postlethwaite is the gruff newspaper editor who teaches Quoyle how to write about automobile accidents. ""They like to read about car wrecks in Newfoundland"" he explains dryly. When Quoyle turns in his first story the editor tells him ""Your spelling is fine."" Quoyle gets on-the-job training and learns how to see the world in terms of headlines ""Bumbling Dad Humiliated at Day Care."" The day care center is run by Wavey Prouse and Julianne Moore radiates amused intelligence in the role a widow who becomes Quoyles anchor in the cold windswept fishing village and teaches him to eat seal pie. Crinkly faced Scott Glenn who keeps getting crinklier is the newspaper owner and Bunny Quoyles little girl is played by triplets who seamlessly merge into the role. gt;gt; Contains explicit sex and violence.

"USATODAY.com - News flounders even with Spacey Dench Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 12/31/2001 - Updated 0904 AM ET News flounders even with Spacey Dench By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The Shipping News (out of four) Stars Kevin Spacey Judi Dench Julianne Moore Director Lasse Hallstrom Distributor Miramax Rating R for language sexuality and disturbing images The Shipping News moves at a glacial pace much like the icy land its set in. And even a top-notch cast cant warm up the atmosphere. Two-time Oscar winner Kevin Spacey stars in the tale based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by E. Annie Proulx of a broken man who finds redemption when he returns to Newfoundland the country of his ancestors and begins covering crime and shipping news for the local paper The Gammy Bird. Spaceys Quoyle is an introvert emotionally battered first by a vicious father and later by Petal his heartless wife (played by Cate Blanchett in long dark hair looking like a cross between Fran Drescher and Cher). Read more Video The Shipping News trailer Nudging the sad sack toward self-respect is the Oscar-winning Judi Dench as Quoyles aunt Agnis who persuades him to make a new life for himself and his 6-year-old daughter Bunny (portrayed by triplets Alyssa Kaitlyn and Lauren Gainer). Once he reaches Newfoundland Quoyle befriends Julianne Moores Wavy Prowse who runs a day-care center. It took many years (with several casts and directors dropping in and out) for the 1993 novel to make it to the screen largely because of the difficulty in adapting such a reflective moody story. In the book the reader gets to know Quoyle from his thoughts perhaps more than from his actions. And that kind of internal character development cannot exist in a movie. Quoyle on film is so inhibited as to seem nearly blank. He develops a stronger sense of self and his humorous side emerges as he spends more time in frigid Newfoundland. Or does he only seem more vibrant in contrast to the dreary quality of the landscape? So the audience is left to wonder and piece together the mans motivation. His unusually intuitive daughter at one point asks ""Why are you so scared Daddy?"" Alas we never learn exactly why. Director Lasse Hallstrom tries to help by incorporating narration for some of the books artfully crafted passages but it comes off stilted and strained. Another distraction comes in the Newfoundlander accents. Moores is so awkward with the dese dose and dats (these those and thats) that she can seem none too bright while Denchs more graceful take reflects a trace of the familys Irish ancestry. The remote Canadian island seems more alive than any character with its severe desolate beauty effectively captured by cinematographer Oliver Stapleton (who last teamed up with Hallstrom on The Cider House Rules) and its mysterious isolation highlighted by Christopher Youngs haunting score.

Based on Annie Proulxs Pulitzer Prize-winning novel and brought to the screen by director Lasse Hallstrom [""Chocolat"" (2000) and ""The Cider House Rules"" (1999)] this slow-moving -- and at times downright bleak -- film nevertheless features a number of excellent performances. Kevin Spacey stars as Quoyle (the Old English spelling for a coil of rope) a man who has misplaced his soul. Once again in whats becoming his specialty Spacey plays an ordinary man at a crossroad in his life. After a life of abuse from his father and later his wife Petal (Cate Blanchett) Quoyle finds himself at loose ends after his parents commit suicide and Petal is killed in a car accident while running off with another man. Quoyle is left with their young daughter Bunny (played by identical triplets Alyssa Kaitlyn and Lauren Gainer) and his dead-end job as a printer for a newspaper in a small town in upstate New York. In sweeps his long-lost aunt Agnis Hamm (Judi Dench). Shes actually there to steal her brothers ashes but ends up staying to help Quoyle and Bunny through their initial grief. Finally she persuades Quoyle to return with her to their ancestral home a small fishing village on the coast of Newfoundland.

For the third holiday season in a row director Lasse Hallstrom has brought to the screen an esteemed litrary property turning it into an earnest uplifting Oscar hopeful for Miramax Films. On the surface these movies - ""The Cider House Rules"" ""Chocolat"" and now The Shipping News - may look quite different but really all three utilize the same recipe. Take a big chewy ""important"" subject; meticulously half bake until the characters whatever their flavors emerge as a warm and fluffy community; gently milk for popularity and prestige; and voila - you have a blandly high-toned Christmas cookie otherwise known as the latest edition of Lasse amp; Harveys Holiday Art-House Special. Just be sure not to gag on your eggnog. Except that its not going to work this time. Both ""The Cider House Rules"" and ""Chocolat"" were well-cooked pabulum with their unassailable liberal views of respectively abortion rights (how bold) and the right to? uh eat chocolate and make love (how really bold). But ""The Shipping News"" adapted from Annie Proulxs Pulitzer Prize-winning novel is just a limp and sodden downer. Its set mostly in the damp cold gray-sweater climes of Newfoundland where a widower named Quoyle (Kevin Spacey) the saddest of sad sacks has arrived with his young daughter all so that he can redeem the sullen tragedy of his life by learning to be a vital human being instead of a glum stammering lump of self-loathing. For most of the movie though hes just a lump. Its not entirely clear what Spacey thought he was doing but his minimalist performance consists of not much more than standing around in a black wool cap looking fleshy and morose as if he were a schoolboy about to burst into tears. Quoyle as presented isnt a hero or even an antihero. Hes just a wallflower in search of a screenwriter. How can this nonentity be redeemed? ""The Shipping News"" throws him together with a fellow single parent (Julianne Moore) whos got a few haunted corners of her own. He also goes to work for the local newspaper a job that allows him to get in touch with the colorful reporter within even though were given zero evidence that he can write or even hold a conversation. Is it just me or does a novel like ""The Shipping News"" express nothing so much as a kind of free-floating depression? Quoyle led to Newfoundland by his long-lost aunt (Judi Dench) discovers the dirty dark secret of his family yet divorced from the gummy waywardness of Proulxs prose nothing in the movie makes much sense. A corpse discovered at sea an oil-company scandal - these plot points are introduced only to be thrown away moments later. The real point is that were all supposed to feel real good about Kevin Spacey finally coming out of his shell. Sorry He lost that shell a long time ago.
