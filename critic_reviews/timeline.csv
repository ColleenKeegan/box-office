Comments Timeline An archaeologist (Billy Connolly) is recruited by a vaguely sinister corporation to cross through a time portal to 14th-century France and after something goes amiss his son (Paul Walker) and his devoted students must track him down without disrupting the course of history. This big-budget adventure is based on a recent Michael Crichton thriller though its premise is too stale to instill the sense of wonder critical to great sci-fi. Director Richard Donner (Lethal Weapon) keeps the action pumping and production designer Dan Dorrance optimizes the movies Renaissance Faire cred with an impressive re-creation of a medieval castle in the Dordogne. With Frances OConnor and Gerard Butler. PG-13 116 min. By J.R. Jones Now Playing Sorry there are no upcoming showtimes for Timeline Reviews/comments Subscribe to this thread By Email Subscribing...

Story of archaeologists forced to go back in time to rescue a colleague is at times incoherent. Pics only salvation may be offshore markets. A correction was made to this review on Dec. 2 2003. Yet another case of making time travel a messy ordeal rather than a load of fun ""Timeline"" lacks the consistent tone pace and point of view for either a science fiction thriller or medieval war adventure. Story of archaeologists forced to go back in time to rescue a colleague director Richard Donners would-be epic -- based on Michael Crichtons novel -- is scattershot and at times incoherent. Toned-down violence for a PG-13 rating and extremely basic dialogue signal a bid for pre- and young teens but a callow Paul Walker wont be enough to draw them in at the malls and pics only salvation may be in timely travel to offshore markets and ancillary. Already well known in some circles as a troubled production (highlighted by re-editing so significant that Jerry Goldsmiths original score no longer fit and had to be replaced with a jack-hammer score by Brian Tyler) pic seems patched together right from the jumpy start when a victim of a sword-wielding knight suddenly appears in the middle of the American desert. Something is wrong with the corpse and International Technology Corp. founder Robert Doniger (David Thewlis) wants the whole thing covered up. Doniger is backing an archaeological dig in the Middle Age French ruins of Castlegard led by Professor Johnston (Billy Connolly). This jolly Scotsman with an unaccountably very American son Chris (Walker) whos not interested in archaeology has a gaggle of eager students and assistants such as Kate (Frances OConnor) and Andre (Gerard Butler). They are all too willing to poke around in dank tunnels. Chris has a crush on Kate but this takes second billing as Johnston suspicious that Donigers up to no good takes off for Donigers New Mexico headquarters. When the students find a note from Johnston pleading for help -- and written in 1357 -- they set off for New Mexico to find him. Exposition and scientific explanations are often shouted at full volume and in confusing group scenes but basically Doniger has developed a machine that can transport objects at the molecular level. Unexpectedly tests of the device have also sent things -- and people -- through time via a wormhole. To retrieve Johnston the students must risk using the machine themselves and do it all (for no articulated reason) in three hours. Pics actual ""ride"" through time is unspectacular -- it just looks like folks standing in a hall of mirrors and screaming while theyre hit with bright lights and bursts of wind. Scene does not convey the engrossing wormhole effect that was present in ""Contact."" And in addition to a premise and execution that lack credibility pic constantly flirts with unintentional Monty Pythonesque comedy while struggling to establish an intense mood of danger. Jeff Maguires and George Nolfis script rarely rises above the rhetorical level of ""We gotta go"" as the crew madly dashes about trying to find Johnston in the English-occupied Castlegard during the 14th century Hundred Years Wars. The fact that the medievalist tough guys -- and ladies -- dont immediately sense something odd about these early 21st century college students is one element that makes ""Timeline"" malfunction. Additionally Donner appears uninvolved at a point where he had the opportunity to make a Middle Ages war movie. Production designer Daniel T. Dorrance puts in the heavy lifting with a small city of actual -- and not virtual -- sets. Unfortunately this real setting isnt utilized for inspiration for the movie as a whole. The Doniger plotline with hints of the corrupt business-science syndrome thats long been a Crichton staple gets lost in the shuffle. Thewlis as a result looks ungrounded and his strange mid-Atlantic accent hardly helps. The ensemble barely operates beyond the vague identity as a group with only Butler managing some intriguing link between present and past. The clear trade-off for speeding up production of the film (Richard Marks is credited as editor with Debra L. Tennant handling additional editing) and not having a major star is a severe loss of aud involvement with the characters. Although fairly lavish on the surface the filmmaking package is a curiously dull affair. Along with bland compositions and battle staging in naturally stunning surroundings the usually top-line lenser Caleb Deschanel (aided on second unit by no less than Vilmos Zsigmond) creates images that appear in the screened print to be washed out and frequently over- or underexposed.

Consider this scene A group of archaeology students having swapped their jeans and Gore-Tex for medieval garb march solemnly into a laboratory containment chamber where they will be faxed (yes faxed; apparently FedEx wont do) back to the 14th century where they will rescue their beloved professor Johnston (Billy Connolly) who -- oops -- accidentally slid down a wormhole and is now trapped in some sort of feudal war in ancient France. And you thought tenure was the only thing academics needed to worry about. Anyway so there they are ready to go risking their lives and testing the limits of science and trying to look really really serious and some helpful person in the lab shouts out ""You all look great by the way"" Not to be outdone somebody else perhaps a dropout from the campus screenwriting program contributes to the general high-tech atmosphere by warning ""Everyone be careful"" More warnings are issued buttons are pressed and off they all go down the electronic rabbit-hole an experience that looks comparable to an automatic car wash. Movie review Showtimes and trailer  ""Timeline"" with Paul Walker Frances OConnor Gerard Butler Billy Connolly. Directed by Richard Donner from a screenplay by Jeff Maguire and George Nolfi based on the novel by Michael Crichton. 116 minutes. Rated PG-13 for intense battle sequences and brief language. Several theaters. Surely Michael Crichtons novel on which the film is based couldnt possibly be this silly; surely the idea of casting wild-eyed Scotsman Connolly and surfer dude Paul Walker as father and son must have been hatched on a dare; surely the reason poor Frances OConnor (as the token female on the excursion) keeps wildly swiveling her head around is because shes looking for rescue from this movie. ""Do we look like quantum wormhole specialists?"" she asks someone sternly and if I had a dime for every time somebodys asked me that question ... well Id buy a ticket to some other movie. Never mind the plot holes and the non sequiturs; ""Timeline"" is an accidental comedy trapped in sci-fi/action garb like those actors swathed in their medieval tunics stumbling and lurching along. The lab is full of Bill Gates-ish guys in button-down shirts and glasses yelling at each other like some Microsoft staff meeting gone horribly wrong; the medieval scenes seem stuffed full of extras from ""Braveheart."" Everyone in this movie heroically manages to refrain from giggling; pity I cant say the same.

(AP Photo/Philippe Bosse) (Left to right) Paul Walker as Chris Johnston and Frances OConnor as Kate Ericson in Paramount Pictures ""Timeline."" (AP Photo/Philippe Bosse) Photo PHILIPPE BOSSE Nice battle scenes cant rescue Timeline from clumsy casting 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Timeline Action adventure. Starring Paul Walker Billy Connolly David Thewlis Frances OConnor. Directed by Richard Donner. (PG-13. 116 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Some actors like Jude Law have classical looks that transcend time and place. Paul Walker (""2 Fast 2 Furious"") tanned highlighted and very white of teeth is not one of those actors. Walkers screen presence evokes a very specific time place and even parentage 1996 Orange County and dad is a Saturn dealer. The camera loves him but his involvement in the time-travel movie ""Timeline"" requires a leap of imagination not easily achieved. Not just for segments taking place in the 14th century but in modern-day scenes where hes supposed to be the son of a very accomplished -- and very Scottish -- archaeologist played by Billy Connolly. His casting is only part of whats wrong with this clunky adventure story based on the Michael Crichton book. The direction by Richard Donner (""Lethal Weapon"") is usually a beat or two off and the dialogue seems clumsily ad- libbed. Theres lots of ""lets go"" ""yeah lets do"" ""cmon"" space-filling that leaves talents like David Thewlis and Frances OConnor looking slightly dazed as if they just want to get through the darned thing. ""Timeline"" is salvaged though by some compelling medieval battle scenes. Anyone interested in history will find the setup promising Connolly and his team of young archaeologists are investigating the site of a feudal French village that held off a British attack. But then things get convoluted. When Connollys character goes missing into the past his son and colleagues cant just zap themselves back to the 14th century in the same spot. They have to fly to the New Mexico offices of a nefarious corporation funding the dig and go through a time machine. What Thewlis sluggishly evil scientist fails to tell them is that their molecular structure will be altered by the transaction. You can go back to medieval France kids but your spine might not line up when you get back. This plot point by the way is never resolved in the film. When they get back to the village in France its on the very day the English attack and the battle scenes that follow bring the movie to life. Arrows doused with fire fly through the night sky and cannon blasts wallop the enemy. Special effects are nowhere in evidence -- even the hand-to-hand combat seems brutally real. The battle scenes provide the kind of guts-and- glory thrills that turn people into medieval re-enactment buffs. Of course love must bloom to fill gaps in the story and the most compelling romance happens between a modern archaeologist (Gerard Butler from ""Tomb Raider The Cradle of Life"") and a 14th century French noblewoman (Anna Friel). The actors overcome the silly dialogue in a scene where their characters flirt while floating down a river to elude the English. Butlers craggy virility would appeal to a fair maiden of any century. The matchup of Walker and Aussie actress OConnor (""Mansfield Park"") doesnt wash as well. Playing an archaeologist wary of involving herself with the boss son OConnor simply has too much gravity for Walker. Its like pairing Frankie Avalon with Patricia Neal.

"The medieval nonsense of Timeline. Slate Sign In Sign Up The medieval nonsense of Timeline. The medieval nonsense of Timeline. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 24 2003 601 PM Amateur Knight Richard Donner gets medieval in Timeline. By Bryan Curtis OConnor and Walker fall into a hole Most of Richard Donners Timeline (Paramount) takes place in 1357 but this isnt a movie of hoary Sherwood Forest cliches. It manages through sheer artistic force to stoop below cliche--to seem both fresh and rotten at once. Take this scene French invaders storm a British castle leap over the burning moat and arrive at the strongholds thick wooden doors. Halt At this point a conventional swashbuckler would have unveiled a battering ram the most durable of movie props. But in Donners telling the French knights regroup then begin to rap lightly on the doors like vacuum salesmen. Well I thought thats different. At this rate the Hundred Years War will be wrapping up sometime during the Mitterrand administration. We are here in Frances Dordogne Valley in the 14th century because a group of archaeology students have stepped into a time machine and hit the ""Send"" button; they are here because their beloved professor (Billy Connolly) disappeared into the same machine the previous day. This bit of high concept is brought to you by Michael Crichton whose novel the movie is based on. Crichton is often accused by his critics of shoving a film treatment between hard covers and calling it a novel. That seems a bit unfair if only because the film versions of Crichtons novels usually turn out to be such dreadful bores. Aside from Steven Spielbergs slick uneven Jurassic Park (1993) his books have inspired mostly dreck including the ludicrous Congo(1995) in which human actors gamboled in ape suits. The Timeline novel seemed to hold promise with Crichtons blend of pseudoscience and swift sketching of character. Advertisement But in the movie version its all too swift. Sifting through some monastery ruins in the present day the students find a note in the professors handwriting inscribed ""Help Me 4/2/1357."" Instead of mistaking it for the lyrics of a lost Beach Boys song they immediately deduce that the professor has fallen into a wormhole; then its off to New Mexico to find the company that owns the worlds only time machine. Theres little time for introductions but you gather hints here and there One student is a Frenchman; one is a Scot; the rest are American lugs. They find their sex lives lacking--or as one of them puts it ""It sucks. It sucks big time."" That witty riposte is delivered by Paul Walker the blond charmer who rose to fame in The Fast and the Furious (2001). Here he has been given the heart-rending role of uh Paul Walker and Im sad to report hes not up to the task. He speaks with the odd halting delivery of a marionette and the other characters seem inclined to ignore him. When he dons his period togs he looks a bit like Kevin Costner in Robin Hood Prince of Thieves (1991) though without the depth or emotional range. Walker has a serious crush on Kate (Frances OConnor) a bookwormy student who spends her afternoons unearthing medieval antechambers. ""If its between archaeology and you youll lose"" someone warns him. Theres a toughie dating Paul Walker or sticking your head in the ground. The students seem altogether bored by the Middle Ages as if time travel is an inconvenience thats keeping them away from study hall. So when David Thewlis showed up my heart leapt; at last I thought an actor with the heart of a forest brigand. He plays Robert Doniger a high-tech CEO who favors blue Oxford shirts sweater vests and glasses that dangle from his neck on a cord--the Bill Gates of time travel. It has the makings of a juicy part but Thewlis spends only fleeting moments on screen barking lines like ""Dont jump to conclusions"" and ""Yes we have a backup plan"" Also wasted is Connolly the Scottish comedian who gets stuck in the 14th century and looks like he wants very badly to be somewhere--anywhere--else. As we limped past the one-hour mark I thought you and me both man. The picture builds to a climactic battle between the French and English forces and Donner has a few slick effects up his sleeve French catapults that rain fire on the English castle and flaming arrows that collide in midair. He even honors the venerable movie tradition of the time paradox in which a character accidentally changes the future and then scrambles like mad to make things right again. What gets Donner really excited though isnt wormholes or clanking swords. Its honoring the glory of the French. Every frame of Timeline drips with an earnest almost defiant Francophilia. The students lovingly tend to their pal Francois who tags along as a translator. When hes run through by a sniggering English lord Kate exclaims ""Oliver had him killed because he was French""--this from a grad student who has devoted her life to studying the Hundred Years War. The films English noble is a nasty dyspeptic brute; his French counterparts are noble family-oriented folk seemingly with no ambitions of empire whatsoever. Why would Donner a veteran of Lethal Weapon (1987) and Superman (1978) take to such flag-waving? Maybe its a rebuke to the ""Rule Britannia"" ethos of Peter Weirs Master and Commander. Or maybe he just wanted to inject his limp thriller with something--anything--to make us care a lick. Bryan Curtis is a writer in Los Angeles. Follow him on Twitter.
