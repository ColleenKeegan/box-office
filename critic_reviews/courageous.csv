E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + ""Courageous is a movie with a good-hearted aim preaching the importance of fathers to their families and the responsibility that comes with it. But its also a movie brought to you by Affirm Films Sony Pictures religious-demographic division meaning that a certain amount of the preaching is literal. Its a blunt approach that filmmaker and lead Alex Kendrick (Kirk Camerons ""Fireproof) need not resort to as much as he does given the ability he can flash for sentimental drama not to mention wry humor.Kendrick plays Adam Mitchell a Georgia sheriffs deputy dealing with the usual push-pull of balancing work and family. Adam sure meant to make it to his young daughters recital but he had reports to file; he would run that 5K with his bonding-starved teenage son but ahhh hes 40. Meanwhile newly arrived deputy Nathan (Ken Bevel) is determined to make sure his daughter doesnt date and blue-collar dad Javi (Robert Amaya) just wants to find honest work. All of which seems either unimportant or all the more important when tragedy hits the group prompting them to craft a written resolution to be all that they can be paternally speaking.We would call Adams crowd introspective except that their meaningful conversations are too often just narrative-suffocating devices for stressing a point. At a cookout the guys discuss a workplace memo citing statistical connections between absentee dads and juvenile crime. Nathan recalling his own youthful trials on this score ""If it werent for my faith. . . Its like characters breaking into song in a musical It takes a certain touch to pull it off and here the serviceable cast just doesnt have it in them.And yet they do sometimes shine. For all Kendricks stolidity he delivers a couple of wrenchingly tender scenes. He also has a fun mistaken-identity exchange with Amaya thats like a ""Whos on First? routine. An opening auto-theft sequence involving Bevel is skillful and tense and nicely sets up the storys protector themes. If the film trusted in these elements more it might play like say ""Soul Surfer a more polished Affirm release content to do its uplifting gently. Tom Russo can be reached at trusso2222gmail.com.

"""Courageous"" starring Alex Kendrick a film review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesReview Courageous from Alex KendrickThe movie has an earnest emotional core and a message about fathers responsibility but it unabashedly preaches to the choir.October 03 2011|By Gary Goldstein Special to the Los Angeles Times Alex Kendrick stars as Adam Mitchell in ""Courageous."" (Tristar Pictures )""Courageous"" the fourth entry from the filmmaking ministry of Albany Gas. Sherwood Baptist Church proves a particularly clunky tunnel-visioned vehicle whose overbearing overlong script nearly smothers the movies quibble-free message Fathers must be responsible. And what of the importance of mothers here? It often feels like a case of ""Oh them."" Director Alex Kendrick and brother a and producer and co-writer a Stephen are both pastors at Sherwood Baptist. Despite the storys earnest emotional core actions and reactions can prove overly simplistic; black-and-white when gray is so clearly called for. The many topics raised a gangs drugs immigration absentee parents poverty a are examined with didacticism and platitudes instead of by mining their inherent complexities. Its a Scripture-conquers-all approach that perhaps savvily given the notable success of Sherwoods last picture ""Fireproof"" unabashedly preaches to the choir. The plot ricochets among the lives of a quintet of main characters stodgy Adam (director Kendrick); equitable African American Nathan (Ken Bevel); playful Shane (Kevin Downes) and unmarried David (Ben Davies) a all Albany police officers a plus Javier (Robert Amaya) a Latino construction worker the four cops befriend. These guys enjoy an easy jokey camaraderie (lame one-liners and forced ""boys will be boys"" ribbing abound) despite their personal and professional challenges. But when tragedy strikes Adam it compels this inexplicably selfish parent to take this fatherhood thing more seriously. To that end he enlists his four pals to sign a resolution pledging themselves to God and to their fatherly duties. Weirdly an outdoor pact-commitment ceremony although a watershed moment comes off a tad cultish. While the resolution strengthens the mens bonds with their children it also loosens the films footing turning it into an episodic series of mushy paternal moments and ethical curveballs meant to reinforce the fathers pledge. Fortunately an exciting climactic action sequence which bookends a tense opening scene provides some much-needed oomph. Performances are largely mediocre with Downes and Davies the most effective salesmen of the scripts subtext-free dialogue. As the central lead Alex Kendrick just doesnt possess the charisma gravitas or camera-ready looks to carry the day (think a more beatific humorless Dan Aykroyd). Also troublesome is the movies doubtlessly inadvertent racial stereotyping. Yes Nathan is seen as the near-perfect family man and an upright law enforcer but otherwise almost every criminal in town is also African American. In addition the retro portrayal of Latinos a of the sing-songy ""have a tortilla"" variety a like so much else presented here is more cringe-worthy than authentically well courageous. calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESCriticism of Cesar Chavez Google doodle Intolerance at its...April 1 2013Latino Republican walking a tightrope in Nevada raceAugust 31 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesFathersAdamLatinosCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/reviews/la-et-courageous-20111003,0,5984643.story?track=rss",200,courageous2,courageous,latimes

Or it?s just not your thing in the first place. The movie starts off well enough with agreeable characters passable dialogue and the genial tone of an episode of 7th Heaven but eventually devolves into over-the-top drama and a suffocating heavy-handedness. Prayers are made and answered on a regular basis a cynical agnostic converts and is immediately transfigured into a better man and characters stop to lecture for minutes on end about God?s plan while all but looking at the camera and into the audience. To the film?s credit the tragic accident at its center is handled respectfully and not mined for easy moralizing making it rather moving. But for all intents and purposes the theater seats might as well be pews. Following his last few films including 2008?s Fireproof director Alex Kendrick is clearly trying to bring popcorn-munching moviegoers into the fold -- but it?s more likely he?s just preaching to the choir.

Writer/ director/star Alex Kendricks story concerns four small-town-U.S.A. cops and one Hispanic laborer who renew their commitment to Christ and their children when one of them Adam (Kendrick) loses his daughter in a car accident shortly after refusing to playfully dance with her--a tragedy that exposes the little girl as merely a crass pawn in service of the materials mega-church-pandering message. When not focusing on guys sincerely discussing their own dads over post-grilling non-alcoholic beverages or sobbing over their deeply felt paternal grief regret and prayers the film wastes its time on tossed-off crime shenanigans in which gangs (here by and large played by African- American men in doo-rags) are posited as the potentially horrific future for kids not blessed with positive male role models. Earnest corny and--with regard to one officer giving his teen daughter some sort of heart-shaped chastity-related promise ring-- borderline creepy Courageous endlessly expounds on the importance of God in mens lives but fails to answer the more pressing question of why religious sagas such as this treat subtlety as a sin.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Fireproof shocked Hollywood in 2008 by grossing more than 33 million at the box office in spite of a paltry budget little conventional marketing and a cast headlined by Kirk Cameron a former teen idol decades past his commercial peak. As the box-office returns for Fireproof and The Passion Of The Christ attest its foolish to underestimate the commercial appeal of overtly Christian films in an overwhelmingly Christian country. Accordingly Courageous the follow-up from Fireproof writer-director Alex Kendrick racked up more than 2 million in advance tickets before its debut even without any Kirk Cameron-level star power. Courageous literally preaches to the converted delivering ham-fisted messages of responsibility to the most receptive audience possible. Kendrick confidently steps into the lead role of a police officer who is a doting father to his oppressively adorable 9-year-old daughter but shamefully and inexcusably doesnt want to go running with his moody teenage son. When Kendricks daughter dies in an accident hes predictably devastated but he finds meaning and purpose in his loss when he vows to become a better father to his son and convinces a group of fellow police officers as well as a kind-hearted devout immigrant construction worker to sign a resolution to become better Christians men and especially dads. Courageous is essentially about fundamentally good moral men proudly accepting the mantle of fatherhood but its conception of good parenting is relentlessly and predictably patriarchal. A closing monologue that delivers the message of the movie in a shiny little box explicitly posits fathers as the visual representation of God within their families and homes. Courageous pays lip service to the importance of mothers but doesnt have much use for women except when they gaze admiringly at the men they love while those men fully embrace their roles as household spiritual leaders. But it isnt enough for the manly men of Courageous to inhabit the role of God at home They must inhabit other untenable roles as well. A scene where a father takes his 15-year-old daughter to a fancy restaurant alone and gives her a heart-shaped ring granting him veto power over all her dates for perpetuity would come across as creepy even if the daughter didnt later lovingly admire her ring in bed like a gold-digger adoring her sugar-daddys gaudy gift. Courageous deifies fatherhood and fathers when it would be better off treating its central striver like a flawed human being instead of a paper saint.

Daily Edition Login to download Courageous Film Review 105 PM PDT 9/30/2011 by Frank Scheck FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS TriStar Pictures The latest faith-based drama by the creators of Fireproof definitely reps an attempt to move into more ambitious filmmaking. TWITTER This faith-based film from the filmmaking offshoot of Albany Georgiaas Sherwood Church goes after the issue of fatherhood and the responsibilities that come with it. NEW YORK -- This faith-based drama is the latest and most ambitious effort from Sherwood Pictures the filmmaking offshoot of Albany Georgias Sherwood Church. Like their previous independent hits Facing the Giants and Fireproof Courageous seems well poised to tap into a theatrical market starved for such fare with even greater potential for DVD sales. Another collaboration between brothers Alex (director co-writer actor) and Stephen Kendrick (producer co-writer) the film is set in the small town of Albany and concerns the interactions among four sheriffs deputies and a Hispanic immigrant desperate for work. The theme -- hammered home repeatedly -- is fatherhood and the responsibilities that come with it. Courageousreveals the duos growing expertise as filmmakers with its skillful blending of moving drama subtle comedy and several impressive action sequences including a well-staged foot chase and a harrowing shootout between the cops and bad guys. The characters are complex and well-drawn struggling with various personal issues that test their faith and character in believable ways. But the episodic and frequently melodramatic storyline contains enough incidents and subplots to fill an entire television season. A key story element -- involving the male characters pledging to sign a ""resolution"" affirming their fatherly duties and their faith in God -- seems both artificial and a cribbing from the ""Love Dare"" featured so prominently in Fireproof. The performances are effective all around with director Kendrick quite moving in the central role of Adam the veteran officer who suffers a horrific family tragedy that sets much of the films plot in motion. Non-Christian audiences may be put off by the endless proselytizing on display which feels more drawn out and overt here than in the churchs previous films. But the generous laughter cheers and applause generated by the crowd at an opening day screening demonstrate that these enterprising Baptist filmmakers clearly know their audience.
