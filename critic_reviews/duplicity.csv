The formula for a crackling entry into this genre is simple enough keep the action moving and the twists coming then engage in one late innings sleight of hand that pulls the rug out from under everything. Gilroy with an adroitness Hitchcock might admire works admirably in this arena turning in a screenplay thats more diabolical and pulpy than his convoluted directorial debut Michael Clayton but no less fun. He maximizes his assets and considering the wattage of his stars they are considerable. Although one could not consider the plot for Duplicity to be air-tight the holes are small enough for things to remain afloat until after the proceedings have ended. A post-movie dissection on the way home in the car will reveal some obvious plotting problems. For Julia Roberts (who seems to be in semi-retirement) and Clive Owen this is a much different sort of movie than their previous on-screen collaboration Closer. The tone is lighter and the chemistry changes to match. Instead of searing and raw its playful and romantic. One of the keys to the production working is for audiences to believe their characters are evenly matched and by virtue of actions and words this is evident. Their duels are via dialogue not guns and their weapons are words. Roberts and Owen provide characters who clearly love one another but do not trust each other. Thats the way it is in the spy business where trust is the quickest way to failure. Duplicity opens five years ago in Rome with the first meeting between CIA operative Claire Stenwick (Roberts) and MI-6 agent Ray Koval (Owen). The liaison doesnt last long and Ray ends up on the short end. Skip ahead to today in New York City where Claire and Ray are about to meet again. By now they have graduated to the private sector. Ray is an industrial espionage expert working for Equikrom. Claire is a director of security for Equikroms rival Burkett amp; Randle. (Think of this corporate battle as akin to the one between Procter amp; Gamble and Johnson amp; Johnson.) However as we soon learn shes a Equikrom mole and her new ""handler"" is Ray. All is not as it seems (of course) with the possibility that Ray and Claire may be playing a game beyond the parameters of their jobs - a game that is endangered when Ray takes things a little too far ""in the line of duty."" James Bond and Jason Bourne notwithstanding espionage movies have fallen into disfavor since the collapse of the Soviet Union which is something of a shame since when well-written they can provide a superlative source of suspense. Duplicity proves that even without the U.S.S.R. there are still ways to develop spy thrillers since companies guard trade secrets as jealously as nations protect their national security. With the element of death removed from the equation the stakes are less intense than they might have been in a traditional Cold War thriller and there are times when Duplicity feels more like a heist movie than a spy thriller. Regardless of how one elects to classify it however Gilroy knows where to place the pieces on the board and how to move them to deliver maximum entertainment value from the story and to keep the final twist - the one that happens just after the viewer is sure he has everything figured out - effectively camouflaged. (The existence of this twist by the way should not be considered a spoiler since its a requirement of the genre - like horny teenagers in sex comedies gore in horror movies and femmes fatale in film noir.) The plot is actually a little more straightforward than it originally seems but Gilroy uses a non-linear storytelling approach to obfuscate various plot elements. Instead of taking us from point A to point B in a strictly chronological fashion he keeps things pretty much in the present unveiling past incidents via carefully placed flashbacks. Duplicitys storyline isnt as dense or difficult to follow as that of some thrillers but it will reward those who pay attention. A mid-movie trip to the snack bar could result in a prolonged period of confusion upon returning. Duplicity is an unpretentious pleasure combining as it does the deft plotting of Gilroy the unforced acting of charismatic stars Roberts and Owen (not to mention nice turns by supporting performers Tom Wilkenson and Paul Giamatti as the rival CEOs of Burkett amp; Randle and Equikrom) and the suspense inherent in this sort of motion picture. No one is going to rank Duplicity among the great espionage thrillers or heist movies but for those who dont put unreasonable demands on the picture its a fun way to spend a couple of hours.

By David Denby Share Tweet Table of Contents Julia Roberts and Clive Owen as corporate spies in Tony Gilroys ""Duplicity."" Credit Illustration by Owen Smith The man and woman meet at a sunshiny garden party at the American Embassy in Dubai. They are both tall intelligent equipped. Julia Roberts is Claire Stenwick an operative for the C.I.A. She arrives in state heels a print dress cleavage her hair in a French twist. Clive Owen is Ray Koval an MI6 agent. The dark stubble of Owens earlier movies is gone; he wears a suit and tie. What follows is a very friendly duel. Ray comes on strong while pretending to be shocked that Claire thinks hes coming on at all. Attitude shades into irony which then shades into mutual put-on; each is amused by the others performance and relishes the others enjoyment of his own performance as well. They fall into a bantering rhythm so natural its already an early stage of sex an attraction sharpened by professional rivalry and instinctive one-upmanship. That night Claire sleeps with Ray drugs him and steals some secret documents from his hotel room. Starting with the first scenes of ""Duplicity"" written and directed by Tony Gilroy we know were in fast company and its a great relief. High-style flirtation once a glory of American comedy has not to put it calmly been much in evidence in the Matthew McConaughey era. The movie jumps five years from 2003 to 2008 and both Ray and Claire have left government service for careers in industrial espionage. They work for rival consumer-products giants Claire for Burkett amp; Randle which is lodged in a modernist slab on Park Avenue and led by the pompous philosophizing megalomaniac Howard Tully (Tom Wilkinson) and Ray for Equikrom stationed across the street and led by the smarmy other-annihilating bastard Dick Garsik (Paul Giamatti). Actually Claire and Ray both work for Equikrom Claire has been planted in B. amp; R.s counterintelligence operation as a mole and Ray is ""handling"" her. If all this sounds vaguely like a John le Carre novel from thirty-five years ago the resemblance is intentional. The sardonic joke animating ""Duplicity"" is that corporate espionage is now carried out with the same high-tech capabilities the same complex scams ploys and thefts that rival intelligence services used at the height of the Cold War. Is this true? I dont really know but the portrait of corporate deviousness certainly suits the mood of the moment. At stake in this new war is not the fate of nations but the fate of companies--especially a companys hot new lotion or cream that might allow it to dominate the market for years. Ray and Claire hope to steal the formula for one of these game-changers sell it to some avid third party and walk away rich. As was clear from Gilroys wonderful ""Michael Clayton"" we live in a fallen world. On rare occasions an emotion other than greed motivates someone and the world changes a little. Dramatizing that margin of hope--a kind of mutation into decency--is what separates the mainly cynical Gilroy from the total cynics. ""Duplicity"" is an enormously enjoyable hybrid a romantic comedy set at the center of a caper movie. But the froth arrives with steel bubbles--the tone is amused and mordantly satirical. On the tarmac of a small airport as elegant white corporate jets attend in the background the two C.E.O.s both beautifully dressed clumsily flail at each other in super-slow motion. (We seem to be watching a winking homage to the violence in ""The Wild Bunch."") Beneath the bespoke suit lies the animal. Except for this divertimento on the tarmac the movie goes like a shot with considerable suspense and many complex action sequences cut into one another by the brilliant film editor John Gilroy (the directors brother). Tony Gilroy likes to fool around. He teases the standard forms of plotting expanding the cinemas capabilities as a time machine. Not only are the various spies and their masters conning one another; Gilroy is conning us too with a series of flashbacks to different places (including a beautiful stretch of Romes old center) where Ray and Claire meet and deliver variations on the same conversation again and again. Just when we think we understand what they are up to Gilroy jumps to the past and resets the game. The conversation we have just heard that took place in Cleveland three months ago--how does it feed into the present in New York? Are Ray and Claire working together or not? The movie seems to be reshuffling itself as it goes along. Eventually the cards are dealt and turned face up. One may wonder if the fancy plotting is necessary or if Gilroy is just testing the limits of a caper movie. The answer I think is the latter and the narrative bamboozlements may leave some audiences in an irritated funk. My advice is to relax and not try to understand everything immediately; instead enjoy the idea that Ray and Claire are turned on by their mutual distrust. In ""Closer"" (2004) an allegedly serious movie adapted from Patrick Marbers acrid play Julia Roberts and Clive Owen tore into each other. This time they are joshing the characters lie test probe reverse themselves fall into bed and out of it. The debonair tone gives the movie a lift since their alertness to each others moods is often richly funny and sexy. Roberts usually takes the lead in trying out some scam and Owen always catches up though he can never quite get ahead of her. His voice rising in dismay Owen has a talent it turns out not just for bitter tirades but for earnest puzzlement. These two glamorous people make a terrific team. It will be interesting to see whether the grownup audiences normally slumbering in their caves until the fall awards season will come out to watch the graceful leopards at play. In ""Hunger"" the British video artist Steve McQueen has made an imposing feature-length movie that attempts to equal the discipline and fanaticism of his real-world subjects--Irish Republican fighters who incarcerated in Maze prison in Northern Ireland went on a hunger strike in 1981 led by Bobby Sands (Michael Fassbender). Ten of the men after prolonged self-deprivation died terrible deaths. The stated purpose of the strike--to force the British government to treat the men not as criminals but as political prisoners with certain rights--was of less importance than the real purpose which was to reignite the I.R.A. cause in Northern Ireland. Yet the movies preoccupations are as much religious even sacerdotal as political. McQueen and his collaborator the playwright Enda Walsh never tell us what the twenty-seven-year-old Sands actually did as an I.R.A. warrior. Sandss role in ""Hunger"" is to be a tormented prisoner in extremis his pale body a landscape upon which the most awful punishment and self-punishment is enacted. ""Hunger"" begins with the daily routine of a Maze guard who warily leaves home after soaking his knuckles in water (he will use those knuckles later to bash prisoners in the face) and then shifts to the grim entry into Maze of a new prisoner Davey Gillen (Brian Milligan) who refuses his uniform is handed a blanket to cover his nakedness and is then initiated into the rituals of protest by his cellmate on the corridor of Maze where the most rebellious prisoners are kept. The men smear the walls with excrement and spill the chamber pots under the door fouling the hallway with piss. Bobby Sands lives a few cells down from Gillen. He passes his orders on tiny balled-up pieces of paper that the prisoners exchange from mouth to mouth when they mill together at Sunday Mass. For much of the movie an intense silence reigns interrupted by outbursts of furious brutality against the naked prisoners who are smashed against walls or flogged with truncheons as theyre dragged between rows of uniformed thugs. In all Steve McQueen is a master of fascination rather than of drama--he creates stunning shots rather than an intricate story. Hes not for instance much interested in the relations among the men; he fixes on such things as a fly crawling across a prisoners hand or the slow disintegration of a starving mans body. The style is one of austere sensationalism. To his credit McQueen makes it clear that life is hell for some of the guards too and also for the prison personnel who have to clean up the corridor. But ""Hunger"" moves inexorably to the last stage of this Passion play Sands starving himself for sixty-six days and slowly dying as he lies spread out naked on a bed. Earlier in a powerfully written conversation Father Dominic Moran (Liam Cunningham) a tough Catholic priest accuses Sands of not loving life of having lost touch with the world or any rational political purpose. Father Moran is exactly right but the movie takes the opposite view--that the men are sacred in their anguish. In the end even though I recognized the need to be reminded of Guantanamo and of crimes carried out there I was awed but not moved by ""Hunger."" Sands is a violent man who dies in the service of a dubious cause and on a cross of his own choosing. Hes a Christ without humanity and McQueens aestheticization of his suffering and death becomes borderline creepy.

Goodbye Solo beguiles with two offbeat unknowns. By David Edelstein Published Mar 20 2009 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Universal Pictures) So much of a movies appeal comes down to whether you enjoy staring at the actors faces for a couple of hours. In Goodbye Solo (see below) there are two tantalizing unfamiliar onesnew maps to pore over. But the familiar face of Julia Roberts in the pretzel-plotted corporate-espionage thriller Duplicity holds surprises too. Roberts took a break after her less-than-stellar Broadway debut in 2006 and shes now more drawn which means her mouth is proportionately larger which means shes closing in on Heath LedgerJoker territory. But shes still nice to look at. Shes starting to bleed in the minds eye into Kyra Sedgwick who played her sister in Something to Talk About and whose face has conversely softened with age. Robertss features are tense but that works for the role of Claire (ironic name alert) a corporate counterspy who might or might not be playing fellow agent Ray (Clive Owen) for a chump. If this were a Mamet movie youd have no doubt Claire will turn out to be a whore with her eye on the mother lode but writer-director Tony Gilroy (Michael Clayton) is the most romantic of conspiracy theorists. Maybe Owenss charms (hes wolfish yet needy) have actually gotten to her. Duplicity is deeply shallowcheap reversals all the way down. But its a passably amusing brainteaser. At its center are rival corporations with CEOs played by Paul Giamatti and Tom Wilkinson who have a crazy hatred for each other and want to steal each others secrets. Claire and Ray ostensibly work for Giamatti the shadier and more repulsive but they have side machinations of their own. The question of whyapart from their good lookswe should root for them hangs in the air; theyre thoroughly immoral. But Gilroy resolves that issue satisfactorily. As he proved in Michael Clayton he knows how to write a final scene. He knows how to write an opener too. Its in the middle that things get laborious. Duplicity is certainly busy. Gilroy tarts it up with multiple gliding split screens (they work better on 24) and James Newton Howards brassy score gives the illusion of momentum even when the frames are inert. Gilroy does loop-de-loops with the syntax. Theres an overture in which Ray seduces Claireor has Claire seduced Ray into seducing her? Then its five years later. Then its two years earlier. Then its next week then last week then three minutes from now then 10000 years on when the robots have taken over. Michael J. Fox flies by in a DeLorean. After a flurry of climactic flashbacks we finally take in the whole puzzle picture. The last shot of Roberts and Owen is what weve waited two hours to see. Gilroy knows that after all the whizbang convolutions it still comes down to a look on a movie stars face The writer-director Ramin Bahranis stunning third feature Goodbye Solo opens with a medium close-up of actor Souleymane Sy Savane in mid-chortle. His face is marvelouswide reddish-brown with an indentation in his cheek thats the shape of a babys foot and laughing eyes that turn appraising in a heartbeat. He plays Solo a Senegalese immigrant cabdriver in Winston-Salem North Carolina and his old-duffer passenger William (Red West) has just offered him a thousand dollars for a one-way trip (to commence in a week) to a mountaintop Blowing Rock where the wind is alleged to blow heavenward. You dont need a weatherman to know which way that wind blowsthe implication is unmistakable. Solo thinks its a big joke. When it finally registers that it isnt he sets about injecting himself into Williams solitary life to the point of moving into the old mans motel room. And we set about studying each of their faces. Bahranis first film the contrived but beautifully shot Man Push Cart also centered on an industrious immigrant with a romantic worldview. (Its dashed.) This time he has made a true drama a tug-of-war between hope and resignation in which neither player openly speaks to whats coming. Solo engages William parries. William yields but then the walls fly up and he curses Solo out like the ex-biker he is. Solo keeps on. Hes a hustler in the best sense. He lives the way he plays soccer guilelessly but inexhaustibly. His exhortationsWilliam William big dog big dogcan get on your nerves but like the heroine of Mike Leighs Happy-Go-Lucky hes not just a cockeyed optimist. He has a baby on the way a family in Senegal and a dream of becoming a flight attendant. He and William both want to fly for opposite reasons. The black man who represents the life force who tries to revive the white persons spirit could be so Driving Miss Daisy so Bagger Vance. It isnt The abyss is always visible. Red Wests eyes have bags under bags yet theyre almost lidless huge and liquid. Those eyes let us inwhile his harsh demeanor shuts us out. Like his protagonist Bahrani never gives up on William; his camera never stops probing. He loves Wests face and he honors its mystery. The winner of the Camera DOr at the Cannes Film Festival Steve McQueens stark debut Hunger recounts the last days of Bobby Sands (played by Michael Fassbender) the Irish Republican Army member who starved himself to death in prison in 1981. The movie is a triptych. In the first section IRA soldiers who insist on being treated as political prisoners (not Thatchers hooligans) smear their cells with excrement and are brutally beaten by guards. Its excruciating but extremely stylish; even a long shot of a guard hosing layers of fecal matter off a wall looks like an art-school project. The central section is all dialogue fourteen minutes worth a debate (done in one take) between Sands and a priest (Liam Cunningham) about the purpose and ethics of a hunger strike. (The priest thinks its self-serving and immoral the bullheaded Sands charges on.) The final section is nearly wordless Bobby slowly shrinking to a skeleton his tight white skin erupting in angry sores. When he finally takes his last breath he is bathed in white light. The movie is a political remake of The Passion of the Christ only more aestheticized Its rigorous evocative and in spite of its grisly imagery elegant. Its a triumphof masochistic literal-mindedness.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor March 21 2009 Save for later Saved The film features cat-and-mouse machinations between former MI6 agent Ray Koval (Clive Owen) and ex-CIA operative Claire Stenwick (Julia Roberts). Courtesy Universal Pictures          View Caption About video ads View Caption of In case you had forgotten ""Duplicity"" is a reminder that star power can go a long way. Clive Owen and Julia Roberts play warring loving corporate spies and the glamour of their pairing often matches the swankiness of their backdrops - Dubai Miami Rome London the Bahamas.""Duplicity"" is also a reminder of the limits of star power. For all the glam and swank the film is essentially a bright shiny empty puzzle. The puzzlemaking by writer-director Tony Gilroy is clever but most frequently an end in itself.We are called upon to decode the narrative which flashes back and forth in time beginning in 2003 in Dubai. The gamesmanship between director and audience is meant to mimic the cat-and-mouse machinations between former MI6 agent Ray Koval (Owen) and ex-CIA operative Claire Stenwick (Roberts) as well as the corporate honchos they work for. Too often though I asked myself why the film didnt play itself out in a straight line. If it did maybe it would seem more conventional. Nothing like a little time-juggling to add some high gloss to used goods. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? But glossy they are. The whole look and feel of the movie sensually shot by Robert Elswit is a deluxe dip in fantasy-land. Even when we are ensconced in grayed-out office interiors instead of five-star hotels the grubbiness is handsome. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Duplicity For those who thought as I did that ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" the Brad Pitt-Angelina Jolie spy vs. spy slugfest was way too brutal for its britches ""Duplicity"" will serve as an antidote. Its a romantic thriller that for the most part keeps the violence confined to words rather than blows. Perhaps the most violent scene in the movie comes very early on. Rival CEOs Howard Tully (Tom Wilkinson) and Richard Garsik (Paul Giamatti) punch and kick each other on the tarmac in front of their private jets as their entourages recoil in horror. The mens loathing for each other is so livid that its comic. The sequence is played out in extreme slow-motion which gives it an almost National Geographic flavor. We could be watching two mastodons going at it.The verbal parrying between Ray and Claire is modeled on the sophisticated 1930s and 40s comedies of directors such as Ernst Lubitsch and Howard Hawks (""His Girl Friday"" especially). Not all of Gilroys witticisms are up to par though. Theres a big difference between bright and trying-to-be-bright.Still Gilroy must have relished jazzing the formula after writing the humorless ""Bourne"" pictures and writing and directing the straight-faced corporate thriller ""Michael Clayton."" The plot has something to do with getting the lowdown on a potentially billion-dollar-earning top-secret new product. What its really about is how sexy Owen and Roberts look together as they ""diss"" each other (their version of foreplay).Im not sure that strictly speaking either of them is acting. What theyre doing is more like extreme posing. With his clipped suavity and laser-beam eyes Owen at times seems to be playing a cooled-out James Bond while Roberts comes on like a luscious sphinx. The real acting fireworks come from Wilkinson and Giamatti and from Carrie Preston in a small role as a low-level corporate worker who takes a carnal tumble with Ray and is left ga-ga by the memory of it.""Duplicity"" may be much less than the sum of its parts but at least some of those parts shimmer. (Rated PG-13 for language and some sexual content.)The Great Buck HowardWith his mesmeric voice and big boggly eyes John Malkovich is the ideal choice to play an over-the-hill mentalist in ""The Great Buck Howard."" Buck was once a fixture on ""The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson"" (61 appearances as he never tires of reminding people). Now hes reduced to playing out-of-the-loop community centers and half-filled small-town auditoriums. Still Buck is a trooper - his first words upon stepping into a new gig are always ""I love this town"" - and theres something poignant and almost revivifying about his gumption.The movie which was written and directed by Sean McGinly is consistently good as long as it centers on Buck and his seriocomic travails. Buck has had a lifetime of embracing and fending off fans and he gets to do quite a bit of both here. He still dreams of hitting it big once again - in Vegas and on ""The Tonight Show"" - but hes smart enough to know that hes something of an antique. His ironclad routines such as guessing secret numbers hypnotizing patrons and locating a stash of hidden cash in the audience are so old school theyre practically antediluvian. And yet they continue to impress.In the end Buck is a mentalist who does not know much about his own mind. For that he employs an assistant Troy (Colin Hanks son of Tom who coproduced and has a cameo as Troys - what else? - father). This mentor-rookie relationship is rather hackneyed and is reminiscent of other better movies such as ""My Favorite Year"" about showbiz divas and their young lackeys. Colin Hanks is a pleasantly vapid presence and hes no match for Malkovich or even Emily Blunt who steals every one of her scenes as a wised-up publicist who doesnt fall for Bucks blather.About halfway through the movie McGinly unfortunately dispenses with comic cynicism in favor of hearts and flowers but no amount of sentimentality can erase Malkovichs brio. Grade B (Rated PG for some language including suggestive remarks and a drug reference.)

Starring Clive Owen Julia Roberts Tom Wilkinson Paul Giamatti Director Tony Gilroy Running time 205  Editorial Review Finally someone has put the fun back in corporate irresponsibility Consider ""Duplicity"" Tony Gilroys romantic pharmaceutical-espionage caper an antidote to news of bailouts bankruptcies and bogus bonuses The CEOs of ""Duplicity"" may be wasting millions of dollars but at least theyre doing it to screw one another not the taxpayers.Starring Clive Owen and Julia Roberts as a pair of ex-spies now in the world of corporate intel ""Duplicity"" pits two pharmaceutical companies against each other. Burkett amp; Randle led by Howard Tully (Tom Wilkinson) has discovered a cream that will revolutionize the industry. Equikrom led by Richard Garsik (Paul Giamatti) needs to steal the secret to that lotion. Both men are driven by a personal grudge as shown in the movies opening credit sequence in which the executives wrestle each other to the ground on a rainy tarmac.That a comical fight between two paunchy CEOs is the only violent scene in ""Duplicity"" makes it a spy thriller for those of us who feel a little bone-crunched-out by the Bourne series.And theres romance of sorts. Behind the scenes Claire Stenwick (Roberts) and Ray Koval (Owen) work their nefarious magic he on Equikroms side she on Burkett amp; Randles. But are they both really working for each other? And can they really trust each other?If theres a complaint to offer about ""Duplicity"" its that it never allows its leading lady much room to strut her stuff. That famous rip-snorting Roberts laugh is unleashed once about 10 minutes in and never seen again.Luckily Owen and Roberts both get to play off Giamatti who overacts gleefully.""Duplicity"" is a pleasant big-studio diversion a screwball romance with beautiful movie stars set in gorgeous hotel rooms deluxe office spaces and corporate jets. Its smart its for grown-ups and it lets Julia Roberts laugh if just once. Short of a miracle cream what else can you hope for from corporate America these days?-- Dan Kois (March 20 2009)Contains language sexuality and displays of obscene wealth.

ABOUT THE MOVIEDuplicity   1/2 (out of four)Stars Clive Owen Julia Roberts Paul Giamatti Tom Wilkinson Tom McCarthy Denis OHare Director Tony GilroyDistributor Universal Rating PG-13 for language and some sexual contentRunning time 2 hours 3 minutesOpens Friday nationwide  WATCH THE TRAILER By Mike Clark USA TODAY Though gadgetry has its expected place in Duplicity this brainy lark doesnt go in for tailfins morphing into machine guns. The rat-tat-tat is in the dialogue and the gadgets are sophisticated office equipment. Or in one key sequence a most handy cellphone. VIDEO Watch the trailer from Duplicity Writer/director Tony Gilroy made his debut as a director with Michael Clayton a heavier but deliciously twisty yarn. His new film isnt merely more of the same. Were it not for last summers French thriller Tell No One Duplicity would boast the trickiest plot structure in recent memory. Clive Owens and Julia Roberts (reunited after 2004s Closer) play spies who meet cute at a sunny outdoor ""do"" where the booze flows. He hits on her and predictably she verbalizes dislike. But before their work interferes they end up in the sack at a posh hotel. The twists encompass a series of mostly exotic-locale flashbacks that could have been irritating but instead enhance our understanding of the pairs equally byzantine relationship. And twists of course turn out to mean Clayton-caliber surprises -- which means that plot spoilers are especially taboo. Suffice it to say that the two eventually turn to corporate spying sometimes in tandem sometimes not. Its risky high-stakes madness involving the top floor-dwelling heads of rival companies who are introduced during a hilarious opening sequence. What a study in contrasts. Big shot Paul Giamatti is repulsively coarse the kind of guy who probably got to the top by letting the boss beat him in golf. His rival is Tom Wilkinson recalling his performance as James Baker in HBOs Recount a smoothie who picks your pocket but is urbane about it. And the two love each other like an NFL receiver loves the defensive behemoth who levels him after the whistle. Hollywood used to produce satisfying big-star entertainments all year long. Now for movie lovers the first four months of the year are as barren as the Mojave Desert. So with its smart writing delivered by an in-synch quartet savor Duplicity as the ideal spring gift.

"Duplicity I spy a sexy romp | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsDuplicity I spy a sexy romp""Know your way out before you go in"" Julia Roberts tells Clive Owen in the spy vs. spy romance Duplicity but the sage advice only goes so far.Julia Roberts and Clive Owen have plenty of onscreen chemistry in Duplicity.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. March 20 2009 Duplicity (out of 4)Starring Julia Roberts Clive Owen Paul Giamatti and Tom Wilkinson. Written and directed by Tony Gilroy. 124 minutes. At major theatres. PG ""Know your way out before you go in"" Julia Roberts tells Clive Owen in the spy vs. spy romance Duplicity but the sage advice only goes so far.It applies to the world of espionage that her Claire Stenwick engages in opposite his Ray Koval both of them former government agents (American CIA and British MI6 respectively) now turned corporate sleuths. The humble popcorn muncher viewing this amiable intrigue may have a tougher go of it since the ins and outs of the plot are almost impenetrable. Indeed the best advice for anyone considering this Rubiks Cube of a movie is that they dont try to predict the ending or demand a straight path to it. Not that writer/director Tony Gilroy wants to make it easy. Choosing lighter fare after the drama of Michael Clayton his Oscar-lauded helming debut hes determined to put some smarts into the world of double crosses and double martinis and bless him for that. But it sure does get exhausting. Beginning with a meet-cute and sexy set-up in 2003 Dubai where Claire and Ray quickly establish that neither of them are to be trusted the movie piles flashback upon leapfrog as the characters jet across the world Rome one moment and Cleveland the next.The main thread clashes two corporate honchos played with shrubbery-chewing zeal by Paul Giamatti and Tom Wilkinson. We meet them as theyre in the midst of a slo-mo knuckle fest - a brawl we later realize should be near the very end of the picture.The duking duo is tussling over the rights to an industrial innovation that has the potential to change the world or at least how one looks at it. The product in question - teasingly revealed after at least one red herring - is indeed a blockbuster discovery but appropriately shallow in the grand scheme of things.Natch Claire and Ray are in opposing boardrooms in the feud even though they frequently end up in the same bed for reasons both lustful and deceitful.But are they indeed at odds or up to something truly um duplicitous? The movie keeps returning to a bizarre encounter in New Yorks Grand Central Station five years after their first boot knocking in which Claire meets Ray and denies all knowledge of him. In her mind apparently the sexual hijinks lasted about as long as the self-destructing tape in Mission Impossible. Or maybe Ray was just imagining everything? Or maybe it all means nothing?Gilroy who writes the Jason Bourne spy movies is clearly besotted by the meshing of hidden gears. The excellence of the casting assists the movie in spite of itself. Roberts and Owen were last teamed as a fractious couple in Closer five years ago and the sparks evident then still burn. Roberts hasnt done much since having downsized her career to attend to her new role as mother but shes lost little of her star appeal.Owen meanwhile gets a chance to make up for The International which was even more of a corporate espionage muddle than this and far less satisfying.Theyd have to go some though to beat the couple Gilroy really has in mind Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn in Stanley Donens Charade. Duplicity finds devious affection in the proposition that you can love someone despite not fully trusting them and that theyd be all the sexier for the mystery.This makes for mirthful manoeuvres but can leave the brain feeling even more bruised than the heart.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Duplicity | RichardRoeper.com BLOG On Camera RR YOUTUBE CHANNEL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS Home    Movie Reviews    Duplicity Print Page Email Page Search Duplicity (2009; Rated ) B "" Amusing Rubiks Cube of a romance."" -Richard Roeper MOVIE INFORMATION Duplicity(2009; PG-13)In theaters Friday 20 March 2009 Summary A pair of corporate spies who share a steamy past hook up to pull off the ultimate con job on their respective bosses. Genre Crime Romance ThrillerDirector Tony GilroyCast Clive Owen Julia Roberts With ""The International"" and now ""Duplicity"" Clive Owen plays international operatives in back-to-back movies. You could cast Clive Owen in ""Shrek 4"" and hed probably want to play an international operative. Even when the guy is washing his car Ill bet he looks like an international operative. ""The International"" required Owen to look like he hadnt slept for two days. It was deadly serious. In ""Duplicity"" hes often luxuriating under the Egyptian cotton sheets in a five-star hotel munching on fruit as he engages in quadruple-entendre banter with Julia Roberts. Nice gig. Tony Gilroys followup to ""Michael Clayton"" (one of the best films of 2007) is a frothy Rubiks Cube equal parts romantic comedy and jigsaw puzzle thriller. The cinematography is stunning the dialogue is crackling. And the viewers head will be spinning as he tries to keep up with globe-trotting time-jumping plot which is maybe just a little too clever for its own good. Owen plays former MI-6 agent Ray Koval. Roberts returning to true leading lady form sparkles as Claire Stenwick a former CIA officer. She once took him for a ride in more ways than one in Dubai. Since then theyve formed a pact. Theyll each take jobs working counter-intel for a major corporation and theyll set up an elaborate ""play"" that will leave them with enough money to retire and spend the rest of their days between the sheets in Rome Miami wherever. Tom Wilkinson and Paul Giamatti play rival titans of industry. Little matter that their companies make products such as mouthwash shampoo. toothpaste and skin creams. They treat their rivalry as if theyre dueling heads of state engaged in a deadly Cold War. Each company has a team of spies who spend their days doing undercover work or holed up in high-tech labs amassing as much information as possible about the other operation. Ray works for Omnikrom and Claire works for Burkett amp; Randle though at times it appears as if its the other way around and just maybe it IS the other way around. They seem to be working together as we see in flashbacks that take us to Rome south Florida even Cleveland for crying out loud. But maybe Claires playing Ray and its possible Ray is playing Claire. Think ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" without all the shooting. With a jazzy soundtrack cinematography that seems inspired by Travel amp; Leisure and dialogue worthy of a 1930s film ""Duplicity"" is far more concerned with style than substance. Gilroy gets in some timely digs at the corporate culture and Wilkinson and Giammati have great fun lampooning ""titans of industry"" who never pause to think about the silliness of what theyre doing----but ""Duplicity"" is mostly about watching two terrific-looking actors dancing the eternal dances of love and trust and sex. You know a film like this is going to give you a twist and then a twist and then another twist and Im not totally buying the way it all plays out. Extremely smart characters all of a sudden get a little lazy a little sloppy. And I do think some viewers will get exasperated with all the jumping back and forth in time. That said ""Duplicity"" is two hours of breezy escapism. Nearly two decades after ""Pretty Woman"" Julia Roberts is once again in a luxury hotel exchanging quips with a man shes met under unusual circumstances. And we can still see how any man can fall for her regardless of the circumstances.

Photo Andrew Schwartz AP Movie review Stars cant save Duplicity 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Duplicity Comedy-drama. Starring Julia Roberts Clive Owen Paul Giamatti and Carrie Preston. Directed by Tony Gilroy. (PG-13. 125 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In ""Michael Clayton"" his first film as a writer-director Tony Gilroy weighed his screenplay down with unnecessary detail and he directed it in an uninflected way as though every scene had equal weight. The result was a movie that was hard to follow. Yet he saved it by keeping his camera on George Clooneys face. Clooney was the films locus of meaning. It didnt matter if you didnt know what was going on - Clooney was what was going on. In the midst of the confusion here was a character study. Alas with ""Duplicity"" it looks as if Gilroy has taken the wrong lesson from his 2007 success. His screenplay for ""Duplicity"" about corporate spying is more than confusing. Its opaque. Details are piled on and on. Two people will have an intense conversation about other characters but whom are they talking about? Who knows? And throughout the time sequence is juggled so as to deliberately keep the audience off-balance. If only the scripts Chinese puzzle quality were subordinated to the exploration of character - in this case two characters a pair of government agents turned corporate spies played by Julia Roberts and Clive Owen. But despite the considerable laying on of charm by both stars they cant make their respective characters into objects of fascination. They remain rudimentary constructs. Their dialogue sounds like something out of a script and their relationship holds no interest except for the easily exhaustible fun of thinking ""Oh yeah theres Clive Owen. Oh yeah theres Julia Roberts. Yes indeed and dont they look nice together."" Actually Gilroy could have kept his cardboard characters and saved his movie in another way - by making his plot-puzzle into a thing of absolute beauty. But he didnt. Instead we get a mystery that when it finally unravels lands in an unsatisfying zone between ""Huh?"" and ""Who cares?"" As a caper film ""Duplicity"" is a fizzle. As a mystery its a cheat. David Mamet is a guy who knows how to make movies like this and he does it by not telling us everything he knows. Rather he tells us everything we need to know. Gilroy does exactly the reverse He refuses to tell us what we need to know but he tells us every last thing he knows about corporate espionage and the various subordinate characters. The results are deadening. The movies pleasures are incidental but if you get talked into seeing it youll be glad for every scrap you can salvage Julia Roberts eyes. Clive Owen in a dark suit. (Where did he learn how to float when he walks?) Paul Giamatti at his comic best as another feral weasel this time the chief executive of a cosmetics company. Carrie Preston in a terrific cameo as a trusting travel coordinator who allows herself to be seduced by Owen - and shes glad she did it glad glad glad Funny stuff. Gilroy writes good banter though he spoils the effect of his best scene by actually reprising the same dialogue three more times - in one case believe it or not to have other characters comment on the brilliance of said banter. The good actors give ""Duplicity"" the sheen of quality. So do the movies various locations New York City. Rome right by the Pantheon. The picture has everything but a good script and good direction. Actually it could have survived the direction. -- AdvisoryPretty harmless. Pains were taken to stay within the PG-13 rating and the strain becomes obvious in the euphemisms used throughout.

In his mischievous follow-up to Michael Clayton writer-director Tony Gilroy again hauls out the corporate-thriller playbook but this time hes using it for entertainment only. Its no occasion for darkest cud-chewing on conscience and the evils of business. Instead its all glam sexy-talk and hotshot split-screen reconnaissance -- a Spy vs Spy with unusually gorgeous sleuths. Dont try to thumb through layers of meaning because there arent any. And dont expect Clive Owen and Julia Roberts to ooze anything but unleashed pheromones and charm. Their rattling dialogue has the cut-time speed and precision of old-style romantic comedy which tastes like honey and flies like darts. One of the movies pleasures is the chance to watch these two swells -- as corporate spies with ahem dovetailed interests -- mess so completely with each others heads that we never know which ones suckering the other. Even better neither do they. Whos the bigger liar Claire (Roberts) the ex-CIA agent who now works security for manufacturing giant Burkett Randle which is poised to announce a revolutionary product? Or Ray (Owen) a spook for corporate rival Equikrom which is trying to steal it? Is she really a double agent? Are they in cahoots? At odds? In love? ""Nobody trusts anybody"" says Ray exhausted and amused by the game. ""We just cop to it."" Figuring that out or not is exactly the point of Gilroys jazzy puzzler which exploits Rubiks cubes as an early plot device and spins the viewers brains in a similar manner. Hes obviously toying with us. Yet Duplicity is one of the least-confusing thrillers in recent memory. For a movie that devotes itself so entirely to narrative feints and switchbacks its a cinch to follow -- because Gilroy lays out every kink to the story in the clearest possible terms. Only in the final act does he lapse in this regard but by then it barely matters; its the rare twister indeed that makes any kind of sense at the climax. And even then the movie (edited by Gilroys brother John) has an agile visual clarity that helps us follow each turn of the screw. When the script flashes back -- two years ago three months ago 10 days -- the screen breaks into multiple windows 24-style showing Claire and Ray at some chic spot around the globe. When its ready to flash forward again the screen shrinks into the distance. Add in James Newton Howards swinging Latin-jazzy score and youve got a film that sounds as sleek as it looks. Its all very retro. Very  70s. Very cool. One of the coolest scenes by far is a slow-motion wrestling match between the films two megalomaniacal CEOs Burketts played by Michael Claytons Tom Wilkinson and Equikroms played by Paul Giamatti. (Two more spirited corporate thugs I cant imagine.) Its set on the tarmac of a gloomy airport as rain slashes the air percussion stabs the soundtrack and assistants huddle nearby with black umbrellas. First theres the poke to the chest. Then a kick. Then the shove. After that its all-out hand-to-hand executive warfare -- a spectacle that packs major yayas in these grim economic times. Superficially the film bears some resemblance to Mr. and Mrs. Smith -- minus the Brangelina hit men -- and for that matter any espionage caper that folds carnal humor into the mix. Near the end it sags a bit The gotchas too pat the MacGuffins too weak. When the mystery innovation is finally revealed in the awed tones reserved for a life-changing body product it sounds an awful lot like something else thats already on the market. Otherwise Duplicity is a snazzy piece of work tartly acted and cleverly made. Trust me. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Columbia Mens Palmerston Peak Water Shorts for 15 + free...

But it only ties for the best news of Tony Gilroys caper. The directors sophomore feature delights in being a movie with a capital M. Its rife with fine performances smart but not overly ironic repartee and a Rubiks Cube of a story line. A longtime writer Gilroy made a brilliant directorial debut with 2006s ""Michael Clayton"" which starred George Clooney as a lawyer in the middle of a web of crime and business. Gilroy still has corporate shenanigans on the mind with this tale that teases with spy vs. spy tensions then morphs deftly into a con-game scheme. ""Duplicity"" reunites Roberts with Clive Owen; they played hard against each other in ""Closer."" Their contempt is gone but their characters still play rough. As CIA operative Claire Stenwick and MI6 agent Ray Koval they leave the cloak-and-dagger trade go into corporate intel for competing companies and hatch a scheme. Together. Or so it seems. The stakes are high in the battle to bring to market products created for our daily grime. Miracle shampoos. Better-lathering soaps. More absorbent diapers. You name it. Theres some very tart writing on the subject including a riff on whether something is a lotion or a cream. As a great big corporate bonus that we dont have to hate ""Duplicity"" features Tom Wilkinson and Paul Giamatti as clashing titans of dueling companies. In fact as frisky as Claire and Ray first meet (at a Fourth of July fete in Dubai) its the face-off between the two CEOs on a tarmac that sets this romps darkly comic tone. Beneath a soggy gunmetal sky the two go at it as their cadres of yes-folk stand agog near two corporate jets. Its a deliciously absurd bit of business beautifully composed by cinematographer Robert Elswit. ""Duplicity"" leaps back and forth (years months locations) with abandon. There are reversals galore none of them cheap. Enjoy the scenery; trust that Gilroy knows where were headed. Along the way the filmmaker and his foxy leads toy with notions of trust. How can two souls paid to be duplicitous -- and oh so very good at lying -- trust each other? ""If I told you that I love you would it make any difference?"" asks Claire. ""If you told me or if I believed you?"" replies Ray. In this regard ""Duplicity"" bears more than a passing likeness to ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" the marital fable in which two assassins love loathe and recognize themselves in each other. But in this escapade theres no bloodletting. No one beats the heck out of the other. At least not physically. Competition however is the name of the game. Which brings us back to the cunning work of Wilkinson and Giamatti who play Tully and Garsik heads of fictional Burkett amp; Randle and Omnikrom. Each has the sort of dialogue that leaves elbow room for master-of-the-universe arrogance.Tullys rumination on fire singes with truths about discovering a thing versus marketing it. Garsik has his star turn at a corporate confab where shareholders greet him like hes a rock star. Standing posing his image projected on screens behind him hes a portrait of the corporate honcho who believes that making money is identical to making history. Gilroy clearly admires a good performance. He writes then coaches along the sort of ensemble turns that keep us alert to the tics of a whole cast for clues. Carrie Preston provides riotous relief as a Burkett amp; Randle employee duped by Ray in a ridiculously concocted disguise. Shes interrogated by Claire. A shot of the two sitting at opposite ends of a long table provides a still-life portrait of a different form of competition. At times Gilroys leaps verge on gimmick. But the shuffled deck of place and time is intrinsic to the three-card monte rhythms. He keeps us guessing even as we know hes gaming us.

Comments Duplicity Tony Gilroy has lived the screenwriters dream after 15 years of cranking out scripts (for movies like Armageddon The Devils Advocate and the Bourne trilogy) he got the chance to direct his own work and nabbed Oscar nominations for best director and screenwriter with Michael Clayton. In his second feature as writer-director he wisely sticks to the corporate espionage so icily portrayed in the earlier movie but this time no ones bothered by it; in place of the gravitas George Clooney brought to Clayton theres a cute adversarial romance between Clive Owen and Julia Roberts corporate-security professionals for rival companies. With its one-liners and welter of double-crosses it should settle on the video shelf between Intolerable Cruelty and Mr amp; Mrs. Smith. Paul Giamatti contributes an over-the-top performance as one of the dueling CEOs; Tom Wilkinson phones it in as the other. PG-13 125 min. By J.R.

Julia Roberts and Clive Owen play ex-spooks turned corporate spies; she as Claire Stenwick is a veteran of the CIA while he as Ray Koval comes from MI6. Part of the fun is watching these glamorous rivals in industrial espionage play each other -- or are they being played? -- during an all-out war between two multinational giants. Another part is charting the evolution of their romance which is fraught with chance -- or chanceless -- meetings and apparent double-crosses. At any point in the convoluted tale the question for Claire and Ray and for us is where reality lies. Yet another question intrudes Why does figuring out the puzzle come to feel a lot like work? Because ""Duplicity"" is betrayed by a surfeit of intricacy. Its ironic complexities tease the brain without pleasing the heart. I say this with a heavyish heart and an awareness of contradiction Im always complaining that so many studio productions target undiscriminating kids to the exclusion of intelligent adult audiences. Mr. Gilroys film which was shot by the ever-resourceful Robert Elswit gives grown-ups all the trappings of a sophisticated thriller and some of the excitement of an action adventure plus a view of corporate America that would seem perfectly synched to our sour times. The two titans of competing industries played by Tom Wilkinson and Paul Giamatti are Machiavellian in their maneuverings Draconian in their demands and Draculian in their lust for blood wealth and power. (An eerie slo-mo dream sequence -- though whos the dreamer? -- shows them on an airport tarmac battling each other like slimmer sumo wrestlers.) ENLARGE Julia Roberts and Clive Owen in ""Duplicity."" Universal Pictures Mr. Gilroys previous feature ""Michael Clayton"" also offered a bleak view of the business world -- a ruthless law firm defending an agrochemical company with blood on its hands -- but the drama was enhanced by complex performances Tom Wilkinson as the firms star litigator Tilda Swinton as the companys in-house counsel and especially George Clooney as the law firms fixer reclaiming his soul from a scrap heap of discarded principles. This time the tone is comic the performances are shallow though showy and the style is intentionally artificial. On several different occasions for example Claire and Ray meet and have the same ritualized conversation except not quite. Each time their lines are slightly different each departure from the previous ritual changes our understanding of what these two wily lovers are about. DVD Focus ENLARGE Oceans Eleven (2001) Comparisons will inevitably be made between ""Duplicity"" and Steven Soderberghs remake of the tacky Rat Pack caper. Several early admirers of Tony Gilroys film make the case that it gives Julia Roberts a chance to flesh out the sort of character she could only sketch in as Tess a caged bird with no reason to sing. Maybe so but Tess was terrific in her way. So was the cheerful uncluttered script that had George Clooneys Danny asking her if her new husband made her laugh and Tess responding ever so succinctly ""He doesnt make me cry."" ENLARGE Charade (1963) Its unfair to compare Clive Owen and Julia Roberts to Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn but Stanley Donens caper written by Peter Stone was clearly one of the models for ""Duplicity."" Shes a translator living the good life in Paris until the mysterious death of her husband. Hes a protean knight in tarnished armor who protects her from such bad guys as James Coburn and George Kennedy the latter equipped with a prosthetic arm like Captain Hooks. In the movies most famous exchange Hepburn asks Grant ""You know whats wrong with you?"" ""No what?"" he says to which she replies ""Absolutely nothing."" ENLARGE The Charge of the Light Brigade (1968) How to choose among the many films graced by Natasha Richardsons presence? Ive chosen this one because it was her first -- she has an uncredited role as a flower girl at a wedding -- and because it sets her life in the context of her family The director was her father Tony Richardson and the cast includes her mother Vanessa Redgrave though in a fairly minor role. The script was written by Charles Wood who used Cecil Woodham-Smiths book ""The Reason Why"" as the platform for an absurdist satire of Victorian attitudes that led to the follies of the Crimean War. -- Joe Morgenstern If that sounds abstract it certainly is -- again intentionally. Tony Gilroys game is to challenge us while entertaining us. His script is whip-smart imagine ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" with a high IQ. His dialogue has a surface sheen; if the lines dont measure up to Preston Sturges theyre bright and tangy in a modern mode. Still the climax is a disappointment and the movie lacks the essential ingredient of emotional resonance. Clive Owen strives for intensity -- his technique of choice in many close-ups is a fixed gaze -- at the expense of variety; his performance is attractive but not particularly interesting. Julia Roberts who appeared with her co-star in Mike Nicholss adaptation of the stage play ""Closer"" looks lovely and does her work skillfully but with a wry detachment that borders on dispassion. Its as if shes recalling in her own close-ups the simpler pleasures of earlier comedies that gave her not only good material to play but lively leading men to play it with. Sin Nombre By Hollywood standards ""Sin Nombre"" is a very small movie shot on a tight budget in Mexico but its a very big deal. This astonishing debut feature announces the arrival of a lavishly gifted filmmaker Cary Joji Fukanaga. (Hes California-born of a Swedish-American mother and a Japanese-American father.) The subject is immigration the language is Spanish -- with good English subtitles -- the scope is epic and the achievement though solidly grounded in conventional storytelling is a revelation. For much of its 96-minute running time ""Sin Nombre"" (""Nameless"") functions as a road movie -- a railroad movie. Freight trains carry unauthorized loads of human cargo -- scores of impoverished immigrants perched precariously atop the cars -- as they lumber through Mexico. The riders share a single purpose to make their way ever northward then try to cross into the United States. The images are stunning -- theres a sense of whole populations on the move -- and all the more so for being shot by Adriano Goldman in 35mm color. (The use of film cameras instead of digital equipment was a crucial aesthetic choice that contrasts grinding squalor with graphic grandeur.) The dramatic scheme is straightforward. An ardent teenager Sayra (Paulina Gaitan) travels on foot from her native Honduras into Mexico in the company of her father and uncle. Their dream destination is New Jersey where members of their family await the phone call they hope to make from somewhere in Texas. Though they succeed in boarding a northbound train in the southern state of Chiapas they intersect fatefully with Casper aka Willy (Edgar Flores) a desperate gang kid with divided loyalties and a moral structure thats barely begun to coalesce. Within that scheme the camera makes vivid discoveries chilling gang rituals; a national gang network of cell phones covert spotters and secret signs; a Mexican response to Central American freight-train riders that ranges from tossing oranges to throwing rocks. And within the harrowing narrative lies the affecting beginnings of a love story. The filmmaker directs his actors -- some of them seasoned professionals some of them in front of the camera for the first time -- with an absolute authority thats absolutely invisible. Scenes play as if caught on the fly by a documentarian. (One of the movies most conspicuous strengths is its quasi-documentary detail.) ""Sin Nombre"" makes no judgments on immigration as a political issue. Mr. Fukanagas purpose is to evoke the immigrants experience which he does with such eloquence and power as to inspire awe.

(Universal Pictures) Joe Neumaier Thursday March 19 2009 417 PM Theres a lot of doubling going on in the smart savvy ""Duplicity."" First theres the main characters motivations which seem to change as writer-director Tony Gilroy reveals more of what makes them tick. Then there are the films dueling corporate behemoths and their sneaky CEOs mirror images of the same bitter business acumen.Finally and best of all theres the unveiling of the 2009-model Julia Roberts who at 41 is sexier and more sophisticated but with the same sass she had 20 years ago. Roberts and Clive Owen are Claire and Ray who meet in Dubai in 2003 - shes CIA hes MI6 and someone winds up drugged - and over a series of trysts right up to the present day hatch a delicious scheme Cross over to the private sector scam a lot of money from a giant profit-maker then find a beach to lie on. The corporations they choose called Equikrom and Burkett-Randle manufacture cosmetics and their chief execs hate each other (as a very funny slow-mo fight during the opening credits makes clear). One firm is developing a product so explosive itll curl hair. The other wants to steal it. Claire and Ray work both sides to nab the formula for themselves and sell it. But they have other corporate-intel agents to deal with as well as their own slippery ethics. Part of the snap of ""Duplicity"" is that since its two lovers never trust each other we dont know if we should trust them either. And while much of the movies dialogue has a snappy intelligence it isnt frothy; Gilroy whose ""Michael Clayton"" was one of 2007s best films isnt interested in making something like ""The Thomas Crown Affair."" Instead as in ""Clayton"" he examines Big Business and the reptilian men - expertly played by Paul Giamatti and Tom Wilkinson - who run it while rewarding viewers who pay attention. The difference here is Gilroy wants to have some grown-up fun at the same time. And thats where Roberts and Owen come in. Hes refreshingly sleek apparently leaving his rumpled look under a bed somewhere but keeping his cool-customer aura. Shes wonderfully mature mixing some of Erin Brockovichs been-there-done-that attitude with a sly ""Pretty Woman"" smirk. Roberts has been away from lead roles since 2004s ""Closer"" (also co-starring Owen) and while substance has never been her strong suit Gilroy clearly knows where to dig. This is a role that the Julia Roberts of 1999 couldnt have played and thats fine. The one we have here is much better.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Whats more essential to romance the stability of trust or the excitement of surprise and uncertainty? In ""Duplicity"" a stylish caper/love story Julia Roberts and Clive Owen play conniving corporate security pros who keep us -- and each other -- guessing about where their loyalties lie. Claire ex-CIA works for a consumer goods titan developing a holy-cow game-changing new product. Ray formerly with MI6 snoops for a rival firm intent on stealing the idea. The pair shared a night of passion and double-crossing five years earlier in Dubai and when their paths cross in Manhattan theres no question that theyre spoiling for a rematch. The duos spy-vs.-spy skullduggery is complicated by the fact that the onetime lovers get an adrenaline rush from mind games. And on a deeper level they realize that no one but a consummate sneak could ever understand them. Despite numerous plot twists and labyrinthine intrigue ""Duplicity"" remains an engaging film because of its central characters. Theres a sizzling chemistry between the stars who are gorgeously photographed in glamorous settings from Rome to London to Zurich. Writer/director Tony Gilroy who mined high-stakes drama from corporate intrigue in ""Michael Clayton"" displays a wry sense of humor this time around. He undercuts the glossy globetrotting with a droll chapter in Cleveland of all places. In the same way he playfully reveals the bombshell product which is discussed as if it were the Holy Grail to be completely trivial. It is code-named ""Samson"" but it might as well be ""Maltese Falcon."" The film has its roots in the fast-talking screwball romances of the 1930s but its remarkably timely. Its the ideal romance for this Madoff moment when the ""American dream"" of earned success has been overshadowed by the nightmare of unethical transactions and the lure of quick wealth. When money constitutes the ""dream"" loyalty friendship and love are frivolous extravagances. Gilroy expertly keeps viewers guessing about who is gaming who. He repeatedly reshuffles the story with interlocking flashbacks that rewind the tale several years or a few days revealing new information about who is manipulating whom. Are Ray and Claire really controlling the play or are their CEOs (wonderfully played by Tom Wilkinson and Paul Giamatti) running a deeper game? Will the ex-spies respect the notion of honor among thieves or exchange love (or its potential) for profit? Somebody is constructing an elaborate trap for someone. But who? By the films climax audiences will find their assumptions challenged their suspicions rewarded their powers of observation tested and their expectations deliciously overturned.

In Duplicity the companies involved are entities like Proctor amp; Gamble - conglomerate purveyors of toothpastes and laxatives ointments and oils.The McGuffin - Hitchcocks famous thing that the plot of any good thriller spins around - is no longer a menacing code a nuclear weapon a deadly toxin. Its something to do with personal hygiene or shampoo.Try to sex that up.Well in Duplicity writer-director Tony Gilroy - the man behind the just-about-brilliant Michael Clayton - tries mightily. Nudging a couple of Hollywood thoroughbreds out of the gate - Julia Roberts onscreen for the first time since 2007s Charlie Wilsons War and dapper blue-eyed Brit Clive Owen - the filmmaker cues up a jaunty retro Mancini soundtrack and dispatches the duo to ritzy locales in Dubai London Miami Rome and Zurich (and Cleveland).Aiming for a romantic-caper vibe (The Thomas Crown Affair comes to mind especially when Gilroy starts deploying those split screens) Duplicity zips from one elaborate piece of hugger-mugger to the next. But at a certain point (for me it was Rome) boredom sets in. The moves are fancy - reversal twist reversal twist - but whats the point?Roberts is Claire Stenwick formerly of the CIA and now on the payroll of Burkett amp; Randle but - no real spoiler here - secretly working for its rival the mighty Omnikrom. Her handler there is Ray Koval (Owen) late of Britains MI6 and now running covert ops for a corporate boss.Claire and Ray have a history going back to their days as government agents (Dubai spiked bubbly a missing file). The gimmick of Duplicity is that despite their clear attraction Claire and Ray are by nature and training wary. Instead of ""I love you"" its ""Are you gaming me? Are you playing me?""If youve spent your professional life lying and deceiving can it be possible to trust the person you love?Interesting question I guess. But when you wrap it in scenarios full of computer hacking shareholder meetings and whos-scamming-whom? subterfuge the viewer - well this viewer anyway - begins not to care.Roberts does her knowing and knowingly sexy routine which either works for you or doesnt. Her do is reddish-brown longish and wavy so those who subscribe to the Julia Roberts hair/box office theorem can place their bets now. (If its long and curly the pics a hit; short and serious its a miss.)Owen shows more spark and sardonic wit than he did in last months banking caper The International. But only a little more.Tom Wilkinson the formidable madman lawyer of Michael Clayton reteams with Gilroy to offer a stern scowling performance as the chief executive officer of Burkett amp; Randle. Paul Giamatti is his counterpart across Park Avenue at Omnikrom HQ hamming it up like a cartoon rabbit.Wilkinson and Giamatti in fact do a slo-mo face-off in Duplicitys opening credit sequence - two corporate giants growling and grappling on a rain-soaked airport tarmac. Its the most dynamic moment in the film and alas it has nothing to do with the two leads.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

(Andrew schwartz/www.ximage.net) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / March 20 2009 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + In ""Duplicity"" Clive Owen looks like he just wandered in from the other thriller that has him trotting the globe in expensive-looking suits. ""The International"" is a business-like conspiracy thriller that opened last month and deserves a better audience than its getting. ""Duplicity"" stands to get a fairer hearing since for one thing its more conventionally enjoyable and for another Owens partner in entertainment is Julia Roberts who has returned from wherever shes been to show the Jessicas (Alba Biel etc.) and Scarletts of the world how its done.Written and directed by Tony Gilroy who also made ""Michael Clayton"" ""Duplicity"" is a twisty suspense comedy bobbing at the same end of the pool as certain Coen brothers movies and those Steven Soderbergh ""Oceans"" capers which is to say that its reasonable to expect George Clooney to show up and serve everybody mojitos.And like ""The International"" ""Duplicity"" is also a business-like conspiracy thriller. But the conspiracy here is pitched in the key of romantic faith ""Youre conning me"" ""No my love youre conning me"" Rarely has distrust been trumped up as such a sex fetish.Roberts and Owen play a pair of ex-agents - she was CIA; he was MI6 - using their years in government intelligence to make money as corporate spies. They meet at a party in Dubai and go to bed together. She steals Egyptian air defense codes from him. He spends the rest of the movie trying to wring an apology from her. He continues even after theyve teamed up to exploit a product war between two mega-manufacturers (of toiletries and the like) for a multimillion-dollar payday.Roberts infiltrates Manhattans Burkett amp; Randall whose regal titan Howard Tully (Tom Wilkinson) runs his company as grandly as some of Shakespeares kings lord their kingdoms. Shes installed Owen into the team of casual surveillance experts whom Tullys rabid opponent the unappetizingly named Dick Garsik (Paul Giamatti) has hired to steal B amp; Rs secrets.For the record Robertss characters name is Claire Stenwick and Owens is Ray Koval but Gilroy maintains an air of mistrust so extensive that you dont believe anything they tell each other starting with their names. In order to keep myself from getting hurt they were just Clive and Julia to me. In order to keep myself from being confused I tried to stop following the scrambled chronology and datelines -Rome Geneva San Diego Dunwoody Ga. When Owen tracks down Roberts in New York five years after she betrayed him in Dubai they have some lightning-round banter (hes hurt; shes sorry but she has no idea what hes talking about) that we hear them perform again verbatim in Rome two years before that. What are they up to? At some point I got lost anyway (not in the romance but because of it) and waited for Gilroy to stop toying with us and shake things out which eventually he does. In the meantime your time is better spent appreciating how Roberts and Owen are surrounded by so many superb character actors Kathleen Chalfant Rick Worthy and Denis OHare are on the surveillance team; Tom McCarthy and Wayne Duvall work with Roberts inside Burkett amp; Randall; and the wonderful Carrie Preston as a poor office patsy Owen seduces snivels her way onto Robertss nerves.This movie is a breeze compared to the lawyerly Sturm und Drang of ""Michael Clayton."" ""Duplicity"" is guided by the suggestion that America is a land where the Cold War now consists of two superpowers trying to dominate the nasal decongestant market. In both films Gilroy is clearly fascinated by what the average person has come to hate about large venal companies how they can get away with anything. But for the new film hes redefined the ethical contract. Now a corporation is only as corrupt as its most loyal employees. To that end the gotcha finale is a new contradiction a rousing anticlimax.Corporate anomie aside the engine driving this film is sidelong romance of the ""North by Northwest"" or ""Charade"" school. Gilroy still takes himself far too seriously to make a great comedy yet hes made a good stepchild to those older movies which were as concerned with their stars images as they were with clean classical storytelling. I appreciate the idea of Roberts trying to look anonymous wearing espadrilles tall enough to put her on the moon. Its like a giraffe to try to hide under a hen.Gilroys master joke reconsiders all those years of Robertss characters being incidentally vindicated and validated by money courtesy of love - in ""Pretty Woman"" ""Erin Brockovich"" and two ""Oceans"" movies for starters. Sometimes as in ""Brockovich"" the payday could be nauseating. But throughout ""Duplicity"" she at least is in charge going right after the loot herself.Even when Owen out-talks her Roberts always has the upper hand. Shes among the very last self-secure movie stars we have. And at the brink of middle-age (shes 41) her face has acquired an almost exotic refinement. She just needs a cubist to move the parts around. What she has with Owen (they screamed and yelled at each other in Mike Nicholss ""Closer"") is not as electric as what she and Clooney bring out of each other. With Owen the bond is strangely platonic. (Not for nothing the entire movie hinges on the retrieval of an elusive chemical formula.) But what they lack in eroticism they make up for with teasing comic connection. Watch his face go white when they banter over some underwear she says she found in his apartment.Their comedy is almost as good as a sensual spark. The Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie of ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" gave us a long frightening peek into their boudoir power dynamics. It was ""Whos on top?"" With Roberts and Owen its gentler. The question is ""Whos on first?"" If theres a problem with this its that the entire movie is predicated on lies being a turn-on. So ultimately it doesnt matter whether he believes that she loves him. Were not sure we do.When Roberts is in bed with Owen at a Roman hotel should we believe her smile? Doesnt asking amount to a kind of Hollywood heresy. In that mouth we trust right? But ""Duplicity"" so thoroughly equates sex and money that in a manner apt for a recession the audience is rewired when its over. You dont care whether they love each other. You just want to see them paid.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Sexy does not come naturally to Julia Roberts. Cute? Sure she can swing that. Adorable? Of course. Charming and delightful in a fresh-faced all-American kind of way? Thats her lucrative specialty. But as her cringe-inducing turn in Confessions Of A Dangerous Mind proved glamour and femme-fatale dangerousness have always been problematic for arguably our biggest female movie star. And the female lead in Duplicity calls for the kind of atomic glow-in-the-dark Rita Hayworth-in-Gilda sexuality that is most assuredly out of Roberts range. Angelina Jolie effortlessly conjures up that kind of fire-breathing sexiness. Roberts? Not so much. With Duplicity writer-director Tony Gilroy returns to the corporate intrigue and shenanigans of his directorial debut Michael Claytonfor the twisty tale of a pair of former CIA spooks (Roberts and Clive Owen) who leave government work behind for bigger paychecks as private operatives for a giant conglomerate run by Paul Giamatti. The two have a tangled tumultuous shared past that unfolds in flashbacks to sweaty hotel rooms in exotic locales where they loved lost and fucked each other over literally and figuratively. Roberts and Owen are dispatched to discover the secret behind a mystery product being developed by a corporation run by Giamattis archenemy (Tom Wilkinson) but trusting each other proves an even greater challenge. In order for Duplicity to work dramatically it needs leads who generate such explosive sexual heat that the very fabric of the universe will be rent asunder but Roberts and Owens chemistry is lukewarm at best. Gilroy doesnt help Roberts by making her character a glowering ice lady--all guile glares and merciless calculation. Too clever by half Duplicity is ingeniously plotted and zestily scored but its never fast or funny enough to make audiences forget theyre watching pragmatic schemers who care about nothing but money. Gilroy has a weakness for fracturing the frame into neat little rectangles and he stages a slow-motion fight scene for the ages featuring two of the least likely combatants in film history. But this champagne cocktail of a film runs out of fizz around the halfway mark. For a sexy comedy that tries and fails to recapture the sensual smarts of vintage screwball fare Duplicity is regrettably short on sex and comedy.

Guided by instinct his soldiers of fortune patrol a ruthless landscape of big government and bigger business where truth is traded like any other commodity and dissenting voices are more often silenced than heard. So its little surprise that for his second film as director Gilroy leans heavily on his favored tropes of international espionage and cutthroat capitalism. The surprise is that Duplicity is a comedy -- about two people who love each other more than they could ever trust each other -- and a superb one at that.Whatever one thought of the undeniably smart often unbearably overwrought Michael Clayton few would have pegged it as the work of an inspired farceur. Yet Duplicity is nearly as bubbly as the champagne whose corkage becomes a running motif as if the heretofore dour Gilroy were finally releasing a long-suppressed giggle. Even the corridors of corporate malfeasance are a markedly less sinister place this time around; where the fictional petrochemical giant of Michael Clayton considered staged suicides and car bombs the cost of doing business the worst one can expect from Equikrom Duplicitys Procter amp; Gamble-esque manufacturing behemoth is that it will steal its competitors garbage (and their closely guarded Ramp;D secrets).The job of executing this trash-heap skullduggery falls to a team of intelligence experts including two former government operatives whove retired to the private sector. Ex-CIA officer Claire Stenwick (Julia Roberts) is already deep undercover as a mole inside Equikroms chief rival Burkett amp; Randle when ex-MI6 agent Ray Koval (Clive Owen) comes aboard the Equikrom team. Theirs is a tense reunion stemming from an episode of drunken flirtation lovemaking and stolen Egyptian air-defense codes five years prior. But they agree to set aside their differences in order to focus on the mission at hand Penetrate the firewall surrounding Burketts new top-secret ""miracle"" product. It all seems straightforward enough until we discover that this isnt the first -- or even the second (or the third) -- time Claire and Ray have crossed paths in the past half-decade. By which point Duplicity is already a few paces ahead of us and its only just getting started.I could say that the fun of Gilroys whos-conning-whom bauble which ping-pongs about in time and place from New York to Rome to London and back comes from not knowing where its headed next. Thats partly true but the rarer pleasure is the confidence Gilroy inspires such that where hes taking us hardly matters at all. Like the tart-tongued screwball romps of the 1930s and Steven Soderberghs latter-day screwball Out of Sight Duplicity luxuriates in implausible situations high-caliber dialogue that ricochets off every Dolby Digital speaker and two immensely likable movie stars who possess the thing that no amount of intra-agency packaging can will into being chemistry. After schlepping his bedraggled self through the torpor-inducing hoops of The International Owen here gets to travel in far more suitable Giorgio Armani style while Roberts (at her most radiant) steals what may be the movies funniest scene without saying a single word.

Theres nary a dull stretch in its two-hour breadth and the edges and corners of the frames pop with colorful support from the likes of Paul Giamatti and Tom Wilkinson as Equikroms and Burketts dueling CEOs whose slow-mo airport-tarmac throwdown underneath the movies opening credits generates much early cheer. A Darwinian at heart minus the Coen brothers irrepressible misanthropic streak Gilroy seems drawn above all to creatures of habit and the ways in which they adapt -- or dont -- to environmental changes. So the spies of Duplicity keep spying (on their bosses and themselves) and the competitors keep competing whether they need to or not. Like Gilroy himself they exult not in the game but in the playing.DUPLICITY | Written and directed by TONY GILROY | Produced by JENNIFER FOX KERRY ORENT and LAURA BICKFORD | Released by Universal Pictures | Citywide Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

Julia Roberts and Clive Owen in the stylish but muddled Duplicity. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.March 19 2009 1042 AM Pretty Confusing Julia Roberts and Clive Owen in the stylish but muddled Duplicity. By Dana Stevens After youve seen Duplicity come back and listen to our Spoiler Special discussion of all the twists and turns You can also click here to download the MP3 file or youll find this and dozens of other Spoiler Specials in our iTunes podcast feed here. Julia Roberts and Clive Owen in Duplicity Duplicity (Universal Pictures) the second film from Michael Clayton director and Bourne trilogy screenwriter Tony Gilroy couldnt look and sound better with its lush cinematography by Robert Elswit (There Will Be Blood) and its witty retro-Hitchcock-ian score by James Newton Howard (The Dark Knight). Its got Clive Owen and Julia Roberts two actors who radiate old-fashioned Hollywood star power exchanging clever and well-crafted dialogue in posh far-flung locations. Duplicity is also stuffed with smaller-scale pleasures including a knockout credit sequence in which Paul Giamatti and Tom Wilkinson wrestle in slow motion on an airport runway. But shouldnt even a film constructed around a labyrinthine espionage plot have to make actual narrative sense? Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. To be fair I guess if Gilroy were to sit down and outline the entire movie on a flow chart or watch it with me on DVD while pausing for on-demand Qamp;A sessions I could puzzle out those details of the story that remain murky. But is it too much to ask that a spy movie unravel its secrets at least the explicitly plot-bound ones on a single viewing? To illustrate my point while sidestepping spoilers let me set up one of the movies most striking early twists. Roberts plays Claire Stenwick (a character name that inevitably invokes screwball-comedy goddess Barbara Stanwyck) an undercover CIA agent in Dubai. Owen is Ray Koval an MI6 operative who picks her up at a party in 2003. After they sleep together Claire proceeds to drug Ray and steal a top-secret envelope from his hotel room (something involving Egyptian military codes). Advertisement Five years later in the present day both Claire and Ray have left their government jobs for lucrative corporate-spy positions in New York. They meet again at a drop arranged by their employer a top pharmaceutical company trying to steal the secrets of its competitor. Their encounter culminates in a bizarre exchange in which we realize that either Claire has completely forgotten who Ray is or shes pretending to. Cut to Rome two years earlier Ray is suavely sipping a cappuccino outside the Pantheon when he sees Claire walk by (in the Platonic ideal of a summer dress which half the female audience will be searching for on Google next week). He chases her down a side street corners her ... and they proceed to have the exact same conversation word for word that we just saw them have at the Lord amp; Taylor perfume counter in New York. That two-minute scrap of dialogue repeated verbatim in two different places and times within the first 15 minutes of the movie creates an alienation effect on the audience thats vertiginous and thrilling. Why are these two spies repeating a seemingly private conversation years apart in different cities? Have they rehearsed it? Are they being recorded? Whos gaming whom? My first reaction on recognizing the repeated lines was one of willing viewer masochism Oh yeah Tony Gilroy mess with my head some more But--and heres where I need Gilroy on my couch with a DVD remote in his hand--the movie never does reveal at least not with enough precision to be truly satisfying just what Claire and Rays prefab conversation (which will recur at intervals throughout the movie) is all about. Thats not the only way in which Duplicity disappoints just one of the few that can be described without major spoilage. There are so many leaps back and forth in time so many twists and countertwists and double fake-outs that we keep losing track of who (including ourselves) is supposed to know what when. Theres a kind of pleasure in this repeated experience of bewilderment but its a pleasure predicated on the assumption that all the puzzle pieces will click together in the end. Duplicity does end with a whopper of a twist but its not clear how that revelation affects everything that came before. The conversation on the way home from a movie like this should consist of triumphant ""aha""s not bumbling ""wha?""s. But romantic thrillers do not live by twists alone They need romance and on that front Duplicity delivers quite nicely. Roberts isnt my particular cup of tea as an actress--shes too reliant on tics and her famous smile has come to constitute a kind of brand logo. Still her on-screen charisma is as undeniable as the heat of the sun and you dont need to be a Pretty Woman fan to get why Ray would chase her through that Roman piazza. Owen is perfectly in his element as the Champagne-swilling amoral yet sincerely love-struck Ray; in an era less obsessed with deconstructing its own icons he would have made a sensational James Bond. Gilroy explores the spies-in-love conceit with a trace more emotional sophistication than your average espionage thriller. Ray and Claires wary adversarial passion becomes a metaphor for relationships in general; we may not all be involved in international con games with our sweethearts but everyones had the experience of not knowing whom and how far to trust. In a way Duplicity plays as a less-successful comic remake of Michael Clayton. Both films share themes of corporate corruption and personal betrayal protagonists who are tricksters and idealists in equal measure and fantastic supporting turns by Tom Wilkinson. In Michael Clayton Wilkinsons manic-depressive lawyer was the lone voice in the wilderness protesting the corporate abuse of power. Here hes the most ruthless capitalist in sight coolly tending a single bonsai tree from behind his vast stone slab of a desk. Paul Giamatti is also genially unhinged as Wilkinsons competitor in the race to find ... but I couldnt possibly reveal the pharmaceutical MacGuffin thats the object of Wilkinson and Giamattis cold war. Its unveiling is one of Duplicitys cleverest and best-timed jokes and one of the few opportunities this stylish but muddled movie affords to shout out a satisfying ""Ah of course"" Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Real dirty tricks in our Bernard Madoff-infected era of diminished prosperity feel even less tolerable than they did two years ago; fictional dirty tricks feel less ? entertaining. The mood swing may result in a beneficial recalibration of our national moral compass but the course correction wreaks havoc on our appetite for playfulness. Todays worried taxpayer may not be in the mood for the diversion to be found in Duplicity a determinedly lighthearted movie about corporate malfeasance with billion-dollar repercussions. Like Michael Clayton Duplicity was written and directed by Tony Gilroy. And as with his earlier feature Gilroys articulate script is a stylish structure engineered to support sly double crosses fake-outs and gotchas. Unlike in Clayton though the twists in this new puzzle are their own ends not the means to express a more resonant despair. And puzzles feel so very...pre-Obama. As a result the quick-witted banter whipped up by Gilroy would mean little if it werent voiced by fabulously attractive actors. In this last challenge at any rate Duplicity is in luck The movie features Julia Roberts and Clive Owen as Claire and Ray a couple of corporate spies -- and a couple in love -- who must hide their romance while appearing to work as snoops on the payrolls of competing multinational pharmaceutical companies ferreting out the details of a revolutionary new product under development. The kick is that Claire and Ray never really trust one another nor should they since each is regularly punkd. And so is the audience; an accretion of flashbacks to romantic skirmishes that took place in other cities on previous calendar dates teaches the viewer to discard logic (and think fondly of the more energetic globe-scrambling action that powered Gilroys scripts for the Bourne trilogy). The movies accepted rule is that consequences dont matter not when Roberts and Owen look so glamorous and handsome together. (There Will Be Blood cinematographer Robert Elswit shoots the pair as if through a brandy glass all rich tones and honeyed sophistication; Albert Wolsky costumes the two in the classiest contemporary wardrobe Ive seen in years.) Tom Wilkinson and Paul Giamatti add cartoon color as the respective pharma CEOs the former a sleek great white shark the latter a more nervous and more amusingly Giamattian hammerhead. And to seal the deal on ? frivolity the secret product so desperately tracked turns out to be?well lets say in bald terms it doesnt contain powers of life or death. The filmmaker left that heaviness ? behind with the conscience-stricken company man played by Wilkinson in Michael Clayton. Duplicity doesnt have depth -- but it does have Julia Roberts in full Hollywood movie-star mode. And for filmgoers with scaled-back expectations that news may be enough. It is an undeniable thrill to see her again -- amazingly naturally inimitably starry as ever over 20 years into her scrutinized ? career her sleek horsey long-limbed charms ? communicable with a simple trademark beaming smile. Here is a celebrity addressable on a first-name basis -- not an approach ?recommended when extending a hand to pet the tigress Angelina Jolie. Julia is her own top secret product. But Julia -- er Ms. Robert -- definitely needs the right partner to set off her strong features. And here too this over-the-counter-strength movie fine for a tickle but useless for making sense of what ails the American soul benefits from prescription-strength chemistry between leading lady and leading man. Owen with his own hooded faintly ? dangerous sex appeal and onscreen history with Roberts (the two fought so nakedly in Closer) encourages his costar to let loose not just her pealing laugh but also her mature steeliness. Gilroy counts on a Thin Man-style undercurrent of sexual sparring to sustain our interest in two scheming corporate operatives despite the fact that nothing much else is going on. But if thats all he wanted he might well have paired Roberts with her old Oceans comrade in flirtatious tomfoolery Clayton star George Clooney. Owens edge only makes a duplicitous viewer -- me -- wish there were more at stake than the game.

Roberts whos worked exclusively in ensembles since winning her Oscar for ""Erin Brockovich"" enjoys sizzling chemistry with Clive Owen in this instant classic written and directed in high style by Tony Gilroy (""Michael Clayton""). Like his earlier film the superior ""Duplicity"" is set in the world of corporate intrigue but this time Gilroy mixes up a sparkling cocktail of a Hollywood movie that offers romance and laughs as well as thrills. MORE Welcome Back to Movie Stardom Julia Roberts Roberts and Owen play Claire Stenwick and Ray Koval spies who are working on opposite sides in a rapidly escalating corporate war between a pair of huge Procter amp; Gamble-like corporations. With its dueling ops ""Duplicity"" bears more than a passing resemblance to ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" which starred another hot couple of whom you may have heard. But fear not the new film has an IQ that is much closer to that gold standard for romantic thrillers ""Charade"" with Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn. Also noteworthy The closest ""Duplicity"" comes to violence is a hilarious airport runway wrestling match between rival titans Howard Tully (Tom Wilkinson) and Dick Garsik (Paul Giamatti). Claire and Ray have had at least one previous clinch of their own in 2003. Claire was working for the CIA when Ray was an operative for MI6 and they enjoyed a night of bliss that ended with Ray in a drug-induced coma and Claire in possession of his missile codes. I wont give away the exact nature of their current relationship - revealed in one of many tricky flashbacks - except to say they both have good reason not to trust each other. Claire is working as chief of security for Tully who is planning to announce a game-changing new product. When word of this reaches Garsik he orders Ray and his black-ops team to steal the formula in time for his stockholders meeting. Ill say nothing more about the extremely clever story except to remark that ""Duplicity"" contains more twists than a bag of pretzels. Among other things Gilroy pokes fun at the tendency in caper movies to accomplish goals in the most convoluted manner possible. At the same time his immaculate plotting makes ""Oceans 11"" and its sequels seem positively slovenly. This is a sharp-looking movie with a blue-chip cast. Standouts include Kathleen Chalfant as the troubleshooter of Rays team and Carrie Preston as a tipsy corporate travel agent who succumbs to Rays charms in the movies funniest scene. Bouncing back after the ludicrous ""The International"" Owen gives his best performance ever as the coolly charming Ray the brainy bad boy women just cant resist. The biggest news of course is that one-time queen of romantic comedy Roberts has finally given up suppressing her natural effervescence as she has done so many times over the past decade. Shes a formidable actress but at 41 she finally seems comfortable being a movie star as well. The camera still loves her and she seems to be having a blast playing the amoral Claire. So will audiences I think. Some of my colleagues think ""Duplicity"" which requires audiences to pay close attention may be too smart for the masses. I sure hope not. Theyd be missing a helluva treat. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next OPRAH MOURNS LOSS OF DOG Read Next OPRAH MOURNS LOSS OF DOG Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 42626 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 21540 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 14896 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"Duplicity New movie from Julie Roberts and Clive Owens - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Duplicity -- 4 out of 5 stars Clive Owen and Julia Roberts Universal Universal Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Duplicity is a romantic comedy with spies a heist picture with sex and a corporate intrigue thriller filled with funny banter.It re-teams Julia Roberts with one of the few leading men who can hold his own with her Clive Owen serves her up as another sassy leading lady with legs and gives us yet another taste of how Owen might have played James Bond. All this from the fellow who made Michael Clayton a dry dark and much more sinister look at malignant malfeasance among the Fortune 500.Duplicity sparkles with wit from the first time MI-6 spy Ray eyes CIA spook Claire at a July 4 party at the U.S. consulate in Dubai. ""I thought we were checking each other out.""""Maybe you were drunk.""""If I was drunk Id be coming on to you.""Clothes are shed tender embraces shared and doggone if Ms. Undercover America doesnt rob Mr. Brit-who-should-know-better under the covers. Cut to years later He spots her in another city and launches into a nasty spiel. ""A little professional courtesy would make this a lot less awkward""""Youre harassing me""And back and forth it goes. Theyve moved on from their government gigs. Theyre spying for the big boys now the corporations. They might work together well. If only they can get past their trust issues.But Julia and Clive arent the only winning couple here. In the opening credits we see a (silent slow-motion) meltdown between two titans of commerce a raging rant in the private plane corner of a major airport that ends with the chief of one gigantic consumer products firm (Tom Wilkinson also in Michael Clayton) tackling the head of another ( Paul Giamatti). Their lip-smacking loathing their paranoia is what drives Duplicity. All the flirting the flitting back and forth through the years of Claire and Rays ""relationship"" is underscored by the instinctual mistrust between their two employers.Director Tony Gilroy deftly mixes comedy with suspense as we see the extreme measures corporations take to steal one anothers secrets and protect their own from theft. The spy ware here would leave Tom Clancy slack-jawed.Best of all Gilroy shot this and had it edited and scored like a sexy 60s caper picture -- conga drums and horns split screens spy jargon (""Moscow rules"") and tense moments when ""Were blown"" could end the whole operation -- very Thomas Crown Affair.Its a little confusing and a little too long to sustain the duplicitous finale Gilroy delivers. But Duplicity brings smart sexy sophistication back to a genre -- several genres -- that could stand to be Bourne again.

It also features a face or two that makes wasting your time and I.Q. a not entirely unpleasant experience. Julia Roberts and Clive Owen are Claire and Ray two C.I.A. agents who meet cute at a U.S. Consulate cocktail party in Dubai in 2003 and sack out for a memorable one-night stand. While hes still asleep she steals his top-secret files and disappears. Five years later he spots her again in Grand Central Station. By now shes been promoted to assistant director of counterintelligence and although she pretends she doesnt know him the affair starts all over again. But wait. When the film cuts to ""2 Years Earlier"" we learn that he spotted her once before in the Piazza Navona in Rome and they locked themselves in a hotel suite where they sucked face for three days. The rest of the film hopscotches from Manhattan to the Bahamas to Miami Beach to London to Cleveland cataloguing their tricks maneuvers and travel requisitions as they outsmart each other between popping Champagne corks and making ticky-ticky. Nothing they do makes any sense but finally something transpires that vaguely resembles a plot If theyre so good at cheating each other says Claire why not take their talents to the private sector? Think of the money to be made bilking major corporations out of enough money to live happily ever after (40 million by her mental calculator)? So they go to work for rival corporations that make millions introducing and marketing new products. Ray comes up with an idea for frozen pizza but Claires got a better idea ""Project Samson"" revolving around a top-secret product both companies would kill for. Tom Wilkinson and Paul Giamatti are the adversarial CEOs who would do anything short of murder to control the marketing world. Among the wasted but watchable top-deck personnel who do their illegal bidding youll find such seasoned Broadway talents as Kathleen Chalfant Denis OHare and Thomas McCarthy. Slumming never looked so good. While the stars rant accuse resent interrogate distrust and betray each other with dialogue too precious smart and fast-paced to be even momentarily believable I stopped worrying about what they were doing and just leaned back to enjoy looking at them and their Technicolor travelogue. Ms. Roberts keeps her trademark picket fence grin to a minimum and Mr. Owen looks nice with short hair and clean-shaven for a change modeling a Giorgio Armani wardrobe to die for. Like Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman neither one of them has a clue how to choose a script worth reading or a movie worth acting in but theyre always camera-ready. As the title Duplicity implies everyone in the movie has a split personality and a dual identity and when you find out that the chicanery the jealousy and the years of sweat and mystery and computer math add up to a secret formula for a shampoo that cures baldness ... you might just want to make a citizens arrest. After more break-ins than Watergate the big twist ending everything leads up to asks Whose duplicity will result in the final scam of scams? By that time youll be too sated with entertainment value to care. Duplicity is a romp and theres no nudity violence or even the sight of a gun involved. Today at the movies you learn to be grateful for small favors. rreedobserver.com Comment Filed under Clive Owen Duplicity Julia Roberts movie On the Town Paul Giamatti Tom Wilkinson Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Radiohead Transformed Madison Square Garden Into A Moon Shaped Pool Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://www.observer.com/2009/movies/beautiful-julia-and-clive-make-sweet-lies-together,200,duplicity35,duplicity,observer

Duplicity Director Tony Gilroy. Cast Clive Owen Julia Roberts Tom Wilkinson. Rating PG-13 for language and some sexual content. Great Good Fair Bad Bomb Related Julia Roberts considered career Luscious movie pairings But to say that ""Duplicity"" lives up to those expectations would be well duplicitous. The story about two spies and lovers involved in industrial espionage is intriguing enough. But it eventually falls victim to one or two twists too many needlessly complicating an already complex plot. And whatever chemistry Roberts and Owen had on display in 2004s ""Closer"" is sorely lacking here. Part of that is by design; because of their training and background their characters relationship is based on distrust of everyone and everything including each other. But part of it is just a lack of chemistry. Roberts in particular often seems slightly annoyed to be present a vibe thats contagious. We meet Ray (Owen) who works for MI-5 and Claire (Roberts) a CIA agent at a party in Dubai a few years back. He seduces her or so he thinks. She drugs him steals some information and disappears. They meet again in the present startled to learn that they now will be working together. Theyre both involved in industrial espionage for a huge company at war - almost literally with another huge company. The turnabouts and double-crosses pile up fast and furiously. Suffice it to say that everyones working someone and nothing is what it seems. Further adding to the complexity of the plot is Gilroys penchant for playing with time. At first its confusing then interesting eventually annoying particularly in regards to a bit of dialogue thats repeated throughout. Yes we learn why its repeated and its crucial to the plot. But the payoff isnt necessarily worth the effort. This isnt to say that ""Duplicity"" is without value. Gilroy once again gets an outstanding performance from Tom Wilkinson who was nominated for an Oscar for his work as a so-crazy-hes-sane lawyer in ""Clayton."" Here hes the head of one of the corporations competitive to a fault but also smart in a scheming kind of way. Paul Giamatti has his moments as the chief of the rival company but he lapses into bug-eyed antics so over the top that they eventually undercut his character. (That said his self-centered address to shareholders is brilliant exactly what youd imagine the leaders of AIG and other companies doing. Its great but its chilling.) Gilroys facility with dialogue again serves him well particularly when the spies are talking shop. But the banter between Ray and Claire is where things unravel. Theyre supposedly in love presumably because they have so much in common. But trust is a key ingredient in a relationship and as were reminded at almost every turn when theyre together its something they lack. Their time together should be entertaining but instead its grating. Given Gilroys fondness for jumping back and forth in time perhaps wed be forgiven for wanting him to jump ahead to the next thing.

An ultra-sophisticated love story between two corporate spies with pronounced mutual trust issues ""Duplicity"" is a brainy non-violent ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" the film ""Intolerable Cruelty"" wanted to be a ""Trouble in Paradise"" for modern times. Smart droll and dazzling to look at and listen to writer-director Tony Gilroys effervescent intricately plotted puzzler proves in every way superior to his 2007 success ""Michael Clayton."" The twisty time jumping narrative forces viewers to keep on their toes and it could well be that ""Duplicity"" is too smart for its own good as far as the popcorn masses are concerned. Still this is about as good as it gets these days for sharp-minded Hollywood entertainment made for an intelligent audience and Universal can only hope that Julia Roberts in an excellent return to leading lady form still has the B.O. pull to put this one over. Although the depredations of the corporate world again lie at the heart of things for Gilroy this time he has a lot more fun with them setting the tone with a slap-happy opening credits sequence backgrounded by two titans of industry (Tom Wilkinson and Paul Giamatti) coming to blows in exaggerated slow motion in front of their respective private jets as aghast entourages look on. The stakes are very high here in both love and commerce the participants are all savvy and hold their cards close and the winners are those who play the deepest game; who they may be Gilroy craftily keeps a mystery until the very end. In the meantime there is exceptional pleasure to be taken from watching the consummate pros before and behind the camera play such captivating make-believe with such engaging characters. In a tangy Dubai-set opener that establishes a sexy vibe that never diminishes across two hours MI6 agent Ray Koval (Clive Owen) insinuates himself into bed with CIA op Claire Stenwick (Roberts). Five years later in 2008 Ray encounters Claire again in Grand Central Station but she adamantly insists she doesnt remember him. Over the course of the film their opening gambit repartee becomes a running gag that assumes different flavors based on the time and place just one clever invention in a film full of them. Lured from government work into the far more lucrative world of corporate counter-intelligence the mutually irresistible lovers plot a scheme by which they will spy for rival firms - Burkett amp; Randle headed by Howard Tully (Wilkinson) and Omnikrom led by Dick Garsik (Giamatti) - and hope to make off with enormously profitable secrets. Triggering such an opportunity is a procured handwritten letter revealing Bamp;Rs imminent announcement of a bombshell product guaranteed to generate giant profits. But both its nature and formula must be obtained for the discovery to be any use to either Omnikrom or the two moles. Claire and Ray understand one another perfectly They both know neither will ever meet a more suitable match but they also have every reason not to trust the other; Claire pulls a fast one on Ray on their initial tryst while Ray among other deceptions unsettles Claire by seducing a vulnerable office drone (a terrific Carrie Preston) to procure vital information. Neither wants to be the first to show weakness by uttering an incontrovertible truth or by confessing love for the other. All this game playing provides Gilroy with the opportunity to refashion the urbane snappy repartee of 1930s romantic comedies in a darker harder edged contemporary context. By pulling off this high-wire act he shows himself to be one of the few current writers who could possibly have held his own in the august company of his stage-and-newspaper-trained forebears. His dialogue has snap rhythm and wit and all the actors in the picture show their appreciation by making it sing or sting as the occasion requires. With knowledge no doubt acquired in part while toiling on the three ""Bourne"" features Gilroy juices the drama with a dazzling array of surveillance techniques the two companies use to pry into the others business; whether theyre true or not theyre entirely credible in context as is the unreserved corporate avarice that audiences will more eagerly swallow today than they might have even a year ago. The screenplay shuffles the chronological deck -- the action perpetually shifts to ""2 Years Ago"" ""10 Days Earlier"" and so on -- in ways that only a complete physical exam could prove to be necessary rather than whimsical. But what the calendar jumbling does accomplish is to provide a nice cyclical pattern to the intimate scenes between the romantic leads which keeps the sexual heat turned up in the midst of so much devious plotting and derring-do. No matter where in the world the action takes them - settings include Rome Switzerland the Bahamas Miami London San Diego and Cleveland in addition to New York and Dubai - Claire and Ray always find a time and place to jump-start their romance which provides an emotional core to parallel the films intellectual assessment of corporate mischief. On the surface ""Duplicity"" is escapist fare fronted by beautiful stars wearing gorgeous clothes in chic locations made to look extra-alluring by Robert Elswits shimmering camerawork. But these are routine qualities compared to some of the other levels on which the film excels most notably in its adroit synthesis of pulsing drama bright humor heady romance unapologetic maturity zero tolerance for fools and cheeky awareness of its rejiggered conventions. Reteamed after working together in ""Closer"" (2004) Roberts and Owen manifest excellent chemistry. An ultra-competent control freak Claire is a woman almost impossible to surprise or impress and Roberts stature feeds into these traits. Her glances and glacial stare-downs rep some of her best moments here but shes also very good at recalibrating Claires degree of toughness when Ray demonstrates he can match her at her own game. As for Owen this reps a very welcome rebound from the similarly globe-trotting ""The International"" where he was locked into a state of unrelieved grubbiness and anger. Here he looks debonair (certain moments suggest what he might have been like as James Bond) and keeps a sensitive finger on his co-stars pulse which serves to quicken his own. Aside from Wilkinson and Giamatti both delicious as kings of industry whose egos and ambitions know no bounds supporting cast has been adroitly filled out with moderately familiar faces that have the virtue of not popping up several times a year in movies or on TV. Films craftsmanship is of the highest level from Kevin Thompsons production design that complements the locations in evoking many settings and Albert Wolskys always flattering costume design to a vibrant nicely spiced score by James Newton Howard. As neither the shooting nor the editing trade in trendy jitters or jumpiness one wobbly hand-held shot stands out like a black eye. In every respect ""Duplicity"" is a film made with total assurance and savoir faire. DuplicityProductionA Universal release presented in association with Relativity Media.
