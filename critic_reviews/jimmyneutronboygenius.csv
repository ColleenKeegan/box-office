Its the Earth brats vs. the evil egg Yokians in ""Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius"" a zippy little animated sci-fier around which Paramount and Nickelodeon are trying to build a giant multimedia franchise. Amiable enough on its own terms and sporting a distinctively stylized throwback look achieved through ultra-pristine 3-D CGI this sixth Par-Nick bigscreen venture plays very young to kids no older than 8 or so. But since this is the same demographic that has driven the partners ""Rugrats"" franchise they ought to come out very nicely with this sole Christmas release aimed at the crowd too young for ""The Lord of the Rings."" Jimmy first saw life in a 1995 40-second video short called ""Runaway Rocket Boy"" later expanded into ""The Adventures of Johnny Quasar."" Character has been popping up in various contexts on Nickelodeon all year is central to some new Internet and videogames is the basis for a many-tentacled merchandising effort and will be the subject of a television special next year in preparation for the launch of the ""The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius"" series in fall 2002. If they forgot anything theyre bound to think of it in the interim. Moppet appeal of the present feature rests in three cant-miss concepts -- cool gadgets the desire to see grownups disappear and space travel. Pic delivers on all three points and doesnt have to do a whole lot more. Looking like Bobs Big Boys long-lost twin brother with his swirled-and-peaked brown hairdo and head twice the size of his body Jimmy (voiced by Debi Derryberry) is a precocious science nerd whos built his own rocket ship gets around with a retractable jetpack in his backpack has launched a toaster into orbit owns a mechanical dog named Goddard made up of spare parts and has a basementful of technical gizmos his parents dont even know about. Jimmy is without question the resident brain of Retroville an Ozzie amp; Harriet community decked out in 50s style and conventional habits laced with contempo touches such as home computers. The smart-mouthed Cindy Vortex (Carolyn Lawrence) is his math-science rival asthma-plagued best friend Carl Wheezer (Rob Paulsen) tries to keep up as best he can and Nick (Candi Milo) is the inevitable handsome badboy there to put rebellious notions into innocent little heads. Nick also scares the bejeesus out of the others when he tells them a campfire story about three filmmakers who get lost in the woods. Driving the first-half action is the kids common desire to attend the opening of the long-awaited Retroland Amusement Park. Thwarted by their parents refusal to allow them out on a school night the goody-goodies are challenged by Nick to sneak out which is where Jimmys incredible shrinking ray invention comes in handy. Even cooler than Retroland however is the kids discovery that their moms and dads have suddenly all vanished abducted in true 50s style by gooey green people-eaters called Yokians to the latters distant planet. The aliens who are blob-like creatures confined to egg-like encasements are led by the scarily unpredictable and petulant King Goobot (Patrick Stewart) who is seldom without his comically obsequious factotum Ooblar (Martin Short). When it dawns on the kids that their parents actually are useful once in a while the tykes blast off into outer space to rescue the hapless old folks. Jimmy takes the lead in his hand-crafted open-cockpit spacecraft and the most exciting shots in the picture are those of the rag-tag band of space rats being conveyed through the void aboard a variety of Retroland park rides including a roller coaster and best of all a giant octopus with rotating tentacles. Needless to say the parents dont end up on the eggs plates and Retroville is restored to its impeccable normalcy in preparation for the TV series and any sequel that might become necessary based on this films profitability. Script pops with vigor and enough diverting ideas to keep the craft aloft for the quick 83-minute flight and the colorful visual style has the exaggerated look of 50s cartoons and puppetry given a hard CGI edge. Technical quality is first-rate and John Debneys peppy score is abetted by more than a dozen tunes from the likes of such kid-friendly artists as Aaron Carter Britney Spears N Sync and the Backstreet Boys.

Starring Eduardo Noriega and Marisa Paredes. Directed by Guillermo Del Toro. (Rated R. 106 minutes. In Spanish with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) Gothic horror lingering fascism and a childs bravery come together in ""The Devils Backbone"" an entertaining ghost yarn from Mexican director Guillermo Del Toro (""Mimic""). Throw in intergenerational sex a stash of gold ingots and a few jars of deformed fetuses and youve got the makings of an exotic brew. Young Carlos (Fernando Tielve) is the hero a bookish lad sent to an isolated desert orphanage where he meets a bully (Inigo Garces) an evil caretaker (Eduardo Noriega) and the embittered one-legged widow (Marisa Paredes) of a leftist poet. This material is actually subdued for Del Toro who also made ""Cronos"" but its wicked fun nonetheless. Being a receptive child Carlos hears and sees the ravaged lonely ghost thats taken up residence in the orphanage basement. Through pluck and purity of thought he triumphs over the nasty caretaker and brings out a greater humanity in the one-legged widow and a kindly old science professor (Federico Luppi). Del Toro creates tension with taut pacing and a spooky soundtrack reminiscent of David Lynch that mixes gurgling a ghouls cries and the screech of mechanical gears. He has fun with the widows prosthetic leg and takes us into the professors lab where fetuses swim in a ""limbo water"" solution of spices and rum. ""I sell it in town"" the professor says of the solution ""and the money keeps the school going."" Partly a childs empowerment fantasy partly an allegory about war and justice ""The Devils Backbone"" allows Del Toro to combine horror idioms with his own brand of gothic humor. The film doesnt explore the nature of ghosts as it promises to initially but its fun to watch Del Toro confront death and fear with such energy and humor. Advisory This film contains violence raw language and sexual situations. -- Edward Guthmann JIMMY NEUTRON BOY GENIUS Animation. Starring the voices of Debi Derryberry Rob Paulsen and Patrick Stewart. Directed by John A. Davis. (G. 85 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius"" is an inventive and intermittently amusing animated movie about a boy genius who without trying manages to get every adult in his neighborhood abducted by space aliens. The picture avoids a pitfall common to modern animated films It doesnt cast enormously famous actors in the lead roles and permit them to infect the soundtrack with a torrent of shrill unfunny shtick designed to showcase their personalities at the expense of the story. ""Jimmy Neutron"" plays it fairly straight casting talented voice-over artists in the lead roles -- Debi Derryberry as Jimmy and Rob Paulsen as his best friend Carl -- and using Patrick Stewart Martin Short and comedian Andrea Martin for much smaller character parts. In the first scene of the movie Jimmy launches a space probe which attracts the attention of a malevolent race of egglike creatures from a distant galaxy who like to eat human beings. Most of the movie is about what Jimmy and his friends do to rescue their parents in the aftermath of the alien abduction. The jokes clearly scripted -- not improvised -- are often clever and the soundtrack made up in large part of New Wave classics -- the Ramones ""Blitzkrieg Bop"" the Go-Gos ""We Got the Beat"" and a cover of Kim Wildes ""Kids in America"" -- is unexpected and welcome. The movies main flaw a common one among animated features is that it takes an hour and a half to do in an ultimately tiresome way what it might have done brilliantly in 30 minutes. ""Jimmy Neutron"" just doesnt have enough power to sustain itself to feature length though children -- the movies real audience -- may be so dazzled by the spectacle of Jimmy flying through space with his robot dog that they wont notice. -- Mick LaSalle JOE SOMEBODY Comedy. Starring Tim Allen James Belushi. Directed by John Pasquin. (PG. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Boy does Tim Allen take some beatings in ""Joe Somebody."" First hes smacked by an office bully then by a groin-seeking missile of a squash ball and then in scenes of agonizing repetition for both Allens character and the audience by his beery self-defense instructor (James Belushi). These cheap shots account for a few cheap laughs in a movie that really has more serious concerns. ""Joe Somebody"" is an odd picture a rumination on depression and self-discovery thats couched as an office comedy. While never truly funny or insightful the movie works intermittently by digging a little deeper than you might expect. Allen whos always had a bit of the sad clown about him evokes sympathy as a middle-aged guy jolted into action after a life of quiet desperation. He plays Joe Scheffer a recent divorce and devoted dad with little to show for his years of service to a pharmaceutical company besides a spot in the parking lot. When the office creep -- played by the wonderfully impassive Patrick Warburton from ""Seinfeld"" -- invades that space Joe challenges him. The bully responds by slapping Joe around in front of his daughter and co- workers. The humiliation sends Joe into a tailspin. Director John Pasquin (""The Santa Clause"") uses a cinematic cheat sheet of stubble beer cans and pizza boxes to depict Joes breakdown but Allen gives the scenes emotional weight. His slack face and downcast eyes show the guys slumped spirit. To get out of his funk Joe sets up a rematch with the bully a move that wins him new friends at work. He also starts dressing better and slicking back his hair. Though these improvements are obviously ephemeral seeing Allen puff with newfound pride has an irresistible underdog tug. Belushi gets some fun moments as a washed-up Steven Seagal-like action hero whos been reduced to training regular jerks like Joe. He tells Joe he read about the parking-lot scuffle in ""The News of the Wuss"" a line thats dumb enough and delivered well enough to draw one of the pictures few genuine laughs. But their ""Karate Kid"" bits soon become tiresome and flat. Pathos and humor can be combined effectively but the humor has to be more incisive than a guy getting kicked in the privates. Advisory This film contains raw language violence. -- Carla Meyer HOW HIGH Comedy. Starring Method Man and Redman. Directed by Jesse Dylan. (R. At Bay Area theaters. 96 minutes.) ""How High"" doesnt look like a movie somebody made. It looks like a movie somebody hallucinated and put up on the screen. It is a complete goof-off apparently in the making and certainly in the viewing. Along the way it nonetheless manages to prompt a couple of decent laughs and a bunch of half-decent ones too. I ask you who wouldnt laugh at the body of John Q. Adams dug up from his grave? Hip-hop artists Method Man (of the Wu-Tang Clan) and Redman play a couple of Staten Island stoners made Harvard material by some super grass. Make that supernatural grass because it comes from beyond the grave along with one of their old buddies who went up in smoke so to speak. Man and Redman proceed to turn the tables and educate Harvard. The zonked- out buddies come across a snooty black dean (Obba Babatunde) who looks down on them the gorgeous daughter (Essence Atkins) of the U.S. vice president (Jeffrey Jones) and someone called Baby Powder (Mike Epps) who goes around slapping people in the face with baby powder. Jones (""Amadeus"") isnt the only reasonably well-known face who seems to wander into this picture almost by accident. Others include Fred Willard Hector Elizondo and Spalding Gray. It seems like a project that everybody involved went into with good faith and high spirits but about halfway through said ah the hell with it. Sex jokes gross-out jokes doper jokes snob jokes and the like all bounce off each other hit or miss until the movie abruptly stops. It doesnt end; it just stops. Who dealt this mess? Danny DeVito is one of the producers. Maybe it seemed like a good idea at the time. Advisory This film contains raw language pervasive drug use. -- Bob Graham  THE TURANDOT PROJECT  Documentary. Featuring Zubin Mehta and Zhang Yimou. Directed by Allan Miller. (Not rated. 84 minutes. In English Italian and Chinese with English subtitles. At the Lumiere.) In 1997 conductor Zubin Mehta and film director Zhang Yimou (""Raise the Red Lantern"") began collaborating on a production of Puccinis ""Turandot"" that was performed the next year in the Forbidden City of Beijing. Presumably theres an interesting yarn buried in the project but Allan Millers drab diffuse documentary never quite locates it. Instead Miller -- who made the Oscar-winning documentaries ""Bolero"" and ""From Mao to Mozart"" -- pieces together plenty of footage without conveying what the story is meant to be. Is it about Mehtas foolish quest to produce an ""authentic"" (i.e. Chinese) version of ""Turandot""? Or Zhangs nervous efforts to stage a difficult production in a genre about which he clearly knows very little? At times ""The Turandot Project"" plays like the most generic of backstage reportage. We see a rainstorm delay the final rehearsal the stagehands muff their cues seamstresses sew the incredibly opulent costumes and a soprano (Sharon Sweet) throw a mild diva fit over some headgear shes supposed to wear. These things arent uninteresting -- watching an opera production take shape always has a certain fascination -- but the narrative is shapeless and ungainly. Miller does throw in a few delicious touches particularly a sly glimpse of the Chinese soldiers who serve as supers proving unable to heed their superiors command to ""pay no attention to the ballet girls."" The most exciting drama though comes from Guido Levi the articulate truculent and charming lighting designer who goes head to head with Zhang (though not eye to eye -- the two squabble through an interpreter without ever looking at each other). More of him and less of the American singers shopping for food in Beijings markets wouldve helped this movie enormously. -- Joshua Kosman Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 4 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 5 Dear Abby I dont want anyone to know that Ive retired 6 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 7 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 8 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F. 9 Bikini-clad Swedish cop makes arrest while sunbathing 10 San Francisco ranks surprisingly low on the list of 20 Most...

"USATODAY.com - Enjoy Jimmy with popcorn and a Burp Cola Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 12/20/2001 - Updated 0358 PM ET Enjoy Jimmy with popcorn and a Burp Cola By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius (out of four) Voices By Debi Derryberry Patrick Stewart Martin Short Rob Paulsen Director John A. Davis Distributor Paramount Pictures Rating G Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius is bound to make parents happy if only because of its message ""Listen to your parents. They know whats good for you."" And it should please kids because for most of the animated feature Jimmy and his pals dont heed that advice have loads of fun and get into all manner of intergalactic mayhem. After Monsters Inc. this movie may be a bit of a letdown but there are some scenes that will delight elementary-school-age children and older preschoolers -- notably the gross-out moments. Jimmy concocts a ""Burp Cola"" that promises a belch with every sip. His parents innocently drink it providing the startling sounds of a dainty mother and straight-arrow father burping thunderously. ""At least its coming out of the attic and not the basement"" proclaims Pop which drew one of the biggest laughs from a screening audience. The story is a simple one Jimmy and his pals are dying to go to the towns new theme park Retroland on opening night but their parents forbid them because its a school night. (""What good is it to be a genius if you cant even go out on a school night?"" Jimmy says.) The boys sneak out and have a great time on all of the attractions but return to find their parents gone. On each refrigerator door is tacked a note ""Dear Son/Daughter Weve gone to Florida on an extended vacation. Love your parents."" Turns out all the adults were abducted by aliens and its Jimmys fault. In his science experiments he tries to communicate with outer space (to forge ""brotherhood among species""). Unbeknownst to him he makes contact with some man-eating monstrous spacemen. Jimmy and his pals must rescue their brainwashed parents on a remote planet and bring them home. The kids have a rip-roaring time misbehaving but then they act heroically learn a lesson and find themselves empowered from the experience. Jimmy also spouts his mea culpas to his mom and dad ""I should have listened when you said not to talk to strangers. I didnt think I needed you. But I do."" Would that everything were that simple in real life for kids and their parents these days.

Lander Andrea Martin Martin Short Patrick Stewart; Director John A. Davis; Author John A. Davis; Release Date Wide 12/21/2001; Runtime (in minutes) 84; MPAA Rating G; Distributor Paramount Pictures Posted January 4 2002 -- 1200 AM EST Theres a galaxy of difference between old-fashioned clever and information-age clever. Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius is a lickety-split madly packed roller-coaster entertainment that might almost have been designed to make you scared of how much smarter your kids are than you. In this digital-animated gizmo Jimmy the outrageously matter-of-fact young brainiac seems to have crammed all the knowledge in the world into his genial oversize Ace Ventura-coiffed head. Jimmy is a new kind of cool-geek wizard and the shiny-as-a-bubble Jimmy Neutron is packed with more nimble and ingenious gags than all two and a half hours of Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone. Jimmy when he isnt inventing atomic domestic gadgets foils an attack by squishy green aliens who live in clear synthetic eggs; its Peter Pan meets Men in Black.

But the present is also the past in this inventive film based on the Nickelodeon character. Jimmys hometown of Retroville USA is a candy-colored amalgamation of erroneous 1950s futurism and modern-day technology. In Retroville personal computers look like they were manufactured by a Philco TV factory and the local amusement park features thrill rides that combine the best aspects of rocket science and good old-fashioned vomit-inducing dizziness. Even Jimmys swooping haircut looks like a simultaneous nod to Howdy Doody and polymer-based industrial design. Jimmy is just a normal kid albeit one whos built his own robotic dog a toaster-satellite and a device that sucks the ""school smell"" from his clothing when he gets home in the afternoon. His parents take his Einstein-level I.Q. in relative stride (no pun intended). Though life around the Neutron household is often punctuated by explosions and Jimmys rocket crash-landing on the roof Mom only puts her foot down when dim-witted Dad is too awed to step in.
