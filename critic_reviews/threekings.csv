Comments Three Kings Recommended Rated R  114 minutes Four characters seeking personal gain are nearly sidetracked by altruistic impulses in this emotionally and politically responsible movie set in Iraq during the immediate aftermath of the gulf war--a damning yet idealistic satire about the motives behind U.S. foreign policy. The visuals are wild the sound track has the audacity to underscore the subtext instead of just echoing the obvious the comedy is irreverent and occasionally slapstick and the metaphorical details are consistently strong. The movie even examines the conventions of star-studded actioners without stripping the leads of the charisma and apparent immortality of full-blown action heroes. Writer-director David O. Russell (Spanking the Monkey Flirting With Disaster) has achieved it all hes made a movie (1999) thats about filmmaking--and things that really matter. With George Clooney Mark Wahlberg Ice Cube and Spike Jonze.

Russell; MPAA Rating R Posted October 1 1999 -- 1200 AM EDT When one of the heroes of director David O. Russells Three Kings a young Army sergeant named Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg) gets thrown into a makeshift prison he spies a box full of cellular phones finds one that works and calls his wife - who immediately picks up from her kitchen back in the States. The funny thing is you absolutely believe that he could make that call. ""Three Kings"" isnt a comedy exactly but it has a hipsters detachment one thats meant to mirror the jadedness of contemporary soldiers who are insulated from the very combat for which theyve been trained. In Iraq just after the U.S. victory in Operation Desert Storm Barlow and two other Americans Staff Sergeant Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) and Private Conrad Vig (Spike Jonze) stumble upon a map revealing a stash of Kuwaiti gold bullion that has been stolen by Saddam Husseins thugs. (They find the map sticking out of a wounded soldiers butt.) The Americans may have beaten back Saddam but they know that it was a triumph of technology more than valor. Theyre high-concept winners in a war fought - and broadcast - mostly on video screens and so they dont feel quite victorious; they feel restless. Under the command of Special Forces Captain Archie Gates (George Clooney) the films cynical/noble Humphrey Bogart figure they decide to go in and swipe the gold for themselves. The plan of course blows up in their faces creating an ironic surrogate for a battle they barely got to fight. ""Three Kings"" takes a comfortable proletarian view of Desert Storm. It salutes the soldiers on both sides of the conflict and tweaks President Bush for failing to sustain the U.S. commitment to the Iraqi rebels. On some level thats an unassailable stance but Id have appreciated it more if it didnt issue from a movie that took such a disreputable boys-club delight in images of trucks careering madly over land mines or a bomb being tossed like a football. ""Three Kings"" is so overstuffed with random fireworks that despite its politics its easy to imagine the film getting a four-star rave from Bush or Saddam.

Directed by David O. Russell. (R. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Hollywood makes wonderful anti-war movies seven or eight years after every war -- never during one when it might do some good. Maybe it takes that long for people to admit that the enemy was human that the soldiers on the other side werent really the enemy after all. It was beginning to look as though the Persian Gulf War might go ignored but now theres ""Three Kings."" Its George Clooneys best showcase to date -- a picture that is as strong as the war itself was dubious and one-sided. The films political point of view is open to debate. Some will come away feeling that America had no business there; others that the war should have continued and toppled Saddam Hussein. But there is no questioning the films humanity. In the modern world the truth is best conveyed through a combination of tragedy and farce. So we get the wonderful opening scene which sets the tone Mark Wahlberg an Army sergeant is in the desert when he notices an Iraqi soldier standing on a hill. The camera doesnt zoom in to let us know what the soldier is doing up there. We like Wahlberg can only guess. The soldier may be trying to surrender. The moment is unheroic and absurd even faintly ridiculous. Wahlberg sees that the Iraqi has a gun; he panics and shoots him then runs over to see this poor gasping guy. This sight hangs over the first half hour of ""Three Kings"" like poison gas. As Sgt. Barlow Wahlberg isnt a bad fellow. In fact hes sweet-natured. But sometimes circumstances are so confounded that everybody winds up dirty. When next we see him and his friends partying over the end of the war we remember the dying Iraqi and cant help seeing the Americans as the Iraqis might as a pack of feral ignoramuses. ""Three Kings"" is a tough movie. It was written and directed by David O. Russell whose last film was the comedy ""Flirting With Disaster."" Going from a chamber comedy to a movie of this scale is like going from painting miniatures to murals but Russell maintains his command of detail. Its March 1991 in Iraq. The war is over and career Capt. Archie Gates (Clooney) is wondering ""What did we do here?"" He is cynical about the military and doesnt look forward to civilian life. When a map falls into his hands showing where Hussein has stashed Kuwaiti gold he sees his chance. With three other soldiers -- a staff sergeant (Ice Cube) a hapless private (Spike Jonze) and Barlow (Wahlberg) -- he sets out to find the treasure. He expects it to take no more than an afternoon. Two movies ago Clooney was an insecure leading man who could not stop nodding his head. Now he has weight and gravity. When he tells the private about getting courage we believe that he has come by this knowledge through experience. He also makes us believe that his character has a conscience Finding the gold is easy; standing by while Iraqi soldiers put down a civilian uprising is impossible. He cant walk away and let innocent people get slaughtered. Its not an option. The cynical Gates discovers himself by finding something bigger than self-interest. From there life gets complicated for the American adventurers -- dangerous too. When violence breaks out in ""Three Kings"" its never easy. Russell films gun battles in slow motion so the effect of every bullet is felt. He even shows the damage a bullet does as seen from inside the body. There are no villains. Russell puts truths in the mouths of minor characters and even makes an Iraqi torturer somewhat sympathetic. The Iraqi explains that his 3-year-old son was killed by an American bomb and rants that Michael Jacksons plastic surgery is evidence of American racism and perversity. At the same time Russell uses humor to undercut tension and emphasize the human element. At one point Barlow in the midst of shots and explosions calls his wife on a cell phone. ""Hi Gooney Bird"" he says. ""Three Kings"" could have been a wise-guy adventure story. Instead it is -- and is likely to remain -- the definitive film about the Persian Gulf War. ..

Russells very individualistic first studio pic discharges black humor startling action genre subversion anarchic attitude and barbed political commentary on its way to making very cogent points about the cynically expedient nature of war and Americas role as the worlds policeman. Bold approach and surprising narrative could work both for and against it. Just the second Hollywood feature after ""Courage Under Fire"" to take on the 1991 Gulf War ""Three Kings"" does so in an impudently comic stylistically aggressive and finally very thoughtful manner. Using a ""Kellys Heroes""-like heist of enemy loot as a point of departure David O. Russells very individualistic first studio picture discharges black humor startling action genre subversion anarchic attitude and barbed political commentary on its way to making very cogent points about the cynically expedient nature of war and specifically Americas role as the worlds policeman. The films bold approach and surprising narrative could work both for and against it; on the one hand it is hard to imagine any audience finding it dull or uninteresting but on the other its contrariness in virtually all matters could very well exclude the mainstream action crowd and limit its appeal to relatively sophisticated news-savvy viewers. Undertaking one of the only American takes on 90s armed conflict (any number of Euro productions have examined the Yugoslavian mess) Russell evidently felt compelled or liberated to fashion a new-look war film appropriate to an era in which the publics images of warfare are defined by inelegant CNN pictures of nocturnal explosions and the resultant destruction. Certainly nothing else explains the deliberately grainy bleached-out almost digital look of this widescreen adventure in which any sense of heroism is canceled military grandeur is neutered and desert beauty is not allowed. Right off the bat another fresh element is introduced that of a victory being celebrated by volunteer soldiers who never really tasted combat. In a cacophonous sequence set in Iraqi territory in March 1991 a typically boisterous bunch of American soldiers horses around and illicitly boozes in the wake of kicking Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait and a cease-fire being declared. Special Forces Captain Archie Gates (George Clooney) a seen-it-all career officer due to retire in two weeks ditches his assignment to assist arrogant TV journalist Adriana Cruz (Nora Dunn) when he discovers that three G.I.s -Army Sergeant Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg) Staff Sergeant Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) and Private Conrad Vig (Spike Jonze) -- have in their hands a map that seems to identify the location of an enormous stash of gold bullion snatched from Kuwait by Saddams army. A man for whom ""necessity"" is the driving force behind human activity Gates has no trouble overcoming the younger mens moral scruples about theft merely by mentioning the identity of the man who stole it first and how it can enhance their post-war lives. A master of having his way within the military Gates commandeers a Humvee and leads his new cohorts on a brief excursion to a nearby desert village to take possession of the bullion. But the four men encounter a confusing situation at their destination. Welcomed with open arms by the Iraqi civilians who have been encouraged by President Bush to believe that their efforts to overthrow Saddam will receive U.S. support the soldiers treat them brusquely in their single-minded quest to grab the gold bricks. In the event the Americans need the locals help in loading the bullion and when Iraqi soldiers intervene they ignore the Yanks and concentrate on the native ""rebels"" opposed to the dictator. When the Iraqi soldiers in a tense confrontation kill a mother before her young daughters eyes and appear poised to create considerably more mayhem once the Yanks leave Gates and devout Christian Elgin have crises of conscience and quickly respond to the threat in a morally appropriate way. Shootout triggers the flight of the Americans and dozens of Iraqis. Deliberately confusing sequence accentuates one of the pics overriding themes of the temporary ambiguous and sometimes arbitrary nature of borders alliances and the rules of warfare. Gates sudden conversion to humanitarian over self-preservation reps one of the pictures few weak points; scriptwise there is no emotional or intellectual preparation for this and Clooney provides no clues in his performance of what might have led to this significant change of heart. But onward he goes accompanying the villagers to an underground rebel sanctuary while coping with the triple challenge of conducting the natives to safety holding onto the gold and avoiding a court-martial for going AWOL. For a good stretch much of Russells humor veers toward the glib and cynical and no opportunity is missed to make tiresome fun of the dumb Southern hick private played by Jonze (director of the forthcoming ""Being John Malkovich"" making a less than overwhelming bigscreen acting debut). And while the bleached-out visual style implemented by cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel (""The Usual Suspects"") is undeniably striking its affected grubbiness begins wearing thin well before the adventure comes to its properly ironic and pragmatic end. But the way the film develops and fills out its agenda by the final reels is genuinely impressive. Russell generally makes his points quickly and unpretentiously with stiletto-like jabs and some of them relating to infantry ennui and Bushs empty promises are familiar. More subtly he refers to how the CIA trained Iraqis during their war with Iran only to see that expertise turned against the U.S. a few years later and even peppers the English of such Iraqis with distinctly 70s and 80s phrases. Underlying it all however are sentiments that may go over the heads of general audiences those concerning the amorality and lack of consistent principles in American foreign policy. No Hollywood film in memory has addressed such an issue but the sobering final impression here is that unless the worlds most powerful country defines what it stands for it will stand for nothing other than the threat of brute force and economic coercion. Clooney Cube and particularly Wahlberg deliver rugged and well-considered turns and Dunn has some strong moments as the pushy journo. Carter Burwells score mixes seamlessly with a vast selection of tunes for an appropriately eclectic soundtrack.
