The good news there are many twists turns subplots and surprises that the coming attractions dont even hint at. The bad news these twists and turns are so preposterous or so irrelevant that they undermine the movie theyre meant to tart up.The title character played by Costner is a pillar of the Portland Ore. community a happily married husband and father who has an unfortunate addiction to murder. He even goes to AA meetings to deal with his problem though hes understandably reticent about sharing. His only confidant is--himself Mr. Brooks has a devilish alter ego who goads him on in his life of crime and this evil id-dude is played very cannily by William Hurt. As the bickering sides of Mr. Brookss twisted psyche Costner and Hurt have a delicious chemistry but it doesnt bode well for a movie when the only two compelling characters are the same person talking to himself.Their testy complicitous bond is far more interesting than Mr. Brookss relationship with his wife (Marg Helgenberger) his troubled daughter (Danielle Panabaker) who has abruptly dropped out of college the driven cop (Demi Moore) who is hot on his trail or the amateur photographer (Dane Cook) who happened to catch on film Mr. Brookss latest killing--a couple in the act of making love. Its not giving too much away to reveal that this creepy fellow is no conventional blackmailer; instead of money he wants the chance to accompany Mr. Brooks on his next killing. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week This sicko is barely credible (an actor more experienced than Cook might have helped) but Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideons script has far more rank improbabilities ahead the most egregious involving Mr. Brookss lovely daughter. As if there werent enough to hold our interest they give us an escaped convict pursuing Moore for sending him up the river. (These scenes seem to have been borrowed from another movie entirely.) Did I mention that Moores cop character is also a millionaire? Dont ask.For its first half ""Mr. Brooks"" directed by Evans is pretty engaging trash. Costner is usually most fun when hes subverting his nice-guy persona (""No Way Out"") and here he gets to play both a paragon and a villain. The basic premise has real potential think what Claude Chabrol could do with it. But Evans and Gideon arent seriously interested in the psychology of their characters. Theyre so worried about holding our attention they overload their tale with bombshells byways and bogus suspense. The movie becomes a crazy quilt of competing stories none of them properly developed. You could cut half the major characters out of ""Mr. Brooks"" and never miss them.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

By David Denby Kevin Costner and Demi Moore in a surprising new thriller.   Credit TOM BACHTELL Alfred Hitchcock used to complain about moviegoers who refused to yield to the pleasures of narrative. ""The plausibles"" he called them--viewers who rather than enjoying one of his stories about two ordinary people caught up in some sort of sinister affair would nag at minor details or ask ""Why dont they call the cops?"" To narrative filmmakers the plausibles ask the wrong questions and make the wrong demands. They should care not whether a thriller is absolutely consistent but whether it gives good nasty jolts. ""Mr. Brooks"" a new thriller starring Kevin Costner is a challenge to the literal-minded. A local celebrity in Portland Oregon a self-made millionaire with a loving wife and daughter Earl Brooks has a secret life he is addicted to murder. Every now and then over a period of several years with excruciating guilt as well as considerable enjoyment he has gone out at night and committed a perfect crime. He has a superb enabler--an alter ego (William Hurt) whom he calls for some reason Marshall and who accompanies him everywhere. No one else of course can see Marshall and when Brooks converses with him people think that he is merely lost in thought. Marshall is Brookss desire his madness and his sanity too--the part of him that wants to kill people and also calculates how to avoid getting caught. Think of him as ego and superego rolled into one hyperarticulate pest. The movie which was written by Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon and directed by Evans is so well made and so compelling as a portrait of a man at war with himself that right up until the end many people will probably be entertained by its intricately preposterous story. Perhaps the most surprising element is that the onscreen alter ego--normally a tiresome device--turns out to be a big part of the fun. Kevin Costner who is famously talented at playing athletes but often stiff even monotonous and smug when playing other roles gives his best performance in years. As Brooks he is formidable and distant at work relaxed and authoritative at home and sardonic and almost viciously funny on his late-night jaunts. Costner seems to be exploring aspects of himself that hes never put on the screen before. His Mr. Brooks is a smart guy whos good at reading situations and figuring out what other people want--a businessmans skills which the movie in a mildly subversive turn suggests might also make for a good murderer. Costner was obviously attracted to the expansive possibilities in the script; after reading it he agreed to co-produce the movie. And he also loosened up I would guess because he got to play opposite William Hurt now the most brilliant character actor in American movies. Marshall pleading with his host to commit murder is a roguish wit seductive and amused who knows that hes being unreasonable but presses his needs anyway. Once satisfied he becomes the ultimate kibbitzer--he doesnt have to do anything but give advice and render judgment on Brookss criminal panache. Hurt tucking in his jaw and alternating irony sarcasm and mockery hits one spinning serve after another and Costner hits them right back at him. The two have a fine time as if they had been doing this routine for years. Brooks has a peculiar adversary--a voyeur with satanic eyebrows (the comic Dane Cook) who photographed him killing a naked young couple. He blackmails Brooks but he doesnt want money. He wants to be taken along on Brookss next night out; hes an aspiring murder junkie. Brooks has an even more formidable foe--a tough homicide detective named Tracy Atwood played by Demi Moore in full battle mode as a woman fighting not only crime but a parasitical husband. Speaking of her character Moore has said ""The rage Atwood has is something that I personally dont like"" which is odd since in so many of her movies rage is the main thing she has going for her. Moore is easier to watch when her roles (including Atwood) allow her to use explicitly what some people find intolerable about her--her desire to overdefine any given situation so that she can control it. The screenplay adds a third wild card Brookss beloved college-age daughter (Danielle Panabaker) who may have murderous tendencies of her own. Twenty years ago Evans and Gideon wrote the coming-of-age drama ""Stand by Me."" Like Earl Brooks they clearly have a talent for the dark side and this movie though it goes wrong at the end suggests that Evans as a director should give in to it. The rhythm of the picture switches between long silent sequences in which Brooks falls into a state of murderous abstraction and the elegant notation of physical movement--a hand entering a frame photographs burning in a kiln. Evans will never be Hitchcock but he produces enough pleasurable tension to send the plausibles into a frenzy of disapproval. In 1959 about the same time that Doris Day successfully defended her honor from Rock Hudsons assault in ""Pillow Talk"" an extremely pretty Bronx girl named Linda Riss fought off a married lawyer named Burt Pugach. He was thirty-two Linda ten years younger. Pugach wasnt much to look at and his honesty both personal and professional was intermittent at best but he had some money. He took Linda to ""a cabaret in New Rochelle"" and flew her around in his Piper Cub. Trying to account for Burts appeal Lindas friends in recent interviews cite his exalted status in the lower-middle-class Bronx. He had a Cadillac He had a plane At first Burt pursued Linda without telling her that he was married; he then produced a set of divorce papers a forgery exposed by Lindas mother. Through all this Linda resolving like Doris Day not to ""give it away"" held out for a marriage proposal. Despite many further endearments from Burt she agreed to marry a good-looking young man named Larry Schwartz whereupon Burt hired three thugs to throw lye in her face so that the young man would no longer want her. This barbaric act which left Linda nearly sightless wound up tying her and Burt together for life. The fascinating documentary ""Crazy Love"" directed by the filmmaker and public-relations executive Dan Klores is a real-world story as redolent of the time and place as Dion and the Belmonts in which possessiveness stupidity loyalty and need are joined together in bewildering combinations. Its as if some disreputable and unending liaison out of Greek mythology had arisen on the streets of the East Bronx to be celebrated not with poetry but with front-page headlines. Like ""Capturing the Friedmans"" Kloress movie uses media archeology to reveal the layers of untoward behavior beneath the responsible surface of American Jewish life. Klores incorporates still photographs home movies and stock footage feeding them into extensive current-day interviews with the two principals their friends and a local philosopher Jimmy Breslin who says ""Nobody is as visibly insane as Burt Pugach and still not institutionalized."" But Breslins judgment is not quite right. Klores and his editor David Zieff hold a few surprises in reserve one of which is that Burt is occasionally something more than a demented lowlife. Linda now seventy with a large pile of hair and dark glasses seems a tough and practical woman; Burt eighty with a Mephistophelian goatee comes off not as pathological but as exceptionally egotistical wily larcenous and guilty. His love for Linda redeems him and he knows it. One may be horrified by these two or laugh at them but both horror and laughter give way to amazement at the human talent for survival. You can build a ship--maybe a whole fleet--in a bottle but then what do you do with it? For Steven Soderberghs ""Oceans Thirteen"" an enormous Las Vegas casino--the centerpiece of a new mega-hotel The Bank named after its egomaniacal owner Willy Bank (Al Pacino)--was constructed on a Hollywood soundstage. This movie is certainly more hardworking than ""Oceans Twelve"" in which Danny Rusty and the boys lounging at George Clooneys villa on Lake Como barely condescended to speak their lines between drinks. The script by Brian Koppelman and David Levien is a revenge plot Bank has swindled the gangs beloved mentor Reuben (Elliott Gould) so Danny and the others plan to louse up the opening of Banks hotel. Soderbergh assembles the elements of their complicated scheme--which involves magnetizing dice and creating an earthquake--into short punchy scenes and edits them together at top speed. But after a lot of buildup not much happens at the climax. The casino set hardly gets explored. Soderbergh ends the movie with a few jokes which is casual and neat but leaves you wondering whether the practice of making enormous movies about nothing isnt a little mad.

"Mr. Brooks Modern Dr. Jekyll | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesMr. Brooks Modern Dr. JekyllThe psychological suspense thriller is such a tired movie genre that recent efforts ( Premonition  Bug ) have resorted to weird mess-with-their-mind tactics that hardly leave viewers satisfied let alone scared.By Susan WalkerENTERTAINMENT REPORTERFri. June 1 2007 Starring Kevin Costner William Hurt and Demi Moore. Directed by Bruce Evans. Written by Evans and Raynold Gideon. 120 mins. At major theatres. 18A   Article Continued BelowThe psychological suspense thriller is such a tired movie genre that recent efforts (Premonition Bug) have resorted to weird mess-with-their-mind tactics that hardly leave viewers satisfied let alone scared.Writers Bruce Evans and Raynold Gideon opted for a traditional story approach in Mr. Brooks but largely eschewed the standard thriller elements and found their hook in some unusual characters.Kevin Costner is Earl Brooks in a role were inclined to buy which is more than one can say for his recent efforts (Rumor Has It Dragonfly). Hes two kinds of psychopath the split personality and the thrill-seeking serial killer.Mr. Brooks as Dr. Jekyll is a prominent multi-millionaire who owns a box manufacturing company. Hes being toasted as Man of the Year when an old urge overtakes him.In a nice visual irony Brooks and his wife live in a beautiful glass house. But hes anything but transparent in his huge obsession. He likes to kill people. He loves the act the death and the results. He takes pictures and he leaves his mark; the victims bloody thumbprint. Demi Moore in one of her best turns since Disclosure is Det. Tracy Atwood. Shes obsessed with catching the Thumbprint Killer. It has been two years since hes struck when police come upon a couple who died in flagrante delicto their bodies neatly posed for the post-mortem photo shoot. But as Brooks Mr. Hyde - William Hurt embodying the demon desire to kill - points out hes made a mistake that could lead to his capture. Hurt is believably creepy as he nags Brooks muttering in his ear from the backseat of the Volvo Brooks takes on his murderous joyrides.The Brooks a loving couple also have a daughter Jane away at university. Danielle Panabaker plays this daddys girl and its a while before we see where her story is going. Tracy the detective has an untold story as well in that shes being sued for millions by an ex-husband. And how could a cop be so rich? Stand-up comic Dane Cook ""Mr. Smith"" adds another wrinkle as a peeping Tom whod like to take his bad habits to the next level. There is a lot to keep track of in this impeccably filmed movie and the tracking is well rewarded. In many of his worst movies Costners trademark is a cheesy moment that brings an unwanted guffaw. This one has two one of them being Costner in a laughably bad disguise.Quite a few plot lines and character quandaries remain unresolved. And yet the movie makes sense as it stands. After all one can never know what makes a psychopath tick.

William Hurt made him do it By Moira Macdonald       Seattle Times movie critic PREV of NEXT ELEMENT FILMS          William Hurt rear is Kevin Costners alter ego in ""Mr. Brooks"" about a high- society gentleman who just happens to be a serial killer. Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Mr. Brooks"" with Kevin Costner Demi Moore Dane Cook William Hurt. Directed by Bruce A. Evans from a screenplay by Evans and Raynold Gideon. 120 minutes. Rated R for strong bloody violence some graphic sexual content nudity and language. Theres a weirdly inspired idea at the center of Bruce A. Evans odd thriller ""Mr. Brooks"" William Hurt as Kevin Costners alter ego. Think about it two of cinemas dukes of deadpan sharing a body and flatly intoning questions to each other. Its oddly effective; though they dont look much alike you can absolutely picture them separated at birth or sharing a speech teacher who specialized in monotone. Its a giggly concept but theres little thats funny about ""Mr. Brooks"" which has a very dark plotline indeed. Costner plays the title character an absurdly wealthy fellow with a successful business a loving family and two absorbing hobbies pottery and murder. Mr. B has a staggeringly lavish ceramics studio behind his house to which he often retreats late at night telling his wife (Marg Helgenberger) that hes going out there to ""try out different glazes"" which certainly sounds like a euphemism for something nasty. And he has an invisible friend named Marshall (Hurt) who whispers terrible things in his ear egging him on in his second career as a serial killer of some renown; hes known to the press as the Thumbprint Killer. Marshall keeps turning up in the dark or in Brooks rearview mirror drawling invitations to murder and praising Brooks as he methodically cleans his car and burns his clothing after slaughtering a couple in their bed. The story becomes further complicated by a detective (Demi Moore) determined to track down Thumbprints identity; a victims neighbor (Dane Cook) with some strange voyeuristic tendencies of his own; and Brooks daughter (Danielle Panabaker) a surly mouthed teen whose actions demonstrate chillingly that this apple didnt fall very far from the tree. Set in Portland (though mostly filmed in Louisiana) ""Mr. Brooks"" has a sleek elegance to it; its interiors hum quietly with money at odds with its sometimes frenetic story. Its ultimately a strange showcase for Costner whose relaxed demeanor better suits breezy comedy. (Who would want to believe that ""Bull Durhams"" Crash Davis was a murderer?) Though its certainly more genuinely creepy than many recent thrillers and the supporting cast (particularly Cook) is effective ""Mr. Brooks"" is never quite as delicious as its central pairing. In their dark suits and tasteful haircuts Costner and Hurt murmur to each other like an extremely subdued vaudeville act; you sense that if called upon they could sing in perfect unison. Maybe next time.

First of all this is the first version of the Jekyll and Hyde story in which the solid citizen and his evil alter ego are two close friends played by two separate charismatic actors. Of course I have used the term ""solid citizen"" to describe Kevin Costners Mr. Brooks more aptly than Robert Louis Stevensons original Dr. Jekyll who produced Mr. Hyde out of his test tubes. It is never explained how Mr. Brooks produced William Hurts Hyde equivalent Marshall a comparatively companionable alter ego with whom Mr. Brooks shares many a hearty laugh over the sheer humor inherent in the quest for murder victims. In fact Mr. Brooks seems much closer to Marshall than to his own beautiful wife Marg Helgenbergers Emma Brooks who spends most of her screen time either sleeping alone in her bed or tending to their problem-plagued teenage daughter Jane (Danielle Panabaker). Indeed Ms. Helgenberger has much more to do any evening on the crime series CSI than she does here. By contrast Ms. Panabakers Jane gets a jolting twist scene of her own. But the major female diversion in this mostly all-male spectacle is Demi Moores Tracy Atwood a detective on the trail of a serial killer though her character gets repeatedly sidetracked from the trail of Mr. Brooks by several plot convolutions that leave her modestly triumphant but still befuddled. The final major character in the melodrama is provided by Dane Cooks Mr. Smith a shady character and professional voyeur who witnesses a Brooks murder and photographs it. But instead of using it to blackmail Brooks or turning it over to the police he decides to use it as a bizarre incentive for Brooks to take Smith along on his next murder for the sheer turn-on of the spectacle. Brooks and Marshall are especially jovial as they discuss what to do with and about Mr. Smith. The Brooks-Marshall relationship becomes a bit strained at this point because Mr. Brooks seems to be getting sick to his stomach over his addiction particularly since he begins suspecting that Jane has inherited his genes and furthermore she is already under suspicion by the police for a murder at her school. The point is that Mr. Brooks is one of the most successfully and most outrageously sick and immoral movies I have ever seen. I suppose it is to its credit that it is as seductive as all get out so that as much as you want to hate it you end up being reluctantly charmed by its finesse. In some ways Mr. Brooks may be the ideal entertainment for a period when so many people believe so many other people should be killed as efficiently as possible and Mr. Brooks is nothing if not efficient.

Photo Courtesy Photo Mr. Brooks 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Vengeful Bible-thumper in one movie sandwich-making mamas boy in another the average cinematic serial killer is a poster boy for bad parenting. A clinging mother screwed up somewhere and badly. But in Mr. Brooks Bruce A. Evans fitfully subversive approach to the genre we get a few fresh takes on the psychology of serial killing. First we learn that sociopaths are born not made Their brains are hard-wired for it. A fellow can try like the dickens not to slay innocent strangers and rearrange them in meticulous erotic tableaux but boy it isnt easy. Unlike most other movies in the genre Mr. Brooks quotes the Serenity Prayer. Before we see him we hear the voice of the addict whispering his appeal for acceptance and wisdom. Next we get a look Earl Brooks Oregon box-factory owner and bespectacled stuffed shirt winning man of the year from the Portland Chamber of Commerce. Brooks is played by Kevin Costner with a well-modulated nerdiness that shuns the whiny narcissism of his early roles and confirms the aging process as a smart career move. He sags but it suits him Theres something vulnerable in this dry-cleaned butcher something we catch in his love for his daughter (Danielle Panabaker) and his supplicant nakedness as he incinerates the last bits of evidence from a murder. But the fun of Mr. Brooks isnt found in the killing although theres plenty of that. Its the delicious tete-a-tetes between the lead and his wisenheimer imaginary playmate Marshall an alter ego whose scornful form emerges from the shadows like a Cheshire cat. Marshall eggs him on to slaughter (""You deserve a treat"") in sneaky conversations that look to outside observers like Mr. Brooks spacing out. I cant imagine who besides William Hurt could pull this off with such zest -- maybe Kevin Spacey or Anthony Hopkins but theyre both redundant. Hurts an actor I always assumed was smarter than I and everyone else so its no great leap to imagine him as Costners sneering phantasmal puppet master. As for the rest of the movie the action and supporting characters and shocking revelations and all that stuff -- they serve their purpose. Mr. Brooks kills a sexy couple then attends an AA meeting in a fit of devout remorse. But a wheedling wannabe-killer (Dane Cook) snaps incriminating photos then uses them to blackmail Mr. Brooks into showing him the ropes. Meanwhile a cop on the chase (Demi Moore) gets sidetracked by a messy divorce and an assault by a second serial killer an escaped convict (Matt Schulze) known as the Hangman. As you know there are good serial killers and there are bad serial killers and the Hangman -- hes not good. Especially not for the screenplay (co-written by Evans and Raynold Gideon the team behind 1992s Kuffs) which assumes Cirque du Soleil contortions just to connect the subplots. Not everything makes sense in the end including the end Evans makes a brilliant if not completely sick move toward narrative closure that he then negates infuriatingly in the final scene. But Evans and cinematographer John Lindley have great fun framing and lighting Costner and Hurts scenes together playing off the looking-glass motif in figurative ways (Marshall and Earl opposed in profile) and literal (Marshall in the rear-view). At one point they catch each others eye in the mirror and burst out laughing sharing a joke. Its a bright moment in a film that mines the dark mind of a killer. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals PS4 Games at Amazon from 10 + free shipping w/ Prime City Jogger Baby Strollers from 156 + free shipping Open-Box Wolfgang Puck 22L Pressure Oven for 70 + free shipping American Airlines Nationwide Fares from 38 1-way Powered by Contests Enter to win concert tickets airfare and hotel More Entertainment News Rolling Stones Lash Out at Donald Trump (Again) Over Song Use Daveed Diggs Renee Elise Goldsberry to Leave Hamilton Broken Social Scene Working on New Album Steve Young of M/A/R/R/S Pump Up the Volume Fame Dead Calvin Harris Taylor Swift Song Co-Write Questions We Still...

BY Jack Mathewsdaily News Movie Critic Friday June 1 2007 400 AM ""Mr. Brooks"" Thriller about an Oregon mogul who doubles as a serial killer. With Kevin Costner William Hurt Demi Moore. Director Bruce Evans (155).R Violence language sexuality/nudity. At area theaters. Watching Kevin Costner and William Hurt - as an Oregon businessman and his murderous alter ego - share grim laughs during Bruce Evans ""Mr. Brooks"" is one of the pleasures of this totally absurd and equally entertaining psychological thriller. Evans and his co-writer Raynold Gideon took a huge risk in splitting Costners Earl Brooks into two separate characters who carry on conversations that nobody else can hear while plotting murders and arguing about when and who to kill. But the risk pays off because once you adjust to the odd conceit - an easy thing to do because Costner and Hurt are terrific together - youre prepared to accept a story riddled with holes. When we join him Earl is collecting a Man of the Year award after which he leaves his unsuspecting wife in their glassed-in mansion and sneaks off with Marshall his exhilarated alter ego to pull off the double-murder of a pair of dancers theyve been stalking. Like father like daughter? Kevin Costner and Danielle Panabaker who plays his college-age offsrping in Mr. Brooks. Earl is the so-called ""Thumbprint Killer"" who has been rearranging the nude bodies of his victims and leaving bloody thumbprints behind. Whether those thumbprints will be his undoing is one of many potential red herrings tossed out by Evans. The immediate problem for Earl is that his latest thrill-kills have been photographed by the voyeur living next door and this guy (Dane Cook) is nuttier than Marshall. Instead of turning the photos over to homicide detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore) he uses them to blackmail Earl into letting him go along on his next killing. As Earl and Marshall ponder this predicament Atwoods investigation is bringing her closer to the blackmailer setting up a cat-and-mouse game between her and the killer at the same time. Throw in a subplot about Earls college-age daughter being a suspect in a campus murder (got the bad gene did she?) and youve got the unlikeliest thriller of the year. There are one or two subplots too many especially those meant to beef up Moores role. But Costner whos never been cooler and the always fascinating Hurt carry this trifle off beautifully.

BROOKS  Kevin Costner in MR. BROOKS Image 2 of 2  William Hurt and Kevin Costner in MR BROOKS  William Hurt and Kevin Costner in MR BROOKS Thats Mister homicidal maniac to you pal 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Mr. Brooks Crime thriller. Starring Kevin Costner Demi Moore and Dane Cook. Directed by Bruce A. Evans. (R. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The appeal of ""Mr. Brooks"" is as obvious as it is hard to resist Kevin Costner as a serial killer. The actor who has patterned himself after the strong-silent types of mid-century breaks new ground in this one going where Gary Cooper never went before. He takes on a modern urban thriller -- and as the bad guy no less. Except that its a Costner bad guy which means he has his reasons. In ""Mr. Brooks"" serial killing is likened to alcoholism or any other form of addiction. Brooks a wealthy entrepreneur is an otherwise reasonable man in the grip of something that is twisted into his very nature. He can stop sometimes for years at a time but he keeps relapsing. Writer-director Bruce A. Evans impishly presents Brooks struggle with himself through an ongoing conversation between Brooks and an invisible alter ego. This spirit of menace and mayhem is played by William Hurt who keeps whispering in his ear egging him on talking about how fun it will be. Partly by the casting of Costner and partly by the treatment of his compulsion the movie does a number of insidious things. It makes a heartless sociopath into a sympathetic figure. It persuades us to root for him to succeed and not get caught. And worst -- or best -- or most disturbing of all -- it takes his addiction and makes it almost understandable to us. In the movies first example of violence he kills two lovers in their bed and almost swoons from the sheer thrill of it -- inviting the audience to have the shame of empathizing with him. With all that going for it all Evans and co-writer Raynold Gideon have to do is not screw it up and they dont. They introduce a homicide cop on the case Demi Moore and its a pleasure to see Moore for the first time in years in a meaty role that isnt a kind of monster-parody of herself. The detective has been following Mr. Brooks exploits but hes meticulous in his work and has never left a clue. Until now. This time he neglected to close the curtains before he killed these people which leads a young creep to show up in his office with a batch of photos. The creep (Dane Cook) isnt interested in blackmail. He just wants to get off by accompanying Mr. Brooks on his next homicidal adventure. Thats just one plot strain. The movie introduces several juggling them expertly and making them all come together at the finish. The screenplay may be a bit programmatic a bit too neat a bit too much like craft and too little like inspiration but its a polished job and it entertains and Ill take it. Im happy. Danielle Panabaker has a nice role as Mr. Brooks daughter who may have inherited more from dad than just good looks. And Yasmine Delawari makes a surprisingly vivid impression in a modest role as Mr. Brooks secretary. But theres more to be said. The audience takes something from this picture. Maybe it was intended and maybe it wasnt. Perhaps ""Mr. Brooks"" simply caught the spirit of the era but in any case the film emerges as a subtle commentary on a disquieting aspect of our current culture -- a commentary on the nature of a masturbatory voyeurism and how it fosters heartlessness by turning other people into objects. When Mr. Brooks and the other perverse characters in the film are aroused they have to forget the humanity of others in order to achieve satisfaction. If they remember that other people are people theyll lose the impulse. The relevance of this message to the society at large and not just to the characters is obvious in that we live in a voyeuristic culture in which both entertainment and commerce trade on instant and impersonal arousal. I suspect that 50 or 60 years ago this film would have made absolutely no sense to people. But today we can see in the cold world of ""Mr. Brooks"" the coldness of our own world. And we can look at Mr. Brooks for minutes at a time and forget that hes a villain or simply not care. If this says something its not something good. -- Advisory This film contains sexual situations nudity strong language and graphic violence.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Is the world ready for a throwback serial killer? Mr. Brooks wields a semi-automatic a silencer and a crisp bow tie. He is the Niles Crane of serial killers all white gloves and well-covered tracks - hes been known to bring his own vacuum cleaner to crime scenes to corral the stray fiber. He speaks with the mannered courtesy and precise diction of a 1959 corporate chieftain in a training video The banquet menu was fine he tells his wife on a drive home ""but I did not care for the dessert. Would you like to stop for something sweet?"" He is man of the year literally raining charitable cash onto greater Portland Ore. from his captains chair at Brooks Box Factories. The posed dead bodies and splatter shots are simply a hobby a sensibility that if sustained by writer- director Bruce Evans and his screenplay partner Raynold Gideon would make for a fascinating and funny commentary on the darker side of American business life. And Kevin Costner does his best showing up as a seasoned pro as he always does for his film roles and as he has done successfully in a recently revived career that includes ""The Upside of Anger"" ""Open Range"" and ""The Guardian."" He looks good in a bow tie trim and facile and possesses both the gravity and the wit to pull off a more consistent script. Yet ""Mr. Brooks"" falters despite the presence of star power like Costner William Hurt as Mr. Brooks evil alter ego Demi Moore as a harried detective and comedian Dane Cook as a sinister voyeur. ""Mr. Brooks"" has more tonal shifts than a Philip Glass concert never deciding if its a thriller a noir a comedy or a farce. Nor does ""Mr. Brooks"" have a hero or anti-hero that would carry us through the high concept. Mr. Brooks appears to be a high-functioning schizophrenic arguing with a William Hurt no one else can see and trying to delay his next murder by going to addiction meetings at church. Is he a good guy? Do his victims ""deserve"" it? Is Demi Moore our hero as Detective Atwood who believes she is close to solving the real identity of Portlands longtime ""Thumbrint Killer""? If so shes fairly incompetent and out of control getting by on good hair and tailored pantsuits. Meanwhile a jerk is divorcing her and a felon she put away is stalking her - she doesnt have much time to change the bags in Mr. Brooks vacuum cleaner. Perhaps Dane Cook is supposed to be our true villain representing the salacious tastes of a society that will watch nearly any form of violence on TV or in the movies. He catches Mr. Brooks in the act one night through the lens of his amateur camera; instead of turning him in he demands to be taken along on the next murder so that he might watch and learn. This is the most intriguing nugget of ""Mr. Brooks"" and Cook is serviceable in the part. Yet with Mr. Brooks fighting other problems at home - pregnant college-age daughter who might have murdered a classmate () - and another baddie chasing Detective Atwood while Brooks constantly bickers with the devil on his shoulder the plot line never gets its due. You demand evidence of tonal changes? How about Costner squatting naked in front of a pottery kiln bleating out pleas to a stack of murder- scene photos hes taken ""Please forgive me please forgive me please forgive me."" Try to get that image out of your head. Almost as powerful as the bow tie isnt it? Moments later Mr. Brooks warns the leering amateur photographer with a wry smile ""If you become addicted to killing it could ruin your life."" Against ""Mr. Brooks"" I rest my case. There is plenty of style from conception to execution pretty people gliding through hallways of brushed steel and reflective glass. But for all this elegant killing only the audience is paying a high price.

"The murderer in the rear view mirror - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Events    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW The murderer in the rear view mirror William Hurt (left) plays Kevin Costners murderous inner demon whispering evil from the back seat. (Ben Glass) By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  June 1 2007 Mr. Brooks runs a successful box company in the Pacific Northwest. Hes solidly upper-middle-class has a wife a daughter  and a partiality to bow ties. Hes a pillar of the community. He likes to murder people.It isnt the most original idea for a movie -- the bland all-American face of evil -- but when that movie stars Kevin Costner as the serial killer you tend to sit up and take notice. ""Mr. Brooks"" is Cost- ners attempt to shake up his somnolent Marlboro-man image to go to the dark side and get audiences interested in him again and as long as its focused on his character (or characters; more on that below) its funny dirty thrilling stuff Grade-A pulp.But why be content with one plot when you can have several crashing into each other? ""Mr. Brooks"" is also a fertile example of the Studio Film Gone Berserk where too many characters and too many story lines geometrically progress until a level of blissful absurdity is reached. There are three movies crammed into this one The first is good the second is so bad its good and the third is just plain bad. Thats still three times the bargain most movies offer.The good movie stars Costner as Earl Brooks  who has kept the lid on his homicidal addiction for several years before the movie opens whereupon it starts calling to him again. Or rather he starts calling he being ""Marshall "" Brookss malevolent inner demon played by William Hurt with the glee of uncut Id. Marshall sits in the back seat whispering murder into the rearview mirror as Earl drives home from a banquet with his lovely wife (Marg Helgenberger ). Marshall is every awful thought youve tried to repress.The slaughter of random innocents that follows is a shocker brutal and fast very aware of the sexual charge Brooks gets from the act. Its in no way fun though at least for Earl who begs Marshall to set him free. It is enjoyable however for the sleazy little slacker (comedian Dane Cook ) who witnesses the killing and blackmails Brooks into letting him come along next time.A dark mentor/disciple relationship develops with Marshall urging bloody mayhem from the sidelines of the heros skull. ""Mr. Brooks"" is witty enough -- just -- to make the distinction between serial killers driven by inner compulsion and soulless modern kids bored by YouTube and looking for the next big kick.Meanwhile -- heres the so-bad-its-good story line -- police detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore ) is obsessively following Earls bloody trail while dealing with (a) the fallout of her divorce from a smarmy playboy (Jason Lewis ) (b) an escaped killer (Matt Schulze ) who wants revenge and (c) the burden of being an independently wealthy civil servant. Any one of these would suffice for its own movie but our Tracys a multitasker.Indeed Moore is so grimly purposeful that its hard not to get the giggles. The older she gets the more the actress reminds me of late-period Joan Crawford  same rigid face and bulldog ferocity same air of lunatic conviction. Whatever movie Moores in or thinks shes in shes the queen bee.The third plot thread involves Earls college-age daughter (Danielle Panabaker ) and I wont spoil it other than to say that it just doesnt work primarily because the filmmakers have their hands too full to develop it properly. No the reason youre here -- and you should be here if you have the proper reverence for clever genre sadism and slumming stars -- is the sanguine triangle between Earl Marshall and ""Mr. Smith"" as the blackmailer dubs himself.Costner and Hurt play together deliciously well. Theyre like the ""Sideways"" duo of introvert and extrovert sandwiched into one psychological ham-on-wry. (Cook freed of the burden of being the hot new thing graciously steps back and lets the old boys have their way.) A bit in which Earl and Marshall share a nasty laugh over Smiths naivete is so inspired that director Bruce A. Evans (who co-wrote the script with Raynold Gideon ) unnecessarily repeats it a few minutes later.Thats true of the movie as a whole Its never quite as smart as its central concept or performances. Evans keeps nudging Earl in the direction of a Hannibal Lecter -style omniscient genius -- whats with the scene where Mr. Brooks breezily hacks into Detective Atwoods tax records? Despite that nothings as simple or unnerving as the frustrated little moan Costner lets out when Earl burns the photos of his bloody nights work.That moan is the lament of a white-collar drone who knows his real worth will never be recognized. When its not completely flipping out ""Mr. Brooks"" says that work may be important but ultimately its secondary. Its our hobbies that define who we are.Ty Burr can be reached at tburr globe.com.

The hero is a slob the story is about what the title says its about and the movie goes about telling it in a style that is casually profane sexually explicit often coarse and occasionally crude. Should the film be seen then as just another sign of civilizations decline? Not for a moment. Judd Apatows high-density high-intensity comedy of bad (and good) manners is a cause for celebration -- the laugh lines are smart and they come faster than you can process them. For anyone concerned about the state of mainstream films this is also an occasion for some wonderment -- at Mr. Apatows gift for mating the crowd-pleasing raunchiness with a generous spirit genuine sweetness uncommon delicacy zestful social criticism and a moral dimension that provides substance and meaning without ever getting in the way. ENLARGE The premise is almost as simple as it seems. The slob hooks up at a bar with a gorgeous blonde whos there to celebrate a big promotion. A few weeks after their drunken encounter (which is much more plausible than it sounds) shes pregnant and hes dumbfounded. But the complications begin with a pair of beautifully nuanced performances -- Seth Rogen is Ben Katherine Heigl is Allison -- and they proceed from the characters essential selves. Allison may be behind her facade of professional accomplishment one more child about to have a child but having her child is a given; she never considers abortion as an option. (The birth scene is both stirring and shocking.) Ben may be behind his slob exterior a hapless boor and a quintessential slacker -- he and his goony buddies are trying in their cyberspace-cadet fashion to put together a soft-core Web site -- but hes also tender gentle and vulnerable an overgrown under socialized boy with a touching potential for commitment and growth. Two years ago Judd Apatow directed ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" a similarly raunchy and improbably affecting comedy that he co-wrote with Steve Carell. That film starred Mr. Carell in the title role of Andy a shy guy working in an electronics store while one of Andys co-workers Cal was played by Seth Rogen who helped inspire the idea for this film. Far from lithe and given to bleak expressions Mr. Rogen is an unlikely candidate for the post of matinee idol but then so was Dustin Hoffman in ""The Graduate."" And Katherine Heigl follows in the footsteps of great beauties like Michelle Pfeiffer or most recently Keri Russell who break out of the beauty trap with comedic smarts and fierce passion. ""Knocked Up"" abounds with fine performances Judd Apatows skill as a writer is matched by his direction of actors. Of the several cast members previously seen in ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and/or Mr. Apatows late lamented TV series ""Freaks and Geeks"" the most prominent are the filmmakers wife Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd. They play Allisons sister Debbie and her husband Pete whose married life is a no-fun-house-mirror version of what Ben and Allisons alliance might be. Indeed its a tacitly grim as well as hilarious picture of a couple struggling to make their marriage work just as Ben and his achievement-free buds are a sharply comic reflection of American adolescence as a lifelong career. Yet the movies big heart isnt in criticizing the way people live. ""Knocked Up"" has a more hopeful outlook on life and on Bens and Allisons prospects. Of all things its a paean to family values. Mr. Brooks ENLARGE Kevin Costner plays a serial killer in Mr. Brooks. ""Mr. Brooks"" manages to be deeply loathsome -- no small feat for a film thats shallowly amateurish. Kevin Costner stars if you can apply that term to self-besmirchment in the Jekyll-and-Hyde role of Earl Brooks a businessman who is also a serial killer. William Hurt plays a gloomy guy called Marshall; hes supposed to be Earls alter ego or maybe his id. Whatever Marshall is he and Earl have near-interminable discussions that fill the time between Earls killings. Dane Cook performs a notable act of levitation by rising if only sporadically above the role of a photographer turned blackmailer but Demi Moore as a police detective is right down there at Kevin Costners level raising questions about why presumably solvent actors would sign up for such squalid work. The film was directed by Bruce A. Evans who wrote the script with Raynold Gideon. Writing in this case meant piling on banal ideas then expressing them in turgid dialogue. At least the writing got the acting it deserved. Paprika ENLARGE For an alternate set of exciting alter egos see Satoshi Kons ""Paprika"" a brilliant anime feature in Japanese with English subtitles. The binary star is by day a demure Japanese research psychotherapist Dr. Atsuko Chiba and by night a fearless young warrior code named ""Paprika"" who can dive into patients dangerous dreams by using a device called a DC MINI. (In pre-psychological terms the sexy dream-diver is simply a hot version of the cool scientist or more simply still the spice of life.) Terrorists have stolen four prototypes of the device so the movie gives voice to a Japanese theme that goes all the way back to ""Godzilla"" a monster spawned by the atom bomb -- the loss of control over scientific creations. At the same time Satoshi Kon whose previous film was the remarkable ""Tokyo Godfathers"" uses the complex plot as a pretext for joyous psychedelia. Images tumble and flow as if truly in a dream from subconscious minds stuffed like junk shops with toys dolls circus animals parade floats pop artifacts and surreal movie scenes that suggest next year at Marienbad. The abundance is almost mad and madly enjoyable.    DVD TIP When diehard Kevin Costner fans wax nostalgic about his great roles they usually go back to ""Bull Durham"" a great movie against which theres nothing to be said or ""Field of Dreams"" and ""Dances With Wolves"" two movies against which theres plenty to say though Ill refrain from saying it here. As recently as 2003 however he directed and starred in a perfectly lovely Western called ""Open Range."" The title is ironic. In 1882 when the action takes place cowboys like Mr. Costners Charley driving free-range herds across public lands find themselves hunted down by ranchers with private holdings. The cast includes Robert Duvall and Annette Bening. James Muro did the expansive cinematography.

Save for later Saved Can you imagine the Bull Durham star as a serial killer? By Peter Ranier Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor June 1 2007 Save for later Saved Can you imagine Kevin Costner as a serial killer? Thats the premise of ""Mr. Brooks"" and its not as far-fetched as you might at first imagine.Costner became a star in films such as ""Bull Durham"" and ""Field of Dreams"" where his laconic romanticism invited comparisons to Gary Cooper. But he also had a tension - a temper - in those films that made such a comparison dubious.In truth Costner is often at his best when a bit of darkness encroaches on the glamour-boy glow. This is why unlike so many others I didnt chortle when I first heard about this new film. Playing against type isnt exactly unheard of in Hollywood. Its often how one wins Oscars. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? It would be nice to report that Costners bid paid off but ""Mr. Brooks"" aside from the low-key menace he exudes isnt much. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Earl Brooks is a wealthy businessman who seems to have it all - a gorgeous wife (Marg Helgenberger) doting college-age daughter (Danielle Panabaker) and public acclaim. (When the film begins he is being honored as Portlands ""Man of the Year."")But unknown to everyone he is also the infamous Thumbprint Killer and even though he hasnt killed in two years the old bloodlust has recently kicked in again. He cant help himself. He even goes to AA meetings because he only feels normal in a roomful of addicts.From a dramatic standpoint the only interest is the casting of William Hurt as Marshall Brookss alter ego. Marshall is Earls depraved id brought to life; they appear in many scenes together although the imaginary Marshall is visible only to Earl. This Jekyll-Hyde stunt is hokey but also surprisingly effective perhaps because Costners tamped-down creepiness matches up well with Hurts flagrant nuttiness.One dramatic ploy that doesnt work is the casting of Demi Moore as Tracy Edward a homicide detective intent on capturing the Thumbprint Killer. Moore gave a rare good performance as the washed up diva in ""Bobby"" but her stridency here is grating. In the battle between Tracy and Earl I was rooting for Earl. I dont think this is what the filmmakers intended.Grade C+ Rated R for strong violence some graphic sexual content nudity and language. Next up Marg Helgenberger returning to CSI? Sort of.

"Mr. Brooks Kevin Costner Will Slay You washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Mr. Brooks Kevin Costner Will Slay You William Hurt is the dark alter ego goading Kevin Costner down a bloody path as a serial killer. (By Ben Glass -- Element Films Via Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 1 2007 Our Mr. Brooks seems to have everything a beautiful wife a beautiful daughter a flourishing career a house fit for the cover of Architectural Digest and some nourishing hobbies. He likes to make ceramic pots and kill people. He likes to shoot them in the face then pose them provocatively. Very creative our Mr. Brooks yet at the same time quite thorough and as the Thumbprint Killer he has been driving the Portland cops mad for years. And when I tell you hes played by Kevin Costner dont your teeth just want to fall out? The movie ""Mr. Brooks"" features Costner at his most unlikely as a suave assured in-control morally repugnant psycho killer. The movie is a lot like the character Costner plays suave assured in-control and morally repugnant. You have to make peace with the idea that the film asks you to empathize with an executioner on the grounds of his style and to select him over another much less couth wannabe (but as yet unblooded) killer. Can you do that? If you cant best stay far away. Costners Earl Brooks owns a box factory that he rules with benevolent despotism in the coastal Oregon city. How can you hate a guy who wears a bow tie and dresses like a professor of medieval poetry at the Yale of the 50s? Hes just been named the chamber of commerce man of the year and accepts the award with grace and charm and heads back to the burbs to one assumes celebrate with the wife (Marg Helgenberger definitely a woman with whom most men would like to celebrate). But Marshall the gentleman in the back seat has other ideas. Speaking seductively into his ear Marshall (the oozing cooing William Hurt) tells Brooks hes earned a little fun. After all its been two years. That is two years since the Thumbprint Killer has given himself a little treat. And so on this night we stay with him from start to very violent -- disturbingly violent point-blank violent -- end. Marshall is actually Mr. Brookss bad alter ego a device by which the screenwriting partnership of Raynold Gideon and Bruce Evans (who also directed) explore the dynamics of Brookss mind. Frequently the two will chat while the excluded outsider doesnt have a clue; it looks funny and demands a willing suspension of disbelief and again if you cant deal with that go elsewhere. (The device is somewhat similar to Ron Howards trick in ""A Beautiful Mind."") From the interplay between Marshall and Earl we learn that Mr. Brooks considers himself an addict drawn to murder yet loathing himself for it and working desperately to recover. He even goes to AA -- hes a blood drunk -- where he is kind and nurturing to all and yet cant stop shooting people in the head as an expression of his need to meticulously display his control. He never makes a mistake until obviously this time. On the last killing Mr. Brooks forgets to check the curtains. They are open as the couple involved got some kind of kick out of making love in quasi-public (each of Mr. Brookss victims over the course of the movie will have some sort of vulgarity that will qualify him or her for elimination). So who should show up at the box factory the next day but a sleazy young man with a smirk an Army fatigue jacket and a beard (Dane Cook eschewing comedy) and a set of photographs of Brooks looking out the window the bodies in the background. Does he want money? No that would be ordinary and one of the pleasures of the movie is how it adroitly plays with then avoids the ordinary. What Mr. Smith wants is kicks; he wants to come along. He wants to be a buddy. So thats the first wrinkle. Wait no its the third wrinkle. The first wrinkle is the discovery that Costner is playing the better half of Mr. Brooks and the second wrinkle is that the usually benevolent Hurt is playing the worse half. The fourth wrinkle I suppose is that Cook isnt supposed to be funny but scurvy. Or maybe thats the fifth wrinkle with the fourth wrinkle being the discovery that Demi Moore doesnt play the wife but the cop. Then the sixth wrinkle -- or fifth moving five back to six -- is that the cop is rich Shes worth 60 mil. Shes in it for the sense of her own mastery. Well as you can tell the movie is flawed alas by what might be called wrinkle madness. Twists twists twists oh my God its the frozen head of Adolf Hitler that sort of thing. It has more wrinkles than my face. Its all wrinkly. Has it been in the bath too long? Is it a raisin an old baseball glove the sheets after a nightmare? And I havent even hinted at the wrinkle about the daughter. In the end the wrinkles and the smooth stylings of director Evans who sets the movie inside a perfect haute bourgeoisie world seem constantly at war. Im still trying to figure out whose body comes falling out of the ceiling at about the three-quarters point. A lot of the movie has to do with computer connections When we see whom Mr. Brooks is investigating we know whom hes stalking and the plot is supposed to instantly clarify. But in truth I missed much of that. Whats compelling then isnt the overwrought plot but the simpler things the dynamics between the actors the avuncularity between old pros Costner and Hurt the class condescension between Costner and Cook and Moores exasperated rich girl in comfortable shoes with a 9mm pistol on her hip. It has a fascinatin rhythm. Mr. Brooks (120 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for bloody grisly violence graphic sexual content nudity and profanity.

Wild-eyed mussy-haired comic Dane Cook also shows up (with hair pasted down) in a role that isnt funny but does a funny thing to the movie It makes Costners Earl Brooks a guy who gets off on offing people sympathetic. Scripted by Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon a veteran writing team (Stand by Me Star Man) and directed by Evans Mr. Brooks begins with its title character standing before the Portland (Ore.) Chamber of Commerce honored with the Businessman of the Year award. By his side Emma (Marg Helgenberger) the beaming blond wife. On the drive back to their sleek and lovely glass house someone else is at Earls side or over his shoulder anyway Marshall (Hurt) a quietly cackling fellow who seems to know Earls every thought. Like Harvey to Jimmy Stewart Marshall is Earls imaginary friend his alter ego a guy in a suit who walks around with Earl who eggs him on a killer confidant that only Earl knows is there - Earl and the audience. Earls been on a long hiatus from his homicides - his methodical ways had left him dubbed the Thumbprint Killer - but now Marshall and Earl decide its time to kill again. The victims have been stalked staked out profiled. Earl excuses himself from Emma heads off into the night and does the deed. But theres a glitch A gawker in an apartment building across the street has witnessed the killing and now hes approached Earl with photographic evidence and a twisted kind of blackmail scheme. Comedian Cook is the slimeball known as Mr. Smith and as Earl wrestles with what to do with this unexpected nuisance blotting a perfect streak of murders a police detective - Moore playing a tough cookie with her own set of problems - gets involved in the case. Slickly shot coolly edited oozing dark deadpan humor Mr. Brooks finds Costner at the top of his game. His moves are subtle his expressions flat his emotions clamped down contained. Hurts perfect as the sinister sidekick and Moore though she never appears face to face with Costner makes her presence known sharp assertive sexy in that no-nonsense Demi-esque way. If Mr. Brooks hits any wrong notes its in the relationship between Earl and his college-age daughter Jane (Danielle Panabaker). The filmmakers suggest that killing isnt the only thing Earl does in his spare time There are intimations intended or not that the father-daughter relationship may have gone in exceedingly icky directions. And when Jane returns home from campus with troubles of her own the way Earl decides to handle them - Earl and the screenwriters - doesnt quite make sense. But Mr. Brooks - the movie and the character - remains mostly under control. A successful businessman with killer instincts? Makes a lot of sense doesnt it? Mr. Brooks  (out of four stars) Directed by Bruce A. Evans written by Raynold Gideon and Evans photography by John Lindley distributed by MGM Pictures. Running time 2 hours Earl Brooks...............

In this ogre-ridden ocean-going summer of sequels ""Mr. Brooks"" reps a classic case of counter-programming. Original adult and starring Kevin Costner as a serial killer this suspense thriller with a smirk may not break any B.O. records but it should provide discriminating audiences the antidote they seek to Clooneys-and-Caribbean fever while giving Costners career a considerable kick in the credibility department. Costners mere presence in this noirish Bruce A. Evans-helmed psycho-drama -- which Costner also produced with longtime partner Jim Wilson and co-writer Raynold Gideon -- is an attention grabber. Although one of the actors best performances was as murderer Butch Haynes in Clint Eastwoods ""A Perfect World"" ""Mr. Brooks"" takes a tongue-in-cheek attitude toward murder and portrays its serial killer as an addicted personality who tries 12-stepping his way to a less-murderous lifestyle. It would have been an entirely different movie with a more conventional star -- Anthony Hopkins springs to mind (as does ""Silence of the Lambs""). But Costner delivers a complex cocktail of aloofness insecurity and reluctant threat which makes a novel script into something even more unusual. Add Demi Moore as the detective on the killers trail -- another case of mid-career adjustment -- and ""Mr. Brooks"" becomes as much about perception as it is a peculiar take on reality. By all appearances Earl Brooks is a pillar of his community. He even receives Man of the Year honors from an unnamed group in his unnamed city as his wife Emma (Marg Helgenberger) looks on adoringly. What none of the town folk-including Emma-know is that Earl has been murdering people for years -- expertly strategically cold-bloodedly. Although hes been keeping his homicidal demons at bay by attending AA meetings his conscience -- which has a name Marshall and is played by William Hurt -- is prodding him to break his tenuous self-imposed sobriety and spill fresh blood. Enter the subplots Tracy Atwood (Moore) is a predictably hard-as-nails detective who lost the so-called ""Thumbprint Killers"" trail two years earlier and has other things on her mind -- for one a gold digging soon-to-be-ex-husband (Jason Lewis). Earl too has tangential concerns A daughter (Danielle Panabaker) who may or may not have inherited his serial-killer gene (the science of ""Mr. Brooks"" may leave some viewers bewildered). And once he falls off the wagon killing a pair of dancers in their uncurtained bedroom Mr. Brooks acquires a kind of apprentice Mr. Smith (Dane Cook) who saw what Earl did and wants to go along for the thrill ride. There are also a pair of crystal-meth freaks out to avenge themselves on Tracy which provides the film its few shoot-em-up moments and a car crash or two. But ""Mr. Brooks"" is most effective when its dealing with Earl and his conscience. Hurt and Costner are terrific together as two sides of the same personality and again the casting is what its all about. Marshall could have been portrayed as a grotesque monster but instead hes a very close complement to Earl -- similar in age temperament and physique. John Lindleys subtle cinematography superbly delivers a morally dark film. Production values in general are topnotch.

"Mr. Brooks | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; mr-brooks ) Mr. Brooks (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Mr. Brooks is a curious mix of the campy and the intelligent of high concept and low psychology. In spite of these contradictions or perhaps because of them it works. This is a tense and engaging thriller the kind of movie where the audience may feel a little discomfort because the main character is an anti-hero but will be involved because hes so damn smart. And unlike the recent (and not entirely dissimilar) Fracture which built its ending on character assassination and unlikely contrivances Mr. Brooks stays true to its principals and their principles to the last frame. Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner) has been voted Portlands Man of the Year. Unbeknownst to everyone hes also the mysterious ""Thumbprint Killer"" a serial murderer who has been active on-and-off for a long time. Earl hasnt killed in two years but the hunger represented by his demonic alter-ego Marshall (William Hurt) has become too strong to resist. So after dropping his wife (Marg Helgenberger) home after the Man of the Year banquet he goes out for a little extracurricular fun. This time however Earl makes an uncharacteristic mistake. The window drapes of his victims apartment are open when he commits the murder and a voyeur (Dane Cook) photographs him in the act. Meanwhile police detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore) who has long investigated the Thumbprint Killer suspects her previously infallible quarry may have slipped up. Mr. Brooks handles the split personality by having two actors play facets of Earls personality. Kevin Costner is the rational intelligent dominant one. William Hurt is the amoral animalistic aspect who goes by the name of Marshall. Most of the time Earl is in control but there are times when Marshalls promptings become too powerful to ignore. The interaction between these actors is fascinating to observe. Although they take place solely in Earls mind director Bruce A. Evans has dramatized them by freezing time around Earl and Marshall and letting the dialogue play out. The approach is off-putting at first but it doesnt take long for the viewer to settle into the films rhythm. The story throws a couple of unexpected obstacles in Earls path. The character is so meticulous that it seems impossible that he could be caught unless he wants someone to stop him and this possibility is explored. Its interesting to note that despite the brutality of Earls acts hes actually a sympathetic character. Evans manages this by making Marshall the villain and Earl a tortured soul who would like to stop but cant because hes addicted. By dividing Earl into halves it becomes possible to like one and dislike the other. Earl is the perfect husband father and businessman. Marshall is a dark creature lurking in the corner of his soul thirsting for blood and mayhem. In fact Hurt is often shot in such a way that he appears spectral and predatory. The portrayal of Tracy Earls foil is less effective. Demi Moore tries to make her hard-edged but the character isnt believable. Her backstory which includes an ugly divorce and an escaped psycho feels contrived. She has moments of brilliant intuition but her tenacity leaves something to be desired. The tension between Tracy and Earl would have been heightened had she been more of a genuine threat and less of standard tough woman movie cop. Weve seen this character before and Mr. Brooks doesnt give her sufficient exposure to elevate her above the level of the clichA(c). With one exception Evans eschews cheap theatrics and relies upon his actors and the flow of the narrative to draw viewers in and keep them interested. There is one cheat of sorts and it achieves its aim of delivering a shock. Whether it works in the long-term is up to the individual viewer to decide. (I thought it served its purpose.) Despite the psychological complexity of the human mind illustrated by the dual representation the films approach is visceral. The murders are graphic and in one case bloody. There is sex and nudity. And Mr. Brooks has a macabre sense of humor. Costner and Hurt are both very good. During his early years in Hollywood Costner was as stiff as a board but age has allowed his talent to emerge. Earl is a tricky role. To play him Costner doesnt only have to portray an ""everyman"" but an everyman with a dark secret and a decayed core. Hurt has no trouble playing the diabolical Marshall. Demi Moore is less impressive as Tracy. The character is bland and while the writing is partially to blame Moore doesnt do anything to own the role. This is Bruce A. Evans second outing as a director and its a significant improvement over his debut - the Christian Slater vehicle Kuffs which reached theaters 15 years ago. Ultimately Mr. Brooks could be viewed as a classy B-grade thriller with an A-level cast. Aspects of the film reminded me of a little movie called The Stepfather with Terry OQuinn as a seemingly meek man who serially kills his wives and stepchildren when they disappoint him. Theres a little of him in Earl although Mr. Brooks is a better planner than The Stepfather. Smart characters make thrillers interesting and Earl passes the litmus test. Like him or hate him one cant help but admire the guys thoroughness. And its nice to sit in the audience and not always be one step ahead of everyone on screen.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review 91/2 Months Knocked Up is a knockout until it outstays its optimal running time. Plus The sweet insanity of Crazy Love. _ By David Edelstein ShareThis (Photo Suzanne Hanover/Courtesy of Universal; Illustration by Athletics) Judd Apatow (The 40-Year-Old Virgin) has carved out an enviable niche He makes films about boy-men in denial who are forced to face up to adult responsibilities yet along the way he gets to wallow in their geeky immaturity. He gets to be alternately grown-up and anal-expulsivea healthy design for living I submit. In Apatows disarming new comedy Knocked Up Alison (Katherine Heigl) a smart attractive and newly successful TV correspondent becomes pregnant after a drunken one-night stand and chooses both to have the baby and to try to bond with its father Ben (Seth Rogen) a titanically unsuitable dweebthe Pavarotti of stoner-losers. Its a film of deeply traditional values; it might even be taken as a parable for the postRoe v. Wade era. But Knocked Up feels very now. The banter is bruisingly funny the characters brilliantly childish the portrait of our cultures narrowing gap between children and their elders hystericalin all senses. Freaks and Geeks freaks will recognize Rogen (and Martin Starr and James Franco in a cameo as himself) and know that Apatows heart is with this overweight eyesoreeven when he lingers on Rogens huge rounded buttocks as Alison gazes on him in horror the morning after. Of course that they paired up in the first place tests our credulity As in Sideways the idea of a tall-drink-of-water blonde falling into bed with a pudgy penniless alcoholic dweeb suggests wishful thinking on the part of male filmmakers. (Dont misunderstand Those dweebs are my tribe and I endorse Jon Lovitzs Saturday Night Live exhortation to the ladies Low-er your stan-dards. Its just that the corollarycute guy and fat unattractive womanis as rare as svelte heterosexual male film critics.) Rogens Ben stands for a life of comfy self-indulgence untroubled by a need for luxury or fame. He lives in a nest of unhygienic stoners (among them Starr the Uber-nerd on Freaks and Geeks now somewhat more presentableand the object of a good running gag involving a bet a beard Islamic terrorists and Cat Stevens). He and his flatmates idly tinker with a Website that documents the nude scenes of famous actresses. Merely to watch the poised Alison pick her way around the debris of these human slugs is a hoot; its a visual oxymoron. But Apatow has the wit to depict the rest of Alisons life as a tiptoe among land mines of brattinessfrom the whiny celebrities she interviews on the E channel to the affluent sister (Leslie Mann) and brother-in-law (Paul Rudd) who represent marital stability and seethe with loathing for each other. Its against this appalling backdropand the obsession with skinniness of her network employersthat Alison decides to have her baby in spite of advice from her mother to get rid of it. That decision is never exploredit just is; and Apatow has little to say about the struggles economic and otherwise of single-motherhood. As in The 40-Year-Old Virgin he chooses to leave out the darker dimensions of his male protagonists backward behaviors. (That someone who is a virgin at 40and not for religious reasonswould be such an open friendly all-around good guy instead of a twisted self-hating misogynistic troll is more wishful thinking.) The first 100 minutes could simply not be betterbut as Knocked Up drifts over the two-hour mark a little of the air goes out of it. In between each chapter of the film are shots of the growing fetusits What to Expect When Youre Expecting The Motion Picture and it gets all goo-goo-eyed with baby-worship (a hazard in pregnancy films as in life). If youve seen one funny delivery scene youve seen them all. (Showing the baby actually coming out is as my old theater mentors used to say an interesting choiceand a really gross one.) Knocked Up is still a knockout. Apatows talent is for telling complicated truths about the peculiar ways in which people defend themselves from the pain of livingwith jokes. Jokes as deep as they are wide. A succession of OB/GYNs each nuttier and less reassuring than the last evokes all the weird anxieties of pregnancy. The network scenes kill. Having worked on The Larry Sanders Show and dealt with his share of Hollywood executives Apatow nails their passive-aggression and gets a gem of a turn out of Kristen Wiig as a producer whos manifestly jealous of Alisons on-air career Listen to how Wiig delivers neutral lines like an ace major-league pitcher taking a little something off them and turning them into screwballs. Heigl is the Alice in this wonderland of loonsand the straighter she is the funnier. Rogen never goes soft on Ben. His aversion to commitment is instinctive Hes like those men whose mates have to say Look me in the eyeand who need all the courage they can muster to maintain that contact. Leslie Manns performance is the breakout. In rare moments of repose her voice is a purr on par with Patricia Clarksons but when it stabs she and Norman Bates are all by themselves. Watch her build to a crescendo nice and easy as she fixes her eyes on her insufficiently sensitive spouse I am trying to be nice to you right now but Im struggling with it because I wanna rip your fucking head off you dipshit. Rudd plays off her perfectly offering a blank facade choosing to absent himself from the battlefield. Yet Mann is alluring damn it. Id say this was the craziest couple on screen right now except 1 2 Next Share this story...
