Jerry Shaw (Shia LaBeouf) answered his cell phone after finding his apartment crammed with guns passports and other terrorist paraphernalia and ended up on the FBIs sht list. A mystery woman -- lets just call her MW -- on the other line told him to flee but he failed to act. Then MW gave single-mom-doing-her-damnedest Rachel Holloman (Michelle Monaghan) a ring and threatened to harm her son unless she joined Jerry on an extremely dangerous and destructive dont-think-just-do-what-youre-told mission that neither of them understands. Instructions are on a need-to-know basis only ""steal that briefcase from those armed men"" ""inject yourself with this chemical."" And if they dont comply shell know. MWs got a knack for tapping into technology -- digital message displays traffic lights cell phones. And if she notices that you got on the wrong train shell text the other passengers and tell them to throw you off. (And dont think they wont listen.) Yet even when making death threats MW maintains her polite verbal cool. Which makes her a mayhem-making mother which makes me both respect and fear the proper British GPS lady who tells me when to turn. (I can tell shes pissed when she has to ""recalculate"" because I wasnt paying attention.) When Rachel Jerry and the other characters involved do what theyre told Eagle Eyes one fast furious and fiery action film -- a ride at breakneck speed with few plot pit stops. And you should know numerous vehicles were harmed in the making of this film. They all blowed up good ... real good. Watching them hurl through the air exploding two or three at a time one after the other for about 10 minutes however is rather disorienting and potentially PTSD-inflicting. Nevertheless if you are similarly willing to barrel along with director D.J. Caruso at breakneck speed without asking questions it could easily make for an enjoyable thrill ride. A cleverly pieced plot puzzle holds the suspense steady until the last few minutes. Shia Michelle and Billy Bob played their parts with believable fervor but is it only me who has a hard time buying into LaBeouf as action badass? And Id mention more good points but I dont want to spill any beans. Including a character who I think is worthy of a spinoff feature film. (Heres a clue but also a potential spoiler Think Barbarella and 2001 A Space Odysseys love child.) On the other hand if youre more cautious you might question not only the disturbing pliability and predictability of the pawns in Eagle Eyes deadly game but also their baffling capability to complete tasks that would have surely killed better men (and women) -- even with the aid of a gifted computer hack. Is it that easy for the average American to aim and shoot without losing an eye? Or blast through a barrage of exploding cars not once but several times and not lose an eye? True most of Hollywood isnt plausible but usually it offers an excuse for its absurdity. Vat of nuclear waste = superpowers. And if MW knows so much shouldnt she have known Rachel couldnt drive stick? The moral of the movie (if you saw the trailer you should have seen the moral coming) is rather groan-worthy -- and not something we need to be reminded of again. Its plainly spoken at the end but audible throughout the film. A warning about the threat in our own backyard -- but as often is the case with Hollywood blockbusters the warning comes across more like fear-mongering than constructive social criticism. Personally I prefer my cinema sans mongering.

All of which might be a worthwhile undertaking if the movie itself were credible for more than a microsecond. Jerry (Shia LaBeouf) is just your ordinary Chicago slacker until his bank account mysteriously balloons he gets home to a flat unexpectedly packed with bomb-making equipment and The Voice calling his mobile tells him hes only got seconds before the Feds arrive to arrest him. The Voice knows its stuff and seemingly has traffic lights the Chicago transport network dockside cranes and every cellphone in America in its power. Hard-pressed single mum Rachel (Michelle Monaghan) is in a similar predicament and soon this thrown-together duo are being ushered across America for reasons that become clearer - but never make any sense.No questions repeats The Voice and its good advice in the circumstances as we wonder whether to laugh or cry at this cavalcade of contrivance. Distraction is provided by sundry car chases and explosions which would doubtless leave hundreds dead in the real world yet here its izzy-wizzy pixel-land where nothing matters except the instant rush of faked urgency. Hollywood superficiality at its most mindless? You bet. But theres also a puppy-dog doesnt-know-any-better enthusiasm to this pacy fluff which means you cant get that worked up at it. And FBI agent Billy Bob Thornton is worth the odd smile.

"Eagle Eye reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Eagle Eye reviewed. Eagle Eye reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 26 2008 408 PM Bird-Brained Shia LaBeouf in Eagle Eye. By Josh Levin Lynn Cohen and Shia LaBeouf in Eagle Eye Earlier this month Steven Spielberg and DreamWorks got sued for allegedly lifting the plot of 2007s Disturbia from Rear Window. It wont help their case that Eagle Eye (DreamWorks) the latest collaboration between executive producer Spielberg star Shia LaBeouf and director D.J. Caruso borrows its innocent-man-on-the-run premise from North by Northwest--theres even a scene where as in Hitchcocks crop-duster sequence the protagonist gets attacked by faceless adversaries in an open field in the middle of the day. Then again Eagle Eye could just as well have been called The Young WarGames Chronicles or Die Hard 4 Service Pack 2. Caruso and Spielberg perhaps in an effort to confuse the lawyers have strip-mined every movie-- 2001 Enemy of the State I Robot and Paycheck come to mind--in which microchips go wild. Josh Levin Josh Levin is Slates executive editor. D.J. Caruso is the cuttlefish of directors content to blend in with his action-movie surroundings rather than conjure an original vision. While Eagle Eyes waypoints are so familiar that a game of action-movie bingo wouldnt last until the end of the first reel--look out for the briefcase with a red digital countdown--it does at least have some gloss around the edges. For example even as the movie borrows the traffic-light manipulations of Live Free or Die Hard and The Italian Job its opening chase scene manufactures a few thrills of its own The pacing the sound and the effects are all in the 90th percentile of such things and the closing cars-vs.-hooks-in-a-wrecking-yard bit will make for a tremendous set piece in a tie-in video game. Theres also promise in the disembodied Knight Rider-gone-bad voice thats commanding our heroes (LaBeouf and Mission Impossible IIIs Michelle Monaghan) to abandon the principles of defensive driving. By placing the menace off-screen Eagle Eye tantalizes with the prospect that the enemy once revealed wont be dumb. Advertisement That prospect doesnt last very long. Spielberg and Caruso forgot to include Phone Booth in their list of movies to rip off--the key to that 2003 thriller is that the man behind the demented voice isnt revealed until the final moments. Eagle Eye reveals much too soon that the movies animating force ... SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT ... is a Defense Department computer named Aria. Like all cinematic supercomputers that go on the rampage Aria is vexed and mystified by the inhumane ways of the human race. In order to form a more perfect union she futzes with the power grid; blackmails and kidnaps civilians; uses government drones to take out domestic targets; dabbles in warrantless wiretapping; and commandeers mobile phones LCD screens and the home-theater department of a Circuit City as a means of getting herself heard. Though Aria does serve as a handy preview of what the Patriot Act might allow circa 2016 this level of omniscience and omnipotence feels like overkill when used to push around Shia LaBeouf. After Transformers and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull Eagle Eye feels less like a vehicle for an action hero than the latest in a series of national focus groups to determine LaBeoufs commercial viability. Perhaps owing to his start as a child stand-up comic the one-time Disney Channel star has a facility for delivering post-explosion one-liners. (After one of Arias remarkable technology-harnessing stunts he notes with eyebrows and hackles raised that ""she could probably turn a train into a talking duck."") But quips alone do not a popcorn-movie star make. In this age of post-steroidal leading men you dont need to be Arnold Schwarzenegger to carry a movie but you do need to have some presence. LaBeouf fails the first question on the action-hero screen test Do you struggle to command attention when sharing the screen with a computerized voice? Correction Oct. 3 2008 This piece originally misquoted a line spoken by LaBeouf. The correct phrasing is ""she could probably turn a train into a talking duck"" not ""a walking duck.""

"Eagle Eye Assaults the senses like a sledgehammer | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsEagle Eye Assaults the senses like a sledgehammerEagle Eye s many deficiencies make it far from a classic thriller. But it might represent the birth of a whole new suspense genre the nagger.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Sept. 26 2008 Eagle Eye (out of 4)Starring Shia LaBeouf Michelle Monaghan Billy Bob Thornton and Rosario Dawson. Directed by D.J. Caruso. 117 minutes. At major theatres. 14A Eagle Eyes many deficiencies make it far from a classic thriller. But it might represent the birth of a whole new suspense genre the nagger.The phantom female voice constantly hectoring Shia LaBeoufs reluctant hero Jerry via cellphone text messages and electronic road signs is like the nagging mom from hell. She delivers an emotional beatdown worse than anything Joan Crawford ever dished out. (James McAvoy was equally gobsmacked in Wanted but at least he had sexy Angelina Jolie yanking his chain.)When not badgering Jerry for failing to follow her potentially lethal instructions (""Youre not listening"") or insisting upon punctuality (""Arrive no later than 11 a.m."") The Voice does everything she can to undermine the poor geeks self-confidence.Such as the kick to the gonads she delivers when she tells Jerry that he learned to walk a full six months after his brighter and more successful twin brother the one whose sudden demise has thrown Jerry into a whirlwind of hot lead and hotter tongue. The implication being of course that Jerry has always been the slower and dumber twin.And how does The Voice know these intimate details of Jerrys pathetic life? You have to wait for the big reveal for that but suffice to say that its your basic Grand Conspiracy by faceless spooks the difference here being that these spooks also lay on guilt trips. Imagine the crop duster pilot in North by Northwest chasing Cary Grant but also bellowing at him via bullhorn for forgetting to take out the trash.You get the picture but can you also handle it? Unintentionally amusing when its not being downright goofy the summers last popcorn flick assaults the senses like a sledgehammer to a migraine sufferer. Director D.J. Caruso and his screenwriting committee barely set up the terrorist frame-up scenario dumbstruck Jerry is caught with an apartment full of guns and bombs. Then they charge into a lengthy chase sequence through Chicago Indianapolis and Washington D.C. that is so blindingly fragmented it could stun a charging bull moose.The effect overrides brain cells well enough for about the first hour as Jerry teams with single mom Rachel (Michelle Monaghan) whose kidnapped son is her reason for also obeying the instructions of The Voice. In hot pursuit of Jerry and Rachel is FBI flatfoot Thomas Morgan (Billy Bob Thornton) who obviously worships at the altar of Tommy Lee Jones. Morgan isnt buying the couples pathetic bleats that theyve been framed ""This is a bad time to be in the terrorism business"" he intones. Is there ever a good time?Rosario Dawson is also in this movie playing a navy specialist of some kind but she appears to have been cast solely to give Thornton a female to yell at.In between the action we get the blinding insight that cameras and trackers are everywhere computers cant be trusted and sometimes patriotism is tragically misguided. Stanley Kubrick and Sydney Pollack just called from heaven to say they want their paranoia back.It all wears very thin by the third act when The Voice really starts to grate and all remaining sense slams into a brick wall. Long before this time the astute viewer will realize that LaBeouf the new protege of executive producer Steven Spielberg keeps playing the same bedazzled delinquent in movie after movie.The real conspiracy here I think runs deeper than just a misguided attempt to blow up the U.S. government. I think Eagle Eye is a cleverly packaged collection of outtakes from Transformers. But instead of a giant male robot tossing LaBeouf around its a bitchy robotic female voice. Some might call that progress but I call it Mommy Dearest 2 The Satanic Pest.

Shia LaBeouf is shown in a scene from the thriller ""Eagle Eye."" Photo Kerry Hayes Paramount Pictures Movie review Eagle Eye 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Eagle Eye Thriller. Starring Shia LaBeouf Michelle Monaghan Rosario Dawson and Billy Bob Thornton. Directed by D.J. Caruso. (Rated PG-13. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) So imagine this. A young slacker who cant even pay his rent at a boarding house goes to an ATM and finds 750K in his bank account. He goes back to his one room feeling rich and lucky and sees that dozens of packages have arrived for him. But what are they? Guns chemical weapons and explosives. And then before he has a minute to digest this - boom - the FBI comes through the door and arrests him as a terrorist. Now thats a premise folks. Sure maybe its not one for a masterpiece but its more than good enough to take an audience from dead-stop indifference to full-throttle interest What is going on? Who is doing this? What is going to happen next? Those questions are what ""Eagle Eye"" has going for it. The rest of the movie doesnt have three brain cells to rub together but the premise carries it a long way. An engaging Shia LaBeouf plays the young man plucked out of obscurity and suddenly in trouble. Hows this for a bad break? He is taken to headquarters and Billy Bob Thornton turns out to be the agent assigned to his case ""This is the wrong time to be in the terrorism business."" The title character in ""Eagle Eye"" is a womans voice who calls our hero on his cell phone and demonstrates that she can see him wherever he goes whatever he does. She threatens him. The voice also sees hears and gives orders to Michelle Monaghan who plays a divorced mother with no connection to government or politics. Using threats and coercion the voice brings the two characters together for a miserable thrill ride. The nature of that voice - who is she and what does she want? - is the central mystery of the picture. Three things keep ""Eagle Eye"" from being an unambiguous success. The first is that the power of the unseen voice is so complete that it verges on ridiculous. The voice sees and overhears everything everywhere controls all machinery and can kill anyone at will to the point that the movie at times threatens to slip into farce. The second is that director D.J. Caruso falls too much in love with his set design and so he slows down the pace and lavishes time on scenes that are essentially static. Finally though the movie answers every plot mystery it raises the answers are a little pat. Not terrible just a bit disappointing. Its as if somewhere in the middle the studio decided to invest real money in ""Eagle Eye"" and bloat it into a major action movie instead of a small cheesy thriller. There were the makings here of a really good small cheesy thriller. -- Advisory Lots of action violence but nothing too disturbing.

"Eagle Eye | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; eagle-eye ) Eagle Eye (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli There is no truth to the rumor that free frontal lobotomies will be performed at the entrance to all theaters showing Eagle Eye. This movie tests the viewing publics tolerance for enduring crass stupidity when the payoff is a series of repetitive ADD infected chase scenes. Director D.J. Caruso (paired again with his leading man from Disturbia) does a moderately good job of hiding how incredibly dumb this screenplay is by keeping things moving at such a whirlwind pace that a lot more seems to be happening than actually is. In reality the chase scenes dont mean anything because they dont advance the plot - its mice on a treadmill running and running and not getting anywhere. The hope is that the edits will come so fast and furious and the music will be so loud and the actors will display such expressions of near-panic that maybe viewers will mistake all this chaos for suspense. Jerry Shaw (Shia LaBeouf) is a good-for-nothing layabout a Stanford drop-out who earns a living by working at a copy store while making a few extra bucks on the side playing cards. One day he stops by an ATM machine to withdraw some money and discovers that theres 750000 in his account. He gets home to find his apartment filled floor-to-ceiling with illegal weapons and bomb-making ingredients. He then receives a mysterious call on his cell phone telling him that if he doesnt get out in 30 seconds hell be arrested. Rachel Holloman (Michelle Monaghan) is a single mother sending her son off on a trip. While hes away she spends a night out on the town with her girlfriends. A call from her ""son"" lures her out of a bar onto a street but the voice on the other end of the phone is the same mysterious caller who warned Jerry. Rachel is informed that unless she completes a series of actions the train carrying her son will derail and he will be killed. Rachel does as shes told and is brought face-to-face with Jerry. Together these two go on a convoluted trip to do the bidding of the voice which has the power to control electronic devices all around the world to get them where theyre supposed to go. Eagle Eye has all the earmarks of a once substantive script that was poked prodded cut and crimped until all semblance of intelligence was wrung out of it. Its still possible to see the cautionary message underlying the movie something about the danger of Big Brother and the result of giving computers too much control. The former was more than adequately explored by George Orwell. The latter has formed the fulcrum of countless science fiction stories including Star Trek episodes 2001 and this years best animated feature WALLE. It feels almost unclean to write a review for something as bad as Eagle Eye and include those fine titles. The films central flaw (although by far not its only one) is not difficult to discern. If an entity has the ability to access and control all networked computers and electronic devices around the world giving it virtually limitless power why does it need a couple of human beings to do its bidding? And even if it chooses to use them why send them on such an unbelievably long and convoluted wild goose chase when the same end could have been accomplished more simply. This issue looms so large that it is impossible to be ignored by anyone who allows a moments thought to pass through his mind while watching Eagle Eye. The movie was made for the brain dead the catatonic and those who have taken allergy medicine and are unable to stay awake. Some will doubtless praise Carusos virtuosity with action scenes but theres a lot of sleight of hand going on there. The action is mediocre with its rhythm being supplied in the editing room. Theres no suspense or tension because the characters are paper-thin and a thinking viewer is at least two or three steps ahead of the screenplay. Its embarrassing when the audience figures out every ""twist"" before its explicitly revealed. It would be nice to see Shia LaBeouf appear in a movie that gives him a chance to act. Lately all he has been doing is standing around playing a foreground ornament to a bunch of special effects. His work here is indistinguishable from his ""performances"" in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and Transformers. Hes playing the same individual Run Shia run Michelle Monaghan is as unconvincing as she is unappealing in this part (although I like her in general) and the spark that might make things interesting between Rachel and Jerry is missing. Billy Bob Thornton and Rosario Dawson are on hand to pick up paychecks. Its easy to forgive Dawson - she has to appear in stuff like this so she can afford to work for next-to-nothing in the many small films in which she has roles. Thornton has simply gotten lazy. The average positive review of this film will remark that ""its a fun ride if you turn off your brain."" Im not sure why anyone would want to turn off their brain since thats the organ where the bodys pleasure centers are located. Even granting that when it comes to dumb popcorn movies Eagle Eye is nowhere near the top. What makes the film even more disappointing is its veneer of social commentary about nonstop surveillance and the omnipotence of computers. These things are red herrings that like Carusos frantically edited chase scenes are designed to camouflage the bankruptcy of the writing. Should this film be a huge box office success it will stand as a sad testament to how low the bar for cinematic entertainment has been set. Eagle Eye (United States 2008) Director D.J.

Eagle Eye (PG-13) Dreamworks (118 min.) Directed by D.J. Caruso. With Shia LeBeouf Michelle Monaghan.Opens Friday at theaters in New Jersey. TWO STARS Got a cell phone in your pocket? Evil forces are using it right now to track you and tap into your conversations. Better take it out and remove the battery. Thinking of making a run for it? Think twice. These villains can turn all traffic rights red lock down your engine or even send a robot fighter plane after you. These are the warnings generally made by the folks who wear tinfoil hats and have 50-pound bags of powdered milk stored in their basement just in case. But theyre also the backstory to the paranoid cyberthriller ""Eagle Eye."" Its probably not wise to say much more. (Not easy either -- the plots both confusing and familiar and if I told you the old sci-fi movie it borrows from it would give the rest away). Basically it takes two innocents and maneuvers them into a situation where theyre blackmailed into helping the bad guys pursued as terrorists by the good ones and spied on by both at every turn. And then punctuates the scenes with the kind of special-effects explosions only Michael Bay could love. ""Eagle Eye"" is big loud and expensive but its not particularly entertaining. Shia LeBeouf is the hero but he remains little more than a pleasant presence (although clearly Steven Spielberg a producer here sees something I dont -- this is his third project with the young actor). As the heroine Michelle Monaghan is painlessly forgettable. Theres more juice as there often is in the supporting roles. Billy Bob Thornton has two or three good scenes as a snarling FBI investigator; Rosario Dawson gets to stay buttoned-up for once as a naval intelligence agent striding around and barking orders. (Although she would have added more life to the film if she played Monaghans part.) But the central conceit -- which consists of LeBeoufs cell ringing all the time to give him orders -- gets tiresome early on. And the breadth of the technological conspiracy -- with the villain able to not only broadcast messages to specific TV screens but to overload a high-tension wire just in time for it to collapse and electrocute someone -- is simply absurd. Stretching the limits of plausibility is allowable (and in films like ""North by Northwest"" Hitchcock did it constantly). But Hitchcock also knew how important stars were in suspending our disbelief (and how trivial the actual nuts-and-bolts detail of the movie conspiracy was). Director D.J. Caruso and his four credited screenwriters dont. Thats too bad because Caruso made a failed but interesting film in ""The Salton Sea"" and his last film with LeBeouf ""Disturbia"" owed much to ""Rear Window"" (although whether it was an homage or an outright heist is currently being debated). He would seem to be the right choice for a movie like this. Except he makes all the wrong choices. The movie is so huge its small characters get lost in it; for a film thats really an extended cross-country chase theres no sense of place and its two stars dont connect -- either with each other or with us. Its a shame because theres a definite chill to its central idea of being watched all the time. Too bad it didnt find its expression in a more watchable movie. Rating note The film contains violence and strong language. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Did you re alize for instance that right now in the US of A gizmos make it possible to write a script while flicking from ""Enemy of the State"" to ""North by Northwest"" to ""2001""? With its array of chases and shootouts and a sinister political plot the movie at least holds your attention and keeps things brisk-ish. But every scene still bears the tags of the place from which it was stolen. Shia LaBeouf - who announces that he is a grown-up leading man by wearing one of those starter beards that you remember on the skeeviest guys of sophomore year - plays Jerry. Jerrys an underachiever who comes home one day to find his apartment filled with automatic weapons timing devices and fertilizer. These things are also the building blocks of the screenplay. An all-powerful force personified in an antiseptic female telephone voice that keeps calling Jerry to tell him when to jump and how high contrives to get him both arrested and freed. (So why not skip the arrest?) The voice can also with unerring accuracy and impeccable timing control traffic lights to create car pileups flash Jerry advice on electronic street signs and arrange for cranes to crash through windows. Obviously this thing doesnt run on Windows. One victim is a mom (Michelle Monaghan) whom the voice orders to rendezvous with Jerry and provide opportunities for bland dialogue. After the pair have nearly had their molecules ripped apart about eight different ways instead of asking each other pertinent questions such as ""Who is out to get us?"" they instead engage in forced ""character development."" The script comes from the ubiquitous ""creative visionaries"" as the press notes call them Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman who also provided us with scripts for ""Transformers"" and its forthcoming sequel. They also wrote ""Mission Impossible III"" the new show ""Fringe"" and Decembers forthcoming ""Star Trek"" film. Are they being stretched thin? There are lots of new wrinkles to ponder about American surveillance but it seems that all the writers have surveilled is HBO. They havent quite worked out that the point of the Jason Bourne movies is the cunning details of how Bourne wiggles through the net; this time all the gadgets are working to keep the heroes alive. That means theyre as passive as pingpong balls-except when the voice forces them to get creative at which point the heroes become active but ridiculous. As for ""North by Northwest"" which is alluded to in an otherwise inexplicable scene (the two leads pop up in the sticks for no reason) it offered a sharpness of lapels and wit. This movie gives us an array of lines like ""She could derail a train. She could probably turn it into a talking duck."" There isnt even a hint of romance possibly because the leads are so age- mismatched that things would turn into the Mary Kay Letourneau story. Even that wouldnt be as weird as this movies contention that in order to invade the core of Americas political structure all you need to do is flash somebody elses ID beat up the only policeman in sight and steal his uniform. EAGLE EYE Enema of the state. Running time 118 minutes. Rated PG-13 (profanity violence).

Joe Neumaier Friday September 26 2008 841 AM Finally an action-adventure thriller that feels as if it were created directed and acted soup to nuts by a computer program. See everyone complains about humans in movies but no one does anything about it so it fell to ""Eagle Eye"" to make everything laughably ridiculously fake. Even the scruff on Shia LaBeoufs cherubic face feels digitally added.It took a traffic jam of screenwriters - theres four of them - to craft this story of a slacker named Jerry (LaBeouf looking like a lil Ratso Rizzo) who after his twin brother dies gets mysterious messages on his cell and on street signs guiding him away from danger. How does the metallic-voiced woman on the phone know where he is at all times? And how does she know that as an infant he learned to walk six months later than his twin? Is she a robot mother-in-law? Jerry is soon joined by a woman (Michelle Monaghan) experiencing the same stalking problem and whose son is in danger. Suddenly theyre off on a familiar journey - ""North by Northwest"" and ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" are poached from though the biggest lift is from ""2001 A Space Odyssey."" And director D.J. Caruso refuses to inject any self-aware humor not even when Monaghan handles a semi-automatic like a mad Minuteman. LaBeouf the boy-of-the-moment who manages to underwhelm every time at bat has too paper-thin a persona to come off hunted and haggard. Monaghan simply has to look determined but she suffers from Sandra Bullock syndrome She just isnt an action heroine. The one authentic thing in ""Eagle Eyes"" overloaded motherboard of a plot is last-act indignation at how the Constitution is currently being abused. But then a guy gets zapped into a French fry by a power line and all you can do is shake your head. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

The film is a rag bag of concepts and characters from earlier vastly better movies. It has high-tech production values and features enough car wrecks to deserve a slot in the stuntmans hall of fame. But if youre a fan of ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" ""Live Free or Die Hard"" ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" ""WarGames"" or ""Colossus The Forbin Project"" youll want to attack the screen with a box cutter. The screenplay for this larcenous cluster clump is attributed to a team of four writers. Either the chimpanzees insisted on anonymity because they knew ""Eagle Eye"" would kill their careers or a quartet of D-list screenwriters are four times as dumb as one soulless hack working alone. The film begins with one of those generic antiterrorist military ops where the Nevada desert stands in for Durkadurkastan. We know were in action-movie fantasy land when the mission goes wrong and U.S. Secretary of Defense Michael Chiklis looks gravely troubled for having blown up the wrong village. After such a bombastic opening it is traditional to cut to an unsuspecting dupe half a world away whose life will be forever changed in ways he cant imagine thanks to the character-building influence of automatic weapons fire and orange fireballs. ""Eagle Eye"" gives us rat-faced Shia LaBeouf as slacker card sharp Jerry Shaw whose itchy-looking boy-beard tells us hes too disaffected to shave and too wussy to grow a decent Fidel. Hes the feckless low-achieving twin of an Air Force hero recently deceased. Jerrys decision to drop out of Stanford is mentioned so often that this may be the first instance of product placement by a major university. His dad is so disappointed in him that he practically punches him when he mopes up the church aisle to sniffle beside his twin brothers coffin. The image of melancholy LaBoeuf weeping over dead LaBoeuf is one of the few amusing special effects in the movie though I dont think they intended us to laugh. EAGLE EYE  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of action and violence and for language. This simpering dorks journey to manhood is the subtext of a movie in which a mysterious all-powerful thing that I shouldnt describe controls every automated aspect of our world. Through cell-phone messages delivered in the cloying tones of an OnStar operator it drags Jerry and sensitive single mom Rachel (Michelle Monaghan) into a vast conspiracy. This thing Im tiptoeing around has powers over everything electronic that would make Magneto jealous. It can control elevated trains bank records traffic lights security cameras airport baggage handling systems jet fighter planes high-tension electric power lines and everything else that Cheetah Bonzo Lancelot Link and J. Fred Muggs believe is hooked up to the Internet. And for some cockamamie reason it decides that Jerry and Rachel are the ideal candidates to pull off an operation that would test the skills of James Bond and Lara Croft. Without giving away too much it wants some important people neutralized and sends two untrained unwilling amateurs to do the job when it could have just dropped a jetliner on the targets. Silly silly chimps There is a nugget of delight in the film. Billy Bob Thornton is endlessly entertaining as the cagey FBI honcho pursuing the stars. Hes the real hero of the movie and its dry comic relief a decisive intelligent perfectionist who suffers fools sarcastically and is somehow gruffly lovable. If every lawman were this wise and cool nobody would mind trading their Miranda Rights for the Patriot Act. Hes the only character youd like to see come back in a sequel or spinoff and they botch that too.

"In Eagle Eye a web of deceit - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review A web of deceit in Eye Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan on the run in Eagle Eye. (Ralph nelson) By Ty Burr Globe Staff / September 26 2008 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + The last time D.J. Caruso directed Shia LaBeouf the movie was called ""Disturbia"" and the most disturbing thing about it was the obviousness with which everyone involved was ripping off Alfred Hitchcocks ""Rear Window."" How obvious? The owners of the short story on which ""Window"" was based are currently suing citing ""Disturbia"" as an unauthorized remake.""Eagle Eye"" likewise is a movie only a copyright lawyer could love. It strip-mines at least three Hitchcock classics - ""North by Northwest"" ""The Wrong Man"" and ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" - then commits unlawful assault on Stanley Kubricks ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" just for the heck of it. Serene in the knowledge that few moviegoers under the age of 30 have heard of any of these movies let alone seen them ""Eagle Eye"" is Hitch for a modern age bloated by steroids addled by action and incapable of long-term attention.Is it any fun? For an act of pillage its pretty entertaining. Bring earplugs and Dramamine though and keep ""Vertigo"" cued up on the DVD player for when you get home.LaBeouf plays the wrong man in question a mopey Chicago copy clerk named Jerry Shaw whose life goes haywire after his identical twin Ethan dies. Ethan was the good brother and now his work in top-secret US Air Force skullduggery is landing upon the head of prodigal slacker Jerry. The phone rings and a pleasant womans voice informs Jerry that the FBI is about to crash through his door and hed better get moving.The same woman calls single mother Rachel Holloman (Michelle Monaghan) and orders her to go to the corner and hop in a waiting Porsche. If Rachel doesnt her young son (Cameron Boyce) will be lunchmeat. In that Porsche having escaped sour-faced FBI agent Tom Morgan (Billy Bob Thornton) through developments you wouldnt believe if I told you is Jerry. All right were hooked Whats going on here?The subject is info-age paranoia - the lingering fear that our every move is being watched and stored by a post-Internet post-Patriot Act somebody or other. Whoever the voice is or represents she can control traffic lights ATM machines LED signs surveillance cameras and the nations entire telephone grid and air traffic control system. She barks out driving directions like a GPS dominatrix. If youve spent any time navigating a corporations recorded answering menu you know this voice and shes your worst nightmare.Youve probably figured out who she is but Jerry and Rachel are too busy dashing around like lab rats to wonder. Theres a screeching multi-car pile-up that Caruso films with overaggressive close-ups - you cant tell whos crashing into whom - and toward the end a scene that one-ups the biplane-in-a-cornfield bit in ""North by Northwest."" Now its a fighter pilot roaring through a highway tunnel. The studios probably think this is progress.Far in the distance straining to keep up are fine actors like Thornton Rosario Dawson (as a crisp Air Force investigator) Anthony Mackie (as a Pentagon insider) and Michael Chiklis of TVs ""The Shield"" (as a mournful secretary of defense). He has reason to look constipated given the films mounting improbabilities. Just one for example There are unexplained crashes and detonations all over Washington and the State of the Union Address goes on as planned? Whats the threat level - taupe?LaBeouf tackles his first grown-up leading man role and hes . . . adequate. Anyway hes not the movies star - the central gimmick and the action sequences are - so any young actor could have played the part. LaBeoufs lack of heft unfortunately is underscored by the casting of the decade-older Monaghan opposite him and by the movies nervousness over whether there should be a romance or not. Theres one kiss but its a quick peck on the cheek. I guess shes sending him off to school.The germ of ""Eagle Eye"" apparently originated years ago with executive producer Steven Spielberg but Caruso and producers Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci (they wrote ""Transformers"" after coming off TVs ""Alias"") are the governing sensibilities. Their approach could be called Twist and Smash The scripts busy enough to keep you guessing and the cracks are papered over with speed and noise.The borrowings from older better movies are used the way youd retrofit a classic engine into an assembly-line chassis. No one in the audience needs to know thats the Albert Hall climax from ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" rumbling under the final scenes set in the US Capitol. But no one whos seen ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" will think ""Eagle Eye"" does it remotely as well. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2008 Globe Newspaper Company.

Caruso Editor Jim Page Producer Pat Crowley / Alex Kurtzman / Roberto Orci Screenwriter John Glenn / Dan McDermott / Travis Wright / Hillary Seitz The first thing to know about Eagle Eye is that the cold war lasted a lot longer in cinemas than it did on the ground. The black and white scenario perfectly suited the action-spy genre but now weve got the hot war and every second Hollywood film seems to open in a rugged desert somewhere in the Middle East or Afghanistan. And all of the spying is done by this high-tech world wide web of eavesdroppers apparently watching you and me right now. Paranoia about high tech surveillance is at the heart of this thriller.Its directed by JD Caruso whos made a lot of television and also recently Disturbia; its made for Dreamworks and it stars the young it people of the moment Shia LaBeouf who actually does a bit more acting in this than he did in Indiana Jones and Michelle Monaghan who can really act. Which is nice. These two find themselves caught up in what turns out to be a bit if a cross between 2001 Space Odyssey and The Bourne Ultimatum. Its a tad long and it doesnt always add up but the action sequences are pretty visceral and genuinely exciting. If youre riveted by the US presidential race currently Eagle Eye has some suggestions as to how to rid the world of a lame duck president which you might well enjoy.

The paranoid strain in American suspensers proceeds into the terror era with ""Eagle Eye"" a thriller that imagines an all-seeing national government that even the most conspiratorial-minded viewers will see as a tad far-fetched. Hatched some time ago from an uncredited idea by exec producer Steven Spielberg and problematically posited as a present-day actioner (rather than the future-set drama it could plausibly be) the pics first 35 minutes sizzle until a Byzantine plot nudges the story toward near-parody in the final act. Returns should be brawny in a wide-release opening frame but will fade quickly by early October. Taking over what was once a Spielberg directing project helmer D.J. Caruso does more with the film than is offered by the script credited to four writers. Still the pics increasingly chaotic and cockeyed notions of national security overwhelm fine lead perfs by Shia LaBeouf in his first thoroughly adult role as Chi-town slacker Jerry and Michelle Monaghan as Rachel both ensnared in a cyber-conspiracy that seemingly knows no end. A botched U.S. air attack on an Al Qaeda-type suspect carries graver ramifications than the terrorists retaliatory strikes. In apparently unconnected action Jerry holds down a zero job at a copying joint and is late on the rent while Rachel sees her son Sam (Cameron Boyce) off on a trip to music school. Jerry learns the tragic news that his twin brother and decorated Air Force officer Ethan (also LaBeouf seen in brief snippets) has been killed in a bus accident. Suddenly Jerry finds himself as a Hitchcockian wrong man his paltry bank account flush with cash and his apartment crammed with sophisticated weaponry while both he and Rachel receive cell calls from a robotic-sounding female voice ordering them about. Jerrys arrest and interrogation by FBI agent Morgan (Billy Bob Thornton) who suspects he and Ethan are potential terrorists lead to a set of increasingly improbable events that draw liberally on Hitchcocks ""North by Northwest"" and ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" (the later version) as well as a slew of evil computer pics from ""2001"" to ""Colossus The Forbin Project."" Essence of the films paranoid vision is that the Defense Dept. has created an all-seeing computer dubbed ""Aria"" (thus the female voice not credited onscreen though with wads of dialogue) designed to track spy and assess domestic terror risks. This virtual defender in effect has a fit after its recommendations for attacks are overridden and employs ""Project Guillotine"" to target and kill the top 12 U.S. officeholders. Jerry and Rachels roles in all of this are as impossible to swallow as the notion that the same U.S. government that so badly botched the initial attack can create such a thoroughly brilliant and omnipotent device that even high-tech weapons cant defeat. Caruso manages to nudge the excitement along as a way to distract from the narrative nonsense energetically cutting between Jerry and Rachels nonstop cat-and-mouse game with the dogged Morgan and Air Force investigator Zoe (Rosario Dawson solid in a straight-arrow role capped with a laughable action moment) searching for the truth behind Ethans activities and Aria herself. Some messily staged and edited car chases mar an otherwise clean and often subtly staged set of sequences especially an elegant one in the Capitol Building before and during the State of the Union address. Taking on the kind of role Tommy Lee Jones used to do in his sleep Thornton revives it with his personal prickly sensibility. Thesps have the especially difficult job -- most notably LaBoeuf in a cheeky variation on a similar Hitchcock-brand character he played in Carusos ""Disturbia"" -- of looking super-serious when things get absurd. Speilbergian quality and scale of production values and effects abound from a completely convincing underground Pentagon to a fanciful Aria that looks designed by Buckminster Fuller. Darius Wolskis lensing is a huge contribution while Brian Tylers score is blandly generic. Eagle EyeProductionA DreamWorks/Paramount release of a DreamWorks Pictures presentation of a K/O production.

ABOUT THE MOVIEEagle Eye   (out of four)Stars Shia LaBeouf Michelle Monaghan Billy Bob Thornton Rosario DawsonDirector D.J. CarusoDistributor DreamWorks PicturesRating PG-13 for intense sequences of action and adventure and for languageRunning time 1 hour 37 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Eagle Eye is a terrorist thriller that isnt so much suspenseful as overbearing. Though it aspires to be an intriguing political cautionary tale the movie is mostly about the feverish and jarringly choreographed chase scenes. Subtlety doesnt stand a chance as cars plummet off bridges and blow up electrical towers set off massive killer sparks and giant machines wreck everything in their wake. All this mayhem is at the behest of a calm controlled anonymous female who sounds suspiciously like the voice emitted by a standard GPS system. In fact the robotic voice urges the baffled protagonists to turn or head straight in the same tone that it informs them ""Youve been activated."" The words are ominous but also silly coming across a bit like ""You got served."" Shia LaBeouf plays Jerry Shaw an ordinary guy who rather than conform to social expectations drops out of Stanford and backpacks around the world taking odd jobs. Inexplicably Jerry is thrown together with single mom Rachel (Michelle Monaghan) and they become fugitives linked by an ominous series of anonymous phone calls. A maniacal Big Brother is watching via a host of technological devices. Jerry and Rachel must follow the intricate orders of a faceless and omniscient techno-dictator or face certain death. Critical to their odyssey is the advanced and invasive use of such ordinary communication devices as computers neon signs and cellphones as well as some heavy artillery. Despite the storys flaws LaBeouf is engaging playing a now-familiar Everyman. He is maturing into a credible action hero. But Transformers and even the Indiana Jones sequel were better vehicles for him. Monaghan doesnt fare as well spending much of the movie looking befuddled and surprisingly well-groomed given the breakneck chases and brushes with death. Billy Bob Thornton unconvincingly plays an FBI agent uttering most of his lines in a predictable by-the-book fashion. Mostly the plot is mind-numbingly preposterous never stinting on overblown action. The story grows increasingly convoluted and seems to drag before its obvious conclusion. Conversely the chase scenes are edited at such a frenzied pace they could easily induce a seizure. Thorntons character growls to LaBeouf ""This is a bad time to be in the terrorist business."" True enough. But given the limited box office competition and the publics appetite for action films its probably a perfectly fine time for a manic and second-rate terrorist tale.

Ralph Nelson/DreamWorks hide caption toggle caption Ralph Nelson/DreamWorks He has a gun That and the fact that hes played by Billy Bob Thornton is how you know hes a hard case. Ralph Nelson/DreamWorks Idiotic if reasonably kinetic Eagle Eye -- in which Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan spend the better part of two hours urgently answering phone calls and dodging hurtling machinery -- is every bit as over-edited as it is under-thunk. Cobbled together from random elements of far better movies it means to say something about anti-terrorism surveillance and civil liberties. But if you asked me what Eagle Eye is about Id have to say its about as dumb as can be. That said even the not terribly eagle-eyed will spot plot points from George Orwells 1984 Stanley Kubricks 2001 A Space Odyssey Alfred Hitchcocks North By Northwest and a variety of Enemy of the State/Parallax View-style paranoid thrillers about nobodies drafted into assassination schemes. After a brief prologue in the Middle East that will convince most viewers theyve wandered into the wrong movie LaBeouf and Monaghan start getting alarming commands via phone from a woman who can not only see everything they do but can also control everything around them. She knows their weaknesses so she can force their hands when they resist her. And to facilitate their efforts on her behalf she can also re-sequence traffic lights and subway cars and airport conveyor belts send cranes crashing through office windows or car windshields listen in on hushed conversations in wheat fields (through rural power lines) and then turn those same power lines into lethal weapons. Shes a bit of a control freak actually. But when you finally find out who she is and what shes trying to do youll realize that for all the intelligence at her disposal shes hardly a brain trust. (Nor apparently is she an efficiency expert so many are the simpler more obvious ways of accomplishing her missions.) She is in fact ridiculous. And that fact rather reduces the thrill value of the running around everyone is doing at her behest. Which is not to suggest that director D.J. Caruso hasnt flash-edited the hell out of Eagle Eye and pumped it up with ersatz Mission Impossible music in ways calculated to make your heart pound -- and your temples throb.

Those two boys running playfully over the Afghan hills - its The Kite Runner right? Wrong. Its the opening scene of Eagle Eye and those kids are toast. Analysts at the Pentagon back in Washington are tracking a suspected terrorist via satellite - a bin Laden-type whos emerged from his cave to (1) check out a weapons cache or (2) attend a funeral. The guys at Command Center arent sure which but the president goes ahead and orders the smart bombs anyway. In mere minutes thanks to a triangulating network of aerial cameras drone planes and intelligence computer data the town someplace near Kabul goes kaboom. And Eagle Eye heads back to the States for the duration. Another wrong man and wrong woman on-the-run action thriller with a political message and a warehouse worth of high-tech gadgetry Eagle Eye wants to be Marathon Man or Enemy of the State only with a post-9/11 overlay and a plot device lifted straight from 2001 A Space Odyssey. (No spoilers here but anyone remember the usurping HAL?) Shia LeBeouf fresh from fleeing Harrison Fords fedora in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and fleeing extraterrestrial robots in Transformers stars as Jerry Shaw a 23-year-old Stanford dropout (hes smart hes adrift) returned to hometown Chicago. When Jerrys identical twin brother who did something mysterious in the Air Force dies Jerry who works at a copy store suddenly finds himself on the run - yes fleeing - when the FBI swoops down and pegs him as a terrorist. Across town Rachel Holloman (Michelle Monaghan) is a single mom who has just put her young son on a train to D.C. - hes the trumpeter in a school band set to play at the Kennedy Center. Next thing she knows theres a woman on her cell telling Rachel to get in a Porsche Cayenne and drive or else her boys a goner. And the next thing she knows this slacker dude with a scraggly beard has climbed into the passenger seat. Jerrys a total stranger to Rachel but hes been getting these weird calls from a woman on his cell phone too telling him what to do. Long ago a project that Steven Spielberg planned to direct Eagle Eye has been inherited by D.J. Caruso (he steered LeBeouf through Disturbia that nifty Rear Window Jr.). With a bunch of big action set-pieces and a cast that includes Billy Bob Thornton (FBI guy) Rosario Dawson (Air Force intel) Michael Chiklis (secretary of defense) and the disembodied voice of Julianne Moore (disembodied voice) the movie makes next to no sense plotwise. Why Jerry? Why Rachel? Whos the desperate foreign dude who stole her sons trumpet? What Eagle Eye wants to do is show us technologys dark side all the stuff thats there to make our lives easier - ATMs PDAs iPods GPS cell phones PCs ""smart"" houses - turned against us in a vast conspiracy. A vast conspiracy to do what? you ask. A vast conspiracy to get Shia LeBeouf fleeing across the screen delivering his lines on the run an out-of-control tractor-trailer bearing down fast behind him.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Comments Eagle Eye Working in the finest tradition of brain-dead blockbusters director D.J. Caruso (Disturbia) and executive producer Steven Spielberg take a script riddled with absurdities and throw millions and millions of dollars at it. Two Chicagoans who dont know each other (Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan) are coerced into carrying out a terrorism plot by a mysterious and omnipotent organization that communicates with them by cell phones manipulates their movements with split-second timing and controls almost every electrical device in their path from security cameras to traffic lights to the scrolling LED screen in a travel office window. Caruso and Spielberg probably thought they were reviving the paranoid style of 70s political thrillers but their story is so implausible it barely provokes a tremor. With Billy Bob Thornton Michael Chiklis Rosario Dawson and Anthony Mackie. PG-13. By J.R.

Caruso teamed with Shia LaBeouf on the thriller Disturbia which felt a lot like Rear Window. The two join forces again for Eagle Eye which recalls both Enemy of the State and Live Free or Die Hard. Apparently originality isnt the duos strong point. Then again when the finished product is this much fun whos complaining? In Eagle Eye a scruffy LaBeouf plays Jerry Shaw an aimless 20-something who works at a printing-supply shop as a copy boy - ""Im a copy associate"" he insists when describing the job. He returns home one evening to find his apartment filled with the kind of supplies a terrorist would use. Then theres the matter of his bank account which is suddenly fatter by 750000. After discovering the supplies he gets a call on his cellphone An unidentified woman advises him to escape or he will be arrested. He doesnt heed the warning and gets picked up by the FBI. Single mom Rachel Holloman (winsome Michelle Monaghan from Made of Honor) lands in her own nightmarish situation. Her son is on a train trip to Washington D.C. and shes spending the evening with friends at a bar. A phone call from the same woman informs her to immediately drive away or her son will be killed. The unseen caller brings the strangers together then turns them into fugitives who keep getting pushed into new situations each more dangerous than the last. The motive is somehow tied to terrorism and Jerrys twin brother an Air Force officer who recently was killed. The movie effectively plays on our reliance of technology. Wherever Rachel and Jerry go theyre tracked by the caller through security cameras computers GPS systems and cellphones. Its a rattling premise that has been used effectively in other films and it works here too. The movie also boasts a kicky sense of humor. In one sequence a sign with scrolling letters instructs Jerry to leap out of a building. When he looks at it incredulously the sign reiterates ""Yes Jerry jump"" LaBeouf and Monaghan make you believe that these people are thrown into these unbelievable situations. Even when something outlandish occurs youre still so involved with the characters that you want to see how theyll get out of each hair-raising predicament. Caruso is equally masterful with the action sequences. A car chase in which an FBI agent (Billy Bob Thornton) pursues the duo is over-the-top exciting with fast edits and dizzying camerawork. Theres also a breathless sequence on an airport conveyer belt as the two are pursued by both the FBI and cameras that track their moves. The motivations of the caller are a bit overly involved; its the kind of movie that probably shouldnt be examined too closely. Still strip the film down to its core and you have a tale about two ordinary likable people manipulated into dangerous situations by a presence they dont understand or recognize. Its a compelling setup that manages to be both ominous and fun making this a popcorn thriller with an edge. Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

"Movie review Eagle Eye -- 3 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Eagle Eye -- 3 out of 5 stars Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Far-fetched fast-moving locked and overloaded Eagle Eye is what happens when you give the people who made a success of the modestly budgeted Disturbia a blank check. The fever-pitch paranoia of this terrorist thriller the seizure-inducing editing the dense layers slapped on a fairly simple plot all point to a kind of overkill that only Hollywood money can buy.Jerry whos young and way too smart for his starvation-wage Copy Cabana job checks his ATM and discovers hundreds of thousands of dollars in his account. He opens the door to his dump of an apartment to see military ordnance and the makings of an Oklahoma City bomb. His cell phone rings. ""The F.B.I. will be there in 30 seconds."" And bang Eagle Eye is off like a rifle shot. The Feds catch the guy but the all-seeing/all-knowing terrorist making the call springs him. How all-seeing/all-knowing? Able to change traffic lights and electronic billboards set off alarms inflate airbags derail trains or short-out power lines at will able to track Jerry wherever he goes by phone by surveillance camera. And whoever it is theyve blackmailed others into the same scheme. Thats how Rachel a single mom (Michelle Monaghan) meets him. Her sons in danger. The two strangers are sent on a wild odyssey not knowing where theyre going what theyre doing or who theyre doing this for.Director D.J. Caruso and star Shia LaBeouf leaned heavily on Hitchcocks Rear Window for Disturbia -- so heavily that theyve been sued by the copyright holders of that story. They dont make the same mistake here. The movie may start as a riff on Hitchcocks mistaken identity/pawn-in-plot thriller North By Northwest. But it borrows just as heavily from The Fugitive (with Billy Bob Thornton in the Tommy Lee Jones role) and a couple of other techno-thrillers that I wont divulge. Theres no time for character development barely a pause to catch our breath or consider how plausible all this is or even that theres a ticking clock here -- an event or series of events that must be prevented by means we cant figure out due to the heart-racing pace of the piece.Which means that Eagle Eye isnt a bad movie its just too cluttered too derivative. The best thrillers Hitchcock taught us begin with characters we embrace and then add devices (MacGuffins) pace and plot. Here our Hitchcock thieves started with the MacGuffin shortchanged the characters and gave us a plot you dont have to be an Eagle Eye to figure out way before the credits.

Caruso; Author John Glenn Dan McDermott Hillary Seitz Travis Wright; Release Date Wide 09/26/2008; MPAA Rating PG-13 Posted October 3 2008 -- 1200 AM EDT George Orwells preposterous declaration in 1984 has come true Big Brother is watching me and you and everyone we know documenting us on surveillance cameras capturing our cell phone Internet and AT M activity and tracking our whereabouts as we drive hybrid vehicles outfitted with satellite guidance systems. So Eagle Eye a brain-squandering thriller starring Shia LaBeouf Michelle Monaghan and cell phones they insist upon answering is onto something with its future-is-now premise of ordinary citizens blackmailed by infernal technology. But the movie (which began as a byte of an idea from exec producer Steven Spielberg) is so hysterical in its terrorist subplot and its seizure-inducing action sequences that a pummeled viewer can be excused for texting WTF? to a friend in the middle of the chaos. Especially when the commands come from an unseen female mastermind with the voice of a GPS console reciting driving directions. (Sometimes she flashes additional info via electronic signage -- like Steve Martin did for laffs in L.A. Story.) LaBeouf and Monaghan grimace and run fast as ordinary citizens snared (by ludicrous circumstances) into abetting the enemy; Billy Bob Thornton and Rosario Dawson evince similar mood swings as FBI agents. But none is charismatic enough to override the prattlings of Eagle Eye herself or to jolt us into realizing that this movie actually means to say serious stuff We can run but we cant hide.
