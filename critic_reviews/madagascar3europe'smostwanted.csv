"Madagascar 3 (PG) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Madagascar 3 (PG) Screenwriter Noah Baumbach (""The Squid and the Whale"") helps elevate this third installment in the talking-animal series to wonderful heights. Share Print Save to your profile By Colin Covert McClatchy News Service6/7/2012 Editor rating 3.5 Madagascar 3 Europes Most Wanted is one of the fanciest most carefully assembled cartoons ever put on the screen. The jokes come so fast theyre nearly subliminal. Plot points whiz by and when things threaten to blur theres a crazy musical number or a tightly worked out physical comedy routine involving a hippo or a penguin. Then its back on the bullet train. Your brain goes breathless and giddy struggling to keep up. Like Madagascar 2 this one begins right where the previous story left off. Alex the lion (voiced by Ben Stiller) Marty the zebra (Chris Rock) Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) and the rest of the refugees from the Central Park Zoo are still stranded in Africa and yearning to get back where they belong. The rickety monkey-built plane from the last installment achieves liftoff but the avaricious penguins and vainglorious King Julien the lemur (Sacha Baron Cohen) are as usual infuriating double-crossers and our heroes are left to their own devices. With faultless cartoon logic the menagerie scuba-dives to Monaco where they make a shambles of the famed casino. With animal control officer Capt. Chantel DuBois (Frances McDormand) in hot pursuit they hide in a traveling circus meeting new characters including Vitaly (Bryan Cranston) a growling heavy-souled Siberian tiger. As the circus tours Rome and London the film has plenty of broad fun with European stereotypes. Capt. DuBois is the mirror image of the ineffectual gendarme pursuing the runaway animals with ninja-like agility and tenacity a Terminator would admire. Shes still French to the core though breaking into an extended Edith Piaf routine that will tickle kids even if they dont get the context. There are a couple of funny cross-species love affairs. Baron Cohens lemur flips for the circuss unicycle star a plump tutu-clad grizzly bear. The script by indie filmmaker Noah Baumbach (The Squid and the Whale Fantastic Mr. Fox) adds a creative off-kilter vibe that sets the cartoon apart from Madagascars animated peers. Its not every writer who would see the comic potential of putting those mismatched lovers in ravishingly romantic Roman vistas with Andrea Bocelli warbling love songs. It kills. Gia (Jessica Chastain) a flirtatious leopard with eyes for Alex is a wonderful new addition. Shes a very sensuous nubile feline. After some kittenish shenanigans he impatiently asks her ""Are you 5?"" She replies ""Yes"" leaving us in the audience to do swift mental calculations from cat years to human to assure ourselves shes not underage. Then you realize youre fretting over moral peril to a cat. A cartoon cat. A circus contract that could being the animals back to America sets up the finale a whirligig spectacle of acrobatic teamwork to the tune of Katy Perrys Firework that ends the movie on a delirious high note. This one is almost too good to leave to the children. Voices Ben Stiller Chris Rock Jada Pinkett Smith Frances McDormand Jessica Chastain Sacha Baron Cohen. Directors Eric Darnell Tom McGrath Conrad Vernon. Screenwriters Eric Darnell Noah Baumbach. Producer Mark Swift. A DreamWorks Animation release. Running time 85 minutes. Mild rude humor.

(DreamWorks Animation) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday June 7 2012 158 PM Title Madagascar 3 Film Info PG. Area theaters. Early in ""Madagascar 3 Europes Most Wanted"" Alex the lion again voiced by Ben Stiller appreciates a mini-Times Square made for him by his pals Marty the zebra (Chris Rock) Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer) and Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith). Smiling wistfully at the town his friends have re-created out of sand Alex grins at the thought of ""Times Square with its modern corporate lack of character"" Um Alex? That pretty much describes the movie youre in. Seven years after this foursome escaped from the Central Park zoo and landed off the coast of Africa ingeniousness in this third ""Madagascar"" is even harder to find than old 42nd St. Worried he and his friends will turn old without ever seeing their beloved zoo again Alex decides they should follow the tough-guy penguins whove hot-wired a plane and headed to Monte Carlo. Easy-peasy. A few minutes later the action moves to a casino where the erudite monkey Mason and King Julian the lemur (Sasha Baron Cohen) cause mischief. After a ruckus the animals attract the attention of an animal control officer named Dubois (Frances McDormand). She collects animal heads and now wants Alexs. Alexs head however is busy hatching schemes. Finding a shabby traveling circus Alex Melman Marty and Gloria pose as performers to hitch a ride on the carnival train. There they meet the surly Russian tiger Vitaly (Bryan Cranston) the ooh-la feline Gia (Jessica Chastain) and the blubbery Italian sea lion Stefano (Martin Short) who hopes Alexs ideas can update their shtick. King Julian romances a bear. Despite a script co-written by Noah Baumbach ""Madagascar 3"" cant upgrade its own shtick becoming a craven example of a fast-buck no-fun family film. Emotionally the characters are stuck where they were in the first film and its 2008 sequel. Marty plays up his stripes by wearing a rainbow afro wig. Alex helps put on a good show. The sniveling Melman walks a tightrope. Meanwhile Stefano -- one of the more annoying creations in recent animation despite Shorts vocal gymnastics -- is shot out of a cannon. Actually all the new additions are sideshow freaks. The weirdly curvy girl-faced Gia is like a Humanimal from ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" and Vitaly is a knife-throwing Russian heavy. Baumbachs big idea -- to make Dubois an Edith Piaf-singing grotesquerie whose angular cheekbones and nasty mien honor the edgier animation made overseas -- could scare young audiences who may be unsure if Alex being chased by a knife-wielding Frenchwoman is cute. Even the penguins sound bored in ""Madagascar 3"" and thats saying something. Or to quote a penguin line from the first film ""Well this sucks.""

Directed by Eric Darnell Tom McGrath and Conrad Vernon. Starring the voices of Ben Stiller and Chris Rock. (PG. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The ""Madagascar"" movies have never exactly moved at a snails pace and theyre hardly realistic. But something curious happens with the speed-freaking ""Madagascar 3 Europes Most Wanted"" our latest journey with the kibitzing New York zoo creatures. Even within the rules of its own peculiar world - a world well stocked with talking savanna denizens and monkey-powered superplanes - the film is completely irrational. If it were live action had a smaller budget and featured bandit-masked Swedes with metronomes it might be interpreted as some high-minded exercise in impish filmic absurdism. When we last saw our anthropomorphic Zoo Yorkers Alex the Lion (voiced by Ben Stiller) Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock) Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) and Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) were prepping for a stay in Africa while the penguins flew off to Monte Carlo in the aforementioned primate-powered air transport. ""Madagascar 3"" now finds the African contingent bored cranky and sorely missing the island of Manhattan. They want to go home. They cant without the penguins. Where are those fellas? Still in Monaco. How to get there? Swim. Which is cute especially the glimpse of Alex amp; Co. in snorkeling gear but it makes you wonder If they can doggy paddle to France from an undisclosed location somewhere along the enormous coast of Africa why couldnt they just swim to New York City? Once in Monte Carlo the plot involves a circus train an embittered Siberian tiger (Bryan Cranston) and a psycho French cop (Frances McDormand) who crawls around on all fours on a mission to sniff out Alex. Also in the mix is a drooling bear-lemur hook-up that is more unnervingly transgressive than the penguin-bobblehead romance in ""Madagascar Escape 2 Africa."" The films 3-D animation pops with neon colors and gymnastic flights of fancy that turn progressively wilder weirder and less coherent as the story unfolds. Its not just eye candy; it looks as if someone did violence to an entire supermarket aisle full of jellied fruit slices. The screenplay by Eric Darnell and Noah Baumbach churns out the snappy witticisms with admirable creative gusto but it whizzes along at such a frenetic pace that youll probably miss half of them.

"What a trip Madagascar 3 has most fun since pink elephants were on parade |       NJ.com comments What a trip Madagascar 3 has most fun since pink elephants were on parade Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on June 08 2012 at 748 AM View/Post Comments DreamWorks Animation Its not just human stars who have to worry about scene stealers in Hollywood. Cartoon animals have to beware too. The first ""Madagascar"" (2005) introduced us to four Central Park Zoo denizens -- a vain lion a kooky zebra a hypochondriac giraffe and a dont-mess-with-me hippo -- who were feeling a little penned up. The jokes came from a plot that took these jaded New Yorkers out of Gotham and put them in an exotic wild they were in no way prepared for. It was a fun idea but the characters remained sketchy. Which gave the supporting beasts their chance. Ben Stiller Chris Rock David Schwimmer and Jada Pinkett Smith remained the in-voice-only stars of the cartoon. But the real attractions became the extra oddball beasts including the slightly insane lemur king Julien and a crew of gung-ho penguins. They return here along with a few new characters -- a sexy Italian jaguar a dour Russian tiger a sea lion who seems to be channeling Roberto Benigni and a crazed French animal-control officer. And while they push the four main characters further into the background they make this a fun and fast family entertainment. The story which picks up in Africa where the last sequel left off is a little haphazard moving the plot forward illogically. When our four animal friends need to go to Monte Carlo for example they simply swim there. (From Africa?) Trying to get home and rich with casino winnings they buy a traveling circus. (Why not just buy four passages on a trans-Atlantic freighter?) Yes I know asking for realism in a movie about talking animals is a bit much. But lapses like this arent a matter of wild fantasy; theyre the result of lazy writers who cant be bothered connecting the dots. The new characters though are wonderfully drawn particularly the tres French functionary in pursuit a mass of grimaces and geometry (and voiced surprisingly by Frances McDormand). Terrific too are Jessica Chastains slinky big cat and Martin Shorts slap-happy sea lion. The film does stumble a couple of times including a strange pause for ""Non Je Ne Regrette Rien."" (Yeah nothing really delights the small fry like a big Edith Piaf number.) But the film soon picks up again. And at its heart -- the animals jazzy circus performance done in black-light colors and set to a Katy Perry song -- may be one of the trippiest scenes in a mainstream kiddie movie since Dumbo saw those pink elephants. The ending wraps things up neatly suggesting the series is now concluded. No offense but lets hope so. Julien and the penguins have kept these films going far longer than the first episode suggested was possible and while this outing is still fine theres no use beating a dead horse. Or even a cartoon zebra. Ratings note The film contains some mildly gross humor. Madagascar 3 Europes Most Wanted (PG) DreamWorks Animation (95 min.) Directed by Eric Darnell Tom McGrath and Conrad Vernon. With the voices of Ben Stiller Chris Rock David Schwimmer Jada Pinkett Smith. Now playing in New Jersey.

JENNIE PUNTER Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 08 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Jun. 07 2012 406PM EDT Comments AA Directed by Eric Darnell Tom McGrath and Conrad Vernon Written by Eric Darnell and Noah Baumbach Starring (Voices) Ben Stiller Chris Rock David Schwimmer Jada Pinkett Smith Sacha Baron Cohen Cedric the Entertainer Andy Richter Frances McDormand Bryan Cranston Martin Short and Jessica Chastain Classification G Country USA Language English The wise-cracking globe-trotting crew from the Central Park Zoo hit the big screen again in Madagascar 3 a full-throttle often surreal and definitely unhinged adventure across Europe via train in the company of a traveling circus. The critters main goal is to return to Manhattan. But as you can imagine they gotta jump through a lot of hoops. Multimedia Madagascar 3 - Trailer The third instalment in the successful DreamWorks Animation franchise is directed by Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath (the same couple of monkeys who helmed the first two movies) and Conrad Vernon (Monsters Vs. Aliens). Darnell penned the snappy screenplay with writer-director Noah Baumbach (The Squid and the Whale) who adapted Roald Dahls The Fantastic Mr. Fox with director Wes Anderson.But the clever lines and themes of friendship and finding home are almost completely overwhelmed here by the breathless pace and sensory overload enhanced by frequent sprays of candy-coloured circus action and the gravity-defying 3D treatment which should probably come with a motion-sickness warning - especially for the gulp trapeze scenes.The opening scene of Madagascar 3 almost feels like an alternative ending to the previous film which closed with Alex the lion (Ben Stiller) Marty the zebra (Chris Rock) Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmeer) Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) and lemur King Julien XIII (Sacha Baron Cohen) comfortably settling in to their new home in the African savannah as their penguin and chimp pals take off for Monte Carlo in a souped-up helicopter.But the new friends and family that surrounded Alex and his pals in the last movie are nowhere to be seen here. After the penguins depart at warp speed the rest of the gang snorkels across the Mediterranean to begin Operation Penguin Extraction in Monte Carlo where the crafty penguins - who always have an array of high-tech gadgets handy - are cleaning up at the casino. All Alex wants is to convince the penguins to pilot the gang home to Manhattan but their highly conspicuous entrance raises the alarm and soon Capt. Dubois (Frances McDormand) an evil French animal-control officer is hot on their trail.After a speedy and spectacular chase across the rooftops of Monte Carlo the helicopter crash-lands and the animals hop on board a departing circus train where they pass themselves off as ""circus folk"" to a troupe of pan-European animal performers who have definitely seen better days. A tired and disastrous show at Romes Colisseum causes a riot. Clearly this troupe needs a new approach and Alex is just the lion with the can-do spirit to inspire them.Although the beautifully rendered and detailed city backdrops in Monte Carlo Rome and London are an animation revelation the new crew of Euro characters follow familiar cliches - the curvaceous Italian jaguar Gia (Jessica Chastain) the clownish Italian sea lion Stefano (Martin Short) a pack of thuggish British dogs and the brooding Borcht-slurping Siberian tiger Vitaly (Bryan Cranston) the most appealing of the bunch with an odd backstory involving olive oil and flaming-hoop trick.As a villainess Dubois moves like a cross between a black widow spider and a bloodhound - but like so much with the film her character is all about the visual. And her Edith Piaf number intended to rouse her injured team and get laughs from the audience falls flat.There are some dark corners that could be pretty frightening to younger kids - the scene when the lemurs find themselves in a train compartment filled with dangling chains and hooks looks like something from a torture horror flick. And Dubois attempts to kill Alex rather than just capture him feel uneccesarily violent.But all you have to do is blink and the bad parts are gone. Madagascar 3 Europes Most Wanted is all about speed and razzle-dazzle building to an eye-popping over-the-big-top finale that leaves you wondering what they could possibly do for an encore.Special to The Globe and Mail Report Typo/Error Follow us on Twitter GlobeArts Comments AA In the know Life This woman became a middle-age man magnet.

Photo EPA Describing this as the ""best"" of the abysmal animated ""Madagascar trilogy is like indicating a slight preference for being locked in a sweatbox instead of waterboarded Either way you feel enormous gratitude when its over. What might be barely tolerable in a seven-minute short gave me the biggest headache since ""Transformers Dark of the Moon. This is an exhausting eyeball-gougingly ugly 90-minute assault of non-stop action with an all-star voice cast shouting witless lines and a wide variety of objects lobbed at the audience in the crudest 3-D fashion. Ben Stiller -- who returns as the lead voice of a neurotic cowardly lion -- recruited his ""Greenberg director Noah Baumbach to collaborate on the minimalist script which was apparently composed on a cocktail napkin. But dont go expecting another ""Fantastic Mr. Fox which Baumbach co-wrote with Wes Anderson. Its cliche central as the displaced Central Park Zoo animals -- annoyingly voiced by Chris Rock Jada Pinkett Smith and David Schwimmer -- follow their monkey and penguin companions to Monte Carlo where they hope to break the bank to finance a trip home. This basically amounts to a feature-long chase by a fanatical French animal-control officer (Frances McDormand) -- the filmmakers dont seem to realize Monaco is a separate country -- that leads all the way back to the United States. First though the animals try to elude her by buying a traveling circus allowing DreamWorks Animation to employ Bryan Cranston Jessica Chastain and Martin Short to voice a tiger jaguar and sea lion that are added to this motley menagerie. ""Madagascar 3 Europes Most Wanted concludes with an interminable Central Park performance that looks suspiciously like an extended plug for distributor Paramounts forthcoming Cirque du Soleil movie.

Starring Ben Stiller Chris Rock David Schwimmer Jada Pinkett Smith Director Eric Darnell Conrad Vernon Release Opened Jun 8 2012  Editorial Review A big top curtain call of the wildBy Michael OSullivanFriday June 8 2012The increasingly tenuous connection of each successive ""Madagascar"" movie to the franchises original premise -- homesick New York zoo animals at large in a scary world -- is stretched pretty thin in ""Madagascar 3 Europes Most Wanted."" And that is a very good thing. A very very good thing. The third outing in the popular series of animated adventures about Alex the lion (voice of Ben Stiller) Marty the zebra (Chris Rock) Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer) and Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) may be the best of the bunch simply because it busts the leash that tethers it to anything resembling reality. The level of divine lunacy it aspires to is signaled early on. To escape from Monaco -- where our heroes have traveled from Africa searching for the airplane they hope will take them home -- an order is given to shake the Monte Carlo animal control officer who is determined to stop them from leaving ""Deploy banana gun."" That the order is issued by a talking penguin to a mute chimpanzee is funny enough. But the fact that the animal control officer is played by Frances McDormand doing a deliciously silly French accent and that her character then engages in a slo-mo series of ""Matrix""-style bullet-time banana-dodging is absolutely sublime. And it only goes uphill from there. ""Madagascar 3 Europes Most Wanted"" may be the best use of 3-D animation weve seen since ""Up."" Structured around a prolonged yet picturesque chase that takes Alex and company from Monaco to France to Italy to England -- all the while pursued by McDormands Inspector-Javert-like Captain DuBois -- its a story that lends itself naturally to visual-enhancement technology. It doesnt hurt that most of the action takes place in a traveling circus where the fugitives decide to hide from DuBois. The antics of a hoop-jumping tiger named Vitaly (Bryan Cranston) Gia the jaguar (Jessica Chastain) and Stefano the sea-lion cannonball (Martin Short) contribute mightily to sequences of amazing animation some in eye-popping neon that rival those of Disneys 1940 classic ""Fantasia."" Yes its that good. The film is also pretty hilarious thanks mainly to DuBois who like an angry Energizer bunny just keeps going and going and going. A lot of the credit also must go to veteran ""Madagascar"" screenwriter Eric Darnell who is here joined by writer Noah Baumbach (""The Fantastic Mr. Fox""). Their script isnt just funny its fun. A parade of laughs? That you expect. Whats really surprising about ""Madagascar 3"" is just how moving it ultimately is largely because of the emotionally engaging character animation. A tricycle-riding bear named Sonya -- who never speaks just growls plaintively -- is a case in point. Her unlikely romance with Sacha Baron Cohens Julien the lemur king (of course hes back) is actually kind of . . . sweet. So is the movie. Its a kids Cirque de Soleil for a lot less money.

Set at a frenzied pace meant to connote fun it mostly feels like a frenetic spectacle.The notion of transplanted city zoo animals in the wilds of Africa had worn thin in 2008s Madagascar Escape 2 Africa (the sequel to 2005s charming original where they landed on the titular island). This installment finds the scrappy quartet of Manhattan zoo denizens leaving Madagascar for Monte Carlo following after their monkey and penguin pals who sailed there on a gambling holiday. The big-city foursome cover plenty of European ground joining forces with a traveling circus.MORE Next stop Europe for Madagascar crewVIDEO Madagascar 3 premieres at Cannes Film FestivalMORE Latest news reviews of all things film at USA TODAY MoviesAlex the lion (Ben Stiller) is the leader of his zoo buddies gabby zebra Marty (Chris Rock) sassy hippo Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith) and neurotic giraffe Melman (David Schwimmer). Also along for the adventures -- as in the last sequel -- are a gaggle of penguins and a babbling lemur known as King Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen) who falls in love with a giant bear on a bicycle in an enjoyably loopy segment.This franchise has its inherent appeal. The series continues to focus on the value of friendships new and old and on imagination and resourcefulness. But the films antic loud style and rather dull plot isnt likely to bowl over kids. Jokes about Cirque du Soleil and Mia Farrow are likely to sail right over young heads. On the other hand a reference to a ""stinky poopy circus"" while hardly clever should make some of the youngest moviegoers chortle.About the movieMadagascar 3 Europes Most Wanted1/2 out of fourStars Ben Stiller Chris Rock Jada Pinkett Smith Sacha Baron Cohen David Schwimmer Martin Short Cedric the Entertainer Director Eric Darnell and Tom McGrathDistributor Paramount Pictures Rating PG for some mild action and rude humor Running time 1 hour 33 minutes Opens Friday nationwideBits of songs from the original are reprised though their initial silly charm is waning.Some of the acrobatic circus feats lend themselves to the 3-D format such as animals pulling off trapeze stunts high-diving and sailing through the air with fireworks as a backdrop. But mostly it feels like a studio cashing in on the ubiquitous trend.Now that the franchise has covered three continents can this mean there are four more movies in Madgascars future? Theres a big world available but it might help if the filmmakers allow the critters to slow down and enjoy the journey. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Credit DreamWorks Animation/Paramount Pictures The humor is similar but the scale is bigger faster and brighter in ""Madagascar 3 Europes Most Wanted"" this summers installment in DreamWorks Animations billion-dollar-grossing franchise. The images styled after Miroslav Saseks illustrations still charm and the movies returning directors Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath keep their machine humming. A third director Conrad Vernon has joined them perhaps to accommodate the heightened pyrotechnics.The principals (Ben Stiller voicing Alex the leader lion; Chris Rock as Marty the effusive zebra; Jada Pinkett Smith as the ungainly Gloria the hippo; and David Schwimmer as the neurotic Melman the giraffe) also cruise comfortably benefiting from their usual solid and abundant support including the quasi-military penguin squad (stars of their own TV series) and Sacha Baron Cohen as the lemur King Julien.The story -- the four join a European circus to escape a predatory French animal-control official (a delightful Frances McDormand) literally after Alexs head -- has them leaving Africa for Monaco the Swiss Alps Rome London and New York. And meeting a gruff tiger Vitaly (Bryan Cranston); a spry jaguar Gia (Jessica Chastain); and a garrulous sea lion Stefano (Martin Short). Alex flirts with Gia while Julien romances Sonya a bear. (Gloria and Melman hooked up in ""M2."") Life lessons in the script (partly by Noah Baumbach Mr. Stillers ""Greenberg"" director) are desultory but a late twist is surprising.Where ""Madagascar 3"" soars is in its visuals A Monte Carlo chase is vertiginously madcap; a Cirque du Soleil-style spectacle dazzles with rich pastels; the 3-D effects have wit and invention. Kids will be stimulated. And parents youll enjoy the sights.""Madagascar 3"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Some inoffensive ribaldry rocketing by at light speed.

There they must fight a terrifying battle to save the future of the human race. Video courtesy of 20th Century Fox. By Joe Morgenstern June 7 2012 512 p.m. ET Ridley Scott has been quoted as saying that fans of ""Alien"" will recognize strands of its DNA in ""Prometheus."" Theyre impossible to miss both in the brilliant visuals and in some aspects of the plot. Yet his new film suffers from crucial chromosome breaks. What was then a model of narrative clarity and seductive suspense--""In space no one can hear you scream""--is now diffuse and often assaultive. In part that reflects the evolving priorities of the movie business in the intervening three decades. ""Prometheus"" in efficient 3-D places most of its bets on the wonders that todays visual artists and technicians can work with digital tools. This tale of an interstellar search asks cosmic questions about the meaning of life but comes up with lame answers in a script that screams attention-deficit disorder. ENLARGE Michael Fassbender in Prometheus. Twentieth Century Fox The searchers venture forth in a spaceship named after the Greek god who stole fire from Zeus and gave it to us mortals. Prometheus is owned by a vastly powerful corporation called Weyland Industries--that makes the vessel a kind of private Enterprise--and its diverse crew promises the pleasures of good pulp while that distinctive DNA promises the revulsion of gloppy gelatin. Two of the people on board are archaeologists Noomi Rapaces Shaw and her boyfriend Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green); they smooch when they can and tap helmets tenderly during extravehicular excursions. Theyre the ones whove persuaded Weyland to bankroll the mission on the basis of cave drawings that suggest the human race was created by higher beings--the archaeologists call them Engineers--and that specify a point in space as the workshop of these gods. Its a lot to infer from simple pictograms but Google Maps doesnt cover the territory. Ms. Rapace the singular Swedish star who played Lisbeth Salander in the Millennium Trilogy works hard and well on this movies behalf; shes never less than intense and a prodigy of endurance when she cranks up Shaws intensity to fever pitch. Charlize Therons Meredith Vickers represents Weylands interests. Severe in demeanor and tailored to perfection in outfits that suggest late 21st-century Armani Vickers is the ships Nurse Ratched. Shes meant to be mysterious with her own agenda but you wish shed lighten up and stop behaving like a robot. (At one point theres a suggestion that shes about to let loose although inexplicably we never get to see it happen.) Related Video Michael Fassbenders David is a robot and he steals the show. The theft is accomplished by a combination of smart writing and Mr. Fassbenders delectably minimalist technique. David is a walking smiling outwardly self-assured HAL who may have an agenda of his own. Possessed of childlike curiosity he studies Peter OToole in a video of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" for life lessons on how to behave. (""The trick William Potter is not minding that it hurts."") It says more than the filmmakers could have intended--Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof wrote the ragged script--that the movies most appealing character is a piece of machinery. This is because the pulp archetypes of human persuasion fall victim to excessive dumbing down--some of the scientists like the crew headed by Idris Elbas Janek talk like middle-school dropouts--or to stultifying self-seriousness. Shaw is a believer keeping her crucifix close for as long as she can and looking forward to meeting her literal maker. Holloway is a debunker unimpressed by the majesty of creation. The issues they debate hardly lack spiritual resonance (why did the Engineers make us and who made them?) but theyre debated so schematically and punched up so opportunistically (Shaw is sterile unable to create life herself) that the story seems to have been bolted together by engineering apprentices. Thats certainly not true of the deep-space vistas; theyre as soul-filling as the most ardent fan of ""Alien"" could have hoped for. (The deep-bass sound design is impressive too.) ""Prometheus"" is worth seeing for the quality of its sci-fi sights and not just the great outdoors in the far reaches of the cosmos. Mr. Scott and his collaborators--most notably the production designer Arthur Max and the cinematographer Dariusz Wolski--have created data-rich interiors with 3-D displays shimmering holograms and in one magical scene a sort of planetarium of the cosmos that springs up unbidden with a little Earth drifting around the perimeter. The director pioneered data richness in ""Blade Runner"" the now-peerless classic of future noir cum urban grunge. Here though theres a sense of randomness and too-muchness that characterizes the whole production including the hideous creatures that fulfill the promise of a horror show. They keep popping up in more forms with more lethal strategies than a besieged Earth brain can compute. The same too-muchness afflicts the action which is disorganized or preposterous when it isnt frenzied what with scientists wandering off heedlessly and touching stuff with reckless abandon. (They should have watched a video of ""Alien"" for lessons in how to behave.) The climax is spectacular yet the movies high point--which may also be the low point depending on your squeamishness level--is a ruthlessly clever sequence that the most ardent pro-life advocate might find justified in principle though appalling in fact. Thats followed by Shaw running around the spaceship like Medea on uppers. The running takes place in narrative limbo since no one else on the spaceship seems aware of her plight and she stumbles on a pivotal secret through an open door that should by the logic of the plot have been sealed and triple-locked. Yet this is the way things happen in ""Prometheus."" A movie about biology and life its all but devoid of connective tissue. Spoiled by their upbringing with no idea what wild life is really like four animals from New York Citys Central Park Zoo escape unwittingly assisted by four absconding penguins and find themselves in Madagascar among a bunch of merry lemurs. Video courtesy of Paramount Pictures. Madagascar 3 Europes Most Wanted Say what you will about the ""Madagascar"" franchise--and Ive said my share of skeptical things about the perfunctory plots--millions of people around the world have followed the exploits of the Central Park Zoo escapees and theyll surely turn out again. This third chapter in 3-D relocates its heroes from Africa to Monte Carlo where theyre pursued by a rabid animal-control officer. To evade her they join a broken-down traveling circus that takes them to Rome and London; along the way they help the dejected circus animals rediscover their passion. This plot is better than perfunctory--it plays on a classic theme of irrepressible Americans breathing new life into weary Europe. Whats striking this time is the perfunctory physics. ENLARGE A scene from Madagascar 3 Europes Most Wanted. DreamWorks Animation has always meant liberation from Newtonian constraints; elephants fly fragile creatures survive fierce collisions. Still cartoons have acknowledged those constraints in approximate ways; a squirrel does fall after soaring up and off a glaciers roller-coaster surface. ""Madagascar 3"" doesnt just bend the laws of physics it creates kinetic chaos by ignoring them and diminishes its impact in the process. Heres an example. The former star of the traveling circus a tiger named Vitaly has lost his nerve after an accident. Hes no longer able to perform his signature stunt leaping through a flaming ring the size of a wedding band. But how could he ever have done it? The stunt is patently impossible even in the carefree language of cartoons so its hard to be impressed when Vitaly finds the courage to do it again. And more to the point the stunt forces the animators to cheat; they can only show it from Vitalys perspective not from an objective point of view that might have given it some validity. In one sense this is a flea-size quibble; cartoons can do what they damned well please. But drama demands constraints; if theres nothing to push against physically as well as emotionally then nothings at stake. ""Madagascar 3"" is all about exuberant motion cute characters and gorgeous colors. It aims for the eyes not the heart. An uptight NYC lawyer takes her two teenagers to her hippie mothers farmhouse upstate for a family vacation. Video courtesy of IFC Films. Peace Love amp; Misunderstanding This childish comedy of conflicting values set mostly in contemporary Woodstock and directed by Bruce Beresford plays like a list of hippie cliches that must be included lest any trace of reality intrude. Wind chimes chime generic protesters demand peace in unspecified nations an ancient VW Beetle vies for screen time with a battered VW Microbus and everything but the village green is tie-dyed. The only rewards and they are real albeit insufficient involve watching Jane Fonda in full cry and Catherine Keener in a quieter fullness of feeling. Ms. Keener is Diane a conservative Manhattan lawyer. Newly wounded by her husbands demand for a divorce she packs her two kids into the car--theyre played by Elizabeth Olsen and Nat Wolff--and beats a retreat to the Catskills for a brief visit with her mother Ms. Fondas Grace. With her earth-mother mother that is. Happily stuck in the counterculture 60s Grace grows pot in the basement allows chickens free range in the kitchen takes generic studs to her bedroom or living-room couch and leaves no room for doubt about why Diane has avoided her for 20 years. ENLARGE Elizabeth Olsen Jane Fonda and Catherine Keener in Peace Love amp; Misunderstanding. IFC Films Was there no one to suggest that the script by Joseph Muszynski and Christina Mengert had certain deficits? All the same the spectacle of first-rate actors attacking third-rate material is guilty fun. And even though Dianes young son makes a nuisance of himself as a compulsive videographer the little film he finally puts together is unexpectedly touching for what it says of how the familys trip to Woodstock changed everyones lives. Unlike the surrounding movie its supposed to be amateurish. ENLARGE DVD Focus Jane Eyre (2011) Michael Fassbender is Rochester in Cary Fukunagas transfixing version of the Charlotte Bronte romance which stars Mia Wasikowska as Jane. Mr. Fassbenders lord of the cursed manor is worthy of his governesss love even though hes no match for the one played by Timothy Dalton when it comes to despair or towering rage and though he wisely doesnt imitate Orson Welless doomy self-regard in the role. Instead of a black hole taking energy in hes a pulsar pumping it out in the form of pain relieved at least for a while by wry humor and an openness to Janes beauty. Dumbo (1941) It doesnt have the historical significance of ""Snow White"" but seven decades havent diluted its appeal and the digital medium makes it almost a sure thing that those pink elephants are still parading in accurate colors. The film comes and goes in a mere 64 minutes but its filled with visual delights and unforgettably deep feelings. Todays moviegoers who often choose to see an animated feature on the strength of which famous actors have done the voices may find it surprising that neither Dumbo nor his mother ever say a word. Woodstock (1970) No concert film before or since has combined as many memorable performances with as much local color--cops looking the other way cameras looking every which way. But no other concert film has had such a vast and colorful canvas to feast its lenses on. Whether ""Woodstock"" does or doesnt stand at the top of its genre its a singular piece of reportage even anthropology (or archaeology) just as the Woodstock festival remains a singular event in the cultural life of the nation. The first-time director a cinematographer with the instincts of a documentarian was Michael Wadleigh.

Its running low on new ideas though some of the conclusions these critters -- lion zebra hippo and giraffe -- reach about their fates may surprise you.But its also funny a farce closer to Shrek the Third than say Toy Story 3.We pick up the story of the zoo escapees Marty the zebra (Chris Rock) Alex the lion (Ben Stiller) Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer) in Africa. The penguins sent to find help landed in Monte Carlo.Every penguin scene is hilarious -- they were the only characters to get their own spinoff TV series.

Thats where King Julien of the lemurs meets his true love -- a tutu-wearing tricycle-riding bear.The other new characters here are the circus animals who add little to the merriment save for Martin Short who voices Stefano the Italian-accented sea lion.Madagascar has always had the subtext of which is better -- a life in captivity where theyre coddled and adored or something more challenging -- but its been less about message and more about laughs. Europes Most Wanted despite its shrinking ambitions and slow spots still delivers those -- usually in a South Pole tuxedo.MADAGASCAR 3 EUROPES MOST WANTED (B-)Directed by Eric Darnell Tom McGrath and Conrad Vernon.

Is it safe to say that a studio has officially obnoxiously overdone a movies marketing when a review cannot help but discuss the commercials first? Yes the kids and I laughed (not inappropriately hopefully) the first couple of times we saw Chris Rocks ""Madagascar 3"" ad spot with Marty the zebra doing his circus-afro shtick. For all his sociopolitical savvy Rock also knows silly and he made it work. But I wish we had kept count of how many times per day we would end up seeing the thing over the next several weeks. Six? Ten? Way too many certainly for a gag so fragilely dependent on the Gilbert Gottfried Schools loud-is-funny paradigm. You can picture the DreamWorks corporate confab ""OK the kids respond to move-it move-it repetition -- give us something else repetitive and lets get herding."" It wasnt just desperate it was insulting.It also was not entirely necessary. Theres some bona fide big-top wonder in this team-up between ragtag European circus critters (notably Bryan Cranstons ""Breaking Bad""-broody Russian tiger) and Central Park Zoo expats Marty Alex the lion (Ben Stiller) Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer) and Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith). Cascading colorful 3-D performance sequences are sufficiently dazzling that youll forgive the bajillionth soundtrack sampling of ""Firework."" Theres also script material co-written by Noah Baumbach (Stillers ""Greenberg"") seemingly a fresh choice. (Grown-ups can entertain themselves guessing what Baumbach might have contributed the risque stuff between Sacha Baron Cohens King Julien and a feral she-bear? The Cirque du Soleil riffs?) And theres some fun patter from Martin Short surprisingly avoiding staleness himself as a Roberto Benigni-broad Italiano seal.There might be even more to offset the movies beaten-to-death signature bit if an act wasnt wasted on geographic housekeeping -- something about those rascally penguins and chimps being in Monte Carlo hedonistically squandering the ingenuity that could get the gang home. Its the same lesson that the ""Beverly Hills Cop"" crew never learned Why not just lose the setting from your title and free up your sequel plotting completely? Still this convoluted stretch does introduce Frances McDormands amusing Capitaine DuBois an animal-control gendarme with an anti-PETA streak worthy of Cruella De Vil and whose dogged pursuit chases our heroes to the circus. Shes as ridiculously relentless as those ads. Almost anyway.Tom Russo can be reached at trusso2222gmail.com. (c) Copyright 2012 Globe Newspaper Company.

The jokes come so fast theyre nearly subliminal. Plot points whiz by and when things threaten to blur theres a crazy musical number or a tightly worked out physical comedy routine involving a hippo or a penguin. Then its back on the bullet train. Your brain goes breathless and giddy struggling to keep up. Like ""Madagascar 2"" this one begins right where the previous story left off. Alex the lion (voiced by Ben Stiller) Marty the zebra (Chris Rock) Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) and the rest of the refugees from the Central Park Zoo are still stranded in Africa and yearning to get back where they belong. The rickety monkey-built plane from the last installment achieves liftoff but the avaricious penguins and vainglorious King Julien the lemur (Sacha Baron Cohen) are as usual infuriating double-crossers and our heroes are left to their own devices. With faultless cartoon logic the menagerie scuba-dives to Monaco where they make a shambles of the famed casino. With animal control officer Capt. Chantel DuBois (Frances McDormand) in hot pursuit they hide in a traveling circus meeting new characters including Vitaly (Bryan Cranston) a growling heavy-souled Siberian tiger. As the circus tours Rome and London the film has plenty of broad fun with European stereotypes. Capt. DuBois is the mirror image of the ineffectual gendarme pursuing the runaway animals with ninja-like agility and tenacity a Terminator would admire. Shes still French to the core though breaking into an extended Edith Piaf routine that will tickle kids even if they dont get the context. There are a couple of funny cross-species love affairs. Baron Cohens lemur flips for the circuss unicycle star a plump tutu-clad grizzly bear. The script by indie filmmaker Noah Baumbach (""The Squid and the Whale"" ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"") adds a creative off-kilter vibe that sets the cartoon apart from ""Madagascars"" animated peers. Its not every writer who would see the comic potential of putting those mismatched lovers in ravishingly romantic Roman vistas with Andrea Bocelli warbling love songs. It kills. Gia (Jessica Chastain) a flirtatious leopard with eyes for Alex is a wonderful new addition. Shes a very sensuous nubile feline. After some kittenish shenanigans he impatiently asks her ""Are you five?"" She replies ""Yes"" leaving us in the audience to do swift mental calculations from cat years to human to assure ourselves shes not underage. Then you realize youre fretting over moral peril to a cat. A cartoon cat. MADAGASCAR 3 EUROPES MOST WANTED  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG for mild action and rude humor. RottenTomatoes.com read reviews Showtimes view listings | 3D A circus contract that could bring the animals back to America sets up the finale a whirligig spectacle of acrobatic teamwork to the tune of Katy Perrys ""Firework"" that ends the movie on a delirious high note.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The former Central Park Zoo animals join a traveling circus in the hopes of going home. BOTTOM LINE Another harmless but heartless addition to this franchise long on jokes and short on warmth. CAST Voices of Ben Stiller Chris Rock David Schwimmer Jada Pinkett Smith LENGTH 122 If you typically check the ingredients on the stuff you feed your kids here is what youll find in ""Madagascar 3"" jokes Katy Perry music and less than 2 percent of character development and emotional warmth. Thats a typical formula for this animated franchise in which four Central Park Zoo refugees keep trying to make it back home but this chapter is an even more aggressive barrage of one-liners pop tunes and random references to everything from Edith Piaf to the Vatican. Not every kids movie needs to be as profound as ""Old Yeller"" but ""Madagascar 3"" is the exact opposite as frenetic and incoherent as Robin Williams on a bender. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Subtitled ""Europes Most Wanted"" the film begins as a spy spoof with Alex the lion (Ben Stiller) Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer) Marty the zebra (Chris Rock) and Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) infiltrating a Monte Carlo casino. That story however is jettisoned faster than you can say ""Cars 2"" Pixars spy-themed dud from last year. Our heroes fib their way into a shabby traveling circus instead. Suddenly ""Madagascar 3"" becomes an animal version of ""The Music Man"" as Alex presenting himself as an American megastar tries to inspire the once-fearless tiger Vitaly (Bryan Cranston) the acrobatic jaguar Gia (Jessica Chastain) and the weepy sea lion Stefano (Martin Short). That has its charms but an unshakable Monte Carlo cop named DuBois (Frances McDormand) keeps reminding us of the previous plotline. With her weirdly caricatured femininity -- a Marlene Dietrich face atop dumpy hips -- shes a particularly unwelcome villain. Desperately directed by Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath and co-written by the unlikely Noah Baumbach (the indie drama ""The Squid and the Whale"") ""Madagascar 3"" is mostly harmless junk food. If anything it could use a little sweetening. 231 VideoTrailer Madagascar 3 PLOT The former Central Park Zoo animals join a traveling circus in the hopes of going home.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Movies Madagascar 3 Europes Most Wanted Cirque de Berserk This DreamWorks animated sequel pushes cartoon mayhem to its insane apogee By Richard Corliss June 06 2012 Share Read Later Paramount Pictures / DreamWorks Madagascar 3 Europes Most Wanted Year 2012 Director Eric Darnell Tom McGrath Conrad Vernon Network Paramount Pictures Cast Ben Stiller Jada Pinkett Smith Chris Rock David Schwimmer Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Why did the Disney animated classics unspool at feature-length while the great Warner Bros. cartoons clocked in at just seven minutes? Because films like Pinocchio told dramatic stories through pictures and the exploits of Bugs Daffy and Sylvester were vignettes of comic catastrophe. To sustain that pace for an hour and a half would be exhausting both for the Warners directors and their fans. Chuck Jones Road Runner cartoons like Fast and Furry-ous and Zoom and Bored are masterpieces of minimalist humor. Stretch them to 80 or 90 minutes and you get 80 or 90 variations on the same theme Coyote hatches a plan executes it and goes BOOOOM in a Groundhog Day loop of humiliating failures. Some great treats are designed to come in small packages. Jones acknowledged this and found fault with the 1988 Who Framed Roger Rabbit because it applied the rigorously violent rules of cartoon shorts to a mostly animated film that ran or galloped for 104 minutes. I too was wearied by director Robert Zemeckis nonstop exertions; what began as lunatic inspiration eventually devolved into water torture. Yet there I was a few weeks ago at the Cannes Film Festival braving the even more remorseless comic assault of Madagascar 3 Europes Most Wanted and somehow enjoying it. (READ Corliss tribute to Chuck Jones) O.K. part of my response may have been the DreamWorks movies polar distance from the typical Cannes selection where every character is miserable in slow motion -- the kind of film experience that as somebody once said is like watching pain dry. But I also thought that Madagascar 3 directed by Eric Darnell Tom McGrath and Conrad Vernon boldly and gaily sustained the madcap momentum for the whole of its eighty-few minutes. Again we have the four domesticated beasts from Manhattans Central Park Zoo -- Alex the lion (Ben Stiller) Marty the zebra (Chris Rock) Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer) -- who go on odd adventures. Last time they found a happy abode and some new friends in Africa. But the homesick Alex hears ""New York New York"" calling him and lands in Europe with his three old pals plus King Julien the lemur (Sacha Baron Cohen) and hordes of mischievous monkeys and penguins. (READ Corlisss review of Madagascar Escape 2 Africa) Why Europe? Because each Madagascar movie needs a different setting; and because the continent with folks of many nationalities to make gentle mock of has already served as the excuse for such earlier sequels as National Lampoons European Vacation and Pixars Cars 2. And why may the Mad menagerie never go home for good? Because home is boring and domestic contentment a snooze. Thats why there was never a Wizard of Oz sequel called Dorothy Stays in Kansas. In Monte Carlo the gang is corralled into an Oceans Eleven-style heist gone horribly wrong. On the run from the vindictive animal-wrangler Chantel duBois (Frances McDormand) they hide out with a traveling circus modeled on Cirque du Soleil -- except that Cirque has no animals and this one is only animals the sexy jaguar Gia (Jessica Chastain) and the cowardly sea lion Stefano (Martin Short) and the Siberian tiger Vitaly (Bryan Cranston) whos as proud as Ivan the Terrible and as truculent as Putin the Terribler. (LIST Find a DreamWorks cartoon on the 25 all-TIME Best Animated Features) Darnell and McGrath who also directed the first two Madagascar movies have learned that nothing succeeds like excess so they dont bother with down-time scenes that would let the audience catch its collective breath. Nor do they worry that the typhoon of pop-culture references may elude some viewers. At first the comic tone is archer than the McDonalds logo; parts of Mad 3 are reminiscent of such strenuously zany mid-60s farces as Whats New Pussycat Help and the Casino Royale parody. Then the picture goes truly nuts and approaches the comic surrealism of a very early Warners cartoon gem Bob Clampetts 1938  Porky in Wackyland. Only in 3-D with fireworks and magical flying circuses. Its a true Cirque de Berserk. For those who suspect that Mad 3 would be similar in ambition to Cars 2 -- a transparent play for the European movie market and a feature-length product placement for toys that continental parents are expected to buy for their kids -- surprise The script by Darnell and indie-acerbic auteur Noah Baumbach (The Squid and the Whale) takes pleasure in mocking the very moviegoers its ostensibly courting as when someone says of Europeans ""They only have to work two weeks a year"" (and another replies just to annoy our North American neighbors ""So they have the Canadian work ethic""). (LIST Which animated film is No. 1 on Corlisss 10 Greatest Movies of the Millennium?) Mad 3 doesnt exactly belong in the animation Hall of Fame. What King Julien says of himself -- ""Im just an emotional whoopee cushion for you to sit on"" -- is equally true of this psy-comic sequel. I dont know what Chuck Jones would think of this since the great man died in 2002. But I have to give props to a movie that ascends from eccentricity to insanity without losing its footing In circus terms its like a guy whos shot out of a cannon and lands on a high wire in a perfect pirouette.

(DreamWorks Animation) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday June 7 2012 158 PM Title Madagascar 3 Film Info PG. Area theaters. Early in ""Madagascar 3 Europes Most Wanted"" Alex the lion again voiced by Ben Stiller appreciates a mini-Times Square made for him by his pals Marty the zebra (Chris Rock) Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer) and Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith). Smiling wistfully at the town his friends have re-created out of sand Alex grins at the thought of ""Times Square with its modern corporate lack of character"" Um Alex? That pretty much describes the movie youre in. Seven years after this foursome escaped from the Central Park zoo and landed off the coast of Africa ingeniousness in this third ""Madagascar"" is even harder to find than old 42nd St. Worried he and his friends will turn old without ever seeing their beloved zoo again Alex decides they should follow the tough-guy penguins whove hot-wired a plane and headed to Monte Carlo. Easy-peasy. A few minutes later the action moves to a casino where the erudite monkey Mason and King Julian the lemur (Sasha Baron Cohen) cause mischief. After a ruckus the animals attract the attention of an animal control officer named Dubois (Frances McDormand). She collects animal heads and now wants Alexs. Alexs head however is busy hatching schemes. Finding a shabby traveling circus Alex Melman Marty and Gloria pose as performers to hitch a ride on the carnival train. There they meet the surly Russian tiger Vitaly (Bryan Cranston) the ooh-la feline Gia (Jessica Chastain) and the blubbery Italian sea lion Stefano (Martin Short) who hopes Alexs ideas can update their shtick. King Julian romances a bear. Despite a script co-written by Noah Baumbach ""Madagascar 3"" cant upgrade its own shtick becoming a craven example of a fast-buck no-fun family film. Emotionally the characters are stuck where they were in the first film and its 2008 sequel. Marty plays up his stripes by wearing a rainbow afro wig. Alex helps put on a good show. The sniveling Melman walks a tightrope. Meanwhile Stefano -- one of the more annoying creations in recent animation despite Shorts vocal gymnastics -- is shot out of a cannon. Actually all the new additions are sideshow freaks. The weirdly curvy girl-faced Gia is like a Humanimal from ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" and Vitaly is a knife-throwing Russian heavy. Baumbachs big idea -- to make Dubois an Edith Piaf-singing grotesquerie whose angular cheekbones and nasty mien honor the edgier animation made overseas -- could scare young audiences who may be unsure if Alex being chased by a knife-wielding Frenchwoman is cute. Even the penguins sound bored in ""Madagascar 3"" and thats saying something. Or to quote a penguin line from the first film ""Well this sucks.""

Madagascar 3 Europes Most Wanted Fair Directors Eric Darnell Tom McGrath Conrad Vernon. Cast Ben Stiller Chris Rock Jada Pinkett Smith. Rating PG for some mild action and rude humor. >> Cedric the Entertainer talks joy frustrations of Madagascar | 10 best animated animal movies The film directed by the trio of Eric Darnell Tom McGrath and Conrad Vernon has quite a few laughs for adults and kids like its predecessors. And the core cast of Ben Stiller Chris Rock David Schwimmer and Jada Pinkett Smith returns joined this time around by Jessica Chastain Bryan Cranston and Frances McDormand. But the story by Darnell and Noah Baumbach defies the conventions of its own universe -- which granted is pretty liberal when it comes to realism. But plot devices and developments appear out of nowhere in a throw-it-at-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks approach. Its silly and its lazy. And yet again its pretty funny. Alex the lion (Stiller) Marty the zebra (Rock) Melman the giraffe (Schwimmer) and his girlfriend Gloria the hippo (Smith) still stranded in Africa have had enough. Theyre desperate to get back to the zoo in New York where their adventures began two movies ago. So -- and here you might see a little of the manic plotting creeping in -- they swim from Africa to Monte Carlo where the penguins are making a fortune gambling in the casinos. Um OK. A plan to fly back to the U.S. on a plane falls through foiled by general ineptitude on the part of the animals and manic zeal on the part of Capt. Chantel DuBois (McDormand) an obsessive animal-control officer whose office wall sports an array of heads of animals shes ... caught. Alex moves to No. 1 on her list of most-wanted. Fleeing they wind up on a circus train trying to convince the animals on board that they too are circus folk as they hide from DuBois. Gia (Chastain) a jaguar wants to take them in but surly Russian tiger Vitaly (Cranston) doesnt trust them. Then again hes got issues which will be explained eventually. In another instance of the filmmakers just throwing something out there and seeing if anyone notices the stowaway animals buy the circus which turns out to be dreadful in performance in Rome. Cue the inspirational Alex speech. If they can convince a rich American investor during a London show how good they are they can make the trip to the U.S. And suddenly after a little practice the circus equipment is first-rate the skills unparalleled. Its a 3-D neon-colored explosion. Which is kind of fun to watch but where did all this come from? Maybe Im being too picky but it was just too much. Lets put on a show sure but the upgrade is so great as to be ridiculous; this is like Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney using CGI and green screens. OK enough complaining. The gang still has Capt. DuBois to deal with and she will not quit without a fight. Several in fact. More challenging still is the decision Alex and friends have to make. Given the chance to return to living at the zoo would they take it? (""I dont remember that wall between us"" Gloria asks Melman in one of the sweeter moments in the movie. ""Was it always there?"") The decision is interrupted by more wham-bang action; the film never lets up. We have gotten to know and like these characters over three movies and most of what made us feel that way about them is still on display.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Aside from Pixar (and even that studio isnt always safe territory) computer-animated kiddie flicks like Madagascar 3 Europes Most Wanted usually arent movies so much as collections of brightly colored shapes past-their-sell-date pop songs (Reel 2 Reals ""I Like To Move It"" a franchise favorite gets another airing in the latest installment) wacky celebrity voices and merchandising opportunities. So the threequel--which has a trio of directors (Eric Darnell Tom McGrath and Conrad Vernon) and was co-written by of all people The Squid And The Whale writer-director Noah Baumbach--deserves a moment of applause for being so deeply engagingly weird. The basic idea of the series that a foursome of pampered New York zoo creatures (voiced by Ben Stiller Chris Rock David Schwimmer and Jada Pinkett Smith) have ended up in the wild still informs the setup though the film essentially throws it out the window after a few minutes. The animals begin in Africa where theyre waiting for their super-competent penguin buddies to return from Monaco in their chimp-powered plane. Getting antsy the four decide to go meet the birds and break into the casino where theyve been staying attracting the attention of animal-control officer Chantel DuBois (Frances McDormand). Impassive seemingly indestructible and so French shes able to revive her comrades by singing ""Non Je Ne Regrette Rien"" DuBois is an entertainingly proficient villain who tracks the animals via a stunning physics-defying chase through Monte Carlo involving banana guns and skating through puddles of fish while holding a Vespa aloft. And this is all before a storyline in which the fugitives join a Euro circus. Madagascar 3 tramples all logic with disarming exuberance--an unlikely romance that develops between Sacha Baron Cohens flamboyant lemur and a tricycle-riding bear is indulged to the point where the two take a trip to the Vatican to meet the pope while ""Con Te Partiro"" plays in the background. Scenes like the pursuit through the streets of Monaco a climactic circus performance a signature hoop-jumping trick by a tiger voiced by Bryan Cranston and a rescue via air balloon and trapeze actually merit 3-D and delve into the surreal. Credit Baumbach credit the filmmakers credit no one giving a damn anymore--for whats yet another hyperactive talking-animal childrens movie Madagascar 3 Europes Most Wanted is uncommonly rewarding and a potential future stoners delight.

The third chapter in the saga of Alex the lion (Ben Stiller) and his Central Park Zoo pals -- now nostalgic for New York after their foray into Africa -- has timing up the wazoo. Its there in a (literally) over-the-top chase through the skies of Monte Carlo in the grouchy fun of a troupe of Euro circus animals our heroes hook up with and in bits like Marty the zebra (Chris Rock) singing a circus jingle inspired by his psychedelic Afro wig. The story in Madagascar 3 is functional but the antically civilized spirit is infectious.

"Madagascar 3 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; madagascar-3 ) Madagascar 3 (United States 2012) June 06 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Madagascar 3 raises an interesting question about what movie-goers want from animated films intelligent thoughtful productions that use artwork rather than live-action to tell a story or colorful crap that can be used to distract children for about 90 minutes. Madagascar 3 much like its predecessors is a perfect example of the latter. It has value only as a way to engage a very young viewer until his or her attention span expires. For many adults sitting through this will be an exercise in tedium. It offers about as much as an oversized overlong Saturday morning cartoon and if thats where expectations are set it probably wont disappoint. Talk about setting the bar low though. The animal characters in the Madagascar series - Alex the Lion (voice of Ben Stiller) Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock) Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) and Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) - are classic examples of ""grass is always greener"" types. Theyre never satisfied with where they are. In this case they have decided theyre bored with Africa and want to return to the Central Park Zoo in New York which they affectionately call ""home."" Getting there proves to be a bit of a challenge however requring stop-overs in Monte Carlo Rome and London. Along the way they make an enemy of French Animal Control officer Captain DuBois (Frances McDormand) who wants nothing more than to mount a lions head on her wall. They join the circus where they are welcomed with warmth by Stefano the Seal (Martin Short) wariness by Gia the Jaguar (Jessica Chastain) and hostility by Vitaly the Tiger (Bryan Cranston). Eventually they all learn to work together to catch the attention of a U.S. promoter who will fund their trip across the Atlantic. The movie looks nice but so what? Crisp detailed well-rendered images are used in service of a plot that could have been scribbled on a few sheets of toilet paper by a ten-year old. We get the usual lessons about friendship and tolerance that animated movies love to serve up. Theres plenty of hum-drum action and a flashy acrobatic sequence done to the tune of Katy Perrys ""Firework."" That segment makes no sense whatsoever but its got a lot of pretty colors choreographed action and a familiar song. Kids will eat it up and when it shows up on You Tube it will get 100000000 views. The Madagascar series has never been one of my favorites. In the first film the premise was thin and the charm of the characters dubious. The sequel convinced me that the filmmakers should have stopped after installment 1 but like Shrek Dreamworks will run this one into the ground until theres no more money to be made. Are we supposed to like these characters and enjoy their dubious antics? The Pink Panther TV cartoons have better realized anthropomorphized animals and more clever storylines and theyre about six minutes long. Theres nothing to add to what I have previously written about the voice work. Ben Stiller and David Schwimmer sound effectively anonymous. Chris Rock has the most energy. Jada Pinkett Smith isnt given much to do. Without checking a cast list I wouldnt have recognized any of the newcomers - Frances McDormand Jessica Chastain Martin Short and Bryan Cranston - but thats a good thing. In an animated setting when you dont recognize a voice youre more open to the character and your immersion isnt impeded by other associations. This includes the most obviously gimmicky use of 3-D to have come along recently. The 3-D isnt ""bad"" in the sense that its blurry or dim or cheap looking. In fact it appears to have been rendered with some degree of care. However its pointless. It exists primarily so kids can squeal with excitement as things fly at them from the screen. There is no legitimate reason why anyone should pay anything extra for the benefit of watching Madagascar 3 in 3-D. Its sad to see all the technical expertise evident in the visual aspects of this movie wasted in service of such a derivative and fundamentally unsatisfying experience. Madagascar 3 will probably do well at the box office because its release date has been beautifully timed. Its the first legitimate ""family film"" since Pirates Band of Misfits and it opens around the time when the school year is winding down. Added to that its only direct competition Disney/Pixars Brave is still a couple of weeks away. When it comes to kids dont underestimate the appeal of a familiar label and cute animals. Despite the occasional half-hearted innuendo Madagascar 3 is not intended for adults.

The third time despite what youve heard is rarely the charm but ""Madagascar 3 Europes Most Wanted"" marks the spot where a shrill and unfunny kid franchise made the leap into hilarious and engaging family entertainment. Part of that transition may have to do with the addition of co-writer Noah Baumbach best known for indies like ""Greenberg"" (starring Ben Stiller who voices lion Alex here) and ""Margot at the Wedding"" but who made his bones in the animation world by collaborating with Wes Anderson on their charming adaptation of ""Fantastic Mr. Fox."" Whatever the reason ""Madagascar 3"" finds the franchise finally finding its comedic groove mixing character-based comedy outrageous adventures and the occasional bit of parent-friendly wordplay. We last left our heroes -- Alex zebra Marty (Chris Rock) hippo Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith) and giraffe Melman (David Schwimmer) -- living the high life on the African veldt. Like all transplanted New Yorkers however they all kvetch about missing the Big Apple and decide to make their way back to the Central Park Zoo they successfully escaped two movies ago. This involves snorkeling to Monaco (dont ask) to reunite with the penguins and chimps who can fly an airplane (no really dont ask). Their stint in Monte Carlo draws the attention of ruthless animal control cop Captain Chantel DuBois (Frances McDormand summoning all the Gallic hauteur she can muster) who would like nothing more than to add Alexs head to the menagerie of stuffed trophies on her wall. Pursued by DuBois the animals join up with a down-on-its-luck circus pretending to be performers themselves so that they can hop the train and get out of the country. The circus fortunes declined when knife-throwing tiger Vitaly (Bryan Cranston) lost his mojo but leopard Gia (Jessica Chastain) thinks these Americans can put their three-ring show back on top. Not that the plot -- how will the circus animals react when they find out their new compadres are mere zoo attractions? -- matters much; directors Eric Darnell (who co-wrote) and Tom McGrath use the circus setting as a springboard for eye-popping 3D visuals (theres a trapeze sequence thats as trippy as anything since the ""Pink Elephants on Parade"" number in ""Dumbo"") and some genuinely funny character interactions. The returning players all seem to be more on their game Stillers less of a whiner Rock tones it down a notch or two (but still rattles off a circus theme song thats still stuck in my head) and it turns out that Schwimmers voice sounds more natural coming out of the mouth of a neurotic giraffe than it does coming out of Schwimmer himself. Of the new additions Cranston Chastain and Martin Short (as a dopey but friendly performing seal) all score but McDormand steals her every scene. It helps that the hyper-capable DuBois nonetheless becomes the object of lots of wonderfully slapstick Inspector Clouseau-esque abuse. If the previous ""Madagascar"" entries left you cold take the plunge with this threequel. You will believe a hippopotamus can tight-rope dance. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

But after the cargo plane that the wayward Central Park animals planned to fly back to Manhattan crashes and burns our wild-kingdom heroes plot an alternate route home that involves joining up with a demoralized circus troupe. This three-ring marriage of convenience adds a knife-throwing Russian tiger (voiced by Bryan Cranston) a jaguar trapezist (Jessica Chastain) and a buffoonish Italian sea lion (Martin Short)--along with their retinue of dodgy accents--to Ben Stillers cowardly lion Chris Rocks chatty-Cathy zebra etc. The unwieldy conglomeration of old and new characters teeters like a pyramid of acrobats atop a miniature tricycle but Europes Most Wanted moves with enough speed to keep from collapsing in a heap of blood and greasepaint. The faster the better in fact since despite Noah Baumbachs cowriting credit there are few lines worth lingering on. (A homesick New Yorkers longing for ""nine Duane Reades on every street"" is a noteworthy exception.) Frances McDormand brings the jambon as an animal-control expert who tracks down the menagerie with Javert-like zeal rousing her troops with some off-key Edith Piaf. For the most part however Madagscar 3 is less interested in plucking the last bit of meat off the seriess bones than with simply picking the lowest-hanging fruit.

Like a big-screen Big Gulp this third installment of the billion-dollar animated franchise contains as much cinematic confection as an 85-minute movie can bear. It incorporates even more riotous movement and cacophonous sound than its predecessors more characters than you can reasonably track more locations than a Bourne film (Africa to Monte Carlo to Rome to London to New York) and an extra dimension (3-D natch). The series third director (Shrek 2s Conrad Vernon joins original tandem Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath) gives us the same core four animals--lion Alex (Ben Stiller) zebra Marty (Chris Rock) hippo Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith) and giraffe Melman (David Schwimmer)--still looking for a way back home to the Central Park Zoo. They rejoin an anarchic tribe of penguins and monkeys for an extended detour through Europe where they run afoul of Gallic animal-huntress Capitaine Chantel DuBois (a full-throttled Frances McDormand) and join a disheveled circus. Despite a steady barrage of sight gags and pop-culture references the film works best when downshifted to good old-fashioned character development particularly when establishing newcomers like Vitaly (Bryan Cranston) an embittered Siberian tiger and Stefano (Martin Short) a dim-witted eager-to-please sea lion. But when everyone teams up to give the circus an American-style upgrade the results are Madagascar 3 in miniature In lieu of finesse and high-wire elegance theres a torrent of jet packs screaming lights infinitely elasticized creatures pyrotechnical bombast and Katy Perrys ""Firework.""

Powered by a dazzling circus act a gaggle of goofy accents and a fresh dose of action-adventure silliness ""Madagascar 3 Europes Most Wanted"" severs the DreamWorks toon franchises ties to reality entirely and emerges none the worse for it. Good-humored and endearing full of energy and color (sometimes neon) if not quite Pixar-level invention the series shortest and most ambitious entry sends its homesick menagerie in the direction of New York with scenic and amusing stops in Monte Carlo London and Rome along the way. Vigorous execution plus 3D premiums should spell beaucoup biz for the June 8 release. This is the rare animated property that has consistently improved on its ho-hum origins as 2008s ""Madagascar Escape 2 Africa"" delivered unexpectedly fine character shadings and a less grating sense of humor than the 2005 franchise-starter. Given an extra-loopy comic spin by scribes Noah Baumbach (who previously ventured into animation writing with ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"") and Eric Darnell ""Madagascar 3"" places a higher value on speed and spectacle than either of its predecessors piling on the narrative lunacy to outlandish even surreal ends. Even though life is good in the African savannah the series mane attraction Alex (voiced by Ben Stiller) decides its high time he and his comrades -- raucous zebra Marty (Chris Rock) nervous giraffe Melman (David Schwimmer) and spirited hippo Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith) -- return home to the Central Park Zoo. Story continuity not being a huge priority here the other lions zebras giraffes and hippos the characters befriended in ""Escape 2 Africa"" are nowhere to be seen making their decision to go all ""Homeward Bound"" an easy one. Their plane used to great effect in the first and second film however is on the French Riviera where their wily penguin pals have gone clean out the casino. After a quick snorkeling trip across the Mediterranean Alex and crew end up in a high-flying action sequence through the streets of Monte Carlo with the pics formidable new villain a psychotic animal-control chief (Frances McDormand) who can rightly be called PETAs worst nightmare in hot pursuit. To evade capture Alex and his four-legged friends do the obvious thing and join the circus -- specifically a train full of down-on-their-luck animal performers who could wind up with a U.S. tour if they play their cards right. The proceedings are thus elevated by a conventional if sturdy lets-put-on-a-show dynamic courtesy of a slew of engaging new characters including sassy jaguar Gia (Jessica Chastain) and eager-to-please sea lion Stefano (Martin Short). Easily the most compelling addition to the furry ensemble is Vitaly (Bryan Cranston) a growling foul-tempered Siberian tiger who always looks ready to offer you a bowl of poisoned Frosted Flakes. The ethnic and cultural stereotyping is as broad as the spirited across-the-board voicework; Italy in particular takes the brunt of the cliches not only from Shorts over-the-top accent but also from a brief montage of the Forum and the Vatican scored to Andrea Boccelli. Its typical of the generally winning sensibility at work however that this sequence serves as the backdrop for a ridiculous interspecies romance between nutty lemur king Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen) and an enormous bear on a bicycle making it not just bearable but borderline lovely. A bit crammed but not too crowded zipping along at a well-modulated rarely frenetic pace ""Madagascar 3"" generates considerable excitement with a pair of circus-act climaxes that even the excessive use of Katy Perrys ubiquitous pop single ""Firework"" cannot entirely extinguish. The acrobatic mayhem is well-served by the consistently bright eye-popping visuals employing a much richer and more complex color palette than the series has yet attempted. The 3D application is far from subtle shoving everything from animal snouts to flaming pieces of rubble into the viewers personal space but goes for more nuanced layering effects in background shots. Having pulled out all the stops franchise helmers Darnell and Tom McGrath (joined here at the helm by Conrad Vernon) may well be hard pressed to scope out new frontiers for their animal creations after this. Should a rumored but still-unconfirmed fourth picture materialize it would have to ship the characters to Asia or back in time -- or both.

TWITTER The Paramount release from DreamWorks Animation had its world premiere with a special screening at the film festival. After the American vehicles went somewhat off-track overseas in Cars 2 the New York zoo animals go a bit bonkers on a trek through the Continent in Madagascar 3 Europes Most Wanted. Not only extra-dimensional but extra-loud extra-antic and extra-frenetic this latest addition to what is already a billion-dollar franchise wont see its diminished charm and humor too drastically impact its built-in money-making capabilities. The Paramount release from DreamWorks Animation received a Friday noontime world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival. PHOTOS 10 Inappropriately Sexy Cartoon Characters Dubiously desiring to return to their New York City zoo origins after their escapades in the wild in Madagascar and Africa lion Alex (Ben Stiller) zebra Marty (Chris Rock) giraffe Melman (David Schwimmer) and hippo Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith) pick up where they left off at the end of the second installment in 2008 by pursuing the fleeing monkeys and penguins to Monte Carlo where the havoc the animal interlopers wreak on the principality provokes the ire of a relentless animal control cop Captain Chantel DuBois. Pointy-nosed cannon-breasted broad-butted capable of following a scent like a bloodhound and moving like a spider DuBois is one of two captivating new creations in this chapter a deliciously demented adversary whos been lip-smackingly voiced with a French accent by Frances McDormand. The other fresh character with an entirely different sort of appeal is Gia a slinky Italian jaguar who enters the picture as part of a traveling circus the American gang joins as a cover for their journey through Europe. Gia purringly voiced by Jessica Chastain is a natural and inherently provocative romantic foil for the bashful Alex and is rendered very appealingly in the gentle coloration of her coat and her physical manner. PHOTOS Cannes 2012 Day 2 in Pictures Although the Russian tiger boss (Bryan Cranston) of the circus remains dubious about the Yankee interlopers the train proceeds to Rome the Alps and London where the troupe puts on a spectacular laser-dominated show backed by Katy Perrys ""Fireworks"" involving a lot of vertiginous high-diving and trapeze stunts that put the 3D to full use. The cavernous space criss-crossed by shafts of multi-colored light reminds of nothing so much as the futuristic motor speedway in Tron with a bit of Speed Racer thrown in. Once back at the Central Park Zoo the returning Americans begin to question their decision to return wondering if the adventures theyve had havent given them full lives they wouldnt have experienced otherwise. But then who should reappear but DuBois entirely out of her jurisdiction but determined to eradicate once and for all the pesky varmints that have given her so much trouble. PHOTOS Cannes 2012 Opening Night Gala Madagascar 3 is colorful moves like the TGV rather than the slow zoo train on view and is over in a flash. But its dominated by the characters shouting over one another repetitively reacting with alarm to anything that happens and overcompensating for largely unfunny material by overacting by about 300 percent. Yes its a cartoon but its conspicuously unmodulated with the volume set on high and the pacing all but pushed to fast-forward. Few traces of the wit and sophistication co-screenwriter Noah Baumbach helped bring to Fantastic Mr. Fox can be detected here. The other writer Eric Darnell was again joined as director by Tom McGrath as well for the first time by Conrad Vernon who worked on the first two installments as a creative consultant and voice actor and also directed Shrek 2 and Monsters vs. Aliens.
