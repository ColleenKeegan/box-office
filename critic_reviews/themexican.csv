More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

(DreamWorks) So Brad and Julia finally coordinated their schedules so they could be in the same movie As mere mortals we can only humbly imagine the awesome alignment of personal managers agents casting directors and studio executives (and lets not forget their message-taking coffee-getting underlings) it must have taken to make this event take place. I mean people should win Oscars for that stuff right? But for now let me take the time to analyze the movie in which these legends have agreed to appear as characters. This terrible movie in which they have agreed to appear I should add. Its called ""The Mexican"" and features Pitt and Roberts (oh dear am I listing them in the right order?) as two misfit offbeat lovers. Hes Jerry Welbach a bagman for a crime syndicate who is trying to get out of the business. Shes his girlfriend Samantha whos dying to be a Vegas croupier and wants Jerry to quit his dirty work. Unfortunately Jerry runs a red light causing an accident which indirectly sets into motion a whole series of connected events. His boss is sent to jail leaving the second-in-command Bernie (Bob Balaban) to give Jerry an ultimatum complete one more assignment or get killed. Jerry goes with the life plan. He agrees to go to Mexico and retrieve a priceless collectors item an antique pistol known as ""the Mexican."" This gun has a heartbreaking story behind it which we learn about over the course of the movie. Samantha is not happy about this extra mission and she breaks up with Jerry whom she considers selfish and incompetent at running his life. She splits for Vegas to realize her gaming dream. Both run into complications. In Mexico a freak accident leaves Jerry bearing the blame for a dead man. This makes his bosses even angrier. En route to Vegas Samantha runs afoul of two hit men (James Gandolfini and Sherman Augustus) who are battling each other to hold her hostage. The one who calls himself Leroy (Gandolfini) wins the bloody contest and keeps Samantha prisoner until Jerry brings back that gun. Samantha whos big on the science of romantic relationships becomes friendly with her captor. And they bond despite the situation. Theres much more to this but I would tax your patience and mental energy to describe it all. On the Mexican side of the border the movie rolls out the familiar cliches sullen Mexicans sipping tequila in bars cars being hijacked under gringos noses extended scenes of desolate landscapes Spaghetti Western guitar licks here and there. You get the idea. Pitt has some very funny moments but hes the only attraction in a pretty mediocre sojourn in Mexico. Meanwhile in the gaming state its time for Julia to be Julia playing cute crying smiling widening her eyes puffing out that Firestone upper lip and occasionally dipping into that basso profundo voice for comedic effect. Its a familiar routine which she can do in her sleep; she almost does. Shes not nearly as funny or appealing as Gandolfini the star of ""The Sopranos"" a truly funny guy. Its his hangdog deadpan performance that makes her character look better which makes his look even better. When Samantha asks Leroy if hes going to kill her he replies ""Depends on too many variables to answer right now."" Of course much of the credit for the funny nuggets must go to J.H. Wymans script which makes ""The Mexican"" much more tolerable than it deserves to be. But for the most part the movie - thanks to the uber-presence of Pitt and Roberts - feels patently inauthentic. For one thing both stars spend most of the movie apart. Perhaps this is where all those agents and personal managers exercised their ""talents"" by making sure their clients got to strut their stuff individually while smaller marquee names provided ego-less backup. The result At no point do Jerry and Samantha seem romantically connected at all. And what is meant to be the movies biggest concern - together or not - becomes its smallest. ""The Mexican"" (R 123 minutes) - Contains violence and strong language.

(DreamWorks) Americas love affair with violence has seldom been so quirkily examined as in ""The Mexican"" an offbeat crime caper with Sam Peckinpahs prints all over it. The tale symbolically enough turns on the search for an antique pistol with a cupid-shaped hammer that slams into an engraving of a bosomy heart. According to legend anyone who ever fired the weapon died of a broken heart or cardiac arrest. Now a hapless bagman (Brad Pitt) and his temperamental girlfriend (Julia Roberts) seem fated to give it a shot. Never mind that they must take different paths to arrive at the same destination. ""The Mexican"" you see is actually two road movies his and hers. The tempestuous twosome are separated early in the story but they are so clearly crazy for each other that the passion lasts all movie long. They remain foremost in one anothers thoughts which both are inclined to share with anyone who will listen. Robertss Samantha finds a sympathetic ear in James Gandolfini as Leroy a conflicted hit man hired to snatch Samantha and hold her hostage till Jerry (Pitt) returns from Mexico with the much-coveted pistol. Samantha who has had it up to her exposed bellybutton with Jerrys Mafia ties is headed for Vegas to become a croupier when nabbed by Leroy. She protests to no avail that she just broke up with Jerry. Which she did in a scene familiar from countless romantic comedies She throws him out followed by his suitcase. But the segment is keenly written by J.H. Wyman and the actors play it with such relish - make that hot sauce - that the scene comes off as zesty if not quite original. As she psychobabbles to Leroy The problem is Jerry never has time for her. Here he promised to take her to Sin City and they were in couples therapy and he didnt learn a thing. So it was hasta la vista Jerry although she just cant seem to wash that man out of her big hair. Leroy one of the newfangled sensitive hoodlums has trouble with relationships himself and understands Samanthas frustrations too well. Soon hes staring into her picture-window eyes and confessing his innermost longings. Meanwhile south of the border Jerry has also discovered a new best friend in a slobbering junkyard dog who refuses to leave the bed of Jerrys hurriedly purchased used truck. Jerry is also a lovable bad guy yet unlike the sharpshooting Leroy he rarely finds his target. But make no mistake blood is spilled as the goofy gringo repeatedly loses and recovers the precious weapon. Pitt scruffy though blessedly unbattered is on leave from his bare-fisted persona. On the other hand hes still playing the rogue and despite the high jinks remains preoccupied with violence here. Like many of his recent films ""The Mexican"" would be an independent movie if Pitt not to mention the queen of popcorn cinema werent part of the picture. This is not your typical star vehicle. Both he and Roberts scrappy even a bit shrewish here took huge pay cuts to play opposite each other. While they do share togetherness she spends more time opposite Gandolfini than her leading man. (What the heck Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks didnt meet till the end of ""Sleepless in Seattle."") Although there are similarities between Gandolfinis Leroy and the capo he plays in HBOs ""The Sopranos"" he brings more tenderness to this tough-guy role. And like the hoodlums in ""Analyze This"" ""The Whole Nine Yards"" and ""Nurse Betty"" hes depicted heroically and the storys outcome depends on him. Gore Verbinski who previously directed the slapstick comedy ""Mouse Hunt"" successfully balances the action with the romance and the Gothic humor. Although the movie does seem to end on three separate occasions two of them are too Hollywood for eccentric partners in a low-budget movie. But the whole point of the exercise is to reunite Brad and Julia. ""The Mexican"" (123 minutes) is rated R for violence and language.

"USATODAY.com - Mexican goes south of boredom Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 08/09/2001 - Updated 0524 PM ET Mexican goes south of boredom By Mike Clark USA TODAY The Mexican (out of four) Stars Julia Roberts Brad Pitt James Gandolfini Bob Balaban J.K. Simmons Gene Hackman Director Gore Verbinski Distributor DreamWorks Rating R for violence and language Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt share two scenes early on in The Mexican just before a 75-minute stretch in which they never appear together. As a result the movie heads south in more than one sense. The couples first scene consists of some chaste bedroom affection meant to establish them as a devoted unwed couple and its a passage both promising and sweet. The second is more turbulent -- and the one in keeping with the true tone of their relationship. Angered that hes still married to the mob Roberts flings Pitts belongings off their apartments balcony at her bewildered boyfriend below. Its a scene so verbose and overextended that we sense the movie is already in trouble. And is it ever. Read more Related story Location turns Mexican into buddy film Video The Mexican trailer with Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt USA TODAYs Mike Clark reviews The Mexican Photo Gallery Scenes from south of the border Julia Roberts Weve all seen countless shaggy-dog stories whose payoffs turn out to be puny after two hours of screen time. This ones more like a shaggy-pistola yarn dealing with the bad luck that follows Pitts inept gofer when hes ordered by his employers to retrieve a vintage gun from Mexico. The weapons supposedly immense value is never adequately explained though director Gore Verbinski tries to give historical context to the prized firearm in some sepia-toned flashbacks that look like something out of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. While Pitt finds loses then searches again for the elusive ""Mexican"" in various hellholes (in scenes intended to be funny) Roberts is planning her exit from L.A. to her new life in Las Vegas -- while stewing the entire time. The story gets more complicated -- which isnt synonymous with more interesting -- when shes abducted by a sensitive hit man (James Gandolfini) who also has been dispatched by competing thugs to find the gun. Playing off his popular gangster persona Tony Soprano Gandolfini is a schlump whose schlumpiness is supposed to make his sporadic acts of violence all the more shocking. But most of what follows (from him and from others) is standard screen gun play shootings in public restrooms killings in hotel rooms someone shooting someone else in the foot. When Roberts and Pitt finally reunite -- far too late -- they work extremely hard to make up for lost time. Yet what little enjoyment there is comes from other sources the chemistry between Roberts and Gandolfini handsome Panavision photography of dingy surroundings by Dark Citys Dariusz Wolski and an unbilled Gene Hackman cameo. Superstars usually avoid movies this spiritless and its tough to believe anyone could read this script and fail to realize the movie wouldnt end up going anywhere. If Roberts ever gets a lifetime achievement award this may be one movie the shows producers choose to leave out of the retrospective clip show.

Starring Julia Roberts Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini. Directed by Gore Verbinski. (R. 123 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Everybodys already awarded the Oscar to Julia Roberts. She might as well get Brad Pitt too. What more could a woman want? Well a better movie would be nice. Thank God for James Gandolfini. As a lovelorn hit man Gandolfini and his melancholy puss raise the interest level of every scene they share in ""The Mexican"" a dark comedy set in the brilliant sunshine of Mexico and Las Vegas. But Roberts and her belly button are just about to knock ""Hannibal"" off the top spot at the box office this weekend. She plays a frayed-around-the-edges thrift-shop beauty named Samantha who needs to learn when enough is enough with her feckless boyfriend Jerry a mob gofer who has trouble expressing his feelings. Theyve already been through group. Pitt is the screw-up Jerry who is given one last chance by his bosses and sent to pick up some kind of gun in Mexico. Its me or the mob says Samantha. She just wants to go to Las Vegas and find a job in a casino. What we have here is a failure to communicate. Someone should communicate to Pitt that this role is supposed to be loopier. It seems effortless for him too effortless and it shows. It sags. Roberts on the other hand is too often an annoying bundle of tics and mannerisms as Samantha heads several directions at once blurts out half-baked phrases and finally meanders back to a conclusion which she pounces on with certainty. Shes all fingers and elbows. Shes twiggy. As killers go Gandolfini is a sweetheart. Even after he takes Samantha hostage the big lugs presence is oddly soothing. Samantha has his number and a scene between Roberts and Gandolfini in a truck-stop cafe on the way to Vegas is the best in the movie. It raises this shaggy-dog story into the realm of delight in the telling which is where it needs to be all the way through. As Samantha and Jerry go their separate ways Roberts actually has more face time with Gandolfini than with Pitt and the ""Sopranos"" star brings out the best in her. Hes the reason to see this movie. The hit man Leroy finds it necessary to remind people from time to time that hes a professional. He knows what hes doing. He also has unexpected depths. ""You gotta find a way to expand the qualities he has in sex to other areas of your relationship"" he advises Samantha about her boyfriend and its clear hes speaking from experience in the relationship department too. One of the jokes is that the mobsters here by and large are completely ordinary working stiffs except for that little streak of cold-bloodedness. The Mexican in ""The Mexican"" is an antique silver-plated gun that has a curse on it. It sometimes seems as if the gang that couldnt shoot straight meets the gun that couldnt shoot straight but anybody who buys that is asking for trouble. Periodically ""The Mexican"" pauses for mock-heroic flashbacks of the guns legend. Mostly though the tone is supposed to be but not often enough is two-bit gangland mordant. Where is Elmore Leonard when we need him? Advisory Contains violence.

Hard-to-categorize pic reps a dream B.O. teaming of Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts even though the two stars are deglamorized in this context . Boasting far more star power than substance ""The Mexican"" is an intensely whimsical shaggy-dog crime story that ricochets between goofy violence and some endearing personal moments. Hard-to-categorize pic which will have buffs thinking Peckinpah or Tarantino lite reps a dream B.O. teaming of Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts even though the two stars are deglamorized in this context and only appear together at the beginning and toward the end. Slight but enjoyable DreamWorks release looks to generate hefty late-winter returns. Mixing moods like crazy and delighting in tough-guy talk as well as jargon-loaded therapyspeak script by J.H. Wyman (""Pale Saints"") sends its beautiful protags off in two opposite directions when the lovebirds take a ""time out"" from their squabbling. Doofus Jerry (Pitt) a crimeland errand boy in deep to the mob after having caused an auto accident that landed kingpin Margolese in prison is forced by milquetoasty lieutenant Nayman (Bob Balaban) to do a ""last job"" -- to recover a legendary 19th-century pistol called ""The Mexican"" in a small south-of-the-border town. Why remotely self-respecting gangsters would send an oaf like Jerry on any mission remains a question throughout. Jerry seems to have lucky and unlucky streaks that balance each other out On the one hand upon arriving in San Miguel he manages to get his hands on the gun in remarkably short order; on the other the man he gets it from is killed by a stray bullet falling from the sky and Jerry is left high and dry when his car and the gun are stolen almost immediately thereafter. That all this is not meant to be taken with the utmost seriousness is indicated by Pitts deliberately broad comic playing by the caricaturing of ""sinister"" Mexico as seen from a gringo p.o.v. and by Alan Silvestris jaunty score which with its whistling refrains conjures up memories of Ennio Morricones great Western soundtracks. Just as Jerry is contemplating a longer stay in Mexico than he bargained for Samantha (Roberts) whos furious at Jerry for ""selfishly"" taking a job he was coerced into heads for Las Vegas with vague professional plans. Almost at once shes accosted in a ladies room by a gun-toting man (Sherman Augustus) who is himself shot down by beefy hitman Leroy (James Gandolfini) who kidnaps Sam as a hedge against Jerry completing his mission. After exhausting her futile protests that she and Jerry have split up Sam whos like a heat-seeking missile where personal issues are concerned gets tough guy Leroy to start opening up. ""Youre a very sensitive person for a cold-blooded killer"" Sam compliments him and it isnt long before Sam in perhaps the films best scene noses out the information that this ruthless assassin is actually gay that he is emotionally vulnerable and has never been able to keep a relationship together. This aspect compounded by the casting of ""The Sopranos"" tough-guy Gandolfini might have threatened to come off as a mere stunt but the actors make it not only credible but touching and winning the most genuine thing in the picture. Roberts is especially good in communicating the thrill that Sam takes in her own intuition about Leroy while Gandolfini embodying but going way beyond the thug stuff creates a character rather like a gay version of Paddy Chayevskys Marty a loser in love who is genuinely surprised that someone else might take an interest in him. Pics ping-ponging structure renders every transition like a chapter heading -- ""Meanwhile back in Mexico..."" -- and Jerrys ever-changing fortunes find him quickly moving from getting about by donkey to daringly retaking his car from its thief to being arrested by a corrupt cop. Latter is one of three men who in the course of the film relates a distinct version of the fabled guns cursed history which is shown in sepia silent-movie style. As if realizing that a fools errand cant be expected to hold interest forever Wyman and director Gore Verbinski finally tighten the screws a bit after 90 minutes as all the surviving participants come together in Mexico to bring the gun search and the central romance to some resolution. Even here the notes struck are alternately rough facetious and a little bit sad. Although theyve lucky to have survived to have this reunion Jerry and Sam cant resist immediately laying into one another while it takes none other than an unbilled Gene Hackman as criminal kingpin Margolese to explain why this wild goose chase had to happen at all. Verbinskis direction is loose fluid and attractive and the entire cast seems to be having a grand time. Looking fine but college-age scruffy Pitt is constantly doing pirouettes trying to contend with all the twists of fate that sneak up behind his character while Roberts submerges the glamour-puss stuff as much as humanly possible for her to give a lively reading of a mentally limited but lively working-class woman. Aside from Gandolfinis outstanding supporting turn J.K. Simmons creates a fresh characterization as a mob functionary who takes a time-card-punching approach to his job. Silvestris deliberately derivative score which is accompanied by some well-chosen tunes reps a major plus. Tech package as a whole is tops and main location of Real de Catorce a small city in northern Mexico supplies great character and unusual visual opportunities.

Wyman; Producer (group) Newmarket Capital Group Pistolero Productions; Release Date Wide 03/02/2001; Runtime (in minutes) 123; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Dreamworks Distribution L.L.C. Posted March 2 2001 -- 1200 AM EST Gore Verbinski who directed The Mexican is a TV commercial auteur whose award winning reel includes the first Budweiser talking frogs spot. (Verbinski stretched as an artist in his feature directorial debut reaching out to rodents in ""Mouse Hunt."") Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts on the other hand who star in ""The Mexican"" are top of the food chain - theyre BRAD amp; JULIA prince and princess of Hollywood brought together for the first time in a historic union of box office royalty. And heres where worlds collide Every now and then when this picaresque caper loses its way you can imagine Pitt and Roberts each posed prettily on a lily pad ribbitting BRAD. JULIA. BRAD. JULIA. You can envision them basking especially when the mournful flourishes of the soundtracks Mexican trumpets fall in a decrescendo of tinny cliches. And when the atmospheric scenes of dark eyed kids waving sparklers blur from overuse. And when all the ancillary characters up to no particular good for no particular reason become wearisome. And when you cant tell whether Verbinski is going for romance comedy or a Nike ad. BRAD. JULIA. BRAD. JULIA. He smiles. She smiles. He squabbles charmingly with her. She scrabbles delightfully with him. In a flick of the tongue theyve pulled in more ticket buyers. Do they entertain? Yes as movie stars can costumed in eye catching amber and umber and ruby colored T shirts staging a ""scene"" in which a pair of lovers ""fight"" or ""flee bad guys."" Do they create characters worth caring about - i.e. does Pitt convince us that he really is a conflicted Mob bagman named Jerry and that he really is in danger when hes sent south of the border from Las Vegas to retrieve a valuable antique pistol called ""the Mexican"" and that Roberts as his girlfriend Samantha really is so committed to better communication with her man that she drags him to group therapy and that the intrinsically adorable duo are crazy in bickering love? Ribbit. This would be Peckinpah wannabe Tarantino could be Gilliam story with its contemporary ironic dodges and feints is after all made for a pair of stars with a quarter of the worldwide luster of BRAD amp; JULIA. Literally. The nuts and bolts original script by J.H. Wyman was first envisioned for relative unknowns who would have been free to play the fun frenetic heck out of hellishly in over their heads Jerry and Sam. Even somewhat knowns (Billy Crudup and Samantha Morton?) or better knowns (Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock?) might have had a clearer shot than best knowns at freeing Jerry and Sam from the ennui of the scripts larkiness and disposable irony Bob Balaban plays a control freak Mob heavy Ozs J.K. Simmons a neurotic Mob sidekick - are there no more happy go lucky wiseguys left on screen? (Theres also a requisite deadpan Mexican car rental agent pawnbroker grandmother and smart dog.) Alternatively BRAD amp; JULIA might have made a perfectly okay B size product - but for the striking A level performance of James Gandolfini as Leroy a complex anti ironic hitman who kidnaps Samantha to further ensure the guns safe return. (The pistol by the way has a tragic curse attached to it not counting the curse of calling forth scenes of old timey Mexican drama that seem to have been swept off the cutting room floor of ""All the Pretty Horses."") Its not the fault of ""The Sopranos"" charismatic beefy star that hes an actor of such substance and quiet ardor as to make idle movie star ribbitting look frivolous. But from the moment he enters the story in a wordless scene involving Samantha a highway rest stop toilet stall and a gun Leroy ups the ante - and ups our hopes for a story with true grit. (Samantha clearly responds to his gravitas.) Leroy is hands down the person we care about most and when hes not on screen the tortilla flatness of ""The Mexican"" becomes even more frustrating. ""Im here to regulate funkiness"" he explains to his hostage but really what Gandolfini demonstrates is how one powerful player can regulate the thermostat of an entire film. Not only is the actor who currently rules pop culture as Tony Soprano able to step believably into a new characters skin but hes also able to calm the leading ladys itchy skin In her scenes opposite Gandolfini Roberts hops far from her lily pad to a place thats the closest to emotional truth were going to see from her Samantha and the communication between hostage and hostage taker takes ""The Mexican"" at least for a time to an exciting place. (Albert Finney knew how to draw exciting work from Roberts in ""Erin Brockovich"" too; I see an award winning future for her playing opposite tough guys.) Then its back to frogland again and cute scenes with Pitt and a doggy. Croak.
