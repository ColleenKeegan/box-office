A high-profile terrorism case unexpectedly binds together two ex-lovers on the defense team - testing the limits of their loyalties and placing their lives in jeopardy. (Photo/Video Focus Features) By John Anderson Aug. 29 2013 359 p.m. ET An enormously watchable thriller about terrorism personal ethics and governmental malfeasance ""Closed Circuit"" is also a movie with a very British politesse At no time will anyone fear that the fate of the world is actually at stake. Its a romance after all albeit one with a serious political agenda. John Crowley who directed ""Boy A"" actor Andrew Garfields breakout movie and one of the more touching films of 2007 eschews what would ordinarily be cinematic virtues--a decided point of view for example or a consistency of time--in favor of entertainment. But even though its pacing is erratic ""Closed Circuit"" is also fairly propulsive enabling Mr. Crowley to keep his audiences eyes engaged with a very attractive cast to help him do it. The film begins with a blunt assault on its viewers central nervous system We see Londons popular and well-populated Borough Market via as many as eight closed-circuit monitors which subdivide the screen and provoke considerable tension. Somethings going to happen. Where am I supposed to look? If youre concentrating on the lady with the shopping bag youll miss the exploding truck which kills scores injures more and presents British higher-ups with a potential political catastrophe It may have been their fault. Arrested immediately and with little explanation is Farroukh Erdogan ( Denis Moschitto) a Turkish national who had spent time in Germany and who despite a drug bust was allowed into Britain. Why? Such is the key to the story. Its probably fortunate that Mr. Moschitto is a German of Italian descent because Farroukh is an almost comically cliched example of the movie terrorist sallow shifty and just incidentally a heroin addict whose own son (the solid young Hasancan Cifci) turns against him. Making Farroukh more sympathetic however would have trivialized the films message which is that changes to Western criminal justice since 9/11--the ease for example in which information becomes classified and questioning of policy is deemed treasonous--have not only rendered those systems unjust but ripe for abuse by the state. As the voice of ruthless bureaucratic pragmatism Jim Broadbent as the British attorney general is pretty close to perfect. ENLARGE Eric Bana in Closed Circuit Focus Features Our rodent-like terrorist has troubles certainly but he also has what may be the best-looking defense team in the history of English jurisprudence Claudia Simmons-Howe ( Rebecca Hall) who will be his special advocate and Martin Rose ( Eric Bana) who is asked to step in as barrister after the apparent suicide of his clients previous counsel. Readers will be asking at this point ""Who is Farroukhs solicitor?"" That would be Devlin (a beautifully rumpled Ciaran Hinds) who like many of the principals in ""Closed Circuit"" does his best to illuminate the vagaries of the British trial system and criminal law in general. The films usually first-rate screenwriter Steven Knight (""Dirty Pretty Things"" ""Eastern Promises"") pulls a few fast ones such as having an angry Martin facetiously reciting to nettlesome reporter Joanna Reece ( Julia Stiles) the facts of the case which amounts to plain old exposition in disguise. It doesnt help that the dialogue is graceless. The framework of the story is not so complicated although a spoiler alert seems prudent Farroukh was being mismanaged as it were by the British secret service MI5 He went rogue aided the cell behind the bombing and used government money to do it. No one in the upper levels of government wants that information made public and by threatening to expose it Claudia and Martin put their lives in jeopardy. The premise of ""Closed Circuit"" is a rather cavalier indictment of the U.K.s clandestine services but one apparently inspired by the current realities of prosecuting terrorists. As Farroukhs defense barrister Martin will operate in open court. As special advocate Claudia will argue behind closed doors and once shes heard the classified information that supports the governments case against her client shell be forbidden from communicating it to Martin or even speaking to him--which presents no great problem at first since both are nursing bruises from their nastily concluded affair which has left Martin with an unquenched adoration of his co-counsel. No one will blame him--or her for circumventing the law. ""Closed Circuit"" is a film in which the cynicism is far more convincing than any of its faint stabs at optimism which resides almost entirely in the sure-to-be-resuscitated romance between Claudia and Martin. Their nobility is as assured as the fatalism of the films core story but Mr. Bana and Ms. Hall two actors who emanate both intelligence and heat are a balm to the soul. Getaway A week that began with one ex-Disney Channel star twerking her way to infamy ends with another Selena Gomez trying to hot-wire her movie career with ""Getaway"" director Courtney Solomons video game disguised as a major motion picture. Neither decision seems very wise. And by the way why is everyone in ""Getaway"" in Bulgaria? Because filmmaking there is cheap and apparently so are automobiles which expire by the dozens during the movies 90 minutes of racing through the streets of Sofia. Watch a clip from the film ""Getaway."" Former race-car driver Brent Magna (Ethan Hawke) is pitted against the clock when his wife is kidnapped by a mysterious villain. Also starring Selena Gomez and Jon Voight. (Photo/Video Warner Bros) Ms. Gomez late of Disneys ""Wizards of Waverly Place"" and now a music star as well is a peculiarly dyspeptic co-star to Ethan Hawke who plays Brent Magna a failed race-car driver who comes home one day to find his Christmas tree trashed and his wife abducted. In order to get her back alive he has to steal a customized car from a parking garage--a locale that provides not only an introductory chase scene but a showcase for Brents prowess behind the wheel--and then follow to the letter the instructions he receives through the autos computerized dashboard. Its ""Speed"" obviously crossed with ""The Fast and the Furious"" with just a hint of early Milos Forman. For many many minutes there is no sense of why the wife Leanne ( Rebecca Budig) was kidnapped or what scheming lay behind the mysterious voice with the generic Eastern European accent ( Jon Voight). But after several hair-raising pursuits by the Sofia police Brent finds himself at the business end of an enormous automatic pistol wielded by Ms. Gomezs character called The Kid who wants his car. Which is actually her car. Its probably not what the filmmaker planned but in her hoodie and wielding that cannon Ms. Gomez looks like a delinquent chipmunk. Its all you can do not to laugh. Oh go ahead. But be forewarned that there are many miles to go before we get to the end and it will feel like an eternity before any of it makes sense. ENLARGE Selena Gomez and Ethan Hawke in Getaway Warner Bros. Pictures None of us really knows how we would act if a spouse were abducted by gangsters in a former Eastern Bloc country where the authorities cant even set up an effective dragnet. But you sense it wouldnt match the picture we get from Mr. Hawke who cant quite maintain the level of panic necessary to convince us his wife is really being held hostage. He does have a nicely ravaged look these days although it plays oddly with Ms. Gomez whose facial contours are remarkably evocative of those of a petulant infant. Mr. Hawke by contrast seems positively electrifying. Afternoon Delight This is clearly the summer of the reality-based woman. First we got Greta Gerwig in ""Frances Ha"" and then Lake Bell and the brightly comic ""In a World..."" and now comes Kathryn Hahn already a comedy cult figure proving herself to be a dramatic actress of remarkable depth. Maybe she cant save Jill Soloways ""Afternoon Delight"" either from its nonsensical title or contrived narrative but her efforts to reconcile the warring factions inside her characters head is a thing to behold. Watch a clip from the film ""Afternoon Delight."" Frustrated stay-at-home mom Rachel (Kathryn Hahn) wants to spice up her marriage and meets a stripper (Juno Temple) whom she adopts as a live-in nanny. Also starring Josh Radnor. (Photo/Video Film Arcade) The narrative of ""Afternoon Delight"" (yes it shares its title with the 1976 Top-40 hit by the unlamented Starland Vocal Band) is less a storyline than a laundry line on which its director has hung a load of high-end female problems. Rachel (Ms. Hahn) is in a stagnant marriage to Jeff ( Josh Radnor of televisions ""How I Met Your Mother"") who has invented an app that allows his wife and child to live in the lap of luxury. While Jeff spends every waking hour at his computer Rachel is bored out of her skull to the point that she and girlfriend Stephanie ( Jessica St. Clair) require extreme entertainment--in pursuit of which their husbands take them to a strip club where pushing matters a step too far each buys his wife a lap dance. ENLARGE Kathryn Hahn in Afternoon Delight. Film Arcade At this point uncertainty is director Soloways friend. Rachels enigmatic fascination with McKenna ( Juno Temple) the stripper with whom she has an intimate if not pornographic encounter hasnt yet had a chance to evolve. So the viewer is in a state of suspended awe Has Rachel suddenly discovered her true sexuality? Is that whats at the root of her sexless marriage? Can she be so clueless as to think she can take a self-described ""full-service sex worker"" home like a kitten without her own comfortable world coming apart? Apparently. But until things dont quite work they work quite well with Ms. Temple operating at pitch-perfect tone as the movies guileless waifish hooker and Ms. Hahn journeying through Rachels metamorphosis with just the right amount of longing confusion and her own adroit comic sense. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE Our Idiot Brother (2011) Director Jesse Peretz surrounded his star Paul Rudd with an exemplary team of comedy sidekicks including Zooey Deschanel Elizabeth Banks Steve Coogan Emily Mortimer Adam Scott and Kathryn Hahn who is delightfully loathsome as the self-righteous hippie girlfriend of Ned Rudds holy fool and lovable truth-teller. Released from jail after a guileless pot sale to a police officer Ned returns home only to be evicted by Janet (who wont even give him his dog back) moves into his mothers house complicates his sisters already screwy lives and provides a satisfying degree of blissed-out comedy. ENLARGE The Town (2010) Directed by Ben Affleck this kinetic caper-thriller commits misdemeanor after misdemeanor but is elevated out of its Southie Boston torpor by two key performances-- Jeremy Renner whose felonious James Coughlin is the wingnut buddy of robbery mastermind Doug MacRay (Mr. Affleck); and Rebecca Hall whose Claire Keesey is a woman for whom many men would cheerfully rob a bank. The weak link in the cast is Mr. Affleck himself but the film he made just before ""Argo"" is exciting propulsive rich in Bostonian atmosphere and Ms. Hall is a wonder. ENLARGE Boy A (2007) Andrew (""The Amazing Spider-Man"") Garfield was just another slender good-looking British import when he starred in this delicately constructed drama from ""Closed Circuit"" director John Crowley. Inspired by Englands 1993 James Bulger case in which two 10-year-olds abducted and murdered a 2-year-old boy it is based on the novel by Jonathan Trigell who speculated what might have happened to one of the perpetrators after a lengthy incarceration. The screenplay is by Mark ORowe and Mr. Garfield shows sensitivity and craft in bringing the character on the page Jack Burridge to tormented life.

"License to Bore << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous The Death of Bob Kalsu  Next Donald Trump Licked My Flesh Part 1 Courtesy of Warner Bros. Facebook Twitter Print License to Bore Getaway stalls out and The Grandmaster kicks itself senseless by Wesley Morris on August 30 2013 Im not someone who derives satisfaction from solving a movies plot before the movie solves it for me. Im paying for the satisfaction of surprise. Im paying for a movie to mock my sense of cleverness or compound it with some cleverness of its own. Youre always five scenes ahead of Getaway and its exasperating. Euro-baddies have kidnapped the wife of a traumatized former race car driver (Ethan Hawke) and commanded him by cell phone to steal a Mustang rigged with surveillance cameras and drive it around Bulgaria in a way that causes maximum chaos. If he refuses theyll kill her. But he has no idea what their ultimate goal is. Hes the labor. Its not long until Selena Gomez hops into the passenger seat (she happens to be the cars rightful owner and she appears to be wearing a Tigers baseball cap). Gomez explains the technology pulling Hawkes strings (she happens to be a computer genius too). First she does so with the exasperation of a tween teaching her dad to text. Then she does it with the relief of an actor who remembered her lines (""Its not encrypted its uploaded to a public server""). Anyway now if she gets out the car the wife still dies. Once Gomez deduces what all this driving is about and tells Hawke what her father does for a living and seems to have put the bad guys whole scheme together you start to change your mind about what an obnoxious brat shes been because she cracked the case. But instead of making it all explicit she says ""I just wish I knew what he was after."" This is not what you want to hear from a woman initially famous for her TV wizardry. But if Gomez were allowed to be as smart in this movie as she would be while watching it Getaway would last 35 minutes. As it is this hour and a half reeks of contractual obligation. Why were Hawke and his non-Bulgarian wife living in Sofia in the first place? Was their tax break as good as the one for the film? The production couldnt have enjoyed outstanding police protection since the depiction of Bulgarian law enforcement makes the Keystone Kops seem like the FBI. The whole movie should end after Hawkes first driving stunt since no police department would allow that car to get away. Yet that Mustang escapes again and again and again. When a pair of officers gets close Hawke drives into a cul-de-sac and shuts off the engine. And they dont see him. The bad guys have more success chasing that Mustang than the police do. If the movie is as much a commercial for the Mustang Shelby GT500 as it appears be sure to ask your dealer for the model thats indestructible bulletproof and never runs out of gas. If movies need us to suspend disbelief you have to supply your own clothes hangers for Getaway. The budget is an alleged 18 million but that cant be right. Half the film has been shot with webcams. Nothing that looks this terrible should cost even 18000. This is a movie that makes gruel of better hits -- Die Hard Taken Drive nearly anything with Jason Statham. But in each of those vehicles the star got to demonstrate starriness. You keep waiting for the film to let Hawke flash some wit or grit but he doesnt. Gomez isnt the actor he is but shes been given more to do. Shes the hero; the child of Sandra Bullock in Speed. But even that feels more like an accident than a strategy. The director is a Canadian schlock producer named Courtney Solomon. Instead of devising a visual strategy he just randomly dropped cameras and used whatever they captured. That explains why the movies villain -- whos shown from behind hunched over a laptop but mostly from the nostrils down once or twice sipping a martini (the identity of this person is withheld either as a source of suspense or an act of integrity) -- is filmed from multiple angles that reveal only an editors indecisiveness. Most action sequences now rely on an abundance of edits. But Ive never seen a movie in which so much of that action is just editing (its credited to Ryan Dufrene). There are two decent chases. Ones between the Mustang and a guy on a motorbike with a gun at the site of a commuter rail station. But that ends in the sort of explosive overkill that says ""You guys weve only spent 1 million so far"" The other chase has the Mustang trailing an SUV at dawn and its exciting because its a single take in which the driving and stunt coordination feel intentionally under-rehearsed. It feels real. You can hear the shifting of gears and the revving of motors. The shot is exciting because your nerves are being properly jangled rather than shredded. But it just doesnt culminate with anything exciting the way it might have with an artist like Nicolas Winding Refn or an absurdist whose commercial instincts are as uncanny as Luc Bessons. You never sense with Getaway that youre in the hands of a competent director. You feel like youre behind the wheel with a hack. Wong Kar-wais The Grandmaster tells the story of Bruce Lees martial-arts teacher the legendary Ip Man (Tony Leung) and its almost as incoherent as Getaway. But the movies problems are in part those of a great artist trying something new. Its a fine mess. There are a half-dozen endings and the passage of time -- from 1930s China to Hong Kong in the 1940s and 50s then back to China -- doesnt happen with any kind of drama or urgency. Instead its marked by the insertion of place cards that explain exactly how that time has passed. We dont get war. We get text telling us that war happened people died and its no longer the 1930s. But amid all the disjointedness is some of the luminosity and lusciousness one expects from the director of Ashes of Time Chungking Express Happy Together In the Mood for Love and 2046. The Grandmaster runs on a diet of ellipses and slow motion and unconsummated attraction. It is very much the Wong experience in that sense. His attempt to make both a biographical film and a martial arts movie are another matter and a lot of whats interesting about the movie involves the experience of a director applying his trademarks to such a well-established genre in the same way that his fascinating but unsuccessful debut in English 2007s My Blueberry Nights applied his sensibility to what ultimately was a nighttime soap opera. His way inside Ips life is through the sort of repressed love story Wong prefers. What appears to be both a tale of territorial martial arts mastery (north versus south) and differing combat styles is distilled down to something more intimate than epic. Ip whos from Southern China butts heads first philosophically with the Northern veteran Gong Yutian (Wang Qingxiang) and then with Gongs daughter Gong Er (Zhang Ziyi). After her father loses to Ip she pledges to defend her familys honor with a duel. The film is given the arc of an important persons story beginning near the end of Ips life and ending at the beginning and these tutorial fights -- the lessons -- are the source of the action. The tussle between Ip and Gong Er isnt the films first. Wong shows Ip preparing for a showdown with Gong pere as a series of preparatory contests. The names and disciplines of Ips more seasoned opponents appear in a top corner of the screen (Leung by the way is 51 but he continues to age in the opposite direction) and they partake in a robustly choreographed exchange of fists feet and forearms. Ips encounters with Gong Er are something else. Whoever is the first to break a piece of furniture in their housebound duel loses. Its an exercise in violence predicated in high Wong Kar-wai fashion upon restraint. There is comedy in the near misses but theres also absurd heat like when she goes sailing over him and her face comes within millimeters of his. Ip and Gong Er should have become lovers but you know how it is. War honor and spouses Theyre always in the way. In this case the war is the Second Sino-Japanese War and when it arrives at Ips door in 1938 he moves himself his wife and his children to Hong Kong. The film is at its most incoherent at this point. The place cards explain the tragedies that have befallen him. He reunites with Gong Er but shes a changed woman her spunk snuffed. A flashback to 10 years earlier explains why and you have to fight to stay with the scrambled calendar. You also have to fight the disappointment that Zhang has put away the wild and wildish things of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon; Rush Hour 2; House of Flying Daggers; 2046; or the all-Mandarin version of Dangerous Liaisons. Zhang is so committed to patrician suffering that she even fights with a frown. Nonetheless this is a character the martial arts universe rarely sees a woman whose skill surpasses some men but whose sense of decency forces her to keep that superiority and her ""64 Hands"" technique to herself. Asked at some point to break her pledge she says ""Heaven would know. Earth would know. My father would know."" The only way Jane Wyman could have improved on that line would have been if Douglas Sirk made movies in Mandarin. The Grandmaster has its partisans. Some of them are Wong loyalists. But he fills me with ambivalence. His lugubriousness can be enervating and his interest in things left unsaid and untouched is the sexual equivalent of being stuck in traffic You can see your exit you just cant get off. His intensely rapturous imagery doesnt come all the way through here and neither do most of the supporting characters. Theres some sex and comedy in the fighting. And the rustling of moving fabric is unlike any rustling youve ever heard (and for 17.50 in Dolby Atmos it should be). The movies been shot digitally and some images have the lush surfaces of certain watercolors; some look as if the paper has refused the paint. The version being released in North American theaters by the Weinstein Company is shorter by at least 20 minutes than its popular Chinese counterpart. I dont know what the excised minutes include but they seem crucial.

This latter-day B movie can be rather fun in its preposterousness and bargain-basement style. The story takes place in Bulgaria for no other reason than its cheap to shoot there (though the filmmakers use the locations effectively) and some of the villains demands evoke the illogic of a bad dream. As usual Hawke brings more seriousness to the pulpy material than it probably deserves. Whether out of integrity or perversity he refuses to phone in a performance no matter how unpromising the role. Courtney Solomon directed; with Selena Gomez and Jon Voight.

"Getaway | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; getaway ) Getaway (United States/Bulgaria 2013) August 30 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Getaway is pretty much a 90-minute car chase. Thats it. It may rival The Blues Brothers for the most vehicular wreckage in a motion picture. (Is that still the gold standard or has it been surpassed?) That said however consider how easy it is for a five-minute car chase to grow boring if the director doesnt bring something interesting to the proceedings. Now multiply that by 18. Getaway starts out with some flair getting its backstory across economically through quick flashbacks. Ethan Hawke is in the car before the opening credits are done and he stays there until we get to the end credits. (Okay he gets out briefly once or twice in between.) The ""high energy"" approach of director Courtney Solomon (the man who brought Dungeons amp; Dragons to the screen) quickly becomes monotonous. There are about five shots that Solomon uses repeatedly. Theres nothing notable or interesting about the locations of the chases - the majority of them are through crowded city streets or on less crowded freeways. Theres a lot of swerving ramming and causing other vehicles to crash into one another. All of this stuff is generic material that was common in the 80s and 90s. Earlier this summer I complained about the physics-defying highway activity in Fast amp; Furious 6 but that at least had an element of invention thats completely absent here. The narrative exists exclusively to justify the chase. Its unnecessarily convoluted and when considered with any degree of intelligence makes no sense whatsoever. A former race car driver Brett Magna (Hawke) has been ""recruited"" by a faceless mastermind (Jon Voight) to accomplish a variety of nefarious missions in order to save his kidnapped wife (Rebecca Budig). Along the way Brett is carjacked (sort of) by a young woman (Selena Gomez) who ends up in the car with him for the duration. They argue for a while before some bonding starts. The screenwriter spent as little time on dialogue and character interaction as he did on narrative. This isnt about all that stuff. Its about a car going really fast while eluding other cars (mostly police). And this goes on... and on...and on. As long as Ethan Hawke continues to make movies with Julie Delpy and Richard Linklater Ill forgive him cash-grabs like this and The Purge. I realize that he like all of us has bills to pay. I guess this is intended to be the next step in Selena Gomezs evolution as an actress but its not a positive one. Okay she says ""shit"" a lot which I suppose is intended to position her in a more ""adult"" mode (Disney princesses dont use profanity after all) but her acting is about as one-note as her expression. Since she showed promise in Spring Breakers however it may be a case of a performance that fits the material. Jon Voight gets a bargain since for the most part his face is off-camera meaning he can claim it wasnt really him. I suspect even those who get a charge out of the most generic of car chases may find that Getaway offers too much of a good thing. The movie includes about 60 seconds of near-brilliance when the perspective suddenly goes into point-of-view mode. For that glorious minute there are no (obvious) cuts and things actually get exciting as were placed on the front grille while the car zips through red lights speeds around corners and weaves through traffic. One could argue that the inclusion of this sequence is a very bad idea because it italicizes how pedestrian the rest of the movie is. While Im sure Getaway could have benefitted from a better screenplay what it really lacks is variety. The experience-killer isnt the stupidity of the script the poor performance by Gomez or the idiocy of the dialogue. Its the sheer boredom of watching a neverending chase that lacks the slightest element of invention. Getaway isnt action; its inertia. Getaway is a classic Labor Day weekend movie meaning that the studio has minimal expectations for its box office performance and it doesnt demand that viewers pay even rudimentary attention to whats on-screen. You can take a 45-minute nap and not miss anything. In fact the trailer is an excellent encapsulation of the film - better to watch that and skip a trip to the theater since the only thing youll get for your 10 is a bigger picture and a lot more of the same.

It was at the time of the shows May release both a crafty recurring gag and a remarkably insidious earworm. But who imagined that it would also prove to be a prescient work of film criticism?Related Story The Worlds End An Apocalyptic Delight Im tempted to leave it at that when it comes to Getaway the new Selena Gomez vehicle (as in she stars in the movie and spends almost all of it inside an automobile). But on behalf of the morbidly curious I will describe its manifold deficiencies--yeah sorry about that one--at slightly greater length.The would-be B-movie tells the story of Brent Magna (Ethan Hawke) a former racecar driver who comes home to his apartment one afternoon to discover that his wife (Rebecca Budig) has been abducted. (More felonious than the kidnapping itself is the degree to which the opening scenes pilfer thematically and stylistically from The Fugitive.) His cell phone rings and a cartoonishly accented man instructs him ""Listen carefully. Your wife has been taken. At 430 p.m. you will go to the parking garage. There you will find a very special car. You will know which it is. Steal it."" The voice continues down the usual checklist there are cameras inside the car so Magnas every move will be monitored; if he contacts the police or disobeys any commands his wife will be killed etc. etc.The car he steals is an armor-plated Shelby Mustang Super Snake and the ""missions"" he is told to perform mostly involve the incitement of seemingly random vehicular mayhem on the streets of Sofia Bulgaria where the movie takes place. In the early going Magna picks up a passenger (identified solely as ""The Kid"" and played by Gomez) a poor-little-rich-girl and computer whiz to whom the car belonged before he stole it. (Why exactly she needed an armored muscle car is one of many mysteries the film declines to plumb.)The only participant to emerge with its reputation intact--though not its paint job--is the Shelby Mustang which also delivers the films most nuanced and psychologically complex performance.What follows is a breakneck race to see which primary character can prove most irritating to viewers. Theres Hawke who as an actor flirts with insufferability on his best days; Gomez who plays her character with the artless sulk of someone 21 going on 15; and ""The Voice"" (Jon Voight literally phoning it in) who nags Magna as incessantly as Katherina in The Taming of the Shrew ""Youre running out of time"" ""Not much time Mr. Magna."" In the end Id give the victory to Gomez by a nose. But really the only participant to emerge with its reputation intact--though not its paint job--is the Shelby Mustang which also delivers the films most nuanced and psychologically complex performance.For the first 10 or perhaps even 15 minutes theres a hint of quick-cut urgency to Getaway which was directed by Courtney Solomon (Dungeons amp; Dragons An American Haunting) from a script by rookies Sean Finegan and Gregg Maxwell Parker. We watch tires squeal on cobbled streets; we zoom in for hideous close-ups of The Voice (his moistly gristled lips and yellow teeth his designer eyewear); and we listen to the braying wee-wah wee-wah of European police sirens before they are crunchingly silenced by collision with the Shelby. And then more tires more Voice more sirens more crunches. And then more. Though vehicular accidents are generally broken down into five broad categories--head-on sideswipe rear-end T-bone and rollover--Solomon unveils countless variations on each theme over the course of his movies historic automotive casualty count. Could there even be this many police cars in Sofia?Its perhaps worth noting here that although the movie is set in Bulgaria there is virtually no Bulgarian spoken throughout the film (though in a moment of frustration The Voice does allow himself a German ""Scheisse""). Moreover in an obvious effort to retain Gomezs PG-13 audience the F-word is conspicuous in its absence. Getaway is almost certainly the first theoretically hard-boiled film to make such copious incongruous use of the verb ""screw"" (""Now Im screwed too"" ""Screw you"" ""Youre screwed"" etc.). The resulting impression is a microcosm of Gomezs performance and of the film as a whole a kid trying desperately to act like a grownup but with no real idea what that might entail.Go away Getaway.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

At the end of 2013 in the low-slung industrial Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung a bevy of officials came to attend the ribbon cutting of a huge former hotel that had undergone a top-to-bottom multimillion-dollar renovation. Speaking before the throngs of celebrants who blocked the flow of traffic Taiwans deputy director of the Ministry of the Interior praised the group that funded the renovation and presented them for the 10th year straight with the national ""Excellent Religious Group"" award. ""For years you have dedicated your time and lives to anti-drug work and human- rights dissemination"" said the director echoing praise offered by the mayors office and the presidents national-policy adviser.

Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Mark Kauzlarich / Reuters How Chelsea Beat Ivanka at Being a Candidate Daughter Michelle Cottle The comparatively less flashy less spirited former First Kid managed to show her moms softer side at the DNC on Thursday. Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters The Most Inspiring and Depressing Moment of the Democratic Convention Uri Friedman The father of a Muslim American who died in Iraq confronts Donald Trump. Khizr Khan began his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday with words I wish he didnt have to say ""Tonight we are honored to stand here as parents of Captain Humayun Khan and as patriotic American Muslims--as patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country."" I wish he and his wife didnt have to stand there as the parents of a 27-year-old Army captain who was killed by suicide bombers while serving in the Iraq War. And I wish Khizr Khan hadnt felt the need to declare his patriotism and loyalty to the United States of America. Those truths should have been self-evident. The state of the union is not strong when an American feels compelled to clarify such things. In better times Khizr Khan who was born in Pakistan and moved to America from the United Arab Emirates might have begun his speech with what he said next ""Like many immigrants we came to this country empty-handed. We believed in American democracy--that with hard work and [the] goodness of this country we could share in and contribute to its blessings."" Continue Reading Channel 4 The Prescience of Brass Eye 15 Years Later David Sims Chris Morriss brutal satire aired its last and most controversial episode in 2001 but its skewering of the news media feels more relevant than ever. A sex offender is thrown in the stocks presented with a small child and asked if he wants to molest him. A mob of protestors is thrown a ""dummy full of guts"" that is stomped to pieces within seconds. A radio host insists that pedophiles have ""more genes in common with crabs"" than the rest of humanity insisting ""Theres no real evidence for [that] but it is scientific fact."" Its hard to pinpoint the most cringe-inducing moment on ""Paedogeddon"" a special episode of the British TV satire Brass Eye. But 15 years after the episode aired it remains a totemic terrifying satirical vision. Few comedies since have dared to cross the boundaries of taste with such impunity. ""Paedogeddon"" aired in the U.K. in the summer of 2001 a year after the murder of a young girl had sparked national hysteria over the countrys sex-offender registry. Britains most-read newspaper led a campaign to publish the names and locations of all 110000 convicted sex offenders prompting a riot in which an angry mob ransacked the home of an ex-con. Brass Eye a parody of a 60 Minutes-like newsmagazine show had been dormant after airing one season in the UK in 1997. But it returned four years later for this surprise broadcast one that saw its furious (fictional) anchors barking from a dark studio about the plague of seemingly super-powered child molesters stalking the nation holding a funhouse mirror up to the climate of paranoia and fear that had built up around the country. It was a bold wildly insensitive piece of comedy but one that captured the growing madness of the 24-hour news media and foreshadowed some uglier aspects of its future. Continue Reading Charles Mostoller / Reuters Can Personality Be Changed? Scott Barry Kaufman Psychologists have long debated how flexible someones ""true"" self is. Almost everyone has something they want to change about their personality. In 2014 a study that traced peoples goals for personality change found that the vast majority of its subjects wanted to be more extraverted agreeable emotionally stable and open to new experiences. A whopping 97 percent said they wished they were more conscientious. These desires appeared to be rooted in dissatisfaction. People wanted to become more extraverted if they werent happy with their sex lives hobbies or friendships. They wanted to become more conscientious if they were displeased with their finances or schoolwork. The findings reflect the social psychologist Roy Baumeisters notion of ""crystallization of discontent"" Once people begin to recognize larger patterns of shortcomings in their lives he contends they may reshuffle their core values and priorities to justify improving things.

Posted September 4 2013 -- 1200 AM EDT If you go into the vehicular thriller Getaway with your expectations reasonably lowered knowing that not all movies need air-tight plots or deep characters and understanding that splashy car crashes can be their own excuse for mindless fun -- you will still be astonished by how flat-out awful it is. A B-movie made out of F-grade parts Getaway has some of the trappings of a charmingly crass go-for-broke action pic like the delightful Crank. But its too dumb -- and far too cynical about what audiences want -- to even know how to have fun with them. When his wife is held hostage a former race car driver (Ethan Hawke) is told that his only chance for saving her is to get into a souped-up muscle car and follow the pointless youve-gotta-be-kidding-me orders barked at him over the phone by a criminal mastermind (Jon Voight doing a misguided Werner Herzog impression). ""Crash into everything you can"" ""Drive onto the skating rink"" ""Crash into the water truck"" Its exactly what a 12-year-old might yell to a friend playing a video game but the movie carries out its action with a straight-faced pseudo-intensity that starts your eyes rolling as fast as the cars wheels. Even worse Getaway operates in a humor-free zone where were never encouraged to belly laugh at the ridiculousness of say a hotrod speeding through a crowded European plaza without a single visible casualty. (For reasons known only to the filmmakers -- and probably their accountants -- this all takes place in Sofia Bulgaria.) Things only get less plausible from there when the cars real owner a teenage-looking hoodlum (Selena Gomez) tries to get her wheels back and ends up being dragged along for the ride. Of course it turns out shes a fellow American expat with a SoCal drawl. (Sure why not?) And a genius-level computer whiz. (If you say so) Who can perform advanced feats of instantaneous hacking with her iPad. (Kids these days right?) All without breaking a sweat or smudging her thick slick of lip gloss. And throughout it all theres poor Ethan Hawke his face sunken into a credible action-hero scowl that sometimes adds a faint sad glimmer of authenticity to the Hot Wheels derby going on around him. Which only makes it worse when you catch him occasionally looking like hes fully aware that his movie -- like the car that hes zooming around in -- is going nowhere fast.

How sad that Ethan Hawke who should know better agreed to star in this belching exhaust pipe of nonstop toxicity. Hawke plays Brent Magra a former NASCAR driver racing a Shelby Mustang through the pedestrian-clogged streets of Bulgaria. Why? Because Jon Voight playing a voice on the phone insisted. Why? Because the voice needs something and has kidnapped the drivers wife to make sure he gets it. So there goes Brent careening through Sofia park at Christmas time as shoppers dive for cover and police cars prove helpless to catch up. Then Selena Gomez looking like a Munchkin in a hoodie tries to steal the car at gunpoint. Why? Because the dumbass script told her to. Why does she keep calling Brent and everyone else in the movie an asshole? Because shes right. For 89 minutes that feel like 89 hours cars speed out of control and crash doing only PG-13 damage. The damage to your brain while watching it is incalculable. And so the movie summer of 2013 ends this Labor Day weekend with a wipeout.

Geoff Pevere Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 30 2013 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Aug. 30 2013 1033AM EDT Comments AA Directed by Courtney Solomon Written by Sean Finegan Gregg Maxwell Parker Starring Ethan Hawke Selena Gomez Jon Voight Genre action Country USA Language English One of those newfangled car-chase movies in which ""chase"" describes not just a scene or two but the whole damned thing Getaway is both preposterous and pure. Its a CGI-free demolition derby in which Ethan Hawke and Selena Gomez trash the lovely Bulgarian city of Sofia with nothing but clenched jaws multiple digi-cams a 2008 Shelby Super Snake Mustang and the skimpiest of plot lines. Some might wonder why the filmmakers took this foot-to-the-floor approach but then theyre probably not the types who buy tickets to see Getaway. Such questions are irrelevant and inappropriate - you dont ask a gamer why everyones in such a rush in Grand Theft Auto. Just shut up and drive dude.In a movie that during production trashed 130 vehicles required some 6000 editing cuts and never once stooped to computer-generated trickery the story goes like this After his wife is kidnapped by anonymous baldies in leather jackets a disgraced former Nascar jockey Brent Magna (Ethan Hawke) must pilot his souped-up muscle car at the whim of a man we never see. But he can see Magna and his reluctant co-pilot a conveniently tech-savvy teen (Selena Gomez) and he directs the mayhem with cool cruelty. In due time the cocky computer-geek teenager cottons to the bad guys master plan - its got something to do with I kid you not robbing the bank her poppa happens to run - but not until weve been through a string of crashes hairpins and rubber-burning near-misses.Toronto-born director Courtney Solomon has shot the movie mostly on high-definition video and this combined with the use of mini-cams placed in on and around the Shelby and all over Sofia gives Getaway an on-the-fly urgency and immediacy which is exactly whats called for under the circumstances. Everything in this movie depends on pure automotive momentum and on our captivation by it lest even a moments pause leaves time for viewers to consider that the whole thing is pretty ridiculous.The problem with momentum however is that it begins to create its own form of stasis By the time the movie actually arrives at its finest moment - a nearly two-minute single shot from the Mustangs hood as it chases the villains van through dense traffic - youve become so numb to speed and sensation that you may barely notice.That said the long unblinking shot is a terrific feat of unmanipulated low-tech sensation and it makes you wonder why the technique wasnt used earlier and more often - its appearance so near the end of the movie makes the rest of the ride feel more pointlessly overwrought. And perhaps it works so well precisely because its so sparingly used. But the thrill of control amid mayhem gives this extended point-of-view shot its power and its a pity the rest of Getaway is in too much of a rush to learn that lesson.

Picture Warner Bros. Image 8 of 8 Getaway review Bad script worse editing 1 / 8 Back to Gallery Getaway Action thriller. Starring Ethan Hawke Selena Gomez and Jon Voight. Directed by Courtney Solomon. (PG-13. 90 minutes.) Youve probably seen this movie before watching a child play with his toy Hot Wheels cars after eating multiple bowls of sugary breakfast cereal. Theres not much dialogue or continuity or logic in ""Getaway."" Just a lot of speeding loud driving noises smashing of police roadblocks and cars rear-ending other cars before flipping two or three times in the air. Plot is secondary - maybe tertiary - in this forgettable low-budget action movie wedged between the summer movie season and the gets-earlier-every-year fall and winter Oscar movie push. Director Courtney Solomon aims for a lightweight car-chase film but any guilty pleasure potential is ruined by a pestilence of quick edits close-ups blurring and other action-film-making shortcuts. Equally egregious is the films almost complete lack of fun. Just this summer Ethan Hawke showed hes capable of embracing the ridiculous with a wink and a nod in ""The Purge."" Behind the wheel in this film the actor is frustratingly deadpan. He seems to constantly have one eye on the road while the other looks for a bank so he can cash his ""Getaway"" check. Hawke is Brent a disgraced pro race car driver whose wife has been kidnapped by a mysterious man (Jon Voight workshopping a vague Eastern European accent). Brent must complete a series of increasingly dangerous tasks - too many involving driving into crowds of scurrying pedestrians - if he wants to see his beloved again. Selena Gomez shows up as the Kid the precocious owner of Brents stolen ride. Pursuant to the ""WarGames"" Act of 1983 she is an expert hacker has had a rift with her parents and happens to carry around every computer tool necessary to further the films rickety narrative. The real star though is a silver Shelby Mustang Super Snake armored and apparently rigged by Elon Musk himself to get 400 miles to the gallon. With the beating Brent inflicts on the car the Mustang would need 12 tires 17 clutches and at least 147 gallons of gas to reach the films finale. The vehicle is a work of automotive art but most of the chase scenes are muddled with repeated edits of a second or less. It starts to feel like watching a movie with a strobe light. The above process has been used by good filmmakers in good movies. (From the fast edits of the ""Bourne"" films to the muddy battles of ""Elysium"" weve never actually seen Matt Damon fight.) But rarely in these high doses - easily half of the movie is a car chase. One can only hope ""Getaway"" film editor Ryan Dufrene negotiated to be paid by the cut. ""Getaway"" takes place in Bulgaria which has to be the second least interesting European country in which to set a movie. (Sorry Poland.) Perhaps the country was picked for its lack of helicopters and police radios neither of which seems to be utilized in the police departments bumbling pursuit of Brent. The final act does include a few welcome twists. And after an entire movie of darkness the break of dawn is so welcome you might weep. But then more car chases. Youll find yourself yearning for the coherence of a ""Dukes of Hazzard"" pursuit. At least the General Lee sometimes stopped for gas.

That sort of ludicrous premise should be ripe for outrageous B-movie thrills. Unfortunately this genre cheapie--no relation to the Jim Thompson novel of a similar name or its 1972 Steve McQueen-Sam Peckinpah adaptation--is despite a constant focus on auto mayhem a lumbering dud incapable of getting out of first gear. Civilians are put in harms way. Fireballs are escaped. Beaucoup cop cruisers are flipped. Yet director Courtney Solomon pours on the surveillance-cam POVs and edits his set pieces so manically that reckless thrills are sabotaged. Thats a near-fatal flaw as Getaway cares little about plot and even less about credibility (cue a pouty-mouthed Gomez spouting nuggets of wisdom about computer servers and ISPs).

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com Getaway Share Comment There are movies that get trashed rightly for playing like one long chase sequence. And then there are those that just as rightly wear their continuous need for speed as a badge - movies like well ""Speed"" or ""Cellular."" The relentlessly paced ""Getaway"" with Ethan Hawke and Selena Gomez ambitiously shoots to be one of the good ones. But in the end its hard to remember another action entry that expends so much energy on frenetic blacktop choreography and attention-deficit editing with so little to show for it. Hawke plays Brent Magna a washed-up race car driver who discovers his wife (Rebecca Budig) has been kidnapped then gets a call from a mystery strings-puller (Jon Voight) ordering him to steal a Ford Shelby and get moving.

"Getaway - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Getaway Posted by Christy Lemire on August 29 2013 1 Comment Warner Bros. Pictures Rated PG-13 for intense action violence and mayhem throughout some rude gestures and language. Running time 90 minutes. One and a half stars out of four. The Summer of Ethan Hawke ends in batshit-crazy fashion with ""Getaway"" an over-the-top car chase movie that drives all night but never really goes anywhere. Following the emotional honesty of ""Before Midnight"" and the lurid thrills of ""The Purge"" Hawkes latest is a piece of noisy Euro B-movie trash. Thats called range baby. ""Getaway"" might have been enjoyable as a mindless bit of dumb late-summer entertainment if it had been vaguely coherent. The mere fact that Hawkes character is named Brent Magna would seem to bode well. Instead its an overly edited mish-mosh from a million different camera angles -- scattered manic unfocused -- which makes it not only difficult to tell whats happening quite often but also difficult to care. Does director Courtney Solomon really think were incapable of looking at a single image for more than a few seconds at a time? Rather than upping the intensity this Cuisinart-style editing approach actually achieves the opposite effect Its numbing and distancing. The only enjoyment to be found in ""Getaway"" is from laughing at the ridiculousness of its premise and the stilted banter that so frequently constitutes its dialogue. Brent comes home to his apartment in Sofia Bulgaria -- why he and Selena Gomezs character live there is explained eventually -- to find that his wife has been kidnapped. Adding insult to injury the bad guys snatched her while she was decorating the Christmas tree listening to carols and enjoying a glass of red wine. Is nothing sacred? Brent receives orders from a disembodied but obviously menacing voice (Jon Voight credited as The Voice appropriately enough) to go to a specific parking garage and steal a specific car a custom Ford Shelby GT500 Super Snake. Turns out Brent is a washed-up racecar driver; in theory he should know what to do with this muscular machine. What hes asked to do with it however is ludicrous The Voice gives him a series of impossible tasks that could result in massive destruction and carnage. If he fails to accomplish them his wife will die. And The Voice knows whether Brent is following through because hes watching his every move and listening to his every word through the cameras and microphones that have been placed both inside and outside the car. As if that werent bad enough Brent also must contend with the saucy whiny teenage girl who jumps into the passenger seat and puts a gun to his head. Shes played by Gomez in a hoodie and a sneer; any leaps she made from her squeaky-clean Disney Channel image toward more challenging mature material with ""Spring Breakers"" might have been obliterated entirely here. Then again the script from Sean Finnegan and Gregg Maxwell Parker doesnt think much of her character naming her only The Kid and saddling her with laughable techno jargon to spout. Turns out the car belongs to The Kid. But not only is she a serious gearhead shes also a brilliant computer expert. She can simply hack into the citys police server with some video she shoots on her phone and a few taps on the tablet she keeps in the glove compartment. (The people who stole the car and tricked it out with all that gadgetry didnt think to look there?) Gomezs presence constitutes the most implausible casting choice youll see all year and it smacks of a cynical attempt to make ""Getaway"" appeal to young audiences. Now the two of them are stuck in the car together -- you see the wife dies if The Kid bails too -- carrying out these increasingly dangerous and deadly tasks. They talk openly in their efforts to outsmart the films villain which seems silly and counterproductive given that he can hear everything theyre saying. As they drive all night wreaking havoc in their wake is an untold number of police cars that get tangled and mangled trying to track them down. Much has been made of the fact that these are actual cars being crashed and not just the result of CGI blippery. Truly there should be some sort of counter in the bottom corner of the screen to allow us to keep track of the destruction. But given the way these chases and collisions are shot and edited any efforts to achieve authenticity are wasted. Hawke remains weathered and weary throughout; driving and driven he doesnt get much to work with beyond a singular note of desperation. And once Brent finds out exactly why he of all people was chosen for this elaborate escapade its a wonder he doesnt cry out in incredulous wonder -- just as audiences will when its time for the big reveal.

"Review Getaway is one big wreck - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Getaway is one big wreck Getaway Warner Bros. Selena Gomez as the Kid and Ethan Hawke as Brent Magna in ""Getaway."" Selena Gomez as the Kid and Ethan Hawke as Brent Magna in ""Getaway."" (Warner Bros.) Sheri Linden When a production benefits the Bulgarian economy as much as ""Getaway"" apparently did it might seem mean-spirited to knock it. And when its wall-to-wall car stunts are the real metal-on-metal deal shot in the streets of the capital city thats worth noting. But unless youre a demolition-derby fetishist or a connoisseur of vehicular mayhem none of that will buy you a thrill in this video game posing as a movie a preposterously plotted kidnapping story starring a high-performance Mustang.Behind the wheel of that tricked-out automobile is a weary Ethan Hawke as a onetime race-car driver named Brent Magna. Riding shotgun with him is Selena Gomez playing another American living in Sofia a rich brat whom the screenplay refers to as ""the Kid"" as though to imbue her with toughness. The machinations that place them together are best left unexplained -- not because of potential spoilers but because the particulars would only induce a low-grade headache.PHOTOS Hollywood backlot moments Magnas considerable headache begins when his wife (Rebecca Budig) is kidnapped her safety dependent on whether he can steal an exceptionally pricey car follow orders to drive like a lunatic bent on destruction and evade arrest. Dormant skills return in a flash as he puts the machine in gear and floors it.The customized Shelby Super Snake is rigged with cameras facing inside and out -- a detail that amps the points of view available to director Courtney Solomon but doesnt make the action any more involving for the viewer.Like a contestant in an exceptionally cruel reality show Magna must pull off a series of ostentatious ""tasks"" amid a crowded Christmas-season city. He gets his instructions from the anonymous architect of the scheme via dashboard technology a malevolent GPS ""The water truck -- smash into it.""The voice is supplied by Jon Voight (no stranger to transportation chaos having manned a ""Runaway Train"" in the 80s); he affects Mitteleuropean inflections that suggest a tranquilized Werner Herzog. FULL COVERAGE Movie Sneaks 2013While Magna dutifully-reluctantly mows through flocks of pedestrians the Kid who just happens to be a tech whiz stops complaining long enough to hack into servers using her iPad. If theres any lesson to be derived from ""Getaway"" its that computer tablets come in handy when youre in the clutches of a tech-savvy evil mastermind.On the evidence of this and his previous film ""An American Haunting"" Solomon places visual effects head and shoulders above characterization. Deploying an ace stunt team led by Charlie Picerni he plunges straight into the action and doesnt let up. The ludicrous pileup of crushed chassis mostly from cop cars sent colliding flying rolling and burning grows quickly numbing.The human element -- Hawkes efforts notwithstanding -- amounts to an afterthought. Grafted-on ideas about redemption and loyalty are hokum; the only true object of love and admiration here is that Shelby.Gomez occupies a register consisting of one note and its not a convincing one. Hawke has considerably more range although when worry crosses his face you suspect hes thinking about the script. And who could blame him published writer that he is? If the banter in ""Getaway"" had some edge or dazzle or humor the destructo-overkill might be bearable. But the wan excuse for verbal sparring in the screenplay by first-timers Sean Finegan and Gregg Maxwell Parker has all the gleam and precision of a rusty butter knife.A few Sofia locations are well used but the inky nighttime palette keeps most of the sliced-and-diced action in an undifferentiated murk. Arriving as too little too late is an atypical continuous shot racing out of the city at dawn -- an inkling of a better movie and the road not taken.calendarlatimes.com---------------------------GetawayMPAA rating PG-13 for intense action violence and mayhem throughout some rude gestures and languageRunning time 1 hour 29 minutesPlaying In wide release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Getaway Ethan Hawke Networking Selena Gomez Rebecca Budig Selena Gomez Career highlights On the Set Movies and TV Movie review Closed Circuit cranks up paranoia over Big Brother Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad71deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-getaway-20130830,0,3711469.story",200,getaway(2013)16,getaway(2013),latimes

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Former racecar driver Brett Magna (Ethan Hawke) and his unnamed sidekick (Selena Gomez) ride around aimlessly while an unseen villain leads them on in ""Getaway."" (Simon Varsano) By Stephanie Merry August 29 2013 Follow stephmerry ""Getaway"" could have been an excellent two-minute film. As the action movie rattles toward its conclusion there is one car chase filmed so expertly -- the viewpoint from the front bumper of the trailing car -- that it evokes ""Bullitt""-level revelations about how a high-speed pursuit should be shot. How is it possible that such a spectacle got shoehorned into a movie with no other redeeming qualities? The remaining 80-odd minutes seem to be a mere excuse to showcase one lonely instance of impressive directing. The story such as it is follows Brent Magna (Ethan Hawke). The onetime racecar driver comes home to his Bulgarian apartment to find the Christmas tree toppled and a pool of blood on the floor. Before he can wonder what happened he receives a call from a vaguely Eastern European-sounding fellow who demands that Brent steal a particular car and complete a few strange tasks or hell never see his wife again. Off Brent goes hopping into a silver Shelby Super Snake (basically a souped-up Mustang) and periodically answering calls from the madman then following such orders as Drive into a park smash through an outdoor holiday market and skid across an ice skating rink. Brent checks off his to-do list all the while evading police who are understandably concerned with apprehending the maniac who has been off- roading all over Sofia. At some point a girl (Selena Gomez) jumps into the car claiming the stolen ride is hers. The evil puppetmaster who has cameras trained on driver and passenger insists Brent drag her along on his escapades. Shes not happy and most of the dialogue consists of her repeating ""I hate you"" and ""Youre a terrible driver."" But wouldnt you know she quickly transforms into a caring accomplice who has a few high-tech tricks up her sleeve. As the story hightails it into outlandishness so do the chase scenes. Brent manages to take out what seems like every police car in Bulgaria. The siren-topped automobiles collide log roll or flip over and at one point two cop cars snap up onto their rear bumpers and appear to high-five. But its nothing to celebrate. As a whole the action sequences either look fake or are intercut with so many other images that any excitement dissolves. The shot list might look something like this police cars closing in on Brents car; Brents tattooed hand shifting gears; close-up of the dashboard; tight shot of the toothpick clenched in Brents teeth. It becomes impossible to comprehend the full scope of danger. And besides when did Brent have time to find a toothpick? The scenes of dialogue are edited in the same distracting way. Rather than hold a wide shot to capture both Brent and the girl sitting side-by-side the camera too often flips back and forth inciting a tiresome visual whiplash. Meanwhile the music sounds like it was snatched from an action parody. If only the movie didnt take itself so seriously maybe thats what it could be. Instead were stuck with a couple of gloomy characters doing battle with a villain whose face -- ""Inspector Gadget"" style -- almost never makes it onscreen. (He is played by the voice mouth and stubble of Jon Voight.) By the time the big reveal comes airing the evildoers preposterous motives a viewer might have forgotten his intentions were even still under wraps. The whole movie becomes such a pileup of detritus whether its cop cars or plot points that even something as important as rationale becomes an afterthought. 1/2 star PG-13. At area theaters. Contains language a rude gesture countless car crashes action and mostly bloodless violence. 90 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Photo Warner Bros. Picture ""Getaway"" is so bad that whats most surprising about it is that Nicolas Cage didnt manage to star in it. But one man can only do so many low-rent projects a year. Instead its Ethan Hawke who (for some reason) is in Sofia Bulgaria where his wife is kidnapped while decorating the Christmas tree. A mysterious off-screen supervillain (voiced by Jon Voight doing a German accent) instructs Hawke who we learn is a retired pro race-car driver named Brent to steal a hot Mustang. Then with The Voice giving nutty instructions over the car speakers and watching on video monitors Brent must go tearing around Sofia smashing into things evading police and perhaps killing innocents along the way. At one stop he gets a gun pointed at him by a teenage girl (Selena Gomez) who tells him hes driving her ride -- a Shelby GT500 Super Snake. Needless to say the car does the best acting in the movie and as for dialogue Ill take the Shelbys purring and vrooming over anything the humans come up with. About 19/20ths of the way through there is a smooth extended take filmed from the dashboard of the car as it muscles its way through traffic. Its momentarily hypnotic. The shot is reminiscent of ""CEtait Un Rendez-Vous"" the breathless single-take 1976 film by Claude Lelouch about a hell-bent extremely illegal eight-minute drive through Paris at dawn. It stands as one of the greatest hot-rod movies ever made (and saves you 82 minutes of filler compared to ""Getaway""). Ethan Hawke stars in a wipeout of a car-chase movie in ""Getaway."" (Warner Bros. Picture) If all of ""Getaway"" were as smooth and seductive as that single late scene Id have no complaints about the ridiculously contrived plot or the uselessness of Gomez who is such a doll-like figure that its as if Minnie Mouse were sitting next to Hawke spewing obscenities supplying exposition and flipping off the bad guys. (We get it Selena After this and ""Spring Breakers"" youre no longer a Disney kid. So what?) But even as a thin excuse for a series of car chases ""Getaway"" -- which isnt actually about a getaway but hopes to make you think of the unrelated 1972 Steve McQueen chase film ""The Getaway"" -- wipes out. As directed by Courtney Solomon (""An American Haunting"") the chases are a meaningless salad of imagery the editing so fast and furious that you never have the time to figure out where objects are in relation to one another. And after a few minutes of hurtle and whoosh you start to think Solomon doesnt know either and is whipping everything together in a Cuisinart of confusion in an effort to fool you into thinking that something exciting is going on. Instead youll quickly realize that the only rule in the chase scenes is that everyone but Hawke and his passenger will go splat. I lost track of how many times police cars and motorcycles would zip up alongside the Shelby only to get smooshed up against walls slammed into pillars or sent tumbling off into the night sky. Meanwhile in the car the Gomez kid (the script doesnt even bother to give her a name -- edgy) manages effortlessly to outwit the supervillain who has cameras hooked up all over the car as he instructs Brent to for instance pointlessly hurtle though a Christmas market and attendant crowds of pedestrians in a park. The kid simply hooks up an iPad punches a couple of buttons and bam She has overridden all of the cars surveillance systems and replaced the video monitoring feed with an endlessly repeating three-second loop of her and Brent sitting obediently when actually theyre foiling all the evil plans. Never mind that no one is going to be fooled by a three-second video loop for more than six seconds. Ordered to shoot his passenger Brent refuses. So the bad guy does . . . nothing. (In fact he even praises Brent for making the right call.) At another point surrounded by cops with pistols drawn Brent starts waving a gun in the air. In my reading of police behavior this is generally considered an invitation to pump off about 500 rounds in the general direction of the suspects head but instead Bulgarias Finest simply back off and let Brent escape. Cmon guys this perp is responsible for the deaths of maybe dozens of your brothers in uniform. At least give him a noogie or something to let him know hes been naughty.

To get her back he must follow the commands of a mysterious caller who tells him when and where to drive. Getaway also stars Selena Gomez. VPC Scott Bowles USA TODAY 6 p.m. EDT August 29 2013Despite non-stop action ""Getaway"" cant muster a script or character leaving it a sputtering dead-end.Getaway with Selena Gomez and Ethan Hawke wastes a decent cast.(Photo Warner Bros.)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review  out of fourStars Ethan Hawke Selena Gomez Jon VoightRated PG-13; Runtime 1 hour 30 minutes; Opens Friday nationwide 6 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMOREAside from perhaps Nicolas Cage Ethan Hawke has the oddest resume in film.In his 42 years Hawke has nabbed an Oscar nomination for Training Day anchored the charming Before Sunrise trilogy and done a creepy sci-fi turn in Gattaca.Hes also starred in this summers two worst films Junes The Purge and now Getaway ( out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide) a car-chase clunker that cant escape its own noxious emissions.Hawke plays Brent Magna (really) a former pro race car driver who in the first 30 seconds of the film discovers his wife has been kidnapped by a mastermind who threatens to kill her if he doesnt go on a crime spree that includes stealing a car robbing a bank and trying to run over kids in a skating rink (really).VIDEO Voight talks Getaway Ray Donovan and JolieREVIEWS The latest reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersAs far as a set-up thats as much as youll get from this 90-minute migraine that wants to cross-pollinate Fast amp; Furious with Taken. Instead it manages to be just a shadow of both Its fast though no character is developed enough to exhibit an emotion like fury; and people will get taken -- audiences who open their wallets.While Getaway smashes as many cars as a state fair demolition derby it has less plot. Instead its more of an ad for a souped-up Mustang Shelby which Hawke drives wide-eyed while an anonymous fiend (Jon Voight) watches him from remote cameras in the car like a GPS from hell ordering Magna to smash fruit trucks and Santas village (really).Halfway through we meet ""The Kid"" (Selena Gomez) a pistol-toting computer whiz who owns said Shelby and gets caught up in the cat-and-mouse chase through the streets of Sofia Bulgaria. Just so happens she brought her iPad to turn the tables on her tormentor. Apparently theres an app for that.While Gomez shows glimpses of acting chops shes overwhelmed by director Courtney Solomons clunky dialogue leaving her to bray helpful hostage hints like ""Go faster"" ""Lose him"" and ""Gimme that gun""Its hard to know where to start with a movie like Getaway whose sole purpose seems to be to hop aboard the Furious box office bandwagon. But compared to this lemon Furious is a Scorsese franchise.The true wonder of Getaway is how it managed to lure recognizable stars including an Oscar nominee an Academy Award winner in Voight (or his lower lip which gets most of the screen time) and a tweener sensation in Gomez. The film makes a strong case that the stars were good friends with a producer; in need of fast cash; or on the cusp of firing an agent.Whatever the reason moviegoers will benefit from heeding this titles advice to get away. Say this for Hawke He has a knack for films the public wants to see. And he may be right here. But Getaway is one of his careers odder detours. 6 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/18mt2uE",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/08/29/getaway-movie-review/2610783/,200,getaway(2013)19,getaway(2013),usatoday

In Courtney Solomons Getaway a project less effective as a feature film than as a promotional reel for the Shelby Super Snake -- basically an insanely tricked-out Ford Mustang -- the nonsense piles up nearly as fast as the smashed flipped T-boned and otherwise trashed cop cars chasing after Ethan Hawkes laughably named Brent Magna and his sidekick ""The Kid."" (No really. ""The Kid."") (She is a teen hacker. Played by Selena Gomez. May we remind you that its August?) This is a movie for those who watched Liam Neeson in Taken and thought ""Hey this is fun but can we do it without having to wait 15 minutes for the action to start?"" Solomon has 90 minutes at his disposal and doesnt want to waste time with setup. So he crosscuts flashback shots of Magna discovering his apartment ransacked and his wife gone with practically eroticized shots of the car hell spend most of the next hour and a half in. (Its frankly shocking that Shelby doesnt already have the films showroom shot of the cars fierce grille ornament running on a loop on their website.) That engine starts revving and tires start burning within the first two minutes of the film and they barely stop for the rest of it as Magna is directed around the streets of Sofia (we are for complicated reasons in Bulgaria) by the German-accented voice of the man who has kidnapped his wife and will kill her unless he helps ... do something. What exactly remains vague. A movie like Getaway really only has one deceptively simple job to punch viewers repeatedly in the adrenal gland for a little while and leave them feeling like theyve been in the chase themselves. Its obvious Solomon knows his reference points the Christmas setting the German villain with motives obscured by a little bait and switch the spouse in peril -- they all scream Die Hard while the near-constant fast-car action the odd-couple bickering between male and female leads the villain giving instructions from afar come from Speed. (Which itself was of course billed as Die Hard on a Bus.) What Solomon fails to recognize in those films is their essential simplicity and he unnecessarily complicates his film with too many ill-considered twists surrounding the shadowy motivations of that Teutonic voice. i Ethan Hawke headlines the picture along with Selena Gomez but its still pretty much a movie about a car. Which for some reason is largely bulletproof. Simon Versano/Warner Bros. Pictures hide caption toggle caption Simon Versano/Warner Bros. Pictures Ethan Hawke headlines the picture along with Selena Gomez but its still pretty much a movie about a car. Which for some reason is largely bulletproof. Simon Versano/Warner Bros. Pictures He also complicates things with the ridiculously implausible character he gives Gomez to play a plot-hole panacea meant to lead the script out of whatever corner it has gotten itself into at any given time. Shes a spoiled rich kid a muscle-car gearhead a supergenius hacker who can tap into any network in 30 seconds on an iPad and a brilliant tactician to boot. Turns out that car -- which Magna is ordered to steal at the very start of the movie the better to carry out The Voices plan -- belongs to her as well. Why a 20-year-old trust-fund brat needs not just a fast car but an armored virtually indestructible fast car is a mystery solved only when you consider that its required by the plot. Thats just one of the questions you cant help but ask while watching the film unless you can reduce your neurological functioning to brainstem only. All that aside Getaway might still eke out a pass if the car chases could earn one on their own. But the best hot-pursuit flicks thrive by speeding just on the edge of plausibility. The chases in The French Connection and Bullitt say work because the directors of those films thought about just how much disbelief we in the audience might be willing to suspend. Solomon demonstrates no such consideration here; the chase sequences despite the immediacy created by the onboard POV cameras used to film them start with cartoonish as their baseline and grow more outlandish from there. At one point after the success of a particularly ridiculous tactic Hawke utters the movies definitive line ""I cant believe that worked."" Yeah we cant either.

"Getaway squeals wheels toward a brick wall review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesGetaway squeals wheels toward a brick wall reviewGetaway is 94 gruelling minutes of car chases explosions and grimaces. What was Ethan Hawke thinking?Selena Gomez as The Kid and Ethan Hawke as Brent Magna in Getaway. Gomez exhibits the acting range of a hubcap and Hawke grimaces like hes passing a kidney stone says Peter Howell.  (Warner Bros. Pictures photo)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Aug. 29 2013GetawayStarring Ethan Hawke and Selena Gomez. Directed by Courtney Solomon. At major theatres. 94 minutes. PGGetaway is 94 gruelling minutes of car chases explosions and grimaces.The latter are amply supplied by Ethan Hawke. He looks as if hes either passing a kidney stone or trying to decide how best to torture his agent for getting him into this hurricane of hackitude directed by Torontos Courtney Solomon (An American Haunting).Article Continued BelowHawke is Brent Magna a bummed-out ex-car racer on a desperate drive of destruction through Sofia Bulgaria to save his kidnapped wife. Hes involuntarily paired with The Kid played by pop diva Selena Gomez Magnas passenger and scold in a tricked-out speedster.Theyre both under the eye ear and thumb of an unseen psycho linked by video and voiced by Jon Voight who adopts the accent of a bad Bond villain. Drive recklessly and smash stuff up he tells Magna or say farewell to your wife (Rebecca Budig). Couldnt the psycho just buy a ticket to a Battle of the Monster Trucks show?All this is happening during Christmas and theres only one reason for a Yuletide movie opening in August its a lump of coal for our stocking.Gomez was OK as part of the Spring Breakers ensemble of bad girls earlier this year but in this co-lead role she exhibits the acting range of a hubcap. Good thing she still has her pop career to fall back on.Voight has long ceased being a serious actor. Hes in it now for the laughs and the cash although Getaway isnt likely to generate much of either.As for Hawke we had reason to expect better of him. Hes a fine actor who has had a great year so far winning critical kudos for Before Midnight and doing major bank with The Purge a solid ""B"" home-invasion thriller that did ""A"" box office.Hawke shouldnt have to do crap like Getaway anymore. Maybe when he read the ludicrous script by Sean Finegan and Gregg Maxwell Parker which could have been scribbled onto a napkin Hawke thought he was getting into a film like Taken which this barely resembles.But Taken had a sympathetic lead in Liam Neeson and also forward momentum both of which Getaway sorely lacks. The movie goes everywhere and nowhere visually incoherent even by the low standards of modern action films. No amount of editing-room triage could have saved it.In a weird way Getaway is almost a tribute to Hawke. A movie this bad would normally go straight to video or to landfill. The studio obviously figured Hawkes star power is bright enough that he can shake some late-summer coin out of unsuspecting moviegoers.This may be too generous a thought. The only real benefit of Getaway is pointing out the likely winners of the next Razzie Award for Worst Screen Couple. Come on down Hawke and Gomez you certainly deserve it.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Grade D- This nonstop chase film could make a critic feel guilty for calling other movies ""empty."" ""Getaway"" creates a vacuum that sucks the life right out of you. Its set in Sofia Bulgaria but theres no novelty or exotic flavor because theres no atmosphere whatsoever. In the frenzied setup thugs kidnap the wife of former racecar driver Brent Magna (Ethan Hawke). In order to get her back Brent must take the wheel of a 2008 Mustang Shelby GT 500 Super Snake and follow hazardous directions phoned into the car by a fat-cat criminal with stomach-turning stubble. (90 per cent of the time mouth cheeks and chin are all we see of him.) Brent soon gets saddled with the cars true owner (Selena Gomez) the petulant computer-savvy daughter of a bank president. As Brent guiltily plows through crowds or police pileups Hawke provides a bit of emotional ballast. Gomez is alternately annoying and banal. Any good kinetic trip movie has to be an exercise in style. Except for one cleverly sustained point-of-view shot near the end ""Getaway"" is merely an exhausting mechanical demonstration. It calls for stat sheets not reviews. Director Courtney Solomon gathered a fleet of 130 vehicles and rigged most of them with tiny cameras that he also placed in the middle of streets for ""drive-over shots."" He foreswore CGI for actual crashes but then edited the film so manically and tightly that you cant appreciate the stunts. He forces you to follow over 6000 cuts. Solomons film puts you in the same degrading position as Brent when the muckety-muck barks orders at him. Its as if the director is pulling you by the nose. You feel like yelling ""Knock it off.""

Special to Newsday + - Selena Gomez and Ethan Hawke in ""Getaway."" Photo Credit Simon Versano advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Cars crash. Rated PG-13 (rude gestures language) BOTTOM LINE Like ""Grand Theft Auto"" with less depth. CAST Ethan Hawke Selena Gomez LENGTH 130 Bearing no relation to the two film adaptations of Jim Thompsons novel ""The Getaway"" -- or to reality for that matter -- comes this ""Getaway"" a poorly shot-on-video crash-em-up that makes the ""Fast amp; Furious"" film series seem like ""Citizen Kane."" Not a single moment in this automotive snuff film isnt ridiculous and its only mystery is why the estimable Ethan Hawke agreed to star. The head-shaking begins almost immediately with his characters name Brent Magna. Seriously? Brent is a disgraced former race car driver now living in Sofia Bulgaria with his wife Leanne (Rebecca Budig). When shes kidnapped Brent receives phone instructions to steal a customized sports car and follow driving instructions that involve careening through pedestrian plazas crowded red-light intersections and the wrong way down one-way streets without crashing or getting caught by police. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Who was the Sons of Anarchy Homeless Woman? This he eventually learns is in service of a convoluted plot requiring him to -- get ready -- cause dozens of cars to crash in precisely the right way at precisely the right time and at precisely the right spots. For all of this to work about a thousand near-impossible things all have to happen in perfect order on a rigid timetable. Part of that involves luring the cars owner -- a rich girl (Selena Gomez looking about 12 years old) listed in the credits only as ""The Kid"" -- to where ""the police"" have told her the stolen car is having her try to steal it back at gunpoint and getting caught by Brent and forced to ride with him. The Allied High Command didnt have this many variables when planning D-Day. The movies countless car crashes do look like practical stunts and not CGI so kudos to that craftsmanship. Otherwise ""Getaway"" is repetitive reductive and stupid beyond words with all the plot and emotional resonance of a video game -- less perhaps since the police and other drivers presumably dying and getting maimed within smashed hunks of metal arent even acknowledged. Without the saving grace of satire that made ""Death Race 2000"" a cult film this is just Hot Wheels Gone Homicidal. 229 MoviesGetaway trailer PLOT Cars crash. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG-13 (rude gestures language) CAST Ethan Hawke Selena Gomez LENGTH 130 BOTTOM LINE Like ""Grand Theft Auto"" with less depth MoviesThe 25 biggest box office hits of all time Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

RELATED NEWS Hotlist 5 best Ethan Hawke films By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Aug 29 2013 952 AM The trouble with trying to grow up too fast is that you dont always make the best decisions. So if youre Selena Gomez you wind up in a movie like ""Getaway."" Maybe it looked good on paper You get to ride in a fast car driven by Ethan Hawke you get to curse a lot you even get to give someone the finger. Ooh edgy. Trouble is thats about all you get to do. Oh you get to play a kind of computer-genius hacker type but its more like ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" dropped into ""The Movie with a Much Lower IQ"" Gomez plays ... well thats one of the problems. Her character is so underdeveloped in director Courtney Solomons movie that she doesnt actually have a name. So lets start as the movie does with Hawke. He plays Brent Magna a former race-car driver who somehow washed out on the circuit. His driving skills were intact however and he went to work for whoever paid the most. ""I did some things Im not proud of"" he says as someone must in this kind of movie. He comes home to his apartment in Bulgaria to find the place ransacked and his wife (Rebecca Budig) missing. He gets a call from a man he doesnt know who tells him to steal a Shelby GT500 Super Snake tricked out with cameras inside and out. This allows the caller to watch Magna at all times. The caller then directs Magna to do various insane things (""Drive through the park"") chased by what has to be the most inept police force in the world. Along the way the cars owner (Gomez) known in the credits as ""The Kid"" winds up in the car with Magna. They have to follow the callers instructions to the letter if Magnas wife is to live. There is a plot involving banks and memory sticks and whatnot but mostly the movie is an excuse for some admittedly cool camera work (all those cameras offer more points of view) and mind-numbing chase scenes that go on and on and on. There are crashes explosions more crashes more explosions and every now and then a dash of story here a hint of plot there but nothing so involved that it interferes with the next chase. Hawke is a good actor stuck in the drivers seat of a car going really fast. Gomez the former star of the Disney Channel show ""The Wizards of Waverly Place"" and more recently a best-selling singer chose more wisely on the grown-up front with ""Spring Breakers"" Harmony Korines intriguing DayGlo teenage nightmare. But this isnt much just fast loud and empty. Maybe the title isnt a title but an instruction ""Getaway"" away from this movie and fast. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

And thats really all you need to know. A movie that gives its hero such a dorky mock-macho name isnt likely to have a lot of imagination to fuel the rest of the picture. This high-speed high-impact car chase caper is creatively running on fumes and four flat tires. It doesnt have a plot really. Its more a first draft of an outline of a notion. Brent Magnas wife is kidnapped. Brent Magna must follow the kidnappers instructions to keep Mrs. Brent Magna alive. Brent Magna is ordered to race through the city streets in a hot rod creating chaos. Brent Magna scatters many pedestrians sideswipes many police cars and careens around many corners. It reads better than it plays. ""Getaway"" is not a movie it is a list of traffic violations. In theory this material could be the basis for a stupidly awesome live-action cartoon but that would call for a stratospheric level of self-awareness and filmmaking ingenuity. This is not ""Crank"" the intentionally outrageous Jason Statham movie. This is a movie for people who view ""Crank"" and dont get the irony. ""Getaway"" takes place mostly inside a speeding car at night focusing on Hawkes grimacing face giving the action a serious lack of visual variety. The chase scenes are ugly smeary low-res messes that resemble video from a bargain-brand cellphone. Director Courtney Solomon mimics Tony Scotts cut-cut-cut style without understanding how to edit those fragments coherently. Its unclear why the film is set in Sofia Bulgaria. Perhaps its because the city has an endless supply of stupid patrol officers who think they can run a supercharged Shelby Super Snake Mustang off the road with their Fiat-style police cruisers. Jon Voight appears as The Voice a disembodied pair of lips seen in closeup who sends Brent Magna his orders via Skype. Selena Gomez plays an abrasive little spud who leaps into the car and just happens to know the key to the convoluted plot. Hawkes unchanging expression is a ""what have I got myself into"" gape that could reflect his characters plight or his own chagrin at signing on for this disgrace. The movies title contains the review. Get away. Warner Bros.

"Getaway movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Sofias choice in ""Getaway""  1/2Car heist film puts the hurt on Bulgaria a and audienceAugust 28 2013|Michael PhillipsSelena Gomez as the Kid and Ethan Hawke as Brent Magna in Warner Bros. and Dark Castle Entertainments action thriller ""Getaway."" (Simon Versano/Warner Brothers)""Getaway"" will never be mistaken for a ""Fast amp; Furious"" sequel. Its more like ""Taken ... for a Ride"" Terrible but in its squealing way sporadically fun-terrible it features a glowering Ethan Hawke as a former professional race car driver named Brent Magna ... or Brock Magma ... or Frack Slaterock ... or something like that. Lets call him Magma.Magma and his wife (Rebecca Budig seen mostly in black-and-white those-were-the-days flashbacks) live in Sofia Bulgaria allowing the producers to film in a city willing to let visitors mess up traffic for a spell.Mrs. Magma is abducted on Christmas and held in a warehouse so that a criminal mastermind listed in the films credits as The Voice (Jon Voight more or less German this time) can blackmail Hawkes character into ""a series of tasks"" behind the wheel of a custom Ford Shelby GT500 Super Snake. These include a high-speed assault on a crowded ice rink and several rounds of police pursuits and evasions. Selena Gomez takes the passenger seat. In one of the weirdest character introductions in the history of any medium her character the least-madcap heiress around known only as The Kid attempts to steal back the car belonging to her. So. You have Magma The Voice and The Kid. This movie is The Dumb.As steered with more enthusiasm than skill by ""An American Haunting"" director Courtney Solomon the takeaway on ""Getaway"" goes this-a-way Is there anything a filmmaker cant do in Sofia Bulgaria? With Los Angeles and environs suffering millions in lost revenue thanks to runaway film production ""Getaway"" serves handily as Exhibit A. Certain shots and the most head-banging stunts on view suggest that you can happily murder all sorts of extras if you film there. The action in ""Getaway"" is hacked up into messily edited bits run through what are supposed to be a dozen different surveillance cameras recording the action inside and outside the death car. With Voights voice on the cars GPS saying things like ""Smash everything you can"" the movie makes its intentions clear.Hawkes character spends most of the film not knowing why The Voice is making him do the things he does. Magma and The Kid trade cross-generational barbs (""Stop almost killing us"" she whines at one point) and develop a grudging mutual respect although if you look up the word ""chemistry"" in the dictionary you wont find a picture of these two actors together. The repeated close-ups of Hawkes foot slamming the clutch are more expressive. The movie requires little acting; it requires screeching -- of tires.I will say this Its perversely satisfying to see the Bulgarian capital roughed up by a movie crew in this way even by second-raters. And near the end theres an extended shot taken with a car-mounted camera reminding audiences of the gut-level pleasures of high velocity. The rest of ""Getaway"" which many in the audience seemed to genuinely hate based on comments on the way out is so mechanical and derivative not even the abducted-spouse routine can stoke the audiences rooting interests. Still I confess After the screening I drove my Honda Fit home like a maniac.mjphillipstribune.com""Getaway"" - 1 1/2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for intense action violence and mayhem throughout some rude gestures and language)Running time 134Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesSelena Gomez Ethan Hawke in Stuntmans Dream Come TrueAugust 27 2013Bulgarian activists vow protests on vote day as anger...May 8 2013Bulgaria to replace new security chief after public backlashJune 15 2013Soviet Bankrolled Plot On Pope AgcaJune 12 1985Find More Stories AboutBulgariaSofiaEthan HawkeTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0828-getaway-20130828,0,824374.column",200,getaway(2013)26,getaway(2013),chicagotribune

(Warner Bros. Pictures) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday August 29 2013 1200 PM Title Getaway Film Info PG-13 Violence language. Area theaters. You would think theres a basic formula for movies about fast-moving vehicles Get character in. Put key in ignition. Get rolling. Unfortunately ""Getaway"" gets itself embroiled in all sorts of inane situations. Then director Courtney Solomon forgets to give us that basic thrill of all car-chase flicks watching the car barrel toward its destination. You know those moments -- theyre in ""Bullitt"" ""Grand Theft Auto"" ""Smokey and the Bandit"" and ""Drive."" ""Getaway"" only delivers a moment like that in the clutch. Ethan Hawke plays Brent Magna -- how about that name? -- a former racecar driver whose wifes been kidnapped. He then gets a call from a lisping vaguely accented gentleman (Jon Voight in a mouth-and-nostrils cameo). The mysterious caller gives Brent a series of banal instructions Steal a cool car from a parking garage. Go through this red light. Hit that truck delivering water bottles. Brent careens through the streets of Sofia Bulgaria. Thats where he lives -- Sofia Bulgaria -- and eventually nearly gets carjacked by a punk kid (a seriously miscast Selena Gomez). She ... wait for it ... is actually the rich kid owner of the souped-up specialized limited-edition Shelby Super Snake Brent has stolen. Even more important however is that the kid is savvy with the computers. So when she discovers that the caller who communicates with them via car phone is watching the whole thing from the cameras in the car (just like in ""Speed"") she does a little hacking to buy some time. To do what? Not stop for gas or bathroom breaks thats for sure. Brent wants his wife safe and he can see on the cars phone-screen that shes being brutalized. So he and the kid devise a plan. The closeups of squealing tires startled onlookers and grainy images of the actors are not what speeding-car movies are for. Hawke whos had one critical hit this summer (""Before Midnight"") and one commercial one (""The Purge"") cant make it three for three. Still his single-minded determined severity travels well. Its unfortunate that he has to make small talk with Gomez whose chipmunk-cheeked sweetness is the exact opposite of punkishness. When she chirps out threats or tries to prove her toughness it feels like shes worried about being grounded. What ""Getaway"" needed most is enough juice to get to the finish line narratively speaking. Because while jumping into the car is great the fun dies fast if theres nowhere to go. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Share Tweet In Getaway Ethan Hawke races a souped-up Shelby Super Snake around Sofia Bulgaria completing Grand Theft Auto-style errands--smash every Christmas decoration in a park outrun the cops for four minutes deliver a USB drive--for a mystery man who is holding his wife hostage. In the process police cars crash ambulances flip and motorcycles get dragged under trolleys. The force of each collision is defused by the movies compound-eye visual style Low-resolution cameras are mounted on the dashboards fenders and rear bumpers of the stunt cars; movement gets dispersed across multiple angles which are cut together rat-tat-tat so that every crash becomes a machine gun burst of grainy visual noise. Hawkes passenger is bratty banking heiress Selena Gomez; the Super Snake was her graduation present and Hawke is instructed to take her hostage after she attempts to steal the car back from him. Aside from Hawke and the unseen mystery man she is the only other character in the film--unnamed with a sentence fragments worth of backstory and a handful of useful skills. The plot--which eventually comes to involve some kind of high-tech bank heist--is irrelevant because Getaway consists mostly of clipped car crashes interspersed with shots of Hawke pretending to drive while Gomez makes shocked faces. Its a car movie where cars are rarely shown moving for very long; director Courtney Solomon (Dungeons amp; Dragons) is more interested in their destructive power. The muscle car--the B-movies go-to symbol of outlaw freedom--becomes a prison which Hawke and Gomez can escape only by destroying other cars. And yet for the most part Getaway lacks tension and violence. Strobe cuts rob the stunts of any sense of motion; twisting metal seen in half-second snippets becomes abstracted texture. While its possible to appreciate this stuff on an individual level it doesnt quite add up to an action-movie whole. Consonance is the key to making a chopped-up aesthetic work; without it Getaway becomes little more than a boneheaded chase flick with unusual camera angles. Solomons car-mounted camera rises above gimmickry only in the climactic chase which is shown largely in a long take from the perspective of the Super Snakes bumper; for a moment the car becomes one with the camera and its power danger and destructive potential become palpable.

Daily Edition Login to download Getaway Film Review 100 PM PDT 8/28/2013 by John DeFore FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS Brainless chase flick doesnt even offer guilty pleasures. TWITTER Ethan Hawke and Selena Gomez turn Sofia Bulgaria into a city-sized car wreck. Director Courtney Solomon wrecks scores of cars and one movie in Getaway a pedal-to-metal flick only an out-of-work stuntman could love. Failing to understand that a chase scene is only exciting for those who care about someone anyone whos part of the action the movie produces untold broken axles but no thrills. A quick exit from theaters is all but guaranteed. Ethan Hawke plays former pro racecar driver Brent Magna -- could we maybe just let that tidbit serve as the entire review? -- who comes home one day to find his wife has been abducted. An anonymous older man (Jon Voight) calls telling Brent that hell never see his wife again unless he goes to a nearby garage steal a souped-up Ford Mustang and await further instruction. The voice doesnt tell Brent he has to wear sunglasses in the parking garage. Brent does this for free. Soon Brents being made to drive willy-nilly through traffic deliberately causing wrecks all around him. Then hes forced to speed straight through parks full of pedestrians down steep stairways into power plants that erupt into flames. Little cameras mounted in and all over the car document his compliance recording every police cruiser that corkscrews through the air in his wake. ""Smash into everything you can"" hes told at one point. We never learn the mystery kidnappers name but its pretty clear hes Michael Bay. Hope you like the lower third of Jon Voights unshaven face because youre going to see it from every conceivable angle as Solomon cuts between the man giving orders and the driver angrily complying. If you were tearing through the streets on an artificial deadline while your disembodied master found five different ways to say ""youre running out of time"" in the space of a minute youd be angry too. (Or maybe its Hawke himself whos angry knowing he has to spend another nine years cranking out this genre junk before its time for another Before Sunrise sequel.) Early on Brent is carjacked by The Kid (Selena Gomez) a gun-toting gearhead; it turns out this is her car which was stolen and retrofitted with armor plating and all those cameras. Mystery Man tells Brent to kill the girl. He refuses which turns out to be smart Though shes a pain in the neck shes some kind of computer genius as well and soon uses her iPad to control MMs camera system. Need to hack into an unfamiliar high-security communications network with fewer taps than it takes to add Selena Gomez to your playlist? Evidently theres an app for that. The Kid is also smart enough to invent -- out of thin air really -- the motivation for the string of random high-speed chase missions Brent is being assigned. Unfortunately her logical insights only stretch so far When their car is being closely tailed down a long narrow ramp by machine-gun-toting motorcyclists doing 100 mph she doesnt point out that Brent could slam his brakes and put an end to all his problems. Baby-faced Gomez is completely out of place as the tough-little-rich-kid though she does earn the films biggest laugh scornfully telling Brent ""you clearly havent thought this through"" at one of the many moments where viewers are thinking the same thing about screenwriters Sean Finegan and Gregg Maxwell Parker. She and Hawke have no chemistry which youd think might hobble a film in which theyre locked in a car together for around 70 minutes. But Getaway seems built for non-English speaking territories in which dialogue is as disposable as Bulgarian police cars. If only those audiences were as dumb as the action itself.

Those seeking an object lesson in the relative value of art and commerce in Hollywood need look no further than Ethan Hawke who kicked off the summer movie season with Richard Linklaters ""Before Midnight"" and now brings it to a close with ""Getaway"" another tale of an American expat winding his way through an exotic foreign locale. Only here instead of thoughtful discourse about love and sex and aging against the stunning vistas of Greece we get the grinding gears of a souped-up Shelby Mustang racing through grimy Bulgaria with It Girl Selena Gomez in tow. Arriving in theaters on the sputtering exhaust of producer Joel Silvers longtime Warner Bros. deal this booby prize of a parting gift may nevertheless score some quick cash from undiscriminating Labor Day moviegoers hoping against hope for some ""Fast amp; Furious""-level thrills.This story first appeared in the September 03 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. Easily one of the dopiest major studio releases since Elie Samaha got out of the business ""Getaway"" marks the not-very-anticipated return to the directors chair of low-budget horror producer Courtney Solomon whose prior helming credits include the risible 2000 adaptation of ""Dungeons amp; Dragons"" and 2005s wan historical ghost story ""An American Hunting"" (where the scariest special effect was the squandering of stars Sissy Spacek and Donald Sutherland). Here Solomon tries for his best Kathryn Bigelow or George Romero thrusting us straight into the action in medias res with Hawke and the aforementioned Shelby careening wildly through a crowded Sofia park and adjacent pedestrian mall crowded with Christmas shoppers. In a script (credited to tyro scribes Sean Finegan and Gregg Maxwell Parker) otherwise mercifully devoid of backstory a few staccato flashes fill in the essentials Earlier the same day Hawkes wife (Rebecca Budig) was kidnapped from their apartment by villains of unknown motive and ever since a mystery voice (Jon Voight) on the other end of Hawkes cell phone has been issuing directives. Do what he says says the voice or his wife gets it. Oh and Hawkes character is supposed to be a washed-up ex-NASCAR driver named Brent Magra a name that pretty much guarantees he isnt a bank teller or a CPA. During a brief respite after the opening melee a feisty teen (Gomez) appears brandishing a handgun and claiming to be the Shelbys rightful owner. But despite the brusque meet-cute Gomezs unnamed character (billed only as ""The Girl"") isnt quite the girl-gone-wild she played to great effect earlier this year in Harmony Korines ""Spring Breakers."" In this pics fanciful universe shes supposed to be a whiz-kid computer hacker though none of the techno-babble she spews about servers and video feeds and compromised firewalls suggests she would know her way around even a Commodore 64. Shes also the daughter of an investment bank CEO with headquarters in Sofia (perhaps because hes investing in runaway Hollywood productions like this) suggesting that like Brent she isnt here by accident. An extended demolition derby follows as Hawke and Gomez follow Voights demands (""Turn left Turn right Youre running out of time"") the American muscle car nimbly outpacing the Sofia police and their fleet of shoddy Euro-made sedans. In terms of sheer onscreen destruction ""Getaway"" can hold its own with any ""Fast amp; Furious"" pic but without any of that series exuberance at creating elaborate Rube Goldberg-like chains of balletic action. Rather Solomon has made something like a ""Cannonball Run"" for the YouTube Generation with the largely incoherent action photographed (by cinematographer Yaron Levy) from dozens of small digital cameras mounted inside and outside the Shelby and cut in a Cuisinart. (The press notes boast that the pic contains more than 6000 cuts as opposed to the average 1600 as though this were a good thing.) Matched to an eardrum-endangering sound mix this is that rare action movie thats at its most pleasurable during its fleeting fades to black. Though its impossible to fault the precision driving of veteran stunt coordinator Charlie Picerni Sr. once youve seen one Bulgarian police cruiser sail off a pipe ramp or flip over on its roof the next 40 or 50 lose some of their luster. Only in the pics final stretch when Solomon actually holds for more than a few seconds on a POV hood shot clearly modeled on Claude Lelouchs celebrated racing short ""Rendezvous"" does ""Getaway"" arrive at a single memorable image. Cast in a rare tough-guy role Hawke plays it with reasonable conviction though its impossible to say if his weariness is that of a pro racer who bottomed out or a serious actor trapped in the ninth circle of movie hell. Gomez never seems more imperiled than if shed broken a nail. Voight seen only as lips stubble and yellowed teeth until the pics final scene literally and figuratively phones it in.

Reply Go_Todash says August 31 2013 at 644 am Sure she has.

Can Tom Hanks Get His Groove Back? An endless noisy montage of chases and collisions whose most interesting character is quite literally a disembodied voice ""Getaway"" is a movie for people who think ""Taken"" is too complicated. Perhaps more suitably titled ""GoPro The Movie"" director Courtney Solomons car-chase movie mounts a dozen cameras all over a Shelby Mustang Super Snake cranks up the adrenaline and offers a first-person account of a wild goose chase to rescue a kidnapped spouse. Unfortunately bereft of any sense of spatial geography other than between the cars driver and his unwitting passenger ""Getaway"" is an endless noisy montage of chases and collisions stitched together by perfunctory exposition whose most interesting character is quite literally a disembodied voice. Also read 20 Movies Were Dying to See This Fall Ethan Hawke aiming to earn the title of Summer 2013s Hardest Working Actor ditches relationship peccadilloes and undercooked home-invasion scenarios to play Brent Magna a disgraced racer who arrives home to discover that his wife has been taken hostage. Receiving instructions to steal a car thats custom-designed for his driving skills Magna soon finds himself plowing through populated areas and evading the authorities at the behest of a mysterious stranger (Jon Voight). But after a young woman (Selena Gomez) tracks him down asking him to return what turns out to be her car Magna begins to realize there is something larger afoot than petty errands and formulates a plan to rescue his wife while turning the tables on her kidnappers. See video Ethan Hawke and Selena Gomez Race the Clock in Getaway Trailer Mercifully the film wastes no time introducing the characters or setting up their world; following a flashback scene in which Magnas wife (Rebecca Budig) is apprehended while decorating their Christmas tree the driver is in the car and on the asphalt. This streamlined approach unfortunately proves to be an obstacle to believability especially after Gomez character shows up and as the story needs she is incapable of increasingly sophisticated technological feats. That the film covers all of its bases in setting up the inescapability of Magnas situation is admirable but its thoroughness becomes a problem later when hes conspiring against his wifes kidnappers. (If you point out that The Voice is constantly listening to them via a hidden microphone and do nothing to remove it hes probably still privy to your conversations -- especially if youre planning something.) Also read 7 of Falls Burning Box-Office Questions Will Horror Rule Again? Can Tom Hanks Get His Groove Back? That said its screenwriting transgressions might be forgivable if at the very least the driving footage was impressive -- or even say comprehensible. But even with cameras on every corner of the car inside and out Solomon seems incapable of assembling a sequence during any time of which the audience can see where Magna is driving how many people are pursuing him and how he plausibly could escape them without totaling his beautiful ride. With the exception of one unbroken shot where Magna and another vehicle are locked in pursuit which quite frankly is stunning there is nothing to distinguish any of the chases from the others especially since hes assigned to do virtually the same thing each time -- namely attract the police then evade them. Hawke commits to the intensity of Magnas quest with all of the conviction of a man en route to cash a desperately needed paycheck while Gomez demonstrates that her performance as the group lightweight in ""Spring Breakers"" was no fluke -- she truly possesses no discernible depth or substance. (She is however believably annoying.) As The Voice meanwhile Voight seems to be parodying ""Eyes Wide Shut"" actor Rade Serbedzijas actual eastern European accent but at least he seems to be having fun with the role. But the films one unique achievement is in avoiding any similarities to either Sam Peckinpah or Roger Donaldsons adaptation of Jim Thompsons novel ""Getaway"" and yet managing to be even more derivative than if it were a third one. With the ""Fast and Furious"" films Jason Bourne and Liam Neeson already occupying lanes cinematically speaking ""Getaway"" embarks on a race its already lost mostly because it cant seem to figure out where the road is in the first place.

"Getaway (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Getaway (PG-13) A feature-length car chase disguised as a movie starring Ethan Hawke and Selena Gomez. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com8/28/2013 Editor rating 1 In Getaway Selena Gomez plays The Kid aka The Worlds Most Irritating Carjacker. At first shes totally adorable trying to look tough in a hoodie and baseball cap as she points a gun at Brent (Ethan Hawke) and demands he hand over the souped-up Shelby Super Snake Mustang hes driving. But Brent a former NASCAR star cant do that. His wife (Rebecca Budig) has been kidnapped and her mysterious captor (played by extreme close-ups of Jon Voights mouth and eyeballs) is ordering Brent via cell phone to wreak major damage on the streets of Sofia Bulgaria -- plowing through public parks at high speeds causing accidents even blowing up a power station. The men who work for Voights mouth/eyeballs have even placed multiple cameras inside the car so Brent is constantly being watched. His situation is stressful enough but the crisis is exacerbated by The Kids relentless whinings ""Youre an idiot"" ""What do you want?"" ""Please stop"" ""What are you doing?"" ""Why is this happening?"" ""No dont"" ""Ow Help"" ""I hate you."" Occasionally The Kid who often brags about having gone to college busts out her ability to speak in longer sentences such as ""You could encrypt the information on a numeric transfer key."" Fortunately The Kid also owns a magical iPad that allows her to access everything from bank schematics to traffic patterns (the movie is practically a feature-length ad for Apple products). Despite the characters usefulness Gomez is so irritating in the role that I kept wishing Spring Breakers James Franco would swoop in and whisk her back to Florida. And Hawke who spends almost the entire movie behind the wheel emotes as much as he can via clenched jaws and furiously intent stares. He does his best. They cant all be Before Midnight. Getaway was directed by Courtney Solomon who knows how to orchestrate some remarkable chase sequences (almost all of the car crashes in the film are real with only a sprinkling of CGI). But then he ruins most of them by never holding a shot for more than four seconds before cutting away. Many shots last exactly one second. Getaway makes the Transformers movies seem like they were shot in slow motion. You see all these vehicles smashing into each other but the movie is never thrilling aside from a remarkable sustained take in which we follow a SVU hurtling through a highway running red lights and narrowly avoiding accidents for almost two minutes without cutting away. Its a bravura piece of filmmaking in an otherwise worthless movie. Even if youre willing to go along with Getaway as a brainless entertainment the picture keeps throwing up obstacles that distract you. The Shelby Mustang isnt just the fastest car in all of Bulgaria It also has the ability to heal itself like Wolverine. Despite being constantly battered and rammed by other vehicles the Mustang rarely sports a dent. In one scene the drivers side is full of bullet holes even though no one has opened fire yet on our heroes. In the following scene the bullet holes disappear. And in order for the picture to work Sofias cops are required to behave like the most inept police force on the planet. Never once in this grating irritating picture does anyone ever think of simply shooting out the Mustangs tires. Cast Ethan Hawke Selena Gomez Jon Voight Rebecca Budig. Director Courtney Solomon.

An interminable and boldly incoherent car chase masquerading as a feature film Courtney Solomons ""Getaway"" is to the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise what ""The Paperboy"" is to ""Citizen Kane"" until suddenly - for nearly two minutes of the penultimate scene - the film achieves a breathlessly sublime cinematic purity providing in one glorious long-take a spectacle unmatched by the entirety of even the summers most over-sized blockbusters. But the juice to quote ""The Girl Next Door"" (as fine criticism always should) is not worth the squeeze. Not by a damn sight. The 80 minutes or so that precede the transcendent shot the inordinate thrills of which in no way require any narrative context to enjoy amount to one of the years most punishing and pointless endurance tests. Remember that ""Simpsons"" episode in which Homer having decided that hes going to start consuming all of his meals in bar form pulverizes eight pounds of spaghetti into a short cylinder of pure starch and gulps it down in one bite? Homer thinks for a moment takes stock of how his body is reacting to his ridiculously dense pasta snack and calmly dials the operator on his phone ""Hospital please."" Thats ""Getaway"" 6000 cuts recklessly crammed into a movie that only works when it eschews montage altogether the film at its best when it uses distinctly computer-age tools to capture unmistakably analog (and shockingly dangerous) feats of daredevil driving. In a time when our biggest movie moments are engineered from 1s and 0s ""Getaway"" feels like an almost Herzogian bit of madness if only Solomon werent blinking too fast to maintain a coherent vision. The film sure doesnt waste any time so narratively threadbare that theres hardly any difference between its premise and its plot. We open on driver Brent Magna (played by a courageous squad of stunt doubles who closely resemble a grizzled Ethan Hawke) a retired Nascar driver endowed with the name of a jaeger pilot and the complete lack of compelling characterization of well a jaeger pilot. Magna retires to his apartment in downtown Sofia to find the place ransacked and his wife missing. A phone call from a mysterious voice (Jon Voight as Rade Serbedzija) informs Magna that his wife has been taken and if he ever wants to see her again he needs to get behind the wheel of the seemingly death proof 2008 Shelby Super Snake thats waiting for him in a local garage and await further instructions. Further instructions Magna soon learns are relayed to him directly through the cars dashboard from which the Voice can both see and hear everything that happens in and around the vehicle. Magna naturally assumes that hes transporting illicit materials or something to that effect but no that would make far too much sense. Instead the Voice effectively wants Magna to LARP ""Grand Theft Auto"" commanding the burned out wheelman to bomb around the gorgeous Bulgarian metropolis at insane speeds the giddy directions imploring Magna to smash into everything in his path in a fit of vehicular rampage which Magna is uniquely qualified to execute. The Voices hilariously convoluted plan eventually comes into focus but not before Magna is carjacked by a teenage girl (Selena Gomez as ""The Kid"") who quickly becomes an unwitting accomplice in Magnas high-speed quest to save his wife. Whereas Gomezs blank cherub appeal was a perfect fit for the soulless hedonism of Harmony Korines ""Spring Breakers"" in ""Getaway"" shes a useless foil to Hawkes high-octane husband in crisis their lame verbal sparring and her preternatural abilities as a hacker so resoundingly inauthentic that they almost completely negate the tactile pleasures of the films squelching mayhem. To that point the sole virtue of Solomons ""Getaway"" is - or perhaps should have been - how it almost completely eschews weightless computer-generated effects for the real deal. The decision to rely on practical stunts  - a reaction to the ""Fast and Furious"" juggernaut as well as a concession to the fact that its cheaper to actually fish-tale a car into a Bulgarian lamppost than it is to fake it believably - might have validated the films existence as Solomon and his brave stunt crew were essentially allowed to transform a historic Eastern European city into the ultimate demolition derby. Unfortunately ""Getaway"" isnt content to be a throwback to an older way of doing things as Solomons ultimate loyalty isnt reserved for the past but rather for the future the movie rendered unwatchable by its split devotion between refreshingly physical wreckage and uniquely digital ways of capturing it. Whereas ""Speed"" allowed the villain to surveil his runaway guinea pigs because he had to The Voice pastes tiny low-resolution cameras on the hood of its star vehicle simply because he can. Blessed with previously impossible ways of seeing ""Getaway"" should have done for race cars what ""Leviathan"" did for fishing boats but Solomon was seduced by the remarkable technology available to him. Why shoot a scene with 40 different cameras (bolted onto rear-view mirrors road signs and even the road itself)? Well why not? The problem isnt a lack of angles its a lack of discipline. Had Solomon restricted himself to the cameras bolted onto the body of his star Shelby ""Getaway"" might at least have been a neat formal exercise. But Solomon lost sight of the fact that being able to put cameras anywhere isnt a good reason to put cameras everywhere. And Solomon naturally wants to show his work and so he does his best to make sure that the audience is made aware of every one of those cameras a tactic which doesnt result in a progressive series of related images so much as it does a dissociative gumbo of twisted metal - somewhere in here is the greatest movie that Stan Brakhage never made. Which finally brings us to the films one euphoric moment. As the long chase winds down in the early light of day and Magna seems to be closing in on the villain Solomon risks his precious nanosecond ASL with a breathtaking 95-second shot captured from a RED One camera mounted to the front-end mask of the Shelby as it drag-races the villains Mercedes SUV at 90 miles per hour along the outskirts of town. While the speed of the shot is slightly ramped to enhance the effect theres nevertheless a palpable thrill to the credibility of whats on display - the film for all of its extraordinary flaws has reconditioned us to trust in the reality of what were seeing. The movie cars dash through an intersection narrowly avoiding real-life traffic by a matter of inches. Its illegal its insane its utterly irresponsible and its incredible. (Read Film.coms interview with Courtney Solomon where he discusses the unbelievable logistics of how they pulled it off). The money shot is spectacle at its simplest harkening back to the primal pleasures of early cinema. Its about seeing rather than being shown perspective rather than creation. Its the best thing that mainstream cinema has produced all summer and - damningly - its a moment empowered by digital technology but in no way enabled by it (as Claude Lelouch proved in 1976 Solomons feat is novel only in how much footage the director was able to chop off at either end of his long-take thanks to a hard drive being able to contain more footage than a 35mm film mag). The rest of the films use of digital technology is about seeing what otherwise could not be seen placing cameras where they previously could not be placed and destroying objects that were previously too costly to risk.  But to what end? Tools are but blunt instruments in the hands of someone who doesnt know how to wield them whereas in capable hands they become conduits of expression. A camera can either be a device or it can be a medium and the difference between the two is the only thing that ""Getaway"" is able to depict with an iota of clarity.
