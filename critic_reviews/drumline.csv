Chism Shawn Schepps; Release Date Wide 12/13/2002; Runtime (in minutes) 119; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor 20th Century Fox Film Corporation Posted December 13 2002 -- 1200 AM EST Drumline does more than capture the excitement of marching bands; it gets their clockwork beauty as well. Photographed in vibrant close-up the darting flashes of white glove the thrashing synchronicity of the drumbeats and the spin-on-a-dime military precision combine to make you feel as if youre standing in the nerve center of a glittering funk machine. When Devon Miles (Nick Cannon) the new snare drummer at Aamp;T University in Atlanta gets his chance to perform a solo during a halftime show his mouth twists with pleasure at what a great drummer he is. What he doesnt realize is that his desire to smash that snare in louder wilder and ever more intricate ways grows directly out of the power of the group itself. Devon in other words is a hotshot who has to learn to be a team player. ""Drumline"" is unabashedly a kind of collegiate ""Top Drum"" but the director Charles Stone III keeps the tensions flowing - between the rivals on the field between rap rhythm and old-school soul. Mr. Lee (Orlando Jones) who runs the marching-band program like basic training insists that his musicians ignore the nastiness of hip-hop for the glories of Earth Wind amp; Fire; he may be right about EWF but he has a lesson to learn too. Jones proves theres an actor of force behind those popping eyes. ""Drumline"" is a superlative B movie - funny sexy and rousing. It made me want to get in line for whatever Stone does next.

Brimming with heart and humor slickly packaged comedy-drama should register strong crossover biz. Shrewdly positioned by Fox to strut its stuff as a high-stepping sleeper during the holiday season ""Drumline"" is a formulaic crowdpleaser set in the competitive world of university marching bands at predominantly black universities. Brimming with heart and humor slickly packaged comedy-drama should register strong crossover biz in theatrical showcases then profitably encore as homevid product. Reportedly based in part on high school band experiences of music producer-songwriter Dallas Austin pics executive producer ""Drumline"" cleverly reconfigures cliches usually employed in military-training dramas -- think ""Top Gun"" or ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" -- while charting the slow-but-steady maturing of a raw cocksure talent. Harlem-born hip-hop drummer Devon Miles (Nick Cannon) earns a full music scholarship to Atlanta Aamp;T U. and arrives on campus convinced of his superstar potential. His self-assurance dims only slightly as he realizes that like anyone else in the Aamp;T lineup hell have to endure a grueling training-and-hazing regimen not unlike a Marine boot camp. Indeed Devon is so unshakably confident if not downright arrogant he goes out of his way to antagonize the very person whos most capable of making his life miserable -- senior class drumline leader Sean Taylor (Leonard Roberts). Dr. Lee (Orlando Jones) Aamp;Ts demanding and dedicated band director has little patience for attention-hogging prima donnas (""One band one sound"" is his motto) and even less regard for rap or hip-hop. He admits his musical tastes are old-school -- more Earth Wind and Fire less Snoop Dogg -- and insists showmanship must never obscure musicianship. Trouble is Lees traditionalism has begun to annoy Aamp;Ts image-conscious president Wagner (Afem Omilami) whod like to see a bit more showmanship during halftime shows. When Devon calls attention to himself during a spirited solo turn Wagner is pleased; Lee isnt. Scriptwriters Tina Gordon Chism and Shawn Schepps intro character-changing conflict when Devon is unmasked -- thanks to Seans maneuvering -- as musically illiterate and kicked off the band until he learns how to read notes. The banishment places Aamp;T at a disadvantage as it prepares for a nationally telecast college band competition and Devon is sorely tempted to transfer to a rival college where the flamboyant band director (J. Anthony Brown) is less scrupulous about musicianship or good-sportsmanship. Under smooth direction of Charles Stone III (helmer of recent much grittier ""Paid in Full"") Cannon -- popular star of his own self-titled Nickelodeon cable-TV series -- makes a strong impression in his first pic lead. Character could have come across as an off-putting egotist but young actor effectively counterbalances cockiness with charm and vulnerability. Hes particularly engaging during scenes opposite Zoe Saldana who makes the most of her role as mandatory romantic interest. Orlando Jones usually cast in broadly comic parts gets a welcome chance to expand his range with an effortlessly authoritative perf as the firm but fair band director. A few other supporting characters -- including an ""affirmative action"" white drummer (actor GQ) and a femme novice (Candace Carey) whos teasingly dubbed ""G.I. Jane"" during band boot camp -- are intriguing but underdeveloped. Tech values are aces across the board and the soundtrack -- featuring a nice mix of traditional and contempo tunes -- should spawn peppy CD sales. Scenes set on fictional Aamp;T campus were shot on Georgia locations at Clark Atlanta U. and Morris Brown College.

Starring Nick Cannon Zoe Saldana Orlando Jones Leonard Roberts GQ Jason Weaver and Earl Poitier. Directed by Charles Stone III. Written by Shawn Schepps and Tina Gordon Chism. (PG-13. 118 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Heres why ""Drumline"" a movie about a mostly black college marching band is similar to ""8 Mile"" the hit film starring the white rapper Eminem Both are about young urban men from disadvantaged backgrounds (""Drumline"" focuses on a teen drummer from Harlem named Devon Miles) who try to make it big and stumble -- badly -- before facing a climactic test that will prove or disprove their obvious talent. Dont dismiss ""Drumline"" just because compared with rap its about a much older more traditional form of music. These arent the marching band songs of your fathers or mothers generation but a musical expression that is modern and exciting to watch. There are even scenes in ""Drumline"" that approximate ones in ""8 Mile"" -- especially the tension-filled scenes near the end that showcase the college band of fictional Atlanta Aamp;T University vying against a rival band for a winner-take-all jackpot of 100000. Nick Cannon (Nickelodeons ""The Nick Cannon Show"") plays the gifted freshman from Harlem who drives Atlanta Aamp;Ts band to greater heights and in this role Cannon is magnetic. The entire movie Devon Miles struggles to control his tendency to show off at the expense of everyone else. He cant be like a rap star who commands center stage. With every note he plays he has to work with his band mates. Without them hes nothing. Without him theyre nothing. Cannon turns his character into a complex figure with bravado charm -- and animus. Devon hates his father who left the family long ago and works in a token booth in a New York subway. When Devon graduates from high school he rushes off to his dads workplace and practically spits at him saying ""I got my diploma. Unlike yourself Im doing something with my music. I made it without you"" With a drumming scholarship at Atlanta Aamp;T Devon apparently has made it but reality interrupts his new sense of self. Though he makes the universitys premier band (freshmen usually sit out their first year) a jealous classmate reveals Devons secret He cant read music thus failing a basic requirement of his scholarship. The schools band leader Dr. Aaron Lee (played in standout fashion by Orlando Jones) kicks Devon off the squad berating him for lying about his musical comprehension and for being such a showoff and agitator in practice. Lee is the father that Devon never had -- an educated reasonably successful disciplinarian who clearly loves his new student but is irritated by his aggressive approach to music and life. In the meantime a romance challenges Devon and this is where the movie suffers a bit because it devolves into cliches and scenes that are overly scripted. As soon as he arrives on campus Devon falls for a beautiful older student from the South named Laila (Zoe Saldana Britney Spears co-star in ""Crossroads"") who returns his affection. Their kisses are filmed in slow motion. They go to parties where Laila whos a cheerleader and her cheerleader friends show off their moves and their beauty. Its all so perfect until (of course) it goes wrong and then (of course) it goes well again. Director Charles Stone III is best known for the ""Whassuup?"" TV commercials he does for Budweiser and the music videos he did for groups like Public Enemy and Living Colour. Knowing this its easier to understand the sudden scene shifts in ""Drumline."" The first 20 minutes seem to feature a different scene every 60 seconds -- a dizzying pace that would have been more disconcerting if Cannons character werent so interesting. Cannon doesnt steal this movie as much as he anchors it well supported by a buoyant cast that includes Leonard Roberts (""He Got Game"") as Devons jealous classmate Sean. Enemies become friends in ""Drumline"" lessons are learned and even the grown-ups come to realizations that didnt seem possible. All that and decent music too. Its not a bad way to spend a couple of hours.

But if its conventional its also competent. Thanks to director Charles Stone III (of the famed ""Whassuup?"" Budweiser spots) the cliches at least have a good beat. Lead Nick Cannon direct from his own Nickelodeon show has to walk a fine line in his big-screen debut. As the Harlem-raised winner of a full music scholarship to join the drum line of an Atlanta university his character needs to be a pain yet not so unbearable that you long to shove him into a tuba. Riding into town on a bus he has some of the swagger of a gunslinger about to take Dodge City. After the schools straight-arrow band director (Orlando Jones) refuses to give more than an inch nearly two overly long hours of head-butting begins. Movie review Drumline ( out of four) Stars Nick Cannon Zoe Saldana Orlando Jones Leonard Roberts Gregory Qaiyum Director Charles Stone III Distributor 20th Century Fox Rating PG-13 for innuendo and language Opens Friday nationwide Cannon proceeds to show up Jones his marching-band colleagues and musicians from a rival school precipitating a fracas. His older girlfriend (Zoe Saldana) has a limited lot. Shes either shaking her bare midriff provocatively on the field or showing up periodically to tsk-tsk Cannons behavior. Casting helps. In addition to Jones excellent performance in a rare non-comic role Leonard Roberts seethes credibly as an envious senior without the freshmans talent. And J. Anthony Brown is funny as a loose laissez-faire kind of rival band director -- a jewel stud in his earlobe and the kind of guy who in a different era or milieu might have run a numbers racket. Stone makes the drum competition scenes already inherently photogenic stirring to watch although there certainly are a lot of them. The movie is enough on the high side of just what youd expect to explain the shift in its release date. Once a candidate for the January dumping ground Drumline is now in the competition -- in December where the big kids play.
