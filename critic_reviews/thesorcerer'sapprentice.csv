Cage plays Balthazar Blake a mage locked in a long war of wills with sleazy power-hungry warlock Horvath (Alfred Molina) until the appearance of bumbling student physicist and natural magician Dave (Jay Baruchel) threatens to tip the balance. Cue training montages wacky mop-based mishaps and deafening plasma-bolt battles on New Yorks streets. With Cage playing it relatively straight and serious the show is stolen by moustache-twirling Molina and his David Copperfield-inspired acolyte Drake essayed with oily glee by Toby Kebbell. But with Baruchels likeable lead turn hamstrung by a disastrous romantic subplot some distinctly non-special effects and a script loaded with blunt expository dialogue the film casts a superficial and short-lived spell.

By Peter Rainer Film critic July 14 2010 Save for later Saved Nicolas Cage left and Jake Cherry are shown in a scene from the new movie The Sorcerers Apprentice. Robert Zuckerman/Disney/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of One of the most magical of all animated movie sequences features Mickey Mouse wildly splish-splashing and abracadabra-ing his way through ""The Sorcerers Apprentice"" sequence from Disneys ""Fantasia."" Now Disney via the inevitable Jerry Bruckheimer has come up with ""The Sorcerers Apprentice"" starring Nicolas Cage. He cant hold a candle to Mickey.Looking less like a sorcerer than like someone who lives under a freeway overpass Cages Balthazar Blake is a 1400-year-old Merlin disciple on the prowl to locate the boy known as the Prime Merlinean. This is not to put it gently the most exciting monicker for somebody who is prophesied to battle dead souls from the dark side - the sub-Prime Merlineans? - who are threatening to take over the planet.The sub-Primes are under the tutelage of Balthazars archnemesis Maxim Horvath (Alfred Molina). The Merlinean turns out to be a gangly New York physics whiz named Dave Butler (Jay Baruchel). As you might expect from a Bruckheimer extravaganza theres some kind of mayhem going on every minute but much of it is familiar from other movies such as ""The Mummy"" that werent any better than this one. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? If the actors were as forgettable as the action ""The Sorcerers Apprentice"" directed by Jon Turtletaub would resemble nothing so much as one long trailer for itself but Cage is amusingly skanky Molina is dependably arch and Baruchel is engagingly down to earth. But do we really need to watch them play out this exhaustingly empty scenario? And do we really need another franchise from Jerry Bruckheimer? Vote with your feet. Grade C (Rated PG for fantasy action violence some mild rude humor and brief language.)

Cage stars as Balthazar Blake the ancient sorcerer who takes Baruchels reluctant physics major Dave Stutler under his wing. Movie Information The Sorcerers ApprenticeRatingShowtimes | Official siterDirector Jon TurteltaubStarring Nicolas Cage Jay Baruchel Alfred Molina Alice Krige Monica Belluci and Teresa PalmerRun time 110 minutesMPAA rating PG (fantasy action violence some mild rude humor and brief language)Synopsis No Mickey Mouse here. Disney does another take with Nicolas Cage as the sorcerer in this film.More movies from GuideLive.comMuch of the film conforms to fantasy formula but it has twists. Cage hypnotic even when slumming is the wise teacher with a dissipated dark depressed demeanor rather than the warm and gentle avuncular look of Gandalf or Dumbledore. Like Harry and the Pevensie children of Narnia before him Dave is the young hero destined to save life as we know it. Dave is also in love.Indeed the film opens a bit jerkily almost as if it cant decide which story is dominant. First Merlins apprentice Balthazar is entrusted with the mission of finding a successor to destroy evil. Then we meet Dave as a young boy mooning over a girl who inadvertently ends up in a shop where he meets Balthazar.In a variation of Arthur pulling the sword from the stone Dave reveals he is the chosen one by bringing a magical ring to life. Unfortunately that also kicks off his first battle against evil Maxim Horvath played by the always-impressive Alfred Molina who moves so seamlessly from classic roles to comic-book villains like Spider-Man 2 s Doc Ock.The encounter leaves Balthazar entrapped in a jar for years until Dave grows up and Balthazar escapes and seeks him out.There is much thats appealing from the performances to the scene where Turteltaub re-creates a live-action version of the classic scene from Disneys Fantasia. Dave in a hurry to clean up for a visit from the woman he loves invokes a magical spell without knowing how to end it.Fantasies seem to thrive with kids at the core. Even in Lord of the Rings Bilbo and Frodo while grown men seemed childlike because of their small stature and innocence. The film adaptations of the richly detailed book-based worlds of Lord of the Rings Harry Potter The Chronicles of Narnia and Twilight did ultimately break down age barriers. Can The Sorcerers Apprentice with a screenplay inspired by a scene from another film do the same?It just doesnt feel like a powerful enough spell. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

"Movie review Nicolas Cages Sorcerers Apprentice is a magical misfire washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On The Sorcerers Apprentice Movie review Nicolas Cages Sorcerers Apprentice is a magical misfire Try as he might Nicolas Cage left with Jay Baruchel cant save ""The Sorcerers Apprentice"" with his performance as a wizard. (Robert Zuckerman/copyright Disney Enterprises) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Friday July 16 2010 Despite some whiz-bang special effects and a moderately unhinged performance by Nicolas Cage as Balthazar Blake an ancient wizard at work in modern-day New York one nagging question keeps popping up in ""The Sorcerers Apprentice"" Where have I seen this before? The answer in this flat-footed fantasy is not what you might think. While its true that the live-action film is based loosely on Disneys animated classic ""Fantasia"" (or at least the portion of that 1940 film that featured Mickey Mouse as a hapless wizards apprentice) the connection is tenuous. This despite a sequence in the new movie that depicts out-of-control animated mops and buckets as in the old one. The CGI upgrade altough visually impressive lacks the charm of the hand-drawn original. Its bigger but far from better. No this ""Apprentice"" has far more recent antecedents. In its story line about a geeky wizard-in-training named Dave (Jay Baruchel) and his grizzled mentor (Cage) it shares large chucks of DNA with the ""Harry Potter"" series. Just like J.K. Rowlings hero Dave is a kind of chosen one -- a powerful yet unseasoned sorcerer known as the ""Prime Merlinian"" -- who prophecy foretells will one day rise up to defeat the forces of black magic in the person of evil sorcerer Horvath (Alfred Molina). Okay so Horvath is no Lord Voldemort. Hes kind of clownish in fact and has his own apprentice a Vegas-style magician named Drake (Toby Kebbell). But as the movies chief evildoer the sorceress Morgana le Fay Alice Krige bears a striking resemblance to Helena Bonham Carters Bellatrix Lestrange from the ""Harry Potter"" movies down to her wild eyes and ""Bride of Frankenstein"" hair. All thats missing seemingly are Ron and Hermione. Not that ""The Sorcerers Apprentice"" is completely without its own late adolescent angst. There are frequent breaks in the action -- which truth be told is none too shabby -- to follow a subplot involving Daves awkward attempts to court his blonde college classmate (Teresa Palmer). During those scenes in which Baruchel recycles the stammering-nerd routine he perfected in ""Shes Out of My League"" the movie loses all momentum. It takes every ounce of magic Balthazar can muster to get it back. And speaking of Balthazar Cage doesnt disappoint. Hes just manic enough to keep the character from becoming predictable. Mores the pity then that he has to cede so much screen time to his characters young protege. With his irritatingly nasal voice and yet another twitchily mannered performance Baruchel will remain for many an acquired taste. The movies tag line is ""Its the coolest job ever"" but I suspect itll take more than this ""Apprentice""-ship to learn to love its star.  1/2 PG. At area theaters. Contains fantasy action violence mildly crude language and brief bathroom humor. 109 minutes.

Jennie Punter The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Jul. 14 2010 500AM EDT Last updated Thursday Jul. 15 2010 200PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Sorcerers Apprentice Directed by Jon Turteltaub Screenplay by Matt Lopez Doug Miro and Carlo Bernard Starring Jay Baruchel Nicolas Cage Alfred Molina Toby Kebbell and Teresa Palmer Classification PG With Harry Potters next wand-waving adventure landing in the fall its up to Montreal actor Jay Baruchel to deliver some youth-oriented summer movie magic in The Sorcerers Apprentice a fantasy-thriller-comedy that moderately enchants thanks to a non-stop barrage of special-effects pyrotechnics and the onscreen alchemy of four fine character actors. But not much else. Ponderously silly opening ""backstory"" lore informs us that Balthazar Blake (Nicolas Cage) an apprentice of Merlin long ago has been combing the world for centuries in search of ""the prime Merlinean"" (try saying that mouthful 10 times fast) who will inherit the great sorcerers power and is the only one who can save the world (yawn) should Morgana Le Fay (Alice Maud Krige) escape from the Grimhold - a nest-of-dolls ""prison"" with the evil sorceress in the centre and various Morganians layered around her. The chosen one is Manhattan physics major Dave Stutler (Baruchel) a nerd so brainy that his university gives him a nifty subterranean lab (an abandoned subway turnaround) where he can be alone with his Tesla coils. Balthazar (Cage in a shaggier version of the motivated oddballs he frequently plays) finds Dave using the latest in geolocation magic. But so does his nemesis Horvath (Alfred Molina) a former Merlin disciple turned Morganian who believes Dave has the Grimhold. The object is soon geolocated in Chinatown a spectacular setting for a good-versus-evil showdown after which Dave very reluctantly agrees to become Balthazars apprentice to harness his budding gifts. Meanwhile Horvath finds his own apprentice Russell Brand-style illusionist Drake Stone (Toby Kebbell) who is more interested in the fame girls and lavish lifestyle his tricks have brought him. With the evil duo closing in Balthazar rushes to complete Daves training; the only trouble is Dave is more interested in the fetching Becky Barnes (Teresa Palmer). Love versus duty magic versus science good versus evil - the classic conflicts are touched on here but their potential is not satisfyingly explored. Instead we get a standard-issue car chase through Times Square. What started in 1797 as a 14-stanza poem ( Der Zauberlehrling) by Goethe one of the more important writers and thinkers in Western culture is now the latest slice of branded entertainment from Jerry Bruckheimer one of the more successful producers of blockbuster films and TV series in the Western world today. Connecting these two cultural dots are the 1897 Goethe-inspired symphonic piece The Sorcerers Apprentice by French composer Paul Dukas and the famous animated short (based on the Goethe poem set to Dukass music and starring Mickey Mouse) from the 1940 Disney classic Fantasia. The film from the National Treasure brain trust of Bruckheimer Cage and director Jon Turteltaub pays homage to its legacy in a scene in which Dave clean ups his underground lab/sorcery-training ring before Becky arrives. Its fun to watch brooms and mops causing havoc and water flooding the lab as Dave emerges from freshening up and gets all Mickey Mouse with an axe. The lively verbal sparring between the good and evil sorcerer-apprentice pairs sustains the movie but with a predictable plot by-the-numbers action-movie jolts and no real sense of wonder The Sorcerers Apprentice is really just a pumpkin.

Comments click to enlarge The Sorcerers Apprentice Rated PG  109 minutes  2010 Once the filmmakers have dispensed with a grueling expository preface set in Arthurian England this shameless Harry Potter knockoff is a pretty tasty bucket of popcorn. Bad wizards led by Alfred Molina (magnificent as ever) plot to steal a magical dingus resembling a Russian nesting doll from good wizards led by Nicolas Cage (punching way above his average). The outcome of the struggle depends on Jay Baruchel whos got Daniel Radcliffe beat for nerdy charm playing an untried young conjurer who must learn to believe in his powers. The tone is both goofier and darker than the Potter pictures and some of the magic battles built around New York City landmarks are eye-popping; theres also a genuinely affecting romance between Baruchel and fetching newcomer Teresa Palmer.

A time-spanning epic about a kid with superpowers who must overcome bad wizards from ancient times and all places Jerry Bruckheimers production of The Sorcerers Apprentice has a surface sheen and hurtling pace woefully lacking in Airbender. And whereas viewers of the recent M. Night Shyambles hoping to see their favorite A-listers slumming had to make do with The Daily Shows resident Islamic correspondent Aasif Mandvi in a serious role that was impossible to take seriously Apprentice has Nicolas Cage in subdued-nutsy mode and all-purpose overactor Alfred Molina in full hissable majesty. The main story takes a while to get going since Bruckheimers quintet of credited screenwriters (plus more rewriters probably than Despicable Mes Gru has minions) starts the action with two long prefatory scenes. The first takes place 1500 years ago in the days of King Arthur when the evil witch Morgana (Alice Krige) casts a spell on lovely Veronica (Monica Bellucci) and two young wizards Balthazar the good (Cage) and Horvath the snooty (Molina). Flash-forward to New York City a decade ago where Dave (Jake Cherry who played Ben Stillers son in the two Night at the Museum movies) a nerdy but adorable 10-year-old is led into the Arcana Cabana an old curiosity shop run by Balthazar. The ageless magus detects a certain star quality in Dave the boy may actually be ""the prime Merlinian"" which apparently means something. Summoning a portentous voice and a straight face Cage proclaims ""I am Balthazar Blake sorcerer of the 777th degree and you are my apprentice."" Cue a fight between Balthazar and Horvath. Cut finally to the present ...(See TIMEs 2010 summer entertainment preview.) ... where Dave (Jay Baruchel) now 20 is a physics major at NYU and the occupant of a gargantuan underground laboratory that most Manhattanites would pay millions for. Here he performs experiments with Tesla coils; here he will become Balthazars apprentice (Cage has the same mentoring function in this film as he did in the much more daring and entertaining Kick-Ass) and realize his destiny to you know save the world from Morgana and Horvaths evil. Why you might ask are these forces are never harnessed to find Osama bin Laden or regulate the banks? Because its a movie. (Read TIMEs review of Kick-Ass.) I have another question posed out of befuddlement not hostility Why is Jay Baruchel in show business? The 28-year-old Canadian rose from subsidiary slacker in Knocked Up to the male lead in Shes Out of My League and the voice of the boy hero in How to Train Your Dragon. Yet if he has big-screen charm or a gift for inhabiting characters or delivering lines Im missing it. In Apprentice his Dave is so outplayed by Cherrys 10-year-old version that I kept wishing for flashbacks. There are plenty of other young actors (paging Anton Yelchin) whod give life zest and watchability to the roles Baruchel gets. Is there an industry rule that he has to be constantly employed the way every Republican Administration from Nixons to George W. Bushs felt compelled to keep hiring Donald Rumsfeld? Hollywood please get back to me on this. Set (and partially shot) in New York City Apprentice makes lavish if uninspired use of such local monuments as a Chrysler Building Art Deco eagle and the Wall Street bull. Director Jon Turteltaub who led Cage through his National Treasure exertions also stages a scene that reprises the Mickey Mouse ""Sorcerers Apprentice"" sequence (music by Paul Dukas) from Walt Disneys Fantasia -- though this movie has about as much to do with that 1940 classic as Bruckheimers Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy did with the Disneyland Pirates ride. And despite the wizards ability to fly theres a car chase -- mandatory for virtually all Bruckheimer films -- in which Horvath instantly transforms Balthazars Mercedes into a Pinto. Plasma balls fly Tesla coils sparkle; the whole movie lights up like the ornaments on a plastic Christmas tree. Cage whose mopey weirdness retains its fascination earns another paycheck to help defray his multitude of tax liens. Does that make this a good movie? Not really. But on a hot summer day a family trip to the movies can be either a time-filler or a time-waster. Apprentice honorably fits the second category --in recreational value somewhere between an afternoon on a San Diego beach and one at a Detroit public swimming pool. Either way before you know it its evening. See the top 10 movie franchises that wont die. See the 100 best films of all time.

Abbot Genser Nicolas Cage stars in ""The Sorcerers Apprentice."" (AP Photo/Disney Abbot Genser) Look its another wizard movie with demons magic spells and a young man with amazing powers. Do we really need another graft from the ""Harry Potter"" vine?Actually yes we do.""The Sorcerers Apprentice"" starring Nicolas Cage is a tamer tale of supernatural shenanigans that is far more appropriate for young children than the sometimes too-scary scenes from J.K. Rowlings stories. In this story Cage plays wizard Balthazar Blake who was one of three wizards trained by Merlin to fight the evil Morgana back in the Round Table days. Merlin died in the fight but Blake managed to trap Morgana and turncoat wizard Horvath (Alfred Molina) in an urn that he has kept hidden for centuries - until he can find the ""Prime Merlinian"" the super wizard who will have the power to kill Morgana. Blake finds his special someone in the present day in the physics department at New York University. There the affable but nerdy Dave - the consistently good Jay Baruchel of ""Tropic Thunder"" and ""Shes Out of My League"" - is researching Tesla coils and trying to impress cute girl Becky (Teresa Palmer). He has no taste or talent for becoming a demon fighter. But after Blakes coaching and coaxing the two men set out to rid the world of evil once and for all.Cage and Molina deliver solid performances but it is somewhat disappointing that the role given to the talented and beautiful Monica Bellucci the third wizard and Blakes true love is nothing more than a cameo. Sure this is a predictable story from the Disney studio bloodless fantasy violence; chaste love story; no foul language; nerdy kid becomes a hero; good triumphs over evil; and everyone lives happily ever after.If a couple of adults are looking for mature movie enjoyment this can be a disappointing recipe. But if you want a fun fast-paced film that can be enjoyed by all ages it cooks up just right. Movie reviews If you go The Sorcerers Apprentice Jul 13 2010 (...)

"Movie Review The Sorcerers Apprentice - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Nicolas Cage Movie Review The Sorcerers ApprenticeJuly 14 2010|By Roger Moore Orlando Sentinel Movie CriticFive names are credited with writing The Sorcerers Apprentice the latest Disney offering from the National Treasure team of star Nicolas Cage producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Jon Turteltaub. And lets just say these five saw Bruckheimer et. al. coming. A generally joyless pastiche of sorcery history imitation Potter ""chosen one"" Messianics and mirthless silliness its another in a string of recent black marks against Cages Oscar-owning reputation. But at least its a family friendly mess. Nary a drop of blood in the violence barely a mild oath in the profanity department. We meet Balthazar (Cage) just as things are unraveling among the disciples of Merlin in eighth century England. The evil Morgana (Alice Krige) has killed the old wizard. But she and her pal Horvath (Alfred Molina) have been entombed in a magical nesting doll. Balthazar is condemned to wander through the ages seeking ""the Prime Merlinium"" aka that ""chosen one"" of ancient lore. OK only James Cameron can get away with naming something that stupidly. ""Unobtanium?"" Meet ""Prime Merlinium."" A New York nerd a social outsider since childhood is the guy who can wear Merlins green dragon ring. Balthazar discovers Dave Stutler (Jay Baruchel). The ring (a pretty cool dragon-curls-around-his-finger effect) fits. And the kid a physics nerd who builds Tesla coils in his spare time becomes Balthazars apprentice where all his questions are answered. ""Is sorcery science or magic?"" ""Yes and yes"" The kid wants to pursue the girl of his dreams (Teresa Palmer) but he needs to learn to hurl plasma balls and cast spells. And quickly. Theres evil (Horvath) afoot. One very clever if a tad too obvious scene. Our ""sorcerers apprentice"" needs to clean up the lab where his experiments and Balthazars training goes on. Elemental witchcraft? Get the mops and sponges to do the work just like Mickey Mouse in Fantasia. On the whole though this is a tedious exercise a movie that doesnt give Baruchel or Cage a chance to show the sort of wit that should have been the first thing those five different writers should have shoved into this commissioned script. Daves favorite punchline is the limp ""No Waaaay"" Even that villains villain Molina cant find the fun. Its all about the fanciful effects -- a liquid carpet that traps the unsuspecting? A ""Persian Quick-rug."" That doesnt do it for you? Well ""Its been a while since Ive used the Hungarian mirror trap"" That soulless effects-centric approach means that whatever the visual delights of The Sorcerers Apprentice this is still a Mickey Mouse action movie and an utterly disposable one at that. See for yourself The Sorcerers Apprentice Cast Nicolas Cage Jay Baruchel Alfred Molina Theresa Palmer Alice Krige Monica Belluci Director Jon Turteltaub Running time 1 hour 45 minutes Industry Rating PG for fantasy action violence some mild rude humor and brief language.

"Sorcerers Apprentice The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; sorcerer-s-apprentice-the ) Sorcerers Apprentice The (United States 2010) July 14 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Perhaps it takes a movie like The Sorcerers Apprentice to make one appreciate the level of creativity evident in the Harry Potter series. Distilled to their bare essences both stories are remarkably similar a modern-day kid discovers he has magical powers learns from an established wizard how to use them and must fulfill his destiny of saving the world from an evil sorcerer of great power. But a premise is only a starting point and The Sorcerers Apprentice quickly diverges from the path chosen by J.K. Rowling. The new Disney film is a mediocre exercise in plotting by numbers and proves (as if proof was necessary) that a lot more goes into crafting a compelling fantasy epic than spells and dragons. The Sorcerers Apprentice may enchant a certain demographic but that group is likely to be limited (pre-teen boys). The movie isnt so much bad as it is formulaic and uninspired. In some ways that might almost be a worse sin. The best part may be the prologue which tells of the fall of Arthurs Merlin at the hands of Morgana (Alice Krige). Before dying the great wizard bestows his knowledge upon his three disciples Balthazar (Nicolas Cage) Veronica (Monica Bellucci) and Horvarth (Alfred Molina). But Horvarth after being spurned by Veronica for Balthazar throws in his lot with Morgana. Balthazar manages to capture the spirits of Horvarth and Morgana in a doll but at great cost - Veronica becomes trapped with them. Over the centuries he seeks for Merlins successor until coincidence brings them together in New York City. At their first meeting Dave (Jay Baruchel) is only nine. Ten years later when Balthazar returns to teach him the magic he will need to survive confrontations with Horvarth and Morgana Dave is nineteen and more interested in pursuing Becky (Teresa Palmer) the girl of his dreams than in hanging out with a 1000-year-old sorcerer who tosses around fireballs lightning bolts and plasma globes. But Morgana is coming to destroy the world so Dave has little choice in the matter. The biggest problem with The Sorcerers Apprentice is its complete and utter predictability. Only a few minutes into the production its possible to guess with uncanny accuracy not only how the story will end but pretty much every step the plot will take to get us from the opening credits to the closing counterparts. Although its true that good almost always triumphs over evil in fantasy movies of this sort its depressing to realize there will be no surprises along the way. The word ""spoiler"" doesnt really apply to something like The Sorcerers Apprentice since this movie is nothing more than a patchwork assemblage of fantasy staples tossed together with a throw-away action scene or two (theres an unremarkable car chase) sit-com quality jokes and a lame teenage romance. But maybe its the predictability that gives something like The Sorcerers Apprentice its dubious charm. After all you can hold a knowledgeable conversation about it (if there was ever a reason to do so) without having seen it. For those who want to see the movie there are few things to enjoy. First and foremost is the performance of Alfred Molina who despite making The Sorcerers Apprentice for the paycheck exhibits his professionalism by giving a portrayal that is equal parts dastardly villainy and acerbic wit. Molina is not the only high-profile talent slumming here Nicolas Cage who has a history with director Jon Turteltaub (National Treasure National Treasure 2) and Monica Bellucci have joined the gravy train. Less impressive is Jay Burchel whos perfectly fine in light fare like Shes out of My League but lacks the range for something like this. When it comes to fantasy he should stick to voice work (he is the lead in How to Train Your Dragon). The films climax despite being as unsurprising as everything leading up to it is presented with enough energy to make it entertaining. Its all about special effects and they are displayed with the technical adeptness one expects from a Jerry Bruckheimer production. Theres also a rather strange homage to Fantasia in the middle of the film complete with dancing mops and brooms. I kept expecting to see Mickey Mouse make an appearance. (This is a Disney film but the only recognizable animated character to show up is Buzz Lightyear.) Its tough to come down hard on The Sorcerers Apprentice because its too inconsequential to be worth a thorough thrashing. A few ten-year old boys will enjoy the pyrotechnics and the uncomplicated plot while the rest of us can either ignore the movie altogether or if forced to play chaperone to an eager member of the target demographic sleep through it and not miss a thing.

In other words Lets do a movie that makes the National Treasure films look sophisticated. You may think that Im about to sneer but I found the ticky-tacky hocus-pocus foolishness of The Sorcerers Apprentice appealing in a turn-off-your-frontal-lobes way. Watching the film you dont have to pretend to care about rescuing the Declaration of Independence and thats a relief. You do however have to like Jay Baruchel who might be described as the nerds nerd (or to put it a shade more charitably lord of the dweebs). He plays Dave a wayward NYU physics major chosen by fate to be ""the prime Merlinian"" -- a junior sorcerer whose destiny should he embrace it is to help a centuries-old wizard named Balthazar (Nicolas Cage). A protege of the mighty Merlin Balthazar is locked in battle over time with Merlins two other far nastier proteges. Baruchel has the skinny-faced eagerness of a hacker who lives on nutrition bars and Dr Pepper but his key trait is his voice which is so nasal and whiny and annoying he sounds like Wallace Shawn imitating Don Knotts. As Dave learns the ways of sorcery you either find Baruchel so pathetic that hes unbearable or you wind up rooting for him and I confess that he won me over. It helps that Cage in a long leather coat and ringlets that look good on him (for once) is at his most charismatic and that the CGI is spangly fun lots of light balls gathered in the palms of hands and a rampaging performance by the Wall Street bull sculpture. The Sorcerers Apprentice is too long and its ersatz magic but at least it casts an ersatz spell. B?

Jay Baruchel as his apprentice isnt ready for prime time.       Photo The title character in ""The Sorcerers Apprentice"" is played by Jay Baruchel and here things begin to go seriously astray. They dont ever stop. To say Baruchel is unready to be a leading man in a big-budget action adventure is an understatement. He has the posture of Mr. Burns the speaking style of Fran Drescher and the raw sexual urgency of Duckie in ""Pretty in Pink."" Its unclear whether he could hope to be the alpha waiter at your local Chuck E. Cheese. When the line ""Many evil spirits will be raised from the dead tonight"" needs to be uttered Baruchel is not your man. The story starts in 2000 when Dave (Jake Cherry) a 10-year-old schoolboy wanders into a magical Manhattan antique shop that just happens to be run by Balthazar (Nicolas Cage) an ancient sorcerer and acolyte of Merlin the magician. Balthazar is at perpetual war with associates of the witch Morgana whose most active henchman Horvath (Alfred Molina) has been locked with fellow baddies in an urn for 1000 years. Good-guy Balthazar has spent that period in search of the chosen sorcerer who can wear a dragon ring signifying the ability to kill off Morgana for good. PHOTOS APPRENTICE FILMING IN NY Naturally Dave is the chosen one (after 1000 years why doesnt Balthazar seem more excited by this?) although he comes to be taught that this first wild encounter with Balthazar is the hallucinatory product of a nervous breakdown. But he encounters the sorcerer again 10 years later while an NYU physics student. The university has furnished Dave (now played by Baruchel) with a deserted subway station/lair/laboratory for his experiments. The lab in turn makes an excellent place for Balthazar to teach him the sorcerers dark arts while the nasty (but natty) Horvath schemes to destroy his historic foe. Cage who wears Stevie Nicks wardrobe (and her hair -- and her eyeliner) and Molina (in a bowler) spend the movie getting all special-effectsy at each other in a pointless perpetual stalemate. Meanwhile in learning his magical powers Dave does the usual comedic bumbling expected of a novice. The film keeps moving but so does a housefly. Each scene brings an exasperating new display of some previously unshown trick which director Jon Turtletaub (""National Treasure"") evidently thinks is a clever way to pump up the stakes. The seeming inexhaustibility of the magical powers just makes the viewer feel cheated. Its how superheroes deal with their limitations that makes them interesting. Who would sit through a Batman movie if he suddenly developed a different supernatural skill every few minutes? Most of the battles amount to mere exchanges of pranks anyway. Horvath gets locked inside a mirror then the same thing happens to Balthazar in Times Square mainly because the FX team incorrectly thinks its exciting to see what the billboards would look like in mirror image. Dave and Balthazar keep wandering off to leave the other alone to face Horvath then returning in the nick of time. Each sorcerer can shape-shift into a different person; each can change his car into a different car; each can hurl flameballs called ""plasma bolts"" that turn out to be about as awesome as Sterno. Sidekicks come and go and Balthazar gets locked in an urn himself. This was the only part that genuinely had some fantasy value -- who hasnt wished Cage could be locked in a jar? For like ever? ""The Sorcerers Apprentice"" is a two-hour trailer explosion shape-shift chase wisecrack repeat. Its most amazing trick will be how it vanishes from your memory before the seat you vacate has stopped moving. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Dream team Read Next Dream team Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 41614 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 20841 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash 19221 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Review Sorcerers Apprentice fun not magic 1 / 3 Back to Gallery The Sorcerers Apprentice Fantasy action comedy. Directed by Jon Turteltaub. With Nicolas Cage Jay Baruchel Alfred Molina Teresa Palmer. (PG. 109 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The Sorcerers Apprentice"" boils down to ""The Karate Kid"" meets ""Harry Potter"" with maybe a dash of ""Ghostbusters"" to keep it interesting. Its a Disney film produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and you can easily assign every scene to one or the other. Starring a mercurial Nicolas Cage and uber-dork Jay Baruchel its an OK family-oriented comedy action blockbuster with jokes and special effects troweled on to bolster its not-terribly-fresh story of magic and mentoring. Cage with hippie hair and a black leather trench coat plays Balthazar Blake a denizen of modern-day Manhattan who was an apprentice to the great Merlin long ago. Balthazar is guardian of a Russian-doll-like container holding many evil wizards and his job is to make sure they dont get out. One of Balthazars fellow apprentices the dashing but embittered Horvath (Alfred Molina having a jolly time) would be tickled to see the world wiped out and will do anything to get the container. Balthazar meets decent but socially inept NYU physics student David (Baruchel) and recognizing the young mans special powers trains him as a sorcerer to help in the struggle. In a plot strand straight from Baruchels ""Shes Out of My League"" David is trying to impress a gorgeous fellow student (Teresa Palmer) who outside of movieland would have little use for a guy like him. Lots of wizardly fireballs are tossed as Balthazar tries to impart the tricks of the trade and a sense of confidence to slow learner David. The special effects are OK but not unique - wizards turn into and emerge from a grainy mist a la ""The Mummy"" - and the same goes for most of the magic the wizards employ. But director Jon Turteltaub pulls off a reasonably good car chase sequence and an entertaining Chinese New Year parade and in the ""Ghostbusters"" vein makes affectionate use of some Big Apple landmarks such as the Chrysler Building. Theres a nice tip of the hat to the Mickey Mouse ""Sorcerers Apprentice"" sequence in ""Fantasia"" with its out-of-control magical mops. On the other hand theres plenty of Bruckheimer overkill. This is Cages third collaboration with Turteltaub and Bruckheimer after the so-so but lucrative ""National Treasure"" and its sequel. The actor regularly referred to as ""fearless"" is capable of playing all over the map and here hes more the cut-loose guy of ""Bad Lieutenant Port of Call New Orleans"" than the relatively sober Academy Award winner. Thats good. Baruchel has something of a one-note role and its not the most well-written part in movie history but he wins us over and is a tolerable counterpoint to Cage.

"The Sorcerers Apprentice a Mickey Mouse effort | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Sorcerers Apprentice a Mickey Mouse effortTake a classic Disney cartoon --1940s Fantasia -- and turn it into a big feature film and you shouldnt be surprised when the result is rather Mickey Mouse.Nicolas Cage left and Jay Baruchel in The Sorcerers Apprentice.  (HANDOUT)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainment ReporterTues. July 13 2010The Sorcerers Apprentice(out of 4)Starring Nicolas Cage and Jay Baruchel. Directed by Jon Turteltaub. 109 minutes. At major theatres. PGTake a classic Disney cartoon --1940s Fantasia -- starring one of its most beloved icons and turn it into a big feature film with splashy special effects and you shouldnt be surprised when the result is rather Mickey Mouse.The first sign that The Sorcerers Apprentice is in trouble is a long tortuous prologue set in 740 A.D. which gleefully plunders the Camelot legend of Merlin the magician and his nemesis Morgana le Fay and introduces a sorcerer named Balthazar (Nicolas Cage).Article Continued BelowHe traps her in a Russian doll prison called the Grimhold and then searches throughout history for the one young apprentice with the power to destroy her forever.Fast forward to New York City in the near present where 10-year-old Dave wanders away from a class trip into a shop selling antique collectibles and esoterica where he encounters Balthazar who gives him a gaudy ring which shows the kid is the chosen one.A battle ensues between Balthazar and another old sorcerer named Maxim Horvath (Alfred Molina) who both become trapped in a large urn.Ten years later Dave (Jay Baruchel) is back in New York attending college and still mooning about the little girl he had a crush on back then (who by coincidence happens to be going to the same school). The two wizard genies are released from the bottle and the battle for the future of humanity is on.Cage who looks like he hasnt washed or combed his hair since the 8th century has nevertheless developed a fashion sense consisting of a cool black leather trench coat and accessories and a love for vintage cars in the interim. Too bad hes decided not to infuse the character of Balthazar with much of a personality mouthing his silly dialogue with a sense of detachment that makes one wonder if hes not contemplating more pressing concerns (such as his unpaid tax bill and a certain run-in with the IRS).That leaves the greater burden on young Baruchel as the apprentice to make this silly CGI-enhanced flick bearable. What can one say? Channelling a bit of John Cusack a trace of Christian Slater and a hint of Jerry Lewis (circa 1955) Baruchel is a somewhat appealing hero though he is more geek than leading man in his portrayal.""This is not happening. I taste sour in my mouth"" Dave bemoans at one point.The ever-reliable Molina has some tasty fun as the evil Horvath and there is a scene involving the sorcerers apprentice making a mess involving a lot of enchanted brooms which -- meant as a homage -- only serves to remind us that in the movie business nothing is sacred.The story takes a little too long to tell the special effects take precedence over the plot and the climax is as predictable as the hefty box office the film is likely to amass.The family fantasy reunites Cage with his National Treasure producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Jon Turteltaub which should produce some kind of onscreen alchemy.But sadly the real commodity missing from this sorcerers tale is a sense of magic.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

(Genser/AP) Joe Neumaier Wednesday July 14 2010 400 AM Title The Sorcerers Apprentice Ah now its clear why Nicolas Cage has chosen increasingly out-there roles the last few years. With ""The Sorcerers Apprentice"" - a frenetic overstuffed but imaginative fantasy especially for kids wishing a magic spell could get them out of high school - all is at last revealed Cage is the worlds most successful teenage boy.As the Oscar-winning actor has let his id out in recent movies its been successful for him (the hit ""National Treasure"" movies the recent redo of ""Bad Lieutenant"") and even better for fans of bad movies (""Ghost Rider"" ""Knowing"" ""Kick-Ass""). Cage wanted to play an Indiana Jones-like adventurer a Marvel Comics superhero with a flaming skull a Batman-ish vigilante and now a wizard. So he did damn the consequences.Like any William Shatner appearance a Cage performance is a thing unto itself. And ""Apprentices"" everything-plus-the-kitchen sink approach lets its stars excesses guide it. The irony is that Cage actually underplays for much of the movie but really thats the way to go when one is throwing energy orbs riding atop the Chrysler Buildings eagle ornaments and dealing with enough plot to choke Houdini.Cage plays Balthazar Blake who was a student of Merlin in 740 A.D. Blake was in love with another interning wizard Veronica (Monica Bellucci) though theyre betrayed by the nasty Maxim Horvath (Alfred Molina). Through several leaps of narrative gymnastics Veronica ends up possessed by Merlins nemesis Morgana and along with Horvath becomes imprisoned in a nesting doll for centuries.Blake cant free his love or defeat Morgana until he finds ""The Prime Merlinian"" a descendant of the Arthurian conjurer. After centuries of searching he finds him in - yup Tribeca - where 10-year-old Dave Stutler happens upon Blakes magic store and attracts a supernatural ring before accidentally freeing Horvath.But wait thats not all Additional spells (and plot) trap Blake and Horvath in an urn for 10 years. When theyre finally freed Dave (Jay Baruchel) now a nerdy NYU science student is Blakes only hope if hes to stop Horvaths plan to release Morgana raise the souls of evil dead sorcerers (""Morganians"") and destroy the world.If nearly every sentence in that plot recap sounds like it should be delivered at breakneck pace by a guy in a long cape thats because Cages ""National Treasure"" director Jon Turteltaub planned it that way. It gets exhausting and much of the dark New York-at-night visuals dont let us appreciate the spur-of-the-moment spells Blake and Horvath hurl at each other.What should have been a fizzy Disney brand-enhancer like ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" or ""Enchanted"" seems like ""The Haunted Mansion."" A scene that references the dancing-mop sequence in 1940s ""Fantasia"" from which this movie gets its title is a throwaway like most of the special effects.Except ... you never know when someones got a rabbit in their hat and Cages pointy fedora turns out to house a few surprises. He and Baruchel (""Shes Out of My League"") make a good team - odd and odder - each of them muttering nasally through clenched jaws.Molina doesnt do much but if a villain with a walking stick and bowler hat is your idea of evil hes your man (and Toby Kebell as Horvaths Criss Angel-like flunky is goofy fun). The hocus-pocus they pull is plentiful if not prize-winning. And New York really is a character - not quite as in ""Ghostbusters"" but thats what they were aiming at.That there are more misses than hits will matter only if youre above the legal age to drive. Sorcery Balthazar explains to Dave is part magic part science. And Nicolas Cage might add part not caring what the grownups say.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Sorcerers Apprentice 1/2 (out of four)Stars Nicolas Cage Jay Baruchel Alfred Molina Teresa Palmer Monica BellucciDirector Jon TurteltaubDistributor Walt Disney PicturesRating PG for fantasy action violence some mild rude humor and brief violenceRunning time 1 hour 51 minutesOpens Wednesday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The Sorcerers Apprentice is the opposite of alchemy. The movie is a clunky noisy contraption. Director Jon Turteltaub (National Treasure) piles on gadgets and devices in the hopes well be dazzled enough to miss the storys lack of coherence and charm. The disjointed plot is a melange of cliches with logic that feels conjured up on the spot. Magical legends are cobbled together as if by someone in Screenwriting 101. Or as is the case here by a half dozen writers seemingly at cross purposes. VIDEO Watch the trailer The story is not remotely fun or magical even in its interpretation of the iconic Fantasia scene in which brooms and mops clean solo multiplying and intensifying as they go. The prologue gives us a centuries-old glimpse of master sorcerer Merlin (James A. Stephens) battling mega-evil Morgana Le Fay (Alice Krige). Before he expires Merlin scrunches Morganas malicious essence into a nesting doll where she is doomed to remain until a magician potent enough can release her wicked powers. Cut to 2000 and an awkward 10-year-old boy named Dave (Jake Cherry) whose schoolboy existence is dominated by his infatuation with classmate Becky (Peyton List). Through a series of events he becomes embroiled in Merlins legacy. The overblown effects feel bombastic rather than spellbinding. The movie trots out a slew of familiar car chases and explosions from producer Jerry Bruckheimers overused arsenal but it does add something new to the mix -- the clunky and nonsensical phrase ""prime Merlinian"" is uttered a couple of dozen times. The rest of the wizardly back story is similarly ridiculous. The film comes courtesy of the unholy trinity responsible for the National Treasure movies Bruckheimer Turteltaub and star Nicolas Cage. Cage plays Balthazar Merlins protege and Daves magical mentor. His arch-nemesis Horvath (Alfred Molina) and lady love Veronica (Monica Bellucci) come and go amid gravity-defying fireballs. Balthazar meets his budding wizard apprentice when hes a moony bumbling boy and predicts hell be a great wizard someday. Young Dave grows into an even more gawky and besotted man played by Jay Baruchel. His character is so one-note -- and that note is so discordant -- that Dave comes off more like a collection of irritating mannerisms and tics than a believable human being. In Knocked Up (2007) and Tropic Thunder (2008) Baruchel made a distinct impression coming off a bit morose plenty goofy and inherently likable. But here his whiny voice grates as does Cages posturing. Cage stalks around in a long leather duster grandstanding for his protege trailing messy curls and looking more wannabe Goth rocker than magic man. Brainiac Dave a student at NYU gains confidence with the grown-up Becky (Teresa Palmer) when he learns hes imbued with special powers. Becky is helpless to resist his nasally charms. Apparently when it comes to romance geekery is offset by being the Prime Merlinian. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Standards Editor Brent Jones.

It goes something like this. Take a mainstream script - the hunt for missing treasure say - and cast it with an off-center actor to give the marshmallow some texture and edge.So it is with The Sorcerers Apprentice a hearty helping of movie comfort food the seventh collaboration between Bruckheimer and Mr. Live From Off-Center himself Nicolas Cage.Cage is Balthazar Merlins disciple who seeks the wizards direct descendant - ""the Prime Merlinean"" (no relation to Optimus Prime) - to help settle a 1300-year-old grudge match.Back in the Arthurian day Balthazar and Maxim Horvath (Alfred Molina) a fellow disciple both wooed sister disciple Veronica (Monica Bellucci). Balthazar won her heart. So the jilted Maxim joined forces with unscrupulous sorceress Morgana Le Fay (Alice Krige) to unleash hell on earth.Why would this battle between good and evil play out in contemporary Manhattan? It has something to do with the possibility that the Prime Merlinean is an NYU physics nerd the helium-voiced Dave Stutler (Jay Baruchel). And maybe with the fact that the souls of Merlins disciples are imprisoned inside vessels (nesting dolls amphoras) and are unsprung in New York.Stringy-haired bleary-eyed and genially unstrung Cages Balthazar resembles 1950s-era Howard Hughes in a cowhide trenchcoat. If Balthazar needs to get somewhere fast he saddles up a gargoyle on the Chrysler Building and brings it to life. Finally his performance is as generic as the special effects. Cage hasnt lost his edge. But here hes PG not edgy.Baruchel the wiry shock-haired actor of Shes Out of My League charms in the title role putting his own spin on perfunctory dialogue. His eyebrows look like twin question marks lending him a comically quizzical look that translates ""Am I really expected to do a live-action version of Mickey Mouses dance with the overzealous brooms from Fantasia?""The answer is yes. Baruchels Dave has a hot date with the obligatory Bruckheimer blonde Becky (Teresa Palmer) and needs to tidy his squalid laboratory/apartment before she arrives. So he uses his newly discovered powers to order the brooms to do the dishes and floors.Like the rest of The Sorcerers Apprentice this sequence is familiar and mildly amusing. It also serves to justify the films title. In its part and on the whole the movie is more Cheez Whiz than wizardly.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

"Sorcerers Apprentice review This Sorcerer lacks magic |       NJ.com comments Sorcerers Apprentice review This Sorcerer lacks magic Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on July 14 2010 at 830 AM updated July 16 2010 at 713 AM View/Post Comments DISNEYNicolas Cage left and Alfred Molina star in the special-effects heavy The Sorcereras Apprentice which opens today. Action-movie mogul Jerry Bruckheimers few kiddie films include such wince-worthy mishaps as the rodents-in-space ""G Force"" and the down-under blunder ""Kangaroo Jack."" And the idea of the wildly wonderfully erratic Nicolas Cage starring in a family film as an avuncular wizard? That sounds about as not-ready-for-storytime as the Christopher Walken Puppet Show. So what exactly is the reason behind their joining Disney for the spell-casting ""The Sorcerers Apprentice""? The magic of marketing I think. And money. The Mouse Factory still has dibs on that pre-sold title thanks to Mickeys sequence from ""Fantasia."" The lucrative childrens market is the only one in which the ambitious Bruckheimer hasnt made real inroads. As for Cage -- well the man has bills to pay. So I guess for the folks involved this project makes sense. But the movie doesnt. It doesnt have a script that draws us in or characters we care about. Its a mere jumble of special effects hoping to catch kids searching for a quick summer substitute for ""Harry Potter."" They should keep looking. Movie Review The Sorcerers Apprentice Directed by Jon Turteltaub. With Nicolas Cage Alfred Molina Jay Baruchel. Now playing in New Jersey. (PG) Disney (112 min.) Ratings note The film contains violence. Stephen Whittys review TWO STARS The film starts with a lets-storm-the-castle sequence with dark forces invading Camelot and all the actors playing ham-a-lot. Merlin fatally stabbed entrusts his legacy to apprentice Balthazar. Balthazar meanwhile entraps the evil Morgana Le Fay in a matryoshka. And what exactly is a Russian nesting doll doing in ninth-century Britannia you ask? Hey youve got me. Im still trying to figure out where Balthazar got that expensive hair weave. Or why Veronica the love of his life has a modern Italian accent. Or why -- once we finally end up in the 21st century -- the villains include a 1000-year-old wizard in 19th-century clothes and a Chinese magician with blue eyes. Or who exactly this movie was made for. The college-age characters are way too old for a grade-school audience to identify with. The sword-and-sorcery shenanigans are far too silly to intrigue anyone beyond fifth grade. The special effects are mostly on the level of actors cocking an eyebrow and then hurling balls of blue flame at each other. Of course this being a Jerry Bruckheimer movie theres also a slam-bang car chase through a crowded downtown -- not because wizards would need cars but because this is a Jerry Bruckheimer movie. And since Nic Cage is involved there are a few strange jazzy passages when he suddenly emphasizes words for NO reason AT all. And action scenes when he jumps through the air in slow-motion his extensions rippling in the breeze. And -- verily -- both liven up the movie a bit. But Jay Baruchel as Cages modern-day apprentice looks like a woeful wolverine. The way-too-pretty-for-him Teresa Palmer has less depth than Barbie in ""Toy Story 3."" And the one scene that actually evokes the original ""Sorcerers Apprentice"" is unfunny and forced. The whole thing ends in a flurry of fire and magical spells. The most diabolical curse of all of course is the threat of a sequel.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Theres no magic to speak of in ""The Sorcerers Apprentice. I mean theres the stuff that happens when an effects crew works to provide the impression of magic. At least once Nicolas Cage waves his arms and Alfred Molina goes flying across a bathroom (why do so many action sequences involve urinals?) and the Merrill Lynch bull statue stampedes around Wall Street. (Hey who said ""Jumanji?)But a movie in which spells are cast is not the same as a movie that casts a spell. To be fair the sight of Monica Bellucci swaying and chanting mumbo jumbo on a fountain near Battery Park is a little hypnotic. Whats she doing here? What really is this movie doing here? ""The Sorcerers Apprentice  is a flavorless family-friendly action-adventure that doubles as memory exploitation. It has nothing to do with either the Mickey Mouse broom sequence of the same name from 1940s ""Fantasia or the 213-year-old Goethe poem that inspired it.""Fantasia  and ""The Sorcerers Apprentice  both belong to Disney which tries to justify the latter movie by tossing in a quick homage to the former. This time the broom sequence stars a bunch of mops. It feels cynical despite being the only interesting thing in the movie. The three credited screenwriters -- Matt Lopez Doug Miro and Carlo Bernard -- plunder Arthurian legend for the rest of the story.Balthazar (Cage) fights to save mankind (or Manhattan) from Horvath (Molina) who wants to destroy it. Apparently theyve been at this for centuries ever since their days as Merlins underlings. A coup against Merlin left Balthazars lady Veronica (Bellucci) trapped in an extra-strength nesting doll called the grimhold sharing a body with Morgana le Fay (Alice Krige). Veronicas liberation depends on the discovery of an enchanted being called the Prime Merlinian presumably because the Last Airbender was taken. If freed Morgana plans to gather an evil army to destroy the world. Her frivolous plans to raise the dead around the area of ground zero is almost beyond the pale.In any case Balthazars millennium-long search turns up a prime candidate in an NYU physics nerd named Dave (Jay Baruchel). The movie turns into a training-session picture that the makers of the current more entertaining ""Karate Kid wouldnt be wrong to find actionable They copied first. ""The Sorcerers Apprentice does have its own licks of inspiration. Balthazar rides one of the Chrysler Building eagles and Dave seems momentarily curious about the intersection of science and magic. But the movie is essentially just a series of generic magic fights and car chases interrupted by Daves improbable pursuit of a blond classmate (Teresa Palmer) who hosts a wimp-rock radio show and fulfills casting-call requirements for Kristen Stewarts sullenness with Zooey Deschanels whatever. This is romantic-comic ground better left to CBSs ""The Big Bang Theory.""The Sorcerers Apprentice is less than the shows movies and products it seems like. At some point the hunt for that nesting doll and the demolition of its contents foretells a video game (it arrives in stores today) and might induce longing in some for the Idiots Guide to American History found in those ""National Treasure movies.They were made by the same people responsible for this one -- the director Jon Turteltaub the producer Jerry Bruckheimer and of course Cage who almost makes the movie worth enduring. He plays the part with just enough characteristic slightly crazed vigor that you keep waiting to discover that hes just an escapee from the Disney mental ward. The outfit alone suggests dubious mental health. He wears a wig of blond curls and a leather duster. To my eyes he looked like hed just won the lead in ""The Nickelback Story. But for the kids who cheered in the audience Cage was a happier sight. He probably seemed like a substitute teacher from Hogwarts.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

The Sorcerers Apprentice Bad to fair Director Jon Turteltaub. Cast Nicolas Cage Jay Baruchel Alfred Molina. Rating Rated PG for fantasy action violence some mild rude humor and brief language. RELATED Qamp;A Sorcerer Nicolas Cage talks about magical role Men of movie magic Family fantasy films Nics (mostly) bad flicks Disney/Pixar movies Why is it never a strapping self-assured sort who simply takes it upon himself to do what he must for his fellow man? Sounds like it would make a pretty cool movie - if nothing else at least something different. Alas thats not the case with ""The Sorcerers Apprentice"" a by-the-numbers good-vs.-evil tale in which a scraggly sorcerer named Balthazar Blake (Nicolas Cage) must mentor Dave (Jay Baruchel) a nerdy college student so as to avoid the destruction of the planet. In happier news evil is represented by Alfred Molina in the form of Horvath a bad-guy sorcerer who takes great delight in his nefarious schemes. That would make another good movie - one where the bad guy who is more interesting actually wins. Though that whole end-of-days thing might be a tough sell for audiences. Whatever the case it doesnt matter no danger of anything unpredictable going on here. Enjoy Horvath while you can. Balthazar and Horvath have actually been around for centuries. They were disciples of Merlin (James A. Stephens) - yes that Merlin - but Horvath betrayed him siding with the evil Morgana Le Fay (Alice Krige). The bad guys get trapped in a large version of nesting dolls until a young Dave briefly unleashes Horvath. Balthazar is imprisoned inside the dolls for 10 years by which time Dave has grown into a full-on 20-year-old dweeb with a crush on Becky (Teresa Palmer) who is way out of his league. Or is she? Dave just might be the Prime Merlinean - the one person Balthazar has searched for through the centuries who can help him defeat Horvath Morgana the lot of them and avoid disaster. But first Balthazar must put Dave through his sorcerer-training paces for which Dave despite being a brilliant student shows little aptitude. Hes distracted by Becky for one thing and indeed despite misgivings Balthazar allows Dave a break in his save-the-world training to take her on a date. Sure take your time no pressure. It will all come down to a final battle of course and as with some of summers other climactic showdowns - in ""Iron Man 2"" for instance - its more whimper than bang. There are however some interesting bits and pieces in ""Apprentice."" One is the idea of magic as a form of science in which more of the brain is used - something sorcerers have a talent for. Another is Drake Stone (Toby Kebell) a sort of rock-and-roll magician who is an apprentice to Horvath who doesnt have much use for him or his Vegas-magic ways. No fair revealing what he says exactly but Drake does utter a hilarious throwaway line that is the single funniest and best thing in the movie. And there is a nod somewhat fleeting to the segment of ""Fantasia"" from which this film gets its name and presumably inspiration. Cage takes the role of Balthazar seriously - too much so for this type of film. Smile a little man. Baruchel proves again adept at playing the lovable loser but its Molina and Kebell who provide the film with what little spark it possesses. Funny that despite non-stop special effects sorcery and such ""The Sorcerers Apprentice"" cant quite overcome the key ingredient it lacks magic.

"The Sorcerers Apprentice A blend of magic and manic - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 2 1/2 starsThe Sorcerers Apprentice A blend of magic and manicApprentice conjures up near-constant chaosJuly 14 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticMy preteen son and I attended a screening of ""The Sorcerers Apprentice"" at a schmantzy new multiplex near downtown and heading out to the car afterward he observed that the only thing louder than the film was the supersonic hand dryer in the restroom. He enjoyed both for what I surmise was the same reason blasting functionality. This latest Disney live-action feature based a tiny little bit on the ""Sorcerers Apprentice"" segment in ""Fantasia"" and on Goethes poem before that isnt bad as these things go. Its more diverting than the ""National Treasure"" movies which like this one were produced by Jerry Bruckheimer were directed with aggressive impersonality by Jon Turteltaub and starred Nicolas Cage. In ""The Sorcerers Apprentice"" Cage swans around as Balthazar one of Merlins proteges a good sorcerer who can live forever and is trying to protect modern-day New York City and environs from the ravages of bad sorcerers played by Alfred Molina and Alice Krige. At one point he warns his physics-geek apprentice played by Jay Baruchel that if hes not careful Molinas character will turn him into ""a pig who looooves physics"" and on the word ""love"" Cage slips briefly into the character voice he gave the mole rat in ""G-Force."" Oscars are not won for such imperceptibly strange line readings. But perhaps they should be. The prologue which is chaotic enough to serve as an illustration on how not to do one of these prologues is in A.D. 740 setting up the conflict between Balthazar and his nemesis Horvath (Molina) who allies his dark forces with the Merlin killer Morgana (Krige). Flash-forward to 2000 when a 10-year-old boy encounters Balthazar during a school field trip. Ten years later young Dave is now conducting massive electricity and lightning experiments in his unauthorized abandoned-subway-turnaround laboratory as part of his New York University education. Once Balthazar presses him into apprenticeship Dave keeps his magic life a secret from the girl on whom hes been crushing since preadolescence played by Australian-born Teresa Palmer. The many-hands script exists largely to show Cage and Baruchel and Molina shooting fire-jets and balls of compressed energy at one anothers heads. The CGI is relentless and what you might call reverse-magical The more were hit with stuff the less wondrous it becomes. The action sequences involve Chinatown street-parade dragons coming to life the eagle on the Chrysler building doing the same and one spell and counter-spell and apocalyptic threat after another. My favorite thing in the film is the ""Hungarian mirror routine"" (I paraphrase) which means people and even cars can fly in and out of mirrors on the other side of which is Opposite World. Not a new idea that looking-glass topsy-turvy notion but a cinematically viable one. That its implementation comes amid a routine car chase is frustrating but given the Bruckheimer circumstances inevitable. mjphillipstribune.com 2 1/2 stars MPAA rating PG (for fantasy action violence some mild rude humor and brief language) Cast Nicolas Cage (Balthazar); Jay Baruchel (Dave); Alfred Molina (Horvath); Teresa Palmer (Becky); Toby Kebbell (Drake); Omar Benson Miller (Bennet); Monica Bellucci (Veronica); Alice Krige (Morgana) Credits Directed by Jon Turteltaub; written by Matt Lopez Doug Miro and Carlo Bernard; produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.

Nic Cage plays Balthazar Blake a 1300-year-old understudy of Merlin who finds his long-sought Chosen One in the unlikely form of a skinny NYU physics student Dave Stutler (Jay Baruchel) wholl have to cram magick lessons so as to help Balthazar stop a cabal of apocalyptic sorcerers all while courting a vanilla-indie college-radio DJ (Teresa Palmer). In Apprentices prologue a preteen Dave draws King Kong in marker on his schoolbus window so that it lines up to superimpose on the passing Empire State Building. This encapsulates the movies ""Presto"" playfulness with effects (""Its been a while since Ive seen the Hungarian mirror trick. . . . "") and the free way it has with New York City Daves massive Tesla coils fill his dungeon-lab an abandoned subway turnabout; a Chinatown New Years dragon the Wall Street bull and the stainless-steel eagles from the Chrysler Building all come to life. Cage will likely not earn a second Oscar here but he and director Jon Turteltaub (National Treasure) make leftovers into fine PG malarkey with their hokey naivete and prankish hocus-pocus.

A noisy f/x-spewing cauldron of a movie ""The Sorcerers Apprentice"" bears little resemblance to Disneys classic 1940 ""Fantasia"" segment much less Goethes original poem. The tale of a modern-day 20-year-old studying at the hands of an Arthurian wizard this visually overblown fantasy finds the Mouse House trying to spin another family-friendly tentpole from the ""National Treasure"" trio of producer Jerry Bruckheimer star Nicolas Cage and helmer Jon Turteltaub. Pic could charm the B.O. for a spell but like Disney/Bruckheimers other summer entry ""Prince of Persia The Sands of Time"" seems destined to work most of its magic overseas. A blur of opening exposition details the 740 A.D. clash between the great Merlin (James A. Stephens) and the evil Morgana Le Fay (Alice Krige) who is eventually trapped along with her followers in a Russian-doll-like container thats carefully guarded over the next several centuries by Merlins protege Balthazar (Cage also credited as an exec producer). Pic then jumps ahead to the year 2000 as dweeby 10-year-old Dave Stutler (Jake Cherry) is lured into a Manhattan curio shop. There he encounters Balthazar who predicts the boy will be a great wizard perhaps the great wizard -- a conclusion that seems all the more improbable when Dave clumsily unleashes Balthazars nemesis Horvath (Alfred Molina) from his magical imprisonment. This kicks off the first of many CG-laden combat sequences in which Turteltaub and his visual effects artists use hurtling fireballs and plasma blasts to systematically lay waste to the films sets. When the smoke clears Horvath and Balthazar have vanished and Dave unable to prove his crazy story to his peers becomes a local laughingstock. Ten years later Dave (now Jay Baruchel) is a physics student trying to forget the past and win over cute blonde coed Becky (Teresa Palmer) unaware that the warring wizards are about to make their return. As Horvath plots with punkish minion Drake (Toby Kebbell) to restore Morgana to full power Balthazar makes Dave his apprentice hoping to teach the gangly kid enough hocus pocus to save the world from destruction. This gloomy prospect doesnt seem to bother Dave whos generally less interested in casting spells than in spending time with Becky (Palmer sure is cute) a disconnect that proves crippling to the films dramatic involvement. The desire to be able to perform real magic is something almost every young kid can relate to at one point or another and the creative failure of ""Apprentice"" is that it never attempts to stir a childlike sense of wonder at the possibilities of the world before us nor to forge identification with Dave as he grasps his own otherworldly potential. The magic here feels machine-made and depressingly state-of-the-art; apart from the obligatory sequence paying homage to the symphonic poem made famous in ""Fantasia"" (complete with brooms buckets and Paul Dukas familiar music) its sole purpose is to deliver the sort of action-oriented pyrotechnic displays that will presumably dazzle an audience into submission. When Balthazar and Horvath engage in a car chase in supernaturally souped-up vehicles the lack of imagination on offer is genuinely dispiriting. There are glimmers of invention in the script (by Matt Lopez Doug Miro and Carlo Bernard from a story by Lawrence Konner Mark Rosenthal and Lopez) such as the intriguing notion that magic is merely a super-accelerated form of science that can be harnessed by those with sufficient brainpower. The teacher-apprentice bond is conceived along familiar believe-in-yourself lines and Cage and Baruchel both actors of essentially comic temperament arent given the quality of zingers that would elevate their characters relationship above half-hearted shtick or inspirational boilerplate. Staying within his geeky wisecracking comfort zone Baruchel seems to be channeling the sweet lovelorn loser he played in ""Shes Out of My League"" while Cage perhaps wisely avoiding the British accent his character rightly should have strides through the film wearing a trenchcoat and a look of unblinking lets-get-through-this concentration. Molina never a bad choice to play the villain delivers the most effective performance the gravelly menacing purr of his voice a natural complement to his dapper duds. Pic was shot in Gotham allowing for plenty of show-stopping visual highlights ranging from a colorful Chinatown parade to a showdown in Bowling Green; production design is nifty especially the underground lab/lair where Dave and Balthazar do their thing. Apart from the aforementioned sequence Dukas compositions are absent from Trevor Rabins standard score bearing out the impression of a ""Sorcerers Apprentice"" that has borrowed a title and a concept but little magic from its source.
