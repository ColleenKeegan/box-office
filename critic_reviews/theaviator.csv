He can hide behind its boyish affability the way Laurence Olivier hid behind putty noses and funny accents. In Catch Me If You Can DiCaprios face was a blank check on which his character forged a career in duplicity. At other times as in Gangs of New York a rage can pop out like a monster in a lake. His face is too soft to be a tabula rasa; it is a pillow on which DiCaprio can embroider surprising emotions. Thats why he is an actor a gifted one even more than he is a movie star. All this suits him to play Howard Hughes who was an enigma even more than he was a tycoon. A pampered rich kid Hughes made millions in the aviation and hotel industries. As Hollywoods longest resident outsider he directed the terrific aerial epic Hells Angels and produced two films that defined their genres for decades the newspaper comedy The Front Page and the gangster saga Scarface. When he wasnt flying planes and crashing them he was wooing glamour gals Katharine Hepburn and Ava Gardner. Best of all Hughes was a full-time eccentric who finally achieved a madness as bizarre as it was picturesque.

Martin Scorsese and screenwriter John Logan take a statelier approach retelling two decades of Hughes life in chronological order and trying to explain his degeneration with an eerily erotic scene of his mother washing the boy Howard and warning him of the dangers of pestilence. This penny-Freud thesis cant support the films nearly three ambling hours. Were happy to take the trip with Hughes but dont know how he reached Destination Crazy Hermit. While youngsters may wonder who Jean Harlow was (and whether she was as wan and angular as Gwen Stefani plays her) the Turner Classic Movies crowd will enjoy Cate Blanchetts high-pitched impersonation of Hepburn. If youre going to do Kate do her up grand lovey. Kate Beckinsale doesnt have the Gardner glow but her role is mainly nurse to Hughes as he spirals into loopiness. Scorsese movies always have a bounty of great scenes little miracles of kinesis and this one is no exception. Any time the film takes place in a plane it soars (one thrilling takeoff two amazing crashes). The Aviator has an opulence reminiscent of classic MGM. Theres also an efficient crackle to the postwar duel Hughes wages with a crafty Senator (Alan Alda). But this handsome movie is an oddly well-behaved one to come from the preternaturally energetic Scorsese. DiCaprio is ever plausible and watchable; he carries this big picture with grace. As for Scorsese he seems to have taken a cue from the DiCaprio facade fashioning a portrait of smooth surfaces and trusting DiCaprio to show whats inside. Well an actor can reveal meaning but he shouldnt be asked to invent it. Despite its stars heroic efforts The Aviator is a gorgeous jet flying on automatic pilot.

Hes a charming vulgarian a lanky Texas shark with a voracious appetite for fame fortune aviation beautiful women the picture business--and the sheer pleasure of speed. Scorsese channels Hughess hyperactive energy in his razzle-dazzle high-flying biopic his swooping restless camera and virtuoso editing inducing a contact high.But theres another side to Hughes--a streak of mental illness that stops this prince of perpetual motion in his tracks. An obsessive-compulsive with a lifelong phobia about germs Hughes goes into the mens room at the Coconut Grove to clean a food stain off his shirt and becomes paralyzed unable to exit because he cant bring himself to touch the doorknob and has to wait terrified and humiliated for someone to open it. When Hughes succumbs to bouts of madness the movie goes still as if stricken. ""The Aviator"" is built on these opposites motion and stasis a lust for life and a terror of it teeming scenes of action and the stark spectacle of a frozen paranoid man naked and alone in a room. Its a bipolar epic.Its been a long time since Scorseses made a movie this purely enjoyable. He revels in the glamour of old Hollywood the rich Technicolor palette of Robert Richardsons cinematography consciously evoking a bygone era of filmmaking. John Logans snappily written screenplay starts in 1927 when Hughes using his inherited fortune to break into the movie business begins filming ""Hells Angels."" He founds Hughes Airways; sets speed records flying planes of his own design; outrages the censors flaunting Jane Russells formidable cleavage in ""The Outlaw."" Best of all is his love affair with Katharine Hepburn played with lip-smacking vivacity by Cate Blanchett who captures her cocky insouciance to a T. In a cracklingly funny scene she takes the rough-edged Hughes to her familys Connecticut estate for a combustible dinner-table clash between Yankee snobbery and Texas bluntness. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Theres lots more in this long generous movie--Hughess public battles with Sen. Owen Brewster (Alan Alda) whos out to destroy him; his brush with death in a spectacular plane crash in Beverly Hills; an affair with Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale) and a power struggle with his arch rival Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin) the owner of Pan Am. And the movie takes us up only to 1947. Scorsese was wise not to cram Hughess entire life into one movie but he pays a price the wonderful parts dont quite add up. Were both surfeited and left wanting more. ""The Aviator"" is a movie-movie rendition of a larger-than-life man but real life doesnt allow it to have a movie-movie ending.DiCaprio is astonishing--wily impulsive paranoid lurching from manic highs to crippling lows. I couldnt imagine him in this part but after seeing the movie I cant imagine anyone else. Of course hes more boyish than the real guy less craggily masculine. It doesnt matter he suits Scorseses design perfectly. This is frankly a somewhat whitewashed portrait. Theres no mention of the mans racism and anti-Semitism his flings with his male employees (if Charles Highams biography is to be trusted) or the myriad others he used and discarded. This almost-great epic has one foot in legend its a vision of an American titan that could have sprung from the insides of Hughess own obsessive perfectionist head. Its an exhilarating--and sometimes chilling--place to be.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

The tycoon is presented - empathetically? - as an independent-minded American visionary this celebration of rugged individualism ends conveniently in 1947 with the (single) successful flight of his titanic Hercules nicknamed Spruce Goose and a courageous corrosively witty courtroom stand against corrupt Senator Brewster (Alan Alda gloriously venal); it never feels the need to broach the more notorious lunacies of later years. Yes Howies eccentric - arent all visionaries? - deaf and troubled but as incarnated by Leo DiCaprio hes also a cute charismatic all-round nice guy. Heck his capitalistic excesses mustve been just another example of his special genius like his passion for flight and his chat-up routines. This is Hughes as populist hero a twentieth-century pioneer. (A friend reckons its like Tucker which it is albeit rather darker.)Actually DiCaprios excellent gaining depth and subtlety as Hughes ages. One may question the wisdom of having Cate Blanchett mimic Kate Hepburn - though its a very good impersonation it means ones continually comparing it to the original instead of simply accepting her as a character as one does with Kate Beckinsales Ava Gardner - but the cast (which includes Alec Baldwin John C Reilly and Ian Holm) generally perform beautifully though mostly in minute roles. In terms of time space and impact its the leads film and hes far better here than in Gangs of New York. So is Scorsese coming into his own when his hero cracks steering the mise-en-scene into an expressionist register reminiscent of films by Michael Powell or Nick Ray. Theres some early Hawks Sternberg and Sirk in there too which suggests the richness of a visual/narrative style entirely in keeping with the subject. After all Hughes wasnt just about money planes and cleavages; he made movies too which clearly makes him okay in Martys book.

Hughes was severely injured but no one died. Movies Leonardos Flying Machine DiCaprio Becomes Howard Hughes in the Flashy but Shallow Aviator By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Saturday December 25 2004; Page C01 ""Picture people cannot get enough of Howard Hughes -- no matter the nagging suggestion from factual accounts that there was not a lot there."" So begins David Thomsons entry on Hughes in ""The New Biographical Dictionary of Film"" and its a pretty good description also of ""The Aviator"" Martin Scorseses three-hour movie entry on the same subject. Scorsese cant get enough of Hughes and he never convinces us theres a lot there. The movie is hugely entertaining in a very specific way. Its primary appeal is its speed It rushes along from scandal to air crash to movie romance to Senate hearing each anecdote well realized but never tarried over. Sound at all familiar? Those are the characteristics of the film Pauline Kael called a ""shallow masterpiece"" another bio of an American dynamo. That was the story of Charles Foster Kane in Orson Welless ""Citizen Kane"" which appears to be something of a touchstone for Scorsese. You could call ""The Aviator"" a ""shallow near-masterpiece."" Planes dames and cinema reels Leonardo DiCaprio embraces the many loves of the eccentric billionaire in ""The Aviator.""

The first and least substantial is a reliance on penny-dreadful Freudianism. Kane had his ""Rosebud"" Hughes his tin of soap. We will of course never know what ultimately broke Hughess mind but Scorsese hasnt thought deeply about it in any event. In his version a vague mother-figure forbidding as Agnes Moorhead in ""Kane"" makes young Howard fear the universe filling him with a debilitating paranoia symbolized by the childhood tin of soap he carries everywhere even as an adult. In Scorseses view the man grows up fearless and aggressive yet secretly fragile convinced of forces conspiring to destroy him (they were but not to the extent that he imagined); even in triumph Scorsese shows us the specter of mental destruction haunting him. Second and more to the point Scorsese captures Hughess dynamism exactly in the way that Welles captured the essence of Kane his variation on William Randolph Hearst. In both movies the heroic figure fills the screen dominating driving forcing the action. Thus a secret law of cinema as opposed to a public law of morality is in play In stories were drawn to the active character who may or may not be the moral character. Hughes may have been ruthless paranoid vengeful domineering but hes great fun to watch in action from the safety of the other side of the screen. In Leonardo DiCaprio Scorsese has found a perfect vessel to express Hughess abundant contradictions. His hair slicked back sporting one of those 40s-style flyboy mustaches DiCaprio looks enough like Hughes to pass the inevitable memory checks (something that destroys Kevin Spaceys upcoming spin as a lanky blond 45-year-old Bobby Darin). But its more than a trick of appearance its also quite an astonishing performance DiCaprio fills him with life. His Hughes is down-home Texas (the accent appears to be modeled on George W. Bushs) and he has a whip-crack mind for engineering. In fact to him everything is an engineering problem from the heft of Jane Russells breasts which had to be contained in a specially designed fabric application for ""The Outlaw"" to the planes he flew at the edge of (and sometime beyond) controllability to the political maneuverings in his fight as owner of TWA with Pan American for control of the nations overseas air routes. Only at the end and against great odds -- namely his own mental demons -- does he find the strength to step outside the engineering construct and triumph in a series of Senate hearings investigating his business practices by speaking directly to the American people. Did it happen? Hmmm probably not as the movie suggests as it overplays a ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" card. Hughes apparently won his combat with Sen. Owen Brewster Pan Ams designated Washington hit man by selectively leaking documents to columnist Drew Pearson. In other words Hughes didnt beat them by changing the game in Capraesque fashion he beat them by beating them at the game. But Scorsese loves Hughes the Legend and the movie vividly deploys the three big toys that sum up Hughess life hot airplanes mediocre movies and beautiful dames. It essentially stops in 1947 sparing us what Welles did not the spectacle of a tragic decline. Though Scorsese chronicles enough of the earlier breakdowns to suggest the coming darkness as well as creating eerie forebodings of it (some of them borrowed from ""A Beautiful Mind"" such as the appearance of characters real to Hughes that we realize might be fantasies). As for the airplanes its the best aviation movie since ""Pearl Harbor."" Hughes inherited a fortune after the death of a father whod invented a rock-cutting drill bit that became mandatory on all oil rigs and the wealth from Hughes Tool continued to pour in over the years -- much like Charles Foster Kanes inherited silver mine. Hughes took that dough and looked for ways to make it grow -- ways that kept him out of the office. Aviation was the Silicon Valley of the 20s and 30s; it was the age of the Heroic Pilot and it attracted the smartest and the best each trying to figure out a way to get a prop job over 400 miles an hour or to build a multi-engine comfortable enough and safe enough to haul passengers. Hughes like a cowboy Bill Gates played this game hard and well. The other Silicon Valley of 30s America was Hollywood where fortunes could be made or lost overnight and Hughes had to try that as well. He actually had a distinguished producing career at least for a while (""Scarface"" ""The Front Page"") which Scorsese ignores focusing instead on Hughess first giant picture ""Hells Angels."" That film combined all the toys Its a mediocre movie about planes (which he learned to fly in order to shoot much of the aviation footage himself) starring a tough-talking Kansas City dame named Jean Harlow (played briefly by Gwen Stefani) then 18. He clearly had an eye for talent -- or maybe just breasts. The planes the dames and the movies continue to intertwine throughout the 30s. He set a speed record at 351 mph in a prop job that was the first iteration of the low-winged streamlined monoplane that would knock the Messerschmitts and the Zeros from the sky. He set a global circumnavigation record. He crashed at least three times and the most terrifying of those -- in some kind of high-altitude reconnaissance number that resembled a P-38 Lightning on steroids -- is re-created in staggering detail. The plane chose to fall from the sky in downtown Beverly Hills and while Hughes barely survived -- multiple broken bones and massive third-degree burns -- several on the ground didnt. Meanwhile the engineer is also in and out of love bed marriages and friendships with Hollywoods most fabulous women. Cate Blanchett in buckteeth her tresses dyed red as Rudolphs nose makes a great Kate Hepburn. Again its that rare double She looks a lot like Hepburn so we dont blink in annoyance at the conceit. At the same time she captures Hepburns agile ironic mind her iron-maiden ways her goofy rich-socialist family (a great scene pits the glowering taciturn Howard against these raving self-dramatizing dilettantes). Kate Beckinsale has less luck with Ava Gardner because though quite beautiful she never looks enough like La Gardner to register as such. Or maybe its that Gardner huge in her day hasnt lingered in the mind and so Beckinsale has nothing to register as. Her Ava just seems like a tough smart beautiful woman who helps Howard by stewarding him through one of his early crackups in time to face Alan Aldas unctuous Owen Brewster. And then theres the movies. Of course the film sees in Hughess struggle to complete ""Hells Angels"" the microcosm of all his gifts and pathologies his will his courage his engineering genius his vision his craziness his taste for women with large breasts his insistence on doing it his own way even at the risk of business and personal ruin his gift for self-promotion and his absence of much to say that wasnt direct and empirical. But the movie also suggests the fluttery nature of his mind. He would lose interest in things and just more or less wander away. Hughes really disconnected from movies after ""Jet Pilot"" in 1957 and never made another one. The movie climaxes -- this is a curious choice -- in Hughess triumph before the Senate committee in 1947 over his seeming wartime profiteering and the scandal of the millions spent on his massive troop-carrying seaplane cruelly nicknamed ""The Spruce Goose"" which flew only once and never got as high as Scorseses computer graphics suggest. This is another devolution to genre Scorsese morphs from ""biopic"" into ""business picture"" choosing to climax in the fight between Hughess upstart TWA and old line Pan Am (headed by exec Juan Trippe played greasily by Alec Baldwin). Was this the best choice? Possibly not. Its hard in 2005 to invest emotionally in the conflict between two now-vanished corporate entities. Scorsese tries to finesse this by envisioning the antagonists as a little outsider (Hughes) vs. Ivy League old boy insider (Trippe) a populist fable that doesnt quite work with a figure as mythically wealthy powerful and mysterious as Hughes. The ending of such an action-driven story in such an uninteresting development pretty much leaves you cold. ""The Aviator"" is best regarded as a vehicle not a drama. It flies low and hard rattling the windows ripping up a cloud of dust maybe setting a speed record or two. Great glamorous fun but its moving so fast you dont notice some of the shortcuts and bad choices. The Aviator (169 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for air-crash violence and sexual innuendo.

So Id better write this in a hurry while I still think of Martin Scorseses production as a C-plus affair -- good enough to register what it means to do but not nearly adroit enough to pull it off. Heres what ""The Aviator"" means to do duplicate the elusive magic of ""Citizen Kane."" Instead of then-dashing Orson Welles (who was 25 at the time) as a fictionalized larger-than-life version of William Randolph Hearst Scorseses film has Leonardo DiCaprio (now 30 can you believe?) as a romantically impulsive Howard Hughes.

(This is between the 1920s and the late 1940s.) But hes heroic at every turn designing building and personally flying bigger and better aircraft and refusing to be intimidated by such powerful enemies as Hollywoods film censors MGMs Louis B. Mayer (Stanley DeSantis) Pan American Airways head Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin) and the demagogic Sen. Ralph Owen Brewster (Alan Alda) and hardly blinking an eye as his operating budgets rise by tens of millions. In ""Kane"" director Welles broke all the known ""rules"" of moviemaking in terms of editing camerawork lighting and you name it. For his pains the film became one of Americas true originals. And as the central figure Charles Foster Kane Welles was a powerful presence. ""The Aviator"" scripted by John Logan follows all the rules of Hollywood big stars promiscuous use of computer-generated imagery and more emphasis on advertising and publicity than story development. Theres a top-of-the-line emptiness about the whole thing. And even though DiCaprio does his gimlet-eyed damnedest to own this movie hes more energetic than charismatic. Hes not Howard Hughes whose heroin addiction bisexuality predatory taste for women dereliction and paranoia are either nowhere to be found or cutified for Best Picture respectability. (His frenzied hand-washing based on a lifelong fear of infection is given full throttle however.) He doesnt even seem like a grown-up despite his age. And that Texas accent seems to come and go. To be fair DiCaprio awakens in the final darker section. Without giving too much away theres an emotional conclusion that rings of Scorseses ""Raging Bull"" in terms of dark human texture. Its as if Scorsese suddenly remembers his earlier better films. But just as soon as we get to the good stuff poof the movie is done. (Be honest Arent we watching this to watch the guy completely lose it? Hughess demise reassures many of us that ridiculous wealth messes people up and shouldnt even be coveted.) Alda is memorably weaselly as the senator who starts an investigation into Hughess purported mismanagement of government funds for aircraft during the war years and Baldwin makes (as always) a wonderfully slimy opponent as Trippe. But as Katharine Hepburn one of several actresses who came into Hughess life Cate Blanchett is so wrongly cast its almost campily intriguing to watch her mannered failings. Kate Beckinsale who plays Ava Gardner (another Hughes lover) is bright and peppy but nothing more. The same goes for John C. Reilly as Hughes factotum Noah Dietrich whos essentially the movies head-shaker and note-taker. The best moments in ""The Aviator"" are the big set pieces with CGI effects such as Hughess first-time launching of the oversize flying boat the Spruce Goose out of Long Beach Harbor and a stunner of a crash landing in which Hughes jockey-rides a failing plane as it fish-bellies through a suburban neighborhood and makes an incendiary final stop. Unfortunately the gee-whiz aspect takes over the human story. We may enjoy watching the spectacles but we dont much care for or even have a feeling for the guy in the cockpit. THE AVIATOR (PG-13 169 minutes) -- Contains sexual scenes nudity obscenity and a gruesome crash landing. Opens Saturday. Area theaters.

(AP Photo/Miramax Films) In this undated promotional photo provided by Miramax actor Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Howard Hughes in a scene from Martin Scorseses ""The Aviator."" (AP Photo/Miramax Films) Scorseses Aviator is a sumptuous entertaining look at the life of Howard Hughes -- even if it doesnt have a point 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Aviator Drama. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio Cate Blanchett John C. Reilly and Alec Baldwin. Directed by Martin Scorsese. (PG-13. 169 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Whats required for enjoying ""The Aviator"" is an interest in Howard Hughes  or aviation or classic Hollywood or any combination of those three. Bring that and director Martin Scorsese takes care of the rest. His actors are well cast and their performances are flashy in the best way. The period detail is sumptuous. Scorsese places us in the world of 1930s Hollywood as though settling us into a stuffed chair and then keeps attending to us playing songs from the era in the correct style bringing out cigarette girls with the right haircuts and depicting with the ideal combination of faithfulness and imagination characters out of history. The only thing missing is a good answer to this question Excuse me Mr. Scorsese but why did you make a movie about Howard Hughes? If theres an answer besides ""Hes interesting"" or ""I thought it would be cool"" its not on the screen. Scorseses ""Raging Bull"" was a masterpiece because it was a lot more than the life of an obnoxious boxer. ""Kinsey"" inferior to ""The Aviator"" in almost every way nonetheless contained specific reasons for depicting that life which helped. In comparison ""The Aviator"" has a hole in its center and Scorsese fills it the only way he can with spectacle. He makes ""The Aviator"" colorful and entertaining from beginning to end. There are worse things. Hughes life provides plenty of opportunities for dramatic depiction. He produced and directed movies ran a studio set flying records and designed and built airplanes. Then he gave way to mental illness and lived his remaining years as a recluse. ""The Aviator"" focuses on his years of ambition innovation and accomplishment. We first meet him on the set of his film ""Hells Angels"" the World War I flying epic that took him years to make. At first glance Leonardo DiCaprio looks a little young to be playing Hughes but in fact hes on the mature side. Hughes started directing that film when he was 21. This is where a little previous interest or knowledge helps. Coming in cold it might be amusing to watch Hughes a young novice lavishing time and money on this risky venture. But if youve ever watched ""Hells Angels"" and the brilliant aerial sequences he created -- easily some of the best ever filmed -- its fascinating to see how he did it. For one thing ""The Aviator"" tells us he needed clouds. He observed that planes shot against a clear sky looked as though they were standing still even when they were moving quickly. They needed to be shot against clouds so as to convey their speed. The film smoothly navigates from one episode to the next in Hughes life with two things remaining constant his love of airplanes and the specter of mental illness. In a plane hes fearless but hes terrified of germs and eventually his phobia makes him a voluntary prisoner. We see it coming but more poignantly he sees it coming. In one of the films best scenes he confesses his fears to his girlfriend who just happens to be movie star Katharine Hepburn. Cate Blanchett plays Hepburn sauntering into the film as though she owns it as though this were ""The Katharine Hepburn Story"" which is exactly what Hepburn would do. When she does the film bursts into life. Blanchett adopts an audacious strategy for the role in that she flat-out imitates Hepburn and the first reaction is to laugh. But Blanchett also gets Hepburn and so we gradually come to accept her performance for the same reasons we accepted all those Hepburn performances because we give up under the relentless pounding and because we recognize the sensitive and noble spirit behind the relentlessness. As Hughes DiCaprio is nimble and appealing. If one wanted to concentrate long enough to find fault one could say that hes not quite believable as a man whos going crazy but whatever he does he makes us care that Hughes is going crazy and thats good enough. He also conveys in subtle ways the differences in aura energy and motion between a man at 21 and 40. Hes supported well by John C. Reilly as Hughes top accountant (and professional worrier) and Alec Baldwin as Juan Trippe the head of Pan Am and the chief competitor of Hughes TWA. Especially enjoyable are the two scenes between DiCaprio and Alan Alda who plays a corrupt senator. Kate Beckinsale doesnt get to do all that much as Ava Gardner but she does what shes called upon to do which is to convince us that Ava was one of the great broads of all time - - tough aware of her worth but also decent a loyal friend. As Jean Harlow who accompanies Hughes to the ""Hells Angels"" premiere Gwen Stefani has about three lines. She doesnt look or sound like Harlow but then any actress with Harlows charm would have had to be given a bigger part. The audience would expect it. -- Advisory This film contains sexual situations strong language and a plane-crash sequence.

RELATED  Martin Scorsese is still learning YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Coming Attractions Leonardo DiCaprio Martin Scorsese or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? (CNN) -- ""The Aviator"" is the perfect melding of talent and material. Who could be better than director Martin Scorsese to bring the story of Howard Hughes Hollywood years to the big screen? Scorsese is not only a certified genius in the art of filmmaking hes also one of the worlds foremost film historians.And who could be better than Leonardo DiCaprio one of the worlds most famous men to star as the much-talked-about Hughes? Together these two vastly talented men -- along with screenwriter John Logan and an utterly superb cast and crew -- have created a masterpiece.Most people think of Hughes as the eccentric billionaire hidden away in a hotel penthouse with a long white beard wearing tissue boxes as shoes and sporting grossly elongated fingernails. But rather than focusing on this image Scorsese Logan and DiCaprio decided to look at the most prolific period of Hughes life from the mid-1920s through the 1940s when he was a pioneer in two new industries that dominated the 20th century -- aviation and film.""The Aviator"" is framed by two major events in the life of Hughes his legendary entry into Hollywood filmmaking and his nasty public battles with U.S. Sen. Owen Brewster (played beautifully by Alan Alda) over the usefulness of the planes that Hughes Aircraft built for the U.S. military during World War II.As a young millionaire Hughes swept into Hollywood -- and motion picture history -- with the costly production of ""Hells Angels"" an epic World War I adventure featuring amazing aerial stunts using specially designed aircraft.""The Aviator"" then segues between Hughes sexually charged private life and his prolific and public professional life. His affairs with the strong-willed Katharine Hepburn played exquisitely by Cate Blanchett and the glamorous Ava Gardner brought back to life by Kate Beckinsale are included as well as his magnificent gambles with his life and fortune as he breaks numerous speed and distance records for airplanes (crashing a few along the way) and changes forever the design and manufacture of aircraft.This epic film also explores his fierce competition with Pan American Airways founder Juan Trippe superbly played by Alec Baldwin and his lifelong relationship with his right-hand man Noah Dietrich expertly performed by character actor John C. Reilly.This finely tuned script also gives us a look into Hughes emerging mental illness and how heartbreakingly aware he was of his phobias and the way in which they were forcing him to withdraw from the world only to fall headlong into madness later.DiCaprio is truly amazing in the role of a part inventor part showman. The actor commands the screen like never before in his realistic portrayal of one of the most complex deeply layered and ultimately tragically flawed men of the last century. DiCaprios performance is perfectly calibrated as he takes Hughes from the early years as a womanizing Hollywood mini-mogul to a man on the verge of mental and emotional darkness who appears before a Senate subcommittee fearlessly defending his wartime actions. It is without doubt an Oscar-worthy performance.The same can be said of Blanchetts portrayal of the late great Hepburn. She captures the independent spirit of the legendary actress as well as the cadence of her clipped Yankee speech without veering into outright mimicry. Blanchett is one of the best actresses working today and she is amassing an impressive body of work in a very short time.Scorsese has my vote for best director an honor that has eluded this cinematic master for far too many years. Nothing against Kevin Costner but it was a crime when his direction of ""Dances With Wolves"" topped Scorsese and ""GoodFellas"" for the 1990 Oscar.With ""The Aviators"" combination of digital technology classic lighting techniques and outstanding production design by Dante Ferretti Scorsese has captured the time period with astounding accuracy. The flying scenes are breathtaking and Robert Richardsons cinematography -- both in the air and on the ground -- is a thing of beauty. Ironically Scorsese is afraid of flying. But he obviously isnt afraid of filming it.The movies overall look is also worth noting. Scorsese has given the film the appearance of having been shot in the Technicolor format of Hughes day. The final result is like being swept back into the 30s and 40s while watching this exquisite motion picture unfold on screen.Hughes was larger than life and so are the talents of the people who made this film. ""The Aviator"" captures an extremely unique highly eccentric man and his amazing place in American history to visceral perfection.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

He later designed and crashed planes with equal flamboyance plus brainstormed the mechanics of Jane Russells full-figured bra for The Outlaw before he started to go mad. One fly guy Leonardo DiCaprio as the eccentric Howard Hughes in The Aviator. Miramax If youre thinking this is a story Martin Scorsese just might be able to do something with -- oh does he ever in The Aviator. But if youre thinking that Hughes doesnt sound like a role made for Leonardo DiCaprio youre as wrong as I was before seeing the film. Despite the films sporadic lulls both director and star are on full beam. The first and third hours of this 20th-century epic are as dazzling as big-scale movies get. Screenwriter John Logan wisely limits the action to a roughly two-decade time span the filming of 1930s bank-busting Hells Angels (just out on DVD) to Hughes getting airborne (once) in the Spruce Goose which was thought to be unflyable. With the full story -- Texas background ownership of RKO the famed Clifford Irving Hughes memoir hoax -- the movie would have had more problems with unwieldiness than Scorsese and DiCaprios Gangs of New York. The picture is still stuffed though not overstuffed. Hughes romances Katharine Hepburn deliciously played by Cate Blanchett in a performance broad enough to be a stitch but not so broad as to be a cartoon. About the movie The Aviator     (out of four) Stars Leonardo DiCaprio Cate Blanchett Kate Beckinsale Alec Baldwin Alan Alda John C. Reilly Ian Holm Directors Martin Scorsese Distributor Miramax Rated PG-13 for thematic elements sexual content nudity language and crash sequence. Opens in New York Los Angeles and San Francisco; wide Dec. 25 Later he takes up with Kate Beckinsales Ava Gardner -- the one performance that doesnt come off (though Beckinsale has the requisite beauty). On the guy front Hughes who ran TWA battles Pan Ams Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin) for a monopoly over the international skies. This leads to one of The Aviators two scenes that rank with the greatest in recent memory Hughes making mincemeat of Maine Sen. Ralph Owen Brewster (a never-better Alan Alda) at a congressional hearing on corruption in the awarding of World War II-era government contracts. The other hall-of-fame scene is the Beverly Hills plane crash that almost killed Hughes and probably exacerbated the dementia germophobia and gone-to-seed appearance of his final reclusive decades. Its spectacular in all senses but in this movie spectacle rules throughout. A magnificent DiCaprio fully captures Hughes drive and intensity yet also makes you see how before he went fully over the brink someone so impossible was also genuinely liked by so many. I wish Scorsese could have trimmed 10 or 15 minutes from the running time; overlength is the only thing that keeps The Aviator from being the years best movie. But even as it is its the years most exciting by a wide margin.

Inventive fabulously wealthy and addicted beyond reason to risk Hughes was a pioneer of our two most glamorous industries film and flying. He was an ambiguous public hero a private monster and finally a sad case which makes him a natural subject for the movies. Yet while Hughes has popped up as a character in other peoples fictions -- in Max Ophuls Caught in the James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever as Montgomery Burns on The Simpsons and in Jonathan Demmes Melvin and Howard -- until now no one has been able to bring a feature about Hughes to fruition. On paper at least Hughes is a perfect match for Martin Scorsese whose love affair with larger-than-life American deviants continues to fuel his career albeit with diminishing returns. Scorsese was hired to direct The Aviator by its star Leonardo DiCaprio and by producer Michael Mann who is not known for tiptoeing around a subject. Yet the movie is if not exactly chipper then maddeningly circumspect about a man who treated almost everyone he came into contact with horribly and ended his life naked filthy and barking mad. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - At nearly three hours long this lavish period spectacle gives great airplane and Hollywood revelry but pays no more than lip service to what drove the tortured inner world of a tycoon whose gift for unhappiness made William Randolph Hearst look downright jolly. Scorsese and his screenwriter John Logan have chopped off Hughes life at its most dramatic watershed when he began his downhill slide into reclusive paranoia and drug dependency. After Gladiator Star Trek Nemesis and The Last Samurai Logan seems an odd choice for a story as pregnant with contradictions as Hughes. The Aviator spans the two decades between 1927 and 1947 during which Hughes inherited a vast fortune from his fathers power-drill patent and spent great chunks of it on making his most acclaimed (Hells Angels) and reviled (The Outlaw) movies. He also bought and all but bankrupted RKO Radio Pictures frittered away millions on casinos and hotels in Las Vegas built and flew the worlds biggest airplanes and through his airline company TWA propelled the aviation industry into the jet age.Like many of Scorseses movies over the last decade The Aviator is a triumph of production design as cold and blue as DiCaprios eyes. Decked out to look like a Hollywood picture of the interwar period the movie offers spectacular set pieces of Hughes carousing at the glamorous Cocoanut Grove of the making of famous dogfight scenes in Hells Angels and most of all of Hughes erotic fingering of the gleaming lines of his planes the only true loves of his life. As a character study though The Aviator is downright squeamish skimming only the more palatable facts from the several informative biographies that exist of this increasingly secretive and paranoid man.By almost any measure Hughes had a malign childhood. His parents were strict and overprotective and it seems likely that he was seduced by a beloved uncle. The movie skates over his early years with a brief introductory moment in which Hughes mother as neurotic and racist a germophobe as her son would later become cups 7-year-old Howards face between her delicate hands and hisses into his ear ""Youre not safe."" It takes more than this to ruin a child We never learn what shaped Hughes into the man he became -- glamorous and charming but also cold manipulative and cruel especially to the countless women and men he slept with -- or into the ill-concealed anti-Semitism that proved less than an asset around the predominantly Jewish studio heads. Watching DiCaprios capable if vapid and dainty reading of Hughes I kept thinking how much more of a dynamic show wed have gotten from Johnny Depp Colin Farrell or better still the seasoned David Strathairn who would surely have given Hughes his dark due. DiCaprio renders Hughes as little more than a galloping case of obsessive-compulsive disorder furrowing his brow scrubbing his hands and desperately struggling to control his repetitive tics. The movie glides tactfully over his bisexuality now proven though Charles Highams hastily written and mostly hostile biography of Hughes improbably has him running into ""darkly handsome"" young men every few pages. Instead this compulsively unfaithful huckster -- like many rakes he was at best average in bed -- is painted as no more than a naughty boy in his relationships with Katharine Hepburn (a merely imitative Cate Blanchett horsy and cursing ""Hot Dawg"") and Ava Gardner (crisply played by Kate Beckinsale) both of whom remained his friends when the affairs had run their course.

Aug. 15 705pm The Aviator warms up in its last hour as Hughes begins to lose it rerunning Ava Gardner movies while sprawled naked in his red-paneled screening room with milk bottles of urine lined up in neat rows while friends and employees try in vain to coax him out. Desperate to retool Hughes as a great American hero Scorsese ends the movie with a victorious rebound in which he outmaneuvers a U.S. senator (Alan Alda) whos on the take from rival airline Pan Am and sends his gargantuan beautiful ridiculous flying boat the Spruce Goose on its first and last flight out of Long Beach Harbor.How perverse is it to give Howard Hughes an upbeat ending? That he was a visionary is certain but he was also a captain of crooked industry a faithless lover and friend who ended his life a broken man. Scorsese seems not to want to face up to this or what it says about the American way of doing business and taking pleasure. For all his wealth and power Hughes was a walking tragedy and theres more insight than any biopic can handle in Demmes wonderfully sweet and goofy Melvin and Howard which takes far more liberties -- and achieves a larger truth -- with a fact-based incident that occurred at the nadir of Hughes life. Wild-eyed and bearded as Nick Nolte on a bad day Hughes played by Jason Robards is picked up and treated kindly by a truck driver who subsequently finds himself a joint beneficiary of Hughes vast fortune in a will discovered in Salt Lake City after his death. In real life the will was thrown out of court but Demme with saving humor and compassion seizes on the encounter to throw the whole question of American winners and losers up in the air and watch it fall to the ground in smithereens. All his life Hughes seems to have felt like a loser in winners clothing. In leaving him a winner Scorsese may be acting like a true American but hes not necessarily acting as a true artist.THE AVIATOR | Directed by MARTIN SCORSESE | Written by JOHN LOGAN Produced by LEONARDO DiCAPRIO MICHAEL MANN SANDY CLIMAN GRAHAM KING and CHARLES EVANS JR. | Released by Warner Bros.

"Aviator The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; aviator-the ) Aviator The (United States/Japan 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli Had Martin Scorsese made this film 25 years ago it would have been greeted with a surge of curiosity. Howard Hughes one of the richest eccentrics of the 20th century was still fresh in the publics mind at that time. Now more than a quarter century after his death his memory has faded like an old photograph. With The Aviator Scorseses aim is not to resurrect the paranoid recluse who hid from photographers and the public during the last 20 years of his life but to show a younger more vital businessman and adventurer whose battles with an obsessive-compulsive disorder foreshadowed his late-life mental deterioration. The Aviator is a good but not great filmed biography and continues Scorseses recent flirtation with mediocrity. Since Casino there has been a distinct lack of energy and creative drive in the master directors movies. Kun-Dun Bringing Out the Dead Gangs of New York and now The Aviator have all been respectable efforts but they are in the minor leagues when compared to Taxi Driver Raging Bull and Goodfellas. It is unfair to expect Scorsese to fashion a masterpiece every time out but this is an unusually long dry spell. One could make the argument that he needs once again to team with Robert De Niro. For now however it appears that Leonardo DiCaprio has replaced De Niro as Scorseses leading man. DiCaprio not only headlines Gangs of New York and The Aviator but he has been picked to star in the directors next movie (The Departed). The Aviator skims across roughly two decades in Hughes life from the late 1920s until the late 1940s. The film opens with the millionaire sinking huge sums of money into his Hollywood dream epic Hells Angels (which would garner him more critical and public acclaim than anything else he did in the movie business). It ends with his getting the ""Spruce Goose"" an aircraft capable of carrying 700 people into the air despite a 320-foot wingspan and a 400000-pound weight. In between he makes more movies become the primary stock holder in TWA is nearly killed while test piloting the XF-11 spy plane sets various aviation records and enters into pitched battles with Maine Senator Ralph Owen Brewster (Alan Alda) and Pan-Am president Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin). The movie also details to one degree of another some of Hughes most publicized romances. The one that is presented best is his dalliance with Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) which is depicted from witty beginning to acrimonious end (when she leaves Hughes for Spencer Tracy). Less satisfying glimpses are provided of his liaisons with actresses Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale) and Faith Domergue (Kelli Garner). The Aviator also spends perhaps too much time showing Hughes battles with OCD and other mental disorders including a lengthy sequence in which he is sitting naked in a ""germ-free"" zone watching movies. Historically The Aviator is probably the most accurate of any of the recent flood of bio-pics. Unlike Ray Beyond the Sea and even (to a lesser extent) Kinsey the film does not attempt to soft-peddle the central characters faults or lionize him. That may have to do with perspective. Since Scorsese and screenwriter John Logan (Gladiator Star Trek Nemesis) have no emotional investment in Hughes story they are able to present a more balanced view of the subject. Unfortunately The Aviator suffers from the problem facing nearly all movies that span long periods a scattershot episodic approach. We feel that were watching highlights from Hughes life rather than a seamless story. The Aviators first of three hours is engrossing. After exploring the tribulations faced by Hughes in making the most expensive motion picture to-date (3.8 million) it moves on to chronicle his romance with Hepburn. Cate Blanchetts whirlwind performance easily the best by a supporting actress this year enlivens the film for about 40 minutes. She energizes The Aviator and were hardly aware of the passage of time. Then shes gone and theres still more than 90 minutes of footage to wade through. The second half of the film is unevenly paced and has a tendency to drag although proceedings are enlivened by a terrifying plane crash. Story-wise there are also some missteps (although these could be the result of cuts made to reduce the running length). Hughes affairs with Ava Gardner and Faith Domergue are poorly developed and Gardners ""rescue"" of Hughes from a mental sinkhole is badly motivated and not credible. As Hughes Leonardo DiCaprio is usually solid but rarely a stand-out. That distinction rests with Blanchett. DiCaprio has a tendency to overact when presenting the characters mental turmoil. (Compare his work here to Russell Crowes in A Beautiful Mind.) Most of the supporting cast is solid with nice turns by Alec Baldwin Alan Alda and John C. Reilly. Cameos include Gwen Stefani Brent Spiner Willem DaFoe and Jude Law. But there is one horrible example of mis-casting Kate Beckinsale. Although the British actress bears a passing physical resemblance to Gardner her performance is a black hole. She brings nothing to the role sleepwalking her way through a part that should have had a lot more heat. The fact that she essentially replaces Cate Blanchett (filling the romantic void left when Hepburn moved on to Tracy) makes her inadequacy all the more apparent. Its as if her recent immersion in vampire movies has sucked out Beckinsales life. And its unusual for a Scorsese movie to have such a bad ""miss"" in a role. Even if the subject had more appeal to mainstream audiences the nearly three-hour length would cap the interest. Tighter editing is needed. Instead of incorporating half-told secondary stories (such as Hughes liaison with Domergue) these could have been cut to better streamline the central narrative. The color they add is not worth the havoc the wreak upon the overall plot. For those with an interest in Hughes and/or the era in which he operated The Aviator represents a flawed but entertaining (and perhaps informative) tale. Others unfortunately will likely be more bored than engrossed once the first hour has passed.

"The Disrespected Arts Journalist Blues | | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Culture Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Observer Music The Disrespected Arts Journalist Blues By Justin Joffe  07/29/16 324pm Patron saint of schlubby music journalists Lester Bangs. More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

An enormously entertaining slice of biographical drama ""The Aviator"" flies like one of Howard Hughes record-setting speed airplanes. While it doesnt dig deeply into the psychology of one of the most famous industrialists and behavioral oddballs of the 20th century Martin Scorseses most pleasurable narrative feature in many a year is both extravagant and disciplined grandly conceived and packed with minutiae. Although he was not exactly born for the role Leonardo DiCaprio is in terrific movie star mode portraying an often inscrutable man whose passion for planes motion pictures and beautiful women is emphatically expressed. The director/star combo assures considerable public interest but the films commercial fate hangs on two big ifs -- the domestic Miramax release building momentum as a major awards contender into the new year and the lavish period piece capturing the interest of younger auds. Concentrating on the key years of the young Hughes greatest accomplishments from his splash in late-20s Hollywood with his World War I epic ""Hells Angels"" to setting flying records in the 30s and taking on the U.S. government and aviation giant Pan Am in the 40s screenwriter John Logan made difficult choices about what to dwell upon and what to sweep over in montage-like fashion. He has done so intelligently with preference for his subjects maniacal industriousness but with enough private moments to provide touchstones for his increasingly eccentric traits. Scorsese who came aboard the project when Michael Mann decided he couldnt do a third big bio picture in a row has injected his own mania for cinema into Hughes obsession for aviation and secondarily for filmmaking and actresses. Resulting energy propels every aspect of the production notably the performances exceptionally dense soundtrack and magnificent design. If ""Gangs of New York"" felt heavy and never found its proper rhythm ""The Aviator"" runs like a dream on all cylinders with scarcely a sputter or a cough. After an odd opening in which Hughes mother gives her young son an overly attentive bath during a flu quarantine action jumps to 1927 Hollywood when the 21-year-old Hughes already wealthy from the family oil well drill bits business sank millions into ""Hells Angels."" Hughes learning to direct on the job at his own expense was forced to remake most of his silent picture when sound came in driving the production schedule to three years. Scorseses action-painting evocation of the laborious shoot is exhilarating and amusing combining footage from the actual picture with shots of dozens of biplanes diving in dizzying patterns often with Hughes himself up in the air with a camera. At one point the director halts production until Mother Nature can provide the background he wants -- clouds that resemble giant breasts. Although Louis B. Mayer is seen being dismissive of the brash upstart at the Cocoanut Grove (just one of many locations lovingly recreated by production designer Dante Ferretti) film underplays the extent to which the outsider was shunned by the studio heads. Their hostility pushed Hughes into an increasingly adversarial stance toward Hollywood a position that foreshadowed his later contentious relationships with the aviation industry and Washington. Hughes breaths a sigh of relief after the successful premiere of ""Hells Angels"" at Graumans Chinese an event stunningly rendered via staged material and colorized vintage newsreel footage; with Hollywood Boulevard festooned with large model planes dangling overhead preem drew a reported 500000 people and served as the inspiration for Nathaniel Wests ""The Day of the Locust."" As the action jumps to the mid-30s Hughes lands a plane at the beach location of ""Sylvia Scarlett"" to fetch Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) for a round of golf. This cockeyed romance which lasts considerably longer in the film than it did in real life proves as charming as it is unlikely thanks in large measure to Blanchetts dead-on rendering of the stars hauteur and vocal peculiarities. Once the startling impact of her impersonation has subsided the relationship successfully defines itself as a pairing of two completely self-absorbed misfits. The bond is strengthened by the rarefied air they share as two of the most famous people in the world romanticized in a lovely ""date"" on Hughes plane over Los Angeles at night and unsettled in a brilliantly funny sequence in which Hepburn takes her beau to the family compound in Connecticut where the eccentric clans air of self-obsessed superiority makes the famous daughter look like a piker (Frances Conroys cameo as Mrs. Hepburn is indelible). Although he continued to dabble in pictures aviation consumed Hughes far more. Pic raptly documents his creation of the H-1 Racer a sleek silver bullet in which he set the world speed record; his record-setting 1936 round-the-world flight (partly conveyed by doc footage in which DiCaprios face has been laid ""Zelig""-like over the real thing); his 1946 test flight of the XF-11 which concluded with its pilots nearly fatal crash into several houses in Beverly Hills a spectacle rendered here with incredible force and detail; his support for the swan-like Constellation passenger plane which made his TWA into a world-class airline and his contentious construction of the worlds biggest flying machine the Hercules or Spruce Goose the one and only flight of which provides the picture with its stirring climax. Since planes represent one of the great subjects for motion picture cameras enthusiasts will have a field day watching all these amazing aircraft onscreen both in live-action and in eminently satisfying CGI representations. Its not that you cant tell when a flight is being digitally rendered but its all done amazingly well -- the degree of artifice surrounding the entire picture allows the computer work to fit in gracefully rather than to stick out. Said artifice is established by a visual style devised by Scorsese and cinematographer Robert Richardson that emphasizes the primary colors dominant in the Technicolor images of 30s and 40s Hollywood albeit with subtle gradations that shift according to the era. While ""The Aviator"" is not remotely intended to look or feel like a classical studio picture -- theres far too much movement and razzle-dazzle -- Scorsese artfully uses all the latest techniques in the service of evoking the periods in question. In every respect the film is a technological marvel. Dramatically story crescendos with the rivalry between Hughes and Pan Ams Juan Trippe (a very effective Alec Baldwin) whose monopoly on international air travel by a U.S. company Hughes means to break with his TWA Constellations. Trippe (whose office in the upper realms of the Chrysler Building is a wonder to behold) acquires a powerful crony in Sen. Ralph Owen Brewster (Alan Alda superb) who intends to crush Hughes in Senate hearings pinned to the tycoons alleged squandering of government money on failed airplane projects. Rooted according to the scripts logic in his mothers protective preoccupation Hughes exhibits an increasing phobia about germs expressed in ever-more bizarre behavior in public restrooms as well as insecurity about his deafness and mental stability. He comes temporarily unhinged after his 1946 plane crash locking himself in his screening room and growing a beard long hair and nails while sexy images of Jane Russell flicker on the screen all intimating the bizarre accounts of his reclusive later life. The huge number of women Hughes collected over the years can only be glancingly noted. Of them just two beyond Hepburn are even shown Faith Domergue (Kelli Garner) a hapless teenager Hughes groomed for never-to-be stardom and more prominently Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale). Although the latter pops up mostly argumentatively several times the nature of her relationship with Hughes remains unclear (by her own testimony they never slept together) giving their scenes fu zzy import. Physically DiCaprio is not as tall rangy or rugged as the real Hughes and the remnants of his baby face are at utter odds with the angles and creases of Hughes mug. But the actor completely engages with the role in all the ways that count conveying utter absorption in his work driving perfectionism masculine allure public reticence increasing eccentricity and simmering hostility for anything that stands in his way. One can still imagine that Warren Beatty would once have been the ideal bigscreen Hughes and regret that Beatty never managed to make what should have been his great romance of capitalism to match his epic romance of communism ""Reds."" But DiCaprio puts his imprint on the part with surprising effectiveness. Aside from members of Hughes inner circle played with intentional modesty by John C. Reilly Ian Holm Matt Ross and Adam Scott other characters sweep in and out like gusts of wind Among them are Errol Flynn (a vivaciously insouciant Jude Law) Jean Harlow (Gwen Stefani with a couple of lines) MPAA censorship czar Joseph Breen (a harrumphing Edward Herrmann) and a sleazy magazine publisher (Willem Dafoe). Ever-present music plays a key role in sustaining the films effervescence as Howard Shores propulsive original score meshes seamlessly with an enormous assortment of popular tunes from the periods played boisterously in nightclub settings or subtly in the background.
