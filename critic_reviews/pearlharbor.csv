Well Not Quite By Andrew Sarris  06/11/01 1200am I spent Memorial Day weekend catching up on Shrek (directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson from a screenplay by Ted Elliott Terry Russio Joe Stillman and Roger S. H. Schulman based on the book by William Steig) and Pearl Harbor (directed by Michael Bay from a screenplay by Randall Wallace). Shrek has had nothing but good reviews; Pearl Harbor almost nothing but bad. After seeing Shrek with an appreciative audience I decided its good notices were fully justified and I dreaded what promised to be the three-hour ordeal of Pearl Harbor . But Pearl Harbor was not nearly so hard to take as I had anticipated. I even got a bit teary-eyed over its full-bodied romanticism and anachronistic nobility which reminded me of a period I had experienced firsthand though admittedly at the hyper-susceptible age of 13. My more justifiably enthusiastic response to Shrek  however had to overcome my habitual resistance to animation as an alternative to live-action cinematography. Still I am willing to concede that animated films are more ""artistic"" than live-action films in that there is more human control in the former than there is in the latter. This is to say that Kate Beckinsale was not created by the filmmakers who utilized her talent. There is an irreducible core of reality to her feisty beauty. The point is that Shrek  possibly the most accomplished and articulate animated film ever made lacks something that one experiences with even a very ordinary-and at best only marginally meritorious-war movie like Pearl Harbor  a feeling of kinship with images of life in real time on the screen. I am perhaps indulging a humanist bias on my part that is totally at odds with the tastes of todays more gadgety and cyberspatially driven young people who make up the target market audience for this new movie millennium. Nonetheless-and here is the ironic twist in my acceptance of Pearl Harbor -the parts I liked most are the parts before and after the digital destruction of Pearl Harbor by the Japanese carrier planes. For me the only use of spectacle here as in Titanic  is for the enhancement and redemption of the major characters. Mr. Bay and Mr. Wallace borrow proudly and shamelessly from many old movies not the least of which are Gone With the Wind (1939) and Children of Paradise (1945). They achieve only faint echoes of the originals of course but there is more than a suggestion of Scarlett with the wounded in Atlanta and of Garance offering herself to the misguidedly noble Baptiste in Paris in Ms. Beckinsales Nurse Evelyn Johnson. In one instance Evelyn is overwhelmed by the carnage in Pearl Harbor; in another she is disappointed by the misplaced scruples of Ben Afflecks Rafe McCawley. Mr. Affleck has taken a lot of heat for not being a big enough star to carry a love story in a special-effects superproduction but he is as good as most-if not all-of the 20 million superstars. Indeed I have seen him be good in so many underrated melodramas that I cant dump on him here. In the end Pearl Harbor is not so much about World War II as it is about movies about World War II. And whats wrong with that? We certainly dont need to revive our hatred of ""the Japs"" at this late date. A few years after the war Nat Holman then basketball coach at City College visited Japan to give some basketball clinics and he was astonished to discover that these polite and civilized people were the same ones who had bombed Pearl Harbor. This is something Pearl Harbor doesnt pick up on the sheer disbelief in the United States that a despised race of people would have the technical and strategic know-how to destroy the mighty American fleet and then sink two British battleships that had sailed confidently to relieve Singapore. This condescension to Japan lasted into the 50s when American cineastes were amazed to discover in Akira Kurosawas Rashomon and Kenji Mizoguchis Ugetsu  the spearheads of a vibrant Japanese film industry going back to the silent era. Still what Pearl Harbor cannot be forgiven is its 135 million price tag-as if with all that money a filmmaker should be able to purchase Shavian dialogue and Chekhovian pathos. This is hardly the first time critics wound up reviewing the money rather than the movie. I was in Cannes in 1979 when Francis Ford Coppolas Apocalypse Now was unveiled and all that the American and British critics on the scene wanted to talk about was its fiscal extravagance in the face of its anemic commercial prospects. Twenty-two years later the uncut Apocalypse Now was hailed as the best film at Cannes and no one seemed to care about how much it had cost. Erich von Stroheim and Orson Welles were buried in Hollywood under the tombstone of needless extravagance and even Michael Cimino was treated more roughly than he deserved for Heavens Gate (1980) a film that stays in the mind despite its undeniable bottom-line follies. And lets not talk about Max Ophuls and Lola Montes (1955)-after Welles The Magnificent Ambersons (1942) and Jean Renoirs The Rules of the Game (1939) my favorite box-office disaster. Pearl Harbor is not in this class of creative extravagance and as I have suggested its celebrated bang-bang scenes are closer to animation than to live-action cinematography. As for the widely panned kiss-kiss scenes I cannot recommend them to my readers because that would arouse expectations that could not be fulfilled. The best way to see the movie is as I did expecting nothing and being pleasantly surprised and strangely moved by Mr. Bays audacity in filming his lovers in end-of-the-world close-ups however briefly. This is a choice I applaud despite the risks it runs with reviewers. There is less to say about Shrek that has not already been said many times over. The film has been heralded as the antithesis of everything Disney stands for from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to Pearl Harbor . Still as much as I like and admire Shrek  I am not prepared to give up Dumbo (1941) Pinocchio (1940) Bambi (1942) and especially Thumper Mickey Mouse Donald Duck and all the inspired Goofy sports cartoons. And of course there is Tex Avery and Mr. Magoo Bugs Bunny and the Road Runner-and lets not forget The Simpsons and South Park . Have I implied that I dont like animation? Lets say Ive kept looking at it out of the corner of my eye-or better still lets never say never. Or even more embarrassingly lets say that we never entirely grow up. Im not sure I can adequately describe the advances in animation represented by Shrek  which may be another reason why I shy away from posing as an authority on the subject. I know what I like on the narrative level. The backgrounds look interestingly detailed and the donkey in particular has his anatomy and its movements imaginatively integrated with his smart-ass personality. What Shrek is saying to both its adult and child audience is mainly that ugly creatures can find happiness together if they find and appreciate each others inner beauty or some such sentimental and politically correct nonsense. Since most of us look more like the Ogre in Shrek than what most people would consider an adequate prince in shining armor its a fairly popular message to send. Of course looks dont matter in the game of love-as long as that assumption is not tested too often on the screen. What gives Shrek its special artistic distinction is its witty and knowingly sassy dialogue delivered by vocally charismatic performers whose voices remind us of their stellar screen personae in live-action movies. As we were leaving the theater my companion and I wondered aloud why Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy didnt have marvelous Shrek -like lines in their recent live-action bonanzas. Here was Shrek  a cartoon directed largely at children with more adult dialogue than either the Austin Powers or Nutty Professor idiocies in which Mr. Myers and Mr. Murphy were enmeshed respectively for the benefit of their bankbooks. We had almost forgotten how subversively funny both could be. And the same complaint can be made for the corny vulgar vehicles in which a comic genius like Robin Williams has found himself trapped in recent years. Perhaps he needs a Shrek -like regeneration to regain his comic and satiric edge. Cameron Diaz as the spunky Princess Fiona and John Lithgow as the grotesquely diminutive Lord Farquaad round out the cast of iconoclasts trampling on the flowers of chivalry as well as the blessed creatures from Disneys Magic Kingdom. For once all the ""inside jokes"" work so that takeoffs on televised blind-date shows and the magic mirror in Snow White  and a lovesick fire-spouting dragon who encapsulates all the anthropomorphic excesses of the Disney oeuvre  do not slow down the narrative flow to a trickle. I was happy in the end for Shrek because he was both discriminating enough to accept his limitations and courageous enough to realize that he didnt need a beauty to complete or transform him. I am reminded of Marlene Dietrichs (or was it Greta Garbos?) complaint after a screening of Jean Cocteaus Beauty and the Beast (1946) with its conventional ending of the Beast transformed into a prince. ""Give me back my Beast"" she cried. Still Shrek goes even further by imagining the blissful union of two Beasts figuratively speaking and that makes for an original fable indeed.

By Anthony Lane The last Michael Bay film ""Armageddon"" was a handy guide to what you should do when an asteroid bumps into your planet. At the time most critics scorned the picture as deafening and dumb; in retrospect it feels like a mature even witty exercise in self-reference considering that the effect of watching a Michael Bay film is indistinguishable from having a large pointy lump of rock drop on your head. His new picture ""Pearl Harbor"" maintains the mood pulsing with fervor as it tells a tale familiar to every child in America how a great nation was attacked and humbled by the imperious pride of Ben Affleck. He plays Rafe a dyslexic Tennessee farm boy who has loved flying ever since he was old enough to crash. At least I think hes from Tennessee; his accent takes a patriotic tour of several states as if to indicate that the noble Rafe could have come from just about anywhere. His best buddy is Danny (Josh Hartnett); they join the Air Force together and play chicken in the skies over Long Island much to the admiring wrath of Colonel Doolittle (Alec Baldwin) one of several real-life figures in the movie. Rafe is a young man of unusual courage. For one thing he volunteers to be shipped to England to serve in the R.A.F. For another he chooses the eve of his departure to inform his new girlfriend an Air Force nurse named Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) that he will not make love to her just now on the ground that he wants to save something for later; this sacrifice which leaves Evelyn looking a little huffy makes Rafe unique in the annals of human warfare. She is posted to the heat of Pearl Harbor where she sits and reads letters from a shivering Rafe. What a tribute to the forces of love; our heros dyslexia chronic though undiagnosed cannot stop him writing to his beloved or avidly reading the sheaves that come in return. Life in Hawaii is sweet for Evelyn as indicated by the large number of pineapples that are randomly distributed around the set. She has time to sit by the shore in natty little two-piece swimsuits dreaming of Rafe and presumably trying not to notice Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr making out in the adjoining cove. Medical duties are light composed mainly of soothing the scalded butts of zealous sunbathers and stitching the wounds of a young cook and boxer--another real-lifer Dorie Miller (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who becomes the first black sailor to be awarded the Navy Cross. (After his gotta-be-the-best diver in ""Men of Honor"" Gooding is fast running out of water-based trailblazers.) This is one of those long but bitty movies in which actors get their characters handed out like parcels of rations--a nervous tic for you a knot of frustration for him. Evelyn and the other nurses are delighted with a gang of fliers who are assigned to Pearl Harbor; we get Gooz (Michael Shannon) a fellow of few words and many bruises Red (Ewen Bremner) who has a comedy stammer that you just know will kick in at a vital juncture and above all Rafes friend Danny. Uh-oh. The moment he appeared looking shy and sculpted my radar picked up a large aggressive plot twist steaming in from the northwest. When news arrived that Rafe was missing in action presumed dead after being shot down off the coast of England I switched to full alert. Soon enough Dannys attempts at consolation melt into drinks illicit flights at dusk over the ocean and the urge to do on a bed of parachutes what Rafe declined to do at a perfectly comfortable hotel in New York. And then of course Rafe turns up back with his unit alive and well and deeply pissed to see his friend and his girl going hula to hula. And then to make matters worse thousands of these Japanese guys turn up although as far as we know few of them are driven by a specific wish to go out with Kate Beckinsale. In fact observing this movie I am not sure what they want; Michael Bay whose passion for geopolitical history tends to be exceeded by his interest in fireballs gives the enemy a dramatic shrift so short that even the most red-blooded American viewers may feel a trifle embarrassed. If your movie is three hours long with minor characters packed like sardines into every nook you should perhaps find space for a young Japanese pilot--a name to go with a face. And if your budget is a hundred and thirty-five million dollars you might consider something more sophisticated than a shot of the Japanese high command huddled over a small swimming pool watching models of American ships being poked around with a rod. To be fair Bay does pay elaborate homage to the niceties of Japanese weaponry. Long before I saw ""Pearl Harbor"" I was told to look out for the in-bomb camera but thats not quite how it works; we dont perch on the nose so much as trail tightly behind so that we can feel the whirring air and watch the looming target. Bay makes a fetish of the tiny propeller at the bombs rear gazing with kinky horror as it spins and then stops. He cuts away holds for a microsecond then delivers the bang and the boom. This blend of the minutely detailed and the enormously lurid is like the degraded fallout of a Pop Art sensibility; think of Lichtenstein and Rosenquist of big pleading faces and fighter planes then strip away the enamelling of irony and you are left with the customized weirdness of the summer war movie in which all strife is a blast. Needless to say ""Pearl Harbor"" works like a demon to pretend otherwise. We are offered regular sermons notably from Alec Baldwin in his briefings and from Kate Beckinsale in a final voice-over on the principles of combat and the lessons of loss; and our eyes are averted to Washington D.C. where a staunch F.D.R. (Jon Voight) urges his countrymen first to vigilance and then to arms. On the other hand it must be said that a Washington in which Dan Aykroyd plays an expert in naval intelligence is not a Washington that would enjoy ones undivided confidence. Still that is not Bays field; his field is the buckling deck of the U.S.S. Arizona her white-clad inhabitants blown through the air like exploding angels and the vertiginous tilt when she groans over and starts to sink. As the men slid to the water I realized that the model for ""Pearl Harbor"" was not other war films but James Camerons ""Titanic"" not the sober battle-by-numbers approach of ""Tora Tora Tora"" but the entwining of special effects and a love story that hopes by sheer stamina to grow special itself. To complain that the digital work in ""Pearl Harbor"" feels cold and gray is not saying much given that the movie is about battleships; nevertheless too much of the hardware--the toppling gantries the Japanese Zeros that breed like rabbits in the air--is flattened by a matte dullness like a kids set of see-through stickers. After the onslaught of false textures it comes as a relief to take refuge in the look of the living not least in the face of Kate Beckinsale who is filmed with rapturous care. She comes on the heels of Nicole Kidman in ""Moulin Rouge"" another alabaster goddess who calms a hectic film; staring at the pair of them I get a pleasant goosebumpy feeling that if nothing else mid-2001 will go down as the summer of skin. There is no doubt of course which of the boys will wind up with Evelyn a woman at once so sexy and so saintly that she removes a stocking in the middle of the bombing raid to make an emergency tourniquet causing me to wonder whether the patients blood pressure is supposed to go up or down; what surprised me was how long it took for the winning lover to emerge. As Pearl Harbor lay smoldering and the triumphant Japanese admiral uttered the words ""I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant"" I got up to leave. After all that was pretty much the line that brought ""Tora Tora Tora"" to a close. Then I glanced at my watch sighed and sat down again; forty-five minutes still to go and were off into an entirely new narrative with Alec Baldwin recruiting the boys for yet another mission. ""Do you know what top secret is?"" he asks--the second-best question of the film topped only when Evelyn finds Rafe packing a suitcase and quick as a flash says ""Packing?"" She is understandably distraught by her sudden change of fortunes. One moment she is trying to cope with two grown men scrapping over her like a couple of roosters and the next as she says in some exasperation ""All this happened."" I am not absolutely sure what she means by ""this"" but I imagine that she is referring to the trifling matter of an enraged United States being hauled into a global conflict. I guess we should thank Michael Bay for so bold a revisionist take on the Second World War no longer the clash of virtuous freedom and a malevolent tyranny but a terrible bummer when a girl is trying to get her dates straight. What Rafe is setting off for--complete with Danny a Silver Star and a fresh head of highlights--is the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo in the spring of 1942 when bombers were launched off the deck of a carrier. Its a great saga and I applaud movies that take the trouble to sing the unsung but it doesnt belong here and the audience started to rustle with impatience--something I never expected to hear at a movie directed by Michael Bay and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. Why did they go with this plan? Maybe Jerry sidled up to Michael halfway through the shoot and whispered ""Bad news. I just learned that this Hawaiian thing--with the planes and the ships right?--well it wasnt so great for us. Apparently the Japs won. We lost."" So they tacked on another story and went out on a high. ""Pearl Harbor"" may be stirring proof that right will prevail but I hate to think what will happen when these guys get their hands on ""King Lear.""

With Ben Affleck Josh Hartnett Kate Beckinsale Alec Baldwin Cuba Gooding Jr. Jon Voight. Directed by Michael Bay. Running time 183 mins. Rated PG-13 War violence language. 2 Stars. Pearl Harbor"" is a bomb make no mistake. But the movie is such a noisy persistent bomb that it is guaranteed to draw a crowd. Director Michael Bays silly bloated war extravaganza is just sophisticated enough to convey the outrage at the surprise Japanese attack that galvanized America into entering WWII. But horrifying an audience with digitally enhanced war carnage - sailors blasted out of their skivvies while brushing their teeth the tinny tap of men trapped inside overturned battleships - is not enough to justify the three-hour running time. What ""Pearl Harbor"" needs are characters you care about in a story that isnt as riddled with cliches as a downed fighter plane is with bullets. And sorry Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett are just not up to the job of appearing to win the war single-handedly dressed in florid Hawaiian shirts and armed with can-do moxie. Whenever your admiration for their characters flags theres a blast of soaring music or a snippet of canned dialogue to remind you how to feel ""If there are any more like you at home"" a British officer says of Afflecks flying ace ""God help anyone who goes to war with America"" A PARADISE LOST On Dec. 7 1941 the Japanese virtually wiped out the U.S. Pacific fleet in a stealth raid that caught the sleepy Hawaiian outpost off guard. America was not officially in the war at that point and the military and medical personnel stationed at Pearl Harbor were like vacationers in paradise. ""Were as far from the fighting as you can get"" says one character with the kind of underlined irony that Randall Wallaces script smears all over like sunblock. The date that as FDR promised would live in infamy is rife with dramatic possibilities for the big screen. But there is something grotesque and disrespectful about reliving the massacre for the sake of spectacle. An intense half-hour of cool wall-to-wall combat sequences is sandwiched between hours of a predictable sappy romantic triangle that is hardly worthy of the epic treatment it receives. Affleck and Hartnett play Rafe and Danny childhood pals who grow up to be just what they always dreamed - maverick pilots for the Army Air Force. With their clean-cut good looks and fierce loyalty to friend and country they are Americas finest. But they were all dressed up in leather bomber jackets with no place to go. America was not yet at war so pilots like Rafe and Danny spend more time courting an eager brigade of nurses than doing any serious training. Rafe falls for beautiful Nurse Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) and shows her a nice sunset. He goes off to fight in England and when he isnt heard from for a while Danny shows Evelyn an equally nice sunset and romantic complications ensue. Or as Evelyn later puts it waving her arm in despair at the inconveniently blood-soaked full-to-bursting hospital ward Everything was fine ""and then all this happened"" In bit parts Jon Voight looks uncannily like President Roosevelt and Cuba Gooding Jr. is around just enough to make us want to know more about his character a mess hall sailor who mans a machine gun and takes on the swooping Japanese Zeros. Alec Baldwin seems just this side of unhinged as the risk-taking Col. James Doolittle who collects his favorite former students for a daring air raid whose effect is hampered by an awkwardly staged denouement. The actresses who play the giggly boy-crazy nurses look more like a porn cast on their way to a location shoot. The movie is full of bizarre moments that come off as howlingly inappropriate. In the heart of the chaos Evelyn draws blood simultaneously from her rival paramours into Coke bottles as if they are on a group date at the soda fountain. Irony alert Code red The movies combat scenes are undeniably stirring. But the 2400 Americans who lost their lives at Pearl Harbor deserve a nobler memorial than this sentimental hogwash that reduces heroism to ""Top Gun"" antics and pretty cinematography.

After all they took the trouble of listing most of us in the credits. Hunting for your name in the 10-plus minutes of end credits would be far more productive than watching the nearly three hours of dreck that precedes them. ""Pearl Harbor"" may well be the ultimate modern example of Hollywood bloat and bilge. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay flung 135 million -- 135 million -- at their subject and produced a dumb soulless behemoth that delivers the cinematic equivalent of shell shock. For all the 118 actors listed the movie offers almost no sense of authentic humanity. The faces the filmmakers plaster on their characters are as flat and stereotyped as those on war-recruitment posters. The Bay-Bruckheimer formula of treating people as secondary to explosions worked just fine in ""The Rock"" and ""Armageddon."" Those movies bordered on live-action cartoons. But Bay and Bruckheimer are now dealing in something bigger than a terrorist siege on Alcatraz or even a planet-killing asteroid. Their subject is real fresh in the collective memory and vital in recent world history. You cant tell the story of Pearl Harbor without blowing a lot of things up but with so much money to burn the filmmakers could have channeled a little more to script and character development. Ben Affleck is at his most boring as Rafe McCawley who trains as a fighter pilot with childhood buddy Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett going toe-to-toe with Affleck for dullness). Rafe falls for Navy nurse Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale who gives an uncharacteristically numb performance). Their romance is shattered after Rafe is presumed dead in the Battle of Britain where hed joined a U.S. squadron. Both now stationed at Pearl Harbor Danny and Evelyn commiserate. Next thing you know Evelyns friends are telling her to move on with her life that its been all of three months and she needs to get back into circulation. Guess whose arms she circulates into? And guess who turns up alive in Pearl Harbor barely a day before the Japanese attack? The script by Randall Wallace is forced and foolish an epic soap opera. The first half of ""Pearl Harbor"" is spent on Rafe and Dannys tedious friendship and their monotonous relationships with Evelyn. Theres no spark between Beckinsale and either leading man while Affleck and Hartnett never muster any kinship as friends or rivals. Supporting players include Jon Voight as Franklin Roosevelt Alec Baldwin as Col. Jimmy Doolittle and Cuba Gooding Jr. Dan Aykroyd Mako and Tom Sizemore all pretty much phoning in roles that have little dimension. The star of ""Pearl Harbor"" is the 40-minute attack sequence a combination of live explosions and digital effects. Theres a handful of gripping images of sailors on sinking ships but the battle isnt terribly artful or original in capturing the horrors of war. The violence is sanitized for sake of a PG-13 rating. Bay and Bruckheimer also had an eye on political correctness to avoid offending Japanese audiences. Japans rulers are treated superficially and sympathetically as leaders who feel compelled to attack to preserve their way of life. For all its feebleness ""Pearl Harbor"" will have audiences lined up around the block. Disney has marketed the stuffing out of the movie making it seem like a patriotic duty to see it. Thats the real offense. ""Pearl Harbor"" is rated PG-13 for sustained intense war sequences images of the wounded brief sensuality and some language. Running time 182 minutes.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Director Michael Bay made his name directing commercials and in a sense never really stopped even as The Rock Bad Boys and Armageddon made him one of Americas best-known directors. Bays work may no longer directly shill tennis shoes or beer but he and producer Jerry Bruckheimer continue to blur the lines separating entertainment advertising and propaganda with feature-length commercials for an idealized notion of American goodness and their special brand of cinematic overkill. Bays skill as a propagandist culminates in Pearl Harbor a pricey three-hour film set in a whitewashed version of 1941 America that looks like a Disneyland attraction designed by Norman Rockwell. Ben Affleck leads a large universally wasted cast playing not just a hero but heroism personified--a wholesome noble-but-arrogant pilot who is not about to let dyslexia get in the way of giving his all for the land he loves. Shot down and presumed dead while fighting for the British Affleck returns to Hawaii to learn that his beautiful unsuspecting girlfriend (Kate Beckinsale) has taken up with his heroic best friend (Josh Hartnett) after receiving news of Afflecks supposed death. But just as Bays film threatens to turn into a military version of As The World Turns the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor pushing the trio to new heights of nobility as they attempt to save their curiously white-bread paradise from interchangeable unsmiling warmongers. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor is easily the movies highlight partly because of Bays skill at directing large-scale action sequences but mainly because it provides a brief respite from Randall Wallaces laughable dialogue and nighttime-soap-ready plotting. Like previous Bay/Bruckheimer productions Pearl Harbor bounds from contrived climax to contrived climax never letting audiences forget that theyre watching a pop-cultural event and a legendarily expensive one at that. In Bays world every shot is the money shot and people dont talk so much as make bold pronouncements windy speeches and sweeping declarations. The language of Wallaces script is the universal tongue of the unapologetic cliche and Bay films the proceedings without a shred of self-consciousness or moral ambiguity. Leave it to Bay and Bruckheimer to reduce one of Americas biggest military tragedies into a three-hour avalanche of Kodak moments and one of Americas defining crises into a facile exercise in fake uplift.

Comments Pearl Harbor Three hours and three minutes of guff and goo about the nobility of killing and/or being killed for arbitrary reasons whether youre an American soldier or a Japanese. This is the Star Wars view of the U.S.s entry into World War II (enemies are invisible and bloodless) which means that even though much of the story takes place in Hawaii Hawaiians are deemed inconsequential and the only ordinary Japanese we ever see apart from a few old soldiers are passing details in two shots kids in the distance flying a kite and a couple of nice ladies in kimonos both viewed before--not during or after--an air attack. If you decide to hit the concessions stand (where youre bound to have lots of company) Id suggest going out for popcorn during either the first hour or the third because the second features some pretty good big-screen effects involving planes ships and explosions. (This is from the same team that brought you The Rock and Armageddon.) The lead characters are fairly interchangeable jocks and nurses--a bit like the characters in Starship Troopers but without the irony aside from Jon Voight under tons of makeup striking presidential poses as FDR. (When he struggles out of his wheelchair like Dr. Strangelove to make a point we arent supposed to laugh.) We also get Cuba Gooding Jr. as a cook in the segregated army who finally gets to shoot at Japs just like the heroes (Ben Affleck and Josh Harnett) who--would you believe it?--are in love with the same nurse (Kate Beckinsale). Michael Bay who coproduced with schlockmeister Jerry Bruckheimer directed the pedestrian Randall Wallace script; other cast members include Tom Sizemore Colm Feore Alec Baldwin and Dan Aykroyd.

Pearl Harbor is all of the above but theres no dismissing the film if only because it offers another long loud example of how Hollywood remains the hagiographic spinmeister of American war history. By any sane estimate the 1941 Japanese destruction of the Pacific Fleet in Hawaii was a humiliating defeat for a smugly unprepared and arrogant Navy elite a criminal loss of life for thousands of sailors and -- for Franklin Roosevelt (whos nicely played in the movie by guess who wearing a new chin that makes him all but unrecognizable) if not for his generals -- an object lesson in the high cost of isolationism. Hardly an occasion for heroic triumphalism. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - In more than one recent interview Bay has declared himself an ardent patriot. So he is in his way and its no wonder that Pearl Harbor was made with enthusiastic cooperation not to mention script doctoring by the U.S. Navy which even provided Disney with a state-of-the-art aircraft carrier for the 5 million premiere party it threw a few hundred yards from the site of the attack. Bay buys lock stock and barrel into the revisionist guff that has pulled victory from defeat and made the whole debacle bearable to Americans down the years (and which is superbly dispatched in John Gregory Dunnes vivisection in a recent New Yorker of the Navys ""heroic"" presence in Hawaii).The first hour of the movie is devoted to setting up three heroic representatives of the Greatest Generation -- two aviation buddies and the woman both will come to love -- with a PG-13 jocularity designed to make Michael Eisners summer chortling sight gags for the 13-year-old boys; for the girls a bevy of rosy nurses giggling behind their hands as they ogle the military talent. Ben Affleck who is no actor but makes a perfectly presentable pinup plays crop-duster Rafe McCawley who having won the heart of nurse Evelyn Johnson (played by the elfin British beauty Kate Beckinsale) announces that though he doesnt want to die hes ""anxious to matter"" and takes off to fly decrepit planes for the British. When Rafe goes MIA Evelyn takes up with his shy best friend Danny (Josh Hartnett who looks like a young Tommy Lee Jones only sweet). Then when Rafe (as all men named Rafe must) rises from the dead a love triangle ensues in which Evelyn becomes a decorative accessory to the real couple implied in all such movies here called Danny and Rafe.That this is so much filler to keep the female audience on track will be news to no one for meanwhile Bay has been gearing up for the stuff that really gets his wicky-wack going -- a 40-minute set piece all swooping planes and underwater pyrotechnics depicting the Japanese invasion and the entombment of nearly 1000 American sailors on the USS Arizona. The sequence is stunning but its hallucinatory -- and yes titanic -- technical virtuosity makes you feel like youre watching the next Star Wars installment not a 60-year-old catastrophe. Indeed theres a muddled unreality about the whole movie with its strange brew of racial sensitivity and jingoism. Bay has bent over backward not to offend the sensibilities of Japanese-Americans let alone the millions of Japanese moviegoers who will fill the Disney coffers when Pearl Harbor opens in Tokyo. But the gloves come off with a vengeance when it falls to Alec Baldwin -- as Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle who led the suicide mission to bomb the hell out of Tokyo and put the roses back in the cheeks of Central Command -- to belt out a go-get-the-bastards speech that raises Randall Wallaces screenplay already knee-deep in platitude to dizzying new heights of silliness that top anything he wrote for Braveheart. World War II undoubtedly had its Greatest Generation but the men who died at Pearl Harbor were not heroes but victims not only of the Japanese but of their own masters.Like Steven Spielberg -- and Oliver Stone Stanley Kubrick Brian De Palma and so many others before him -- Bay is all too eager to show us the agony of war and it must be said that the most haunting passages in Pearl Harbor are those culled from survivors stories that hammer home the arbitrary savagery of warfare in which its the luckiest not the pluckiest who survive. Still Bays pouting to the L.A. Times that he was frustrated at not being able to make the movie more violent in order to show the full carnage of combat has a certain disingenuous reek. For directors like Bay -- and Spielberg et al. -- war offers prime action material and they have at their disposal enough techno-toys to make each new film the mother of all war movies. At regular intervals during the invasion sequence a shaven-headed young man sitting next to me slapped his thigh and whooped appreciatively. One wonders whether it even occurred to him that the bombs-away orgy that so jazzed him has some basis in real life or whether World War II will forever be emblazoned in his memory as a great big shiny special effect.

Except for the central 40-minute attack sequence this 140 million Jerry Bruckheimer-Michael Bay World War II extravaganza features a script that Jack Warner would have found wanting even for a propaganda meller at the time. The bombs explode brilliantly but the story is a bust in ""Pearl Harbor."" Except for the central 40-minute attack sequence which combines razzle-dazzle pyrotechnics with high grade visual effects to deliver the destructive spectacle people want to see this 140 million Jerry Bruckheimer-Michael Bay World War II extravaganza features a script that Jack Warner would have found wanting even for a propaganda meller at the time along with a cast perfectly in tune with its shallowness. Resulting three-hour opus which plays out from here to what seems like eternity isnt bad enough to keep the public from flocking to it in the kind of numbers that will support its seemingly pre-ordained status as the No. 1 film of the summer. But for all the coin the picture will generate the tepid love triangle hardly seems like one that audiences will genuinely and warmly embrace. Although not willfully inaccurate in its account of Japans surprise attack on the Hawaiian home base of the United States Pacific Fleet on the morning of Dec. 7 1941 the event that triggered Uncle Sams entry into the war more than two years after it began Randall Wallaces screenplay takes a Classics Illustrated fifth grade approach to one of 20th century historys most literally explosive moments. Preferring to recycle standard-issue inspirational cliches from the period rather than to delve into the many fascinating elements that led to the clash pic represents the anti-historical approach Hollywood seems to think the modern public prefers. With ""Titanic"" clearly serving as its artistic and financial model ""Pearl Harbor"" seeks to honor all those who selflessly dedicated and in many cases sacrificed themselves for their country. But the characters even given the ample opportunity of such protracted running time dont exhibit any traits other than noble patriotism and romantic distress. What the viewer is left with then are visions of staggering action conflict and tragedy played out on the grandest of possible canvases but with no one you know or care about to emotionally pull you into the events. Watching the 350 Japanese fighters and bombers blast away at American ships and personnel in something close to real time is arresting and vivid but its not wrenching or breathtaking or heart-stopping; you think more about what it took to put it onscreen rather than being swept up in it. What prevents the attack from packing its full punch are the 80 minutes of dreariness that precede it. All well ever know about Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker is what we learn in the prologue -- that theyve been best friends since their cornpone youths in Tennessee and have never wanted to do anything but fly. They get their chance in 1941 when they undergo some very ""Top Gun""-ish flight training on Long Island which is here miraculously graced by some imposing mountain backdrops. But their paths diverge when the impatient Rafe (Ben Affleck) volunteers for the English Eagle Squadron while Danny (Josh Hartnett) remains Stateside. Before leaving the somewhat goofy self-deprecating Rafe has an intense few weeks in New York with Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) a comely nurse who charms him by giving him a few sharp pokes in the backside and overlooking the fact that he cant make sense of the eye chart. Evelyn Rafe decides is the girl for him. Meanwhile Danny and Evelyn have ended up in balmy Oahu where military service repped a sort of precursor to Club Med even as the perceived Japanese threat was building. Pic acknowledges for about five seconds that there was Japanese espionage going on in the area and for about 10 seconds that American authorities were divided over what Japan might do and how best to prepare for it but entirely ignores the fascinating social/racial/political dynamic on the islands at the time. Nor does it take advantage of this lull before the storm to develop the characters in any interesting ways. Evelyn and her fellow nurse girlfriends remain narrowly man-minded and not a shred of personal background info is given to the female lead herself. The guys Danny pals around with are equally one-dimensional and another man Doris ""Dorrie"" Miller played by Cuba Gooding Jr. gets maybe 10 minutes of screen time to illustrate how blacks were subordinated in the segregated Navy of the time to menial jobs. Danny and an initially reluctant Evelyn are brought together in a union consummated in a swirl of photogenic white parachutes. But faster than you can say ""A Guy Named Joe"" who should turn up but Rafe ready for action in more ways than one. After a barroom brawl the guys have just acknowledged that they have no idea how theyll ever be able to see eye-to-eye again when the Japanese provide them with an answer out of the blue. Although never pretending to do justice to the Japanese side a la ""Tora Tora Tora"" neither does ""Pearl Harbor"" wish to offend one of the worlds biggest markets. So it makes do with brief formal scenes of Nipponese officers principally the attacks formulator and chief proponent Admiral Yamamoto (Mako) making subtitled pronouncements about the United States oil embargo having given them little choice but to go to war. Overall treatment of the Japanese is reasonably respectful and non-inflammatory given that they are still the bad guys herein; there are several references to the ""Japs"" but never anything worse. Rather the film reserves its most vigorous sanitization efforts to the almost total elimination of cigarettes from a military scene in which nearly everyone smoked. The same revisionism applied in ""Saving Private Ryan"" and its ludicrous. After the prolonged and frequently tedious build-up Bay misses another bet by refusing to permit a few minutes of quiet before the early morning skies fill with roaring Zeros Kates and Vals. Few settings offer a more alluring vision of earthly paradise than Hawaii and it seems perverse not to allow the audience to take a few deep if uneasy breaths before the main event. But while it is not as compulsively frenetic as it was in ""Armageddon"" Bays filmmaking style is still defined by relentless cutting and grandiose camera moves. And this seemingly ingrained inability to hold any shot more than a few seconds actually works against one of the prime goals of a war film -- to present a coherent sense of logistics the geographic relationship of one force versus another. It also ill-serves the epic style; when dozens of Japanese planes zoom down a long valley from the north toward Pearl Harbor one wants to behold the unique spectacle at length to let its horrific majesty become imprinted on the brain. The attack then is spectacular but not rousing. The physical verisimilitude is unimpeachable; a few explosions to the side the sequence avoids the usual CGI look and the combination of roaring planes swirling smoke splattering bullets scurrying soldiers fallen men desperate nurses and sinking boats creates a strong image of desperate chaos and confusion and fills the screen with visceral incident. In the midst of all the destruction the beginnings of American resistance are seen in the commandeering by Rafe and Danny of two fighter planes which engage the Japanese in dog fights that see seven Zeros bite the dust and eventually inspire Jimmy Doolittle (Alec Baldwin) to select the two buddies to join him four months later on his famous bombing raid on Tokyo. Casting reminds of a Warner Bros. war drama for which they couldnt get Humphrey Bogart or Errol Flynn so they went with George Raft or George Brent instead. Rafe is supposed to suffer from deep emotional hurt but the blandly handsome Affleck couldnt convince that hed ever so much as been turned down for a date much less lost the love of his life to his best friend. Hartnett comes off as a tag-along kid while Beckinsale is all fancy coiffures and thick lipstick in a role that is startlingly undefined. Just compare their superficiality to the complex characters in ""From Here to Eternity"" and whats missing here becomes terribly clear. Lenser John Schwartzman goes for the hard-edged contrasty look of 40s studio productions to sometimes interesting sometimes obvious effect although the film never takes on a thick atmosphere of its own. Score is unusually overbearing coming from Hans Zimmer with echoes of ""Gladiator"" bouncing around throughout.

Its a blisteringly expensive 140 million three-hour tapestry of flag-waving patriotic martyrdom that steals shamelessly from every war movie ever made about that fateful morning of Dec. 7 1941 when Japan launched an air and naval attack on Hawaiis Pearl Harbor that resulted in the deaths of more than 3000 soldiers and civilians as well as the destruction of the U.S. Pacific fleet and marked Americas entry into World War II. The real story of Pearl Harbor is a history lesson that deserves a more educated and responsible team of creators than producer Jerry Bruckheimer (Top Gun) hack screenwriter Randall Wallace (Braveheart) and director Michael Bay the schlock jock behind such trashy action flicks as Armageddon and The Rock. Only in Hollywood could so many untalented insensitive people be encouraged to waste so much money desecrating a vital chapter of the American heritage in the name of show-business greed. In a contrived and blatantly obvious attempt to combine the epic battles of Saving Private Ryan with the sweeping romanticism of Titanic (and maybe win some Oscars for excess if not originality) Pearl Harbor comes in three sections. Intercutting newsreel footage of Hitlers armies with idyllic shots of an innocent America jitterbugging to big-band swing music to give us a sense of time and place the first section traces the lives of two gung-ho childhood buddies from Tennessee Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) who follow their aviation dreams of loops and barrel rolls to the U.S. Army Air Corps in the summer of 1940. Rafe falls in love with a nurse named Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) the minute she jabs a needle into his ""cute butt"" but leaves her moon-faced and starry-eyed when he volunteers for active duty with the Royal Air Force to fight in the Battle of Britain. As this numbing soap opera drones on Rafe-who cannot read the letters on a simple optometrists chart-still manages to compose literate love letters outside a British pub while Evelyn writes hers from the ""safe zone"" of a Hawaiian beach wearing bougainvillea in her hair. After Rafe is shot down in the Atlantic Evelyn and Danny exchange bodily fluids in their grief presuming hes dead. (As if a three-hour movie would kill off Ben Affleck in the first half hour) Imagine their shock when Rafe arrives through a romantic gauze of curtains blowing gently in the breeze and finds out theyve been staining his sheets behind his back every kiss and remorseful tear accompanied by strings and heavenly choirs of hosannas on high. While the boys-who appear to love each other more than the blank and anorexic Evelyn-slug it out in a barroom set duplicating the one in the vastly superior Pearl Harbor saga From Here to Eternity we cut to a Japanese villain right out of a Charlie Chan movie who says stoically ""The rise and fall of our empire is at stake."" If youre wondering after 80 minutes of turgid melodrama that is never remotely believable what any of this has to do with the bombing of Pearl Harbor you are finally ready for section two. The action stuff Michael Bay is famous for is almost as hokey as the unconvincing love triangle under the banana trees. Before the mushy violins fade long enough for Evelyn to spring the news that shes pregnant the Japanese fighter pilots approach at dawn to the sound of drums like a Comanche war party heading for the wagon train. Like a sleeping tiger Mr. Bay arises from his slumber with tableaus of battle carnage that pull out all the stops hundreds of men sliding off the sides of flaming ships patients burned alive in hospital beds doctors giving blood transfusions with Coca-Cola bottles nurses marking the foreheads of patients who have already been given morphine with their lipstick. Except for one or two isolated moments (hands of dying sailors trapped below the hull of a ship reach out from a grate to hold Mr. Afflecks hands before going limp; Ms. Beckinsale ripping off her nylons to use as a tourniquet) these dizzying images never grab the heart. Bodies thrown through the air like Tinker Toys dont approximate the emotional involvement or evoke the tragic loss in Saving Private Ryan. Sure digital technology now makes it possible to follow a bomb all the way to its target from the bombs point of view while hundreds of horrified people are crushed in the stampede to escape. But Mr. Bay is less interested in the Terry and the Pirates cartoon heroism of Rafe and Danny dressed in hula shirts while shooting down seven Japanese planes. Despite the stunts the 35-minute attack sequence is a muddle of lightning cuts and ear-blasting fireworks. When the smoke clears Evelyn figures its time to tell Rafe shes going to have Dannys baby ""I didnt know until the day you showed up-and then all this happened"" The audience drowns out the sound track at last-with laughter. Clearly it is time for section three. In the third hour of what seems more like three days Franklin D. Roosevelt (an unrecognizable Jon Voight) unlocks his paralyzed legs stands up in a burst of vein-popping American patriotism and challenges his cabinet to match this impossible act of bravery by bombing Tokyo. In an annoying disregard for the passage of time its now 1942 and although Evelyn is still the size of a Quonset hut Rafe and Danny desert her again to join Colonel James Doolittle (Alec Baldwin) in a retaliatory suicide mission with 16 planes that are soon running out of fuel over enemy lines while Evelyn waits to see which of the men will raise her baby. In one final embrace as the Japanese approach the downed pilots with machine guns Rafe says ""You cant die-youre gonna be a father"" and Danny replies ""No you are."" Theres more but who can bear it? I for one couldnt wait to get home to my video collection and watch 30 Seconds Over Tokyo a much better (and infinitely less phony) depiction of Doolittles Raid with the added bonus of Spencer Tracy and Van Johnson in the bargain. In the epilogue Evelyn informs us that her brave men and their suicide mission were the turning point in World War II-a bit of news that must come as a shock to the surviving veterans of Guadalcanal Bataan Midway the Battle of the Bulge and the Normandy invasion. In the jumble of mixed intentions and missed opportunities it almost seems like an afterthought casting Cuba Gooding Jr. in the small role of real-life hero Dorie Miller the Navy cook who became the first black American to win the Navy Cross. Its a role so similar to the one he played in the recent Men of Honor that it scarcely registers as a stretch. In a similar waste of talent Dan Aykroyd pops in from time to time as an intelligence officer who warns the Pentagon the Japanese are on their way but nobody listens. The moral in this movie if there is one is ""Always trust Dan Aykroyd. He knows things."" Even with the impressive action sequences youd think someone would have shown some concern about a screenplay so riddled with cliches that the audience finds itself saying the lines before the actors do. In Pearl Harbor the stars may lack charisma but thats no excuse for making them look like typical Disney product placements. Kate Beckinsales Evelyn is so restrained and slackly underwritten you cant distinguish her from the other nurses. Ben Affleck does his standard cocky arrogant routine and Josh Hartnett is a wounded 8x10 glossy. Both of them are prettier than the girl they both love; the difference is that Mr. Affleck wears more serious mascara. For a film with a 40s retro design nobody smokes much and the lugubrious tonsil-busting pop song screeched out of tune by Faith Hill during the interminable end credits wrecks any claim to period authenticity. One can hear the Bruckheimer-Bay team now ""Lets throw in an Oscar contender for Best Song while were at it."" Millions of bombs are dropped in Pearl Harbor. They should have dropped the biggest bomb of all on the movie itself. Susannah McCorkle And the Blues The tragic death of Susannah McCorkle a native Californian who brought elegance perfectionism and order to the turbulence of jazz singing and took the cabaret world by storm has filled me with an overwhelming sadness. Leaping from the 16th-floor window of her apartment on West 86th Street in the early-morning darkness of May 19 was an uncustomarily violent final eight bars for a performer distinguished by grace self-control a sunny disposition and an obsessive abhorrence of anything disorderly. The diminishing world of sophisticated popular music mourns the loss of a great and unique stylist. But to her friends the loss is much greater than words can describe. McCorkle had an uncanny way of knowing instinctively when other people were in trouble. During each personal and professional setback in my own life she was the first person on the phone to offer comfort strength and a broad shoulder to lean on yet she couldnt find the inner resources to conquer the demons that challenged her own self-confidence. Those of us who were blessed by her friendship feel like failures yet she kept her own depression to herself. She was two people really. The first was a consummate artist with impeccable taste in music who sang spectacular songs uncluttered by all the boring improvised pretentiousness that makes jazz singers unlistenable constantly honed her craft spoke five languages fluently wrote brilliant articles and short stories recorded 17 albums and was religiously attentive to diet and exercise. The second was an insecure child-woman from a dysfunctional family with a history of mental illness who spent her life looking for love an independent feminist still craving romance a vulnerable stylist unappreciated by a large public audience a born care-giver with no one to care for. Uncertain of her future as a singer unable to deal with the crass and vulgar jerks who run the cabaret world suddenly without work and facing career setbacks she found herself isolated and losing her grip on reality. There is much more but the bottom line is that she could no longer negotiate the rude detours her life and work had taken. In her meticulous way she left this world alone leaving us haunted by the lyrics to ""Me and the Blues"" a Harry Warren song she learned from an old Mildred Bailey record and recorded on her first solo album ""Im goin down and tell my troubles to the river .... / Cant go on livin whod go on livin if they were in my shoes .... / Thats one way certain of separatin me and the blues."" Goodbye Susannah. Youre in a happier place now where no sour notes are heard and hope rests eternal but youve left the rest of us with new blues of our own.

(Touchstone) ""Pearl Harbor"" is definitely about December 7 1941 but it is not of December 7 1941. Its not even really of our age either. It has more of the feel of a film from roughly mid-war. Thats because its not just a generic World War II movie but a specific kind. In tone and mood it does not belong to the first wave of bitter agitprop those encomiums to genocide like ""Bataan"" and ""Air Force"" in which the Japanese were a monkey-race to be exterminated without mercy. But neither is it a post-Bulge post-Iwo late-war movie exhausted sacrifice-numbed and confidence-shattered so that the war was no longer a crusade but had become an ordeal. Rather its from that weird mid-war period where romantic idealization was still possible but tempered by an awareness of the depth and breadth of the struggle. The movies were no longer furious and racist; they had become passionate examinations of the emotional conflict between love and duty. The greatest of these films of course was ""Casablanca"" whose low-tech plot is subtly echoed underneath all the high-tech frenzy of ""Pearl Harbor."" And that is one reason why until a disappointing tailspin in the last hour (of three) ""Pearl Harbor"" is the best piece of popular entertainment to come along in years for my money a much better heartbreaker thrillmaker and tear-tweaker than ""Titanic."" Some people - most of them professional moviegoers - will argue that its corny and predictable. I would counter-argue Thats the point. The movies greatest accomplishment after its extraordinary re-creation of the Day of Infamy is the brilliance with which it understands and integrates 40s movie tropes. Youve seen em before; youll see em again here the noble woman the two heroes who love her the end of a beautiful friendship the big battle the reconciliation under fire and the last sacrifice. Its the same old story but not a fight for love and glory Its a fight between love and glory really. Yeah okay it was better with Bogart and Bergman but everything was better with Bogart and Bergman. Our heroes have nice 40s names and cheekbones Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck the seasoned one) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett the beautiful one). Both look good in the 40s flyboy duds with leather A-2 jackets over khakis and Ray-Ban aviators and a cap scrunched nearly flat under earphones. Best pals from a hardscrabble Tennessee childhood theyre now hot young Air Corps studs P-40 Warhawk jocks out of a Long Island air base where they regularly play mock-chicken at 350 miles an hour 35 feet above the ground to the delight and admiration of the rest of the squadron. Remember the meet-cute of 40s movies? For ""Pearl Harbor"" someone - presumably screenwriter Randall (""Braveheart"") Wallace - came up with a lulu of a gag for this old-time ritual. Handsome Rafe meets beautiful naval nurse Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale who has the classic face of a 40s screen goddess) over the point of a hypodermic needle. He is not at that moment exactly putting his best face forward. She really gets his attention when she gives him three inches of booster shot where its always pasty white. Since it turns out he has already had that same shot and only came around again to meet her he promptly passes out from the double dose. Heck even I could get a girl that way. But though they have a magic night in the New York City of early 1941 (swing rules as do brassy nightclubs and bottles of bubbly) and though love is absolute and instant (as it always was in 40s movies) duty beckons. Hes already volunteered to go to England for a tour with the Eagle Squadron the Yank volunteer unit with the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain. Danny remains in the States and by the miracle of the motion pictures capacity to abbreviate time Rafe is swiftly in the cockpit of a slightly-used Spitfire jousting with the Hun Messerschmidts over the White Cliffs. He brings down the aces handful five. But the sixth smokes him and we see him sliding under the waves of the Channel. Is he dead? Was Victor Laszlo dead in ""Casablanca""? Am I giving away a secret? Yes if youre a moron. Meanwhile the movie widens. It flirts with but never commits to documentary style as it flits among a number of more or less historically accurate plot strands. The Japanese genius admiral and Harvard grad Isoroku Yamamoto (the great Formosan actor Mako turned into a leathery wizened Yoda of naval warfare) plots the attack on Pearl Harbor. In Washington code breakers led by ex-ghostbuster Dan Aykroyd attempt to crack the numeric jive of Japans secret radio chatter. President Franklin D. Roosevelt (brilliantly played by an unrecognizable Jon Voight) worries about the Pacific and Japanese intentions. Back at Pearl Harbor a black mess steward named Dorie Miller (Cuba Gooding Jr.) hates the fact that hes relegated to the galley of his battlewagon. In the main story meanwhile both Evelyns nurse unit and Dannys fighter squadron are transferred to Pearl and the easy living in that peaceful paradise under blue skies green palms and on white sandy beaches. Evelyn and Danny are so noble it will make you sick unless you once dreamed of Ingrid Bergman - so close so far away as you lit a butt and cursed the fact that of all the gin joints in the world she picked yours. Evelyn and Danny mourning Rafe and made hesitant by their guilt over what theyre feeling wait three full months before going goo-goo-eyed over each other. Here the movie gets moony and slack and many of you will be saying ""Send in the Zeros"" Of course Rafe miraculously rescued from the dead arrives in Pearl 24 hours before the Japanese and in that brief time the movie shunts through sequences of romantic betrayal jealousy anger anguish and all those High Emotions from ""Casablanca."" But theres a subtle rearrangement of the materials Its Rafe the Victor Laszlo substitute who gets to show Ricks rage and bitterness and cynicism. Rafe is crushed at what he views as treachery; Danny wanly tries to rationalize what really wasnt his fault after all; and Evelyn tries to decide which hunk is more to her taste a situation made more urgent by the bun in her oven. Just when you think all of this would play better in black-and-white the Japanese arrive to bring you back to the movies title. What follows is certainly the most spectacular hour of American film since the Normandy sequence in ""Ryan."" Of course what youre seeing was not created in the actual world not quite like this; were looking at some computerized constructions mated magically to a few big props in a big Baja tank. But not for a second can you believe its not real The Japanese planes swarm like insects buzzing low to the ground spewing tracers - they ping-ping-ping when they hit the ships - and dumping torpedoes and bombs. The camera in cyberspace conjures up some fantastic rides We cling to the tail fin of a Japanese 500-pounder sailing down toward the Arizona its silly little propeller fuse spinning loose like a childs toy as it rushes closer and closer to the big gray target below. We strafe with the fighters and watch their tracers arc out into space before us and rip their targets. The gigantic ships roll over like dying dinosaurs on the day of the big meteor spilling sailors by the hundreds into the boiling waters. Astonishing. And the movie bless its heart is quite decent to our opponents in that conflict the Japanese. You can feel restraint all the way through and if this is certainly market-driven the gentleness is still worthy of appreciation The Japanese are never personified in the old style and theres no money shot of grinning Oriental fiends cackling with raptors glee as they machine-gun sailors and theres no sense of Americans then paying them back in vengeful lead. Yet at the same time the unlovely word ""Jap"" is uttered promiscuously during the attack as it must have been in the real thing. So theres an effective balance between 01 decency and 41 accuracy. Director Michael Bay focuses on small moments of heroism to give focus to the slaughter That black mess steward ends up on a 20mm AA gun and splashes a bomber. Everybody behaves with a great deal of nobility and courage and in the hospital in a scorching searing scene those 40s-doll nurses get with the program and become dirty-faced heroines who live up to the terror inflicted upon them like the gals in ""So Proudly We Hail"" (1943). Of course even as the carnage continues in the harbor fighter pilots and former best buddies Rafe and Danny struggle through strafing runs to a satellite airfield and hung over and bleary-eyed in half-buttoned aloha shirts still in high-spat mode over the Evelyn issue manage to get aloft for a touch of retribution P-40 style. The movie really delivers this sortie with satisfying dramatic crunch The big Yank pursuit ships rumble through the air like forces of industrial might after the more agile but flimsier Japanese craft. What they hit they kill. This sequence reflects the actual flights that morning of two genuine American heroes George Welch and Ken Taylor who brought down seven Japanese planes exactly the number ascribed to Danny and Rafe. Alas the movie quickly squanders much of the goodwill it has accumulated in a unnecessary and unnecessarily protracted denouement where you have no choice but to rescind its poetic license. Its feeble but forgivable that Rafe could go from P-40s to Spitfires back to P-40s again without missing a beat because after all both were low-winged high performance fighter planes. But somehow fighter jock Rafe as well as pal Danny and the rest of the squadron from Pearl end up flying B-25s off the aircraft carrier Hornet in a hurried version of Jimmy Doolittles reprisal raid on Tokyo and several other Japanese cities in April 1942. This seems to be where ""Pearl Harbor"" abandons the 40s and leaps headlong into our own dismal century. You could say the hammer has fallen or is it the Bruckheimer after producer and vulgarian Jerry Bruckheimer perpetrator of such monstrosities as ""Armageddon"" and ""The Rock"" (both of which Bay also directed quite loudly). Its not merely the nauseating spectacle of a paunchy double-chinned liberal blowhard like Alec Baldwin playing the rock-solid cue-ball-bald conservative war hero Doolittle its that the Bruckheimer spirit of giganticism has to be indulged. The raid on Tokyo was a fabulous uplift for a beleaguered nation. But guess what folks They dropped about 16 bombs and blew up a few outhouses. The old chestnut ""30 Seconds Over Tokyo"" (1944) does a much more fair version of the raid; in the overexaggerated stylizations of 01 the bombs rain down on Tokyo and devastate blocks and blocks of factories. Then as all the Tokyo raiders did Rafe and Danny in separate bombers crash-land in China and immediately begin a ridiculous gunfight with Japanese soldiers. Suddenly its ""The Wild Bunch"" with .45s blazing away and grenades blowing up and men dying like flies and the problem between Danny and Rafe solved in the most cowardly way possible a way Bogie never would have countenanced. As long as ""Pearl Harbor"" stays in the past its perfect; when it wretchedly changes gears in the late going it becomes the wrong kind of same old story Hollywood stupidity and callowness writ large across the sky.""Pearl Harbor"" (180 minutes) is rated PG-13 for scenes of intense battle though not of the graphic nature of ""Saving Private Ryan.""

The net result of this mighty effort is perhaps predictable near total inconsequence. Notice please that we didnt say Pearl Harbor is a totally terrible movie. It is watchable in a dim beclouded sort of way. But one rather thinks that a film trying to recapture the romantic raptures and ruptures people suffered as World War II shattered their normality needs to impart a sense of their desperation as tragic possibility suddenly loomed in their lives. This though is precisely what this carefully oiled and polished machine lacks. Its problem lies principally but not exclusively with its love story. The movies makers--producer Jerry Bruckheimer director Michael Bay and writer Randall Wallace--looked unashamedly at Titanic and found its heated romance the perfect device to narrow the distance between a great historical happening and todays essentially antihistorical audience. Pearl Harbor thus spends a lot of time with Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) boyhood pals who grow up to be hot pilots falling in love with the same woman a Navy nurse named Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale). Rafe is first in line but when he goes missing and is presumed dead in the Battle of Britain Danny who lands up at Pearl Harbor with Evelyn fills in for him--rather too successfully. Evelyn is pregnant when Rafe comes back from the dead just in time for Dec. 7. It requires the Doolittle raid on Japan four months later to resolve this romantic conundrum by knocking a corner off the triangle. It requires a lot of patience for an audience to sit through the dithering. Theyre nice kids and all that but they dont exactly claw madly at one another. Its as if they know that someday theyre going to be part of ""the Greatest Generation"" and dont want to offend Tom Brokaw. Besides megahistory and personal history never integrate here. That leaves Cuba Gooding Jr. playing a real historical figure Dorie Miller for us to root for. Miller was a cook who though untrained manned a gun and may have shot down one or two Japanese planes. But his character is merely sketched into the narrative and the entire assault on Pearl has a curiously abstract air about it. The bodies fly spectacularly when the Arizona is hit but we dont know thus care about the victims. Its possible this is a story you cant tell from the bottom up. Maybe the real Pearl Harbor tragedy took place in Tokyo and Washington--bunches of old guys sitting around talking erroneous geopolitics. They play small roles here and you cant expect anyone to make a big-time movie about their murmured miscalculations. You do however have a right to the kind of high passionate drama thats missing from this movie.

Producer Jerry Bruckheimer is famed for uselessly blowing up things on screen but at least history is on his side in this 140 million re-teaming with director Michael Bay of The Rock and Armageddon. Two or more of Pearls three hours are sputtering spectacle but the movies budget is well spent on the Japanese attack -- if youre not put off by a horrific historical event passed off as a summer blockbuster showpiece.

The most kinetic footage comes from the enemy pilots perspective including shots from the bombs eye-view. For many the rest of the movie will play like a view of a bomb even if box office success seems assured. Lethargic and directionless for 85 minutes the beginning has flyboy Ben Affleck looking beat and distracted battling best buddy (bland Josh Hartnett) over a nurse played by the usually appealing Kate Beckinsale. Here shes inexplicably submerged -- like her hospital colleagues -- under heaps of tarty makeup that even actresses of the era didnt wear. And aside from an excellent turn by Jon Voight as FDR and a decent one by Alec Baldwin as Lt. Col. James Doolittle the supporting characters are missing in action. Cuba Gooding Jr. (as a company cook turned hero) is segregated from the rest of the movie. The other GIs are standard-issue cliches getting no help from stilted dialogue penned by surprisingly Bravehearts Randall Wallace. Bay sets up what promise to be major scenes (a British Eagle Squadron battle a night out at a lavish club) -- only to quickly drop them. And its hard to believe an hour and a half can go by in a peacetime military setting without anything funny happening. Pearl Harbor is the summer movie everyone wants to see and I did too. Its an extravaganza worth seeing once -- and maybe later on DVD. Then you can watch the attack and zap the remote-control signal over the so-called story -- again and again from here to eternity.

"Up Where We Belong Slate Sign In Sign Up Up Where We Belong Up Where We Belong Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 25 2001 830 PM Up Where We Belong Pearl Harbor is Top Gun with period costumes. By David Edelstein Pearl Harbor Directed by Michael Bay Buena Vista The rout of the U.S. military in the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor might seem a downbeat subject for a summer blockbuster but a glance at the names of the director (Michael Bay of Armageddon [1998]) and producer (Jerry Bruckheimer of Top Gun [1986] etc.) clues you in at the start that this wont be a grim saga of chaos incompetence and possible chicanery It will be an inspiring testament to the indomitability of the American spirit--with killer FX. The FX part isnt so parenthetical. One of the biggest selling points of Pearl Harbor--a movie thats nothing but selling points--is that it portrays this fabled American disaster with so much money and state-of-the-art technical wizardry and sheer brawny confidence in its own commercial savvy that you never really think about blaming anyone for the tragedy of Dec. 7 1941. Its more an occasion to sniffle preen pat yourself on the back and then go forth and barbecue--smug in the knowledge that American movies rule the world. Advertisement So whats so bad about wallowing in our own potency? And why not bring back World War II as an occasion for showing off? It was after all the last romantic U.S. battle the one in which no one--at least no one after Pearl Harbor--disputed that we belonged in the global fight against imperial fascism. Why not clear away the last persistent vapors of post-Vietnam self-hatred? Why not eschew scapegoats (or for that matter historical causes) when the most important thing is paying tribute to our homegrown top guns (here played by Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) as they valorously leap into their ill-equipped fighter planes and--led by the irascible Jimmy Doolittle (Alec Baldwin)--swoop down on Tokyo to get a piece of their own back? It was the Japs who drew first blood with their steely amoral precision Why not an old-fashioned guts-and-glory war picture that shows Americans winning with heart? The answers to those questions depend of course on your view of movies whether you believe they owe it to their subjects (and their audiences) to illuminate as well as entertain or whether you basically go to see handsome men kissing pretty girls and stuff blowing up. From my middling perspective (i.e. I like to be illuminated while stuff is blowing up) I found Pearl Harbor annoying but not excruciating--even at three hours its less assaultive than either The Mummy Returns or Moulin Rouge. There are funny meet-cute scenes with Afflecks Rafe and Kate Beckinsales Evelyn a redoubtable Florence Nightingale type. (I always go for those bits where swaggering jocks get nailed in the butt by not-so-subtly gloating nurses.) The dogfights are fast and thrillingly fluid; and thanks to computers colossal explosions can now be rendered as colossal explosions with limbs and torsos hurtling toward the camera. (Many brave pixels died for this movie.) The smoke that billows from the devastated battleships is a deep nightmarish black--stunning against the slate-gray water and bright orange flames. Critics like to pick on Michael Bay but I think he has more film sense than Tony and Ridley Scott put together. His battle montages are more than disparate bursts of energy haphazardly blended--they make linear sense. And he knows how to direct comedy--intentionally I mean. All the same Bay is very much a creature of Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer (yes Simpson is dead but his aesthetic lingers like a chemical spill) which means that Pearl Harbor is essentially Top Gun with period costumes and the campy homoeroticism in check. Theres no variety in the long central bombardment sequence and the rest of the time the corny lyricism can narcotize you the creamy color-coordinated infirmary; the trains that send up cumulous clouds of steam that catch the light and bathe the parting lovers in blue; the Japanese bombers that fly past golden-haired boys releasing baseballs; the soldiers who triumphantly throw up their arms in slow motion. Bay isnt trying to make the movie look real He wants you to leap into the pages of Life magazine with its satiny glamour and broad sociological messages. But weve already seen and snickered at that vision of history--in 1941 (1979) Steven Spielberg was already parodying what Pearl Harbor plays straight. This time however theres a love triangle to anchor the boom-and-whoosh. The heroes Rafe and Danny (Hartnett) are childhood buddies who train to be flyers together--theyre mavericks hot dogs. They piss off their instructor Doolittle but they impress him too. (Baldwin who clicks his choppers to show manly relish is one step away from a Saturday Night Live turn--how did he keep a straight face?) Rafe tumbles hard for Florence (I mean Evelyn) which is great until he takes off for England to aid the RAF (Rafe in the RAF hmmm ...) and Danny and Evelyn wind up side-by-side in Pearl Harbor. (Skip the rest of this paragraph if you dont already know what happens and cant--duh--predict it.) The buddieship of course is threatened by a woman but its not as if anyone cheats on anyone. See Evelyn thinks the love of her life--whom she has only known for a month incidentally--has been killed. The grief-stricken Danny reaches out to her as a way of keeping his best friend close (maybe also because shes unbelievably gorgeous). So Rafe turns out to be the perfect crimeless victim--just as the United States is a crimeless victim when the Japanese start bombing. Its really important for Rafe and Danny to overcome their divisions if they want to defeat the enemy--to put the country before themselves just as Evelyn puts Dannys child (the future) before herself in deciding between these exemplary soldiers. With young people like this how can the United States possibly lose? Advertisement Affleck is leaner and more chiseled here and hes doing his best to shed his what-me-worry preppy smugness--even though thats the most distinctive thing about him. His lack of histrionic range actually helps He dries the role out and gives it some edge. Hes certainly a more interesting match for Beckinsale than Josh Hartnett whose features are too incestuously similar to hers. (Theyre beautiful features theyre just from the same earnest button-eyed mold.) Becksinsale has to shout things like ""Everybody to the hospital"" while ducking shrapnel but at least she looks great in the clothes. The archetypal Simpson-Bruckheimer girl is tall and sultry and swishes toward the camera in semi-slow-motion--slow enough to tantalize the audience but not so slow as to reduce it to puddles of mirth. Compared to Kelly McGillis as a flight instructor and a 22-year-old Nicole Kidman as a renowned neurosurgeon Beckinsales nurse is gritty realism. (Im putting in parentheses Cuba Gooding Jr.--who plays an African-American soldier confined to food service until the Japanese attack and who magically fulfills his destiny behind a machine gun--because thats where the movie puts him.) How are the Japanese portrayed? With a painstaking formality. No sadistic Japs--just brave stoic automatons. Their motives are never entirely clear but then neither are the American governments. Pearl Harbor ignores the work of John Toland (Infamy) and other historians whove made a plausible case that FDR knew of the imminent attack on the Hawaiian base but didnt warn its commanders for fear that the Japanese fleet would turn back. The theory which I find convincing is that FDR wanted the surprise attack to happen that he thought (correctly) it would induce the American electorate--at that point split into fierce camps of isolationists and interventionists--to endorse prompt American participation in a war that was already eating up Europe and parts of the South Pacific. No one thinks FDR had any idea of the efficiency of the Japanese attack and the scale of the destruction--that part was a genuine surprise. Although Pearl Harbor goes out of its way to avoid blaming Rear Adm. Husband Kimmel and Maj. Gen. Walter Short--the whipping boys of the day--it doesnt offer much in the way of analysis and FDR (tenderly impersonated by Jon Voight) is portrayed as a heroically indignant innocent. You end up thinking that if the military brass had just listened to ace code-breaker Thurman (Dan Aykroyd) who had a feeling in his sizable gut that those Japs were up to something the bombings wouldnt have found so many people in bed or on the golf course. Unmentioned in the film are the volcanic recriminations that raged in the invasions aftermath The filmmakers are too concerned with getting Affleck and Hartnett into bombers to kick some Japanese butt. When you jeer a sentimental flag-waving war picture like Pearl Harbor a lot of people think youre being disrespectful to the very idea of military heroism; but whats unclear is how rooting for a bunch of narcissistic actors who puff out their chests and risk the lives of their stunt doubles is a meaningful way of honoring the men and women who actually fought and died in battle. The movie is not the event. Before he turned himself into a musclebound poster-boy for martyred POWs Sylvester Stallone sat out the Vietnam War to teach skiing to rich girls at a Swiss boarding school--yet if you make fun of Rambo youre not seen as razzing an egomaniacal opportunist youre seen as slandering our brave boys. If you say that Pearl Harbor is bloated mind-numbing schlock youre not attacking corporate pandering at its most egregious youre showing contempt for Memorial Day. In fact I have too much respect for Memorial Day to want to celebrate it by proclaiming the puerile bromides of Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay. Correction Kaleil Isaza Tuzman e-mails to say that he and his partner Tom Herman do not have a direct financial stake in earnings of the documentary Startup.com.

Bombs dive from Japanese planes piercing the hulls of U.S. ships forcing the vessels to heave and pirouette for a moment before blowing apart. Japanese fighter pilots go through elaborate silent rituals - offering toasts to their planes and carefully drawing white cloth bands across their foreheads before climbing into their white aircraft. Dozens of fighter planes bear down on a woman hanging her laundry before veering toward their targets. She ducks and winces shocked at such a violation of her Sunday duties. ""Pearl Harbor""   With Ben Affleck Josh Hartnett Kate Beckinsale Alec Baldwin. Directed by Michael Bay from a screenplay by Randall Wallace. Rated PG-13 for sustained intense war sequences images of wounded people brief sensuality and some language. 173 minutes. Various theaters. There are many more remarkable shots and images tossed at us during the 20 or so most intense minutes of director Michael Bay and producer Jerry Bruckheimers new movie. Ships fill with water turn over and begin to sink. Huge steel superstructures crumble and crash into the water. We cringe at these moments; at the sight of dozens of aircraft dropping through Hawaiian clouds toward the naval base below we suck in our breath. These scenes encompass only a fraction of the movie though. ""Pearl Harbor"" is a three-hour epic a long puffed-up tale of love and heroism that if separated from the invasion sequence would be a snore at best. Snip away that brilliant bit of techno wizardry and ""Pearl Harbor"" reveals itself as a clunky love story with cardboard characters poor dialogue and little besides schmaltzy music to carry us to the next explosion. The movie begins with a dose of beautifully filmed cheddar. Two young boys (its 1923 Tennessee) play in a broken old cropduster pretending to shoot German aces out of the sky. Around them are amber waves of grain and if the camera were to pan out enough maybe purple mountains too. One boy after shooting an imaginary foe says ""Land of the free"" which the other answers with ""Home of the brave."" Here we go. Jerked forward to 1940 and Long Islands Mitchell Field (now a mall) the two have grown into cocky fighter pilots. One of them Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) gets busted for a stunt and is scolded by his commanding officer James Doolittle (Alec Baldwin). As Doolittle Baldwin gets to say things like ""You remind me of myself 15 years ago."" He then sends Rafe off to England to help the British fight the Germans. Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) Rafes buddy stays behind and gets transferred to Hawaii a place where nothing ever happens. In case youre wondering the invasion of Pearl Harbor comes more than 90 minutes into the film. Until then were left to baby-sit not just Rafe and Danny but their squadron mates a randy group of nurses and Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale) Rafes radiant lover. Rafe goes off to England and Evelyn pledges her undying love. With Rafe gone Evelyn and Danny fall in love. Its OK because they waited three months. But its not OK because theyre so boring. There are no bad guys in this movie - and we all know bad guys are more fun. Evelyn and Danny cant be blamed since Rafe is gone; the Japanese are off the hook because we cut off their supply for oil. What were left with is a lack of passion. Our blood runs hot for the bombs and explosions not the people. During the huge battle sequence Bay takes us away from the carnage to show Danny and Rafe (hes back) shooting down Japanese fighters and acting like Maverick and Goose from ""Top Gun."" On one of the ships Cuba Gooding Jr. muddles around as the one black person in the movie with any lines. Hes tough and good and mourns the loss of his captain (who would only let him be a cook but commented favorably on his boxing prowess) in a moment that has a whiff of the Old South. Goodings character may be based on a real person but you wouldnt know it. None of the principal actors give great performances; with little to work with they stand around as if posing for war posters. And word is the filmmakers tacked on a 40-minute gung-ho ending because leaving us with Pearl Harbor would have been a serious bummer. Bay takes the easy way out with this movie shunning the real pain of the attack to concentrate on the shallow feelings of his stars. At the end over stirring music Evelyn speaks of how tough it all was. ""But through the trial"" she says ""we overcame."" Yes my dear we did. But barely.

Starring Ben Affleck Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale. Directed by Michael Bay. (VHS and DVD. PG-13. 180 minutes.) ""Pearl Harbor"" is about a passionate love triangle that gets interrupted when enemy planes bomb an isolated military outpost. Directed by Michael Bay the picture has less to do with Americas entry into World War II than it does with the romantic concerns of a pretty nurse (played by Kate Beckinsale) torn between men played by Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett. Yet any film that maintains interest for three solid hours is by definition some kind of good movie. Thats ""Pearl Harbor"" -- some kind of good movie. It has more cliches than fireballs. But it expertly capitalizes on the emotional associations Americans have with Pearl Harbor and renders the battle scenes with an excellence that goes beyond proficiency and into the realm of art. Audiences will find themselves swept away even if they were snickering moments before. Still theres plenty to snicker about. This is the kind of movie where if someone throws a punch it turns into a bar fight. If a woman throws up shes pregnant. If someone leaves for war the lover is late getting to the train. People carouse and drink on Dec. 6 1941 as if theyre in ""From Here to Eternity."" And an officer actually utters the line ""You know we may lose this battle but we will win this war."" Theres one sex scene and its hard to know what to make of it. It takes place to the accompaniment of a chorus singing ""Ooh ooh ooh"" on the soundtrack. Perhaps that means the angels approve. Like life itself then ""Pearl Harbor"" could be described as a comedy for those who think and a tragedy for those who feel. But unlike life ""Pearl Harbor"" was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and Bruckheimers movies inevitably force viewers to feel something. When the Japanese bombers take off flying above the clouds on a beautiful day theres no escaping the sense of historical moment. We dont just know but feel that America is leaving one world and entering another. The ferocity of the attack is daunting to behold. The explosions rendered by computer dont look real so much as hyper-real as though emanating from a collective American nightmare. Bay even capsizes a ship calling to mind ""Titanic"" the film ""Pearl Harbor"" most resembles. The truth is people who loved ""Titanic"" will probably only like ""Pearl Harbor"" while people who hated ""Titanic"" just might enjoy ""Pearl Harbor."" This one is neither as good nor as bad as ""Titanic."" Its less corny less romantic and takes fewer chances but in the end it gets the job done. Advisory This film contains lots of military violence and a modest sex scene.

Always will we remember the character of the onslaught against us. Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News Movies based on historical events often play fast and loose with the facts -- it comes with the territory and most moviegoers who have ever watched an Elizabethan costume drama or a World War II battle picture on Saturday afternoon TV know it instinctively. But even viewed through that gaping and forgiving lens the new breed of histortainment -- pictures like last summers ""The Patriot"" and now ""Pearl Harbor"" -- invites just one appropriate response jaw-dropping incredulity. Roland Emmerichs ""The Patriot"" its repeated unfurling of a beat-up and tattered Old Glory notwithstanding wasnt about patriotism at all but about one individuals relentless quest for revenge (think Charles Bronson with a pigtail). We also got to see a young soldiers head get blown clean off by a cannonball. What was the war like Daddy in the days before computer graphics? Now ""The Patriot"" has a spiritual bookend in Michael Bays ""Pearl Harbor."" The filmmakers claim theyve been historically accurate but theyve done ""The Patriot"" one better Theyve rendered accuracy beside the point. ""Pearl Harbor"" is just a three-hour epic loaded with loud guns and explosions for the boys and extraordinary swing-era dresses for the girls. Romance drama pathos wrenching decisions ironclad ships blown to shards charred and bloody limbs -- you name it ""Pearl Harbor"" has it. Craftily shot by John Schwartzman who serves up images like lovers shrouded in train mist as if they were menu items its a movie steeped in borrowed nostalgia. Its rousing in completely artificial terms. The heroism of ""Pearl Harbor"" is unsullied by anything as mundane as patriotism -- its hard to figure out if Bay and screenwriter Randall Wallace (""Braveheart"" ""The Man in the Iron Mask"") think flag-waving is uncool or in bad taste or both. In any event there are no Spielbergian ""Saving Private Ryan""-type speeches to drag down the action which would be a plus if only it werent so obvious that the movie has muscles for brains. Subtlety isnt Bays strong suit. ""Pearl Harbor"" is all lovin and kissin and brave fighter pilots when its not screaming men being blasted from their ships. Wallaces narrative uses the bombing of Pearl Harbor as a backdrop for the story of the deep and lasting friendship between Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) who have been buddies since they were little squirts. An early flashback shows us Dannys father leading the young boy away by the ear after he and Rafe have inadvertently taken a joyride in Rafes daddys crop-dusting plane. The two boys grow up to become fighter pilots natch. Rafe the more assertive of the two gets a chance to go off with the British Eagle Squadron. He leaves behind Danny whos sullenly resigned to being separated from his friend and his nurse girlfriend Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) who swears lifelong love. The rest of the movie meshes the story of the two guys and the gal who eventually reunite at Pearl Harbor with the unfolding of the Japanese plot to blow the whole thing to smithereens. In an effort to sprinkle around some early 21st century multiculti feel-good vibes ""Pearl Harbor"" takes great pains to humanize the Japanese. They had good reason to sneak up and drop tons of ammo on a bunch of sleeping soldiers -- who knew? In the movies vision the commander in chief of the Imperial Japanese Navy Adm. Isoroku Yamamoto (martial arts master Mako) hesitates before he tells his troops that they will ""annihilate the Pacific Fleet in a single attack"" glancing away from them to take in the happy sight of a group of children flying kites in the sun. Later praised by one of his underlings for his glittering strategy he remarks gravely ""A brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war."" But hey in Bays world war like shit happens -- no biggie.The first half of ""Pearl Harbor"" zips along nicely It may be ridiculous but at least its not boring. Once theyre stationed at Pearl Harbor Danny and his pals swagger around the base in their boffo Hawaiian shirts vaguely apprehensive about the possibility of war but not particularly fazed by it. There are lots of pretty nurses around and the boys revel in having so many skirts to chase. Long before the bombs start to drop the only weapons the guys need to worry about are the long vaccination needles the nurses poke ruthlessly into their butts turning the whole routine into a sassy mating ritual. You Might Also Like But theres trauma brewing amid all the romantic folderol. Danny Rafe and Evelyn dont realize that theyre about to face an unexpected personal trial and back in Washington a naval captain (Dan Aykroyd) tries to warn his colleagues that the Japanese are poised to ""hit us where it hurts us the most."" When asked why he replies sensibly ""Well its what I would do."" But no one listens of course and before long Japanese pilots have started strapping on their leather helmets and dropping bad attitude all over Pearl Harbor. (Whenever the Japanese warriors appear Hans Zimmers score alerts us to their exoticism with a heavy drumbeat borrowed from taiko.) By the movies end we have the Japanese military strategy committed firmly to memory. The characters speak in Japanese and over and over again were reminded of their intent in subtitles ""If we achieve surprise the Americans will offer little resistance."" Before long the bomb-dropping sequence becomes a muddle of fireballs and billowing smoke of doctors and nurses rushing about in panic of screaming men sliding off the decks of upended vessels. Just when it should start to get exciting ""Pearl Harbor"" becomes numbingly routine. Danny and Rafe hop into planes and start fighting back cheering each other on with lines like ""Hoo Good shooting boys"" -- proof that ""Pearl Harbor"" deep in its heart really only wants to be ""Top Gun"" and thats good enough. Even with all the grand dramatic flourishes of ""Pearl Harbor"" few of the actors make any significant impression. Affleck has the right jaw for a World War II fighter pilot -- upon hearing bad news he sets it into a cartoonishly hard line a perfect caricature of the masculine determination you see on those period recruitment posters. But most of the time he seems to be playing a version of stolid masculinity that saps the charm right out of him. Hartnett with his boyish squint is too laid-back to register as much of a presence. And Beckinsale with her creamy pale skin and wine-berry lips is lovely to look at -- she just never throws off any sparks. (More appealing as much for her looks as for any of her lines is former fashion model James King Her profile with its upturned snub nose looks as if it were lifted from a vintage Tillie the Toiler comic strip.) Almost every actor here many of whom have been dazzling in other performances seems to have been swept out to sea by the allegedly huge sweeping vision of ""Pearl Harbor."" Jon Voight is an earnest and gently heroic Franklin Delano Roosevelt but his presence doesnt linger in ones memory. And Cuba Gooding Jr. as real-life hero Doris ""Dorie"" Miller a Navy cook who jumps in to man a machine gun during the attack has a role that asks nothing more of him than to look demoralized by his lowly station and then to glow with quiet triumph in his restored masculinity. Hes too good an actor to waste his time with such comic-book heroics. With ""Pearl Harbor"" Bay clearly wanted to make a picture more serious and more significant than ""Armageddon."" Theres no getting around the fact that the subject matter is inherently grave especially considering that quite a few Pearl Harbor survivors are still with us. But ""Pearl Harbor"" is such a bloodless picture that it neither insults nor honors the memory of these soldiers. Less offensive than James Camerons loathsomely calculating ""Titanic"" its nonetheless cut from the same fabric using its clever high-tech tools to dress up a marketing event as real-life history. (It will be interesting to see how ""Pearl Harbor"" plays in Japan where ""Titanic"" was such a huge hit; Touchstone has announced that it will revise the picture for release in Japan and Germany in an effort to avoid offending audiences in those countries -- evidence that its not such a small world after all.) But even if you simply take it on its own terms ""Pearl Harbor"" is exactly the kind of prestige project youd expect from a director like Bay hitting all its targets with plodding precision and never once achieving surprise. Its as if hed heard the term ""History Channel"" and interpreted it to mean deep old rut. Bay digs in and just keeps shoveling.

Running time 183 minutes. Rated PG-13 (sanitized violence and gore). At the Empire the Lincoln Square the Union Square others. ----- YES the 40-minute attack sequence in ""Pearl Harbor"" is as spectacular as you could imagine - but come prepared to suffer through hours of soggy corny predictable and interminable romantic drama. A 140 million budget has bought a lot of eye candy - the sweeping views of Pearl Harbor as Japanese planes torpedo the massed battleships is a particularly effective spectacle. Seamlessly blending live-action stunts and computer-generated effects ace action director Michael Bay and uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer deliver a nonstop barrage of bombs bullets and explosions in a rah-rah tribute to the Greatest Generation. Unfortunately the bulk of the three-hour epic is third-rate schmaltz that pays only lip service to history. The screenplay attributed to Randall Wallace (""Braveheart"") tiresomely recycles every two-guys-and-a-gal cliche imaginable focusing on pals Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) Army flyers stationed in Honolulu. Rafe meets Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) an improbably glamorous nurse while shes administering an injection into his rump. He gets to first base but its 1940 and their romance is interrupted when he volunteers to fight the Nazis with the RAF. When Rafe is presumed missing in action Danny consoles Evelyn and a whole lot more. Rafe of course shows up alive in Honolulu on the eve of the attack which has been telegraphed with increasingly ominous inserts of a grave-looking Japanese admiral (Mako) a grave-looking U.S. intelligence officer (Dan Aykroyd) - and President Roosevelt who as ridiculously impersonated by Jon Voight looks like he just had a makeover at Madame Tussauds. Rafe and Danny duke it out but then - luckily for dozing audience members - the bombs start dropping as Hans Zimmers generic blockbuster score swells in the background. Our heroes take to the skies while Evelyn bravely copes with the carnage at the hospital (very heavily diffused and edited to secure a lucrative PG-13 rating). Rafe and Danny do so well at shooting down Japanese planes that theyre recruited by Col. Jimmy Doolittle (a fatuous Alec Baldwin) for his raid on Tokyo. Never mind that theyre trained as fighter not bomber pilots; its an opportunity to simultaneously resolve Evelyns romantic problems and provide an upbeat ending. Working at a less frenetic pace than in his previous collaborations with Bruckheimer (""Armageddon"" and ""The Rock"") Bay doesnt exactly encourage his actors to flesh out the cardboard characters. Affleck is cocky; Hartnett pained; Beckinsale radiant. Cuba Gooding Jr. makes little more than a token appearance as a black Navy cook who shoots down a Japanese plane during the attack. While it liberally borrows from a great many other movies ""Pearl Harbor"" is most clearly modeled on ""Titanic"" to the point where Bay turns the battleship USS Arizona into another Titanic complete with elaborate sinking shots that should have James Cameron demanding royalties. ""Pearl Harbor"" alas hasnt the chemistry between the leads or the convincing period detail that made ""Titanic"" a transporting experience. Its loaded with wince-inducing anachronistic dialogue and such historically dubious sights as the polio-stricken FDR rising to his feet to demand the Tokyo bombing. This last bit actually got applause at the screening I attended. But my faith in humanity was restored when the same audience roared with laughter during a big dramatic scene when Evelyn recapped some plot points - and complained that ""and then all this happened."" All this was the Japanese attack which at best elevates a truly Tora Tora terrible movie into a mediocre one.

(I know you dont have to tell me Its only a movie.) ""Pearl Harbor"" got made on the basest level because its the story of a planet-shaking historical event in which stuff blowed up real good. But the film while just about programmed to rule at the box office isnt a cheesy and decadent fast cut entertainment; the surprise is that it may be the squarest event movie in years. An indulgently paced three hours the picture is nearly painstaking in its traditionalism a tale of love war and valor in which nostalgia for ""simpler times"" gets mashed together almost fetishistically with nostalgia for old movies and for the spirit of knightly self sacrifice during World War II that ""Saving Private Ryan"" and Tom Brokaw helped make fashionable again. When the Japanese roughly 90 minutes in commence their surprise attack on the U.S. Naval fleet at Pearl Harbor Bays staging is spectacular but also honorable in its scary hurtling exactitude. Buzzing fighter planes darken the early morning Hawaiian sky shooting past a sandlot baseball game and a woman stringing her clothesline the bombers as ominous as the flying monkeys in ""The Wizard of Oz."" There are startling point of view shots of torpedoes dropping into the water and speeding toward their targets and though Bay visualizes it all with a minimum of graphic carnage he invites us to register the terror of the men standing helplessly on deck the horrifying split second deliverance as bodies go flying and explosions reduce entire battleships to liquid walls of collapsing metal. I doubt that any studio system picture - or for that matter one made during the 70s - could have summoned the shocking vastness of the human devastation that occurred on Dec. 7 1941 with the poetic immediacy of ""Pearl Harbor."" Ben Affleck has the right keen spirit to play a fearless romantic flyboy but in a role that might have been designed for Gary Cooper Tyrone Power and James Stewart combined he never quite transcends his contempo allure to conjure the gravity the private inner space that would allow us to connect with the quiet heart of Rafes daredevil nobility. Affleck does however strike sparks with the avid eyed ruby lipped Kate Beckinsale the rare actress whose intelligence gives her a sensual bloom; shes like Parker Posey without irony. The fusion of romance and historical cataclysm was obviously inspired by ""Titanic"" but in that impassioned saga the disaster enlarged and deepened the love story; what would have been a tremulous teenage fling became timeless precisely because it was frozen in time. In ""Pearl Harbor"" disaster dwarfs the lives of the people around it and so we sit through much of the inflated story knowing that the film in essence is killing time.

Pearl Harbor Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2001) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/pearl-harbor-2001,200,pearlharbor24,pearlharbor,rogerebert

(Touchstone) When you assume battle stations for ""Pearl Harbor"" make sure you sit near the aisle. Youve got three hours to withstand and only about half of it is war. This is definitely a two-bathroom visit movie. Its not the length that makes a movie good or bad. Its the pacing. Some three-hour movies like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" just glide by. But movies like ""Pearl Harbor"" drag along because they . . . take . . . their . . . time . . . about . . . everything. Put it this way When a Japanese military officer reports that ""the task force"" is 320 miles north of Pearl Harbor were one hour and 20 minutes into the movie. By then youre ready to bomb something yourself. Perhaps they should have called this ""Bore-a Bore-a Bore-a."" Incidentally although this Walt Disney movie is based inspired and even partially informed by a real event referred to as Pearl Harbor the movie is actually based on the movies ""Top Gun"" ""Titanic"" and ""Saving Private Ryan."" Dont get confused. And dont be worried about emotional intensity. Its going to take a special effort on your part (probably informed by firsthand wartime experience in World War II) to actually appreciate the emotional impact of what happened on Dec. 7 1941. ""Pearl Harbor""-the-movie produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay (also the director) doesnt evoke that time so much as turn it into a pre-Fourth of July fireworks show. The movies emotional impact is not helped by the characters. By the time the Japanese are blowing ships out of the water we have met (and already become sick of) our blandly delineated sweethearts flying-crazy pilot Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and intelligent dedicated nurse Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale). We have also observed the lifelong friendship between Rafe and his pal Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett). The movie starts with Rafe and Danny as kids sitting in a motionless crop duster plane pretending to shoot enemy planes. Some two hours later theyll be mounting the American counterattack against the Japanese. ""Danny lets play some chicken with these Jap suckers"" yells Rafe. In what amounts to a superfluous first hour Rafe desperate for military action in pre-Pearl Harbor days volunteers for the Royal Air Force. Suddenly hes missing leaving Evelyn and Danny to pick up the pieces and each other. Why waste time worrying if hell reappear in time for Pearl Harbor as well as a romantic dogfight with Danny? Hes Ben Affleck the movies top-billed player. Theres more to this so-so movie including a completely formulaic subplot starring Cuba Gooding Jr. as a ships cook who boxes and machine-guns his way to r-e-s-p-e-c-t (loosely based on a real person Doris ""Dorie"" Miller) and Hans Zimmers relentlessly syrupy score. But lets cut to the chase those central 40 minutes of blitzkrieg special effects. Isnt that why people will be lining the block? My take The visuals are well done but not mind-blowingly memorable. It would take a director far more gifted than Bay to outdo James Cameron in ""Titanic."" Perhaps intimidated by this Bay gives us many scenes featuring marooned men in the water and many others stuck inside majestic sinking hulls. And when the Japanese planes strafe those men he goes underwater - like Steven Spielberg did in ""Saving Private Ryan"" - to show the cool glossy white trajectories the tracer bullets make underwater. Obviously imitation will get you everywhere. ""Pearl Harbor""(PG-13 183 minutes) - Contains war carnage and some strong language.

"The Day the World Shattered - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovie Review The Day the World ShatteredWith an immense cast and stunning effects Pearl Harbor vividly evokes an era of American innocence and the explosive moment that abruptly ended it.May 25 2001|KEVIN THOMAS | TIMES STAFF WRITER ""Pearl Harbor"" has a superb reenactment of Japans Dec. 7 1941 bombing of a sizable portion of the U.S. Pacific fleet in Honolulu an engaging love story and a remarkable evocation of a time when Americans virtually overnight pulled together to begin the grueling process of turning a military catastrophe into eventual triumph.The films immense cast and crew headed by director Michael Bay writer Randall Wallace and stars Ben Affleck Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale blend artistry and technology to create a blockbuster entertainment that has passion valor and tremendous action. Its combination of authentic aircraft and ships stunt work and special effects re-creates the bombing in all its precise ferocity and immense scale. And despite its scale ""Pearl Harbor"" has a brisk pace that makes this three-hour war epic seem like half that time.The film is sustained by a grand theme innocence lost. It suggests that the innocence that fired the unhesitating bravery and self-sacrifice of the American people in battle as well as the home front carried with it an ignorance that allowed the U.S. to underestimate Japans military power and determination.President Franklin D. Roosevelts admission of the mistake of ""regarding the enemy as inferior"" carries with it an implied acknowledgment of racist attitudes many Americans held toward the Japanese at that time. Its the same innocence that allows Afflecks Rafe to be crushed to discover that after he is reported killed in action his best friend Danny (Hartnett) and his fiancee Evelyn (Beckinsale) a Navy nurse have fallen in love.The filmmakers perspective of six decades recognizes that the stirring words of FDR and Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle could be spoken unself-consciously and that patriotism was a matter of unabashed pride. The passing of time also frees the filmmakers from the jingoism so characteristic of so many Hollywood World War II movies. ""Pearl Harbor"" leaves the impression that America paid for victory in a loss of innocence that was inevitable an invaluable lesson that we are always in the process of learning.""Pearl Harbor"" is also self-aware and honest in its heart-tugging. It takes us back to a simpler time when ordinary people were more sharing than competitive a time when American society for all its inequities and injustices was for many people a time of less loneliness alienation self-absorption and cynicism. This makes ""Pearl Harbor"" especially moving for those of us old enough to have heard FDR proclaim Dec. 7 ""a date which will live in infamy"" even if we were in kindergarten at the time.The first of the films deft touches occurs right at the start. Young Danny and Rafe are Tennessee farm boys back in 1923 and caught up in fantasies of World War I aerial warfare. They get Dannys fathers crop duster moving if not airborne but he (William Fichtner) is not merely terrified of what might happen to the boys or his biplane but as a World War I vet regards their fantasies of war with horror.But as young men Danny and Rafe remain consumed with flying and volunteer for the U.S. Army Air Force well before Pearl Harbor. In early 1941 in New York City the brash Rafe volunteers to fly in the Eagle Squadron during the Battle of Britain. Evelyn and Danny are sent to Honolulu with Rafe arriving there much to their surprise on Dec. 5.Colm Feores Adm. Kimmel and others in command at Pearl Harbor are alarmed at the apparent disappearance of the Japanese fleet and Kimmels cryptologist (Dan Aykroyd) feels certain that the Japanese are heading for Pearl Harbor instead of the Philippines or the South Seas but he hasnt quite cracked the Japanese code.The Americans have cut off Japans oil supplies and Adm. Yamamoto (Mako) a famously reluctant but brilliant Harvard-educated warrior sees no course but to launch a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor where more than 100 ships about half the entire U.S. Pacific Fleet were anchored. At 755 on a Sunday morning the Japanese unleashed 183 planes aimed not only at the ships in Pearl Harbor but at all military installations on Oahu.Bay cinematographer John Schwartzman and their crew convey the swiftness and the vast scope of the attack; they give us the tremendous scale of the bombing of Pearl Harbor with special focus on the fate of the USS Arizona which exploded and quickly sank. Of the 1514 men aboard 1177 lost their lives 900 trapped in the vessel never to be recovered.At the time of the attack sequence we have already met Cuba Gooding Jr.s real-life Dorie Miller who as a black man in the segregated U.S. armed services of the time was confined to cooking in the USS Arizonas galley--but who gets his chance to be a gunner more swiftly than he could have ever imagined. Bay suggests the magnitude and horror of the attack without lingering on images of hideous suffering to the point of morbidity.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/2001/may/25/entertainment/ca-2181,200,pearlharbor26,pearlharbor,latimes

To see her 1934 documentary Triumph of the Will today is to marvel at her mastery of cinema as a propaganda tool. It may be heretical to say so but Michael Bay the director of Pearl Harbor and other equally bombastic and manipulative action movies may be Riefenstahls equal in his ability to marshal resources for the advancement of unworthy causes. In his case he isnt selling anything as monstrous as Nazism. But appearances aside he isnt selling anything noble either. With a 140 million budget and a cast of thousands -- and a background in making commercials naturally -- he is pushing nothing more or less than a vision of America comprising equal parts of Norman Rockwell romance novels patriotic old war movies and MTV. Its no place Id want to live -- this three-hour visit was too long for me -- yet I cant deny that I left the theater walking tall proud to live in a land where men are men and women look like Kate Beckinsale. The movie stirred me shook me and brought a tear to my eye but mostly it left me bored very bored and annoyed that such a mindless contrivance will command the nations attention this Memorial Day. There are people out there who will really believe Pearl Harbor is about something other than getting people into theaters cynically punching their buttons to create a series of sensations and then sending them home with nice thoughts. Bay and producer Jerry Bruckheimer want you to feel good about the selfless great-looking characters and the good ol U.S.A. but mostly they want you to feel good about the movie good enough to tell friends to see it. To get the maximum number of backsides into seats the filmmakers have avoided harsh language and gore -- its strange to see bodies struck by bullets while submerged in water yet see no billows of blood -- and they also have made sure that members of every possible demographic group will have reason to feel good about themselves. Women blacks the physically disabled and the Japanese all get a moment to be heroic or at least wise. Because America distrusted everyone of Japanese descent and herded them into internment camps during the war some Japanese-Americans worry the movie will revive feelings of ill will. The filmmakers try to be careful however to present the Japanese rationale for the bombing and not reduce them to faceless automatons or caricatures. At one point a Japanese general even turns to the camera and intones sagely ""I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant."" Cuba Gooding Jr. in a minuscule role plays a cook on a ship that is destroyed. Based on a Texas man who really lived hes meant to represent the frustrated African-Americans who were relegated to menial positions. During the attack however he gets to man an anti-aircraft gun and fight like a man. You know the movie is trying too hard though when a barely recognizable Jon Voight as President Franklin Delano Roosevelt struggles out of his wheelchair and stands in order to make a point to his staff. He knows hardship his actions say. He knows discouragement. But the time has come for America to stand tall and he is proof it can be done. Further evidence the film was shaped by focus groups and marketing concerns is the filmmakers reported decision to remove a brief patriotic voiceover from versions of the film that play overseas. The voiceover is distracting and out of place -- it never should have been included in the first place -- but to remove it to avoid challenging national viewpoints other than our own is craven. The main focus of the story is the relationship between three people -- the dyslexic fighter pilot Rafe (Ben Affleck) his best pal and fellow pilot Danny (Josh Hartnett) and Evelyn (Beckinsale) the nurse they both love. We first see the men as boys playing fighter pilot in a makeshift plane on a Tennessee farm. This brief prologue besides establishing the boys bond and personalities introduces us both to the films narrative strategy and its ham-handedness. Were presented initially with an iconic image of a family farm a crop-dusting plane circling overhead presenting as pure and idealized a vision of America as youll ever see. Rafes father is the crop duster. He drives off after landing his plane and the boys scamper into the cockpit to play. Theyre scared out of their wits when they hit a switch that makes the plane lurch taxi and briefly take off. Dannys dad viciously beats the tar out of Danny but when Rafe knocks the brute down his rage vanishes. Something Rafe says has brought back memories of his war experiences. When he trudges off in silence Danny tells Rafe ""Youre my best friend"" then runs lovingly off after his dad. Nobody here talks or behaves like anyone you know. Realism is not the goal. Concision and force are what matter -- every image and utterance counts. Poetry works like this but so do greeting cards and television commercials. And so do all of Bays films which include Armageddon The Rock and Bad Boys. The other thing one notices about this scene is the sudden changes in tone and the predictable occurances (their getting caught for instance) that come with unexpected twists (the sudden pensiveness of Dannys father). All of this -- the loaded images triteness tone changes and the little trists -- continue throughout the movie. Its what keeps the audience hooked during the long wait for the boom-boom parts. (The raid which will remind viewers of Titanic Star Wars and even Saving Private Ryan -- as if portions of all three films and others were thrown into a blender -- lasts 40 minutes.) During all the fighting the filmmakers devote generous screen time to the nurses. This is rare for a war movie and commendable but it still feels like someone was on the set with a list checking off demographic groups as they each got their moment to shine. As a filmmaker Bay specializes in a sort of shorthand that I would call postmodern if only that term didnt suggest a level of thoughtfulness and integrity to which he doesnt seem to aspire. He uses iconic images as powerful as anything out of Sergei Eisensteins ouvre. But to see Bay at work is to be reminded how thoroughly the pragmatic world of advertising from which he rose has ransacked the history of cinema to enrich its bag of tricks. A young mother walking to church with her young daughter in their Sunday best suggests a world and a set of values even though we see it for only a second. Bay presents us with a succession of such images as the Japanese commence their surprise attack. He does this sort of thing time and again -- the movie is 183 minutes of carefully composed expertly filmed and edited images that telegraph meaning regardless of whether theyre accompanied by words. Even when he cuts away in a fraction of a second the images work on an almost subliminal level. If its been committed to celluloid Bay feels hes free to use it for his purposes. As a result Pearl Harbor constantly reminds you of other better movies (yes even From Here to Eternity) -- but only for a second because then hes off to something else. The mixing of strategies wouldnt work in a real movie but in a Bay-Bruckheimer concoction cohesion and consistency dont matter. All that matters is the Effect. So in a movie that is all about America -- our innocence before the bombing and our tragic resolve afterward -- the movie keeps cutting away to show the enemy and we hear a Japanese soldiers letter home in voiceover. Near the end we hear Beckinsales character again in voiceover deliver a short speech in which she foretells a bit of the future of one of the characters and sums up the meaning of the war for America. All of this along with all the brief supporting appearances by well-known actors calls to mind Terrence Malicks The Thin Red Line in which internal monologue and stream-of-consciousness musings were an integral part of the aesthetic strategy. Here its just a shortcut a way to tell the audience how to feel and its done with the filmmakers scornful conviction that no one will mind. Strangely though after all of the movies manipulations and the big events we dont get a sense at the end that weve accompanied the characters through a journey. Theyre supposed to have changed profoundly just as the nation did but we dont feel it. It just feels like theyve been through one heck of a roller-coaster ride. And the tragedy of Pearl Harbor deserves more than that.

Now 60 years later Disney Studios is hoping that May 25 -- the opening day of the new film ""Pearl Harbor"" -- will be a day that lives in box office legend. But despite all the advance press and the lavish premiere held in Hawaii this movie will not alter the course of world history. That isnt because director Michael Bay and producer Jerry Bruckheimer didnt try to make this flick into a massive historical epic by injecting it with enough testosterone to float a battleship -- or two.

Director Michael Bay and producer Jerry Bruckheimer obviously sat through several hundred viewings of ""Titanic"" in preparation for this epic stab at gainful patriotism. All the elements of that movie are on display and then some ... and then some more and then some more again. Forget the concession stand. They should set up a mess tent at back of the theater and feed the audience in shifts. First its a buddy picture. Then it becomes a love story. Then its an effects-heavy action movie. Then its a love story again. Then its a different action movie. Then it gets back to being a love story. These arent just quick sequences mind you.

On the intervening day Dec. 7 1941 a stealth air and naval attack on Hawaiis Pearl Harbor by the Japanese resulted in the loss of lives and American innocence.As realized by Bay loved and loathed for earsplitting action flicks such as The Rock and Armageddon Pearl Harbor is a comparatively modulated well-wrought and frequently overwrought showdown between the Land of the Setting Sun and The Land of the Rising Sun. Jingoistic? Not exactly but close. Uncomfortably so.On the heels of one of the most divisive elections in U.S. history Wallace and Bay deserve some kind of credit for a movie that exalts American unity of purpose.But they deny their characters (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett as Army Air Corps fighter pilots Kate Beckinsale as the military nurse beloved by both) an ideal to fight for. They even deny them characters. Instead this soap opera offers an enemy to unite against those inscrutable Japanese.The impassive aphorism-spouting Japanese commanders here recall the Charlie Chan character purveyed by 40s Hollywood the difference being that they are played by Asians instead of Caucasians in yellowface. (Yes there are other Asians in the film A Japanese American dentist who passes intelligence to Adm. Yamamoto and the Hawaiian bouncer of a bar euphoniously named the Hula-La.)Patched onto this tapestry of American bravery and martyrdom in the face of Japanese attack is the story of the real-life Dorie Miller (Cuba Gooding Jr.) the black sailor assigned to the mess who emerges as a hero when he grabs Browning anti-aircraft machine guns and shoots down two Japanese planes.Unlike the explicit scenes of carnage in the R-rated Saving Private Ryan the PG-13 war sequences here are implicit to the point of gung-ho glamour. It might be unfair to contrast the gut-spilling urgency of a film about the infantry with one about pilot heroes swooping over their faceless adversaries but it is fair to say that the films strive for very different effects.Private Ryan communicated deep ambivalence about war and a deeper mistrust of heroism. In Steven Spielbergs movie there were casualties and survivors and the realization that medals often went to those possessing the dumb luck to survive.By contrast the unwavering flag-waving Pearl Harbor suggests that heroism is a game more of skill than of chance. Surprisingly there is no scene showing the difference between two Tennessee boys playing war in 1923 and making war in 1942. For the purposes of this movie a joystick is a joystick. Blame this on a script with the most underdeveloped characters and spectacularly realized visuals since Titanic.Bay masters many other lessons from that blockbuster. Among them is his hold on its operatic sweep and his understanding that he can maximize his audience by interweaving romantic with action sequences and that plot twists arent cliches if the audience hasnt seen them before.He clearly likes shooting at sunset that magic time when factories glow like palaces and ordinary folk like kings. But there is so much glow emanating off Affleck Hartnett Beckinsale and Gooding that you might mistake them for figures in a Maxfield Parrish dreamscape or a religious chromo. (The death of one character is literally a crucifixion.) This quartet of fine performers doesnt so much act here as strike heroic photogenic poses.And boy does Bay ever lack an ear. What we now call World War I was known in 1941 as The Great War so I doubt that anyone said as one character does here as bombing begins ""I think World War II has started.""But Bay does have an eye When the Japanese planes swarm over Hawaii its some shot - like killer bees strafing cotton-candy clouds over Eden. Because the Americans are so resourceful in fighting the sneak attack (I especially liked Beckinsales use of her stocking as a tourniquet) Bay effectively turns one of the great national defeats into a victory one that leads to the 1942 U.S. bombing of Tokyo.What Bay has done is made agitprop exhorting Americans to believe in a cause larger than themselves. Too bad that the cause is an eye for an eye.Carrie Rickeys e-mail address is crickeyphillynews.com.Pearl Harbor Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay directed by Bay written by Randall Wallace photography by John Schwartzman music by Hans Zimmer distributed by Touchstone Pictures.Running time 3 hours 3 mins.Rafe McCawley. . .

"`Pearl Harbor Bombs Out - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Saving Private Ryan `Pearl Harbor Bombs OutMoviesA Bland Love Story A Lack Of Conflict And A Well-known Outcome Destroy The Movie.May 25 2001|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticMay 25 2001 is a day that will live in well not infamy exactly but certainly not glory either.Today is pretty much ruined because its the opening day of Pearl Harbor.If Japans bombing of the real Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7 1941 came as a surprise to the people of the United States the release of this dreary juggernaut about that raid is anything but. Disneys famously powerful publicity machine has been working full tilt for months on this lame extravaganza which is reported to have cost upward of 140 million to produce and market.But the best-kept secret of the advertising campaign is that the new film is a dud.In terms of quality this Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay production is a lot like every overblown TV miniseries that youve ever turned off after 15 minutes and then hated yourself for having been suckered into. The best thing to be said for Pearl Harbor in fact is that it gives you a new appreciation for what Steven Spielberg accomplished in Saving Private Ryan.After a brief prologue the story begins in early 1941 just months before America entered World War II.Our heroes are Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) boyhood buddies from Tennessee who are training to be pilots on New Yorks Long Island. While taking a military physical Rafe meets and falls for Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) the plucky Navy nurse who jabs his cute bum with a hypodermic needle.Its love at first strike for her too. But complications arise when Rafe heads off to war early by joining a special British flying squadron for Americans.If youve seen such films by producer Bruckheimer and director Bay as Armageddon and The Rock you would naturally expect Pearl Harbor to be loud violent and exploitative. But actually the new movie which was written by Randall Wallace (Braveheart) is disastrous in an entirely different way.Oh sure there are violent passages including a long one that shows the bombing of the U.S. base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. (The attack boys and girls triggered our countrys entry into the war.) But these scenes of combat turn out to be the best parts of the movie.No they dont bring you right into the horror of the action as the opening battle of Saving Private Ryan did. But in their own neo-Top Gun way theyre impressiveSpecial effects now allow us to follow every inch of a bombs descent from the plane that carries it to the target it destroys.The real problem with the approximately three-hour Pearl Harbor is that when no ones fighting its mostly a blindingly tedious soap opera complete with an unexciting love triangle a pushy musical score a miraculous feat by a disabled character and an equally miraculous revival of one of the heroes. Then there is the dialogueEvelyn Whats going to become of us all Rafe?Rafe The futures not exactly in our hands is it?Sheesh Throw in an evil twin or two and youd have the whole ludicrous package.In this sort of movie characters dont so much develop as keep restating their personality traits. And in fact there are fewer of those than you might expect.Evelyn for example is about as generic a Navy nurse as you can imagine. And the only real difference between Rafe and Danny is that the latter is a bit shy.Forgive the pun but most of the actors seem to be on automatic pilot.To give one of Rafe and Dannys flyboy buddies a memorable personality the filmmakers actually resort to making him both a redhead (named Red) and a stutterer. Another guy likes to surf. You get the idea.Although the spirit of the production is 40s-retro there are a few nods to modern sensibilities.There isnt much smoking among the servicemen in this film notwithstanding one token scene in which ""victory cigars"" are distributed. And the females seem somewhat more liberated than women of the period might actually have been.As for the Japanese attackers they are not portrayed as subhuman as they typically were in wartime American movies. As a sour-faced enemy admiral Mako doesnt wear the old ""sneaky"" glasses or bark at his subordinates. And instead of the old gong sound or that old wacky-sinister Asian-style music dignified war drums are sounded when he appears on the screen.For the sake of diversity or a marketing opportunity (the two things being essentially identical in todays cynical Hollywood) a subplot about a heroic black Navy cook Doris ""Dorie"" Miller (Cuba Gooding Jr.) has been awkwardly shoehorned into the narrative.Miller incidentally is one of the few characters in Pearl Harbor who is based on a real person. Another is James H. Doolittle a flying ace and pilot trainer played by Alec Baldwin who often seems on the verge of laughing at the entire production.""Victory belongs to those who believe in it the most believe in it the longest"" he exclaims somehow managing not to break up.From time to time we also see President Roosevelt played behind heavy makeup by Jon Voight. In what is destined to become a camp-classic scene the president inspires his advisers to do the impossible by rising unaided from his wheelchair.""Do not tell me `It cant be done "" thunders the mighty FDR. But what cant be done anymore are preposterous scenes such as that one.It goes without saying that the brave Americans who fought in World War II deserve a much better movie than this. And so for that matter do the rest of us.War of course is hell. But war movies dont have to be.

"Pearl Harbor | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; pearl-harbor ) Pearl Harbor (United States 2001) A movie review by James Berardinelli To think of uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer and action director Michael Bay is to be reminded of popcorn-and-eye candy trifles like The Rock and Armageddon - movies where flashy special effects and lobotomized scripts are arguably assets. The pairing of Bruckheimer and Bay does not provoke thoughts of a serious epic set against a grand historical backdrop - and Pearl Harbor illustrates why this is the case. Its a mystery why with 135 million being spent on this motion picture a few dollars couldnt have been lavished on the screenplay. The writing (credited to Braveheart scribe Randall Wallace) isnt just mediocre - its embarrassingly bad. This movie has more howlers than the average comedy - and all of those lines are of course unintentionally funny. Perhaps one of the reasons I experienced such an unexpectedly negative reaction while watching Pearl Harbor is that the movie had the potential to be so much better. The cast is solid the special effects are first-rate and the subject is inherently compelling. The events which shattered the stillness of the morning of December 7 1941 obsess history buffs to this day. Aside from 1970s Tora Tora Tora no feature film has effectively captured the scope of the Japanese offensive of that day. Sadly while Pearl Harbor presents a credible digitally-enhanced re-creation of the attack thats one of the few things the movie accomplishes. From start to finish the centerpiece action takes only 35 minutes - or about 20% of the overall running time. Pearl Harbor is a Titanic wannabe that falls far short of the mark. Even those who dont appreciate Titanic are likely to acknowledge how much better it is than Pearl Harbor on nearly every level. Both films suffer from areas of historical error but while Titanic manages to overcome its factual discrepancies by presenting an absorbing spectacle Pearl Harbor sinks beneath the weight of its own split personality ponderous and self-important on one hand pandering to an uneducated audience on the other. Plus while Titanic earns its three-plus hour running length Pearl Harbor doesnt. It has to incorporate a lame prologue and out-of-place third act in order to pad things out to a final screen time of 183 minutes. Historically the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor represented one of the key actions of World War II because it sucked the United States into the war. The attack devised by Admiral Yamamoto commander of the Japanese fleet brought the brunt of the Japanese military power to bear on Hawaii. In a two-hour period 18 ships were sunk or badly damaged (including the Arizona which split in two then went under; the West Virginia; and the Oklahoma which rolled over) 188 planes were destroyed (with an additional 159 damaged) and more than 3500 Americans were killed or wounded. Fortunately for the American Pacific fleet the three aircraft carriers based at Pearl Harbor were out to sea at the time of the attack. On the day after President Roosevelt stood before Congress and after declaring December 7 1941 to be a ""date that will live in infamy"" he urged that a declaration of war be issued. Meanwhile half a world away the Japanese celebrated their victory but Yamamoto wondered out loud whether the attack had been the best thing saying ""I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve."" Indeed the Pearl Harbor air raid united the American people in a way that no other event in the 20th century did. Pearl Harbor depicts all of this (and more - the third act is an account of Dolittles April 1942 bombing raid on Tokyo launched from the Hornet) but does so in a slapdash fashion. It is possible to argue that Pearl Harbors agenda is too ambitious for a single motion picture tell a love story represent the historical situation and offer a concluding catharsis that does not come naturally to the tale of what transpired at Pearl Harbor. The movie does many things but only succeeds in doing a few of them well. As a history lesson Pearl Harbor can best be described as incomplete and perfunctory. This would easily be forgivable if the picture had more to offer in other areas; unfortunately it doesnt. So the films flawed historical context becomes its key selling point. The story is presented from the point-of-view of three central characters bomber pilots Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) and nurse Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale) the woman who loves and is loved by these two best friends. Rafe and Danny are closer than brothers until Evelyn comes between them. But before the romantic triangle can be sorted out Pearl Harbor is attacked and all three are called to perform acts of outrageous heroism (much as one would expect from men and women populating any Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay film). The central problem with the film is not the reliance upon special effects or the overlong running time - its the lack of dramatic tension and empathy for the protagonists. Largely because it employs clichA(c)s and contrivances to push the narrative forward the screenplay never draws us into the characters world nor does it involve us in their romance (certainly not the way Titanic does). Shortcuts like montages and flashbacks are used depict the depth of the characters feelings for one another. From the beginning we are subjected to a series of badly conceived and executed scenes such as one in which two kids accidentally head down a runway in a crop-dusting plane (shades of Anakins experience in The Phantom Menace) or another in which an eight-year old hits an adult with a 4x4. The dialogue is equally atrocious. People say things like ""Im not anxious to die just anxious to matter"" and ""Theres nothing stronger than the heart of a volunteer."" And were stuck with a soap opera-style storyline that features brawling as a form of male bonding people returning from the dead unexpected pregnancies and a woman torn between two lovers. Through it all we are strangely detached from the situation; until the attack comes Pearl Harbor is not an involving experience. For about 35 minutes as the bombs are falling and things are blowing up Pearl Harbor takes off. Suddenly were no longer stuck with dumb character interaction and painful dialogue. Instead we can sit back and watch the devastation unfold. Its impressive especially when the Arizona goes down. But when it comes to an end and the last torpedo has been launched the movie still has nearly an hour to go. That isnt a good thing because then the characters start surfacing again and theyre not as interesting as a sinking ship or an exploding plane. I fault the script and the director (who uses frequent cuts lots of slow motion shots and even smears vasoline on the lens for certain scenes) not the actors. Kate Beckinsale and Alec Baldwin (playing General Dolittle) give especially strong performances. Its worth noting that Beckinsale is dressed and shot (using backlighting and soft focus) in a way that makes her look like a female screen icon of the 40s. Affleck and Hartnet are fine although Affleck comes across as a little too cocky to be truly likable. Cuba Gooding Jr. has a supporting role as a cook who gets involved in the action (the character has no back story - I guess were supposed to assume its similar to that of the hero Gooding portrayed in Men of Honor). And Jon Voight offers a credible Franklin Roosevelt. While Pearl Harbor doesnt have any big-name A-list stars (the budget couldnt support them) there are a lot of familiar faces including those of Colm Feore (as Admiral Kimmel) Tom Sizemore (as the mechanic Earl) Mako (Admiral Yamamoto) and Dan Aykroyd (Captain Thurman the tactical expert). You know a movie is being ineffective when youre thinking about all the things its doing wrong before five minutes have elapsed. Pearl Harbor is designed as a crowd-pleaser and as is too often the case with that sort of a motion picture it values good looking sets attractive performers and flashy special effects over an intelligent screenplay. And despite trying Pearl Harbor cant even follow the Titanic formula properly. This movie is not completely without value but theres a lot of sub-par dross to be sifted through to get to the worthwhile material. If youre really interested in what happened at Pearl Harbor rent Tora Tora Tora or one of many detailed documentaries. If you crave a tragic romance Titanic is one of many choices. Pearl Harbor only shines when the special effects eclipse the ""human element"" - better to wait until its available on video and you have the option of using a fast-forward button.

Ninety minutes into this massive movie the attack commences and the spectacular images come hurtling like fireballs. This islets be honest what were here for and what most Jerry Bruckheimer-produced movies serve up best the poetry of destruction. Fighter planes swoop between buildings like something out of ""Star Wars."" A battleship flips sideways in the Hawaiian harbor the crew clutching to the edge like something out of ""Titanic."" Drowning soldiers are shot underwater enemy bullets strafing the ocean like something out of ""Saving Private Ryan.""Violent and thrilling these images go directly to your central nervous system. But Bay isnt making a movie about wars horror. Its more like a roller-coaster ride. Nor is it really a movie about history if you want to know the step-by-step events that led up to Dec. 7 1941 rent the turgid impersonal ""Tora Tora Tora.""""Pearl Harbor"" which sets the Japanese attack in the heart of a two-guys-and-a-gal love story is above all a movie about its own movieness. From its prologue in Tennessee in 1923 where our two flyboy heroes (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) are introduced as airplane-obsessed kids to its climax after the James Doolittle-led bombing of Tokyo in 1942 everything is larger louder more picture-perfect than life. Hollywood movies dont get more Hollywood than ""Pearl Harbor."" Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week There is a price to be paid for so much cinematic self-consciousness. An air of unreality hangs over most every scene. Bay approaches the romance between fighter pilot Rafe (Affleck) and volunteer nurse Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) with the same pow-kabang cartoon energy he brought to ""Armageddon."" Our lovers meet cute at a New York induction center where cocky Affleck drops his pants and no-nonsense Beckinsale gives him a punishing hypodermic thrust in the rump. It must be love. Next thing you know theyre enjoying an idyllic interlude on a boat then bidding goodbye through a hotels revolving door as Rafe volunteers for duty in England.Its all told in shorthand as if the filmmakers assumed we were so hip to the conventions of movie romance that they neednt bother laying the relationships emotional foundation. Without the familiar prop of action to fall back on Bay seems worried that we might get bored. He doesnt let his scenes breathe and they come off feeling both fussy and truncated. The first hour of ""Pearl Harbor"" looks like a highlight reel--a trailer for itself.The three leads are all appealing and theyre lit for maximum glamour. But as written by Randall Wallace Rafe Danny (Hartnett) and Evelyn are just templates waiting to be filled by a movie star. Who is this pretty brave nurse whom both men fall in love with? What did she do before the war? Almost every line of dialogue sounds like it came from an old movie.In England Rafes plane is shot down. Back in Hawaii Danny brings the bad news to Evelyn. You can guess what happens next. After mourning briefly Danny and Evelyn make love in the airfield hangar their perfect bodies artfully draped in designer parachutes. Surely Im not spoiling any surprises by revealing that Rafe is not in fact dead. Astonishingly Bay bungles Rafes dramatic reappearance rushing through it so hastily it has no emotional impact.The bombing comes not a moment too soon and for 40 minutes the movie dazzles us with fireworks. Once America enters the war the tone shifts to flag-waving. FDR cleverly impersonated by Jon Voight is treated so reverently you almost expect a halo to crown his head.""Titanic"" showed how hungry the world was for old-fashioned epic love stories and the grandiloquently kitschy ""Pearl Harbor"" is strenuously aimed at the same audience. But will Bays postmodern artifice tug the heartstrings as James Camerons sturdily classical movie did? Only once did I get a lump in my throat. But what we critics say may not matter. Superbly marketed ""Pearl Harbor"" is the very model of a modern blockbuster. Will it matter that almost nothing about its human drama rings true?Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?
