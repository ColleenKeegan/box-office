Entertainment The Future Of ""Tomorrowland"" Is Optimistic But Not Exactly Welcoming Brad Birds new movie offers jetpacks and gee-whiz and also a lecture. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Britt Robertson in Tomorrowland. Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures ID 5745185 We take our futures dark these days. If were not reveling in stories of approaching or full-on apocalypse -- The Walking Dead Mad Max Fury Road Terminator Genisys -- then were delving into the functioning but grim dystopias offered by The Maze Divergent Games. The doom and gloom is evidence of our continuing infatuation with the end of the world.Tomorrowland would like to change that. Not just by presenting a throwback rockets-and-rayguns vision of the future rising on the horizon above amber waves of grain in a blaze of chrome and glass but by arguing that its actually better for humanity to look at the future through rose-colored lenses -- necessary even. Its teenage heroine Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) is special not just because of her interest in technology and faith in its promise but because shes an optimist. She believes that things can change for the better when apparently everyone else has given up. At school faced with a montage of dark messages about the environment and global politics and George Orwell she persistently raises her hand to ask what we can do to fix things while teachers gape at her in befuddlement.Though its not director Brad Birds first retro-futuristic rodeo Tomorrowland is his most stridently sermonizing. His animated The Iron Giant and The Incredibles were flavored with the future by way of the 50s and 60s combining Cold War paranoia with the arrival of an alien robot and showcasing prime space-age design and gadgetry in a suburban superhero setting. But Tomorrowland is live action and the CGI metropolis of its title is a whirring splendidly realized place of flying monorails and space shuttles to the moon. In the movie its both an idea and a physical location tucked away in its own universe. Thomas Robinson and Raffey Cassidy in Tomorrowland Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures Tomorrowland Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures ID 5797562 In the real world its part of a theme park though Bird and screenwriter Damon Lindelof (whose last film was the -- ahem -- zombie apocalyptic World War Z) bypass the Magic Kingdom in favor of taking the Disney-influenced 1964 New York Worlds Fair as its major touchstone. Its the Worlds Fair where young Frank Walker (Thomas Robinson) brings his not-quite-working jetpack and meets the preternaturally composed Athena (scene-stealer Raffey Cassidy) who shows him the way to Tomorrowland where the best and brightest work on creating a better world.And somewhere after that things went wrong though Frank made the excellent choice of growing up to be George Clooney even if hes also become a grumpy hermit living in high-tech seclusion until Athena and Casey enlist him to save the world. But theres a reason the movie takes so much time getting back to Tomorrowland through a series of episodes that are often cleverly staged (Birds deft with action) but start to feel like running in place especially during a pretty but unnecessary visit to Paris.Its because despite the explanatory monologue the movies villain unleashes about dark visions of the future just encouraging people to give up utopias are boring. Tomorrowland is boring. The only interesting thing to be done with Tomorrowland is to save it. When its up and running its a frictionless locale where idealism is everything where concerns like money and cultural conflict have apparently been eliminated by technology. Its a nice place to visit but you wouldnt set an actual movie there.Theres an earnest conviction to the message that Bird and Lindelof present in Tomorrowland which urges its audience to be active to seek solutions and to consider the awesomeness of STEM fields. But it delivers this message by pitting utopia against dystopia in a way thats not just jarring but ultimately unfair a dismissal of the issues we use dystopian fiction to explore and illuminate. 1984 isnt a classic because we like to wallow in bleakness. George Clooney in Tomorrowland Walt Disney Motion Picture Studios Britt Robertson in Tomorrowland Walt Disney Motion Picture Studios ID 5797613 The movie ends with a vaguely techno-libertarian directive to stop complaining and start doing which is more achievable when you have a magical realm of seemingly infinite resources at your disposal. Or as Casey puts it ""Its hard to have ideas and easy to give up"" -- a grating thing to hear from a perky suburban teenager whose repeated sabotaging of a NASA demolition site is treated as spunkiness.Theres a nostalgized sense of wonder that infuses the movies opening scenes back in 1964 -- but Tomorrowland struggles to update that 60s-style future for our present in part because it doesnt reflect the world we live in now. Hell it doesnt even reflect the entirety of the decade from which it was plucked a decade that erupted in counterculture and protest. There was a fundamental conservative escapism to that shiny vision of the future so concerned with flying cars and so oblivious to the internet -- its an amped-up version of an idealized All-American city in the same way The Jetsons just gave a space-age version to a regular old family sitcom.The cyberpunk Los Angeles of Blade Runner may have been a fucked-up place full of megacorporations and killer replicants but it was also globalized a city where a giant Japanese ad played on the side of a building where people spoke multinational pidgin. Its hero didnt get a hamburger from some cutting-edge automat he rubbed chopsticks together before digging into a bowl at a sidewalk noodle bar. Class and poverty were visible everywhere not erased from sight.If Tomorrowlands futurescape is aspirational its still one in which the smartest people in the world band together to come up with something that is coincidentally right out of Walt Disneys 1960s dreams with a few more people of color scattered through the background. Its celebration of dreamers may be optimistic but its also exclusionary one in which the gifted elite who are going to save everyone are also the ones who got everyone into trouble in the first place. And anyway utopia is always going to be better in theory than in practice especially when it comes to the tricky issue of finding someone to foot the bill -- after all Disneylands first version of Tomorrowland was sponsored by among others Monsanto.

Comments (3) click to enlarge Tomorrowland Video Rated PG  130 minutes  2015 Banking on the success of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise Disney poaches another of its theme park attractions for this sci-fi adventure. A plucky teenager (Britt Robertson) discovers an interdimensional utopia while helping a cranky scientist (George Clooney) and robot child (Raffey Cassidy) prevent Earths self-imposed apocalypse. Director Brad Bird brings his vivid widescreen compositions and kitschy retro-futurism to a screenplay he co-wrote with Damon Lindleof but his storytelling a strong point in The Iron Giant (1999) and The Incredibles (2004) is harsh and inelegant. An aggressively optimistic script admonishes the lazy and irresolute and urges humanity to end war and save the environment; the proselytizing burdens an already onerous plot. With Hugh Laurie.

From the moment you first see that 1960s atomic-energy symbol as the middle ""O"" in the opening title credit for Brad Birds massive Disney summer adventure ""Tomorrowland"" you know its bad news. I mean right? Once upon a time that stylized little graphic of particles looping around a nucleus stood for a future of unlimited clean power; now it stands for Fukushima and Three Mile Island and concrete-reinforced subterranean pits that will still be full of radioactive waste long after the human race has perished from the planet. But the wonder of ""Tomorrowland"" - and with all its flaws and its hidebound Disney formula it really is wonderful - is that Birds tale of nostalgia for the lost future manages to recapture some of that original optimistic meaning without losing sight of the newer and darker one.Bird built his reputation as a director of ambitious family-oriented animated films making ""The Iron Giant"" ""The Incredibles"" and ""Ratatouille"" before moving into live action with the triumphant 2011 action spectacle ""Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol."" If that movie achieved two unlikely goals resuscitating a seemingly defunct franchise and reviving the flagging star career of Tom Cruise Birds ambitions in ""Tomorrowland"" are higher still. If youre old enough to remember the original significance of that atomic-power symbol - and to understand the iconic importance of the 1964 Worlds Fair in New Yorks Flushing Meadows a central touchstone of ""Tomorrowland"" - then you also remember the live-action Disney films that dominated Saturday-morning moviegoing in the 60s and 70s. Its a much-derided tradition that included a good deal of insipid and forgettable junk (Dick Van Dyke as ""Lt. Robin Crusoe U.S.N."") but at its best - ""Mary Poppins"" and ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" sure but also ""That Darn Cat"" and ""The Love Bug"" - produced a number of blissfully enjoyable family experiences large doses of innocence flavored with just a smidgen of adult experience.What Bird and co-writer Damon Lindelof seek to do in ""Tomorrowland"" is to recapture the energy and enthusiasm of those classic Disney offerings while also repackaging and reframing it for a much different and far more guarded era. I can understand why some viewers feel let down by the conventional story theyre telling here which is a familiar fable about a plucky teen who might just be able to counteract grown-up cynicism and save Fairyland from self-destruction. But for my money they come doggone close to succeeding The visual thrills and unjaded inventiveness of ""Tomorrowland"" are off the charts as it careens back and forth between our world plagued by climate change environmental degradation and political crisis and an alternate dimension where all the futuristic dreams of the Jet Age imagined so lovingly at that 1964 Worlds Fair seem to have come true.Even the preachy and sentimental final montage of ""Tomorrowland"" which strains to fend off all possible political and cultural criticism brought me to the edge of tears. I watched this movie from a particular perspective as the father of a geeky and technology-obsessed 11-year-old who is only now coming to grips with the fact that he was born into a world that seems to have lost its yearning for adventure and its zest for the future. He is likely to love this movie more than words can express and to discern deep meaning and purpose in it. With its ardent promise that hope is not lost ""Tomorrowland"" could serve as a formative inspiration for my son and many other kids like him and for that alone I am profoundly grateful.I am often dismissive of spoiler concerns (as some of you are eager to remind me) but in this case I really want to be cautious about not revealing too much. I think we can say that George Clooney in his best crotchety loner mode plays a reclusive inventor named Frank Walker who long ago - at that legendary and heartbreakingly realized Flushing Worlds Fair in fact - had a childhood encounter with a strange little girl named Athena (Raffey Cassidy) that changed his life. Back in the 21st century Athena reappears (looking no older than she did 50 years ago) and settles on a new target a plucky tomboy genius named Casey (irresistible newcomer Britt Robertson) whose task is to drag Frank out of his half-century funk. Oh yeah - she also has to outwit hordes of killer cyborgs who seem a little too obviously imported from ""The Matrix"" and then she has to save the planet from imminent destruction. But thats it. You Might Also Like There are any number of spectacular special-effects scenes in ""Tomorrowland"" and if they ultimately get repetitious all are delivered with the combination of good humor and unquenchable brio that feels like Birds trademark. It turns out that interdimensional travel leaves you super dehydrated for example - and creates a seamless opportunity for Coca-Cola product placement (In some weird way I didnt mind. Finding that they had Coke in another dimension would be oddly reassuring.) It also turns out that Gustave Eiffels well-known construction in Paris has a secret purpose we never suspected and that Nikola Tesla Thomas Edison and Jules Verne were all in on it. (I promise Im stopping there) Hugh Laurie gets a slightly undercooked role as the semi-villainous scientist-prince of Athenas decaying utopia and Kathryn Hahn and Keegan-Michael Key make amusing cameos as a pair of sci-fi collector geeks up to no good.But I think the real appeal of ""Tomorrowland"" does not lie in the splashy CGI creations or the giant-robot fight scenes (because we really have seen enough of those) but in a secret ingredient thats harder to define. For one thing Bird never seems bored or exhausted by the story hes telling and his central characters are clear and appealing. Of course we know that Clooneys Frank will turn out to be decent after all and since hes George Clooney we know he wont behave creepily toward the cute teenager camped out on his front porch. Franks relationship with Athena is the secret engine of his personality which wont seem much like a secret to adult viewers and this role demands a kind of purity from Clooney that makes it one of his best film performances.Some people will find ""Tomorrowland"" total cornball but I didnt. At a philosophical level its subject is deeply intertwined with its form and its message We have lost faith with the future and the effects are poisonous. We have gotten addicted to gloom and paralyzed by it Bird argues; we have all seen the writing on the planetary wall shrugged and gone back to our cubicles and our iPads. Our civilizations death wish and self-hatred have grown so strong that they threaten to become self-fulfilling prophecies devouring both will and courage. I certainly dont think our problem is quite that simple and ""Tomorrowland"" comes dangerously close to announcing that the next generation inspired by the not-quite-dead spirit of 64 will save us after all. But I find considerable simplicity and truth in the basic premise that our fixation with dystopia is not helpful. I wont be the first person to observe that ""Tomorrowland"" is strikingly similar in terms of theme and narrative structure and other elements to Christopher Nolans ""Interstellar."" Both films wonder ruefully what became of the glorious technological optimism of the Space Age ask whether hope can be rescued from the ruins and imagine human redemption through love. You could almost say that the magical realm that Athena offers to Casey and Frank in ""Tomorrowland"" is the same constrained extraplanetary paradise where Matthew McConaughey winds up near the end of ""Interstellar.""For all its technical magnificence the Nolan film is a maudlin and despairing slog through a ruined future and the only version of hope it offers is a paradoxical joke a time-loop into an infinite nirvana that is indistinguishable from extinction. I have little or no desire ever to watch ""Interstellar"" again and I dont feel that way at all about ""Tomorrowland"" which is exhilarating on every level. In positioning itself as a family film constitutionally forbidden to surrender to hopelessness Birds film actually poses a more radical challenge. We have no habitable planets to flee to and no galactic supercomputer will grant us immortality. To have hope at all we must stop dwelling on doom and imagine the alternatives. We must rescue our dreams of tomorrow however tarnished and ridiculous they may appear from the wreckage of today. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

""Tomorrowland"" and ""Gemma Bovery."" By Anthony Lane Britt Robertson and George Clooney in a new movie directed by Brad Bird.   Credit Illustration by Owen Freeman Time present and time past are both perhaps present in time future and time future contained in time past but Ill be damned if I can work out which is which. That is the upshot of ""Tomorrowland"" the new film from Brad Bird which starts with Frank Walker (George Clooney) revealing that ""when I was a kid the future was different."" We then loop back to that kidhood and to the eager young Frank (Thomas Robinson) attending the New York Worlds Fair in 1964 and lugging along a homemade jet pack--basically a modified vacuum cleaner with straps. He enters an inventors contest where the judge a man named Nix (Hugh Laurie) looks at the jet pack and inquires ""How would it make the world a better place?"" To which Frank replies ""Cant it just be fun?"" Nix has a wise and smiling child with him presumably his daughter. Her name aptly is Athena (Raffey Cassidy) and though not a functioning goddess she has talents that prove in the course of the film to be more than human. One of these is the ability to ferry souls to Tomorrowland a comely metropolis of sparkling towers and swooping pathways cheerily buzzed by airborne vehicles and staffed by genial citizens drawn from every band of the racial rainbow. The kind of joint in short where a jet pack fits right in. You can get there in several ways and Frank tries two of them. As a boy at the Worlds Fair following Athena he goes on a theme ride aboard a little boat that tips him downward through a vortex--shades of Alice and her trip to Wonderland in both the water and the fall. Later as an adult he uses a rocket that is cunningly concealed within the Eiffel Tower. The quickest route to Tomorrowland however comes at the touch of a button or to be exact of a magic lapel badge. Graze it with your finger and you find yourself amid a field of wheat staring at the radiant city in the distance much as Dorothy gazed at Oz. This is what happens to Casey (Britt Robertson) a high-school student in the present day. Her surname is Newton and in case we dont get the point we see her toss an apple through the air. Casey lives in Florida near a nasa launch site that is being demolished. The dismantling pains her so profoundly that she breaks in by night to sabotage it. On the strength of that resolve she is recruited by none other than Athena who shows up wondrously unaged and takes her to Frank now holed up in a farmhouse. What has befallen him in the intervening decades we dont discover but he has aged ungracefully so. Clooney is in full grumpy-shaggy mode--a look that we have seen before in ""Syriana"" but further rumpled here by a desperate paranoia. To be honest he looks miserable throughout the film as if badly wishing he were somewhere else. That glumness sits awkwardly in ""Tomorrowland"" which strives against the fad for dystopian sagas--""The Hunger Games"" ""Divergent"" and so forth--and bravely asks Where did all the utopias go? Brad Bird directed ""The Incredibles"" and ""Ratatouille"" before switching to live action for ""Mission Impossible--Ghost Protocol"" the larkiest of the sequels in that franchise. Eleven years old when men first landed on the moon Bird belongs to the generation for whom the lunar module was the shape of things to come. That is why beautiful shapes infest his new film the first half of which pops and whizzes with everything he does best. One sequence after another is streamlined and clean-cut and you sense that Bird has a genuine affection for gizmos not just because theyre cool but because they clear a path through the obstacles of life--because in short they work. Look at Casey sending a mini-drone over NASAs fence to mess with the security cameras; or the fiercely barking hologram that guards Franks house; or the bathtub that doubles as an escape pod hurtling skyward when he wants to get out in a rush. Even gizmos however need to lead somewhere and although ""Tomorrowland"" never runs out of objects or ideas its supply of dramatic fuel soon springs a leak. Bird co-wrote the film with Damon Lindelof who as addled viewers of ""Lost"" ""Prometheus"" and ""World War Z"" can attest is more concerned with setups than with payoffs. We get a flurry of chase sequences and a crunchy final showdown but you feel weirdly unbothered by the result. The only thing at stake appears to be the survival of the planet and thats always a cop-out. Give me ""The Incredibles"" any day with a single family to root for and a single baddie to boo. The hitch in the new film is that Tomorrowland itself is so fuzzily defined Is it a real destination? Is it a state of mind? No its a superconcept (Its also of course a zone that you can visit at Disneyland and ""Tomorrowland"" is a loyal Disney production.) Toward the end it falls to Hugh Laurie to keep a heroically straight face as he inveighs against the people of Earth ""They didnt fear their demise. They repackaged it."" Lord what fools these mortals be Thank heavens for Disney which is here to warn us against repackaging. Other evils the film suggests include civil strife and climate-change denial but our fragile race may yet be saved apparently by wind farms busking guitarists and paying attention in school. ""Tomorrowland"" is a bright and pliable sci-fi thriller that stiffens into a sermon. Cant it just be fun? There is little shame and less surprise in the fact that filmmakers have stumbled in their effort to bring the work of Flaubert to the screen. Even those of the first rank like Jean Renoir and Claude Chabrol have fallen short. One obstacle is the authors compositional mania which led him to cherish his commas in the way that ordinary people love their children. How easily that suppleness of sound patterned on the page can clog into visual fuss. Then theres the herd of largely uninteresting often unlikable folk whose fortunes we track in ""Madame Bovary"" and who would be alarmed to learn that they were the raw material of a masterpiece. No one wants to be the victim of a plot. How do you dramatize dullards weaklings and nincompoops and not wind up with a movie theatre full of gentle snoring? The latest director to make the attempt is Anne Fontaine who approaches the problem sideways. ""Gemma Bovery"" is an adaptation not of Flaubert but of a graphic novel by Posy Simmonds which toys with an unlikely resurrection of the story in the modern age. An English couple Charlie Bovery (Jason Flemyng) and his wife Gemma (Gemma Arterton) move to a delightful damp and mouse-ridden house in a small Normandy town. Their arrival is noted by Joubert (Fabrice Luchini) the local baker who lives across the street. He is a rabid Flaubertian and can scarcely believe that his treasured book is being staged anew as it were before his eyes. He dotes on Gemma corrects her French and schools her in the kneading of dough (""my yoga"" he calls it) although his ogling seems paltry when compared to that of the camera which carries out regular inspections of Artertons nape and breasts in a succession of summer frocks. Her character is vapid enough as the novel demands but anyone who hoped that Fontaine might unpick rather than fortify the male gaze is in for a letdown. Contrast the boldness with which Renoir in his movie of 1934 made Emma somewhat older and plainer than custom dictates and thereby made us reflect on the eyes of her beholders and on how provincial myopia can skew the moral vision. As Gemma goes through the motions of her fictional counterpart--boffing a blue blood in his faded chateau hatching an appointment in Rouen Cathedral and so on--we are offered a handful of sketchy observations on the extent to which art either does or does not mimic life. These are at best unchallenging and would have drawn barks of laughter from the derisive Flaubert. The only performer who seems at ease is Luchini eternally hangdog who in one juicy moment spies Gemma and her beau-to-be at a market stall and confesses not to envy but to ""a strange kind of jubilation"" at seeing Flauberts narrative lock into place. Such glee however pales beside the delicate daring of Francois Ozons ""In the House"" (2012) a study of similar fixations with Luchini as a literature teacher at the Lycee Gustave Flaubert. And that in turn is no match for ""The Kugelmass Episode"" written by Woody Allen for this magazine in 1977 which transports a balding henpecked humanities professor into the midst of ""Madame Bovary"" Emma turned in surprise. ""Goodness you startled me"" she said. ""Who are you?"" She spoke in the same fine English translation as the paperback. As for the ensuing scenes which spring Emma forward through time into a suite at the Plaza where she racks up room service and complains yet again of being bored (""Watching TV all day is the pits"")--well read the tale for yourself. Just once for a few delirious pages Flaubert got what he deserved.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

""Am I on?"" he wonders aloud. ""Hey Im Frank. Howre you doing? ... This is a story about the future and the future can be scary."" A young woman interrupts from off-camera ""Try to be a little more upbeat.""Related Story The State of 2015s Summer Movies Its hard to imagine a more accurate advertisement for the movie to come--a perfect proxy for the essential question posed by the blockbusters residing at the multiplex this weekend How do you like your apocalypse? If your tastes run to the arid and spiky to desolate post-nuclear landscapes populated by automotive marauders clashing over dwindling supplies of oil water blood breast milk and viable fetuses--then get yourself to Mad Max Fury Road immediately. (Or if youve already seen it get yourself back to it again.) But if you prefer your End of the World to be a little shinier more optimistic more Disney--it may be that Tomorrowland is just the ticket.That is not incidentally intended as an insult. Or at least not entirely as one. At its best Tomorrowland is a clever good-natured PG adventure featuring robots and ray guns jetpacks and Jules Verne. At its worst ... Well well get to that. Suffice it to say that Tomorrowland is considerably better than you might expect given that it is named after a region--not even a ride a region--within Disney Worlds Magic Kingdom and its associated theme parks around the globe. Does that conical dome in the distance bear a striking resemblance to Space Mountain? Why yes it does. (Remarkably this is not the first time Disney has offered up the same gag In the 2007 animated movie Meet the Robinsons a segment taking place decades in the future featured a Space-Mountain-y ride at a theme park called ""Todayland."")That the movie succeeds at all is a testament to the gifts of director Brad Bird (The Iron Giant The Incredibles Mission Impossible-Ghost Protocol) who keeps things rolling along amiably from a script he co-wrote with Damon Lindelof. Following Franks half-hearted self-introduction we get his backstory a boyhood visit to the 1964 Worlds Fair where he presents his homemade jetpack; an encounter with a peculiar young girl Athena (Raffey Cassidy) who tells him ""Im the future""; and a trip on the ""Its a Small World"" ride which debuted at that Worlds Fair and in which--I promise I am not making this up--young Frank discovers an inter-dimensional portal to a futuristic metropolis in the middle of a wheat field  featuring flying ""hover-rails"" and the aforementioned building that looks just like Space Mountain.If you prefer your End of the World to be a little shinier more optimistic more Disney--it may be that Tomorrowland is just the ticket.The movie soon switches gears however as the young woman we initially heard off-screen takes over narration duty from grownup Frank to tell her own backstory which is essentially the main plot. Her name is Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) and like the young Frank shes a precocious tech wiz. Her principal hobby however is sabotaging efforts to tear down the NASA launch pad at Cape Canaveral which for her offers a ray of hope for the future--reach for the stars--in a sea of contemporary pessimism. (Her high-school curriculum seems to consist exclusively of dismal warnings about global warming and nuclear Armageddon; even her English class teaches only Brave New World 1984 and Fahrenheit 451.) When Casey is picked up by police following another episode of vandalizing federal property she finds a vintage pin among her returned belongings--a pin that when she touches it transports her to the selfsame Tomorrowland where Frank traveled as a boy.Caseys journey is fleeting however and soon enough shes dumped back in our grubby compromised world desperate to return to her shiny utopia. Cue up the smilingly murderous robots the rendezvous with Frank--now grown into full Clooneyhood as a reclusive inventor--a visit to the Eiffel Tower (which is Not At All What You Think It Is) and so on. For much of its running time Tomorrowland plays as a lighthearted techno-conspiracy thriller Men in Black by way of Nancy Drew with the occasional whiff of Philip K. Dick paranoia and Pixarian high concept. And if the movie now and then bears a niggling resemblance to a theme park ride--well therein lies its genesis and quite possibly its future.Finally though Casey and Frank make their way back to Tomorrowland and the movies heady gee-whiz velocity largely gives way to a series of sententious sermons about hope and despair the abiding importance of imagination etc. etc. Is the Earth--our Earth--truly doomed to destruction? Why was Frank expelled from Tomorrowland long ago? What was that video he and Casey were making at the beginning of the movie? If youre like me you might feel that some of these mysteries might have been better left unsolved.In an unintentionally telling moment Frank exasperated by Caseys constant inquiries asks her ""Do I have to explain everything? Cant you just be amazed and move on?"" If only Tomorrowland had heeded his sage advice.

""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you.

Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history.

He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed.

The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

Do our Facebook posts reflect our true personalities? Incrementally probably not. But in aggregate the things we say on social media paint a fairly accurate portrait of our inner selves. A team of University of Pennsylvania scientists is using Facebook status updates to find commonalities in the words used by different ages genders and even psyches. The so-called ""World Well-Being Project"" started as an effort to gauge happiness across various states and communities. ""Governments have an increased interest in measuring not just economic outcomes but other aspects of well-being"" said Andrew Schwartz a UPenn computer scientist who works on the project. ""But its very difficult to study well-being at a large scale. It costs a lot of money to administer surveys to see how people are doing in certain areas. Social media can help with that.""

She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s.

Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

"Tomorrowland | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; tomorrowland ) Tomorrowland (United States 2015) May 21 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Tomorrowland is an interesting collage of moments and ideas in search of a strong narrative and a coherent ending. For a while it doesnt matter that the plot meanders. The story seems like a jigsaw puzzle inviting us to solve it. Thats the fun part. However when the resolution is presented it underwhelms. And by the time two Rockem Sockem robots go at it it has become apparent that the filmmakers dont quite know how to bring this odyssey to a satisfying conclusion. The final scenes dont make a lot of sense and transform whats an otherwise imaginative motion picture into another summer disappointment. This is more art house film than mainstream fare although a few action scenes have been added to increase the multiplex appeal. At its heart however Tomorrowland is a meditation on how humanitys views of the future are in a state of constant flux. It focuses on our unending affair with the apocalypse. The concept of mass extinction doesnt frighten us; it forms an entertainment cornerstone. In the end the movie is about saving humanity from itself and convincing us that Armageddon isnt an inevitability. It takes about 30 minutes before were able to start piecing together the fragments of the story writer/director Brad Bird and his co-scribe Damon Lindelof provide us with. The young bright-eyed inventive boy we first meet at the Worlds Fair in 1964 has grown up to become the disillusioned inventor Frank Walker (George Clooney). He has seen the future and knows with 100% certainty that its bleak. Offering a counterpoint to Franks worldview is Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) who refuses to take off her rose-colored glasses. She believes in hope light and the promise of a better tomorrow. Both Frank and Casey visit the amazing world of Tomorrowland - a utopia for scientists and idealists that exists in another reality - but at different times and for different reasons. Casey is desperate to go back and Frank never wants to return. The only thing the two of them have in common is an android girl named Athena (Raffey Cassidy) who intuits that the fate of the world rests with them both. Perhaps I have arrived at this realization later than everyone else but I dont think Lindelof (Lost) knows how to end things. For most of its running length Tomorrowland is a sublime science fiction experience. The visuals are impressive the mystery keeps us involved and the characters are likeable.  There are some minor issues - the film tries a little too hard to explain unexplainable things like time travel (tachyons) and the relationship between Frank and Athena could have been explored more deeply - but I was enjoying the ride... until the final fifteen minutes. I cant exempt Bird from the criticism but his previous track record is solid; I was expecting more from the director of such fine movies as The Iron Giant The Incredibles and Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol. Steven Spielbergs influence permeates Tomorrowland. This is the kind of movie a younger pre-Schindlers List Spielberg might have made. Its more Hook than Close Encounters but theres little doubt what Bird was aiming for; as homages go this ones not as successful as J.J. Abrams Super 8. The Disney halo is also in evidence. Not only is the film named after one of The Magic Kingdoms most popular areas (although any connection beyond the title and a few visual cues is tenuous) but there are plenty of references to Disneys newest property (Star Wars). George Clooney slides into a role that perhaps only he and Tom Hanks could play with such seeming effortlessness. We instantly like him because hes George Clooney even though Frank is a bit of a curmudgeon. The film doesnt require much in the way of acting from Clooney; his reliable presence is enough. Britt Robertson impresses more here than in her recent Nicholas Sparks appearance. Raffey Cassidy a young British actress with (mostly) TV experience has no trouble holding her own in scenes with Clooney. Vestiges of House cling to Hugh Laurie in his role as Tomorrowlands Governor Nix. It almost pains me not to recommend Tomorrowland. The movie is unlike most mass produced films. Its approach is unhurried and the tone finds a pleasing mix of whimsy humor and seriousness. It touches on childhood nostalgia and brings a smile to our faces as we consider the inaccuracies of an earlier generations prognostications about the future. Its unfortunate however that the same care wasnt put into the final 20 minutes that was lavished on the first 110. That failure makes Tomorrowland more frustrating than bad but a disappointment nevertheless.

ROBERT SIEGEL HOST For decades Tomorrowland has been a Disney theme park area. And now like the Disney ride Pirates of the Caribbean it has lent its name to a big-budget movie. Bob Mondello says the movie version of Tomorrowland is designed just like its theme park namesake to celebrate optimism. BOB MONDELLO Near the outset of ""Tomorrowland"" a teenager named Casey sneaks into Cape Canaveral in the middle of the night to disable the cranes that are dismantling the launch pad there. She hates the idea that NASA is giving up on space travel and while her little act of sabotage gets her arrested her enthusiasm for futile gestures gets her noticed by someone besides the police someone who slipped something in with the belongings she gets back when shes released from jail. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""TOMORROWLAND"") UNIDENTIFIED MAN 1 (As police officer) One money clip 47.32 one Florida state drivers license one pack of Beemans gum and whatever that is. MONDELLO That is a pin with the letter T on it presumably for Tomorrowland - not the theme park the real place. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""TOMORROWLAND"") BRITT ROBERTSON (As Casey Newton) Thats not mine. UNIDENTIFIED MAN 1 (As police officer) Whats not yours? ROBERTSON (As Casey Newton) The pin. MONDELLO She touches it. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""TOMORROWLAND"") ROBERTSON (As Casey Newton) Ive never - (screaming). MONDELLO And suddenly shes in a golden field of wheat stretching to the horizon and a glittering city. Is it Oz? No Disney already went there. Anyway Caseys thrilled by this shiny happy place with its floating trains and shimmering skyscrapers and a kind of synchronized diving where its the swimming pools that are synchronized not the divers. Whered the T pin come from she wonders. Is any of this real? Is it the future maybe? Then after a few minutes of visual enchantment the T pin stops working and in a sense so does the movie which is not to say nothing else happens. Casey will join forces with a girl whos sort of an adolescent Mary Poppins and a one-time boy inventor whos grown-up to be a cranky old coot played by George Clooney. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""TOMORROWLAND"") GEORGE CLOONEY (As Frank Walker) Come on. MONDELLO Together these three will have noisy frantic adventures at the Eiffel Tower and a movie memorabilia store and a booby-trapped house. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""TOMORROWLAND"") CLOONEY (As Frank Walker) Get in. ROBERTSON (As Casey Newton) How is this a good idea? MONDELLO Each location envisioned in theme-park-friendly ways but pretty early on the sense of fun in their carousing... (SOUNDBITE OF FILM ""TOMORROWLAND"") CLOONEY (As Frank Walker) Hang on. MONDELLO ...Starts getting swamped by a message that director Brad Bird seems determined to state and restate until the dimmest 10-year-old in the audience gets it - the message that there is simply not enough optimism in the world that humanity has become apathetic cynical discouraged and that weve really got to snap out of it because by simply dreaming big we could fix the worlds problems. This is lets note more sloganeering than imagineering but let that pass. The sentiments are certainly admirable and are no doubt heartfelt and are delivered so insistently and passionately that while ""Tomorrowlands"" sermonizing left me feeling grumpy and feeling a little guilty for feeling grumpy it may well have an entirely different effect on impressionable children who are after all its target audience. I wouldnt be surprised if they emerge inspired by a sense of purpose they did not have on the way in and a mission to get one of those T pins. Im Bob Mondello.

"Edge of Tomorrowland An Amusement Park Inspires a Movie Thats More Mad Tea Party Than Space Mountain << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Edge of Tomorrowland An Amusement Park Inspires a Movie Thats More Mad Tea Party Than Space Mountain Disney Movies May 22 2015 by Alex Pappademas Facebook Twitter Print Last week the summers first great blockbuster suggested that men will kill the world; this week in Brad Birds Tomorrowland a young woman races to save it with a little help from George Clooney. The movie is an earnest attempt to reverse-imagineer an emotionally resonant backstory for a section of Disneyland (and its various offshoot parks from Orlando to Hong Kong) thats never had characters or a narrative to call its own. It brings a big soft in-the-right-place heart to the not wholly altruistic work of personalizing and deepening our relationship with a family of global brands.1 The values that Bird and co-screenwriter Damon Lindelof posit as Tomorrowlands and by extension Disneys are hard to argue with. Tomorrowland lionizes builders and engineers and yea-sayers and the dreamers of dreams and implies that our largely pop-culture-fed defeatism about the future -- embodied onscreen by several conspicuously placed billboards for an apocalyptic scary movie called ToxiCosmos 3 Nowhere to Go -- might be a form of spiritual global warming with immediate and destructive consequences. Plus by putting a female prodigy at the center of a story that would undoubtedly have been about a Very Special Boy had it been made even a decade ago the movie takes a monkey wrench to the assumptions underpinning tech-bro chauvinism. Disney Sure the delivery system for these laudable messages is a two-hour-plus brand-identity spot a corporate-communications grand slam whose bold idealism is inextricably entangled with a sales pitch -- but in a sense so was the part of Disneyland its based on. Construction on Tomorrowland began only six months before the park opened in 1955. By then Walt Disney -- whod embarked on the Disneyland project over the objections of his brother Roy Disneys CEO -- had run through most of his 17 million budget so Tomorrowlands utopian/inspirational vision of far-off 1986 ended up featuring attractions underwritten by American Motors GE Goodyear Bell Telephone Richfield Oil the American Dairy Association TWA Kaiser Aluminum and Monsanto Company whose all-plastic House of the Future invited park-goers to marvel at an ""Atoms for Living Kitchen"" with a ""revolutionary"" microwave oven. Theres historical precedent in other words for the moment late in the film when a montage of makers and fixers and artists and tree-planters and cockeyed optimists lingers on an industrial designer hard at work on the 2016 Chevy Volt.  In the fourth-season finale of Mad Men Don Draper brings his secretary Megan Calvet along on a trip to Disneyland for child-care purposes and ends up proposing to her out of nowhere; Matthew Weiner and cowriter Jonathan Igla called the episode ""Tomorrowland"" so that we wouldnt miss the implication that Don was high on his own supply of fresh-start fantasies. Megan and the Drapers visited in 1965; Tomorrowland got the first of many face-lifts two years later. For years Tomorrowland was problematic from a theme-park-upkeep standpoint and fascinating from a semiotic one because it inevitably memorialized a vision of the future as seen from the past. In 1998 Disneyland unveiled a refurbished Tomorrowland that attempted to turn this bug into a feature taking visual cues from the retro Jules Verne/H.G. Wells look of Euro Disneys Discoveryland to create a ""classic future environment."" This reboot has a New Coke reputation among Disneyland aficionados but at least it was a look -- these days the Tomorrowland in Anaheim is the most cluttered crowded airport-terminalish part of the park. Space Mountain and Buzz Lightyears Astro Blasters still pack em in but theres not even a hint of prognostication unless you count the suspiciously todayish touch-screen developments on display in the Microsoft/HP/Taylor Morrison-sponsored Innoventions Dream Home itself shuttered this past March. No future for you except the seemingly inevitable one where all this prime real estate is overtaken by new Star Wars and Marvel rides. Were doing a little cosmetic surgery on TOMORROWLAND in the Disney parks. Were starting small... trashcans first pic.twitter.com/LwqlTuYjvo -- Brad Bird (BradBirdA113) April 17 2015 The problem with Tomorrowland isnt that its a movie about Walt Disneys highest ideals that cant help also being an advertisement for Disneyland; its that it just isnt much of a movie. It takes some cool chase-scene set pieces and some admirable articulations of unfashionable positivity and spackles the gaps between them by having people deliver nudge-winky shorthand lines like ""Its important -- they need to know the stakes"" and ""Time was running out and you needed motivation"" and ""Do I have to explain everything? Cant you just be amazed and move on?"" (Also at one point its explained that weve abandoned the space program because ""its hard to have ideas and easy to give up""; at that point a part of me also gave up.) Bird and Lindelof share story credit with Entertainment Weekly writer Jeff Jensen who caught Lindelofs eye with his grandly theoretical close readings of Lost episodes and is therefore the TV-recapping equivalent of The Last Starfighter. The conceit of the script is that Tomorrowland is an actual place -- a parallel universe the worlds best and brightest created so that they could find each other and work to better society in an environment ""free of politics or bureaucracy."" The idea of a gleaming realm outside time where the elite meet to invent the future unhampered by legislative oversight -- an extradimensional TED or Davos for the successors of a secret society the film calls the Plus Ultra -- is pretty much exactly what youd expect from a collaboration between one of the puzzlemasters of Lost and the director of the crypto-Objectivist childrens classic The Incredibles. You never know who wrote what in a movie like this but when an iconic monument turns out to conceal a steampunk Mission Control complete with scrolling-hieroglyph readouts it feels like pure Lindelof; and when an electromagnetic pulse blacks out an entire city of mobile-device-clutching sheeple leaving only a brightly glowing rocket carrying geniuses to their appointed world-saving mission it feels like Ayn Rand. To its credit the film does allow for the possibility that even a special club for awesome people might make the occasional mistake born of Promethean arrogance personified here by Hugh Lauries cynical Governor Nix. And its not as if Rand invented the idea of great spirits encountering resistance from mediocre minds. Disney In Tomorrowland the spirit is young Casey played with a realistic balance of pluck and petulance by Under the Domes Britt Robertson. When we first see Casey shes using a toy helicopter to conduct drone warfare on the cranes poised to disassemble a Cape Canaveral launch platform and throw her NASA-engineer single father (Tim McGraw) out of work. Everything else we need to know about her comes through in a sequence in which Casey squirming through her teachers lectures on dystopia climate change and mutually assured destruction keeps raising her hand to ask the same question ""Can we fix it?"" Shes a spiritual cousin to the astrophysics-obsessed Murph in Interstellar who gets suspended for telling other kids the truth about the moon landing and grows up to be Jessica Chastain solver of impossible equations. Its been a good half-year for movies about smart girls who love science as much as they love their dads. The fact that Casey is a driven irrepressible maker-builder type with no stereotypically girly qualities is undeniably cool and progressive; the fact that a movie conceived by the studio most responsible for perpetuating the princess-industrial complex treats this as a normal and even unremarkable way for a girl to be even sparing her the distraction of a love interest is even cooler. Of course Tomorrowland doesnt exactly smash the binary between pink and blue It renders Caseys life choices plausible by sealing off traditional femininity as an option. Technology is still ultimately portrayed as a mans world albeit one that cant ignore someone of Caseys acumen; theres nothing in this film as quietly revolutionary as the scene in the Halt and Catch Fire pilot when a daughter watches her mother rewire a Speak amp; Spell. Believers in Disneys alleged conspiracy against moms wont be surprised to learn that adult women basically dont exist in this story at all except for one caricature-ish teacher and Kathryn Hahn who shows up behind the counter along with Keegan-Michael Key when Casey stumbles into a sci-fi memorabilia shop looking for answers in a scene that feels lifted from a sillier and perhaps better movie. By that point shes already found a techno-magical T-shaped pin and glimpsed the spires and hover-trams and happy pointedly diverse pedestrian crowds of the world to come in an affecting sequence that plays out as much on Caseys delighted face as it does on the CGI castles in the air. Its a while longer before she finally encounters reclusive tinkerer Frank Walker (Clooney) wholl become Caseys grumpy guide on the path to destiny. Of all the things this film asks us to believe the notion of George Clooney as an apparently monkish bachelor who never got over the girl he met at the 64 Worlds Fair is the hardest to accept. Walker is barred from Tomorrowland for irresponsible inventing; the room where he obsesses over a wall of bad-news feeds is sort of the Disney version of the apartment where Losts Matthew Fox grew a playoff beard and tried in vain to plot a return to the Island in between driving around Los Angeles popping pills and listening to In Utero. Clooneys performance has a nice underplayed Henry Fonda quality with a soupcon of Nick Nolte every time something makes him say Aww hell. Which is often. Eventually we get your basic confrontation between protagonists and antagonists with the world hanging in the balance -- which feels a little rushed after all the chasing that led us here although theres a cool robot involved -- and then a coda whose specific emotional resonance will feel familiar if youve ever been tricked into tearing up at what turns out to be a commercial for a new energy-efficient light bulb. Before that theres a minor twist I took as a surprisingly sharp elbow thrown at Hollywood where some of the worlds best and brightest minds join forces to devise ever-more-realistic and terrifying depictions of cataclysm a meta film-critical touch that will undoubtedly seem that much more ironic when Tomorrowland gets knocked off the top of the box office heap by San Andreas next weekend. We like apocalyptic futures one character says because they ask nothing of us; Tomorrowland cant quite sell the alternative but at least it dares to imagine something different. Speaking of I should probably get the customary disclosures out of the way sooner rather than later in this case. Disney Parks is a division of the Walt Disney Company as is ESPN. Writing about this particular movie in this space feels not unlike reviewing National Lampoons Vacation for a publication staked by Marty Moose.

Film Frame/Disney/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide I suppose we should be thankful that for a change a great big summer blockbuster has arrived that isnt chockablock with comic-book superheroes or buzzcut maxi-muscled marauders. ""Tomorrowland"" is a rather sweet excursion into speculative sci-fi and wonder of wonders it doesnt even seemed primed for a sequel. But this movie about the thrill of the visionary is alas mostly earthbound.Directed and co-written (with Damon Lindelof and Jeff Jensen) by Brad Bird who made the marvelous animated features ""The Iron Giant"" and ""The Incredibles"" the film centers on Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) a precocious Texas teen whose dad (Tim McGraw) was once a NASA engineer at a rocket launch site. Now to her horror the site is being demolished.Casey becomes the recipient of a mysterious pin with a big ""T"" emblem which briefly enables her to enter what appears to be a model city of the future complete with model people. Back home in the present she is soon aided by a benevolent pre-teen bot (Raffey Cassidy) and pursued by bot meanies ending up paired with Frank Walker (George Clooney) an ornery hermit scientist who may hold the key to a return trip to Tomorrowland. This is assuming it exists at all and is not a wish-fulfillment fantasy. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Considering that Bird comes out of animation the visuals in this movie are for the most part surprisingly prosaic (like something out of maybe ""Spy Kids."") A vision of the resplendent (or not-so-resplendent) future ought to carry more oomph than this. Still there are compensations Robertson and Cassidy are spunky and Clooney is amusingly grizzled and theres a marvelous set piece where the middle of the Eiffel Tower suddenly turns into a great big rocket shooting into the night sky. The films eco-friendly concerns and general tone of messianic optimism are welcome. ""Tomorrowland"" is really a civics lesson disguised as a summer escape flick. Grade B- (Rated PG for sequences of sci-fi action violence and peril thematic elements and language.)

It confronts things we as a people a nation a species dont want to confront. And thats the point.As a Disney movie it inevitably sides with the positive. What else would Mickey do? But it brings the hammer and poses big difficult and disturbing questions. Beyond that it dares not to offer up superheroes as answers. It offers only ... us.Now as to what ""Tomorrowland"" is actually about. Well thats kind of tough.Casey (Britt Robertson) is a teen girl whos something of an engineering wiz which isnt surprising since her dad (Tim McGraw) works for NASA. She dreams of flying into space; unfortunately federal budget cuts have the rocket launching pad at Cape Canaveral where they live being torn down.But then Casey comes into possession of a tiny pin with the letter T on it. Whenever she touches it her mind is transported to some futuristic city where hovercraft shoot about and people swim in pools suspended in air and rockets regularly take trips to destinations light years away.Unfortunately Casey soon finds out that her magic pin draws dangerous people who try to kill her for having it. Just as shes being targeted a young girl Athena (Raffey Cassidy just try to forget her) appears and turns out to be a fighting machine. She helps Casey escape and drives her to the home of Frank Walker (George Clooney) a recluse who once had a pin of his own.Athena thinks Casey has a gift and its a gift that may with Walkers help enable her to save that futuristic utopia Tomorrowland and her own besieged Mother Earth.Going past there in terms of plot would be criminal. There are too many surprises in this movie to undermine. Suffice it to say the script by ""Lost"" alum Damon Lindelof director Brad Bird and Jeff Jensen pits hope and optimism -- and work -- against despair and doom. Despair is embodied in the leader of Tomorrowland the appropriately named Nix (Hugh Laurie); hope energy and innovation is what Casey brings to the party.The thing is Nix -- especially in a summarizing monologue -- makes a scary amount of sense. This is a world in which obesity and starvation are epidemic. What does that say about things? Our government is paralyzed society is split religious wars abound and nuclear proliferation and climate change are all but ignored by those in power.Which sounds like dark stuff and it certainly is. But director Bird (""The Incredibles"" ""Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol"") is such a master of momentum and has such a way with gadgetry that the films two-plus hours whiz by with elements of ""The Terminator"" ""Hugo"" ""The Rocketeer"" ""The Wizard of Oz"" and countless other films flashing past. Hes tackling serious subject matter in a fun way; when does that happen?""Tomorrowland"" is rated PG but it will likely fly right over kids younger than age 8. For anyone older though -- and this includes you parents and grandparents -- this should be required viewing. Come for the humor and thrills and visual delights -- there are many. Leave with the thought in your head We can we need to do better. This is summer moviemaking at its best.tlongdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/toomuchtomlongTomorrowlandGRADE ARated PG for sequences of sci-fi action violence and peril thematic elements and languageRunning time 130 minutes 33 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 7 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1SlmzdK MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/05/22/movie-review-tomorrowland-full-laughs-sci-fi-hijinks/27731171/,200,tomorrowland11,tomorrowland,detroitnews

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Something moving if mildly sappy happens in the waning minutes of ""Tomorrowland."" Now if only all of director Brad Birds fantasy adventure had lived up to its promise. But isnt that often the way with the future the subject of this Disney mega-ride? Such grand hopes -- such gifted talent -- not quite met. George Clooney stars as Frank Walker a jaded reclusive inventor who is tracked down by a driven teen named Casey after she experiences some truly weird space-time events. Caseys last name is Newton. And Sir Isaac could do worse. Played by Britt Robertson shes a whip-smart curious science-minded problem-solver. One of the more laudable things about this fantasy yarn is that Casey is brainy in a terrifically adventurous get-in-a-bit-of-hot-water way. Case in point She breaks into a NASA facility that soon to be shuttered will leave her beloved engineer father (Tim McGraw) without his space-program job. While in custody she comes across a mysterious pin that when touched transports her to the hidden realm of the movies title. Bird and his small country of visual-effects whizzes have great slapstick fun as Casey touches lets go touches and lets go of the pin. REACTION SHOT Watch Lisa Kennedys review of ""Tomorrowland"" More than a few writers have observed that the best cynics are bitterly disappointed optimists. Franks that guy. ""Tomorrowland"" is a story of pessimism (his) and optimism (hers) of humankinds end or triumph. It uses the kind of newsreel footage that has become a staple of many dystopian tales famine war environmental disaster and so on. But it does so in a hurry and in the context of Franks crabby account. But lets go back in time for a moment -- as futurist films are fond of doing. Co-written by Bird and Damon Lindelof (""Star Trek"" and ""Lost"") the movie begins willfully hokey and hopeful. Young Frank (Thomas Robinson) travels to the 1964 Worlds Fair in Queens N.Y. In an oversize rucksack hes lugged a jetpack he takes to the inventions pavilion. His creation goes horizontally with zip but vertically not so much. There Frank meets scientist David Nix (Hugh Laurie) and a brilliant girl named Athena (an engagingly crisp Raffey Cassidy) who figures mightily in Franks introduction to the clandestine mecca of possibility envisioned by a quartet of pragmatic dreamers Gustave Eiffel Jules Verne Thomas Edison and his rival Nikola Tesla. Its heady company to be sure. And ""Tomorrowland"" aims for the kind of storytelling that can tease disaster while trying to maintain a cheery can-do outlook. Not an easy goal. Bird directed two of Pixars most inventive and emotionally challenging features ""The Incredibles"" and Oscar winner ""Ratatouille."" It makes sense hed be the one to take on a story that straddles anxiety and hope in a family-friendly movie. Only something goes awry. What starts off with visual cues that promise the pleasures of ""The Wizard of Oz"" or Steven Spielbergs space-celebrating films turns into a bloated action fantasy more along the lines of ""Jumanji."" While that may sound just fine to some its a missed opportunity here. ""Tomorrowland"" recaptures some of its grandest ambitions about possibilitys protagonists late with a sentimental flourish. Granted one I was surprised to be touched by. Cue the music. All together now ""Its a schmaltz world after all.""

"Tomorrowland (PG) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Tomorrowland (PG) George Clooney stars in Disneys kid-friendly sci-fi spectacle directed by Brad Bird. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com5/21/2015 Editor rating 3 Tomorrowland is a crazy disjointed mess. But its the good sort of crazy and the kind of mess you want to lose yourself in like the paint-splattered studio of an artist who has been on a mad creative tear cranking out crazy pieces that you cant stop poring over. This is the fifth movie former Pixar superstar Brad Bird (The Incredibles Ratatouille) has directed but its only his second live-action picture (his first was Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol) and it feels personal in a way most big blockbusters dont. This one really is from the heart even though the title implies another feature-length ad for a Disney theme park attraction. Bird who conceived the original premise with Damon Lindelof (Lost Prometheus) and Jeff Jensen (a longtime writer for Entertainment Weekly) thinks primarily in visuals the way the best filmmakers do and his collaboration with cinematographer Claudio Miranda (Fight Club Life of Pi) has paid off with such gorgeous imaginative images that Disney didnt even bother to release a 3D version. The movie springs forth from the screen with a striking radiant beauty that feels organic instead of fussed-over. Its pure sci-fi with giant robots and gleaming spaceships but it also breathes and feels real. Bird also brings the techniques he learned making animation to bear on the film the same way George Miller (Happy Feet) did with Mad Max Fury Road. Theres a thrilling clarity to the action -- whether its a boy careening through the air strapped to an out-of-control jetpack or the Eiffel Tower splitting vertically in half to reveal an ancient rocketship -- that is a salve for the eyeball-gouging style that has become the unfortunate standard in Hollywood. Tomorrowland trades on nostalgia but it channels it too Its a high-tech polished marvel of old-school artistry. If Walt Disney had had CGI technology available to him in the 1950s this is how he would have used it. Disney might have also ordered a few more script polishes as well as demanded some cuts. At 130 minutes Tomorrowland makes for an awfully long kids movie and adults will also shift in their seats during some of the films duller patches. The opening scenes are troubling starting off with an alarmingly cutesy battle of dual voice-over narrations by the inventor Frank Walker (George Clooney) and a teenage girl Casey (Britt Robertson) as they talk about the future while a digital clock counts down to something. A flashback to the 1964 New York City Worlds Fair in which a young Frank (played by Thomas Robinson) submits his science project to a stern judge (Hugh Laurie) and befriends an intriguing girl (Raffey Cassidy) does nothing to put you at ease. During a worrisome ride on the Its a Small World attraction (a scene that could send more than a few Floridians scrambling for the exits shouting ""Not again"") Bird unleashes his first big surprise which is terrific except that it leads to an even more troubling vista. Yes that is Space Mountain visible in the background (not for the last time either). But any trepidations that youve been tricked into seeing a movie designed to make your kids clamor for another visit to the Magic Kingdom dissipate soon. The plot of Tomorrowland is so tangled the early descriptions of the movie as ""Interstellar for kids"" dont go far enough. Like all time-travel adventures this one has plenty of mind-bending loops and the way the story is intentionally structured youre not entirely sure whats happening until the final 30 minutes. Even then you will have questions I will admit to being completely confused by the time characters started slinging around words such as ""tachyons"" and the dreaded ""relativity"" and the movie was almost over. I was even tempted to lean over and ask the little boy sitting next to me at the screening to explain because he seemed to be understand everything. But he was so rapt leaning forward in his seat I decided not to bother him. Yes Tomorrowland is probably too obtuse for its own good Theres a big difference between a slow reveal that generates curiosity and suspense and a third-act exposition dump to explain everything youve been watching (that final half-hour which has at least one speech too many bears the distinct imprint of Lindelof whose scripts often suffer from this problem). But to concentrate on Tomorrowlands narrative flaws or its unabashedly earnest message -- its easier to sit back and be pessimistic about the state of the world than to do something about it -- is to miss the giant wondrous spectacle in front of you such as a scene aboard an open-air elevator in which the protagonists can see whats going to happen to them five seconds in the future (reading that might make your brain hurt but Bird sells the concept with ease). At least one sequence in the film will go down as one of the years best setpieces A sudden laser-gun showdown between one of the protagonists and the two clerks at a cluttered movie memorabilia store in which Bird manages to squeeze in visual homages to practically every science-fiction picture you can think of (as well as his underrated gem The Iron Giant). Confusion never gets in the way of Birds main attraction which is deft thrilling moviemaking including the requisite yet still astonishing scene done in one long sustained take. Scorsese would approve. Theres so much going on in Tomorrowland you dont even notice Clooney doesnt properly enter the show until an hour in. Before then the movie does just fine following the duo of Robertson and Cassidy two gifted and charismatic young actresses whose terrific performances imply they dont seem to be aware theyre acting in a childrens film. Go ahead and mock Tomorrowland if you want for its feel-good sunshine-in-wheat-fields ending which brings to mind the famous Coca-Cola commercial that brought Mad Men to a close last week. But theres so much genuine wonder to go along with the sap only the most heinous of Disney villains could hate this movie outright. Tomorrowland may or may not connect with family audiences -- its a strange film and at times a bit violent although always bloodless. But the movie proves if there was still any doubt Bird is a contender. Somewhere Walt Disney is smiling. Cast George Clooney Hugh Laurie Britt Robertson Raffey Cassidy Thomas Robinson Tim McGraw Kathryn Hahn. Director Brad Bird. Screenwriters Damon Lindelof Brad Bird. A Walt Disney Pictures release. Running time 130 minutes. Sci-fi violence brief disturbing imagery. Playing at area theaters.

Close Join the conversation... With GuideLive Contributor Share This Story Share Discuss Meh Tomorrowland director Brad Bird has spent most of his career in animation with titles including The Iron Giant The Incredibles and Ratatouille to his name. Tomorrowland is only his second live-action feature after 2011s Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol. With each of his previous films Bird created something original and satisfying combining a sense of play and invention with heart and sincerity. But with Tomorrowland which he co-wrote with Damon Lindelof (Lost The Leftovers) hes crafted an overly busy film that can at times be unbearably preachy.At the films heart is a single question What if we could actually do something about war poverty global warming and the worlds other ills? Thats what the bright celestial city of the title was built for. Situated in another dimension it was meant to be a place where the worlds best thinkers inventors and artists could generate life-changing solutions that would better the world and all mankind. Tomorrowland reminds us of the importance of original sci-fi But if Tomorrowland is about saving the world and the human race its also about saving this ideal citadel from the destructive power of pessimism.That job falls to Casey Newton. Played with passion and curiosity by Britt Robertson Casey is a bright girl who wants to change the world and a self-described optimist. When a mysterious pin from the 1964 Worlds Fair introduces her to the gleaming city from another time and place she directs all her energy into finding it.Her search takes her to the reclusive inventor Frank Walker (George Clooney). Frank was a boy when he first gained entrance to Tomorrowland. And while he once called it home he was ousted years ago and forbidden to return. But now with Casey on his doorstep he has to find a way back and confront both old memories and Governor Nix (Hugh Laurie). Nix rules Tomorrowland with an iron fist. Like the other characters he wants to save the world but instead of using hope to inspire change hes trying to save it through fear. This photo released by Disney shows George Clooney as Frank Walker in a scene from Disneys ""Tomorrowland."" The film releases in U.S. theaters May 22 2015. Film Frame/AP The battle between the movies heroes - whose ranks also include Athena a robot programmed to find recruits for Tomorrowland - and Nix is framed as a battle between good and evil. But it feels like the real message of Tomorrowland is something more trite Lets all just stay positive. Harmony and innovation are great but the power of positive thinking is even more potent. Thats certainly an honorable position but Bird and Lindelof all but issue a secular altar call to the audience inviting us all to drop what were doing and change the world. It would have been better if theyd listened to an early line of dialogue in their own film Its OK if something doesnt change the world as long as its fun.By Andrew Welch Special Contributor Goes Well With...

DisneyFrank Walker (George Clooney) is a former boy genius whos now a reclusive inventor in ""Tomorrowland.""(Photo Disney)The only way Tomorrowland could be a more ""Disney"" Disney movie is if Walt Disneys supposedly frozen head was an executive producer.It isnt but director Brad Bird (The Incredibles) and screenwriter Damon Lindelof (Lost) are in charge of this family-friendly action adventure which resembles its theme-park title. Tomorrowland (   out of four; rated PG; opens Friday nationwide) is a spectacular ride for most of it and while youre a little let down at the end you kind of want to jump back on and do it all over again.USA TODAYGeorge Clooney takes us to TomorrowlandBritt Robertson is Casey Newton a Cape Canaveral kid and science whiz who gets in trouble for trying to slow down the dismantling of a NASA project one thats keeping her engineer dad (Tim McGraw) employed. After a few hours in jail she comes in contact with a retro-cool pin emblazoned with a ""T"" and when Casey touches it shes transported to a wondrous future utopia.This is obviously Tomorrowland a place founded so all the brightest minds on Earth could have somewhere to work think and be awesome without bureaucracy and other obstacles slowing them down.Its not quite what it once was and Casey discovers that shes the person who can fix it. Her journey finds her befriending an enigmatic freckle-faced youngster named Athena (Raffey Cassidy) the keeper of these magical pins and Frank Walker (George Clooney) a boy genius who grew up to be an antisocial shut-in.USA TODAYBird Lindelof take Clooney to TomorrowlandAs a kid Frank was exposed to Tomorrowland after a fateful trip to the 1964 Worlds Fair but later kicked out -- the main reason why Frank is so crotchety in his later years. Yet he also has a vested interest in seeing Casey get to Tomorrowland and make everything right.The movie is very much a nostalgia trip. When young Frank (Thomas Robinson) is zooming around Tomorrowland in his homemade jetpack there are shades of The Rocketeer a sense of wide-eyed wonderment not seen much since Steven Spielbergs 1980s heyday and even the ""kids are smart adults are dumb"" theme of E.T. and The Goonies.Had this come out 30 years ago it would be every childs favorite movie and Bird and Lindelof seem to recognize as much They fill a whole store with yesteryear items including a lifesize Han Solo in carbonite that would have been in a Gen Xers dream bedroom as a tyke.Casey (Britt Robertson) witnesses the wonders of a futuristic city in Tomorrowland. (Photo Disney)Still Tomorrowland only really blasts off when the unlikely trio of Casey Athena and Frank find each other and their world-spanning quest includes escaping pesky humanoid robots via a bathtub and finding a new use for the Eiffel Tower.Robertson gives Casey the needed amount of teen moxie without being obnoxious Clooney exudes charisma even under a pile of gruff but the real revelation here is Cassidy a British newcomer who plays Athena as an entertaining blend of Hermione Granger Bruce Lee and The Doctor of Doctor Who fame.USA TODAYPixar fans rejoice Director Brad Bird confirms hes working on Incredibles 2 nextWhere the film falls apart a bit is in its messaging which boils down to the younger generation needing to step up where the old folks have failed. The theme is somewhat subtle in the first half of the film The real world is pretty much a cornucopia of contemporary doom compared with Tomorrowland a pristine place where diversity rules and everybody is overly nice to each other. (The locale is made even grander by Michael Giacchinos glorious score.)But the point is sledgehammered home -- and in megalomaniacal fashion -- by the villain of the piece near the end a gift-wrapped denouement thats emotional yet leaves viewers feeling as if they were suddenly left off at the souvenir shop.Cynics might think Tomorrowland is just a cinematic set-up for a new ride at Disney World -- and Uncle Franks Magical Bathtub Explosion would sit well between Space Mountain and Cosmic Rays Starlight Cafe.For enthusiastic youngsters and the young at heart however the film is done well enough that its hard not to get swept up in the visual spectacle and the thought that the future is literally at ones fingertips. 66 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1SkHQEg",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/05/21/tomorrowland-movie-review/27578055/,200,tomorrowland16,tomorrowland,usatoday

"Review Tomorrowland reaches too far in too many directions - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Tomorrowland reaches too far in too many directions Tomorrowland Review Disney / TNS Casey (Britt Robertson) in Disneys ""Tomorrowland."" Casey (Britt Robertson) in Disneys ""Tomorrowland."" (Disney / TNS) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Despite its fine moments the futuristic Tomorrowland overreaches in trying to do too many things at once The good news about ""Tomorrowland"" is that as directed and co-written by the gifted Brad Bird its the rare tentpole movie with a sense of adventure a big summer extravaganza thats eager to do things differently.Ambition however is not the same as execution and its also true sadly that as much as you wish it were otherwise ""Tomorrowland"" works in only fits and starts. Tentpoles are rarely guilty of overreaching but ""Tomorrowland"" has a tendency to feel out of control a film that is finally more ambitious than accomplished. Bird himself best known for writing and directing brilliant animation like ""The Incredibles"" and ""Ratatouille"" hinted at ""Tomorrowlands"" difficulties when he puckishly described it at a screening as ""a science fiction action adventure road movie fable kind of.""INDIE FOCUS Sign up for our weekly movies newsletter ""Tomorrowland"" attempts to be many movies in one simultaneously modern and old-fashioned action-filled and comic effects-heavy and emotional. Theres a high degree of difficulty involved in doing it all. Part of the problem may be that this tale which posits the existence of an actual Tomorrowland in another dimension and details the efforts of two intrepid folk played by George Clooney and ""The Longest Rides"" Britt Robertson to get there did not have the most organic of births. Tomorrowland director Brad Bird keeps looking for the bright side Steven Zeitchik At the beginning of ""Tomorrowland"" -- the new futurist extravaganza from Brad Bird and the only film in the known universe to feature a bathtub that becomes a rocket ship -- a young boy travels to the 1964 Worlds Fair in New York. He has ginned up a jet pack in his garage and despite its bugs... At the beginning of ""Tomorrowland"" -- the new futurist extravaganza from Brad Bird and the only film in the known universe to feature a bathtub that becomes a rocket ship -- a young boy travels to the 1964 Worlds Fair in New York. He has ginned up a jet pack in his garage and despite its bugs... (Steven Zeitchik) Rather it stemmed in part from Disneys corporate desire to do more with celebrated brands like the Tomorrowland area of Disneyland. Perhaps overcompensating the overly complicated ""Tomorrowland"" script by Bird and ""Lost"" co-creator Damon Lindelof from a story credited to them and Jeff Jensen has too much going on and takes too long to get around to its central action.Things start with an awkward framing device that introduces two seemingly mismatched folks bickering about a message about the future they want to send out to their fellow citizens of Earth.Frank Walker (Clooney) is a cranky gentleman of a certain age who does not have much hope for that future. Young Casey Newton (Robertson) however is optimistic about what is to come and wants their joint message to reflect that. Tomorrowland trailer No. 3 Watch the third trailer for ""Tomorrowland."" Watch the third trailer for ""Tomorrowland."" See more videos What these two can agree on is that back when Frank was a bright young boy (played by Thomas Robinson) who brings an invention of his own to New Yorks 1964 Worlds Fair the future was a much brighter affair.At the fair Frank meets David Nix (Hugh Laurie) a scientist who doesnt have much patience for him and Athena (Raffey Cassidy) a girl his own age who takes a liking to him.Athena gives Frank a bright and shiny Tomorrowland pin that takes him to that actual land a happy place (shot in part in the City of Arts amp; Sciences in Valencia Spain) where technology is busy 24-7 solving everyones problems.At the same time as young Franks story is unfolding ""Tomorrowland"" introduces us to the energetic optimistic Casey Newton (played by Robertson whose buoyant energy is one of the films pluses) a young woman who does not believe in negative thinking.Worried that her engineer dad (Tim McGraw) will be out of a job should officials shut down the space facility at Cape Canaveral Fla. where he works Casey devotes her nights to brainy high-tech attempts to subvert the governments planned closure.That activity catches the eye of Athena (yes that Athena) who arranges for one of those Tomorrowland pins to fall into Caseys hands because she believes Casey is a special person who can save the future from itself.In one of the films most magical effects when Casey touches the pin she is immediately transported to gorgeous wheat fields (shot in Alberta Canada) just outside Tomorrowlands glistening spires.Because Tomorrowland feels like the happiest place on Earth (sound familiar?) filled with bright creative people doing their best work Casey wants to get back there as often as possible. But there wouldnt be any movie at all if that were an easy task.First for a variety of cumbersome reasons she has to track down the adult Frank Walker. Then they both have to contend with some sinister goings-on including pitched battles with robotic hitmen in black suits and sunglasses that seem to come from another movie.Even saying that doesnt do justice to the exhausting convolutions of ""Tomorrowlands"" plot or the confusing nature of its ending all of which undermine the films effective moments. While its good to see a summer movie that wants to do things differently as well as one that is resolutely and uncharacteristically optimistic about humanitys future what ""Tomorrowland"" does most urgently is make us hope that Bird finds his way back to animation some time soon.kenneth.turanlatimes.com------------TomorrowlandMPAA rating PG for sequences of sci-fi action violence and peril thematic elements and language.Running time 1 hour 47 minutes.Playing In general release------------INDIE FOCUS Sign up for our weekly movies newsletter Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Reviews Entertainment Tomorrowland Literature Brad Bird PG Rated Movies Tomorrowlands Britt Robertson frankly doesnt believe the hype D23 Brad Bird Damon Lindelof explore the secrets of Tomorrowland Tomorrowland director Brad Bird keeps looking for the bright side Tomorrowland is no utopia reviews say Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-tomorrowland-review-20150522-column.html#navtype=outfit,200,tomorrowland19,tomorrowland,latimes

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 345pm on Thursday May. 21 2015 Thursday May. 21 2015 Thursday May. 21 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Coming on the heels of the brutally dystopian vision of whats to come glimpsed in Mad Max Fury Road the jet packs and Jetsons gleam of the charming if preachy Tomorrowland comes as a huge sigh of relief. Now this is what we were promised a worlds fair cornucopia of rocket ships that take you high into the heavens and mid-century modern futurism run riot.In fact Tomorrowland starts as a reminiscence from inventor Frank Walker (George Clooney) about his visit to the 1964 Worlds Fair in New York where his much younger self (Thomas Robinson) has taken his homemade jetpack. But as it doesnt really work Frank is shown the door by one of the scientists Nix (Hugh Laurie).Yet theres a strange wide-eyed girl named Athena (Raffey Cassidy) in the room who senses something about Frank and slips him a pin with the letter ""T"" on it. Now its not just any pin but one that allows the holder to actually visit that glorious future that the fair was envisioning.Cut to the present and budding 20-something scientist Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) whose dad Eddie (Tim McGraw) is a soon-to-be-unemployed NASA engineer also finds the mysterious pin among her belongings. When she touches it -- bam -- shes decades ahead.Turns out the place is a secret alternative universe created by four great thinkers -- Thomas Edison Jules Verne Nicholas Tesla and Gustave Eiffel -- who were supposedly part of a hush-hush group called Plus Ultra an organization of scientists who wanted to design a future full of technological wonder and free from ignorance and want.But there are forces that dont want that visionary world to come to pass and its up to Frank and Casey to save the day.As envisioned by director Brad Bird (The Iron Giant Ratatouille The Incredibles) working from a script co-written by Damon Lindelof (Lost Star Trek Into Darkness The Leftovers) Tomorrowland is a feast of visual eye candy (added plus its not in 3D) and its bright optimism is a bracing tonic against the gloom and gray so often conjured up in movies about the future.Clooney and Robertson (Under the Dome The Longest Ride) work well together showing off some comedic mentor-mentee chemistry while McGraw in his first film since Country Strong five years ago shows he just might have a career that doesnt involve wearing a cowboy hat.Yet there are shifts in tone that are a bit jarring -- though much of the violence turns out to be robot on robot it might still be too much for some of the youngest viewers. At more than two hours it feels long and again for very young kids it might be a chore.Worse Tomorrowland ultimately dispenses with subtlety altogether and clubs viewers over the head with its Its a Small World After All message (yes this is a Disney film).Still theres much to admire in Tomorrowland. In a summer where science fiction is full of fear and dread -- in addition to Mad Max there will be Terminator Genesys and Jurassic World -- Tomorrowland offers something just a little different hope and promise.

"Tomorrowlands bright future includes George Clooney review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesTomorrowlands bright future includes George Clooney review Family film Tomorrowland relies on optimism a plucky heroine and George Clooney to save the future in Brad Birds ambitious and gorgeous fantasy.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. May 21 2015TomorrowlandStarring George Clooney Britt Robertson Raffey Cassidy and Hugh Laurie. Directed by Brad Bird. 130 minutes. Opening Friday at major theatres. PGDirector Brad Bird presents a gorgeously wrought hopeful future vision in Tomorrowland infusing the family film with enough entertaining action and retro-themed whiz bang to forgive an awkward opening and third-act weakness.Written by Bird and Losts Damon Lindelof Tomorrowland is barely based on Uncle Walts theme park area opening instead at the 1964 Worlds Fair. Earnest kid inventor Frank Walker (Thomas Robinson soon to grow into George Clooney) has overcome several bruising setbacks to arrive with his latest breakthrough a jet pack cribbed together from vacuum cleaner parts.Article Continued BelowFrank hopes it will net a prize but scientist-juror David Nix (Hugh Laurie) dismisses him. Frank ends up with something considerably more valuable including an adventure and friendship with mysterious young English girl Athena played with otherworldly charm by newcomer Raffey Cassidy.Britt Robertson plays the eternally optimistic Casey in Tomorrowland.Fast forward to present day and teen Casey Newton (Britt Robertson). Brainy and confident she can barely entertain any outcome other than positive. If something is in peril say her dads NASA engineering job shes going to go out and try to fix it even if it lands her in hot water.Caseys discovery of a T-logo pin unleashes the first of a daisy chain of fantasy scenes delightful to look at and craftily engineered by Bird (The Incredibles Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol) to deliver thrills with a touch of old-school Disney whimsy.Touching the pin instantly transports Casey to a futuristic somewhere a glorious trick that repeats in quick snatches before plopping her into a wheat field with a city rising in the distance Birds Wizard of Oz-like intention made clear.Its a gleaming metropolis the skies filled with flying trains zooming among transparent forest-filled tubes and divers effortlessly plunging between floating discs of water. But the visit has a time limit and its understandable why Casey is heartbroken to leave and desperate to return. Alas her pin has conked out. More on thestar.com Five questions with Tomorrowlands Matthew MacCaullTomorrowlands Britt Robertson changed by playing plucky teen in fantasyTomorrowland the latest movie to be based on Disney attractionHer search for a replacement sends Casey to Houston and a retro toy shop run by an oddball couple (Kathryn Hahn and Keegan-Michael Key). A visual feast for nerds its jammed with a cornucopia of pop culture goodies and cool oddities (and a few Star Wars items the force is strong in this newly Disney-run franchise) that will have audiences engaging in I Spy.With the help of a new sidekick Casey goes looking for Frank for a ticket back to Tomorrowland. She finds him his ramshackle house masking a high-tech fortress packed with Rube Goldberg gadgets and booby traps. Clooney seems delighted to play the curmudgeonly recluse who possesses a far less blue-sky take on the future than the earnest Casey.Turns out Casey fit the bill for optimistic futurist and her pin was her entry to the invitation-only Tomorrowland a place designed for the most creative risk takers scientists big thinkers and dreamers. And it was all a con. ""What you saw is gone"" says Frank something Casey interprets more as a challenge than fact.Getting back there takes nerve and a lot of help from a steampunk rocket ship hidden in the Eiffel Tower. But if its going to take an idealist to save the world Casey is the one for the job. Robertson is ideal as the exuberant curious teen and she and Clooney work well together onscreen. But its Cassidy who truly shines as the ageless Athena despite inhabiting a strange storyline that doesnt quite click in the final going.The same can be said for the confusing climactic showdown which combines weird science and a preachy lecture on what Earths selfish residents have done to the planet. Its a letdown not even a Tomorrowland-grade optimist could put a positive spin upon.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Photo Credit AP / Kimberley French advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT An optimistic teen and a pessimistic genius travel to a hidden utopia. Rated PG. BOTTOM LINE A whiz-bang spectacle with little substance but an appealingly positive message. CAST George Clooney Britt Robertson Raffey Cassidy Hugh Laurie LENGTH 210 ""Tomorrowland"" Walt Disney Pictures love letter to the sparkling utopias it helped create begins at the 1964 Worlds Fair in Queens. Young inventor Frank Walker played by Thomas Robinson arrives hoping to present his latest gizmo -- a jet-pack fashioned from Electrolux parts. It zooms whizzes and bangs but Frank has to admit ""It doesnt technically fly."" Thats a good description of this movie which is full of potential but never quite soars. Named for the streamlined tail-finned Disney park that opened in 1955 ""Tomorrowland"" takes us to a futuristic magic kingdom that has the power to save Earth from self-destruction. Its an appealing twist on nostalgia in which the quaint optimism of postwar America just might be the answer to our present-day pessimism. The problem is that much of ""Tomorrowland"" from its Marvel-style action to its ""Men in Black"" humor feels so yesterday. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Written by Damon Lindelof (TVs ""Lost"") and director Brad Bird (""The Iron Giant"") ""Tomorrowland"" is rich with Disney history Franks portal to Tomorrowland is the Its a Small World ride which Disney re-created for the Worlds Fair. Flash-forward to today and Frank (George Clooney) is an embittered recluse. He was exiled from Tomorrowland by Governor Nix (a droll Hugh Laurie) for inventing a device that pinpoints the exact date of Earths doom. And thanks largely to climate change its imminent. Britt Robertson (CBS ""Under the Dome"") feels miscast as Casey the present-day teen who discovers a magical Tomorrowland pin (the films simplest but coolest-looking prop) and must rouse Frank from his pity party. Casey seems a bit spluttery for someone said to possess a sky-high IQ and her can-do spirit feels more saccharine than stirring. The films best performance comes from 12-year-old Raffey Cassidy as Athena Franks curiously ageless boyhood crush. In a role that requires both grown-up gravitas and girlish charm Cassidy hits every note perfectly. In a way Birds ""Tomorrowland"" is the inspirational call to arms that Christopher Nolans ""Interstellar"" wanted to be. Nolan got bogged down in scientific theory; Bird cant even explain where Tomorrowland is exactly. Still ""Tomorrowland"" delivers a loud and clear message of hope for humanity which is a welcome thing to hear at any point in time. 030 MoviesTomorrowland trailer advertisement | advertise on newsday ----- LOOKING BACK ON TOMORROW Tomorrow isnt just another day.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Stephanie Merry May 21 2015 Follow stephmerry In the alternate dimension of ""Tomorrowland"" people swoop through the sky with jetpacks and parents push babies in hovering strollers. Swimming pools are uncontained blocks of water suspended in the air -- a whole group of them one above another so that swimmers can dive into one then pop out the bottom and somersault into the next. Whats the purpose of such an invention? Who knows? But it looks dazzling. Its almost enough to distract from the shapeless story surrounding all the very special effects. ""Tomorrowland"" is based on a Disney theme park area and despite that inauspicious source material the family-friendly movie has seemed poised to be one of the most exciting entries in the blockbuster season. For starters it isnt a sequel. Trailers havent revealed much besides brilliant images and vague but rousing narration from George Clooney. But the director at the helm Brad Bird brought us ""The Incredibles"" and ""Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol"" and ""Lost"" writer Damon Lindelof helped with the script. [The 2015 Summer Movie Guide] So its regrettable to report that the action adventure is a letdown. The story follows two modern-day scientific geniuses on a quest to get to the vibrant metropolis of Tomorrowland a secret world filled with big thinkers and grand ideas. But before they can go they need to tell the audience their back stories in great detail. Clooney plays Frank Walker who we see in flashback was introduced to that alternate dimension as a kid at the 1964 Worlds Fair. There he met a girl named Athena (Raffey Cassidy) who gave him a pin that transported him to Tomorrowland. The other genius is a high schooler named Casey (Britt Robertson) -- essentially Pollyanna on a motorcycle. In all of her classes from English to history to science she hears nothing but doomsday reports. The ice caps are melting war is breaking out everywhere and our world is basically a dystopian novel. So she raises her hand to ask How can we can we fix it all? Anything is possible she reminds us again and again. And again. And again. Athena still a little girl after all these years turns up to bestow a pin on Casey which also whisks her away but only for a few minutes -- just enough to give her a taste for more. And thats why she tracks down Frank. She wants him to take her there for a longer stay. Clooney is both amusing and touching in this role. He calls Casey ""kid"" speaking the parlance of movie curmudgeons everywhere and he resists her optimism for as long as he can. Hes just another apocalypse-obsessed conspiracy theorist -- albeit an uncharacteristically foxy one -- with a dozen locks on his front door. But Casey reminds him of the childlike earnestness he used to have and nostalgia is a powerful thing. Cassidy is also a commanding presence. With her clear penetrating eyes she occupies the precocious kid role without being overbearingly twee Sure she says cute things but shes also a tiny assassin. The characters are all quite vivid even if they sometimes speak in motivational poster quotes. So much of the movie consists of the back story that revealing much more feels wrong. Just know that the action ramps up once we reach the present day. Bad guys materialize (though its never entirely clear why) including a hilarious robot played by Matthew MacCaull whose bright mechanical smile makes him look like a life-size Ken doll. The camerawork and editing are impressive especially in scenes when Casey toggles between Earth and Tomorrowland with the touch of her magical pin. Once she arrives in the futuristic city the camera swoops and circles around her adding to the sense of wonder. And a scene much like a high-tech version of the ""Home Alone"" finale is also thrilling to watch despite taking place entirely within Franks cramped hideout. The most problematic part of the movie is the way it keeps the story hidden from the audience. Why do we need to get to Tomorrowland? Its a mystery And we dont fully understand the great importance of the journey until the last chapter of the movie at which point a minor character suddenly becomes a villain. The narrative is messy and meandering putting more emphasis on emotional payoffs than driving the plot forward. (It also leads to a somewhat problematic minor thread as Frank acts like a man scorned whenever Athena is around.) Maybe the ultimate goal of ""Tomorrowland"" remains obscure because once you know where the story is headed you realize its a familiar tale. The movie can conjure up futuristic images but the story is nothing we havent seen before. PG. At area theaters. Contains sequences of sci-fi action violence and language. 130 minutes. PG.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint A well-oiled machine of visuals and yet a wobbling rattletrap of storytelling the sci-fi fantasy ""Tomorrowland"" is an unwieldy clunker driven into the ditch at full speed. Injured in the accident were George Clooney as a boy inventor turned adult cynic Britt Robertson as a spunky teen optimist Hugh Laurie as a generic villain and many viewers. Like ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" ""Tomorrowland"" is a Walt Disney Pictures promotional tie-in to an exhibit at its resorts. There the similarity ends. The ""Pirates"" saga did delightful spoofy world-building around its yo-ho-ho theme. ""Tomorrowland"" for all its pictorial gloss goes back to the future badly. It imagines an era ahead when scientists have invented progressive exciting technologies for Earths salvation. Or have they? The few able to venture from the present into this world soon learn that promised things are seldom as good as they seem much like the trailer for ""Tomorrowland."" Framed as a time-traveling adventure it is a mystery film keeping the audience as ill-informed as the characters. It races torpedo-style from scene to set piece regardless of whether they advance the convoluted story wobble astray or even make sense. Rarely do we see a Disney family film where ray guns repeatedly zap humans to ashes the heroine is a repeat car thief the bad guy has his legs painfully crushed for a minute before his skull is crushed and the main man is madly romantic for a girl who could pass for his granddaughter. Even worse the incoherent ideas are unconnected. Its as if screenwriter Damon Lindelof (who scripted those dreadful houses of cards ""Cowboys and Aliens"" ""Prometheus"" and TVs ""Lost"") is trying to hit the young target audience with a Gatling gun. Confusion begins at the starting gate with Clooney scowling as the cantankerous on-screen narrator. He is Frank Walker a grumpy home-brew scientist arguing with an unseen female speaker about how to tell their enigmatic story. Even before it begins we are lost in Wonderland. How did the mismatched pair team up? Whom are they addressing and how and why? These questions and many more the overlong film answers only after much audience watch-gazing. Tomorrowland  out of 4 stars Rating PG for sci-fi action violence and peril thematic elements and language. In cranky commentary reappearing through the film Frank warns that we are approaching a chaotic future unlike the cheerful era of his youth when mankinds prospects seemed far out. Veering back to yesteryear we see Frank (played in childhood by Thomas Robinson) design a homemade jet pack that sends him tumbling across the Great Plains. Its the kind of big fun action sequence that director Brad Bird (""The Incredibles"" ""Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol"") handles well. He knows how to deliver big-budget spectacle. Does it advance the story? No. Aiming his flight pack high Frank wildly misses the mark much like the film. Franks character disappears into a decades-long sulk and we shift to a parallel plot line. Millennial idealist Casey Newton (Robertson) is a troublemaker to the high school teachers and police opposing her independent-minded schemes. Plucky but rarely law-abiding she tackles the worlds problems with sheer willpower her motorbike and robot drones. She and Frank team up when five minutes into her first visit hostile androids raid his house. Leaping into his rocket-powered escape bathtub they zoom toward Earths destiny like Dorothy and the Wizard ballooning to Oz. Clooney gives his insufferable role a dash of rich ham flavor adding the correct tone of amusing excess to each gripe. Robertson lends her miscreant character a degree of nerve and curiosity implying that shes smarter than the script illustrates. Hugh Laurie makes the antagonist a patronizing jerk just like the one he played in ""House"" while Raffey Cassidy gives her vigilant preadolescent a nice balance of girlish emotion and kung fu acrobatics. In a blink-and-you-miss-it scene as a sci-fi shops geeky owner Keegan-Michael Key -- in a zany wig and muffin-top fat suit -- climbs to the top rank of walk-on comedy players. If only the right cast could improve bad writing through performance alone. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

(Film Frame/Disney via AP) Film Frame Britt Robertson as Casey in a scene from Disneys ""Tomorrowland."" (Film Frame/Disney via AP) Disneys gimmick of naming movies for its theme-park attractions crashes and burns in ""Tomorrowland"" a here-and-now caper that will confuse children bore adults and offend anyone whos ever taken a science class.On paper Tomorrowland is the quadrant of Disneyland that is devoted to new technologies; in practice its just another zone of thrill rides. In fashioning a story to fit the title director and co-writer Brad Bird emphasizes roller-coaster commotion at the expense of wonder and imagination.The story begins in 1964 when young Frank Walker drags his homemade jet pack to the Inventions pavilion at the Worlds Fair in New York. The fair was a watershed in engineering and design but Bird only flits there long enough for Frank to meet Athena (Raffey Cassidy) a smartypants girl who provides him a portal to the future. Yet instead of letting us see the future through the wide eyes of a child Bird batters Frank and his misbehaving jet pack against every available surface like an unwanted Buzz Lightyear doll. It would take a space-age calculator to tally all the bumps bruises and broken bones that the characters in this movie endure for our supposed amusement. In modern-day Cape Canaveral Fla. teen astronomy buff Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) acquires a key to Tomorrowland -- a mysterious lapel pin -- but she can only visit the streamlined future for brief jolts before the key loses its power.Determined to return to this rather dull paradise of monorails and unisex jumpsuits she simply ditches her father NASA engineer Eddie (Tim McGraw) to visit the nations foremost experts in magical lapel pins. Hot on her trail are robots with ray-guns -- as well as the ageless Athena who leads Casey to the now-grizzled Frank (George Clooney). Frank is a grouchy hermit in upstate New York convinced by his research that the human race is doomed. But Casey insists that he take her to Tomorrowland and with the Men in Black blasting through his walls Frank takes Casey and Athena on a bone-rattling rocket-ship ride to the decrepit future. Thats where they try to convince cosmic overlord Nix (Hugh Laurie) that humanity is worth saving. Not even a baby Einstein could follow this nonsensical plot and even if your kids stay awake the payoff is paltry. The movie spends a total of about 10 minutes in an idyllic vision of the future; the other two hours are a regurgitation of ""Flubber"" with a dystopian twist.You can bet your bottom dollar that ""Tomorrowland"" will soon be yesterdays news.What ""Tomorrowland""  One and a half stars out of four  Rating PG  Run time 210  Content Sequences of sci-fi action violence and peril thematic elements and mild language Joe Williams  314-340-8344Film criticjoethecritic on Twitterjoewilliamspost-dispatch.com Tags George Clooney Britt Robertson Tim Mcgraw Hugh Laurie Tomorrowland Brad Bird Disneyland Joe Williams Joe Williams Joe Williams is the film critic for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

VPCBrad Birds film never quite reaches the heights he aims for but he has a great time trying to get there.Casey (Britt Robertson) in ""Tomorrowland.""(Photo Disney)Story HighlightsCritics rating 3.5 stars (out of 5)Director Brad Bird who co-wrote the film certainly knows his way around a futuristic chase scene.For all the visual splendor the message is heavy handed.Brad Bird hasnt given up.That will make more sense after you have seen ""Tomorrowland"" the film Bird (""Ratatouille"" ""The Incredibles"") has co-written and directed. For now lets just say this Optimism in his hands isnt just a pleasant characteristic. It might just save the world.Thats a lot to ask from anything much less a Disney movie loosely based on a theme-park attraction. Of course having George Clooney on hand helps. But even with him the story eventually gets bogged down in surprisingly heavy-handed message delivery. (On the other hand when Hugh Laurie is delivering the message at least it sounds great.)That said the film is ambitious challenging the audience to keep up. Thats a plus mostly. Remember heavy mental lifting for a summer blockbuster typically means trying to remember how many ""Transformers"" movies Megan Fox was in. On the other hand at times ""Tomorrowland"" is also just plain confusing.More Movie reviews and featuresThis is truly one of those films where the less you know going in the better. At times you may wonder just how much you actually know on the way out but thats a different consideration.The film begins with Frank Walker (Clooney) and Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) arguing over how to tell their story about the potentially grave future that lies ahead of us. Frank wants to go dark while Casey stresses optimism. That theme will run throughout the film.Pierce Gagnon (left) and George Clooney in the movie poster for ""Tomorrowland."" (Photo Disney)In flashbacks we meet the young Frank (Thomas Robinson) a junior inventor with a would-be jet pack trying to win a prize for his creation at the 1964 Worlds Fair. Hes blown off by a snooty judge named Nix (Laurie) but Nixs daughter Athena (Raffey Cassidy) takes a shine to the boy and invites him along on a genuinely magical journey to Tomorrowland where the jet packs work for real (as does Franks after a robots assist). Its a glimpse of the future -- before it all went to hell as the adult Frank warns so we know were in for some complications.And how. In the present Casey the daughter of a NASA engineer (Tim McGraw the country singer) gets arrested trying to prevent the demolition of a launch site. Upon release she finds a Tomorrowland souvenir button in her belongings. When she touches it she is instantly transported into a golden field of wheat just outside an Oz-looking city -- Tomorrowland. Visually its a stunning effect because when she lets go of the button she is back where she started. (She also runs into a lot of walls trying to reach the city.)AZCENTRALTomorrowland (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsThe button leads to a visit from none other than Athena still a girl who leads Casey to the grown-up Frank now a curmudgeonly recluse living in a broken-down house stocked with more than the usual amount of super-high-tech equipment. What follows involves some nifty escapes and action-movie heroics a tonal shift that is not always successful in a narrative sense but never less than thrilling visually. Bird really knows how to stage his futuristic chases and fights.""Youre special"" everyone tells Casey at various points and like most people who are she gets sick of hearing it. But so too is Frank which gives them a bond that wears even his icy defenses down. Interestingly while the movie certainly ends on an optimistic note -- one that is either moving or cloying depending on the mood youre in -- it doesnt guarantee Frank and Caseys success. That depends on us were told in not-so-subtle fashion.As with many movies that spend a long time getting somewhere once you reach the destination you realize it wasnt as satisfying as the trip. But that doesnt mean its not fun getting there. ""Tomorrowland"" may not fully reach the heights for which it strives but it has a good time trying.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Its so smart so winsome so utterly rejuvenating that youll have to wait until your eyes have dried and your buzz has worn off before you can begin to argue with it. And you should argue with it -- even if you had a blast as I did and want to see it again with the kids as I do -- because its a major pop-culture statement with all sorts of implications both vital and nutty. Related Stories George Clooney Brad Bird and Damon Lindelof on Tomorrowland Twitter and Dealing With the Haters Tomorrowlandas New Trailer Wait This Movie Was a Kick-ass Thriller This Whole Time? As he has demonstrated in The Iron Giant The Incredibles Ratatouille and Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol Bird can tell stories with the lightheartedness of a child and the cunning of a master craftsman His tightly plotted movies feel as if he were making them up as he went along. To reveal too much of Tomorrowlands zigzag narrative would be criminal -- the fun comes from being constantly disoriented -- but the first few scenes can be safely recounted. After a perplexing vaguely futuristic prologue in which George Clooney as Frank Walker addresses an offscreen audience while being corrected/heckled by an offscreen girl Bird flashes back to the New York Worlds Fair of 1964 where Franks nerdy younger self (Thomas Robinson) presents his ingenious but failed stab at designing a jet pack to a Brit scientist (Hugh Laurie) who belittles him. A little British girl with a darling overbite who calls herself Athena (Raffey Cassidy) and appears to be the scientists daughter hands Frank a Worlds Fair pin that transports him ... somewhere incredible Then theres another flashback closer to the present day. Florida teen Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) decides to sabotage a site in which NASA rockets are dismantled casualties of a country that has abandoned its dream of space flight. Jailed for her passionate vandalism Casey discovers among her belongings a 64 Worlds Fair pin that every time she touches it transports her ... somewhere incredible For all the mystery its obvious at once why both Casey and Frank qualify for that pin They have unfettered imaginations that authority figures keep trying to fetter. They are meant for higher things. A sign with a quote from Albert Einstein spells out Birds manifesto IMAGINATION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN KNOWLEDGE. He and composer Michael Giacchino lovingly conjure up the kid-movie era of high-school science fairs and friendly giant robots before HAL before the Terminator before Stephen Hawking and Bill Gates (among others) predicted AIs will one day be the end of us. Tomorrowland whisks us back to when kids could (or at least thought they could) make rockets in their suburban garages out of old vacuum-cleaner parts when a ""city of the future"" with the antiseptic bonhomie of Disney World could inspire awe instead of bad laughs and a desire to write WALT IS A PENIS on the side of a too-clean wall. In Caseys era by contrast high-school teachers drone on about climate catastrophe and gaze on her with contempt when she interrupts to ask ""Can we fix it?"" In Todayland positivity makes you radioactive. It emerges that Bird in Tomorrowland is mounting nothing less than a full-throated assault on the nihilism dystopianism and what might be called the fetishization of apocalypse in todays movies TV shows and books -- especially YA books that worm their way into the fantasies of impressionable kids. This is not you understand the movies subtext. Its the Uber-Uber-text. Its the message thats articulated in multiple ways as boldly as that Einstein sign by characters bad and good and its implicit in the riddle posed by Caseys NASA dad that becomes the cornerstone of his daughters worldview You have two wolves one representing darkness and despair the other light and hope. Which one lives? Says Casey ""The one you feed."" My response to Birds anti-dystopianism is ""Cool."" Because really how many more plague-flood-road warrior-kids-killing-kids movies do we need? It is time to feed that other wolf if only for the sake of variety. And maybe weve learned too well since the days of Dr. Strangelove -- which came out the same year as the New York Worlds Fair -- to ""stop worrying and love the bomb."" The trouble comes when Bird gets carried away with his critique of all things critical. In Tomorrowland he suggests that its the people sounding the alarm -- the ones constantly reminding us about climate change or the dangers of nuclear power -- who are accelerating our demise their pessimism wreaking havoc on imaginations that would otherwise be busy inventing solutions. I suspect thats Birds Ayn Rand side showing its warty head spinning another tale of extraordinary individuals kept from manifesting their creativity by repressive liberal groupthink. If Bird really believes we should shift the blame from a fossil-fuel industry bankrolling anti-science propaganda embraced by greedheads and fundamentalist wackjobs to the 98 percent of the worlds scientists saying ""If we dont act now and we mean now were royally screwed"" hes living in his own private Disneyland. Did I mention how delightful the movie is apart from that Mrs. Lincoln? It moves lightly from scene to scene its follow-the-bouncing-ball ease a reminder that Bird has always straddled two worlds his animation grounded by love of classic cinema his live-action films liberated by an animators sense of possibilities. As a bitter exile from the world of his dreams Clooney mugs more than he acts but his comic timing remains superb and he plainly adores his young female co-stars who are plainly adorable. Robertson is goosey and high-strung her reactive style pairing beautifully with Cassidys crisp poised underplaying as the enigmatic Athena. A Brit who looks like a young freckled Felicity Jones Cassidy is the movies breakout star and wouldnt it be a grim irony if she ends up starring in the next dystopian YA ""franchise""? What else does Hollywood do with kids these days besides pulp them? This article appears in the May 18 2015 issue of New York Magazine.

Thomas Robinson is a young Frank Walker in Disneys ""Tomorrowland"" an engaging film after a slow start. Photo Associated Press Tomorrowland -- a slow start but the future is bright 1 / 5 Back to Gallery ""Tomorrowland"" deals in two futures the one people imagined in the early 1960s and the one people imagine today. In the 6os despite a Cold War that threatened to turn hot and blow up civilization people saw the future as a clean and gleaming place with flying cars and monorails moving at the speed of light. It was a vision captured in the cartoon series ""The Jetsons."" Today the future is generally portrayed as a postapocalyptic nightmare with limited resources little water and either no government or an all-pervasive controlling government that makes life a living hell. ""Tomorrowland"" is a plea on behalf of that earlier more optimistic vision as having value in itself the idea being that if people believe they are heading into broad sunlit uplands the chances are better that they will arrive there. And despite a first hour that sometimes seems as if the movie itself will never arrive anywhere hold on. The future is bright. Only about 10 percent of movies finish better than they start but ""Tomorrowland"" is in that category. After a likable teaser in which George Clooney and Britt Robertson are recording a message of some kind the movie adopts a storytelling strategy thats labored and unnecessarily mysterious. First we meet the Clooney character Frank as a little boy making a visit to the 1964 Worlds Fair in New York. Next thing were in modern-day Texas for a long section about Casey (Robertson) a spunky 18-year-old girl with a gift for science. For almost an hour of screen time viewers are never quite told what is going on and more to the point theyre not made to care much either way. To hold audience interest everything in the movie that looks like action is pumped to the skies which only makes the storytelling more slow and plodding. Yet even at this early stage the look feel and atmosphere of ""Tomorrowland"" are appealing and the glimpses we get of the place Tomorrowland -- a city outside time and space -- make us want to linger there. The city looks like a cross between the Jetsons Orbit City and modern-day Abu Dhabi only with things like levitating baby strollers and swimming pools that hang in the air. Flying traffic crisscrosses in every direction with no discernible pattern or organization but then thats probably what our world would look like to someone from 200 years ago. ""Tomorrowland"" doesnt completely hit its stride until its two main characters Frank and Casey meet. Hes a former boy genius and shes a current girl genius. The two clash and collaborate; the story comes into focus and suddenly the movie is a delight. You know those novels that make you slog through 50 slow pages and then everything is OK? ""Tomorrowland"" is like that only with movies you cant adjust your reading speed. Clooney is the linchpin playing Frank with an anger and disappointment bordering on despair. This is not Clooney cashing in on some action-movie payday so he can go back to his serious work. This is a real performance and to the films credit Clooneys investment is supported by the script. Frank knows things terrible things that no one else knows and its eating him up inside. As Tomorrowlands governor Hugh Laurie functions as Clooneys opposite number a cynic insulated from emotional pain because hes beyond caring. The script gives him the best lines particularly a speech about apocalyptic movies (that is other peoples apocalyptic movies) -- a smart analysis of the publics current fascination with doom. Robertson is irrepressible and makes a bright contrast to Clooneys bitterness and Raffey Cassidy holds her own as a preternaturally precocious little girl. The movies last hour is filled with several strong sequences exhilarating to watch and gorgeous to behold but these are best discovered in the moment. But the best -- involving Paris the Eiffel Tower and a rocket ship built in the late 19th century -- deserves special acknowledgment. In the end ""Tomorrowland"" is as much about Edisons and Eiffels vision of the future as it is about the Jetsons. The movie is saying something worth hearing about the place the future holds the concept and promise of it in human existence. Its an attempt to wrest that vision from the narrow fantasies of doom-peddling action filmmakers. Thats an attempt worth making. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

EntertainmentMovies Tomorrowland Exhilarating for kids exhausting for adults Originally published May 21 2015 at 1205 am Updated May 20 2015 at 653 pm A disillusioned scientist (George Clooney) and a teenager (Britt Robertson) join forces to restore optimism to the world in ""Tomorrowland."" (Kimberley French) A review of the summer blockbuster ""Tomorrowland"" which stars George Clooney as a disillusioned scientist who along with a teen gets embroiled in a time-travel adventure. Rating 2.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic ""Tomorrowland"" for better or worse feels a lot like a trip to Disneyland dazzling at first with its zippy sights and sounds but eventually overwhelming so much so that you find yourself yearning for a quiet bench a bit of space a moment of calm. Im speaking of course as a grown-up and mileage may vary for the kids toward which this movie is aimed My 10-year-old assistant critic enthusiastically proclaimed ""Tomorrowland"" to be ""a great movie"" and left the theater beaming; I in the grand grown-up critical tradition departed feeling as if Id been on a theme-park ride that went on too long and that a drink might well be in order. Though its made with great energy and inventiveness theres something ultimately muddy about ""Tomorrowland""; its as if director Brad Bird got so caught up in the sets and effects and whooshing editing that the story somehow slipped away. Essentially its a family-friendly sci-fi tale in which a bright teenage girl named Casey (Britt Robertson) is given a button through which she can travel in time. Joining forces with disillusioned scientist Frank (George Clooney; the characters also played in flashbacks as a child by Thomas Robinson) and a mysteriously intense little girl named Athena (Raffey Cassidy) she zooms off to Tomorrowland bent on restoring optimism to the world. Along the way are plenty of pratfalls (or perhaps ""pratcrashes"" would be more precise; after a while you start to worry about the casts spinal health) numerous shots of Robertson staring in wonderment and enough goofy sci-fi action to keep the kids in the theater leaning forward in their seats. The effects are state-of-the-art and the settings a back-to-the-future Wonderland. (Yes thats Vancouvers H.R. McMillan Space Centre formerly known as the Planetarium standing in nicely as a futuristic pavilion.) Movie Review 1/2   Tomorrowland with George Clooney Hugh Laurie Britt Robertson Raffey Cassidy Tim McGraw Kathryn Hahn Keegan-Michael Key Thomas Robinson. Directed by Brad Bird from a screenplay by Damon Lindelof and Bird. 124 minutes. Rated PG for sequences of sci-fi action violence and peril thematic elements and language. Several theaters. But Clooney despite some impressive movie-star stubble is given little chance to demonstrate his trademark charisma (he disappears from the film for nearly an hour) and all that whooshing around in time and space gets tiring by the movies final third. If you cant take your kid to Disneyland this weekend ""Tomorrowland"" makes a quite serviceable two-hour substitute; just schedule a little nap time afterward for both of you.

A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - In a junk-food summer Brad Birds Tomorrowland is a defiant carrot stick a blockbuster adventure flick where the message is ""Think smart."" Its a deliberate phooey to the kiddie carnage of movies such as Transformers and The Avengers which frighten children about the apocalypse before they can even spell the word -- a running joke in Tomorrowlands background is a fake movie poster flogging grim dreck called ToxiCosmos 3.Bird and co-writer Damon Lindelof have nearly offed the planet a few times themselves in Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol (nuclear missiles) World War Z (zombie contagion) and TVs The Leftovers (biblical rapture). But hey doom sells. And Tomorrowland wants us to question what were buying. Yesterdays doomsayers were bearded lunatics holding placards -- today we call them news anchors. Its hard to rally to fix the planet when weve been cowed into hopelessness by an insurmountable number of threats war drought ISIS famine global warming oil scarcity Ebola economic unrest. Have we become so numb to future destruction that our cynicism is allowing it to happen?Film DetailsCritics Pick Tomorrowland RatingPG GenreSciFi/Fantasy Running Time130 min. More Info Trailer This is complex stuff for a kids romp and Bird cant figure out how to get started. Tomorrowland opens with George Clooney playing pessimistic inventor Frank Walker addressing the audience. ""This is a story about the future and the future can be scary"" he cautions. From behind the camera a girl interrupts and asks him to be more upbeat. He cant and after minutes of their tiresome bickering our movie begins anew from her more positive point of view. She is revealed as high school science whiz Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) the daughter of a NASA engineer (country singer Tim McGraw) whose latest job is dismantling the shuttle launch platform -- the kind of irony designed to inspire children to crayon heartbroken letters to their congressman.Casey is a dreamer. Shes also one of the best female role models to hit screens this year a stubborn brainiac who races around in two hoodies and a baseball cap. (Shes got more important things to think about than boys or her hair though the latter considerately coils itself into glamorous loose curls.) However shes out-badassed in her own movie by the pint-sized Athena (Raffey Cassidy) an android ambassador who slips the human a pin that transplants Casey -- temporarily -- to a resort called Tomorrowland the technological refuge where Athena was forged. Athena is a freckled action hero molded to look like a 13-year-old girl and shes marvelously constructed impatient deceptive disobedient brave and brilliant (though as she stresses she cant invent ideas only execute them).

Sep. 13 600pm At the New York Worlds Fair in 1964 -- where Walt Disney debuted Its a Small World before transplanting the ride and its earworm theme song to Anaheim -- Athena gave young Frank (Thomas Robinson) the same pin and eventually as he claims destroyed his life. Today hes a crackpot hermit in a booby-trapped house counting down to Armageddon the probability of which hes calculated as 100 percent. Clooney cranks his charisma way down so theres no question of romance between him and Robertsons teen heroine. (In real life the 25-year-old actress isnt that much younger than some of his past girlfriends.) Hes more get-off-my-lawn grandpa than silver-fox charmer. For the first time we get a glimpse of the actor hes going to become a patrician whose new 7-year-old fans will grow up discover Oceans Eleven and be astonished that the old guy was once a total babe.But back to the movies vision of the future. Birds Tomorrowland is a literal oasis of ingenuity a shiny skyscraper metropolis surrounded by endless wheat fields as though science has figured out how to heal gluten intolerance. Its residents zoom around wearing jetpacks and protective airbag suits and when they slip those off everyone tends to wear bright yellow. This says Bird is the future we imagined in the past -- call it Aspirational Jetsons. (Its also the future Walt Disney fantasized when he built Disneyland Tomorrowland which today has devolved into a carpeted warren of dark rooms whose displays exist only to get kids to buy Fitbits and sunscreen.) If we strive for this dream instead of accepting the apocalypse is there still time to build it ourselves?The odd thing is I suspect an inspirational movie like Tomorrowland will turn off audiences who just want to see a time-waster that doesnt shame them for throwing recyclables in the trash. Thats a pity. Bird layers on plenty of dazzle such as a nifty shot where the Eiffel Tower splits in two revealing an antique spaceship that would make the Lumiere brothers swoon. But his heart is what keeps the story motoring and the ending is perfectly engineered including a coda that encourages all of us to try harder.Bird has made a film that every child should see. And if his 190 million dream flops hell be asking the same question as his movie When did it become uncool to care?TOMORROWLAND | Directed by Brad Bird | Written by Damon Lindelof and Brad Bird | Disney | Citywide Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

"Review Tomorrowland beautiful but preachy - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Tomorrowland beautiful but preachyBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News CorrespondentPosted 05/20/2015 095024 AM PDTUpdated 05/20/2015 044935 PM PDT The Walt Disney Co. deserves honors for inspiring invention and celebrating ingenuity qualities reflected within its theme parks and many of its most notable creations.So its only fitting that its latest family film ""Tomorrowland"" delivers a hopeful message to budding innovators and communities at large encouraging everyone particularly teenage girls to initiate positive mindful action to trigger needed global change.What a worthy theme to expound upon in such a world so full of dismay tethered to and entertained by doom and gloom prophecies.But noble intentions dont always net smashing results and such is the case with the disappointing ""Tomorrowland"" starring Britt Robertson and George Clooney. Its premise and mission arent the real problem. Thats the awkward often preachy screenplay written by Damon Lindelof and director Brad Bird. The overly long film revs its engine but never really blasts off even near the end. The story explores a magical land of the future and concocts an intriguing but not thoroughly realized story about reclusive and bitter inventor Frank Walker (Clooney) who needs to get his mojo back and the curious smart and upbeat teen Casey Newton (Robertson) who teaches him -- and us -- an invaluable lesson.""Tomorrowland"" starts off awkwardly with Clooney speaking directly to the camera detailing his characters boyhood and odyssey to Tomorrowland an alternative dimension where the brightest minds have been selected to freely create and innovate.Advertisement The narrative device is stilted and off-putting with Franks story being told and then Caseys following suit. We know those two will meet up eventually but it takes too long to happen.The best scenes come when a young Frank (played cutely by Thomas Robinson) takes his human jetpack invention to New Yorks 1964 Worlds Fair an attraction where Disney showcased some of its cutting-edge technology. There Frank meets Athena (Raffey Cassidy) a whip-smart girl who speaks with a crisp British accent and has special powers. The wise-beyond-her-years Athena sees a brilliant mind in young Frank. So does scientist Nix (Hugh Laurie) who seems a bit shady. Frank soon receives a button with a ""T"" on it and pursues Athena as she enters the Its a Small World attraction at the fair by hopping onto a boat which whisks him off to Tomorrowland. It is then when Bird director of ""The Incredibles"" and ""Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol"" excels giving us wide-eyed visual Disney marvels that make you feel like a kid again. A particularly magical scene involves cylinderlike swimming pools that let you plunge from one to another. But that e-ticket ride doesnt explore enough of the nooks and crannies of this awesome place and leaves the viewer begging for more. Thomas Robinson as young Frank Walker in Tomorrowland. (Disney) ( Disney ) Instead the narrative reins are handed over to Casey. Fortunately shes an engaging and intelligent heroine. And while its most welcome to see a teenage female character who is resourceful and determined to prove that the negative status quo is useless the manner in which her story is threaded in is clunky. Robertson (""The Longest Ride"") expresses a youthful vitality and hope that buoys the film. Thats especially evident in her scenes with Tim McGraw playing her NASA dad Ed.Clooney coasts on his charm at the start and redeems himself later in the final stretch even when the script gets preachy. Its too bad the screenplay didnt dedicate more time to the exchanges between Frank and Casey. Instead we get some chase scenes and a lot of expository dialogue.That said ""Tomorrowland"" does have some sparks including two off-the-wall and all-too-short appearances from Keegan-Michael Key (""Key amp; Peele"") and Kathryn Hahn (""This Is Where I Leave You"") as kooky memorabilia shopkeepers.And you simply cant deny the spectacular production design of Tomorrowland itself which is as appealing as the message at the films center. Too bad message takes precedence over storytelling.What looked so promising on paper and in the trailers winds up being just OK rather than great. Given the past efforts of everyone involved thats the biggest present-day shock of ""Tomorrowland.""

"Tomorrowland review Clooney imagineers hope - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Tomorrowland review Clooney imagineers hope Tomorrowland clip Clip from ""Tomorrowland."" (Screenplay) Clip from ""Tomorrowland."" (Screenplay) Christopher BorrelliContact Reporter Brad Bird and Tomorrowland are the kind of Disney we need right now By now you probably heard that the series finale of ""Mad Men"" ended with adman Don Draper dressed in loose-fitting whites chanting ""om"" on the lawn of a commune in California perched at the edge of the Pacific the 1960s having slid into the 1970s. Then just as we assumed Don had found spiritual release a smile flickered at his mouth. He had an idea and the show cut to that most characteristic of 70s corporate hosannas -- a field of people singing they would like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony they would like to buy the world a Coke. There was ambiguity in those final images but the message was plain Someone perhaps Don landed on a deliriously catchy and deeply cynical way to sell hope and optimism.But he didnt get there first. Another company man from Illinois a guy named Walt Disney arguably perfected the 20th centurys selling of utopia and though its hard to pick just one flicker of inspiration that best summarizes Disneys can-do philosophical insistence on a better cleaner future where all the PeopleMovers run on time Tomorrowland is a front-runner. Built for the Disneyland park in 1955 it was a gleaming vision of a future -- to be specific that far-off Valhalla of 1986 -- full of innovation and promise and so whatever its faults the new Brad Bird movie ""Tomorrowland"" is never less than on-message a buoyant old-school Disney-certified imagineering of hopefulness. In fact at times ""Tomorrowland"" plays like such a throwback to those sweetly naive low-rent live-action Disney matinees of the 60s and 70s George Clooney is like a Fred MacMurray with gravitas gruff and grizzle predictably warming up to a young dreamer (a terrific Britt Robertson) of cheer and vision.And yet -- aside from the films goofy last moments a hilariously odd misstep that appears to rework ""Its a Small World"" as a doomsday cult -- theres nothing cheap or particularly 21st century ironic about ""Tomorrowland."" The film is pointedly an argument against apathy a consistently beautiful vision that conjures a future better than the one we expect. Just as Disney himself could both market optimism and swallow it ""Tomorrowland"" ingeniously weaves the theme parks bottomless sense of invention with a plot about our loss of confidence in the future. It is in some ways a two-hour act of furious clapping for Tinker Bell to wake up -- or a kiddie adaptation of ""Interstellar"" an earnest reminder that America once innovated ... Rockets?I forget.Of course if youre on the films wavelength it is easy to take any criticism of ""Tomorrowland"" as corrosive naysaying and so let me just say I mostly admired ""Tomorrowland"" and think Brad Bird is the kind of Disney we need right now. As director of ""The Iron Giant"" ""The Incredibles"" and ""Ratatouille"" -- and even ""Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol"" a surprisingly delightful paradoxical sleeper of a blockbuster -- he has been one of those rare proponents of exceptionalism who doesnt curdle into Ayn-Rand-ish sourness. He often roots his imagery in a bright post WWII retro-future and so ""Tomorrowland"" begins with that most iconic of our retro-futures the 1964 Worlds Fair arguably the peak of Americas Kennedy-era optimism. George Clooney Britt Robertson Raffey Cassidy Film Frame AP George Clooney from left Britt Robertson and Raffey Cassidy star in director Brad Birds ""Tomorrowland."" George Clooney from left Britt Robertson and Raffey Cassidy star in director Brad Birds ""Tomorrowland."" (Film Frame AP) Clooneys character Frank Walker says disappointedly that when he was a kid ""the future was different"" and the film floats back to 64 A boy (Thomas Robinson playing a young Walker) brings a homemade Electrolux-hacked jet pack to a famous inventor (Hugh Laurie) whose preternaturally mature young daughter (played by Raffey Cassidy) takes a liking to young Frank. She slips him a pin emblazoned with a ""T."" Touch it a new world appears a Tomorrowland which we soon recognize as a sort of Oz. And just as Oz sat in the distance beyond the poppies Tomorrowland awaits beyond the waving golden fields of wheat where its always morning in America. But hold on No sooner are we in Tomorrowland gaping at full-realized wonders -- multilevel swimming pools PeopleMovers without rails -- were back to 2015 in muggy Florida meeting Casey (Robertson) daughter of a NASA engineer soon to be out of job. His problem is he lives in a United States that forgot it landed a man to the moon. And Casey likes space believes in pushing the frontiers of imagination. But in Florida shes alone. Until she receives one of those nifty pins and visits Tomorrowland which is so full of swooping highways darting UFO cars and crystal spires it had to be a zoning nightmare. Check out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune. But this is less of an argument for NASA and exploration and more of a couture tomorrow by Disney -- Space Mountain for one sits prominently on Tomorrowlands skyline too far in the distance for us to notice the puke on sidewalk out front. So I am doubly admiring of Bird because though his movie grows gradually mediocre -- you can almost see him behind the camera fighting off the summer-action urges -- he doesnt allow it to lapse into easy nostalgia for a future we once expected. His Tomorrowland is merely one vision of the future and maybe he provocatively suggests to be avoided. Utopias and dystopias are two sides of the same coin and soon enough ""Tomorrowland"" lapses into a paranoid thriller albeit one in which Walker banished from Tomorrowland still harbors its fun Dan Brown-like historical secrets.Those secrets make you lean forward a bit but the movie zooms past too quickly becoming a mash of good intentions a little too on the nose with its message of social responsibility and possibility to let its jet packets soar. Still his future is that familiar rust-colored downer were overly familiar with and the film is not quite preachy I just wish Bird would let his themes percolate as he did in ""Mission Impossible"" which was not really about anything but the joy of filmmaking. But that would have been enough here. Or as Walker himself blurts out at one point ""Do I have to explain everything? Cant you just be amazed and move on?""""Tomorrowland"" - 3 starsMPAA rating PG for for sequences of sci-fi action violence and peril thematic elements and languageRunning time 2 hours 10 minutesOpens Fridaycborrellitribune.comTwitter borrelli Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Tomorrowland Reviews Mad Men Cannes 2015 Disney/Pixars Inside Out a return to form Pitch Perfect writer Kay Cannons Chicago connection with Tina Fey Pitch Perfect 2 review Snide and lazy just dont cut it Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising77deg",http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-tomorrowland-movie-review-george-clooney-20150519-column.html#navtype=outfit,200,tomorrowland34,tomorrowland,chicagotribune

Tomorrowland the utopian metropolis of Disneys new tentpole fantasy is less a vision of the future than a peek into the past--the space age that only a mid-century society drunk on wonder and new advances in transportation could have envisioned. The anachronism is very much by design Positing that the only way to move forward may be to go back Tomorrowland aches for an era when people were still hopeful about where the world might be headed. Its nostalgic for a future that never happened.This is one strange contraption of a movie a 200 million exercise in corporate synergy thats also an earnest passion project for nearly everyone involved. The inspiration if thats the right word for talking about an amusement-park adaptation is one of several themed areas featured at various Mouse House entertainment destinations. (Disneyland makes an early cameo if only to remind kids in attendance that the real Tomorrowland is just a summer vacation away.) But the film feels equally animated by the fixations of its star George Clooney who seems to genuinely believe in the ability of Hollywood cinema to change the world and the obsessions of director Brad Bird offering another vaguely Randian ode to ""special people."" For a family film its both appropriately zippy and--here and there--oddly violent with robot faces mashed out of shape by baseball bats and hapless police officers reduced to piles of ash.Less a city of the future than a kind of alternate-dimension incubator--think Silicon Valley by way of the Worlds Fair--Tomorrowland is off limits to all but the biggest dreamers and most intrepid innovators who earn their invitations by thinking outside of the box. Who built this fantastical planned community and how long has it been yanking the worlds brightest minds from their humdrum existences? With Damon Lindelof (Lost Prometheus) sharing screenwriting duties with Bird its no huge shock that the details are either sketchy or convoluted. The place itself though is a sight to be seen. Our first sustained look occurs when conspicuously named teenage dissident Casey Newton (Britt Robertson possibly a hologram of pure optimism) comes into possession of a mysterious pin. Each touch replaces her surroundings (NASAs backyard Cape Canaveral) with images of the eponymous city. Appropriately this experience--conveyed in a single winding awestruck take--is not unlike a 3-D hyper-advanced version of one of those Universal Studios rides where a huge screen creates the sensation of moving through a fictional world.Investigating the origins of her magic device Casey gains a couple of uneasy companions Frank Walker a former boy genius and Tomorrowland recruit whos grown into a bitter middle-aged man (Clooney); and Athena (Raffey Cassidy) the precocious ageless robot girl who ushered him into the brain trust and then broke his heart. Overlong flashbacks featuring a lot of corny jet-pack humor set up this central relationship. Its somehow both oddly touching and a little creepy to see Clooney play jilted betrayed romantic against a little girl even if the character shes portraying is technically older (and much less human) than Frank.Building off of the retro futurism of The Iron Giant and The Incredibles--not to mention the tech wizardry of his fantastic Mission Impossible sequel--Bird keeps throwing new kinds of gee-whiz spectacles at the audience. One set piece involves a stealth function for the Eiffel Tower; another introduces a godlike answer to Google Earth allowing our heroes to scroll through both space and time with the roll of an oversized trackball. The best of these gimcrack effects sequences finds Casey and Frank fleeing a squadron of mechanical G-men in a booby-trapped house the enemies felled by various high-tech weapons and tools. Bird stages the PG mayhem with his usual grasp of dimension and space his gift for action thats timed like physical comedy. He keeps the whole thing moving even when it begins to feel bogged down by preachiness and sci-fi exposition.""I get things are bad"" someone says early into the movie. ""But what are we doing to fix it?"" Tomorrowland at its core is about the self-fulfilling prophecy of defeatism--the way that gloom and doom predictions about the future have relieved people of the responsibility of caring. (The villain who students of Eberts Law should have no trouble identifying delivers a pretty pointed monologue about apocalypse apathy.) Thats a nice message for a hyper-visible studio event movie to impart; sending viewers especially young ones out on a hopeful note is a noble goal even within the context of a cross-promotional blockbuster. But who exactly will be making these seismic societal changes? As in The Incredibles and Ratatouille Bird flirts heavily with exceptionalism again suggesting a hard line between superior citizens and mediocre masses. That makes Tomorrowlands call to action feel weirdly exclusionary as though saving the world were a job fit only for the chosen few--the renaissance men and women the brilliant elite the George Clooneys of all walks. The fight for the future like Tomorrowland is apparently by invitation only.

Hugh Laurie plays David Nix in ""Tomorrowland."" (Kimberley French) George Clooney plays Frank Walker in ""Tomorrowland."" Casey (Britt Robertson l.) and Athena (Raffey Cassidy) in ""Tomorrowland."" (Kimberley French) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday May 19 2015 622 PM Title TOMORROWLAND Film Info With George Clooney Britt Robertson A girl and an inventor travel to a utopian parallel universe. Director Brad Bird (210). PG. Area theaters. In 3D where available. Tween girl fans of summer adventures unite ""Tomorrowland"" is here for you. Thats good news even in a summer filled with female-centric flicks (""Mad Max Fury Road"" ""Pitch Perfect 2"" ""Inside Out"" ""Terminator Genisys""). The bummer news however is that this fantasy adventure lacks focus when it should be laser-sharp and stumbles when it could soar. Adults can drop off the kids and jet off for a bit. Its a convoluted plot In present-day Florida Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) is an industrious teenager living with her NASA engineer dad (Tim McGraw). Athena (Raffey Cassidy) an android who looks like a young girl secretly gives Casey a strange pin that when pressed reveals a glimpse of a futuristic city in another dimension. In a flashback to the Worlds Fair in 1964 Athena meets a boy inventor Frank Walker and recruits him to live in that same city Tomorrowland. Back in the present Athena introduces Casey to the grizzled fiftyish Frank (George Clooney) who is monitoring transmissions from Tomorrowland about when the world will end. Bad news Its soon. Frank Casey and Athena -- with evil robots in pursuit -- get to a rocket hidden inside the Eiffel Tower and blast into the other dimension to confront shifty Gov. Nix (Hugh Laurie) and save the Earth. ""Tomorrowland"" wears its big movie heart on its sleeve which is to its advantage. Its tone recalls a 70s Disney film (think ""Escape From Witch Mountain"" or ""The Island at the Top of the World""). The design is deliberately retro-cool and the refreshing old-fashioned approach is part of the films philosophy Ingenuity positive thinking and imagination are the best weapons to stop Armageddon -- which in this story is partly brought about by the wrong kind of wishful thinking. But director Brad Bird (""The Incredibles"") fails to anchor the film with any great action scenes and the movies worthwhile lessons are told not shown to us. Like J.J. Abrams ""Super 8"" (2011) this film wants to honor a past style but cant quite crack the code to what made it tick. Clooney though has a terrific rapport with his young costars -- really George you should think about being a dad -- and knows how to be simultaneously wry and hopeful. Hes a grown-up whos not a buzzkill. Robertson (""The Longest Ride"") is also adept at providing smart spunky can-do tude; and Cassidy a young English actress is entertaining as both android guide and action heroine. Both young performers provide the leap forward that will hopefully be the legacy of ""Tomorrowland"" blockbuster heroines who transcend the limits of their movies and their young fans hopes and dreams. jneumaiernydailynews.com Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" throughout the day Thurs. - Sun. on New Yorks WOR 710 AM and at wor710.com.

Photo Disney MOVIE REVIEW Tomorrowland Running time 130 minutes. Rated PG (violence frightening images). ""Must I explain everything to you?"" Frank a cranky reclusive scientist played by a miscast George Clooney tells an intruder when the star finally makes a proper appearance an hour into Disneys disappointing sci-fi epic ""Tomorrowland."" ""Cant you just be impressed and move on?"" the exasperated Frank asks. Sorry no. ""Mad Max Fury Road"" demonstrated precisely how to present an involving post-apocalyptic story with minimal explanation but even reams of preachy dialogue and graphics fail to pull together ""Tomorrowland"" as anything like a coherent moviegoing experience. Theres plenty of futuristic eye candy and director Brad Bird (of the Pixar masterpieces ""The Incredibles"" and ""Ratatouille"") and his co-screenwriter Damon Lindelof of TVs ""Lost have crafted some memorable sequences. But the film never adds up to the sum of its parts effectively a two-hour trailer for a movie Id still be interested in seeing. Britt Robertson in ""Tomorrowland.""Photo Disney Britt Robertson (""The Longest Ride"") has the main role -- Casey Newton a teenage brainiac (or so the script insists) whose dad (Tim McGraw) pulls strings to get her out of jail after shes caught trying to sabotage plans to demolish a NASA launchpad at Cape Canaveral. This somehow attracts the attention of Athena (Raffey Cassidy) a mysterious ostensible 12-year-old who weve already seen in a prologue luring young Frank into a futuristic world at the 1964 New York Worlds Fair -- by way of a trap door in Disneys ""Its a Small World"" ride. Britt Robertson in ""Tomorrowland.""Photo DIsney Athena gifts Casey a Tomorrowland pin that allows our heroine to enter this same world when she touches it -- at least until the battery runs out. Caseys hooked and makes a memorable visit to a memorabilia shop in Texas (run by Kathryn Hahn and Keegan-Michael Key) as part of her effort to return to Oz. Then Casey hits the road in a stolen car with Athena en route to the middle-aged Frank who wants nothing to do with either one of them -- at least until an army of killer robots (dont ask) shows up. There are some more delights along the way -- Franks booby-trapped house and an antique rocket launched from beneath the Eiffel Tower -- but the film goes into free-fall after it gets to Tomorrowland. Seemingly the only human occupant of this Shangri-La is ""Governor"" David Nix (Hugh Laurie) who comes off like the most reasonable of the major characters (though that doesnt seen to have been the intention). Hugh Laurie (center) in ""Tomorrowland.""Photo Disney But many unanswered questions are raised. The city is said to be the brainstorm of geniuses like Edison but theres no clue who exactly built and paid for it. If young Frank was raised by Nix as appears to be the case does adult Frank have daddy issues? And how exactly did Frank learn that his dreamgirl Athena who was effectively his stepsister is (very minor spoiler here) not human? And except for an offhand reference to climate change deniers this vaguely liberal Disney film is unwilling to assign any blame for a global apocalypse that ultimately leads to a mass evacuation vastly less convincing than the one in ""Interstellar.""

George Clooney complains at one point in ""Tomorrowland."" ""Cant you just be amazed and move on?"" Itd be a cute line if it didnt seem to be the directors whole approach to the movie. Really Ive got things exploding Ive got robots Ive got time-and-space travel and spooky men in black and plugs for Coca-Cola and Disney parks (As well as um a really creepy unintentional ""Lolita"" vibe.) And you want to bug me with questions about character and motivation and plot? Whats wrong with you people? You see - you see? - this is why we cant have nice things. Admitted ""Tomorrowland"" starts cute with two competing narrators. Grizzled grumpy George Clooney wants to tell us about something that happened to him as a child. Pert positive-thinking Britt Robertson (who looks distractingly like Jennifer Lawrence here) wants to tell us about something that happened to her just now. And the thing is its the same thing - a brief weird dimension-warping trip that took them to another world. The movie decides to stick with Robertsons narrative which is fine - except things get confusing fast and never quite pause to untwist themselves. More than an hour in I was still reeling. Who is Athena that weird ageless little girl who keeps popping up talking like Veronica Cartwright? Whats the deal with the villainous Hugh Laurie? And why are there murderous robots? Personally I liked the robots mostly because one of them had the slick hair and slicker smile of a possibly-even-more-synthetic Tom Cruise -- which I took as a quick in-joke about director Brad Birds last movie ""Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol."" But they dont serve much purpose here beyond providing chase scenes and graphic violence. (You see since theyre robots apparently you can fill the screen with their decaps amputations and brutally bashed-in faces and still get a kiddie-friendly PG. Now nice.) Apart from the scary My Very First Terminator vibe theres also a disquieting subplot which has the child actor playing Clooneys character falling for the child actress playing Athena. Except even though he ages into an adult performer and she doesnt he never falls out of love. Of course nothing happens - this is despite the violence a Disney film - but it gives Clooneys lonely bachelor hero a queasy Humbert Humbert subtext that cant quite be avoided as much as you try. Robertson is charming and there are a couple of wonderful setpieces - an old farmhouse that turns out to be stuffed full of high-tech booby traps a retro toystore crammed full of everything you ever wanted a bittersweet baby-boomer trip back to the 1964 Worlds Fair. But wheres the story? The characters? The lack of ideas is a particular disappointment because Birds cartoons always had them and they were pretty personal ones - like the 50s Americana that ran through the marvelous ""The Iron Giant"" or the pro-elitism defense that powered ""The Incredibles."" But strip ""Tomorrowland"" down to its essentials and you get an ending out of ""Id like to teach the world to sing"" and a moral which boils down to Just be positive OK? So OK. Im positive ""Tomorrowland"" was a disappointment. Ratings note The film contains constant if bloodless violence. Tomorrowland (PG) Disney (130 min.) Directed by Brad Bird.

Britt Robertson plays Casey Newton a plucky suburban teenager with an uncanny knack for solving scientific problems. When she learns of the existence of Tomorrowland - a parallel dimension where humanitys greatest scientists thinkers and artists have created a hermetically sealed perfect world - shell do anything to get there. Enter George Clooneys grumpy crumpled inventor Frank who has a dire warning for the real world and for the ailing Eden over the rainbow. Tomorrowland is singularly unafraid of weighty concepts tackling climate change our ongoing fascination with the apocalypse and the very Disney-ish idea of being special. It does get dry (some scenes feel suspiciously like TED talks) and the scripts fleeting efforts to unpick its dubious Ayn Rand-ish central ideology are completely undermined by a clunky flat-as-a-pancake finale. But when it puts down its copy of Political Philosophy for Dummies and focuses on character and action Tomorrowland is a blast. The Incredibles director Brad Bird could choreograph daring rocket escapes and soaring jet-pack flights with both eyes shut while George Clooney and Britt Robertson have a thoroughly convincing knockabout chemistry - though both play second fiddle to blank-eyed British youngster Raffey Cassidy as a mysterious dimensional exile. The production design too is glorious Tomorrowland itself with its Buck Rogers fashion and skyscraper-high swimming pools is a triumph of digital world-building. How all this will play with its target family audience is unclear - young uns may get a bit fidgety during the talky bits - but there are ideas aplenty rattling around here and some crackling action to tie it all together.

Nice idea but it didnt really work for me. The acting is not bad especially the kids but George Clooney and Hugh Laurie are both annoying and the story is a bit of a mess.

In his Pixar triumphs ""The Incredibles"" and ""Ratatouille"" writer-director Brad Bird proved himself not just a wizardly storyteller but also an ardent champion of excellence -- of intelligence creativity and nonconformity -- in every arena of human (and rodent) accomplishment. All the more disappointing then that the forces of mediocrity have largely prevailed over ""Tomorrowland"" a kid-skewing adventure saga that for all its initial narrative intrigue and visual splendor winds up feeling like a hollow hucksterish Trojan horse of a movie -- the shiny product of some smiling yet sinister dimension where save-the-world impulses and Disney mass-branding strategies collide. A sort of ""Interstellar Jr."" in which the fate of humanity hinges on our ability to nurture young hearts and minds the picture runs heavier on canned inspirationalism than on actual inspiration which wont necessarily keep it from drawing a hefty summer audience with its family-friendly elements topnotch production values Imax rollout endless tie-in potential and a top-billed George Clooney. Theres something to be said of course for a big-budget studio entertainment sly enough to retain a proper sense of mystery over its story and concept; much of the early buzz around ""Tomorrowland"" has swirled around the question of what its about -- and exactly how much it has to do with its namesake neighborhood at Disneyland. With one mercifully brief tongue-in-cheek exception scribes Bird and Damon Lindelof (who together conceived the story with Jeff Jensen) avoid exploiting such theme-park attractions as Space Mountain Star Tours and the dearly departed PeopleMover; if anything their vision of Tomorrowland draws more heavily on Epcot Center the ultimate representation of Walt Disneys guiding belief in science and technology as a force for good in the world. Few filmmakers would seem as ideally suited to honor that utopian ideal as Bird who previously tapped into the enterprising anything-is-possible ethos of 1950s-60s America in movies like ""The Incredibles"" with its snazzy retro-futuristic aesthetics and ""The Iron Giant"" with its sweet resonant treatment of Cold War anxieties. And there are setpieces in ""Tomorrowland"" -- a famous international landmark that suddenly bursts open like a Faberge egg or an ordinary-looking house that turns out to have so many gizmos pulleys booby traps and escape pods it might have been designed by Wallace and Gromit -- which duly explode with a welcome sense of invention and limitless possibility (most of it springing from Scott Chambliss wondrous production design). But these moments are relatively few and far between -- separated across long stretches of clunky storytelling overbearing action and tiresome character interplay and undermined by a narrative that never delivers the surge of escapist excitement seemingly promised at the outset. Striking a worrisome note early on is an overly cutesy framing device that introduces two narrators who cant stop arguing over how to tell their respective stories. The first of these is Frank Walker (Clooney) a curmudgeonly scientist who recounts how as a young boy (played by Thomas Robinson) he attended the 1964 New York Worlds Fair with his first big invention a jet pack that (sort of) gives its wearer the power of flight. Dismissed by a supercilious judge (Hugh Laurie) Frank manages to attract the interest of a sly watchful young girl named Athena (Raffey Cassidy) who hands him a small lapel pin marked with the letter ""T."" One bumpy elevator ride later Frank finds himself deposited in Tomorrowland a city of towering robots and sleek ivory-toned buildings where ones imagination can presumably run wild. But before we can learn why Frank was brought to Tomorrowland and what he accomplished there the film abruptly shifts to the present day. Our second narrator Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) is an extremely bright young woman in her 20s who lives with her father (Tim McGraw) and her little brother (Pierce Gagnon) in the shadow of the NASA station in Cape Canaveral Fla. Like Frank before her Casey boasts such keen intelligence and scientific acumen that she too receives a mysterious ""T"" pin; whenever (and only whenever) she touches it shes suddenly whisked off to Tomorrowland necessitating several seamless rapid-fire shifts in scenery. Its the films niftiest visual trick as well as a prelude to the one setpiece here that feels honestly transporting an extended tracking shot in which we follow Casey on a monorail ride through the city reveling in every otherworldly detail. (The context-free synchronized diving routine is a particular treat.) But Caseys trip is short-lived. After about two minutes of enraptured sight-seeing shes unceremoniously returned home leaving her desperate to find her way back. By this point the viewer is likely to understand all too well how she feels as ""Tomorrowland"" increasingly suggests a version of ""The Wizard of Oz"" that despite numerous attempts at liftoff never quite manages makes it over the rainbow. Indeed Casey herself comes to resemble a sort of reverse Dorothy Gale figure -- one eager to leave her humdrum existence not return to it -- as she hits the road and tries to find out who gave her the now-defunct pin. Its not long before she finds her answer in the form of the mysteriously ageless Athena who with typically well-meaning vagueness warns our heroine that she is in grave danger. What little sense of wonder remains at this point is decisively zapped away when ""Tomorrowland"" suddenly morphs into a paranoid thriller/road movie where danger lurks noisily behind every bend as signaled by the busy workings of Michael Giacchinos score. Athena persuades Casey to pay a visit to the cranky hermitlike Frank whom the android leaders of Tomorrowland banished years ago for making a startling discovery about the worlds impending doom. Its here that the ""Interstellar"" connection kicks in complete with (surrogate) father-daughter bond as Caseys inherent optimism becomes the necessary counterweight to Franks pessimism in the battle to save mankind. Its here too that the film reveals its intent as a humanitarian/ecological call to arms delivering an attack on widespread cynicism and apathy. These are weighty provocative worthwhile themes to implant in a PG-rated family film but the glaring failure of ""Tomorrowland"" is that its central premise -- children are the future -- is almost completely negated by the preachiness of the execution and the clumsiness of the storytelling. This is not frankly a movie that evinces much faith in the cognitive and imaginative powers of young people. Its attitude toward the tykes in the audience can be more or less summed up by the aggressively cheeky interplay between Clooney and Robertson and by the blunt often poorly motivated chase/action sequences (none of which rise to the level of Birds previous live-action feature ""Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol""). There is perhaps something almost perversely admirable about a movie called ""Tomorrowland"" that spends so little time in Tomorrowland effectively treating that storied kingdom less as an actual place than as a state of mind. Still its hard not to feel cheated or to wonder if it was Lindelof still best known for his work as a showrunner on ""Lost"" who effectively turned this movie into such an evasive and unsatisfying game of narrative keepaway -- one whose final revelations are dispensed in haste and with a frustrating lack of rigor. Indeed for all its insistence on the rational the picture at times gives off a bizarre faux-spiritual vibe -- not least in the recurring shots of the golden wheat fields outside Tomorrowland which look so vast and ripe they might have been filmed by Terrence Malick. (Claudio Miranda is credited with the cinematography which looks particularly lustrous in Imax projection.) These images figure prominently in the films jaw-droppingly misguided final scene a calculated bid for we-are-the-world sentimentality that plays out with the mildly unsettling overtones and forced multiculturalism of a cult recruitment video. Is this Tomorrowland or Heavens Gate? Robertson who bears an apt resemblance to Brit Marling is thoroughly winning in her first major starring role even if we must take Caseys much-vaunted brainpower on confidence (a montage of her raising her hand repeatedly in class is the scripts convenient way of signaling ""Shes smart"" without actually giving her anything smart to do or say). And the surprise of the picture may well be the young English actress Cassidy giving a small wonder of a performance that balances humor and poignancy in a deliberately narrow range. Comedy fans will smile -- briefly anyway -- at the sight of Keegan-Michael Key and Kathryn Hahn as a pair of geek enthusiasts who run a Houston shop crammed with classic sci-fi movie memorabilia (cue obligatory nod to the recently Disney-acquired ""Star Wars"" franchise). Clooney seems to have been cast as much for his liberal credentials as for his star power and its a choice that cant help but leave a somewhat smug aftertaste; hes almost too fitting a spokesman for a movie that urges humanity to end all wars take responsibility for the environment and foster a greater more alert engagement with the world around us. All worthy and admirable objectives to be sure but they cant help but feel like platitudes in the absence of an adventure that compels and sustains dramatic interest on its own terms. Even when delivered with the best intentions a lecture is a wretched substitute for wonder. Film Review TomorrowlandReviewed at TCL Chinese Theatre Hollywood May 6 2015. MPAA Rating PG.

LRV says June 14 2015 at 1034 am Disney what were you thinking There is no storyline to this movie it is LONG and BORING The acting is horrible and George Clooney in a childrens movie was a train wreck he looked so uncomfortable and definatly not a natural when it comes to interacting with children. Why the cursing in the movie was it necessary? Tomorrowland fooled us with the name Disney associated with it...absolutely the worst movie we have seen in a long time Money wasted Reply PG says May 27 2015 at 900 am The school montage was not signalling ""smart"" but ""questioning"" and above-all ""optimistic"". ""Smart"" came from remote control video interference and fixing her Dads machine. In any case it was her positivity and sense of optimism/wonder that made her the key figure she was. The final scenes were not ""forced multiculturalism"" but a signal of newfound inclusivity - the film had until then been about the elite and the few; by the end the realization was that being exclusive and restrictive was what had caused/exacerbated the problems of Tomorrowland. Heavyhanded metaphorical and a little preachy maybe. But no more inaccurate for it. There was one (ONE) Preachy speech and even it was (as noted here) less about the evils in the world and who caused them than the widespread apathy and ""let someone else do it"" short-term thinking that is clearly every bit the problem in our world that it was in theirs. Reply Tammy Kolii says May 26 2015 at 845 pm This movie was very entertaining and the kids loved it. Funny how anything that shines a light on positivism the importance of intellect science and conscientiousness is considered Liberal Propaganda. Just proves the point of this movie. Bye curmudgeons the rest of the world is leaving you behind Reply DM says May 24 2015 at 419 pm I WAS waiting with anticipation for this movie after seeing the trailers and what I saw and the kids saw really shocked and disappointed me and scared the little ones. Yes I know all about the troubles of this world and the evil people do to each other; yet this from DISNEY? I can hear the ground quaking with him spinning in his grave. Walt Disney and Disneyland is all about or was wonder and fantasy. Happiness and joy.. Walt Disney shared the possible future to us the world in his creations. The current ""Disney"" Corporation has gone far from that vision. Do we not see enough warrant less KILLING in the ""Real"" world today to go and see a ""Disney"" movie and see more warrant less killing? You should have been there when the kids screamed when the three cops were arbitrarily incinerated by ""killer"" Android robots in full CGI Glory in big clouds of black smoke. Yes I and others know we have ""eco"" problems in this world and yes people are working to correct that; BUT to spend allot of money to see a movie that is far from the ""trailer"" hype to doom and gloom end of the world. Disney WHAT WERE YOU THINKING TO GREEN LIGHT THIS GARBAGE.. Reply JC says June 12 2015 at 418 pm I can hear the ground quaking with him spinning in his grave. Walt Disney and Disneyland is all about or was wonder and fantasy. Happiness and joy.. Walt Disney shared the possible future to us the world in his creations BEAUTIFULLY SAID Reply PG says May 27 2015 at 909 am You saw ""incineration"" and smoke; we saw trans-dimensional warp and people not being killed but being shifted in space. No screams in our theater either (and interesting the children with us were more concerned with the uncanny valley and harm to people-like androids - the villains were ""people"" too - than the ambiguosly-vanished officials). Disney is about wonder fantasy enjoyment joy true - also awareness responsibility optimism for the future rooted in practicality in the present and that was all on display here. The basic message was ""ignoring problems will create worse ones; optimism and EFFORT will create the perfect future we can acchieve together."" Very Disney very true. But actively ignored by so many in so many ways day after day after day. Hugh Lauries characters frustrations with people expecting someone else to fix the problems they choose to ignore was well-founded (if admittedly heavy-handed). But if people wont listen to reason or facts delivered calmly or enthusiastically or worriedly or angrily... maybe a sledgehammer approach would be a bit better. Except that that often fails too as its ""preachy"" and ""politically-motivated"". Reply pj says May 24 2015 at 1207 pm Id just like to point out the fact that the writer of this review clearly fell asleep through the beginning where Casey attends high school. What 20 year old shares a room with their prepubescent brother abd gets reprimanded by her father for sneaking out of the house? Reply Paully says May 22 2015 at 426 pm Ive seen this before at Variety.. A group of ( paid?) Tea Party comments flood the legit comment section. Someone who never goes to the movies (stated) in 20 years .. Of course he is a regular reader of Variety.. Not.. Im guessing the break room at Breitbart. Or perhaps a Ted Cruz supporters group. This was a put up job on the comments obviously.. Reply kenjimoto says May 22 2015 at 439 pm Drudge apparently. Reply Sam America says May 23 2015 at 926 am Im not being paid you brainwashed liberal hack technology is destroying not only the human race but the youths brains with their iphones video games and electronic devices I see kids who cant even take their eyes and hands off their phones at work they cant even communicate with co workers or consumers they have no responsibility or morals or respect so go back to your progressive propaganda J.Means says May 18 2015 at 343 pm Clooney should just make ""Oh Brother Where Art T II and III"" and then call it a day. Reply Mantle Head says May 18 2015 at 330 pm A patronizing political statement masquerading as storytelling... Reply Just a guy says May 18 2015 at 254 pm Clooney is generally one of the most over-hyped faces out of the lala land that is Hollywood. Wouldnt waste my money. Tomorrowland will be free on Comcast soon enough... Reply manyland says May 18 2015 at 247 pm Ill never know....Clooney does not get any of my hard earned money no matter how good the show is. Reply Herbie Crossley says May 18 2015 at 227 pm So it aint worth downloading your saying..................... Reply Penswordman says May 18 2015 at 221 pm We are living in a highly tainted world lately. So many things lack substance and quality. WHAT is responsible for this tainting? Hmmmmm.... Reply Sandy Muller says May 18 2015 at 1257 pm Agenda Agenda Agenda Libs are the new nazis. Think just like THEM or perish. They preach tolerance but are the most intolerant people in North America. News flash The world doesnt want to COEXIST w/ Americas liberals it wants to KILL them. Clooney again. Ugh A few days ago he was handcuffed to the shockingly liberal David Letterman as a television skit. I really wish as Letterman goes away he would take the ever smug Clooney with him. Brad Bird is one of the great talents working today which adds to the heartbreak of this review. Reply kenjimoto says May 18 2015 at 225 pm I know the world has gone downhill ever since the Jews started rounding up Nazis in Germany. And all those KKK guys lynched in the South. Its getting so you just cant kill I mean trust anybody anymore. Reply Traci Wells says May 18 2015 at 1255 pm Anything that the Liberal Loon Clooney stars in is not worth seeing - Total trash Reply John Diamond says May 18 2015 at 1253 pm Another leftwing diatribe posing as a movie? NO thanks. No matter how many times Hollywood tries these propaganda pieces they fail miserably. Millions lost over the years simply to put forth an anti American anti Capitalist and anti republican agenda. Sorry Hollywood you have been playing this same script for decades and America is not interested. Reply mikey1109 says May 18 2015 at 1240 pm I will not be wasting my money on this one. Suffering through the preview was more than enough for me. Reply PG says May 19 2015 at 1053 am Presuming you didnt deliberately seek out the trailer what movie(s) did you see that it was paired with...? Reply Bob Thebobster says May 18 2015 at 1153 am Sounds like the libs version of Galts Gulch. Reply Jim Wood says May 18 2015 at 1148 am Once I saw that Tim McGraw was in this flick my decision to NOT see it was made. Reply Jim Gajewski says May 18 2015 at 1117 am well what do you expect from someone who supports hillary Reply kenjimoto says May 18 2015 at 1119 am You sure can hold a Drudge Reply charlesamiller says May 18 2015 at 1104 am Once more Disney sucks. Reply eggmann says May 18 2015 at 1055 am Too bad. I was hoping for a good Disney movie. Clooney being in it couldnt have helped. Reply woodNfish says May 18 2015 at 1053 am I knew the movie was crap as soon as I saw the calving glacier. This is just another shrill eco-whackjob movie with ""stupid"" as a plot and ""even dumber"" for dialogue. Only someone who wants their kids indoctrinated into the whacko Leftist theology of environmentalism is going to pay to let their kids see this propagandized drivel. Reply kenjimoto says May 18 2015 at 1109 am Yeah cause what could be dumber than teaching your kids to love their planet? Calving glaciers--screw them The world filled with people of all color and types and its important to get those children to hate and fear all the things that make you scared and small. So good job so far Reply Dan says May 18 2015 at 1036 am Sorry. Im bored of the reused plot about one person (majority of the time its some kid) destined to save the world something similar. I dot think George is good at acting its like he plays himself in movies (i.e. Oceans movies Interstellar etc.) Reply John Galt says May 18 2015 at 1032 am Damon Lindelof Explains it all. Remember that whatever the big important reveal is is a head fake and has no point just as Im sure this whole movie has no point except to sell tickets to DisneyWorld/Land. Come to think of it this is a perfect movie to send the kids to while you go to Mad Max and watch what a talented filmmaker can do. Reply Frederick Louis Richardson says May 18 2015 at 1003 am No amount of below the line talent or above the line star power will substitute for a fresh idea. Let us assume the world is ""saved"" ...or cant be. Now wheres the meat of an idea and not just the potatoes? This review is a too long for a movie short on ideas. Reply Ksera says May 18 2015 at 947 am Clooney........Im out. Reply al says May 18 2015 at 859 am Anybody ever notice that Clooney plays himself in every movie he is in? Reply John says May 18 2015 at 858 am And please dont blame George Clooney for this. He is a gifted actor who still cares to keep up filmmaking as an art form and not a as a noisy dreadful box of repetitive tricks and idiocy. Reply John says May 18 2015 at 847 am Damon Lindelof made a mess of Prometheus (with the complicity of Ridley Scott) and evidently got ""Lost"" in his own labyrinth with the series messy ending. Its a pity that such a giftes director as Brad Bird allowed this to happen. And by the way Hollywood its the script. stupid Reply Sam America says May 23 2015 at 930 am hes a fing hippocrite like all rich hollyweird Washington and other progressives who push their crap on the rest of us and we pay for it with higher taxes unemployment gas food healthcare etc...which doesnt effect their sorry asses who have money and get richer while the rest of us get poorer Reply PG says May 27 2015 at 913 am Maybe the 1% should pay higher taxes so they feel the pinch as well? And naturally all political parties are pulling for that so its all good. Things will be better tomorrow when that happens. Healthcare costs rising can be easily addressed by nationalized healthcare - as in the rest of the industtialized world - and that also politically and widely popular. Hooray for the future grumpiestoldman says May 18 2015 at 820 am Tim McGraws in it Must be awesome Did he bring his hairpiece too? Reply Mantle Head says May 18 2015 at 333 pm Why do you want your own back? Reply Scott Durso says May 18 2015 at 816 am Damon Lindelof... need I say anything else? Guy is poison for scripts screenplays narrative characters etc. That said Brad Bird is the man. I was hopeful he could make a gem on this otherwise unappealing concept and over-ride the Lindelof affect... but from the sound of it that just wasnt possible. And if Brad Bird couldnt do it I HIGHLY doubt anyone else could have. Redbox rental I suppose. Reply Mr. Bill says May 18 2015 at 755 am Clooney said he would do everything in his power to get Hillary elected president. Boycott his movies. Make him irreverent. Reply Bill B. says May 18 2015 at 914 am I think the word you are looking for is irrelevant much like your comment. Reply robertnotsowise says May 18 2015 at 736 am oh. damon lindelof wrote it. of COURSE it stinks Reply yirmin snipe says May 18 2015 at 725 am My kids actually wanted to see it... but I said no. Not because of George Clooneys beliefs... but because he is a crappy actor that only got a job because he came from the right scrotum.. Even if his political beliefs matched mine to a ""T"" I would still find his pompous attitude and inability to act enough reason not to waste money on the movie. Reply Mantle Head says May 18 2015 at 335 pm Let your kids see it... why be mean? Reply PG says May 19 2015 at 1058 am Presumably the children of such a critically-minded person must also be very discerning in what theyll actually want to watch..... William Speers says May 18 2015 at 642 am A sort of Interstellar Jr. in which the fate of humanity hinges on our ability to nurture young hearts and minds..."" Wow something new in movie plots Reply jpaq68 says May 18 2015 at 632 am I dont think Walt Disneys vision of EPCOT was a 100 a day theme park Reply Space Ranger says May 18 2015 at 859 am You do know that the ticket price of 105 is designed to control crowd sizes at the parks without cutting into the bottom line right? If Disneys parks were not so popular this would not be possible. Reply AbortYourself says May 20 2015 at 737 am What? Are you implying that the ticket cost is used as a form of discrimination? Keep the ""trash"" out so to speak? What a liberal concept like poll taxes and competency tests for voting Democrats didnt want those former slaves to vote so they devised methods to discriminate. Well in all fairness Democrats actually preferred eugenics but somehow that never caught on. Now all they do is call everyone else a racist. corvetteman6 says May 18 2015 at 542 am I like George Clooney. I could care less about his politics. Its a shame Variety chooses to post comments from the outer fringe of our society. Its like the entire card-carrying Tea Party shows up to post their mentally constipated blather. Who cares? Its entertainment. Reply Robert German says May 18 2015 at 308 pm Im not a member of the Tea Party or any Political party having said that Clooney still sucks. Reply Sandy Muller says May 18 2015 at 102 pm Yes only liberal comments should be posted here. Again notice how intolerant those are preach tolerance are? Bastards. They also never have any facts to back up their arguments its always just emotion. Reply kenjimoto says May 18 2015 at 230 pm This is Variety you moron. Its an industry trade paper. There are normally very few comments here and those are from people who have actually seen the movie or have some genuine interest in it. Not everyone is led by the nuts some version of Matt Drudge. Anyway your concept of testing tolerance is to poke something with a stick and see if it bites back. Maybe liberals dont everything--they just hate you woodNfish says May 18 2015 at 1055 am ""Who cares? Its entertainment."" Actually it is propaganda wrapped up as entertainment. Reply DJH says May 18 2015 at 722 am The outer fringe? Guess what - most of us dont go to the theater anymore precisely because were tired of the mindless celebritwits attacking average Americans. The fringe - look in the mirror buddy - youre the fringe and your tired cowardly mindless attacks on those you dont agree with is just further proof of how small minded you are Reply Sam America says May 23 2015 at 932 am but the brainwashed braindead left wing progressives dont see it that way they are zombies they are told what to think eat dress wear watch buy drive etc...and they just obey kenjimoto says May 18 2015 at 1006 am Wrong. You paranoid America-haters are on the way out. Youre just a lot noisier than regular people who are trying to enjoy their lives and talk about ya know movies. TruthHurts says May 18 2015 at 705 am His acting is as lousy as his politics. You state you could care less about politics but then you turn right around and attempt to bash an entire political group based upon conjecture. Phooey.

Have you stopped watching TV? Or do you feel that theater tickets are over-priced - or are you just posturing? kenjimoto says May 18 2015 at 354 pm And thats why you are irresistibly drawn to Variety right?

Reply Socraticsilliness says May 18 2015 at 344 am It sounds awful. The reviewer spent way too many words trying to say something we all kind of figured for ourselves. Reply jvjjj says May 18 2015 at 329 am Clooney is more interested in furthering his political agenda than he is in providing entertainment value. Reply Jane says May 18 2015 at 306 am Sounds dreadful. I will pass on this one. Reply Lex says May 18 2015 at 206 am I saw a preview of the movie and couldnt tell you what it was about.

Reply sailordude says May 18 2015 at 1226 am Since it had Clooney in it preaching about the ""future"" I had zero interest in it and thought many others would feel the same.

Jane says May 18 2015 at 307 am You might try to refrain from calling people names whose opinions you disagree with. Very intolerant of you. ezeealrm says May 17 2015 at 1111 pm If the theme park Tomorrowland were as boring looking as the movie it would be a ghost town. Probably make more money overseas where downbeat over seriousness sells. Reply Tony Redunzo says May 17 2015 at 1026 pm Clooney is wooden as an actor.

So it has come to this A big-budget futuristic effects-heavy star-driven fantasy-oriented audience-friendly beautifully made would-be summer tentpole looks something like a freak not to mention a semi-risky proposition because it is not part of a franchise. But thats how it is in the summer of 2015 for Tomorrowland a sparkling work of speculative fiction (and wishful thinking) that could not be more ""Disney"" in the old-fashioned sense but is dominated by its philosophical thrust against social pessimism and disenchantment. Theoretically the required ingredients for a big summer hit are mostly present and accounted for but the considerable question remains as to whether the mass audience of the moment is ready to embrace an inventive but less overwhelmingly Marvelous adventure fantasy than is the current norm. In his own way director Brad Bird who wrote the script with Damon Lindelof from a story they cooked up with Jeff Jensen has made a counter-present culture work that amplifies and synthesizes impulses that have driven at least some of his previous films. In Iron Giant and The Incredibles he explicitly used his fondness for post-World War II sci-fi and fantasy as a motivating point for his massively entertaining but also thoughtful appreciation of the positive can-do ethos of the period. The evil came from the forces that would thwart the skys-the-limit achievement of the worlds best brightest and right-minded and frustration with those who would impede excellence and forward-thinking on all fronts is the sentiment that grumbles and groans beneath the shiny surfaces of Tomorrowland.

Not a slum traffic jam or pollution-belching factory was to be seen. Tomorrowland opens with grizzled George Clooney as Frank Walker telling us ""When I was a kid the future was different"" whereupon we see his young self (the ideally cast Thomas Robinson) enthusiastically toting his homemade ""jet pack"" invention (actually a modified Electrolux vacuum cleaner) to the Worlds Fair. His creation needs more time in the lab but while there he encounters an immoderately self-possessed British-accented girl about his own age named Athena (Raffey Cassidy) who will shortly usher him into a very privileged realm. Forty-five years later a slightly older teenager Casey Newton (Britt Robertson) also harbors fantasies about flying and the future but they are seemingly dashed dreams; shes obsessed with a Texas NASA rocket launch site that is now being demolished a place where her unemployed father (Tim McGraw) was once an engineer. Her toy drone isnt going to take her anywhere but she mysteriously obtains something else that does a small pin with a big ""T"" emblazoned on it that when touched instantly transports her to a beautiful wheat field from which she can glimpse very much as Dorothy and her companions did when they arrived in the poppy field an extraordinary city looming in the distance. In this instance however what lies before the dazzled Casey is the future -- be it an alternate one an upcoming one or possibly a version thats already passed. But real it is; she can walk around the spotlessly modernistic buildings (to an extent those of the City of Arts and Sciences in Valencia Spain designed by Santiago Calatrava) take the nifty conveyance that loops and swoops around them observe the impeccably groomed and civilized people that inhabit the place and marvel at a world with no visible impediments to living a pure life of the mind and achievement. Unfortunately Casey doesnt understand how to control her access in and out of this wonder world so shes bounced back to Houston where the film bogs down in some soft and belabored peril involving first some suspicious vintage toyshop owners (Kathryn Hahn and Keegan-Michael Key) and then some Matrix-like robot police goons who come after Casey as well as Clooneys Frank; the latter re-enters the action nearly an hour in to voice his disillusionment with what the world has come to be since he dropped out explain things to the unquenchably curious Casey and inevitably enable her ultimate access to the heart of Tomorrowland and its mysteries. A hermit and all-round malcontent Frank was the instigating genius and visionary behind one of humanitys great leaps forward. At first he tells Casey to forget all about it angrily assuring her that she has been manipulated ""What you saw is gone"" he says. But he ultimately cant help but see his younger self in her as his optimistic side is re-animated by this kids excitement over what the future still could become. One of the films most spectacularly fanciful conceits is to stage the launch of a rocket thats somehow hidden in the middle of the Eiffel Tower an event that doesnt take place until Frank shows Casey the private office of the monuments designer Gustave Eiffel -- where he supposedly created the utopian secret society ""Plus Ultra"" with special guests Jules Verne Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla (with full acknowledgement that the latter two hated each other). How many sci-fi/fantasy films of recent years have climaxed with anything other than massive conflict and conflagration? Whatever the number Tomorrowland is one of the few to place far more emphasis on talk than action which is what will probably contribute to what for some will make for a softer experience than the genre norm. The films general coolness and vision of a potentially serene future reminds more of Spike Jonzes Her than of anything in the Marvel George Lucas or James Cameron-derived worlds not to mention other far more violent ones. As thoughtful and sympathetic as the intentions are here perhaps it all goes back to the point often made about Dante What do people read and remember? Paradiso Purgatorio or Inferno? Another issue that might serve to hold the film back with teenage audiences (it shouldnt bother younger ones) is that the key reference points are saturated with a nostalgia -- both specific in terms of Disneyland and the Worlds Fair and philosophically -- that will mean far more to older viewers than it will to them. All hands on both sides of the camera do outstanding work. Clooney seems to be enjoying himself thoroughly as the old grump whose creative flame hasnt been entirely extinguished but it falls more to Robertson to carry the film which she does with great energy and appeal. Cassidy has an eerie presence that adds mystery to an already mysterious role while Hugh Laurie makes a decided impression as an old cohort of Franks. The films immaculate exceedingly clean look owes much to cinematographer Claudio Miranda production designer Scott Chambliss and the usual parade of technical wizards who know how to conceal every seam in the modern filmmaking process. Michael Giacchinos score energetically pushes things along but cant disguise the films moderate over-length.

Slapped With 130 Million Lawsuit for Alleged Fraud Clooney and Britt Robertson star in the film that mimics a roller coaster ride by making us wait far too long for too little payoff If youre tired of watching the world end youre not alone. In its darkest and most compelling scene the dystopian-future drama ""Tomorrowland"" lashes out against its genre delivering a ""Network""-esque what-the-hell-are-we-all-doing rant about being passively entertained rather than driven to action by depictions of our own doom. Unfortunately the rest of this willfully optimistic film is nowhere near as smart despite centering on two science prodigies played by George Clooney and Britt Robertson (""The Longest Ride""). Named after one of Disneylands least interesting themed areas ""Tomorrowland"" is a globe-trotting time-traveling caper whose giddy visual whimsies and exuberant cartoon violence are undermined by a coy mystery that stretches as long as the line for ""Space Mountain"" on a hot summer day. Directed by Brad Bird (""The Incredibles"" ""Ratatouille"" ""Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol"") and written by Bird and ""Lost"" showrunner Damon Lindelof ""Tomorrowland"" feels -- perhaps appropriately for a movie based on an amusement park -- like a narrative version of those videos that play above roller coasters today. Clooney and Robertson spend as much time ducking and dodging flying gizmos as they do moving the plot along. The film begins with a boy inventor (Thomas Robinson) zooming literally through a cornfield on his defective jet pack stalks slapping his screaming face as he hurtles toward a bruising crash -- and only gets busier bouncier and more aerodynamically improbable from there. Also Read 50 Actors Over 50 Who Are Still Conquering Hollywood (Photos) That boy grows up to be the reclusive Frank (Clooney) who was once invited to join the enigmatic Tomorrowland by two of its recruiters (Raffey Cassidy and Hugh Laurie) at the 1964 Worlds Fair but has since returned home an ornery middle-aged man. A thousand miles away Casey (Robertson) -- an athletic cheerful mildly rebellious STEM nerd imagineered for parental approval - is given a pin that transports her at least perceptually to the outskirts of Tomorrowland. Her body is still stuck in 2015 though leading to several runs into walls and tumbles down stairs until she problem solves a way into the gleaming and bustling metropolis of the future. The pins powers dont last but shes seen enough and cant get enough. With the help of a Tomorrowland ambassador in the guise of an acrobatic combat-ready little girl named Athena (Cassidy) - who had earlier brought Frank to her hometown - Casey eventually makes her way to Franks house. He greets her with an artificial gust of wind that knocks her on her back three feet away but thats nothing compared to the face-smooshing and head twisting he offers the android assassins who come after him and Casey. Still it takes awhile for cranky Frank to be drawn into Tomorrowlands problems again. His cynicism is countered by Casey for whom the futuristic city represents the opposite of everything shes learning in school dystopias in English nuclear annihilation in history environmental collapse in science. The pair plummet down a tub fly up a rocket ship (hidden inside the Eiffel Tower natch) and make their way back to Tomorrowland which now looks eerily empty like well an amusement park at midnight. Also Read Iranian Paper Shut Down for Publishing George Clooney Je Suis Charlie Photo Its all goofy exhilarating fun until the film is weighed down by its own delaying tactics What is Tomorrowland and why is it no longer thriving? Who created those robots and why are they after Frank and Casey? Clooney supplies non-stop exposition throughout and yet never enough by design of course. For all of Tomorrowlands infrastructural marvels - tiered swimming pools astro-commutes and beautiful tangles of airborne boulevards -- the world-building is thin and unsatisfying. Blame the plot structure the would-be emotional payoff arrives long after were worn out and no longer interested in the mystery like an overcooked steak that reaches the table after weve filled up on bread. Also Read Party Report in Pictures George Clooney Kerry Washington Julia Roberts Eva Longoria (Photos) Birds nostalgia for 50s-era optimism -- a simplistic version of the war-born futurism that led Walt Disney to create Tomorrowland at his landmark theme park -- is too gee-whiz to be convincing. ""Imagination is more important than knowledge"" says one character to which a thousand parents would rejoin ""Not in this economy"" More persuasive is Birds plea to examine what exactly we get out of looking at our world turn into the one in ""Wall-E."" Nero at least did something while Rome burned. Were just sitting around watching it happen. Breaking News To Your Inbox.
