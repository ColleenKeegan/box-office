Should we or should we not take our daughters to see that Justin Bieber 3-D movie? (See TIMEs picks for the 83rd annual Academy Awards.) For many busy moms Bieber is one of those youthful obsessions they can mostly ignore like Silly Bandz. Since hes big on opt-in media like YouTube (where he has 950000 followers) and Twitter (where he has 7 million) rather than on TV hes a cultural artifact that can be known about without actually being experienced. Until now. His 3-D concert movie-biopic Justin Bieber Never Say Never opens in 3105 places this weekend amid a heavy marketing campaign. Your children may not be able to resist the lure of that hair any longer. (See photos of Justin Bieber.) In order to make life easier for mothers everywhere this writer took two preteen girls to find out a) if its worth shelling out 16 a ticket and 115 minutes of your day b) if it will spark an outbreak of Biebermania in otherwise unaffected tweens and c) if mothers will wish to inject neat Clorox into their eyeballs afterward just to try to erase the memory. The verdict unless theyve already been infected Justin Bieber Never Say Never will not give your children a case of drooling Bieberfever. The surprise is that mothers may be a little more susceptible. The film is a finely woven mom-catching trap. The action moves back and forth between biography -- Justin as an adorable toddler being brought up by his feisty faithful teen mom in a small Ontario town -- and concert footage. Interviews with dozens of girls choking up about their feelings for him are intercut with scenes of his grandparents making him tidy his room and lots of praying. While his show-business handlers marvel at his freakish talent he gets chided by his vocal coach Mama Jan for eating food out of a backstage trash can. (""But I put it there"" he protests.) As a biopic Never Say Never is relentlessly upbeat. Biebers defining characteristic apart from his sweetness might be his ambition. His former soccer coach reminisces about how Justin never learned to pass the ball. Much is made by the adults around him of the speed of his rise -- he was still performing in school gyms as recently as 2009 -- and his work ethic. We watch old video of him midway between YouTube fame and superstardom singing for local radio DJs in an effort to get airplay for his songs of unabashed puppy love. He sings all the time. After being told not to he tries to sing Usher to Usher at their first meeting. When the Ramp;B crooner eventually hears him he takes the boy under his wing; by 2010 Bieber is selling out Madison Square Garden -- and giving a leg up in the business to Will Smiths kid Jaden who provides one of several famous cameos in the movie. (Miley Cyrus and Kobe Bryant also pop up.) All this and he never stops beings so darned polite. In short its a movie carefully crafted to appeal to a Bieber fans gatekeeper -- her mom. After all the mothers are the ones who will be chaperones financiers and splurgers on T-shirts and posters. Not many tweens can afford concert tickets. Never Say Nevers message Follow your dreams (very nicely). What mom could argue with that? (See a TIME video of Bieber fever in New York City.) Case in point what self-respecting tween would enjoy the same musicians her mother does? Heres how our tweens -- Hannah 11 and Ginger 10 -- saw it Were you dying to see that movie? Hannah No. I dont think he should be that famous. Ginger I dont think girls should be obsessing over him. Well what would have made you see it? Ginger If a friend invited me and theyd already paid for the tickets. Hannah Even then if I had homework I dont think Id go. Did your opinion of him change after the film? Ginger I used to think every girl who liked him was dumb. Now I sort of understand it more. I understood him more than as just some dude who always has girls all over him. Wouldnt you like just a little bit to be Justin Biebers girlfriend? Hannah No. Youd never have a real relationship with all those screaming lunatics around all the time. Ginger ... and knowing that all those girls hated you. Well should we buy one of his albums? Hannah No. Ginger No. Download one of his songs? Ginger Maybe. Wouldnt you at least like to follow him on Twitter? Hannah Whats Twitter? Oh. Well how would you feel if you saw him on the street? Hannah I guess Id be kind of psyched. Oh come on. Hes so cute. Hannah Maybe if I got a free ticket to his concert. Didnt the scene where his friends gave out free tickets make you cry? Hannah No but if I stared at the screen too hard the 3-D glasses made my eyes water. Seriously wouldnt you cry a bit if you got free tickets? Ginger I think Id give them to someone who really wanted them. You wouldnt want to go up on stage and be ""the lonely girl"" (the fan who gets taken on stage to be serenaded by Bieber)? Hannah No Im scared of crowds. I dont even talk in class. Ginger No I dont want him touching my body. Are you guys totally sure hes not cute? Ginger I thought he was talented ... but he needs to pull his pants up. Hannah Oh all boys do that. I cant believe you guys didnt like him. Hannah Some of the fans seemed too old. And I saw a man in the crowd. Ginger I didnt realize the fans would be so desperate. So you really dont feel any different about him after seeing that movie? Ginger A smidge. I dont hate him. But I dont like him. Hannah I think hes O.K. Hes just a normal kid. Except hes a pop star. His whole life is not normal. Hmmm. What would it take for you to see the movie again? Hannah If Ginger was desperate to go again Id go. Ginger Id go again for say 100. The Great Gatsby in 3-D see TIMEs top 10 movie gimmicks. See the 20 best Halloween costumes of 2010.

Never Say Never is just what the doctor ordered Updated February 9 2011 828 AM By RAFER GUZMAN rafer.guzmannewsday.com + - Justin Bieber sings during a scene from ""Justin Bieber Never Say Never."" Photo Credit Paramount Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A combination concert film and documentary about the 16-year-old pop phenom BOTTOM LINE A nearly two-hour Justin Bieber commercial destined for tearful accolades from fans. CAST Justin Bieber Miley Cyrus Usher Jaden Smith WHEN/WHERE ""Never Say Never"" showtimes and tickets LENGTH 145 A heartfelt thank-you from 16-year-old singer Justin Bieber to his millions of fans and an equally sincere plea for them not to forget him when the next doe-eyed cutie-pie rolls around the concert film ""Justin Bieber Never Say Never"" manages the neat trick of making a mass-marketed pop act seem like the kid next door. No matter how far away he looks on that stage Bieber belongs to you and you and you. Though its essentially one long advertisement ""Never Say Never"" doesnt pretend to be anything else. Directed by Jon M. Chu (the ""Step Up"" dance-flick franchise) the movie draws a rough narrative arc by following Bieber on his 2010 tour leading up to a sold-out concert at Madison Square Garden. There is some ginned-up drama - will Justins vocal cords recover in time for the Garden? OMG - but mostly its a fans wish list of backstage banter adorable baby photos and the occasional glimpse of Biebers bare torso. advertisement | advertise on newsday Despite itself the film ends up providing a peek into the youth-entertainment machine. Scott ""Scooter"" Braun who discovered Bieber via a homemade YouTube video is justifiably proud of encouraging Biebers Internet-marketing potential (the singer now has 6.9 million followers on Twitter) while music impresario Antonio ""L.A."" Reid admits without a trace of mockery that he signed Bieber thinking ""Wow its the Macaulay Culkin of music."" Its hard to say which man is the greater visionary. Of all the talking heads in the film Bieber talks the least. Mostly he sings fan favorites like ""Baby"" ""U Smile"" and the title song occasionally joined by guest stars like Usher Jaden Smith Miley Cyrus and Sean Kingston. But this too may be a ploy. Its a way to keep Bieber close but not too close to his fans.

By David Edelstein Published Feb 11 2011 ShareThis Justin Bieber in Never Say Never.  (Photo Courtesy of Paramount Pictures) On our way to the concert documentary Justin Bieber Never Say Never my 12-year-old daughter asked Dad do you think theyd mind if during the movie I screamed? I said I thought the studio would be thrilled if she added her scream to the sum of all screams She would thereby prove herself a True Belieber. The film as it turns out is packed with little girls screamingand moaning and weeping and looking as if theyre ten seconds away from setting themselves on fire. Id have screamed myself if I were a student of marketing. Its a really hot piece of packaging. The key of course is that Bieber is presented as a kid who rose to stardom without the aid of corporate packaging. Never Say Never opens with a computer screen and a mouse clicking on early YouTube viral videos laughing babies cute dogs etc. Then theres this little Canadian hair-helmet in a paneled room a small-town boy with a big-city voice. Hey check out this kid reads a fake but representative e-mail. Bieber were told is the first social-network superstar. He might well be but the packagers have certainly arrived. The movie is cunningly woven to show the tension between his insane abnormal success and his vow to remain a sane normal 16-year-old. In this were told his background is crucial. His very young parents split when he was 10 months old but he always had the love of his mother and her mom and dad not to mention God and Jesus. No Disney incubator belched him forth. His manager Scott Scooter Braun first saw him on YouTube but couldnt interest record companies without the Disney or Nickelodeon imprimatur. So Braun enlisted Usher whom Bieber idolized and Usher brought in producer Antonio L.A. Reid. But in the end Bieber sold himself on the road in big and little markets strumming and crooning for D.J.s until little girls began to mass outside radio stations like zombies in a George Romero movie. Director Jon M. Chu jumps back and forth between the account of Biebers rise (with adorable home movies) and the countdown to his sold-out August 2010 concert at the pinnacle Madison Square Garden Ten Days to Madison Square Garden ... Nine Days to Madison Square Garden  Since Bieber is already playing to sold-out arenas theres little in the way of suspenseuntil he starts to lose his voice and has to cancel a show in Syracuse. A doctor arrives. Justins tonsils in close-up look bad. Theres gonna be a lot of kids let down says Bieber. But you gotta beliebe. I saw Bieber perform over a year ago at a kiddie lollapalooza concert on Long Island and he was in a different league from the other entities. He has a voice that needs no help from sound mixers and an easy effortless-seeming slickness. The songs are about love and if that sounds generic so do they. That said having risen out of the social network he has more communication tools at his disposal than say Donny Osmond in his day. In the middle of Baby he raps Yeah Im 16 and I thought that youd be mine / I used to tweet you and text you and call you and hit you on Facebook all the time Cant believe that you did me wrong / We were on iChat all night long. The point is that Bieber is but a click away. One day I tweeted him 100 times brags one girl. Another gushes I think about him like 99 percent of my life. And with all that social media she can. In concert one girl is always pulled from her seat to sit on a stool onstage during the number One Less Lonely Girl. As the blonde lass weeps and weeps while Bieber descends messianically to give her life (and a bouquet) I checked out my daughter and her friendboth rapt both crying. I find him such a bland pious profoundly unthreatening little Furby of a pop idol but little girls celebrity crushes are not to be trifled with. And this sensationally engineered promo film makes Justin Bieber look like a true force of nature. The first of the late Rosemary Sutcliffs stirring YA novels about the ancient Roman occupation of Britain The Eagle of the Ninth came out in 1954 a couple of years before the Suez Crisis and is relatively unencumbered by pesky imperialist guilt. True the Romans are said to have stolen lands and slaughtered a lot of natives. Theres that. But on the whole Sutcliff finds them a civilizing force; and when the last of them flee (in the third novel of the series) after 400 years its a tragedy for all concerned. The Eagle the unfashionably exciting adaptation directed by Kevin Macdonald from a script by Jeremy Brock doesnt lay on any anachronistic anti-imperialist sentiments eitherthe Romans are not Americans the Brits are not Iraqis or Afghans. Here conquest is a fact Deal with it. More important deal with it manfully. 1 2 Next Share this story...

"Justin Bieber Never Say Never review Movie offers adoring view of a pop sensation |       NJ.com comments Justin Bieber Never Say Never review Movie offers adoring view of a pop sensation Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on February 11 2011 at 759 AM updated February 12 2011 at 249 PM View/Post Comments Paramount PicturesTeenage pop sensation Justin Bieber reaches out to his fans in the documentary ""Never Say Never."" Making cruel fun of Justin Bieber is too easy -- not that we should let that stop us. He owes his fame to YouTube clips shopping-mall appearances and 11-year-old girls. His famous moptop looks like something he stole from a 70s Ice Capades queen. He is uncool. To which like millions of his 11-year-old fans I can only say -- yeah well whatever. Because Justin Bieber is not about you or me any more than the Monkees (or Shaun Cassidy or Rick Springfield or Hanson -- pick your generations guilty pleasure) were about our parents. He is about creating pure palatable pop for pubescents. And thats a tougher job than most are willing to admit. Movie Review Never Say Never (G) Paramount (105 min.) Directed by Jon M. Chu. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains nothing to offend. Stephen Whittys Review TWO AND A HALFSTARS So give the boy credit -- and his new 3D concert film ""Justin Bieber Never Say Never"" does just that. But the movie remains so sanitized so authorized that it never gives us credit for being able to make up our own minds about him and what he represents. Questions that tweens might want to know (""Does Justin have a girlfriend?"") arent answered here. Ones that parents would like to hear (""Is this boy getting any real education at all?"") mostly go unasked. And several uncomfortable details -- such as the story that Justins mother was reluctant to let him sign his first professional contract because the manager was Jewish -- are steered well clear of. Thats all to be expected. This is just another shrink-wrapped pop-star product after all. Still the film -- directed by a veteran of two of the ""Step Up"" dance movies -- occasionally has a sly sense of humor. It begins by placing Bieber in the proper historical context -- as a viral internet sensation like videos of cute kittens or wedding-day disasters. It includes a slow-motion love song to the famous hair. And (although oddly there are few scenes of Bieber really rehearsing) there is plenty of footage of his rise to the top -- years of local talent shows and water-park concerts sometimes in amateur video so blurry its practically impressionistic. The boy works hard. Still his dancing is more athletic than artistic (when Usher joins him onstage briefly the older star blows him away with a quick hip swivel). Hes almost 17 yet his voice and face are stuck in childhood. (Its almost creepy to see screaming adult women among his fans). Not that younger fans will pay much attention to any of this. The overproduced music pounds away expertly. The lyrics are perfectly squeaky-clean. The image -- all baseball caps and hearts and hoodies and purple -- is consistent and endlessly marketable. No Justin Bieber is clearly making a lot of people a lot of money including his somewhat sanctimonious mother and awfully slick manager. But who is Justin Bieber really and who might he become? For all its vaunted 3D effects ""Never Say Never"" never gets closer to its subject than the cheap seats.

"Review Never Say Never is Bieber for beginners - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon LinkedIn Review Never Say Never is Bieber for beginners By Tom Charity Special to CNN The film ""Justin Bieber Never Say Never"" traces the life and career of teen singing sensation Justin Bieber. STORY HIGHLIGHTS""Justin Bieber Never Say Never"" is part concert movie part bio of the singerFans paid about 40 for preview screenings of the 3-D filmThe movie contains footage of the singer before he became famous RELATED TOPICS Justin Bieber Movies Music Entertainment Movie Reviews (CNN) -- Depending on your age Justin Bieber is either a dim blip on your fading pop culture radar or like the hottest thing ever. At nationwide preview screenings Wednesday evening his fans paid in the region of 40 a ticket to be the first to see the Biebsters 3-D feature documentary -- and if the audience I saw it with was typical they loved every minute of it. The demographics were school-age and 98 percent female. Of the 10 guys I counted Id say one was a dad and at least five of the rest were paid to be there (like me). As for the girls they screamed as they lined up outside the theater and they screamed as they raced to grab their seats. They screamed when the MTV logo came up and they screamed when they saw the name of Biebers production company. When their idols baby pictures came up on screen they screamed at those. They screamed when his old high school buddies appeared and they screamed even louder when the 12-year-old Bieber started to sing in one of the home movies that launched his career. Biebermania may not have the staying power of Beatlemania -- and at 16 Justin is three years older than Little Stevie Wonder was when he topped the singles charts in 1963 -- but its hard to think of anyone else who has come so far so fast. Unlike Michael Jackson he wasnt born into a showbiz family. Unlike Britney or the Jonas boys he wasnt a graduate of the Mickey Mouse Club talent school -- or any other school for that matter unless you can be a graduate of YouTube. Bieber was homegrown talent an only child brought up by his mom and his grandparents in Stratford Ontario. By the age of 3 he was drumming and at 8 he was good enough that a local Christian group held a benefit gig to buy him a proper set. He entered a local talent show at 12 as a singer but came in second. It was his YouTube posts that caught the eye of his future manager Scooter Braun and it was YouTube that gave him a platform (in July last year Biebers song ""Baby"" became the most viewed YouTube video ever). ""Justin Bieber Never Say Never"" is less a traditional concert movie than a backstage pass the chance to hang out with the team the manager the mentor (Usher) the vocal coach (Mama Jan) the stylist the mom and of course the talent. They seem like a good bunch. Theres a lot of banter group prayers (Bieber is a Christian) and when push comes to shove -- when hes told hell have to postpone a concert or risk canceling several -- this clean-cut polite 16-year-old toes the line and does what hes told. Directed by John Chu (""Step Up 3D"") the film fills in more backstory than we usually get in these things in part because Justins family seems to have taken their archival responsibilities seriously from an early age and maybe because he doesnt have that much interesting to say for himself (or to sing about) just yet. The movie is both up front (we see the absent dad tearfully watching his boy perform) and disingenuous (no one talks about the split the father-son dynamics or how it might have fueled Justins relentless drive to succeed). Like JBs Twitter account it presents a superficial intimacy without risking anything too personal. Which may be all his teenage fans want or can handle right now. On stage at a sold-out show at Madison Square Garden Bieber is skinny lithe super-confident and unformed. Hes still more of a child prodigy brilliantly mimicking the moves hes picked up from TV than an authentic voice. Though in fairness as the movie makes clear he was fighting off a throat infection at the time. When Miley Cyrus joins him on stage for a duet the 18-year-old veteran looks so much more mature that it seems like she might eat him alive. He can make the girls cry with happiness yet theres no sign hes ever had a meaningful relationship with one.

Paramount Pictures hide caption toggle caption Paramount Pictures Justin Bieber Never Say Never Director Jon M. Chu Genre Musical Biography Running Time 105 minutes Rated G With Justin Bieber Usher Raymond Miley Cyrus Watch Clips Drums Drums Credit Paramount Pictures Hand-To-Hand Combat Hand-To-Hand Combat Credit Paramount Pictures Justin And Friends Justin And Friends Credit Paramount Pictures On our way to see the concert documentary Justin Bieber Never Say Never my not-yet-13-year-old-daughter asked ""Dad do you think theyd mind if during the movie I screamed?"" I said I thought the studio would be thrilled if she screamed. Shed prove she was a Biebermaniac a Belieber. The film as it happens is packed with little girls screaming -- and moaning and weeping. Id have screamed if I was in marketing because this is one awesome piece of packaging. The key of course is that Justin Bieber is presented as a grass-roots phenomenon someone who rose without corporate packaging. Never Say Never opens with a computer screen and a mouse clicking on well-known YouTube viral videos laughing babies cute dogs and so on. Then theres a YouTube video of little Justin in a paneled room a small-town kid with a big-city voice. ""Hey check out this kid"" reads a fake but representative e-mail. Bieber is were told the first social-network superstar. The movie is cunningly woven to show the tension between his insane success and his determination to remain a sane normal 16-year-old. His background helps. His teenage mom and dad split when he was 10 months old -- but were told he always had the love of his mother and her parents not to mention God and Jesus. He wasnt hatched in a studio incubator. His talent manager Scott ""Scooter"" Braun first saw him on YouTube. He couldnt interest record companies though because Bieber didnt have the requisite connection to Disney or Nickelodeon. So Braun enlisted Usher whom Bieber idolized. But in the end says Braun Bieber sold himself. Director Jon M. Chu jumps back and forth between Biebers rise and the countdown to his sold-out concert at Madison Square Garden -- the ""pinnacle"" the movie says as it counts down ""Ten Days to Madison Square Garden"" ""Nine Days to Madison Square Garden."" i Justins mother Pattie Mallette helps keep the young teen idol in line. Paramount Pictures hide caption toggle caption Paramount Pictures Justins mother Pattie Mallette helps keep the young teen idol in line. Paramount Pictures Since Bieber is already playing to sold-out arenas theres little in the way of suspense -- until he starts to lose his voice and has to cancel a show in Syracuse. A doctor arrives; theres a close-up of Justins inflamed tonsils. Will he be able to play the Garden? You gotta Beliebe. Unlike most packaged teen idols Bieber has a voice that needs no help from sound mixers and home movies show he had uncannily slick moves from an early age. Having risen out of the social network he has more communication tools at his disposal than say Donny Osmond in his day. In the middle of his song ""Baby"" he raps ""Yeah Im 16 and I thought that youd be mine / I used to tweet you and text you and call you and hit you on Facebook all the time. ... Cant believe that you did me wrong / We were on iChat all night long."" Wow iChatting all night long ... that is serious. No wonder one fan gushes ""I think about him like 99 percent of my life."" Another says ""One day I tweeted him 100 times."" ""Hes really hot"" adds a child who looks closer in years to diapers than puberty. In concert one girl is always pulled from her seat to sit on a stool onstage during his signature number ""One Less Lonely Girl."" As the girl here weeps and weeps as Bieber descends on her with a bouquet of flowers I checked out my daughter and her friend -- both rapt both crying. I find him such a white and pious and profoundly unthreatening little Furby robot of a pop star but little girls celebrity crushes are not to be trifled with. And this expertly engineered promo film makes Justin Bieber look like a force of nature.

Every on-screen drink in Mad Men in 5 minutes See the Dancing stars most memorable moves Emmys biggest snubs? Cranston Hamm more Toy Story toys burn up in prank on mom That includes an unusually effective use of 3-D from director Jon M. Chu (""Step Up 3D"") so get ready for plenty of shots of Bieber looking longingly into the camera reaching out to grab your hand while singing one of his infectious pop tunes. (And parents get ready for temporary hearing loss.) Quick facts Starring Justin Bieber Director Jon M. Chu Run time 1 hour 45 minutes MPAA rating G Bieber would be an easy target for anyone whos graduated from junior high school Hes 16 smooth and pretty with an androgynous look that recalls Hilary Swank in ""Boys Dont Cry"" and a playful non-threatening way about him. And that hair ... that famous mane that flips back and forth and always lands just right in a soft feathered swoop. (What he wears on top of his head -- an ever-present New York Yankees cap in his favorite color purple -- is more troubling. Given his ubiquity and influence he could be molding an entire generation of unsuspecting young Yankee fans. And that would be bad.) Video Watch the Justin Bieber Never Say Never trailer (on this page) But as Chus film reveals through home movies from Biebers small Canadian town of Stratford Ontario early YouTube clips and interviews with the people who discovered him hes preternaturally gifted freakishly poised and incessantly hardworking. From the sense of rhythm he displayed at age 2 to his confident busking outside a theater at age 12 to the chutzpah he showed in approaching his eventual mentor Usher and offering to sing for him just a couple years ago Bieber has always seemed fearless yet somehow grounded. He couldnt be more contemporary having built a grass-roots support system through social networks and yet he has that old-fashioned thing called moxie. And he genuinely seems like a good kid -- its hard not to like him. Video Bieber talks success changing voice hair (on this page) Sure ""Never Say Never"" plays like an extended infomercial for Bieber similar to recent 3-D movies about Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Bros. We get no sense of who Bieber really is whether he has any fears if he gets sick of touring and misses normal-kid stuff what he thinks about the hordes of girls who tremble and flail at the very mention of his name. But along those lines Chu does an excellent job of conveying the incomparable thrill of being young and bursting with love for your first idol crush; the footage of girls sobbing and hugging actually gets repetitive and ""Never Say Never"" probably could have been about 15 minutes shorter. But whether you grew up worshipping Paul McCartney or Shaun Cassidy Michael Jackson or Justin Timberlake youll relate. More Entertainment stories Autistic ballerina dances her way into hearts In a popular YouTube video the beaming little ballerina dances an entire four-minute routine seemingly perfectly matchin... Every on-screen drink in Mad Men in 5 minutes See the Dancing stars most memorable moves Emmys biggest snubs? Cranston Hamm more Toy Story toys burn up in prank on mom And Bieber -- who may or may not have had any actual romantic contact with a girl ever as far as this film is concerned -- at least knows how to make the girls feel special when mingling among them. During a particular song at each concert members of his ""team"" pluck one lucky gal from the audience to sit on stage and receive roses and a special serenade. Whether or not he knows what hes doing hes at least faking it well. Performance is at the heart of ""Never Say Never"" -- the title of one of Biebers songs -- with Chu tracing the days leading up to his Madison Square Garden concert which sold out in 22 minutes. Handlers -- including his devoutly Christian single mom stylist manager voice coach and bodyguard -- surround and guide him every step of the way which provides some hope that he will make the transition to adulthood with more discipline and grace than other teen celebrities who shall remain nameless. The sole source of tension Will his strained vocal cords hold up for the big night? When youre as dreamy and magical as Justin Bieber and everythings going your way theres really no doubt. So you may as well just sit back and enjoy the show. (c) 2012 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed.

Photo Anyone whos even vaguely aware of this 16-year-olds unlikely rise to musical superstardom isnt going to learn anything new from ""Justin Bieber Never Say Never"" an interminable documentary punctuated by perhaps half an hour of heavily edited 3-D performance footage. Just in case youve been living under a rock heres the story The child of a teenage single mother in Stratford Ontario is a mediocre soccer player in school who captivates audiences as a preteen street magician. His mother puts videos up on YouTube where hes ""discovered"" at age 12 by Scooter Braun -- as his camera-hogging manager reminds us roughly every 30 seconds. PHOTOS JUSTIN BIEBER Scooter introduces Justin to his musical mentor Usher. The androgynous teenager becomes a social-networking phenomenon drawing successively larger crowds as he tours North Americas radio stations and shopping malls charming one and all. Besides much redundant archival footage there are what appear to be carefully staged scenes of this ""regular"" kid (who does dozens of concert dates a year) hanging with his Canadian buddies and his ""extended dysfunctional family"" backstage. There are fleeting glimpses of Justins father and Justin looking at school books. But theres virtually no sense of what this scrawny teen (shown bare-chested several times) is actually like as a person (he smiles a lot) or what kind of life he really lives. Instead we see endless montages of Justin and Scooter distributing complimentary tickets to fans. The film slowly builds up to Justins first appearance at Madison Square Garden where his show sold out in 22 minutes. He pouts briefly for the camera when a cold forces the cancellation of an earlier stop on the tour. But everything is OK on the big night after fans tweet their get-well wishes. Its easy for a grown-up to be cynical about ""Justin Bieber Never Say Never"" which amounts to a G-rated infomercial for the Bieber brand. Tween fans priced out of his shows will likely be more than thrilled with the unremarkable performance footage (with guest artists like Miley Cyrus) supervised by director Jon M. Chu (""Step Up 3D""). Not to mention a montage of Justin flipping his trademark locks. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Survivor boss not sure if Hantz leaked spoilers Read Next Survivor boss not sure if Hantz leaked spoilers Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 34292 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 22910 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 17720 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

James Adams The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 11 2011 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 241PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Any adult who has had teenage children is going to find watching Justin Bieber Never Say Never a bittersweet experience. Equal parts biopic concert film and pep rally the movies 105 minutes do a good job of conveying the pleasures of pop courtesy of the very real talents of Justin Bieber who his 17th birthday just weeks away has gone baby gone from relative obscurity in Stratford Ont. to global ubiquity in less than two years becoming a Twitter-driven teen tycoon en route. Movies Never Say Never The official trailer video Justin Bieber walks red carpet in L.A. For Bieber believers the films a celebration of YouTubed youth of living in an ecstatic moment that seems like forever a moment the whole world even Jay Leno seems to be watching and enjoying. Its about the audiences joy of being one drop of water among many in a great swell of feeling. In short its an evocation of pop manias past - big ones (Sinatra Elvis the Beatles Michael Jackson) and not-so-big (David Cassidy Bay City Rollers New Kids on the Block Ricky Martin the Jonas Brothers). Thats the sweet spot. And believe me the hundreds of (mostly) singing screaming swooning girls with whom I saw Never Say Never the other evening were very much in the spot. Maddie a 12-year-old who sat next to me singing along to such hits as One Time and U Smile while waving a glo-stick throughout told me afterward that she thought the film was ""really good"" and shed ""definitely"" be seeing it again and buying the DVD ""for sure"" when its released. My 16-year-old son by contrast claims like many males his age to have no time for such idolatry. When told Id be reviewing Never Say Never he groaned and declared ""If you dont give it zero stars Ill be ashamed to call you my dad"" Later he said it would be okay if I gave it one star. The bitterness (if one can call it that) of the Bieber phenomenon is an adult thing - the realization that pop can be disorienting dangerous fun especially at its highest levels. Pop after all is what a fat soap bubble does after its flashed so prettily and briefly in a radiant sky. Pop is what happened to the King of Pop. Pop was the sound of Mark Chapmans pistol. Of course this cautionary side the pain and the poignancy is only touched upon in Never Say Never. Essentially director Jon Chu a man best known for the hip-hop dance film Step Up 2 The Streets offers a rehash of the myth of the Biebs the stuff weve already read about in Vanity Fair among many other places. Amazingly for a film that promises some up-close-and-personal time beyond the faux reach-outs afforded by the generally ineffectual 3-D effects theres not one real sit-down chat with the star. Instead we get a blizzard of baby pictures and videos which demonstrate that Justin was a very cute toddler a confident hambone from the get-go and the natural byproduct of what happens when the home video camera is always on. These images in turn are inter-cut with testimonials from Biebers Grade 7 teacher his soccer coach and his Stratford friends as well as from his voice trainer music director manager grandparents mother a teary-eyed dad (who split with Biebers mother when he was 10 months old) and of course the hair-stylist responsible for the famous flop. Biebers mop-top in fact provides the single best ""adult moment"" in the film when Chu fills the screen with Bieber swishing his tresses back and forth in slo-mo as Etta James (or Dinah Washington?) emotes At Last. Using concert footage from Biebers 2010 tour Chu tries to build suspense by arcing the film toward a climactic performance at New Yorks Madison Square Garden - what one Bieb handler helpfully describes as ""the pinnacle of success for an artist."" Mere days before the big show though Bieber blows his voice forcing the postponement of at least one gig. His mother meanwhile prays to the angels for ""complete healing."" Will the Biebs recover in time to take Manhattan? Hey the movies called Never Say Never for a reason. Near the films end Beibers manager Scooter Braun muses on how he wouldnt want to be the man to bet on Bieber not having a long career. History of course shows that Biebers chances are slim even though his abilities are superior to those of many previous teen dreams. The Beatles pulled a neat trick going from I Wanna Hold Your Hand to A Day in the Life in just three short years. They moved with the times and the times moved them and they moved the times. Its a feat Bieber will have to duplicate in a world far faster more competitive and with more distractions than that of the Beatles. Right now hes the sound and face of Now but tomorrow? Tomorrow never knows. Justin Bieber Never Say Never Directed by Jon M.

Starring Justin Bieber Miley Cyrus Jaden Smith Shawn Stockman Wanya Morris Nathan Morris Director Jon Chu Running time 145 Release Opened Feb 9 2011  Editorial Review Tweens get locks of loveBy David MalitzFriday February 11 2011Justin Bieber. To some people hes that young singer. You know the one with the hair. To others -- mostly tween girls -- he is the greatest singer in the history of music. The cutest boy who ever lived. And quite possibly the greatest person in the history of mankind. Ever. OMG. And dont you dare make fun of The Hair.""Never Say Never"" the new concert film/documentary starring the 16-year-old pop megastar has an easy task in winning over that latter segment. If the film consisted solely of the one scene in which a shirtless Bieber blow-dries his luscious locks that would be enough to convince them it is the greatest cinematic achievement since ""Citizen Kane."" (Whoever that is.) The bigger question is whether any folks who dont shriek at the mere mention of the Biebs name will leave the theater with a case of Bieber Fever.Answer Perhaps a mild case but nothing too serious. ""Never Say Never"" is sort of like the featured piece of a political nominating convention. Its a fluffy mildly inspiring celebration of the hero leading up to his big moment. In this case its not potential leadership of the free world but instead a concert at New Yorks Madison Square Garden that is seen as the culmination of a whirlwind couple of years that saw Bieber rise from Canadian YouTube sensation to international heartthrob. It plays to the base and if it wins over a few newbies all the better.Although director Jon Chu tries to paint Bieber as a sort of underdog throughout the movie whats remarkable is actually how smooth the journey to success was. His gift for music was clear from an early age and there is plenty of video footage to prove it. Baby Bieber (adorable obviously) bangs bongos moves on to a full drum kit eventually picks up guitar and finally develops that sugary voice. There he is busking on the streets of Ontario competing in local talent shows -- always with a camera trained on him. Sometimes it feels like the movie has been in the works for his entire life. (Which really it has.) In fact when manager Scooter Braun tells of Biebers first meeting with eventual mentor Usher when an excitable Bieber pestered him with questions after Braun specifically told him not to it feels weird that we just hear about this and dont actually get to see it. Thats rectified a few minutes later when we see footage of Biebers initial audition of sorts for Usher. Biebers story is almost like a true life manifestation of ""The Truman Show"" where we see every move he makes.Braun is the brains behind Biebers success the man who devoted himself to making a star of the kid after first seeing some videos on YouTube. Its his voice we hear more than any other than Biebers and hes in charge of the massive crew that has become Biebers extended family. Fittingly its Braun who gets the final hug -- second only to Biebers own mother Pattie Malette -- after the triumphant MSG performance.Bieber himself comes off like well a 16-year-old kid. A bit goofy a bit cocky and really into his hair. There are plenty of attempts to showcase him as just a regular kid -- eating pizza with his friends back home being told to clean his room brushing his teeth -- but its clear he had stardom on his mind from the time he knew what stardom was.As well he should have. That mindset is what helps him shine during the musical segments. Bieber seems most comfortable when there are 20000 eyes and cameras focused on him not just the one following him around backstage. His voice is undeniably charming his stage presence self-assured and his songs almost always catchy. Dismiss him as the latest teen sensation if you will but his sprightly Ramp;B-based pop songs are more Jackson 5 than New Kids on the Block.Will the squealing teenage girls the ones who profess unending love during preconcert interviews and openly weep when he sings and gyrates onstage stand by him even when his voice changes and a new sensation comes along with an even cooler haircut? Its hard to say. But they will almost certainly stand up and sing along during the closing performance of ""Baby"" and thats the point of ""Never Say Never.""Audience may contain shrieking girls.

Photo Chad Ziemendorf The Chronicle Justin Bieber Never Say Never review Never 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Justin Bieber Never Say Never Documentary. Starring Justin Bieber Scooter Braun Miley Cyrus and Jaden Smith. Directed by Jon Chu. (G. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Justin Bieber loves his grandfather. He studies chemistry on the tour bus gives tickets to fans who couldnt get into the show and visits a girl playing violin at the same outdoor spot where he used to sing for cash - offering her words of encouragement. Its a disappointment to see the teen pop star hop in a tour bus. This is a boy who should be traveling across rainbows on the back of a unicorn. Is Justin Bieber the new prophet? ""Justin Bieber Never Say Never"" doesnt directly answer this question (or technically pose it) but the answer is obvious based on fan enthusiasm. The audience of mostly preteen girls at our screening screamed hysterically during the pre-movie prompt that tells people to put on their 3-D glasses. Is this a good movie? Thats a tougher question. Young fans will lose their minds although that would have happened if the film consisted of an hour and 45 minutes of Bieber brushing his teeth. Adult chaperones who care nothing of the stars music will find the film surprisingly tolerable. Everyone else should proceed with caution. Related Stories Justin Bieber Never Say Never Three of the four people who get the most camera time are ""Never Say Never"" producers so we knew this wasnt going to be an expose. They fiercely protect the brand to the point that Bieber often comes off as a smiling impish perfectly coiffed cipher. Video from his pre-fame childhood reveals more than recent footage. How will Bieber who turns 17 in a couple of weeks avoid becoming the next Leif Garrett? Come up with your own answer because Team Bieber isnt going to explore the question. Director Jon Chu does sneak some vegetables in with the Bieber-mania offering an interesting account of how Biebers manager bypassed industry rules and used social networking to accomplish in one year what would normally take eight. Bieber looks conveniently heroic when a show is canceled but the accompanying explanation of vocal cord strain borders on educational. And the frequent interviews with squealing Bieber fans are very entertaining. Whats that 11-year-old girls? You were nodding off during the previous two paragraphs? Then lets get down to the information you want to know. Heres ""Justin Bieber Never Say Never"" by the numbers ... -- Bieber points toward the audience in 3-D five times. -- Takes his shirt off six. -- Shaves his face completely unnecessarily one. One more thing about this film. The 3-D is a rip-off. Most of the movie appears to be shot in 2-D with several three-dimensional scenes weaved in from a Madison Square Garden concert. But then again when Bieber flips his feathered hair his aura of wonderfulness is projected to the world in 6-D. So just be glad you dont have to pay triple the regular price. -- Advisory This film contains scenes of shirtless Bieber including one where he blow-dries his hair. He also eats a doughnut out of a garbage can.

By Paramount Pictures Super co-stars Usher is among the big names singing with Justin Bieber. EnlargeClose By Paramount Pictures Super co-stars Usher is among the big names singing with Justin Bieber. Unless youre a 10-year-old girl and are said fan in which case you might find there to be too much talking and not enough baby baby baby. Such is the quandary for the 16-year-old crooner and his shiny happy 3-D concert film To continue courting the prepubescents who made him an international star or woo the older fans who will likely sustain him. PHOTOS Lots of Justin Bieber shots Bieber and director Jon M. Chu choose the former as Never remains as wispy as his ballads. While the film makes clear Bieber is a wunderkind who wants to be seen more as a Justin Timberlake than a Rick Astley his movie retreats from anything near the portrait that Michael Jacksons This Is It posthumously became. Thats a shame because there was drama in Biebers life. He grew up poor to a single mom in Ontario Canada and became a sensation only after posting his second-place finish in a singing competition on YouTube. Never though touches only briefly on that childhood. And though Bieber taught himself to play several instruments the film whisks past his talents to get to his bangs -- and does nothing to risk Nevers G-rating. Justin Bieber Never Say Never   out of four Stars Justin Bieber Miley Cyrus Jaden Smith Director Jon M. Chu Distributor Paramount Pictures Rating G Running time 1 hour 45 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Still Never works as a gum-snapper concert movie and does provide a glimpse into instant stardom in the Twitter generation. Cameos by Jaden Smith and Miley Cyrus serve as humorous reminders that Hollywood is populated by lottery winners. The movie too knows its fan base from gap-toothed girls to the moms who know his moves a little too well. His high-topped feet and liquid locks play almost too well in 3-D Fans heads blocking your view arent in the theater theyre on screen. That Never doesnt work as a biopic isnt a surprise. Biebers too young to paint a picture with much context. As loud as Transformers and as happy as a Teletubby Never is as drama-free as the songs it belts.

By Carrie Rickey Inquirer Movie CriticPosted February 11 2011Make a C with your left hand make a backward C with your right; put them together and point thumbs south.If Never Say Never is an accurate thermometer then Bieber Fever - the pubescent-female passion for popster Justin Bieber - is North Americas happiest epidemic.From Biebers modest beginnings in Stratford Ontario almost 17 years ago to his Madison Square Garden concert last August that sold out in 22 minutes Never Say Never is one part backstage biography one part concert film charting the roots and meteoric rise of Justin II successor to that supernova surnamed Timberlake.Bypassing the Disney and Nickelodeon machines that reliably mold disposable teen sensations Bieber got attention via YouTube videos of him singing Chris Brown tunes.One of these DIY videos caught the eye of Atlanta-based entrepreneur Scooter Braun. Braun introduced him to Ramp;B star Usher and to producer L.A. Reid who shrewdly assesses Bieber as ""the Macaulay Culkin of music."" (Bieber shares with child stars Culkin and Leonardo DiCaprio those tousled blond locks and that rosebud mouth.)What the 3-D film lacks in cinematic charm and ingenuity is compensated for by its subjects high-wattage charisma and low-key earnestness. This is not A Hard Days Night even if Bieber has a Beatles haircut and shakes windswept locks like puppy emerging from tub.Replete with home movies of Baby Justin banging drums kindergartner thwacking T-ball and preteen strumming an oversize guitar Jon Chus film bounces to the Tiger Beat. Bieber fans describe their crush object in words like adorable.Chu who directed Step Up 3 has fun with the 3-D effects here most of which involve JB pointing his finger at the audience creating the illusion that he is pointing directly at you. (Cue high-pitched shrieks.)In scene after scene we see that the hardest-working 16-year-old in show business is still an ordinary kid who likes pizza and shooting hoops and still has to hit the books (hes tutored on the road). Bieber is buoyed by what his voice coach ""Mama Jan"" calls a ""functional dysfunctional family"" costumers and cheerleaders and dance coaches who help him make good choices e.g. canceling a performance when his vocal cords are inflamed.But the movie also acknowledges the 100-hour workweeks of this overnight sensation who made appearances at high schools and radio stations across the country to build his fan base and endear himself to disc jockeys. On stage variously with Boyz II Men Jaden Smith Miley Cyrus and Ludacris Bieber carries himself like a squeaky-clean homeboy with an angelic voice. On him swagger looks sweet.Still Braun and Biebers mother Pattie Mallette worry about the teenagers intense professionalism. Braun recalls the Video Music Awards in 2009 at which Madonna eulogized Michael Jackson saying ""He never had a childhood.""""Dont let that happen to me"" Bieber said to his father surrogate. Amen.Justin Bieber Never Say Never  (out of four stars)Directed by Jon Chu.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Consider it a new kind of chick flick or a pretty spectacular 3-D infomercial. That depends how supportive -- or cynical -- you are about teen/tween pop. Either way ""Justin Bieber Never Say Never"" is a sweetly entertaining canny celebration of the pop heartthrob du jour. The nearly two-hour film is a smartly choreographed documentary about the Canadian idol that tugs at young girls hearts with 3-D concert footage cuddly closeups of the Biebs offstage (including priceless childhood videos) and vicarious situations in which female fans get free concert tickets meet the Biebs or just scream. OMG This pop doc is much more flattering than any episode of ""VH1s Behind the Music."" At 16 Bieber probably doesnt have too many skeletons in his closest. He is portrayed as a hard-working grounded kid who makes time for his fans friends and family (who are very involved and concerned). No parent with a Bieber-loving daughter will walk away from this film thinking the sweet eminently likable Justin is going to want to grow up faster than Miley Cyrus. ""Never Say Never"" starts off the way Biebers career did -- YouTube videos. Then it creates an artificial story arc in which he has 10 days of concerts to get to the promised land New Yorks sold-out Madison Square Garden a high point of his meteoric career. The film paints Bieber as an underdog raised by a single teenage mom in Stratford Ontario (population 32000). Frequent interviews with his manager Scooter Braun -- a Svengali for the digital era who discovered him on YouTube and filmed every step of their courtship and partnership -- emphasize the underdog notion at every turn. His drive is more forceful than Biebers but the young singer and his omnipresent mom seem cognizant of what theyre getting into. JUSTIN BIEBER NEVER SAY NEVER  out of 4 stars Rated G The requisite dramatic tension arises when Bieber starts developing problems with his vocal cords during his 86-concert tour and a throat doctor and his touring vocal coach give him stern advice about shutting down and shutting up. (Its one of the few times in life that an authority figure encourages her charges to spend time texting and tweeting.) Too bad we dont see other adult-directed moments when he is rehearsing with the band learning dance steps or doing his schoolwork (there is a gratuitous fleeting shot of a pile of textbooks). Befitting a high-budget infomercial ""Never Say Never"" has a parade of guests onstage (Usher Boyz II Men Sean Kingston Jaden Smith Ludacris Miley Cyrus) and off (Kobe Bryant Snoop Dogg Michelle Obama Tina Fey Chelsea Handler Drake). But mostly its about the magic of the Biebs -- the catchy bubblegum music cute face and that helmet hair.

(Paramount) Elizabeth Weitzman DAILY NEWS FILM CRITIC Thursday February 10 2011 400 AM Title Its common for Justin Biebers team to talk about how unique his story is how theres never been anyone like him and probably never will be again. And maybe thats true if you happen to be a 12-year-old girl in 2011.If youre the chaperone whos been pulled along to ""Justin Bieber Never Say Never"" however youd be forgiven for thinking his movie looks just like say 2009s ""Jonas Brothers The 3D Concert Experience"" or Miley Cyrus ""Best of Both Worlds Concert"" before that. But this is not a place for cynicism. Biebers world -- at least as edited for mass consumption -- is a refreshingly wholesome universe where a young superstar is good-natured and grateful says grace before every meal and spends all his free time on the tour bus tweeting. He also likes to hug a lot.In other words hes the perfect first crush and this is the perfect movie for someone currently experiencing that crush. ""Never Say Never"" recounts the history fans undoubtedly know by heart starting off with baby pictures and home videos showing a talented kid who eventually becomes a YouTube sensation before facing his first night at Madison Square Garden. Most of the movie leads up to and includes that 2010 show packing in guests like Cyrus Usher and Jaden Smith along with two dozen songs from the swoonworthy ""One Less Lonely Girl"" to the undeniably hooky ""Baby."" Plus we get to watch Bieber shake his hair in 3D.Any adult could guess that this upbeat carefully-packaged promotional tool - slickly directed by ""Step Up"" veteran Jon Chu - was produced by Biebers management. But all tweens will see is their front-row seat to the Best. Concert. Ever. At least until their new crush comes along next year.

Share Tweet Never Say Never a concert documentary following the rise of Justin Bieber from YouTube hit to Madison Square Garden headliner is essentially a propaganda film indoctrinating teens and skeptical parents into the Bieber Army one adorable baby photo and pandering fan montage at a time. Occasionally its almost convincing For a 16-year-old Bieber is surprisingly charismatic and the film does an admirable job of portraying the pure distilled joy of teenagers in the presence of their idol without resorting to mockery. However the films premise--that Bieber achieved his superstardom through years of hard work overcoming towering obstacles--is so ludicrously flawed that everything built upon it borders on self-parody. As if Never Say Nevers ""reach for the stars"" narrative wasnt telegraphed loudly enough by its title it becomes deafeningly clear in the first 10 minutes which intercuts home-video footage of Baby Bieber singing and banging on a tiny drum set with dynamic 3D footage of his sold-out MSG show. Interviews with Biebers mother manager vocal coach and dozens of ecstatic braces-wearing fans reiterate again and again how talented and hardworking and cute Bieber is and footage of him pulling his giant tour bus into his small Ontario hometown to spend a day hanging with his old friends and sleeping in his childhood bed is calibrated to achieve maximum ""awwww."" Its the sort of sanctification that should be familiar to anyone whos lived through a teen-idol supremacy but it crosses into parody when discussion turns toward Biebers discovery by manager Scooter Braun in 2008. Braun characterizes his nurturing of Biebers career as a major gamble and his proteges success as a grassroots movement succeeding outside the Disney/Nickelodeon machine--never mind that Bieber had the combined powers of Ramp;B star Usher and record impresario Antonio ""L.A."" Reid backing his career. A few months spent doing radio-station gigs is represented as the height of road-warrior determination and Biebers (admittedly endearing) interactions with fans in person and on Twitter are depicted as saintly acts of graciousness. Theres nothing wrong with achieving fame quickly but portraying an 18-month career as a long arduous struggle for success is laughable and borderline-offensive. Although hes in nearly every frame Bieber is an elusive figure in the movie He happily mugs for the camera notably in a hilarious moment where he flips his signature hair-swoop in glorious slow-motion 3D to the strains of Etta James ""At Last."" But he never engages with it leaving his various handlers to craft his legend. Passing mention is given to the alienation and pressure inherent in teen-idoldom but it comes via an interview with Miley Cyrus and quickly segues into glossy footage of them dueting onstage. Theres no room for reflection when theres 3D concert footage to get to and director Jon Chu brings the same lively camerawork to the MSG performance as he did to the similarly pretty-but-vacant Step Up 3D. But like its 3D sequences Never Say Never has only the illusion of depth; beyond the shiny visuals and trumped-up origin story theres nothing but flat emptiness.

Bieber stands in front of the movies 3D camera and swings his bangs in slow motion while a robust romantic epiphany of Etta Jamess ""At Last plays around him.The choice is a show of sweet classy restraint since the more obviously appropriate song is the one Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smiths daughter Willow had a massive hit with in the spring ""Whip My Hair.Bieber has a Beatles bowl cut that swirls at a canted funhouse angle.

Hes become a ubiquitous part of the cultural oxygen which might make some people wish they were fish.The movie wants us to know that Bieber came from humble North American beginnings (in Ontario Canada) that he works hard that he lives for his fans that he can sing live. In that sense the film is packaged like recent concert extravaganzas about Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers.Yet the director John M. Chu has been permitted to present enough of the Bieber process and enterprise to be intriguing. Its a vaguely like the fascinating Michael Jackson performance documentary ""This Is It.The movie charts Biebers rather immediate ascendance from obscurity to Internet sensation to selling out Madison Square Garden in 22 minutes last year.It explains how he wound up under the auspices first of Usher then the producer and recording executive Antonio ""L.A. Reid. They say they saw something special in him and the film has lots of footage to suggest what that might have been a white tween male who could sing with reasonable soul.The argument here is that Bieber became famous in a new way through social media and YouTube. On Twitter he has well more than 7 million followers but in a rare act of social-media politesse he follows 107000 people. Taylor Swift has 5 million followers and follows 49 which is about normal for celebrities. (Kanye West has more than 2 million followers and follows no one.) Who knows what this portends for his careers longevity. But he and his people do appear sincerely bonded to their fans.One of the movies many nice touches presents a swarm of clips in which Biebers fans sing ""One Time while he performs it live. The thousands of video frames become a wailing wall of adulation.But ""Bieber fever as the mania hes inspired is called also has a cultish tinge. During his shows he invites a concertgoer to sit on stage so he can serenade her with ""One Less Lonely Girl. Bieber turns 17 in a month but hes scarcely sexual. His dangerlessness is his appeal.But when he sings to a fellow teenager in a packed stadium hes no longer a pop star or not only a pop star. Hes a televangelist pretending to heal the lame.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. Twitter wesley_morris. (c) Copyright 2011 Globe Newspaper Company.

Credit Paramount Pictures Jon M. Chus ""Justin Bieber Never Say Never"" is billed as a concert documentary but fewer than half of its 105 minutes are devoted to Mr. Bieber onstage. That was the right choice because hes more engaging as a star than hes ever likely to be as a performer.You dont necessarily want to talk about sex when discussing someone whose fans are mostly adolescent girls but Justin Bieber is nothing if not an old-fashioned carefully constructed sex symbol somewhere between a more knowing Donny Osmond and a less insinuating Elvis Presley. When the little girls understand you music and personality are beside the point.Mr. Chu is certainly aware of this given the close-up attention he lavishes on the priceless combination of eyes hair and jawline of smile vocal timbre and self-confidence that have carried the waifish -- but fit -- Mr. Bieber to pop-culture Valhalla.And while ""Never Say Never"" is an approved biography and marketing tool in which the 16-year-old Mr. Bieber showcases his winsomeness and humility alongside his modest talents as a singer and dancer Mr. Chu recognizes that the most compelling visual in this story is all those screaming girls.So he points the camera 180 degrees away from the star a fair bit of the time and that view introduces a queasy note of apprehension into the otherwise wholesome picture. Occasionally you see a fan whose senses are particularly deranged by her love for Mr. Bieber and you hope that his security team has her picture on file. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Chu who has experience in both 3-D filmmaking and stage spectacles (he directed the ""Step Up"" sequels) toes the company line the rest of the time splicing together home movies from Mr. Biebers prefame years and shooting numerous boring segments with his handlers and coaches. It should be noted that the films producers include Mr. Bieber and his manager Scooter Braun a 29-year-old whose inflections and intensity recall the young Rob Morrow.The concert scenes are perfunctory shot in the usual manner with the 3-D cameras gliding back and forth at knee level. A duet between Mr. Bieber and Miley Cyrus just 16 months older serves as a cautionary example of how quickly a child star can begin to look middle aged and irrelevant. Several appearances with Usher on the other hand demonstrate what it means to own the stage. Next to Usher his mentor Mr. Bieber just fades away.In the films best and weirdest shot Mr. Chu zooms in close as Mr. Bieber flings his head back and forth in slow motion waving his famously floppy hair in a moment thats both hilarious and creepy especially when youre watching in 3-D.At 70 or 80 minutes reduced to crazy fans backstage atmosphere and home-movie footage of Mr. Bieber playing hockey and pounding the drums ""Never Say Never"" could have been entirely satisfying. At 105 minutes its exhausting even though it has been expertly cut together.Mr. Bieber is amiable company but on screen at least he also projects the opacity of the single-minded and self-assured -- the quality that along with good looks and competent management makes him such an ideal repository for other peoples dreams. Everyone involved in ""Never Say Never"" is working overtime to prove that he is as one of them puts it ""just a regular kid who had a dream"" while everything about the movie screams the opposite.JUSTIN BIEBER NEVER SAY NEVEROpens on Friday nationwide.

"Movie review Justin Bieber Never Say Never - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Justin BieberMovie review Justin Bieber Never Say NeverStructure mars the documentary about the young singer but his fans wont care.February 11 2011|By Mark Olsen Special to the Los Angeles Times Justin Bieber in a scene from ""Never Say Never."" (Paramount Pictures )""Justin Bieber Never Say Never"" is part concert film part brand consolidation something designed to function as both an introduction for the uninitiated to this pop music singing-and-dancing sensation and a keepsake totem for his ravenous heavy-spending fans. This division of intent never quite coheres as the momentum of the concert sequences is broken up by lots of back story on his unlikely meteoric rise and the concert audio is mixed so that the shrieking of Biebers audience often overwhelms the music. Though there is something teasingly contemporary about Bieber and his omni-bangs a YouTube and Twitter play a big role in his origin story a there is also an undercurrent of plucky old-fashioned showbiz in the way his career is being handled measured in record sales and concert tickets. For all the new-media trappings Biebers success was initially pushed forward by what his manager Scooter Braun refers to as the ""hand-to-hand combat"" of winning over one radio station at a time. Strictly as a piece of filmmaking ""Never Say Never"" is a bit of a mess. Director Jon M. Chu creates an early structuring device of counting down the days to Biebers sold-out concert at Madison Square Garden but then often lets that drive drop in particular during a long biographical middle section. Additionally the main concert footage used throughout the film is from that show at the Garden so building up to something at the same time its being shown really drains the drama from the moment. Bieber is a mix of intuitive performer and apparent quick study. As a dancer his style is endearingly awkward as if the 16-year-old still has not quite figured out how his body works. When he reaches out to touch Miley Cyrus during an onstage duet a eliciting squeals of delight from the crowd a it is a move of practiced stagecraft not an expression of emotion. Yet beneath his polish there is still something unpracticed and a bit goofy to Bieber and his ever-present team of handlers. When a random girl is plucked night after night from the audience for him to serenade onstage he hands her a big bouquet of roses; as he sings a solo acoustic number he hangs over the crowd seated in a giant heart. Bieber seems to sit at some rare intersection of the newfangled and the traditional where camera phones coexist sweetly with swooning romance. In the films most disarming moment Bieber stops in front of a young girl playing the violin on the street in his hometown. She asks if hes Justin Bieber and he tells her he used to play guitar in that very same spot. The look of affection surprise and swelling pride on her face shows his odd ability to make his Follow Your Dream narrative transcend its greeting-card corniness into something almost believable. Or perhaps that should be Beliebable. calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESIn Justin Biebers Believe Jon Chu aims to look beyond...December 24 2013Justin Bieber booed at Billboard Awards says hes no...May 20 2013Justin Bieber gets love from One Direction after London woesMarch 12 2013Justin Bieber collapses at London concert returns to...March 7 2013Manager Scooter Braun lets loose over Justin Biebers...December 6 2012MORE STORIES ABOUTJustin BieberNot_live_webEntertainmentConcertCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-justin-bieber-20110211,0,1994905.story",200,justinbieberneversaynever21,justinbieberneversaynever,latimes

"Justin Bieber Never Say Never Dont stop Belieb-ing | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentJustin Bieber Never Say Never Dont stop Belieb-ingAnyone who wonders how Justin Bieber went from YouTube curiosity to arena-filling sensation in the space of roughly two years will find plenty to sigh over in Never Say Never.Justin Bieber Never Say Never opens Friday with an up-close look at the pint-sized pop star.  (HANDOUT)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticWed. Feb. 9 2011Justin Bieber Never Say Never (out of 4)Starring Justin Bieber and his family friends and fans. Directed by Jon Chu. At major theatres. 105 minutes. GYou wouldnt want to go to Justin Bieber Never Say Never expecting anything terribly novel even with the dubious adornment of 3-D.Been there done that with teen idols and their quickie cinema cash-ins at least as far back as Elvis and most recently in the third dimension with Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Bros.Article Continued BelowNo circular device is being reinvented here by the Canuck pop wunderkind and his vast entourage of Svengalis.But darned if Bieber and director Jon Chu (from the Step Up dance film franchise) dont come up with something original anyway the cheesiest stunt yet for a poppers insta-pic the camera travelling up Biebers throat to show the strained vocal chords that threaten his Madison Square Garden debut last fall.The TonsilCam shot is an attempt to inject some drama into the rote behind-the-screams chronicle of 16-year-old Biebers transformation from a precocious kid from Stratford Ont. kid into a precocious kid from Stratford Ont. who now sells millions of albums fills major arenas and is reportedly worth 100 million.The skinny kid with the hair like a flash-frozen tsunami now ranks somewhere between the fifth Beatle and the fourth Chipmunk if breathless reports are to be believed. And anyone who wonders how he achieved this feat in the space of roughly two years will find plenty to sigh over in Never Say Never.The film makes full use of the gadget-driven narcissism Bieber was born into in 1994 significantly the same year the Internet first cracked the public consciousness.Despite his hard-luck beginnings as the son of a teen mom in a broken home young Justin lived like a low-rent version of Jim Carreys video-fetishized Truman Burbank from The Truman Show. Seemingly every moment of Biebers life was caught on camera allowing Chu to show the skyrocket in full flight from the lads earliest living-room performances to his Stratford street busking to his fortuitous YouTube warblings that grabbed the attention of Scooter Braun the U.S. talent scout who now manages Bieber like a 21st-century Col. Tom Parker.This cache of grainy home videos and family/friend/teacher testimonials which 3-D does nothing to improve serves to silence any non-Beliebers who doubt Justins musical abilities. He possesses ample chops including surprisingly good drumming skills all displayed without a hint of shyness -- or humility for that matter.Theres a generous selection of performances of such tween-touching hits as ""Baby"" ""Smile"" and ""One Less Lonely Girl"" the latter performed on stage as a love croon to a flower-bedecked girl plucked from the concert audience.And check out that fan base which includes not just delirious schoolgirls (""Hes cute hes awesome I just love him so much"" one coos to camera) but also a squad of earlier pop sensations coming down from their own sugar highs at various rates of deflation. Its instructive and also fascinating to watch the likes of Miley Cyrus Boyz II Men Usher Ludacris and Jaden Smith (identified as a ""karate expert"") all bum-rushing Biebers stage hoping to borrow some of that lightning he still has in his bottle. Smiths preening is positively vampiric since hes an actor and not a concert performer and his inexperience and crass opportunism really show. Just last summer he was living large as the star of The Karate Kid remake; does success now have a shelf life shorter than Wonder Bread?What Bieber has in greater abundance than anything or anyone is sheer determination. Watching him plow through an 86-show tour and numerous other celebrity duties all while preparing for his omigod MSG debut suggest hed literally walk through walls if it would benefit his career.Were told that he has performed with a broken foot with strep throat and in the middle of a rainstorm before 40 soaked fans. Not all at the same time thankfully but such stoicism makes the hammy theatrics with the TonsilCam and the fretting over his New York gig seem just a tad on the suspicious side. You dont know whether to damn Bieber and Chu for manipulating our emotions or praise them for trying to put some essence into this effervescence.""Everything relies on two little strips of fiber in his throat"" cautions Jan ""Mama Jan"" Smith Biebers vocal coach and 24/7 nag. With all due props to Mama the Justin Bieber phenomenon is about way more than the singing. Its about believing in yourself and never giving up until that last cash register ka-chings -- really Mama havent you been paying attention?Read more about Justin BieberThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Daily Edition Login to download FILM REVIEW Justin Bieber Never Say Never an Engaging Musical Portrait 1144 PM PST 2/8/2011 by Michael Rechtshaffen FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Paramount Pictures An undeniably engaging musical portrait that delivers major bangs for the buck. TWITTER The teen pop sensation will likely make believers out of all but the most hardened of skeptics with this 3D doc from ""Step Up 3D"" director Jon Chu. Setting out to demonstrate that overnight sensations deserve respect too Justin Bieber should make believers out of all but the most hardened of skeptics with Justin Bieber Never Say Never. An energetic portrait of the global superstar as a down-to-earth teen from small-town Canada the documentary works overtime (by about 10 minutes too long) to change his perception from fluke Internet phenom to the hardest working 16-year-old on the planet. And it generally succeeds too thanks to a visually energetic approach by director Jon Chu that keeps all the obligatory backstage/onstage bits moving fluidly. In a business where timing is everything the Paramount release is perfectly positioned for maximum impact especially considering an ambitious media blitz that saw Bieber extending his demographic reach with appearances on The Daily Show and Late Show With David Letterman. Unlike say the 2009 Jonas Brothers 3D concert film which felt like it came out a couple of years too late Never Say Never is striking while the fevers still hot which should translate into more Miley-sized returns. RELATED Justin Bieber Hits Cover of Hollywood Reporter (and Debuts New Haircut) Starting off appropriately on a YouTube page where Bieber famously overtook the sneezing pandas and cute kitties singing a cover of Chris Browns With You the film follows the trajectory of its main mans career from behind his kiddie drum kit to the mighty Madison Square Garden stage which incidentally was sold out in a mere 22 minutes. Along the way we meet his young devout Christian single mom Pattie (who gave birth to The Bieb when she was all of 18) and his baby-faced manager Scooter Braun not to mention several of his more famous early adherents including Usher and prolific producer Antonio ""L.A."" Reid who in the remarkably self-possessed Bieber saw a musical Macaulay Culkin. Director Chu who infuses the film with the same lively zip he lent Step Up 3D (although here hes working with a more intriguing ""script"") keeps things disarmingly real for the most part and even manages to work in a little drama when it appears Biebers raggedy voice may not bounce back in time for the MSG gig. RELATED Hundreds of Fans Fill L.A. Live for Justin Bieber Never Say Never Premiere And much like in Chus previous film the 3D pops mainly in the performance sequences in which hes joined by the likes of Usher Cyrus Ludacris and Jaden Smith where all the fist-pumping dancing lasers and cascading ticker tape work to heightened effect. But where the film ultimately hits home is with the more intimate backstage stuff. Under the protective wing of an on-the-road support system serving as in the words of one of his crew a highly functional dysfunctional family Bieber manages to make his films inspirational message heard loud and clear Despite your preconceived notions hes just your average everyday multiplatinum-selling teen idol who still likes to kick back with his Stratford Ontario homies and grab a slice at the corner pizza joint.

Though anyone who needs convincing wont touch this one with a 10-foot pole ""Justin Bieber Never Say Never"" makes a persuasive case for its titular star as a far more talented-than-usual teen idol. As much a legitimate documentary as it is a 3D concert film and teen girl squeal-delivery device the film possesses surprising moments of candor on the toil of teenage superstardom even if the overall effect is purely promotional. Provided it skirts the curse of the Jonas Brothers (who released a similar film just as their popularity began to flatline) it should go over like gangbusters. While they ought to be distracted enough by the intimate interview footage (and almost creepily frequent shirtless sequences) of the Biebs on display fans expecting a straightforward concert pic will likely be confused by the early going. The film starts with what seems a sort of meta-commentary showing an onscreen email inbox opening up to YouTube clips of laughing babies and Failblog mishaps before finally reminding the audience of the singers roots singing in simple homemade viral clips. Indeed Bieber is perhaps the first fully social-media-bred pop star so its no surprise that he should be so easygoing with the film crew here alternately mugging for director Jon M. Chu and tolerating him as though he were an intrusive camera-wielding grandparent. From here pic intersperses half-song glimpses of Biebers headlining stint at Madison Square Garden last year with backstage footage and biographical info all chaptered by a rolling countdown to the show. Included is his childhood with a single teenage mother in small-town Canada the emergence of his precocious musical talent and his subsequent quasi-adoptions by both record-label svengali Scooter Braun and superstar mentor Usher. No doubt this kid can really sing and play some decent guitar and drums -- as homevideo of the artist as a (somewhat) younger man busking on street corners illustrates -- and hes often disconcertingly adult in his professional demeanor. Attempts to derive high narrative drama from Biebers nagging throat problems on the eve of the big gig are a bit ludicrous especially considering weve been watching selections from said concert throughout. But they do provide an interesting glimpse at the behind-the-scenes machinations of the whole enterprise. They also beg the big question of whether its healthy to consign a 16-year-old kid to a life of such pressures and a brief invocation of Michael Jacksons death makes one a bit apprehensive about whether the team in his corner has his best interests in mind. Pic eventually shows its heavier hand later on as Braun describes his rather self-aggrandizing habit of teasing ticketless fans outside concert venues before bequeathing them primo comped seats as ""giving back"" and the interviews with such fans who can recite Biebers birthday down to the minute and day of the week are a little alarming. But at other times the film (and by association its star) shows a healthy sense of humor about the Bieber Fever phenomenon including a hilarious slo-mo sequence of Bieber flipping his famous hair to the strains of Etta James ""At Last."" The 3D work is mostly applied to the concert itself which finally begins to take precedence with a Miley Cyrus duet and reaches a full-on giddy climax with the set-closing ""Baby"" the sole song in Biebers catalog thus far that seems destined for the archives. Other tech contributions including the filling-loosening sound mix are expertly handled. Justin Bieber Never Say NeverProductionA Paramount release and presentation of a Scooter Braun Films and L.A.

From the Monkees to Miley Cyrus it has been packaged and promoted like candy to a baby. Its performers are often little more than blow-dried puppets with angel faces. Yet most of us deep down know that even with an army of adults pulling the strings teen pop can on occasion be great -- an authentic explosion of bubblegum passion. Just think of the Monkees best songs or the sublime swoon of the Backstreet Boys ""I Want It That Way"" or Hansons ""MMMBop"" which spent a year as the most infectious sound on the airwaves. Justin Bieber Never Say Never may be the concert film as glorified promotional product but it captures a genuine youthquake. At 16 years old Bieber is small-boned and loose-limbed with the face of an androgynous cherub those goo-goo eyes that ridiculously overripe grin and windswept helmet of hair which combine to give him the look of Hilary Swank as a junior-high jock. That mane has some of the effect that the Beatles moptops did It invites tween girls in the audience to view him as both the other and as a mirror of themselves. No wonder they start squealing. In Never Say Never Bieber at Madison Square Garden bops and gyrates without any special virtuosity but hes got something that a lot of better dancers dont He communicates joy in every move. Hes also got the voice of a happy canary and when he does a song like ""U Smile"" with its lilting back-and-forth beat and tasty harmonic conversions he turns the simple gorgeous chorus (""You smile I smile"") into a house-swaying epiphany. Never Say Never is a concert movie intercut with what might be a full-scale Behind the Music episode. Its jam-packed with home videos and audition tapes (theres an astonishing clip of Bieber at 12 crooning like Michael Jackson outside the Avon Theatre in his hometown of Stratford Ontario) plus interviews with his friends family members gofers producers bodyguards and associates. The film presents Bieber as an icon with an epic life story -- which is a bit much. Yet his grassroots rise is fascinating. He was the first pop star to rocket to fame via YouTube when his homemade videos caught the eye of talent manager Scooter Braun who flew him to Atlanta. With Braun then Usher as his mentor Bieber was able to sidestep the Nickelodeon/Disney Channel robo teeny-bop machine and the film shows us just why that mattered. Playing the drums (hes a wizard) parading his kung fu fighting moves hes the same boisterous do-what-you-feel kid on stage that he was in those videos. Thats why he leaves the Mileys and Jonases in the dust. Never Say Never does have one structural oddity It counts down day by day to Biebers big Madison Square Garden show but since the concert clips we see along the way are taken mostly from that show the musical momentum doesnt build. When he gets to MSG its almost an anticlimax. Or would be except that Bieber performing with guests like Boyz II Men gives every number a shot of high pizzazz. If this is what it sounds like when a new millennium goes pop Ill take it.

It is draggily paced and lacks felicity of form; the 3-D is a rip-off and the songs are pap save a snippet of Etta James singing ""At Last"" while Biebers glossy fringe sways in slow-motion. The buildup to a Madison Square Garden climax-concert roughly structures Never Say Never; a throat infection creates the threat of cancellation before ""Get well"" Tweets reinforce Biebers rededication to showbiz grind and ""u"" the fans. Interspersed is a retelling of Biebers journey from small-town boy in Stratford Ontario to the outbreak of Bieber Fever. A convincing case is made that the YouTube phenom was a talented kid with a knack for sponging up Top 20 radio styles when promoter ""Scooter"" Braun discovered him. From there the movie admiringly details the stoking of a phenomenon by Braun and Team Bieber; ennobling marketing hustle JB NSN is A Hard Days Night half devoted to Brian Epstein. Theres no scrimping on the Bieber here--we see him serenading onstage shirtless in the dressing room in home videos and in ""candid"" hometown visits--but hes a curiously vague presence obscured in the shadow of this monument to his brand.
