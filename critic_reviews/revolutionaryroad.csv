Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Revolutionary Road -- 4 out of 5 stars Adapted from the novel by Richard Yates ""Revolutionary Road"" is a portrait of an American marriage seen through the eyes of Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) and April (Kate Winslet) Wheeler. Yates story of 1950s America poses a question that has been reverberating through modern relationships ever since can two people break away from the ordinary without breaking apart? Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Did we begin questioning ""The American Dream"" with Richard Yates acclaimed 1961 novel Revolutionary Road? Or was he reporting something that began in the unquestioning 1950s?Call us ""selfish"" or ""childish"" but the marriage with two children house in the suburbs Oldsmobile in the driveway everything and every one buttoned down.. .. . you didnt have to be a beatnik to see that as suffocating. Yates novel becomes a polished perfectly cast film of dreams deferred and pent-up angst unleashed in the hands of Sam Mendes and his stars Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio. We knew years before TVs Mad Men that the 50s werent as conservative and sedate as history once treated them. But for all the dated clothes and vintage cars Revolutionary Road feels less like the period piece Mad Men plainly is. The ""dream"" trap feels as relevant now as it did when Yates novel was heralding the birth of the 60s.Frank (DiCaprio) works in an office in the city at a job he hates but endures because he and perfect-wife April (Winslet) have two children and a house. He puts the half-hearted moves on secretaries drinks at lunch and doesnt take the job the least bit seriously. But hes turned 30. He has responsibilities. April like Frank dismisses their neighbors and colleagues as ""those people"" with their boring bourgeois lives. But she wonders what happened to the curious free spirit she met at a Manhattan party and married seven years ago. Shes really upset at what has become of her. Frank can see it in the once-aspiring actresss eyes as she takes a curtain call for a community theater disaster shes just starred in -- fear grief regret.""I saw a whole other future"" she says. "" I cant stop seeing it.""They fight the way couples fight covering familiar ground. And then April hits on a solution to save their stifled souls. But hope as we all know can be the cruelest trap of all.Mendes (American Beauty) has filmed this as an Oscar showcase for his wife the finest actress of her generation. And Winslet doesnt disappoint. Her rages are straight out of Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf? her heartbreak breaks our hearts. DiCaprio has held on to his boyish charm but his acting still seems mannered -- too many gestures too much working the eyebrows.Kathy Bates is marvelous as the too-friendly Realtor who wants to stay friends if only to give her volcanic son (Michael Shannon brilliant) a hip couple to chat with on his furloughs from the mental hospital. Hes had a breakdown but sometimes it takes a madman to see the obvious. The ""perfect couple"" is doomed.Mendes has made a troubling film that wrestles with big themes and touchy subjects even if it is set in an overly familiar milieu. And hes given his wife the perfect role for her range her empathy and her beauty. If Winslet doesnt win the Oscar for this Meryl Streep should give her heir apparent one of hers. Shes earned it.

"Revolutionary Road | RichardRoeper.com BLOG On Camera RR YOUTUBE CHANNEL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS Home    Movie Reviews    Revolutionary Road Print Page Email Page Search Revolutionary Road (2008; Rated ) B+ "" Bleak austere devastating."" -Richard Roeper MOVIE INFORMATION Revolutionary Road(2008; R)In theaters Friday 26 December 2008 Summary A young couple living in a Connecticut suburb during the mid-1950s struggle to come to terms with their personal problems while trying to raise their two children. Based on a novel by Richard Yates. Genre Drama RomanceDirector Sam MendesCast Leonardo DiCaprio Kate Winslet Kate Winslets face conveys a hundred different types of loathing for her husband in ""Revolutionary Road."" When she is screaming at him when she is literally running out of the house to get away from him when she is hurling verbal darts his way--thats harsh enough. But its the looks she gives him when HE is talking when theyre entertaining guests when theyre at the beach that tell us this woman often despises this man in a profound and frightening manner. It is a great great performance. Winslet plays April Wheeler and the perhaps ever-boyishly handsome Leonardo DiCaprio plays her husband Frank in ""Revolutionary Road"" Sam Mendes painfully faithful adaptation of the 1961 novel by Richard Yates. Set in the mid-1950s ""Revolutionary Road"" is a suburban horror story about a seemingly golden couple whose marriage is rotten to the core. Frank and April keep telling themselves theyre smarter and better and hipper than their surroundings; its as if theyre playing house as one visitor so accurately puts it. April at home with the two kids Frank stumbling upward at a business machine company in Manhattan--this isnt their real life. The real adventure of life will begin when Frank quits his job and they move to Paris where April believes Frank will become the man hes meant to be and she will realize some sort of bohemian dream. Theyre in denial and Paris is a ridiculous mirage. Frank is the first to realize this and try to come to terms with it. April wont go down without a fight and then another fight then another each one escalating in intensity and emotional bloodletting. Kathy Bates shines in a supporting role as a busybody real estate agent who thinks the Wheelers are interesting intellectuals--just the kind of sparkling couple that might help her son snap back from a nervous breakdown. Michael Shannon gives an Oscar-level performance as the son Jack Givings. At first he is enthralled with the Wheelers and their anti-establishment plan--but when he realizes its a sham he turns on them with mad fury. Who knew ""American Beauty"" would turn out to be Sam Mendes lighter take on suburban despair? With his elegant austere style Mendes is the perfect director to make visual the inner monologues of the Yates novel. A work of devastating sadness becomes a film that will make you wince at times even as youre marveling at the performances. Bolstered by Thomas Newmans score spot-on set design and the brilliant source material ""Revolutionary Road"" is a darkly effective portrait of an Eisenhower-era couple who fall tragically short of reaching Camelot.

Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet star in Revolutionary Road. Photo DreamWorks Revolutionary Road 1 / 1 Back to Gallery This borders on sacrilege but Revolutionary Road hangs its melodrama on a several outdated devices. Director Sam Mendes and screenwriter Justin Haythe working from Richard Yates influential 1961 novel have turned in a heavyweight domestic tragedy thats seriously acted and handsomely shot but throws off a strong whiff of moth balls. Maybe its all the passe psychobabbling. Or it might be that old stifled-mommy trope -- the idea that nothing can dampen a ladys spirits like raising children. But I suspect overall that its dialogue like this ""Dont you know? Youre the most beautiful and wonderful thing in the world Youre a man"" Let me clarify This is a good film. If Mendes tried he couldnt make a bad one -- and his return to American Beautys landscape of sun-kissed suburban melancholy has that old familiar layering of compromise and desire. But theres precious little humor this time. Theres no space for irony amid all the weeping and bickering and full-throated fortissimo shouting matches which give way at the end to a quieter ghastlier despair. The wicked novelty of seeing Titanics young lovebirds -- Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet  reunited onscreen after 11 years -- spit bile as unhappy Connecticut parents fades very quickly to battle fatigue. Even an interval of hope and light that illumines the middle section has DOOMED TO HELL written all over it. Everyone and everything in the plot is a harbinger of misery. And its the worst sort of misery the misery of mid-century middle-class married drones. Frank (DiCaprio) and April (Winslet) yearn in italics. They know life is more than a commute to a desk job they feel the urge to break out they long to quit the burbs and move to Paris. In short they want to (heave deep breath) find themselves. Frank the less imaginative of the two doesnt know where to look. He senses vaguely that hes meant for better things -- ""I wanna feel things really feel them"" he says -- but isnt sure which things or how to attain them. April understands more and suffers for it The apron strings that tie her to husband and kids might as well be chains. Its she who agitates for the move to France she who sees it as a form of salvation. Frank craves emotion but she feels enough already. ""This is our chance Frank This is our chance"" Supporting characters bob in and out of their lives Lovers neighbors co-workers. As a friendly real-estate agent with a broken son Kathy Bates blows her usual fresh wind of sympathy and verve. And as the son the reliably high-strung Michael Shannon (Bug) adds to his collection of ominous flakes with a tour-de-force re-enactment of a 1950s psychiatry manual. His little piece of the plot is fun to watch but the role is as exhausted as they come The Crazy-Man Truth-Teller who sees and abhors the tidy lies that line suburban nests. DiCaprio and Winslet do put on a show. Viewers in the mood for rip-snorting marital combat should go ahead and partake but they must prepare to leave the theatre in a state of profound depression. Otherwise if you want to see Winslet giving the performance of her life see The Reader instead. And if youre looking for a chain-smoking throwback to a bygone era -- a time of glossy husbands and starchy wives all of them trapped in a chapter from The Feminine Mystique -- then youre better off with DVDs of Mad Men . That at least never feels dated. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Dynex AA or AAA Battery 48-Pack for 6 + pickup at Best Buy GNC Mega Men Sport 90-Count Multivitamins for 9 + free shipping Dell Venue 10 Pro 32GB 10"" Windows 10 Tablet for 125 + free...

An episode of The Sopranos included a searing fight between Tony and Carmela in which all was laid bare his cheating his lying her greed and tacit acceptance of his lifestyle. It was a marriage worths of resentment boiled down to one scene two great actors making it incredibly compelling. But what if it lasted the entire episode? Or twice that? Thats what happens in Revolutionary Road. Two top-flight actors Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio fight. For two hours. There are other elements mixed in such as the soulless heart of the suburbs but theyre overshadowed by the bitterness and resentment of the characters relationship. Are audiences really eager to shell out 10 to watch something they can do for free at home? The film based on Richard Yates 1961 novel might have felt revolutionary 40 years ago with its portrayal of the dissatisfaction and unhappiness lurking beneath the seemingly perfect surface of well-manicured American suburban life. Coming now its a period piece that shows off two talented actors working in tandem - you may remember their last film together Titanic - but is ultimately as depressing as their lives together. Frank and April Wheeler (DiCaprio and Winslet) have moved out of New York City but dont really think of themselves as suburbanites. She is a frustrated actress caring for their two children. He works at a bland corporation yearning for . . . something else. Its not clear to him or anyone else what exactly. April dreams of moving to Paris of starting over. Frank goes along with the idea but happiness seems doubtful. There is no occurrence in their lives that cannot be ruined by the poison in their relationship. The only respite is their busybody Realtor Helen (Kathy Bates). She brings her mentally ill son John (Michael Shannon in a movie-stealing performance) for visits. Naturally as happens in these kind of things he is able to see through Frank and Aprils pipe dreams into the black heart of their marriage. DiCaprio and especially Winslet are quite good. He gives perhaps his most mature performance and she plumbs the depths of a desperate character. Shannon is amazing a magnetic presence. And director Sam Mendes (Winslets husband) knows something about the suburbs having won an Oscar for directing American Beauty. But unlike the novel which you can set aside and take a break with the film version of Revolutionary Road youre in for the duration and its ultimately too much to take.

(Francois Duhamel/Paramount Vantage) By Ty Burr Globe Staff / January 2 2009 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + Maybe its a cheap shot to call ""Revolutionary Road"" ""American Beauty"" without the laughs but it gets to the heart of the problem. The British director of ""Beauty"" Sam Mendes has returned to probe the existential angst of American suburbia but this time he has a great novel at his back and hes weighed down with his responsibility to literature. This film isnt told its Told. There will be a quiz.After decades of John Cheever J.D. Salinger and ""Mad Men"" the films story line is familiar to the point of cliche. Theres a vast gnawing unhappiness behind the picture windows of the middle class or didnt you know? Published in 1961 Richard Yatess debut novel came at the end of the genres initial post-WWII cycle and the book has lasted only through the awesome surgical relentlessness of its prose. The marriage of Frank and April Wheeler is described in passages that peel apart layers of truths half-truths lies and self-deceit; the book is intensely depressing yet incandescent. Rarely has a writer shot fish in a barrel so brilliantly.Less than half of this makes it to the screen and most of it is brought there by Kate Winslet. She plays April with so many buried reserves of anger sorrow and self-loathing that it hurts to look at her yet the surface is chic and artful. (She makes the desperate housewives on TV look like mannequins.) Her neighbors in late-1950s Connecticut a lumpy suburban couple played by David Harbour and Kathryn Hahn have placed her on a pedestal. Her husband Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) is torn between climbing up there with her and pulling it down.The drama of ""Revolutionary Road"" isnt much which is to say its the stuff of ""real life"" the Wheelers fight like alley cats decide to relocate to Europe get bogged down by inertia and Franks confused ambitions. Some in the audience may object to paying for what they can get at home for free. In the book the couples very ordinariness was a secret they withheld from each other and themselves and that was the tragedy as Yates saw it Were never the stars of our youthful dreams and it hurts like hell to admit it. Where the novel had a cold (and elitist) empathy though the movie is merely cold.Part of the problem is DiCaprio who seems too callow for his role even at 34 (Winslet looks like she could lick him with one hand tied behind her back). Without Yates dissecting his inner motivations into their constituent molecules Frank is a much thinner character. When he drifts into an affair with a secretary at his office (Zoe Kazan herself less interesting than on the page) he seems merely caddish. Mendes cant locate the visual equivalents of the books unsparing psychology so he embalms it with pristine cinematography (by Roger Deakins) costumes (Albert Wolsky) and score (Thomas Newman). Theres a splash of blood toward the end of ""Revolutionary Road"" and it was so perfectly beautiful I wanted to scream.One of the characters that survives this funeral march is John Givings (Michael Shannon) a mentally disturbed man whose mother (Kathy Bates) brings him over to the Wheelers on his days off from the institution to give him someone ""interesting"" to talk with. He functions (rather baldly) as the books jester saying all the cruel things the others cant bear to blurt out but Shannons performance is so angry and unpredictable so weirdly mouthy that ""Revolutionary Road"" jerks briefly to life in his scenes. Here at last is the scorn both Yates and Mendes work so hard to conceal; the movie at least might have been more honest to let more of it show.But again its Winslet - Mrs. Mendes by the way - who shoulders the emotional burden in the films final scenes. This actress is so good so sure of herself that she makes you ache for Aprils descent into bourgeois hell. The Wheelers have young children who as in the book are unimportant stick figures - both book and film have a terror of parenting that is left unexamined - but in Aprils frozen smile you can sense the selfishness thats both monstrous and noble. Winslet gives a fearless performance here. Its not her fault her husband has shrouded it in Taste. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/movienation.

In the Connecticut suburb where fictional characters Frank and April Wheeler find themselves little breaks fresh ground. Looking for the truly rebellious in their 1950s neighborhood would be like searching for orange trees in an Arizona development called Verdant Grove. Based on Richard Yates novel ""Revolutionary Road"" joins a lists of late-season film releases being touted for best-picture Oscar consideration. It is nominated for a Golden Globe.  1/2 RATING | Marital Drama Dont fall for the pretty come-on. Like its cinematic kin ""Frost/Nixon"" and ""Doubt"" this too is a delicately crafted prestige project whose translation to screen doesnt deliver the originals amazements. ""Frost/Nixon"" and ""Doubt"" achieved their deepest unsettling revelations onstage. The big- screen versions are of solid build but hardly shattering experiences. This marital drama comes with name-dropping cachet. Sam Mendes (""American Beauty"" ""Road to Perdition"") directs. Oscar-winning cinematographer Roger Deakins is on board. Most significantly Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are reunited for the first time since their ""Titanic"" success in the 1997 romantic blockbuster. In the opening scene Mendes teases an ache to know where Jack and Rose might have ended up had they been transported to a different era. April and Frank meet beautifully at a party in a New York apartment. Shes an aspiring actress. Hes a WWII veteran a temporary longshoreman. Hes a guy in keeping with an era that gave us Jack Kerouac. They share their bright dreams. Next we see them they are married living on a tree-lined strip of asphalt in a two-story clapboard home with two young children. Throughout the quietly grueling film the kids are AWOL. Frank writes copy for Knox Business Machines in the city. April joined a community theater troupe. After a night of theater they fight on the gravel shoulder of a Connecticut road. Perhaps you know this sort of marital match. Truth fuels the battle but the actual gestures the volume have a kind of overacted theatricality. Recriminations lead to apologies which lead to a plan to reconnect to their bigger selves. Theyll move to Paris. Theyll turn their delusions back into dreams. Light streams in. Franks feels emboldened. April comes alive with confidence. Neighbors and friends like Shep and Milly Campbell get anxious. Is being happily settled just a comfy clapboard house of cards? Yates debut novel was published in 1961 to acclaim. It was reprinted in 1983 to equally vigorous kudos. The New York-born authors place is secure amid the Boswells of suburban agonies like John Cheever and Richard Ford. Mendes and screenwriter Justine Haythe pare Yates laser observations tighten the action to a claustrophobic extreme. This doesnt make it richer. Nor does it make it ""timeless"" -- a compliment lavished on the novel. Like the Wheelers arguments the film rings false. And not because of the notion that the 1950s were the apex of gender hypocrisies. When veins pop in frustration on his brow DiCaprios performance if not believable is at least impressive. Most often his grasp of Frank is tenuous. One is left to root for April. Winslet does compelling work capturing her desperation. But the screenplay robs her of any back story any family. At least Frank can use his woeful tale about his company-man father as a come-on to a green secretary (Zoe Kazan). Bambi meets Godzilla over a few-martini lunch. Kathy Bates is Mrs. Givings the local real estate agent who takes to the beautiful couple. She fondly clucks pleasantries like ""toodle-oo"" ""Ive got to scoot"" and ""just a dollop."" She wants the Wheelers to meet her John whos been institutionalized. Michael Shannons character suggests a heavier edgier David Letterman -- an unnerving thought. As April and Frank flaunt and celebrate their bold move he proves an ally. Of course madmen dont stop speaking frankly just because you start to lie to yourself. Theres a lot of snark in the marketing department of Knox Business Machines. But the satisfying showy knowingness of the AMC series ""Mad Men"" (set a few years later) doesnt fit an adaptation of Yates whose handling of moment place and the people entrapped within it endures. Frank Wheeler cant hold a lit Lucky Strike to Don Draper. No adaptation should invite the question ""Why now?"" But despite its A-list craftsmanship (especially Thomas Newmans memorable score) ""Revolutionary Road"" does just that.

Troy Melhus Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint At the tail end of a season where the most consistent emotion that filmmakers have offered was disappointment tinged with despair comes the bleakest most beautiful downer of them all. ""Revolutionary Road"" is easily the best-acted film of 2008 and one of the most corrosive. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio give turbulent astonishing performances as Frank and April Wheeler a thirtyish couple whose relationship is one part ""Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" one part ""Babbitt"" and one part arsenic. The Wheelers seemed promising initially. We first encounter them at a big-city party full of smart young people making flirtatious small talk and dancing close. ""Frank Wheeler"" she says ""I think youre the most interesting person Ive ever met."" That flattering first impression is gone in a flash. With a single edit we leap ahead several years into their marriage with April a would-be actress fumbling through a community-theater drama. Frank can scarcely conceal his chagrin afterward and his condescending praise compounds Aprils humiliation. Their drive home escalates from exasperation through pent-up resentment into a magma burst of seething rage. No one who has been witness to a disastrous marriage can observe this eruption without a shudder of sympathy. The raw power of the emotions is almost unbearable. Frank and April make a stab at buying contentment when they purchase a prim house in Connecticut. The address -- on Revolutionary Road -- is a constant reminder of the adventurous paths they both fear to travel. As a couple they endure coexistence without intimacy. They are partly prisoners of their egos partly of their environment and era. Richard Yates novel a 1961 National Book Award nominee took a merciless scalpel to the frustrations of midcentury suburban life. Dreamworks Dml - Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio in ""Revolutionary Road"" The Wheelers are trapped in a milieu of stifling conformity he commuting daily amid a crush of cattle in gray flannel to earn their bread she tied tight in an apron at home baking it. But the couples festering discontents arent just an allegory of the time. Their fatal flaw is the unjustified belief that they are uniquely gifted creatures superior to their surroundings -- hubris is a defect in human nature with no expiration date. Frank flatters himself that he has artistic abilities untapped by his job of writing catalog copy for an office machine company. April wants to cast off her domesticity and move with Frank to bohemian Paris where she will type for the diplomatic corps and he will work on ... well something creative. By moving them to France April will convince herself that she married an adventurous free spirit not a timid phony. ""We are the most beautiful and wonderful thing in the world"" she insists. But Frank is a hollow creature and so is she. Frank sneers at the ""hopeless emptiness"" of suburban life while accepting its mausoleum tidiness. April is as superficial as the theater club makeup she daubs on for her disastrous stage debut. Each begins sabotaging the getaway plan to expatriate life as soon as it is announced. Each betrays the marriage with a cheap affair. She keens in wounded neediness and erupts in spittle-flecked rage. He is alternately baffled and belligerent. A scene near the end where a glacially composed Winslet serves the nervous DiCaprio breakfast vividly conjures up the nitroglycerine tension of their relationship. Watching these two tear into each other is like viewing a bullfight Its unspeakably cruel yet mesmerizing. And the ironic casting of ""Titanics"" immortal lovers as brutal antagonists on a marital battlefield is initially funny then deeply upsetting. The supporting cast members serve as red flags to warn the heedless young couple of the dangers awaiting them. Dylan Baker is wickedly sardonic as Franks alcoholic co-worker. Kathy Bates (another ""Titanic"" alum) makes their gossipy real estate agent a humdrum horror. Michael Shannon contributes a scene-stealing turn as Bates institutionalized son a schizophrenic Greek chorus who sees the true hopelessness of the Wheelers lives. There are passages of narrative ham-handedness that weaken the story (a portentous discussion of the safest way to terminate a pregnancy virtually gives you a road map to the storys conclusion) but director Sam Mendes guides the actors to moments of tragic offhand brilliance in almost every scene. This is a movie you cant help but admire even as it tears the bark off you.

In reality they are unfulfilled and quarrelsome.Frank and April thought they and their marriage were special. They were sadly mistaken.By Carrie Rickey Inquirer Movie CriticPosted January 02 2009A cascade of blond hair an exhalation of cigarette smoke the promise of erotic bliss. Thats how April (Kate Winslet) first appears to Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) in Revolutionary Road. Sam Mendes devastating if flawed adaptation of the Richard Yates novel is in part the pipe dream of a gypsy who marries an admirer and sets up camp in the Connecticut suburbs of the 1950s. When the tobacco is extinguished what comes between April and Frank Wheeler is bigger colder and more formidable than the iceberg that sundered Kate and Leo in Titanic shattered hope. To outsiders over coffee or cocktails April and Frank are a golden couple possessed of deep beauty and deeper feelings. But the pair who ordered a special life and got delivered an ordinary one are in fact unfulfilled numb given to declamations like ""I want to feel things really feel things."" The only time they do is when they hurl accusations and ashtrays at each other. (During Wheeler face-offs the children are conveniently elsewhere.) Their Technicolor dreams - she was to be a great actress but has failed in community theater he was to be Somebody but is an Everyman - have given way to khaki reality hauntingly captured by cinematographer Roger Deakins in shades of putty and greige. Like the title of the film which refers to the conformist suburban street on which the Wheelers buy a house ""perkily"" sited on a sloping lawn the characters names are a touch ironic. Frank is not very candid April no longer springlike. He commutes to Manhattan one in a gray wave of business suits to work at a business-machines corporation where under fluorescent lights faceless men in fedoras pretend to work but are really nursing hangovers. As Mendes frames them in the relentless geometry of offices laid out like graph paper they are not Mad Men but Sad Men. Back in Connecticut she folds laundry pares potatoes and dreams of Paris where Frank - billeted there during wartime - said he felt most alive. Like many a character in 20th-century American novels from Dodsworth to The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit April mistakenly assumes that the current of emotional electricity is more intense Over There. Failing to recognize that a change of outside place will not change whats lacking inside the marriage she proposes that the family decamp for Paris where Frank can find himself and they can rediscover each other. At the prospect of being sprung from what she calls her ""trap"" April reclaims her color donning a turquoise sheath bohemian amid the bourgeois shirtwaists. Winslet photographed most glamorously (Mendes is her husband) wrestles heroically with the role of April a woman trying to accept her role as homemaker while yearning for a place in the wider world. Winslet plays April at the extremes of the emotional spectrum either in complete control or completely out of control a woman stifled and denied and projecting her own dissatisfaction onto her spouse. It is a seismic performance one with aftershocks. DiCaprio eyebrows dancing like musical notes along a furrowed staff of forehead is searingly good as a man unmanned by his wifes intensity and his own lack thereof. This is not as some observers say a portrait of the sterile suburbs like Mendes American Beauty; this is the chronicle of a misalliance unsuccessfully renegotiated. Mendes shoots the movie in long takes that intensify the drama but have the unintentional effect of making his film a series of theatrical tableaux. While David Harbour is achingly good as the neighbor who idolizes the Wheelers other supporting players - who include Kathy Bates as a chatty real estate broker and Michael Shannon as her clinically unstable son the films madman savant - sound tinny in what is an otherwise resonant scenario.

(R. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/ movies.) ""Revolutionary Road"" gets my vote as the best American film of 2008. Why do I love it? Let me count the ways 1. Marriage 50s style The movie which stars Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio dissects a marriage an examination that leads in two distinct and significant directions. The movie captures the timeless torment of the unhappy marriage in the way the spouses know each others weak spots and go for the jugular and in the way arguments can veer out of control from the simplest of beginnings. At the same time - and this is important - the film is very specific about the marital pressures peculiar to the films era the mid-1950s. For the man it means a life sentence of unrewarding work. For the woman its a cell door closing. For both its a farewell to dreams. Incidentally the specificity with which director Sam Mendes conveys this era makes it baffling and irritating to hear people compare this film to AMCs ""Mad Men."" ""Revolutionary Road"" is about the 1950s not the early 60s a big difference. Richard Yates who wrote the novel ""Revolutionary Road"" in 1961 understood the difference; thats why he set the book in 1955. Its the difference between Eisenhower and Kennedy between Tennessee Ernie Ford and Chubby Checker and anybody who confuses the two isnt giving this film the attention it demands and deserves. 2. Unforgettable shot Speaking of the 1950s I love the shot of the men getting off the train in the morning at Grand Central Station a sea of hats and gray flannel cascading down the long stairway on the way to some death-mill office job. Who would want to be a part of that? 3. Not your generic marriage The script brilliantly conveys a particular personality dynamic almost guaranteed to make for a glorious courtship and a miserable marriage. Frank (DiCaprio) and April (Winslet) meet and are mutually captivated. His secret desire is to be a big shot. Her dream is to live a life thats truly unique. When they talk about their life dreams they sound as though they share the same ambition Each wants to be distinctive. In fact his desire to be a big shot is the longing of the closet conformist who craves the approval of society and the envy of his peers. And her desire to be unique is the longing of someone who has no need of society or peers. So they get married thinking theyre speaking the same language and then find themselves married and having no idea what the other is talking about. 4. A private scene between husband and wife Frank and April visit their best friends and tell them the good news They plan to sell the house and move to Paris at the end of summer Theyre going to throw off the bounds of conformity and live an adventurous life Later that night the friends (David Harbour and Kathryn Hahn) a married couple alone in their bedroom are utterly thrown. They are millimeters away from confronting their own frustration and life despair. But with an act of will they force themselves to sink back into their delusion. Its painful. 5. Sex and despair I love the use of extra-marital sex in ""Revolutionary Road."" As is so often the case in life its the only creative outlet left to people who have given up hope. Its an expression of deep despair. 6. Leo This is a wonderful role for DiCaprio in that it capitalizes on all thats strong and weak about him his winning smile his glibness his engaging personality and also his slightly superficial lightweight aura. Winslets spirit seems many years older which makes Frank seem no match for Aprils expectations. 7. Kate Winslet is astonishing in this film giving the best performance by an English-speaking actress in 2008. Its all there Aprils enormous dreams and crushing frustration. I love the subdued yet ever-alert way she looks at DiCaprio for signs that he might be the man she thought she was marrying. And I love the way he mostly wilts and sometimes preens under the scrutiny. This is the portrait of a brilliant woman shut in a trap. 8. A silent generation speaks Ive had women in their 80s tell me about life in the mid-1950s how all the cultural markers - movies TV advertisements - told them they should be happy in domestic servitude but they werent. So they thought they were the only ones and were crazy. ""Revolutionary Road"" is a movie about those women. You might think of it as a tribute to them. 9. Michael Shannon. He was Ashley Judds co-star in ""Bug."" Here he plays a mentally ill man who says whatever he thinks and everything he observes about Frank and Aprils marriage is true. He has just a couple of scenes but he dominates them and the screenplay gives him the key line - that everyone admits to the emptiness of suburban life but that ""it takes real guts to see the hopelessness."" 10. Repeat viewings Finally this is a movie that can and should be seen more than once. Watch it one time through her eyes. Watch it again through his eyes. It works both ways. It works in every way. This is a great American film. -- AdvisoryThis film contains strong language and sexual situations. To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies listen to his weekly podcast at sfgate.com/podcasts.

"Revolutionary Road A rather unrevolutionary approach | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesRevolutionary Road A rather unrevolutionary approachThe suburban melodrama Revolutionary Road takes us to a dead end weve been to many times before nearly falling prey to the stifling conformity it seeks to explode.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Jan. 2 2009Starring Kate Winslet Leonardo DiCaprio Kathy Bates and Michael Shannon. Directed by Sam Mendes. 119 minutes. At the Varsity. 14A The suburban melodrama Revolutionary Road takes us to a dead end weve been to many times before nearly falling prey to the stifling conformity it seeks to explode.Adapted from a celebrated 1961 novel by Richard Yates that revealed the postwar myth of purchased happiness the film joins a long list of similar laments about prisons made from white picket fences.Its a textbook example of how quality parts dont always connect to make a satisfying whole. The casting is impeccable both in the leads (Titanic duo Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio) and supporting roles (Kathy Bates and Michael Shannon). The art direction cinematography and score are top-notch almost monotonously so. Mendes and screenwriter Justin Haythe (The Clearing) pay all tribute due to a writer and book that have been unhappily ignored for decades. Oscar recognition would not be unexpected.Article Continued BelowAnd yet somehow the film fails to inspire more than admiration never reaching the same heights of empathy achieved by less impeccable treatments of the same topic. These include the recent Little Children in which Winslet also played an unhappy housewife and Mendes earlier American Beauty in which an airborne plastic bag captured the feeling of being resignedly adrift much more poignantly.Mendes and company are reined in by the same conundrum facing Connecticut couple Frank and April Wheeler (DiCaprio and Winslet) How do you find depth and meaning in the midst of apparent perfection? Its the summer of 1955 and the handsome Wheelers both on the cusp of 30 could be models for a Saturday Evening Post cover. Frank commutes to a well-paying job in Manhattan for Knox Business Machines a company on the verge of the computer revolution. April tends a house at the end of Revolutionary Road - the nicest street in the neighbourhood as real estate agent Helen Givings (Kathy Bates) points out - a nest perpetually bathed in golden sunshine. The couple have two darling children a boy and a girl.And yet both Frank and April yearn for lives of greater meaning although theyre not sure what those would be. When they first met in a party scene glimpsed at the outset April was an aspiring actress and Frank was ""a man with a fine mind"" (to use Aprils words) who was obviously destined for great things.But Aprils acting career is going nowhere (as a dismal community play demonstrates) and Franks ""fine mind"" is grinding out memos to Toledo branch managers about trade shows and stock inventories.Worst of all in their view is how easily the Wheelers have given up on their dreams. Theyve settled for a humdrum domesticity of smokes and cocktails (shades of TVs Mad Men) evenings out with neighbours Milly and Shep Campbell (Kathryn Hahn and David Harbour) and the occasional shag that may still retain passion yet which seems entirely bereft of love.""Our whole existence here is based on the premise that were special"" April moans.Her solution blurted out like a childs discovery is to sell the house quit the job and move to Paris a place April knows only from a faded photo and Franks old war stories. There they can live like the enlightened bohemians they deserve to be with April earning the daily baguette at an easy job while Frank haunts cafes as the great writer he shall surely become.""Why the hell not?"" Frank agrees after some initial skepticism but complications arise. His work suddenly becomes more challenging and more involving - especially when his flirtations with an office secretary (Zoe Kazan) progress past cocktails. And April to her mounting despair and frustration finds herself in a personal situation that could make moving to France a lot tougher than she imagined.Nowhere in this scenario is there any hardship or real sense of the longing that Yates prose so succinctly conjured. Most people viewing the Wheelers - including almost everybody in the world outside of affluent North America - would have trouble identifying with their tiny problems.This is so despite the intriguing re-teaming of DiCaprio and Winslet who warmed so many hearts with their doomed love affair in Titanic more than a decade ago. Its interesting at the outset to think of them as how Jack and Rose might have ended up had not the iceberg sealed their fate.DiCaprio is finally casting off the boyishness that has bedevilled so many of his roles. Hes brought to the top of his game by the abundantly talented Winslet who could play the mad housewife in her sleep (and thats both a virtue and vice for this film). The two argue like a real couple each poking at the weaknesses that only intimacy reveal.They are perhaps too good at playing pretentious and unrealistic characters insulated by their self-absorption. The only truth the Wheelers hear comes from John Givings (Michael Shannon) the schizoid son of realtor Helen who ruthlessly mocks them by pretending to buy into their suburban ennui ""Plenty of people are onto the emptiness but it takes real guts to see the hopelessness."" Hes the shot of adrenalin in a movie badly in need of one the crazy man who is ironically the sanest thing about Revolutionary Road.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

(By Francois Duhamel -- Dreamworks) In ""Revolutionary Road"" based on Richard Yatess novel Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio play a husband and wife doomed by disappointment. (By Francois Duhamel -- Dreamworks) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday January 2 2009 ""Plenty of people are on to the emptiness. But it takes real guts to see the hopelessness."" Thats one of the funniest lines in ""Revolutionary Road"" but its not played for laughs in this somber almost dirgelike adaptation of the 1961 novel by Richard Yates. A chamber-piece of horrors set in 1950s suburbia Sam Mendess film exerts a mesmerizing pull as its beautiful doomed protagonists navigate starkly disappointing adulthoods. Austere controlled achingly sad ""Revolutionary Road"" provides an apt bookend to a holiday season drenched in fatalistic gloom. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet play Frank and April Wheeler who as ""Revolutionary Road"" opens are leading lives of not-very-quiet desperation. Frank who works for a business machine company in Manhattan seems slowly to be becoming his late father who worked for the same outfit. April who stays at home with the couples two children is clearly miserable having tried and failed to find an outlet for her talents in a community theater production of ""The Petrified Forest."" As ""Revolutionary Road"" unfolds over the course of a summer Frank and April make fitful furtive attempts to be happy at least according to their neurotically self-absorbed definition of the word. Frank pursues a desultory affair with a secretary at work (played by the wonderfully expressive Zoe Kazan). April hits on the idea of moving to Paris a city Frank visited during the war and the symbol of everything April hoped life would be when she and Frank started out. Those hopes are never quite articulated in ""Revolutionary Road"" other than Aprils vague references to leading ""interesting"" lives or being ""happy."" Part of the Wheelers tragedy is that they dont have a rhetoric for their experience. April is fighting her role as a full-time homemaker years before Betty Friedan would write about the problem that has no name. Frank is confronting the ambivalence that surrounds his own gender role long before phrases like ""gender role"" would become part of the American lexicon. The subtext of ""Revolutionary Road"" is that the Wheelers never belonged in a tidy Connecticut suburb like the one theyve landed in -- theyre supposed to be hip vaguely bohemian superior or as April calls it ""special."" Theyre ironic but irony doesnt exist in 1955 at least as a viable cultural stance. So theyre left with the boiling increasingly toxic sludge of resignation resentment and dissatisfaction. Those emotions and probably dozens more play with fascinating depth across the face of Winslet who never puts a foot wrong in a performance that calls for April to appear unhinged and then coolly self-possessed in a moments time. The entire psychological arc of ""Revolutionary Road"" can be discerned in Aprils face whose classic features gradually crumple into a reddened mask of despair over the course of her harrowing summer. (It would be interesting to watch ""Revolutionary Road"" with the sound off just to read the movie in Winslets face.) In Franks business parlance April has done her own inventory control. She knows what she has what she needs what she can live without. Frank on the other hand is a squishier character and DiCaprios performance commensurately harder to nail down. On one hand he still seems too boyish too insubstantial to be playing a man coping with the encroaching realities of adulthood (as the movie opens hes just turning 30). But its precisely that childishness thats called for in ""Revolutionary Road"" where the neighbors routinely call one another ""kids"" and the Wheelers even seem too big for their furniture as if one visitor notes theyre playing house. That visitor by the way is a mentally unstable man named John Givings played in the movies finest performance by Michael Shannon. In ""Revolutionary Roads"" most disquieting subplot Johns meddling mother (Kathy Bates) introduces him to the Wheelers because she thinks theyre intellectual. In a series of unhinged encounters John at first endorses the couples bold attempts to fight the ""hopeless emptiness"" then sees through their encroaching self-deception. Its the self-deception that gets you in the end of course and the Wheelers failure to renegotiate their mutual mythology finally sends ""Revolutionary Road"" into its unsettling denouement-- that and their refusal to look beyond their own puling narcissistic attempts at being ""interesting"" to anything larger or more meaningful. With a production design that admirably resists the usual wasp-waists and Pyrex-primary colors of the period and another haunting score by Thomas Newman Mendes creates a kind of prequel to his earlier ode to suburban angst ""American Beauty."" (In its depiction of reluctant adults ""Revolutionary Road"" also echoes Winslets 2006 movie ""Little Children."") Yatess novel which was revolutionary in itself as a masterpiece of realist fiction has deservedly earned scores of admirers over the past four decades especially among writers. For them the movie version isnt likely to offer more by way of interpretive nuance. Rather Mendes and screenwriter Justin Haythe are content with a mere plot-and-dialogue adaptation bleaching out the books Proustian sense of detail and observant humor. The result is that ""Revolutionary Road"" while undoubtedly tasteful restrained and emotionally affecting is a hard movie to love. Its possible to appreciate the hopelessness even while wishing for a little less emptiness. Revolutionary Road (119 minutes at AMC Georgetown Landmarks Bethesda Row and Landmarks E Street) is rated R for profanity and some sexuality and nudity.

"Revolutionary Road stars Kate Winslet Leonardo DiCaprio Michael Shannon - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Revolutionary Road stars Kate Winslet Leonardo DiCaprio Michael Shannon Michael PhillipsTribune critic Sam Mendes the director of ""Revolutionary Road"" injects a few milligrams of hope into his film version of the 1961 Richard Yates novel an excoriating portrait of a mid-1950s marriage built on sticks straw and delusion. It is a harsh merciless book. Yet you wouldnt call it solemn and along with a redemptive grace note or two the film--which is extremely well acted--lays it on pretty thickly. However sterling the craftsmanship the film adaptation inflates the meaning and buffs the atmospheric surfaces of Yates story rather than digging into its guts.Yet its rewards are many. For one Kate Winslet. Its silly to say so especially because everyone else is saying so but she really is an amazing actress able to break your heart and chill your blood in the same instant. (Even in a mediocrity such as ""The Reader"" she comes up with the goods.) Theres a shot early in ""Revolutionary Road"" that captures what Winslet can achieve non-verbally in five seconds screen time. Her character April Wheeler has just finished the opening-night performance of a community theater production of ""The Petrified Forest."" The show alas is a stinker and as April changes clothes in the dressing room waiting for her husband Frank played by Leonardo DiCaprio she nervously plunks herself down at the makeup mirror. As he approaches her face is a fleeting picture of hope and gratitude My man will fix this. He will comfort me. Then out of Franks mouth comes a cutting joking comment about how lousy the show was and the look on Winslets face reflects exactly how ashes taste.A few minutes later Winslet and DiCaprio enact the first of their flaying arguments in ""Revolutionary Road."" At night just off the highway they go at it. Its the sort of fight edging toward physical violence from which no marriage can emerge whole. While Winslets skill and bravery in this scene is no surprise DiCaprios a formidable partner. This is his finest performance. He has been effective before but because DiCaprio is fearless about playing Frank the way April sees him ""a pathetic self-deluded little boy"" all the usual audience-identification issues are off the table. The characters layers of potential meanness selfishness and yearning make for a rich acting challenge and DiCaprio--whose face is that of the eternally boyish outsider--rises to it. The lasting achievement of Yates novel has nothing to do with stultifying suburbia or facile raps on Eisenhower-era conformity. The reason the novel still sings is its specificity and the way it bores into its central couple playing no favorites. The characters suffer from a serious case of exceptionalism. If only Frank could leave his soul-crushing relatively lucrative job at a business machine firm and ""find himself."" If only April could reconnect with her bohemian hearts desire by picking up and moving to Paris and support her husband. If only they hadnt had children so young. At a key juncture late in ""Revolutionary Road"" April says it If only they hadnt had the second child ""to prove the first one wasnt a mistake.""Michael Shannon plays the addled electro-shocked son of the local real estate agent ( Kathy Bates) and hes marvelous in a role--a schematic role to be sure--that feels like a refugee from an Edward Albee play. He is the truth-teller upsetting the suburban apple cart. Shannons wit and off-kilter intimidation tactics are put to exemplary use. And then following Shannons second scene the film slips into a methodical slightly heavy rhythm not helped by composer Thomas Newmans infernal recycling of a six-note piano theme thats enough to drive even the most ardent suburbanite out of town and into a loft somewhere.This is Mendes fourth feature after ""American Beauty"" (suburban anomie already dated) ""Road to Perdition"" and ""Jarhead."" He has yet to develop an interesting camera sense; so far--and this is no crime--he has focused on telling the story and maximizing the theatrical sparks provided by his actors. (He is married to Winslet.) ""Revolutionary Road"" finds Mendes in a pictorially handsome collaboration with cinematographer Roger Deakins who makes the homey but slightly spare domestic interiors along with the Manhattan office and restaurant scenes glow with false promise. Its intelligent work.Maybe ""studious"" is the better word. The final moment re-creates the last couple of lines of Yates novel faithfully. Yet by hitting such moments with a bludgeon rather than a rapier this honorable and often vivid interpretation of a fine sad ice-cold masterwork--the story of a thwarted gray flannel suit and his highball Hedda Gabler--just misses that extra dimension the complexity of feeling Mendes brings to his best stage work. Those who experienced his radical reinterpretation of ""Cabaret"" (as long as they didnt see Teri Hatcher in the touring edition) knew they were in the presence of a major director. On film so far hes not quite major and not quite minor. But when DiCaprio and Winslet unleash their characters demons ""Revolutionary Road"" loses its tight controlled sense of composition and air of solemnity and in human terms matters. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating R (for language and for some sexual content/nudity ) Running time 159 Opening Friday Starring Leonardo DiCaprio (Frank Wheeler); Kate Winslet (April Wheeler); Kathy Bates (Helen Givings); Michael Shannon (John Givings); David Harbour (Shep Campbell); Kathryn Hahn (Milly Campbell); Zoe Kazan (Maureen Grube); Richard Easton (Howard Givings) Directed by Sam Mendes; written by Justin Haythe based on the novel by Richard Yates; photographed by Roger Deakins; edited by Tariq Anwar; music by Thomas Newman; production designed by Kristi Zea; produced by John N.

It is said we go to the movies to escape after all and Yates great subject was the very thing many of us seek to escape -- namely the lives of prefabricated mediocrity we settle for when personal ambition yields to the desire to be ""just like everyone else."" Decades before divorce lawyers and prescription pharmaceuticals became convenient panaceas for all that ails us Yates (1926-1992) pulled back the curtain on Audens ""age of anxiety"" and found that the Plasticine dream of suburban bliss was something closer to a waking nightmare.So theres a wonderfully perverse irony in the fact that the film version of Yates first and most lauded novel Revolutionary Road stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet -- the very actors who as the star-crossed lovers in James Camerons Titanic defined ever-lasting movie romance for an entire generation of filmgoers. Here Kate and Leo again strive to keep their heads above water gasping for air. Only in Revolutionary Road the sinking ship pulling them under is their own marriage.Like many of Yates characters Frank and April Wheeler appear to be the most average of postwar average Americans -- he a midlevel worker bee for the same New York corporation where his father eked out a similarly anonymous existence she a stay-at-home mother of two with a well-kept house in a tree-lined corner of western Connecticut. But it wasnt so long ago that Frank was a combat-vet-turned-Lower Manhattan bon vivant -- ""an intense nicotine-stained Jean-Paul Sartre sort of man"" Yates writes -- and April was a young starlet who fell under his worldly spell. And despite their newfound comfort and prosperity they have both held on to this memory of earlier times used it to convince themselves that they were once ""interesting"" people and could be so again. Deep down they know that this life of suburban anonymity isnt for them. Deeper down they fear they may be wrong.In what may be a last-ditch attempt to save themselves April makes an inspired proposal Why dont they just pack it all in and move to Paris where shell take a job and Frank will be free to ... well to ""find himself""? And for a while their escape plan buoys the Wheelers gives them even greater contempt for the pettiness -- the ""hopeless emptiness"" as Frank memorably terms it -- of everything around them. Until that is April gets the news that sends their cant-miss plan on a collision course with a metaphorical iceberg. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm Directed by Sam Mendes from a scrupulously faithful adaptation by Justin Haythe Revolutionary Road isnt a great movie -- it lacks the full soul-crushing force of the novel -- but what works in it works so well and is so tricky to pull off that you cant help but admire it. By no means an easy candidate for adaptation Yates dwells in the shadow area between peoples conscious and subconscious selves between the faces they show to the world (and even their spouses) and the ones they see when they look in the bedroom mirror at night. To fully grasp Revolutionary Road is to understand that two people can be at their most alone when they are together -- and Mendes whose American Beauty rendered a similar investigation of suburban anomie as a gallery of over-the-top comic grotesques willingly goes there. Where the earlier movie was easy to brush off this one gets under your skin It is to Mendes great credit that Revolutionary Road will likely lead to some tense moments between many a young couple on their drive home from the cinema.Some will quibble that Kate and Leo are too glamorous to convincingly portray the dream-deferred middle class but its essential to Revolutionary Road that Frank and April come across as the sort of ordinary people other ordinary people envy and in that respect the casting is spot-on. As Winslet has already demonstrated once this season (in The Reader where she is the only compelling reason to see the film) among her seemingly boundless gifts as an actress is an acute grasp of bright young women beset by some intractable inner torment. DiCaprio meanwhile plays Frank with the faintly emasculated authority of so many outgoing well-bred young men who still haunt the corridors of corporate America -- men who may have once aspired to live la vie Parisienne or play pro ball or write the Great American Novel before time and tide made them settle for less Olympian lives. But the movies one stroke of real genius arrives in the form of the tall jittery character actor Michael Shannon who shows up for two scenes as the paranoid schizophrenic son of the Wheelers matronly real estate agent (Kathy Bates). Brought to meet Frank and April as part of his attempted re-entry into society he immediately recognizes the unhappy couple as some kind of fellow travelers and Yates (who himself spent time in various ""bughouses"") imparts to him the storys most resonant observation ""Plenty of people are onto the emptiness but it takes real guts to see the hopelessness.""Perhaps owing to his stage background Mendes is the sort of movie director who tends to come up with a single all-encompassing stylistic concept and then rarely deviates from it. That seemed like a shortcoming in his previous films but in Revolutionary Road it translates into a stately semi-detached observational approach that makes it seem as if Frank and April Wheelers Good Housekeeping home were itself directing the movie. Which is only fitting for a film that by the end turns into a far more unsettling haunted-house story than The Amityville Horror. A friend who attended an early Revolutionary Road screening complained that it gave him the feeling of watching two John Cassavetes characters trapped in a Yasujiro Ozu film; but this it seems to me is precisely the point. Even after Frank and Aprils climactic knockdown-dragout argument chez Wheeler is markedly undisturbed -- sitting there biding its time waiting to devour its next victims and their futile ambitions.REVOLUTIONARY ROAD | Directed by SAM MENDES | Written by JUSTIN HAYTHE based on the novel by RICHARD YATES | Produced by JOHN N.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor December 26 2008 Save for later Saved Leonardo DiCaprio and April Wheeler star in Revolutionary Road Courtesy of Francois Duhamel/Dreamworks          View Caption About video ads View Caption of What is it about the 1950s that brings out the worst in cultural historians? The received wisdom is that this era that gave us Mailer and Ginsberg and Kerouac and Brando and Dean was in fact a bastion of strait-laced - i.e. straitjacketed - conformity. People suburbanites especially lived lives of quiet desperation in their look-alike ticky-tacky dwellings. Wives were obsessed with spotless kitchens. Commuter trains served up faceless men in gray flannel suits to the gaping maw of Manhattan and then back again to the two-car garage and the 2.5 children.The latest movie to plug into this cautionary myth is ""Revolutionary Road"" set in the mid-50s and based extremely faithfully on the celebrated 1961 novel by Richard Yates. The director is Sam Mendes who plumbed these shallows once before in ""American Beauty"" which though contemporary felt 50-ish. The new film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet who previously appeared together in ""Titanic."" This is another kind of disaster movie on dry land.Frank Wheeler (DiCaprio) and his wife April (Winslet) live in a Connecticut suburb that is suffocatingly prim. He works at a dull job in Manhattan at a business-machines corporation; she is a frustrated actress who suddenly has the bright idea to drop everything and make a fresh start in Paris. She will support the family while he tries to find himself. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The problem is Frank already pretty much knows who he is. A bland soul lurks beneath that blandly handsome exterior. Although he humors April its clear they have about as much chance of moving to Paris as Chekhovs Three Sisters had of relocating to Moscow. The die is cast when April tells Frank that Paris is their one chance and with a jokesters irony he replies ""Were running from the hopeless emptiness of the life here."" Hes too enamored by hopelessness to leave. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Revolutionary Road Mendes and his screenwriter Justin Haythe are overly enamored of ennui. They cast such a pall over the proceedings that at times we seem to be watching a species of vampire movie - which in a sense is what all these soulless suburbia films are. (See also or better yet dont see ""The Ice Storm"" and ""Little Children."") The filmmakers havent figured out that despair is more wrenching when the people doing the despairing have something vital to lose. The Wheelers dont even appear to care for their children to whom Mendes likewise gives short shrift or have much more on their minds than mood swings and the cocktail hour. Although in the course of the film April descends into a kind of madness we are never brought into her pain. We stand apart from the misery because Mendes is anatomizing these people instead of getting inside their skins.Yates in his novel penetrated the hearts of his protagonists with a mercilessness that at times was borderline sadistic. In a way hes as much to blame as anybody for what went wrong with the movie. Hes the one after all who set up these archetypes. The fact that he set them up so skillfully doesnt absolve him. (What would Yates or Mendes for that matter make of TVs ""Mad Men"" where the suburban 50s vampires at least have some vitality?)Only once in ""Revolutionary Road"" does the film break through its studied air of high-toned moping. As John Givings the mentally unstable son of a local real estate agent (Kathy Bates) Michael Shannon has only a few scenes but he cuts through them like a straight razor. John is a deranged truth-teller who instantly zones in on the Wheelers dire predicament. In this cookie-cutter community his craziness represents a higher form of sanity. This may be a mythologizing of insanity but while youre watching John youre grateful hes around to say what everybody else isnt.DiCaprio and Winslet comport themselves as best they can under the circumstances which means they dont entirely blend into the blandness. Some of their spats seem like warm-ups for ""Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" which came a decade later. It doesnt say much for a movie when you want to see its protagonists slap each other around just to keep the circulation going.""Revolutionary Road"" is a sad experience but the sadness has no emotional heft because its people have none. This movie hasnt earned its funk. (Rated R for language some sexual content/nudity.)

(Francois Duhamel) Joe Neumaier Wednesday December 24 2008 109 PM Drama about a couples tense marriage in the 1950s. With Leonardo DiCaprio Kate Winslet. Director Sam Mendes. (159). R Language sexuality. At area theaters. As a whole Sam Mendes film of ""Revolutionary Road"" comes close but falls short of capturing Richard Yates terrific novel. Yet in pieces and in spirit the many honest parts of this drama about marital life in the 1950s are like the rooms of a house that feel right even if the exterior slopes somewhat clumsily. Yates 1961 book dissected Americas postwar promise soul-killing suburban life and the self-delusion within marriage so sharply that the movie -- two-thirds ""Mad Men"" one-third ""American Beauty"" with a John Cheever chaser -- works best when focusing on the personal. Thankfully its there that Mendes and screenwriter Justin Haythe catch some of Yates weighty ideas and where Leonardo Di-Caprio and Kate Winslet succeed in doing the heavy lifting. DiCaprio is Frank Wheeler a commuting Connecticut man of 1955 whose job in a Manhattan office isnt what his wandering soul and intellectually hungry mind were made for. Or so he says since when his wife April (Winslet) abruptly proposes moving to Paris Frank is shaken. What about their two young kids? What about money? April who hoped to be an actress before she slammed into societal expectations has it all figured out. Still Frank for all his talk is comfortable at the end of Revolutionary Road. Though maybe hes ""comfy in the hope less emptiness"" as John Givings (Michael Shannon in a great quirky turn) says. The mentally unhinged son of the neighbor-hood busybody (Kathy Bates) John calls out Frank and April for being untrue to themselves. April however has become accidentally pregnant again. When she suggests alternatives Frank simply shouts louder and suggests that maybe its April whos actually unhinged. Theres much more to ""Revolutionary Road"" than that and its beauty is in the details Frank and April walking silently up a hallway after she performs in a play; the kindness in their manners as they sit for breakfast; the frantic run he breaks into when theres nowhere to go. Some choices dont work as well as others -- an opening flashback to Frank and Aprils first date might have been more powerful at the end and their friends the Campbells should have been handled less broadly -- though they never torpedo the film. And DiCaprio round-shouldered and sleepy-eyed and Winslet watchful and alert raise up each other and everything around them. Never once shadowed by ""Titanic"" they suggest often wordlessly the box the Wheelers have found themselves in. Whereas the novel is told mostly from Franks viewpoint the movie is just as much Aprils and Winslet whether fighting back or fighting back tears is sensational.

Revolutionary Road (R) Paramount Vantage (119 min.) Directed by Sam Mendes. With Leonardo DiCaprio Kate Winslet. Opens Friday at theaters in New York. FOUR STARS She is willing to pull the kids out of school sell the house move to Europe and go to work -- for him you understand so he can have the luxury of time off to think about what he really wants to do. He is willing to stay here stay on in a dull job even take the promotion he doesnt want -- for her you understand so that they can have another child and enjoy some of the luxuries theyve done without. They are really truly only thinking of the other. They are really truly such clueless self-deceivers. The crossed-signals and secret selfishness of a bad marriage are the sour heart of ""Revolutionary Road"" a new film from director Sam Mendes based on the novel by the criminally underappreciated Richard Yates. And it is devastating. Although it stars those young lovers of ""Titanic"" Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet there is little glamour to it and even less romance. And all its disasters -- tragically horrendously man-made -- unfold in the gray-flannel suit world of 1955 Connecticut. Frank is a World War II vet who thinks vaguely he should be doing something exceptional -- but instead merely takes the 814 from Darien every morning to work in a frosted glass cubicle at an office-machine company. Hes begun to hide his discontent behind extra martinis and girls from the secretarial pool and a slight smug superiority. April once had dreams of acting -- but now she simply stays at home with their children bringing out dinner in her starched apron. She is desperate for something different something else. But when she talks of Europe her neighbors look horrified. When she tells her husband she doesnt think she loves him anymore he suggests a psychiatrist. Its a momentary pleasure to see these two former co-stars -- who burst upon the screen more than a decade ago -- reunited on the screen. But the thrill that lasts is watching them inhabit these characters without fear and hesitation or without any of the winks to the audience that a less confident actor might give. Nor does Mendes approach this with the kind of smirk that occasionally surfaced in ""American Beauty"" a movie which also dealt with unhappy adults and childish adulteries -- and yet thanks to Alan Balls script occasionally did so with caricature and condescension. Mendes (who is of course married to Winslet) has more forgiveness in him. These are not monsters he says. These are people like us (but one hopes a good deal worse.) And yet instead of bringing them to self-righteous justice both actors do the harder thing of bringing them to life. So we see DiCaprios dull pain as -- his still-boyish face contorted and on the edge of tears -- he pitches a tantrum when his wife denies him her love. We see Winslets icy anger -- and eventual anguished helplessness -- as she realizes how trapped she is. And we begin to realize that this will not end well. It doesnt end well for anyone really -- not in most of Yates work and certainly not in this movie. Yet there are still light moments. Michael Shannon -- the Marine of ""World Trade Center"" -- has always had an off-center quality. Here he mines it for dark humor as a mentally ill misfit -- the only adult who can see how mad this modern world is and bravely speaks truth to the so-called sane. Yet they still go mad anyway and hurt each other in their fits like children striking out in the dark. ""Revolutionary Road"" takes its name from Frank and Aprils perfect block; so nice so green so ideal for raising children. But it also unconsciously signifies a journey the entire country is about to take. In another dozen years or so women like April will be able to plan their families to go back to work to find other creative outlets than the nicest new recipe for chicken a la king. Or not if they choose to. But that is the point. They will have that choice. But this is 1955. And for now for many ""Revolutionary Road"" is a very pretty very quiet dead-end street. Rating note The film contains sexual situations strong language and alcohol abuse. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Paramount Pictures By Joe Morgenstern Updated Dec. 25 2008 1159 p.m. ET If time flowed backward for me as it does for Brad Pitt in ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" I would have been almost three hours younger by the time the end credits rolled around. No such luck on that score but David Finchers majestic fantasy left me happier than I could have imagined Id be. Eric Roths screenplay inspired by a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald turns on a single device. A baby is born old -- not just old but downright senescent -- and youthens as he grows. Yet the film which co-stars Cate Blanchett quickly outgrows any sense of gimmickry and matures into a one-of-a-kind meditation on mortality times inexorable passage and the fleeting sweetness of love. Watch a scene from the film ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" starring Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. Video courtesy of Paramount Pictures. Time is of the essence in more ways than one. The production takes its time and uses it wisely in tracking Benjamins development from an ugly incubus through a teenage codger to a middle-aged 26-year-old whos certainly spry but still too old for Ms. Blanchetts Daisy. She is Bens contemporary a friend from their New Orleans childhood whos become an impossibly ravishing ballet dancer. Not until he grows 15 years younger and she grows 15 years older however are they right for each other physically as well as spiritually. ""My God"" Daisy says at one point in their mid-40s ""look at you -- youre perfect."" Its a charming laugh line since he has finally emerged as a fully recognizable Brad Pitt. And what a remarkable presence the actor is not just during that golden era but before and after when he has only his voice and eyes with which to fashion Bens character while the wonders of digital technology and age-confounding makeup provide his body and face. Its a great performance by any measure but let me count some of the other ways that Mr. Finchers film is remarkable. Ms. Blanchetts performance to be sure; shes breathtaking in a long red dress dancing in a fog-shrouded gazebo; otherwise shes simply dazzling and deeply affecting. A supporting cast that includes Tilda Swinton Taraji P. Henson Jason Flemyng and Jared Harris. Alexandre Desplats score as exquisite and evocative as the Scott Joplin concert waltz woven through it. Claudio Mirandas sumptuous cinematography Donald Graham Burts art direction and production design and Jacqueline Wests costumes. ""Benjamin Button"" is all of a visionary piece and its a soul-filling vision. Waltz With Bashir Ari Folmans ""Waltz With Bashir"" is an absolute stunner a feature-length animated documentary from Israel in which the force of moving drawings amplifies eerily powerful accounts of war shaky remembrance and rock-solid repression. See a clip from the film ""Waltz With Bashir."" Video courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics. The film begins with the riveting image of vicious orange-eyed dogs coursing through the blue-black streets of nighttime Tel Aviv. By the time its over those dogs denizens of one ex-soldiers recurrent nightmare have been connected to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and to Israels indirect responsibility for a Christian militias massacre of Palestinian refugees. Connections were what Mr. Folman was after. A veteran of that war he made the film as an experiment in self-therapy after realizing how little he recalled of an experience that should have been as unforgettable as it was terrible. At bottom ""Waltz With Bashir"" -- the title relates to the battle rapture of an Israeli soldier in Beirut -- is a conventional documentary in which the filmmaker tries to elicit information from real-life countrymen who went to war with him. Yet it breaks with convention in two ways. The more obvious one is stylistic -- the testimony we hear often flattened and matter-of-fact is heightened by the sensational sometimes surreal animation. The other break is substantive and shocking. If connections were the goal disconnections are the discovery. Mr. Folmans witnesses dont remember their time in Lebanon any more reliably than he does so his self-therapy proves a failure. But his signal success lies in charting the human minds gift for keeping bad memories at bay. War is hell as everyone claims to know but heres a baleful new perspective on the subject. Wars are fought the film tells us then literally forgotten. Valkyrie Two dramatic arcs intersect in ""Valkyrie"" a big old-fashioned action adventure starring Tom Cruise as Claus von Stauffenberg the aristocratic German army colonel who in 1944 led the July 20 plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler. In addition to the plot itself theres the arc of Mr. Cruises career from ""Risky Business"" to the riskier business of embodying an authentic German hero in a lavish English-language production with limited suspense; the audience -- at least some of it -- knows that the plot failed. So how does the film work? Well enough in the end. Mr. Cruises performance turns out to be brisk and reasonably plausible though unexceptional while the production as a whole succeeds as an elaborate procedural impressively staged in historical locations. See a clip from the film ""Valkyrie."" Video courtesy of United Artists. The director was Bryan Singer best known for ""The Usual Suspects""; he worked from a script by his writer on that film Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander. Newton Thomas Sigel did the stunning cinematography and Lilly Kilvert and Patrick Lumb collaborated on the splendid production design. Mr. Singer comes as close as anyone could to sustaining the illusion of action when nothing is happening and nothing much happens for quite a while apart from the hatching of Stauffenbergs plot and the exchange of meaningful glances. (My favorite moment of throbbing inertia comes when someone says hes going to lunch and the announcement is met by a tympani roll.) Once the plotters plunge into action though ""Valkyrie"" becomes both an exciting thriller and a useful history lesson. Younger members of the audience may not have known that the Nazi armys officer corps contained nests of determined resistance to Hitlers madness. Revolutionary Road ""Revolutionary Road"" was adapted from Richard Yatess highly regarded novel about stifling conformity in 1950s suburbia. The movie is stifling all right and depressing in the bargain. The road of the title is the address of April and Frank Wheeler the couple played by Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio; its also the figurative road that April wants them to follow an escape route from suburban life to the freedom of expatriate life in Paris. The best scene is the opening one when April and Frank first meet at a Manhattan party and he cheerfully admits that he has no idea what he wants to do with his life. In fact Frank is a black hole that sucks up whatever energy the movie musters. (Ms. Winslet has several powerful scenes and Zoe Kazan finds variety and spontaneity in the minor role of Franks sexual playmate at the office.) The pompous direction was inflicted by Sam Mendes who seems to regard the 1950s as a foreign country. Last Chance Harvey ""Last Chance Harvey"" is a good chance to see two superb actors having their way with wafer-thin material. Dustin Hoffmans Harvey and Emma Thompsons Kate meet by chance in London. Chance in this case means the laborious workings of an anti-surprise script; in scene after scene the outcome is clear from the start. The title also refers to Harveys plight. Long divorced and newly jobless he has flown in from New York for the wedding of his almost-estranged daughter and sees Kate as his last shot at a happy life. See a clip from ""Last Chance Harvey."" For a while Joel Hopkinss romantic comedy is little more than bright banter and naked contrivance. Parallel passages follow the equally lonely Harvey and Kate (she works in customer relations at Heathrow airport) as they dont meet again then almost do then do. But the film catches fire when Harvey brings Kate to the wedding reception. Thats where Mr. Hoffman seizes a good moment that the script has given him and turns it into a speech thats worth the price of admission. Suddenly the actors art transforms contrivance into the defining moment of a mans life. Marley amp; Me The Marley of ""Marley amp; Me"" is by his owners account the worlds worst dog. This is far from the worlds worst dog movie -- youd have to be made of granite to resist all the charms of a free-spirited 100-pound Lab. Yet the production manages against heavy odds to make its canine star an incorrigible bore. The problem is bad parenting. Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston are John and Jenny Grogan a husband and wife who supposedly learn life lessons from Marley as their family grows through the years. What lessons though? They never seem to grasp the concept that dogs must be trained. Find related TV listings at LocateTV. Bedtime Stories Disneys ""Bedtime Stories"" looks cute in the trailers thanks to a bug-eyed computer-generated guinea pig named Bugsy. Be forewarned though. Bugsy is only a shill for a particularly crude and disjointed Adam Sandler comedy. If you listen carefully to the strains of ""When You Wish Upon a Star"" during the Disney corporate intro you may hear Walt moaning in his grave. See a clip from ""Bedtime Stories."" Mr. Sandler is no stranger to crudity; its intrinsic to his slob esthetic. ""Im like the stink on your feet"" he says in this one ""Ill always be around."" Hes Skeeter Bronson a hotel handyman who tells his niece and nephew bedtime stories that have a magical way of coming true. (Theyre garishly overproduced stories that mimic ""Star Wars"" assorted Westerns and ""Spartacus."") Still the crudity here isnt confined to a few fart jokes. As a PG-rated film opening on Christmas Day under the Disney banner ""Bedtime Stories"" would seem to promise fairly wholesome family entertainment. What it delivers is the glitzy allure of a hotel setting smarmy double entendres Ferrari lust Beverly Hills bling and pneumatic babes -- one of the characters is a surrogate Paris Hilton. The real bug-eyed guinea pigs will be the little kids in the audience.

Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button Deck the halls with scheming Nazis--and withered arthritic babies and seething suburban housewives. Those are the grim bundles waiting under the Hollywood tree this recessional holiday season. Its somehow appropriate to the economic moment that the three big Christmas-week releases-- Valkyrie The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Revolutionary Road--are about grand failures of one kind or another. Theres the failed plot to assassinate Hitler in Valkyrie the failure of the human body (even a backward-aging one) to conquer time in Button and the Titanic-sized failure of Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprios marriage in Revolutionary Road. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Advertisement It might be argued that all three movies not only depict failure but enact it. Valkyrie the first film out of United Artists Studios since Tom Cruise became the studios sole head last summer has been something of a cursed production dogged by rumors of reshoots and perpetually changing release dates. Its director Bryan Singer talks big but he has to be anxious about the films reception after the universally shrugged-at Superman Returns (2006). And as Slates Stephen Metcalf suggests in his glorious reading of Tom Cruise-as-market-bubble the notion of the stolidly perky Cruise playing a one-eyed one-handed would-be Hitler assassin is just inherently funny. Given all these obstacles Valkyrie comes off surprisingly well. The first half-hour or so does proffer some unintended chuckles as the script strains unnecessarily to provide its hero Col. Claus von Stauffenberg (Cruise) with background character and motivation. Motivation?? We dont need to learn about the source of Stauffenbergs war wounds (he loses an eye and a hand in a North African bombing raid) or his love for his wife (Carice van Houten) to understand that he wants to kill Hitler. We get it. On with the Hitler-killing Once Singer dispenses with the introductory pathos and gets to the nuts and bolts of Stauffenbergs plan Valkyrie becomes an admirably modest and compact suspense thriller. Stauffenberg and his co-conspirators in the German army (played by the plummily British likes of Bill Nighy Tom Wilkinson and Terence Stamp) arrange to smuggle an explosive-laden briefcase into a meeting with the chancellor. They also secretly make changes to a succession plan Hitler has had drawn up in the event of his death (occasioning one of the films few intentionally funny lines ""Now all you have to do is get Hitler to sign it""). For a thriller with a thoroughly foreordained outcome Valkyrie does a pretty good job at making the viewers palms sweat. Especially so soon after the tedious pieties of The Reader Im not sure I want more from my Nazi holiday viewing than that. Revolutionary Road(Dreamworks) Sam Mendes adaptation of the 1961 novel by Richard Yates hasnt a hair out of place. Its a textbook example of a well-crafted movie beautifully shot impeccably acted and structured like an elegant three-act play. (You can almost imagine the red velvet curtain descending at the end of each act.) So why does the movie feel as pleasantly deadening as the midcentury Connecticut suburb where it takes place? It certainly isnt Kates or Leos fault. Winslet is as ever divine as the repressed April Wheeler who gave up her dreams of becoming an actress to marry Frank (DiCaprio). And while DiCaprio lacks Winslets emotional reach as an actor hes perfectly cast as the cocky self-deluded Frank who commutes to an office job he hates in order to support their two children. Bored stiff by their emotionally sterile life April suggests they shake things up by moving the whole family to Paris. This prospect briefly rekindles the Wheelers marriage until ... well lets just say the last scene isnt a happy family picnic atop the Eiffel Tower. Advertisement Maybe this movies curious emptiness has to do precisely with the actors appeal their matinee-scale beauty and charisma. Yates novel used implied interior monologue--what Flaubert called ""free indirect style""--to indicate the vast gulf between how April and Frank thought of themselves (as thwarted bohemians) and what they really were (fearful middle-aged suburbanites). Without that layer of built-in irony the Wheelers protestations that theyre too good for the life theyre trapped in seem straightforwardly true and what should be a bleak social satire instead reads as a banal melodrama. When April miserably informs her husband that for all their aspirations ""Were just like everybody else"" the audience reflexively protests ""No youre not Youre Kate and Leo He gave his life for you at the end of Titanicfor Gods sake"" The couples on-screen history is part of what gives the Wheelers their undeniable chemistry (even if most of Frank and Aprils chemistry is used to formulate the vitriol they hurl at one another). But that same history--Leo proclaiming himself ""king of the world"" Kates arms outstretched at the prow--is a part of what keeps us on the outside of the Wheelers story unable to find the small-time schemers in the faces of these larger-than-life stars. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button(Warner Bros.) adapted by David Fincher from an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story is the lengthiest and most ambitious of all the Christmas releases yet its the one I have the least to say about. Two hours and 55 minutes is a long time to sustain a mood of puckish whimsy especially when the frame-story narrator is a dying old woman (Cate Blanchett in age makeup) lying immobilized on a hospital bed. Fincher is a technical magician He can convincingly (digitally?) create the illusion that Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) is aging in reverse; that he--and we--are caught in the middle of a World War II naval battle; and that Cate Blanchett a 39-year-old mother of three is an airborne teenage ballerina. But Finchers magic cant transform him from the coldly dispassionate misanthropist of Se7en Fight Club and Zodiac into a sentimental humanist and it cant turn Brad Pitt into the kind of actor who can carry a movie like this. Dont get me wrong Pitts great in character roles as a comic grotesque or an unrepentant scoundrel. (See Burn After Reading or for that matter Fight Club.) But as a passive introspective leading man like Benjamin hes just dull. Theres not enough going on behind those deep-blue peepers to justify a Forrest Gump-esque jaunt through 80-plus years of American history (though it is amusing to watch that familiar chiseled Pitt face emerge from layers of excellent age makeup). The melancholy final scenes have Blanchett as Benjamins true love Daisy caring for her once-husband as he gradually regresses to babyhood and she approaches old age. This vision of two lives criss-crossing as they ebb finally achieves a profundity the rest of the movie strains for but it comes about two hours and 25 minutes too late.

Theyre a state of mind a mythology we all know in our bones. The myth goes something like this The suburbs are comfortable maybe even beautiful but their serenity is rooted in a friendly American conformity so that the people who live there have to repress their true selves which will emerge when they drink too much and have affairs or rage at each other for their dishonesty which was all caused in the first place by...the suburbs. The best thing about Revolutionary Road a cool-blooded and disquieting adaptation of Richard Yates 1961 novel about a powerfully unhappy Connecticut couple is that it doesnt end with that rote vision of bourgeois anomie. It only begins there. Frank and April Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) are about 30 with two kids and both believe they can evade the traps of the existence theyve chosen. The year is 1955 and Frank has a New York job that bores him marketing business machines. He takes solace in feeling superior to his work and also in his midday martinis and occasional dip into the secretarial pool. April meanwhile wanted to be an actress and still feels shes meant for higher things. Moved to reach for something more April comes up with a plan She and Frank will sell their home and move to Paris where shell work as a government secretary and he will...find himself. (Its like a 60s fantasy a decade ahead of time.) Revolutionary Road was directed by Sam Mendes who made the glibly scathing American Beauty only here he wants us to share not just Frank and Aprils misery but the frail reveries that hold them together. The escape-to-Paris idea is naive impractical -- a pipe dream. Yet its fueled by something Mendes captures about the 50s an era when people often had deep imaginative sparks that exceeded their ability to voice them. Winslet has the tricky job of making us see the glimmer of wisdom in Aprils cockeyed plan and she pulls it off even as DiCaprios Frank -- chipper forthright wholesome even in betrayal -- tugs the couple back to reality. Revolutionary Road has deception adultery operatic shouting the then-forbidden specter of abortion and a few scenes that spotlight the remarkable performance of Michael Shannon as John Givings a mathematician whos been hospitalized for insanity and who proves how unfit for society he is by making every acid comment cut to the truths that no one else will speak. The film is lavishly dark -- some might say too dark -- yet Id suggest it has a different limitation For all its shattering domestic discord theres something remote and aestheticized about it. April brings a private well of conflict to her middle-class prison but Winslet is so meticulous in her telegraphed despair that she intrigues us moves us yet never quite touches our unguarded nerves.

Francois Duhamel/DreamWorks i Just over a decade ago Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio played a couple who fell in love in the movie Titanic. Now theyre reunited in a film called Revolutionary Road and this time theyre playing two people who are just titanically unhappy. Not when they meet of course. In their early days together April and Frank wanted it all. It was the 1950s and Frank had dreams but no job; April pictured a life as an actress. The future was theirs. Then Frank got a job April got pregnant and high-minded talk of Paris and of ""feeling things"" faded into the background. Dreams deferred they started talking to realtors. Buy the house in the suburbs go to work take out the garbage have an affair -- slowly these two mortgage their dreams. Their marriage turns sour they end up at each others throats and then things really go wrong. Now Ive been telling the story chronologically but the movie and the novel its based on dont. Revolutionary Road jumps around in time with the result that you dont get to know April and Frank before you see them at each others throats. Director Sam Mendes makes 50s suburbia a persuasively suffocating place -- he did the same for 90s suburbia in American Beauty remember. But these characters are so selfish and self-centered and the screenplay is so calculated about bringing them to their knees that the movie feels sort of hermetically sealed. Was conformity in the 1950s really that straitjacketing you wonder? Just as youre wondering happily an expert in straitjackets shows up -- the real-estate agents son fresh from the mental hospital which makes him the ultimate 50s nonconformist someone who says what he means. ""You want to play house youve got to have a job; you want to play very nice house very sweet house then youve got to have a job you dont like"" he all-too-accurately tells Frank. ""Anyone comes along and says What do you do it for? -- hes probably on a four-hour pass from the state funny farm. Agreed?"" Michael Shannon plays this guy and pretty effectively steals the scenes hes in from Winslet and DiCaprio. But they dont have any trouble reclaiming the story as it turns darker. And it gets very very dark by the final fade. The Richard Yates novel written back in 1961 when critiques of the suburbs were themselves revolutionary is by all accounts devastating. But the characters problems seem a bit of-their-own-making in the movie. Are Frank and April really as special as they think they are? Were they ever likely to set out on a road that could be called ""revolutionary""? If not -- and if theyre not say Willy Loman -- why is their misery however expertly brought to cinematic life worth two hours of our time?

"Revolutionary Road | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; revolutionary-road ) Revolutionary Road (United States/United Kingdom 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Since 1997 Titanic fans have been yearning for a re-teaming of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. Revolutionary Road is the opportunity they have awaited but the results may cause as much distress as joy. Directed by Winslets husband Sam Mendes and faithfully adapted by Justin Haythe from the novel by Richard Yates this is the dissection of an imploding marriage and a contemplation about life in surburbia. Its a sad grim movie that asks pointed questions about the compromises we make and the lies we tell in an effort to maintain a sense of equilibrium. And is it more courageous to face up to ones responsibilities or to follow a dream no matter how impossible it may seem? Its western Connecticut in 1955. Frank Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his wife April (Kate Winslet) are entering a dark period in their marriage. Communication between them has broken down and Frank has begun to stray with a co-worker (Zoe Kazan). Hes not happy with his job; he hates the work but needs the money to support April and his two children. Then on his birthday April presents Frank with a plan sell their cozy house on Revolutionary Road and move to Paris. There after leaving behind the ""hopeless emptiness"" of their current life they can begin anew. April can work while Frank takes some time for self-discovery. He is initially enthused by the idea but reality begins to intrude on the fantasy. Frank is offered a major promotion and with it comes more money and more responsibility and April learns that she is pregnant with the couples third child. Suddenly Paris seems like a fairy tale and the union that had been buoyed by a spark of elusive hope crashes and burns. Something about the rot that often lies buried beneath the calm picket fence faASSade of the suburbs appeals to Sam Mendes. He explored the subject in American Beauty and returns to it here. Unlike David Lynch however he doesnat see the suburbs as sinister but merely as life-sapping. Can it be that the so-called ""American Dream"" - a wife children the one-family house - can only be achieved at the price of compromising ones soul and neutering ones creativity? The Wheelers marriage is not destroyed by infidelity or money troubles or communication difficulties (although all are in one way or another symptoms) but by the simple recognition that they are trapped by a sense of ordinariness. They had always believed themselves to be on the cusp of greatness. Now in a flash of acute clarity they recognize that this is untrue. A lot of marriages are like this with many of the fundamental problems not having changed in 50 years. Too many unions begun with hope and optimism degenerate into stale existences with two disconnected individuals living under the same roof. Today many such couples divorce. In 1955 divorce was less common so husbands and wives would argue and find ways to make temporary peace. Its unfair to claim that the happy suburban family was (or is) an illusion but the reality is not as perfect as the illusion. There are challenges to be overcome one of the most prominent of which is the battle between following a dream and bringing home a healthy income. In the Wheelers marriage Frank is the pragmatist and April is the dreamer. Their most searing conflicts are born out of the inherent opposition of those two natures. We see Frank and April at their best and their worst. There are times when we catch glimpses of the people they were before routine repression and the need to conform ground them down. Do they love each other and their children or are they going through the motions trying to present themselves as the perfect family to their ""friends"" and neighbors? Is the decision to move to Paris ever a real plan or is it a perfect fantasy that keeps them afloat until it is no longer possible to face it as more than something distant and ephemeral? One character remarks that Europe will always be there but for Frank and April it has become as far away as the moon. Watching DiCaprio and Winslet its hard to remember that these were the star-crossed lovers in Titanic. Their on-screen relationship here is more real and brittle - not the kind of marriage some viewers would hope for from Rose and Jack. The actors use their chemistry (they are great friends) to forge an underlying sense of affection between Frank and April but the fractures are deep and widening. These are believable flawed people and as in situations like this fault can be generously apportioned. Its possible to understand both sides. Assigning blame is as difficult as determining the solution. Winslets performance is more emotive than DiCaprios but thats because of the nature of her character. Both portrayals are credible and while Winslets performance in The Reader is probably more likely to gain Oscar consideration than her work as April it seems unfair to single out one over the other. Thomas Newmans score deserves mention. The music is simple and subtle and he employs a low-key theme during certain scenes that creates an undertone of dread. It works on a subliminal level increasing the audiences sense that all is not right within the home. Likewise Roger Deakins camerawork shows the picture perfect houses along Revolutionary Road from angles that evoke a sense of nicely designed prisons. Deakins never provides us with an image of suburban bliss. Instead theres a claustrophobic atmosphere even when scenes take place outside. Revolutionary Road is dramatically potent material and although it poses a number of philosophical questions it works best as an unsentimental examination of a marriage in crisis. Because the actors are expert Mendes understands the subject matter and the source material is so meticulous we are left emotionally impacted but without a sense of having been manipulated. Revolutionary Road is a fine motion picture but its not a good choice to lighten a burden or brighten a night. It rewards in the ways that only tragedies can.

With surgical precision Yates brings us deep inside the trapped lives of Frank and April Wheeler a 1950s couple whose youthful dreams have been sacrificed on the altar of suburban comfort conformity and compromise. Frank bored to death by his job working for the Knox business-machines company shores up his ego by seducing a worshipful secretary. April who once harbored dreams of being an actress is now the mother of two children she never really wanted. They drink too much complain about their boring neighbors and lash out at each other in savage verbal combat each finding the other a cruel comedown from the person they thought they once loved.The movie version adapted with scrupulous fidelity by Justin Haythe is directed by Sam Mendes who dissected suburbia once before in his Oscar-winning ""American Beauty."" The unfortunate Wheelers are played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet anyone foolish enough to expect ""Titanic"" redux is in for a rude awakening. What you will see are two very fine actors willing and able to bare their souls. Its almost a shock to see DiCaprio this exposed were used to him hiding behind an accent or a scruffy beard. Here his boyish good looks beginning to thicken he shows us a man whos gotten by on charm and a fantasy that he was destined for higher things. When April desperate to save their marriage proposes that they chuck everything and move to Paris where shell work and hell be free to find his true calling Frank convinces himself hes excited by the plan. But DiCaprio lets us see the fear that haunts Frank that he has no calling that hes really no more special than the bland suburbanites he ridicules over cocktails. April is the more courageous one and the more damaged and Winslet is scarily good as this tough angry housewife. Frank doesnt understand her savage mood swings--is she in todays terminology bipolar?--but Winslet makes every jagged emotional swerve ring true.Theres much to admire about ""Revolutionary Road"" but could any movie take us as far inside these characters as Yatess prose did? Shorn of their backgrounds and their inner monologues all the characters become more generic. The most sizzling scenes occur when Michael Shannon appears. He plays the mentally deranged son of the Wheelers busybody real-estate agent (Kathy Bates) a guy whos had 27 electroshock treatments but who in his brief visits to the couples home cuts through the decorum with his rude truth-telling insights. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week ""Revolutionary Road"" is lushly impeccably mounted--perhaps too much so. Mendes a suberb stage director has an innately theatrical style everything pops off the screen a little bigger and bolder than life but the effect rather than intensifying the emotions calls attention to itself. Instead of losing myself in the story I often felt on the outside looking in appreciating the craftsmanship but one step removed from the agony on display. ""Revolutionary Road"" is impressive but it feels like a classic encased in amber.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

When they meet Frank and April Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio and the fabulous Kate Winslet) have youth beauty energy and hopes of setting the world on fire. Frank is heading for the top of the business world. April is an actress aiming for stardom. By the time theyre 30 hes stuck in a dead-end job in the office where his father worked before him and shes trapped in a suburban house with two kids running vacuums and baking cakes. This is a model couple in the same 1950s time warp as The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit and TVs captivating Mad Men--two Norman Rockwell subjects posing for a Saturday Evening Post cover who bought the American cliche that marrying young owning a house commuting to work every day and supporting a family somehow equals success and fulfillment. The question posed in Richard Yates groundbreaking 1961 novel and in Justin Haythes reverently adapted screenplay is deceptively simple Once you dig the hole how do you get out? Taking inventory of their mortgaged lives Frank and April decide to trade in dull drudgery for bold and fearless stimulation move to Paris and start over again. Both discover its not easy to jump-start a dead battery. Frank accepts a job promotion April plunges into the depression of a third unplanned pregnancy. Truths come spewing out like poisoned plosives. They turn into hollow empty Polaroids of their former selves. They fight they make up they say cruel and withering things they apologize they settle for unwanted responsibilities and compromise while grown-up pragmatism heads south destined for a tragic collision with a brick wall. Because the script and the actors are so appealing you care about these people--so much in fact that the chill of impending doom that rustles across your skin when you sense the coming despair is inevitable. Once again its not what happens that penetrates the emotions in Revolutionary Road. Its a film about feelings disappointments desperation and hollow dreams. You go away asking unavoidable questions about relationships in a changing world like how do you pretend to enjoy the worst kind of surface happiness without betraying the dormant joy that once lit the best of your inner self? How in lifes detours do you stay the best of lovers and yet be the best of friends? The unflinchingly honest Winslet-DiCaprio team illuminates with clarity and precision each mood swing of two people who start out thinking theyll be special and wonderful until life gets in the way; theyre empowered by a captivating supporting cast that includes Kathy Bates as the Chatty Cathy realtor who sells them their ticket to suburban hell and Michael Shannon as her schizophrenic son who has learned to lay his disillusionment on the table without pretense like a frozen turkey the cook forgot to defrost. Layer after layer unpeels rendering the viewer paralyzed with sympathy and loss yet invigorated by the superior artistry of it all. Revolutionary Road a title that symbolizes the downward slope of American idealism--from the grounded thinking of the 18th-century revolution to the second-rate materialism of 20th-century ""progress""--is a profound intelligent and deeply heartfelt work that raises the bar of filmmaking to exhilarating heights of greatness. rreedobserver.com Comment Filed under David Shannon Kate Winslet Kathy Bates Leonardo DiCaprio movie On the Town Revolutionary Road Sam Mendes Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Pussy Riot On Their Provocative Donald Trump-Inspired Art Installation Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture No Alarms No Surprises Why Buying Concert Tickets Is a Rigged System Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://www.observer.com/2008/o2/love-asunder,200,revolutionaryroad30,revolutionaryroad,observer

By David Denby Kate Winslet on the set.   Credit Photograph by Brigitte Lacombe It has become clearer than ever that the movie year is divided into two parts. Theres the first nine months which are filled it seems with big-audience digital spectacles about men who fly animated movies about indignant handheld devices and chatty rodents and all-male comedies about virgins lost in a condom factory. And then theres the Oscar-focussed final three months of the year which are devoted to movies about failure abjection death and the Holocaust most of them starring Kate Winslet or Cate Blanchett. ""Revolutionary Road"" from the celebrated Richard Yates novel of 1961 is one of the latter. It is honorably and brutally unnerving. Yet it may suffer as only an awards-season movie can from the illusion that pain and art are the same thing. The movie is set a half century ago--not in the actual nineteen-fifties but in the semi-mythical fifties of John Cheever Sloan Wilson and many other writers as well as Yates a time in which the orderly bedroom communities of New York and Connecticut were mourned as the national emblem of disillusionment and spiritual decline. Sam Mendes adapting Yatess book with the English screenwriter and novelist Justin Haythe has been in this suburban wasteland before in 1999 with ""American Beauty."" That movie was all stylized red and black surfaces. This time Mendes pushes the signature look of the fifties commuters in identical gray suits and hats pour like lava through Grand Central Terminal and settle to work in vast open floors with shaded glass partitions. Cigarettes are lit and furiously smoked before during and after conversation; Martinis consumed by the bucketful launch anxious bouts of adultery and heartrending quarrels. The movies central male figure is Frank Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio) a handsome young office worker with neatly combed light-brown hair and crisp white shirts. Several years earlier at a party Frank had spied a girl named April (Kate Winslet) a stunner with a long back and golden tresses; the hungry way they looked each other over on that occasion is meant to summarize for us the hopefulness and the erotic splendor of their early years together. The movie like the novel picks up with them in 1955 when they are living in a small agreeable house in Connecticut with their two children. April who wanted to be an actress has failed in that ambition and Frank is lazily and contemptuously working for the same business-machine manufacturer in Manhattan that his father had worked for. At the same time the Wheelers in revolt against the suburbs against conformity against playing it safe believe that they are marked for some extraordinary destiny. Somehow they will escape. As a couple they are the American descendants of Henry Jamess melancholy Londoner John Marcher from the novella ""The Beast in the Jungle"" a man who spends years preparing for the special fate that hes sure will spring at him from the wilds of life. The movie is driven however not by the hope of liberation but by a tense looming sense of disaster and part of our fascinated but fearful response to it is created by the sense that April and Frank are never at ease with each other. In the past Winslet has played American women without straining but this time she enunciates with laborious precision--you can see her propelling vowels and consonants like smoke rings. She and Mendes (her offscreen husband) have worked out a conception of April as a will-driven semi-hysterical female defined solely by her relationship with Frank. Forcing herself to extremes April is either electrified by her husband (""Youre the most beautiful thing in the world--a man"") or disgusted by him; she will turn him into a god or destroy him and Winslet keeps her back rigid her shoulders high her jaw set. DiCaprio by turns cocky supplicating and enraged gets the externals right but he seems a little afraid of revealing the depths of Franks shallowness. Frank is a liar an adulterer and a compromiser who betrays himself as much as his wife but DiCaprio projects a natural heroic sweetness--its in his movie-star genes--which in this case is at odds with the character hes playing. If you think of Paul Newmans acid moments in ""The Hustler"" and ""Hud"" you can imagine how the role might have been done. Henry Jamess antihero discovers his fate he is to be ""the man of his time the man to whom nothing on earth was to have happened"" an ironic catastrophe. Marcher suffers from an insufficiency of sexuality of vital spirit which is hardly the Wheelers problem but like him they have no idea what to do with themselves. Now the Wheelers dilemma is grounds for pathos or possibly turned a different way for satire but is it grounds for tragedy? The story works toward a gruesomely unhappy ending but I cant escape the feeling that both creator and re-creator have trapped an American couple in a grim overly mechanistic system of dead ends that reflects the artists own ambitions and temperaments rather than some stinging truth about American incapacity. Theres a sourness a relentlessness about the movie which borders on misanthropy. In both the social and the personal scenes the conversational tone veers between idiotic pleasantries and fathomless bile with nothing in between. Were middle-class people in the fifties really so stunted? The only character who consistently speaks with intelligence turns out to be not only crazy but destructive. (Hes played in a brilliant virtuoso turn by the scary-looking Michael Shannon.) By schematizing the books relationships and by cutting away Yatess extraordinary precision psychological nuance and eloquent sorrows Mendes has I think unwittingly revealed something unconvincing about the material. Just two years after Yatess book came out Betty Friedan published ""The Feminine Mystique"" whose resonant starting point is the puzzling misery felt by suburban housewives like April--women allegedly living the American Dream complete with wage-earning husband multiple children and good china. It would be inane to fault Richard Yates for not possessing an explicitly feminist consciousness but he never suggests that April suffers from even the slightest social constriction and neither does Mendes. April is isolated in her own neuroses and Winslet goes all the way into the kind of strident rage that is fuelled by excess; DiCaprio once baited stays with her. In scene after scene the two actors tear away at each other sometimes in tight closeup. Mendes is a man of the theatre and this movie I suppose is like a strong Broadway drama--clenched explosive and perhaps cathartic. But I dont think the turmoil of ""Revolutionary Road"" should be confused with movie art. In ""Gran Torino"" Clint Eastwood appears (symbolically) as the last white man in America guarding what might be called the last American car--an Army-green 1972 Ford Gran Torino lovingly preserved in a garage in run-down Highland Park just outside Detroit. The movie directed by Eastwood and written by Nick Schenk is set in the present when a Korean War hero and longtime Ford automotive worker Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) now a retired father of two grown sons his wife recently dead finds himself living next door to Hmong immigrants whom he towers over and bullies. The Hmong are the hill people of Thailand Laos and Vietnam who fought on the American side in Vietnam; some of them immigrated to the United States and they work hard but Walt calls them ""gooks"" and ""slopes"" and other bitterly pronounced tags from the rich American vocabulary of abuse. When young Thao (Bee Vang) from next door tries to steal the sacred Gran Torino Walt becomes enmeshed with the boys family first as antagonist and then gradually as fierce protector--so fierce that he gets caught up in the neighborhood gang wars with their escalating back-and-forth of beatings rapes and shoot-outs. Walt is meant to be the kind of fearless American whose strength is inseparable from his blighted vision of the world. He is obsessed with turf with right and wrong narrowly defined with male codes male lingo. The movie was not written for Eastwood but it still seems to be all about him--his past characters his myth his old role as a dispenser of raw justice. Growling and muttering Eastwood appears to be offering a satirical critique this hoarse-voiced glaring absurdly nasty old man is what Dirty Harry might have become. The movie which Eastwood directed with his usual vigor has plenty of violent scenes but its mostly a rueful comedy of enlightenment by degrees Walt comes to admire his neighbors; he realizes that he has more in common with their quiet self-discipline than with the hollow consumerism of his sons and their grasping kids. Walts final acts in the neighborhood struggles come as a shock but in retrospect they make perfect sense as Eastwoods personal renunciation of vengeance and also as a kind of down payment on an altered American future. The day-to-day difficulties and occasional exhilarations of urban multi-ethnic education have never been dramatized with half the power or the humor that the director Laurent Cantet (""Time Out"") brings to them in ""The Class."" The movie which won the Palme dOr at Cannes this year stars an actual teacher Francois Begaudeau who in 2006 published a book chronicling a year in the Paris public school where he teaches French. Cantet and Begaudeau along with Robin Campillo condensed and reshaped the material into a two-hour drama centering on the teacher and a small number of middle-school students (all played by real students though not the same ones Begaudeau wrote about). Begaudeau in his thirties is handsome lean and quick with a strong voice; the slouching or rowdy kids are mostly of African or Caribbean descent--though many of them were born in France they are still outsiders and rightfully touchy about it. Some of them are resistant to education which disrupts the pleasures of adolescence but Begaudeau goes after them aggressively challenging correcting teasing criticizing and they are alive to him and come back hard. Begaudeau a brave and candid man dramatizes his own failures as when he offhandedly compares some insolent girls to ""skanks"" and nearly starts a rebellion. He finds himself in the contradictory position of liberal authority he demands that the students not mope around in a recessive funk and instead become their authentic selves. But then empowered by his attention they challenge his control of the class. The climax of the movie is a wrenching episode in which a boy from Mali throws a tantrum and the school given its self-defining rules has to decide whether to expel him even though expulsion will probably send him back to Africa. In all ""The Class"" is a prime document of French post-colonial blues though its relevance to American urban education could not be any greater if it had been made in the Bronx or Trenton or South Los Angeles. I would be surprised if this brilliant and touching film didnt become required viewing for teachers all over the United States. Everyone else should see it as well--its a wonderful movie.

""Revolutionary Road"" is a very good bigscreen adaptation of an outstanding American novel -- faithful intelligent admirably acted superbly shot. It also offers a near-perfect case study of the ways in which film is incapable of capturing certain crucial literary qualities in this case the very things that elevate the book from being a merely insightful study of a deteriorating marriage into a remarkable one. Sam Mendes fourth feature reps what many people look for in the realm of serious grown-up thoughtful film fare and led by the powerful performances of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet teaming for the first time since ""Titanic"" Paramount Vantage should be able to push this sad tale to a potent commercial career among discriminating audiences. In addition to being compared with Richard Yates 1961 novel which thwarted previous aspiring adapters and has enjoyed a persistent following over the years the film will conjure up two other comparisons -- to the TV series ""Mad Men"" which is set in the same general period and shares a focus on hard-smoking hard-drinking New York commuters and their women and Mendes own ""American Beauty"" a similarly critical but far more theatrical look at the underside of the suburban American dream. Screenplay by Justin Haythe (""The Clearing"") scrupulously adheres to the structure personalities perspectives and much of the dialogue of the novel as it examines the heartbreaking schism in the relationship between Frank and April Wheeler (DiCaprio and Winslet) a strikingly handsome couple who buy into the postwar convention of abandoning the city and raising two kids in a picture-perfect Connecticut suburb while Frank commutes to his unchallenging job at a large business-machines corporation in Manhattan. Stuck at home and with the far more acute set of emotional antennae April is the first to identify the ""trap"" of their lives and soon proposes they chuck it all and move to Paris where she proposes to support the family while Frank endeavors to find himself. ""This is our one chance"" April stresses and it doesnt take long for Frank who would seem to have a latent bohemian in him to agree. Questioned as to why theyd want to make such a drastic move Frank replies with a glancing hint of ironic humor ""Were running from the hopeless emptiness of the life here."" Literature movies and social commentary have all been down this road many times before stressing the conformism of 50s upper-middle-class life the emotional sterility of the suburbs the hypocrisy of attitudes the sexism et al. What keeps all these too routinely accepted views safely in the background here is the stinging emotional truth that courses through the novel and to a significant extent the film thanks especially to the electric fully invested performances by the two leads. Frank and April are like a 20-years-younger George and Martha in ""Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" who have yet to achieve an unstated equilibrium in their epic tug of war. One youthful advantage they still enjoy is a simmering amorous relationship. Sad to say this doesnt prevent Frank from having an office fling with a very available secretary Maureen (Zoe Kazan) as a 30th birthday present to himself. Incidental as the interlude is the brief affair serves as a cogent illustration of how the film conveys only a fraction of the nuances and layers of the book. In the film it appears Frank makes his move on an almost arbitrary impulse and hes made to look bad in the typically chauvinistic way he uses his superior position to seduce a powerless young woman. On the page the two already have a history marked by a long mutual flirtation and Maureen is described as sexier and less frumpy than the woman who turns up onscreen. Frank may be a cad either way but in the novel his cheating involves an array of ambiguous feelings on both sides -- anticipation hesitation delight remorse Franks subsequent temptation to confess -- while in the film it registers only one meaning naughty boy. With one notable exception toward the end Haythe and Mendes capture the primal emotional and thematic points of the book as they try to find a cinematic way to express the subtext of Yates prose which most distinguishes itself through the precise expressions of minute changes in emotion attitude and thought -- what might he say what should she say what does he feel whats she really thinking how did he and she react at the same moment? Even when the dramatic temperature is cranked up to high the pictures underpinnings seem only partly present to the point where one suspects that what its reaching for dramatically might be all but unattainable -- perhaps approachable only by Pinter at his peak. That said ""Revolutionary Road"" is constantly engrossing as it successfully engages the Wheelers yearning to rescue themselves from their decorous socially acceptable oblivion just as it clearly defines how the ""trap"" is stronger than they are. The rows tender moments and downtime in between are fully inhabited and powerfully charged by DiCaprio and Winslet. For his part DiCaprio often achieves the kind of double register the film as a whole less consistently captures as he indicates Franks thought process in the split second before he decides what to say. At certain moments the conjoined cerebral and emotional aspects of his characterization summon the spirit of Jack Nicholsons breakthrough performances around the time of ""Five Easy Pieces."" Winslets perf is less surprising perhaps if only because she has shown tremendous range throughout her career. April is a difficult role in that her mood changes sometimes seem inexplicable but the thesp makes them all seem genuine which resonates with Franks occasional hints that shes possibly in need of psychiatric help. Winslets starkly etched April is steely strong and brittle capable of great highs and lows as well as massive uncertainty. Pics startling supporting turn comes from Michael Shannon whos mesmerizing as the clinically insane son of local realtor and busybody Helen Givings (Kathy Bates). Hes a loony who is able to tell the truth about the Wheelers that everyone else so politely avoids; when Shannon is onscreen its impossible to watch anyone else. The limited roster of supporting players has been expertly cast and the thesps deliver accordingly notably Bates Richard Easton as her conveniently hard-of-hearing husband and David Harbour and Kathryn Hahn as the Wheelers small-horizons neighbors. Kristi Zeas production design meshes with location work in Connecticut and Gotham to produce a vivid but unstressed sense of 1955. As ever cinematographer Roger Deakins makes everyone -- the designers actors director gardener manicurist you name it -- look even better than they do on their own. Thomas Newmans score defined as it is by very simple three-note progressions plays into the desired mood but grows repetitive.
