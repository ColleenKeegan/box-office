Unfortunately producing the sequel has proven considerably more problematic. Spoofing the ""Scream"" movies was a great concept ""Scary Movie"" became a magnet for hordes of fans. Unfortunately producing the sequel has proven considerably more problematic. Lensing at breakneck speed to continue the big mo of last summers sleeper blockbuster helmer Keenen Ivory Wayans was still in production up until mere weeks ago for now-famous scenes in which Marlon Brando was replaced by James Woods. Effort is technically and comedically strained by the demands of its special effects-filled haunted house setting. Worse the need to top the first pics outlandish stunts is ghoulishly unfulfilled and terribly ironic Unlike the first ""Scream"" sequel this one hardly surpasses the original. Pic wont shake off this summers haunting B.O. pattern of 50%-plus drop-offs after huge opening week numbers though the final tally will probably encourage Dimension to launch -- perhaps with a bit more patience this time -- a third edition. As with the first ""Scary Movie"" this is the brainchild of Wayans brothers Keenen Shawn and Marlon and once again there is an army of co-writers and producers. What also remains constant is a gleeful ability to poke fun at any sacred cow (this time the disabled) and a nearly supernatural way of spinning the latest pop culture references on their heads. Some are astoundingly new Black hip-hop style is taught to a curious white girl a la ""Save the Last Dance""; Wilson from ""Castaway"" appears in the logo art; Anne Robinsons chilly ""Weakest Link"" dismissal is uttered by a foul-mouthed parrot; and Marlons head is opened up in a way that would make even Hannibal Lecter chuckle. An eight-minute prologue though travels back two decades for its jokes to ""The Exorcist"" in which Woods brazenly skewers the title character Andy Richter provides a dazed needling of Father Karras Veronica Cartwright in the Ellen Burstyn role briefly leads a chorus of ""Shake Ya Ass"" and the barely recognizable Natasha Lyonne urinates cusses head-spins and pukes as Megan. Nothing else in the movie is as funny as this dead-on send-up which hits its gross peak with a three-way war of projectile pea-soup vomiting. Opening suggests that the sequel is going to go wilder and crazier than before but it never happens. A year later back from the dead with no explanation are he-doesnt-know-hes gay Ray (Shawn Wayans) blunt-smoking Shorty (Marlon Wayans) and Rays g.f. Brenda (Regina Hall). Goody-good Cindy (Anna Faris) who survived first pic joins her pals and others for a ""mick"" psychology class led by a professor (Tim Curry) and sidekick Dwight (David Cross) a wheelchair-bound techie with a complex about anyone assisting him. With shades of ""The Haunting"" ""House on Haunted Hill"" and even ""The Ghost and Mr. Chicken"" the professor invites his pupils to join him for a weekend in Hell House. Weirder than the professor and by far more irritating is the estates ultra-deformed caretaker named Hanson (Chris Elliott) which is about as dated as the pop culture jokes get. Cindy arrives first pestered by the parrot that fulfills pics R rating all by itself then by Hanson whose bent stubs of fingers go everywhere they shouldnt. Soon after the group arrives Hanson prepares dinner with his hands in an endless skit that has Elliott one of his generations sorriest comics nearly capsizing the movie all by himself. Cindy gets clued in before anyone else to whats spooking Hell House The ghost of the dead owner Mr. Kane (Richard Moll in grayish translucence) is avenging his wifes infidelities by stalking women especially Cindy who looks like Mrs. Kane. All of this is rough prelude for a train of set pieces Ray under a bed with a killer clown Dwight in a wheelchair race with Kanes ghost Brenda getting over on a bad-ass skeleton and Shorty getting rolled into a giant joint by a pot plant that seems to have escaped from ""Little Shop of Horrors."" But through all this as well as a ""Charlies Angels"" action spoof the laugh quotient shrinks faster than the Nasdaq index in 2000. The surprise of discovery in the first movie is gone and its not helped by the Wayanses habit of repeating gags. Except for Elliott the thesps work as a good-natured unit with Cross carrying more screen time than anyone might expect. Still the strong comic sense and energy of Woods and Co. in the prologue is badly missed once the poltergeists take over. Sequels heftier budget purchased more effects but theyre poor-cousin knockoffs of previous horror movies and like the project as a whole none surpass the extreme stunts of last years edition. Steven Bernsteins lensing forgets to shift out of the over-lit style endemic to gross-out comedy for a sufficiently darker look later on. Music selections are surprisingly bland.

"washingtonpost.com Entertainment Guide Main Page Movies Music Restaurants Nightlife Museums/Galleries Theater/Dance Love Life In Store Outdoors/Fitness  Style  Comics  Crosswords  Horoscopes  Books  Travel  Weather  Traffic  TV Listings Scarier and Funnier Too By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 6 2001 James Woods and Natasha Lyonne spoof ""The Exorcist"" in ""Scary Movie 2."" (Photo by Linda R. Chen/Dimension Films) Whats the scariest thing about ""Scary Movie 2"" the sequel to the Wayans brothers hit parody of horror movies from last year?The list of writers (seven) is longer than the list of co-stars (six). In addition to siblings Shawn Marlon and Craig Wayans - Craig? Where did he come from? - four other unrelated scribes are credited with contributing jokes to the comedic stew which is actually better and funnier than the original.Now wait a minute. We seem to recall that you hated the original.Um yeah I did. But I hated this one less. To tell the truth I didnt hate it at all. But thats mainly because director Keenen Ivory Wayans here manages to keep pretty much on target in ways he wasnt able to do in ""SM1"" which took too many potshots at things that have nothing to do with horror movies. In other words he aims most of his satiric buckshot at scary movies and not at pop culture in general. Okay the movie does contain an allusion or two to ""Charlies Angels"" Nike commercials and filmmaker John Woos trademark white doves but by and large it sticks to making fun of demonic possession (in a prologue sendup of ""The Exorcist"" featuring James Woods Andy Richter and Natasha Lyonne); ghosts (in a plot lifted wholesale from ""The House on Haunted Hill"" and ""The Haunting""); and freakishly deformed handymen.Speaking of which Chris Elliott is hysterical as Hanson the leering claw-armed caretaker of the Gothic mansion into whose cobwebbed halls a group of college kids have been recruited for a scientific study of insomnia. Returning from the original actors Shawn and Marlon Wayans Anna Faris and Regina Hall along with Chris Masterson of ""Malcolm in the Middle"" and the buxom pillow-lipped Kathleen Robertson of ""Beverly Hills 90210"" play the oversexed victims-in-waiting.As the lip-smacking sleep researcher known only as The Professor Tim Curry is delightfully lubricious and as his wheelchair-bound and badly-combed-over assistant Dwight the ever-acerbic David Cross of ""Mr. Show With Bob and David"" fame is eminently watchable. Which brings me to the second thing I liked about this movie the cast. No not the main cast. Theyre fine but not the point really.When a movie does as well as ""SM1"" did (making double its 19 million budget in the opening weekend alone) everybody and his brother wants to jump on board the sequel and ""SM2"" is no exception. Okay so Tori Spelling is no Meryl Streep but I did get a kick out of watching the game starlet pleasure a blob of sexually aroused ectoplasm in her role as a grave-robbing gold digger.Thats right ""Scary Movie 2"" is no more highbrow than its precursor. If anything the gross-out factor has been ratcheted up a notch to keep pace with the competition. Still its a lot more tightly focused than the first outing and for fans of the demented comedy of Elliott and Cross or the thespian chops of Woods (a last-minute replacement for an ailing Marlon Brando) its worth putting up with humor thats the filmic equivalent of a big spit-soaked raspberry.""Scary Movie 2"" (R 83 minutes) - Contains obscenity projectile vomiting and other bodily emissions comic fixation on body parts slapstick violence and sex with the living the dead and the undead.

USATODAY.com - Scary Movie 2 fails to enthrall Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 07/06/2001 - Updated 0425 PM ET Scary Movie 2 fails to enthrallBy Mike Clark USA TODAY Scary Movie 2 (out of four) Stars Shawn Wayans Marlon Wayans Tori Spelling Anna FarisDirector Keenan Ivory WayansDistributor Dimension Films Rating R for strong sexual and gross humor graphic language and some drug content One of the first gags in the movie involves a priest exorcising intestinal demons from his bowels. One of the last involves flying bird droppings. Scat while you can. This sequel to last Julys hit was reportedly cobbled together in an eleventh-hour editing frenzy to ensure huge box office over a holiday-week opening. Comedies that spoof other movies and do nothing else ceased seeming clever years ago but at least the best of the lot have featured Leslie Nielsen. Here its mostly miss-and-miss scenes involving a lot of nondescript young actors. Read more Video Scary Movie 2 trailer Stories Scary Movie 2 hones wit on horror classics Many of the gags involve physical and verbal assaults on the groups punching bag Cindy (Anna Faris) and they eventually grow discomforting. Others involve the looking-for-action efforts of gay Ray (Shawn Wayans brother of Scary director Keenen Ivory) as he walks around with a bar of soap to drop. The only actors here of note are James Woods (as the priest with diarrhea) and Tim Curry as a professor/villain orchestrating a weekend right out of The Haunting for the survivors of all the murderous mayhem in the original Scary. Given that the old dark house movie premise extends all the way back to er The Old Dark House (1932) this isnt exactly the most pressing material in need of satirical screen treatment. And if you took out all the jokes about bodily fluids the movie could run five minutes instead of 83 and we could all go home.

"CNN.com - Review Scary Movie 2 frighteningly bad - July 4 2001 MAIN PAGE WORLD U.S. WEATHER BUSINESS SPORTS POLITICS LAW SCI-TECH SPACE HEALTH ENTERTAINMENT TRAVEL EDUCATION IN-DEPTH QUICK NEWS LOCAL COMMUNITY MULTIMEDIA E-MAIL SERVICES CNNtoGO ABOUT US CNN TV whats on show transcripts CNN Headline News CNN International askCNN EDITIONS CNN.com Asia CNN.com Europe set your edition Languages --------- Time Inc. --------- Time.com People Fortune EW In the toilet Review Scary Movie 2 frighteningly bad ""Scary Movie 2"" includes scenes that spoof the supernatural and college life -- both poorly By Paul ClintonCNN Reviewer (CNN) -- Last years surprise summer hit was ""Scary Movie."" It was an idiotic mindless spoof of teen-age slasher movies like ""Friday The 13th"" (1980) or ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" (1984) -- movies which themselves were inherently idiotic mindless spoofs of actual scary movies such as ""Psycho"" (1960) and ""Carrie"" (1976). Nevertheless this parody of a parody made 157 million at the box office. Therefore before you could scream ""Dont go into that dark house alone you crazy fool"" a sequel ""Scary Movie 2"" has been made. All of which once again proves that P.T. Barnum knew what he was talking about when he said ""A sucker is born every minute."" Writer/director Keenen Ivory Wayans shows hes still the high priest of low- brow humor with ""Scary 2."" Along with his acting/writing/producing brothers Shawn and Marlon Wayans wades back into the land of toilet humor this time via the route of spoofing another very broad film genre the world of the supernatural.

"washingtonpost.com Entertainment Guide Main Page Movies Music Restaurants Nightlife Museums/Galleries Theater/Dance Love Life In Store Outdoors/Fitness  Style  Comics  Crosswords  Horoscopes  Books  Travel  Weather  Traffic  TV Listings Scary 2 Spoof Is Just One Big Yuck By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday July 4 2001 James Woods and Natasha Lyonnes parody gets rare laughs in an otherwise hellish movie. (Linda R. Chen/Dimension Films) Nothing succeeds like abscess and ""Scary Movie 2"" is a pocket of infection on the skin of the American body cultural.Ugh. Ew. Please. Did I really write a piece within the week in which I evoked the late great Jack Lemmon and his director the great but not yet late Billy Wilder (""Some Like It Hot"" ""The Apartment"")? And Im now writing a piece about ""Scary Movie 2""? Somehow it doesnt seem right. You might say that the line between Wilders work and Keenen Ivory Wayanss is straight and youd be right. Only its straight down into the gutter and the toilet.Yes Wayanss sequel starring his two brothers and a sad list of other unfortunates has some laughs. Notably a parody of ""The Exorcist"" in which a game James Woods sends up Max von Sydow Andy Richter does his version of Jason Miller and Veronica Cartwright plays a shadow of Ellen Burstyn. Its funny until all these folks start projectile vomiting on each other. It becomes ""A Perfect Storm"" with pea soup and I will never ever no way nohow taste pea soup again in my life.Then we get to the credits and learn that the ""Exorcist"" parody has nothing whatsoever to do with the movie itself which turns into a lame parody of the kinds of ghost movies that havent been popular in years as the failure of the 1999 remake of ""The Haunting"" should have made clear. Then unaccountably it segues into a lame spin on ""Charlies Angels.""But the Wayans brothers dont let the lack of a good idea stop them. While the original ""Scary Movie"" - a tone-perfect sendup of violent teen slasher films - was profane blasphemous grotesque hostile gross infantile and ridiculous it was also funny. That cant be said for ""2"" which just sits up there coagulating suppurating leaking oxygen through its sucking chest wound and generally stinking up the joint.As the movie has it evil professor Tim Curry convenes a weekend at an old mansion because he believes that his students have within them the capacity to contact the spirits of the dead and also because he wants to watch the girls take showers over the secret closed-circuit TV system.The usual suspects include the Wayans brothers Marlon and Shawn as respectively pot-debilitated and gay students; Anna Faris as a goody-good Chris Masterson as a juvenile Regina Hall as the token black woman the beauteous and gifted Tori Spelling as a Jewish princess with scraggy toenails.Chris Elliott plays the mansion caretaker a walking pimple with a hand thats more like a toxin-mutated starfish than anything which hes always dunking in food or putting up his nose. That character who lacks wit humor humanity wisdom and exists only to provide flatulence of both gassy and intellectual sorts is a disgrace. If it were funny maybe but what on earth has happened to this guy?Theres no answer to that one. The more interesting question is What has happened to us since the great age of Wilder? Unfortunately theres no answer to that one either.""Scary Movie 2"" (88 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for rudimentary gross-out humor.

""Scary Movie 2"" left to right Tori Spelling Kathleen Robertson Chris Elliott Marlon Wayans and Regina Hall. Photo HANDOUT An exorcise in tedium / Without a trend to spoof Scary Movie 2 is just a shapeless terror 1 / 1 Back to Gallery SCARY MOVIE 2 Starring Anna Faris Marlon Wayans and Shawn Wayans. Directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans. (R. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) When last we left the Wayanses -- as a film-spoof family -- they were on top of the world. It was last summer and the pop n horror parody ""Scary Movie"" was in addition to being lucrative smarter than people admitted it was. More than just a spoof ""Scary Movie"" took an Afro pick and a machete to pop-trend spotting puffing it up and then hacking away achieving a movie milestone at the same time -- it was the first picture to demonstrate the way black people see white people in movies. More hysterically ""Scary Movie"" -- directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans from a script co-written by Shawn and Marlon -- took black America through an even more rigorous set of funhouse mirrors. A year later the dimmer ""Scary Movie 2"" opens on the fumes of that same smirking interracial dream. A cast of cognac-swilling high-society types (including Veronica Cartwright and a bewigged Andy Richter) stand around a piano mewling like Stephen Sondheim alley cats. The show tunes stop and they slip into a round of Mystikals ""Shake Ya Ass."" Its the smartest funniest lick in ""Scary Movie 2"" which soon rips into an ""Exorcist"" parody starring an unrecognizable Natasha Lyonne as the afflicted and in a disturbing ""special appearance"" James Woods as the vulgarized incarnation of Max von Sydows Father Merrin. Keenen Ivory doesnt direct the movie so much as contain the insanity he and his brothers crank out. ""Crank"" is a choice word given that the up-to-the- minute gags know what you did last summer and last winter too Check out the dis of ""Save the Last Dances"" ""how-to-be-urban"" shtick. Along with Anna Faris the raunch and ""throw a bunch of jokes at the wall and hope some stick"" m.o. return way diminished from the original. ""Scary Movie"" was a cross-racial pop orgy that wanted to exploit exploitation itself as a garden-variety gross-out flick crammed into the structure of a ""Scream"" picture. But whereas the first movie had a trend to spoof the sequel doesnt which shows in its mishmash approach -- half laugh riot half clothesline of not-ready-for-prime-time tangents. Like its predecessor ""Scary Movie 2"" is built for parody Basically the head of ""The Haunting"" is stitched onto the neck of a rank episode of ""Scooby Doo."" Faris and college crew (Shawn Marlon Regina Hall Christopher Masterson and ""90210"" sorority sisters Tori Spelling and Kathleen Robertson) head up to the mansion where the ""Exorcist"" incident went down. Theyve agreed to be part of an ""insomnia experiment"" by David Cross and Tim Curry. Curry seems to have been in most of the movies mocked here (""Charlies Angels"" ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show""). Chris Elliott as a version of ""Rockys"" Riff Raff does his most unwatchable mugging yet. Spelling on the other hand cant get a decent self-parody scene to save her life which makes her participation scarier than the movie shes in. ""Scary 2"" is so remarkably shapeless you can imagine Shawn and Marlon hashing out scenes between presenters at last years MTV Video Music Awards. Marlon reprises his role as a pot enthusiast and the movie is just as psyched to exist in a cloud of bong smoke. Cobbled together from the scraps of old gags ""Scary 2"" is a pure Frankenstein flick -- ugly profane terror-inducing clumsy nasty desperate stupid contemptible horny and brought to life by schlocky shoddy science and an electric wish to prove that its makers still matter. This movie contains sex gross-out humor and raw language.

"Scary Movie 2 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; scary-movie-2 ) Scary Movie 2 (United States 2001) A movie review by James Berardinelli Uninspired. Pointless. Lifeless. Obligatory. Those are a few of the adjectives that can be used to describe Keenen Ivory Wayans Scary Movie 2 the profit-driven sequel to the surprise 2000 hit Scary Movie. Like far too many follow-up motion pictures Scary Movie 2 exists only because its predecessor made a lot of money. Miramax/Dimension seeing  decided that there was no better way to plunder the market than to dump another Scary Movie into theaters and hope that the name alone would attract enough of an audience for the quickie production to break into the black. In fact name recognition is about the only thing Scary Movie 2 has going for it - aside from a few genuinely funny gags this motion picture represents an 80-minute exercise into tedium that does little more than re-hash the first outing. The original Scary Movie was a lively outrageous spoof of horror flicks in general and Scream in particular. If it ran out of momentum in the last half hour that was a reasonable price to pay for such an entertaining skewering of a genre. Scary Movie 2 tries with minimal success to mine the same territory but the vein has long since been tapped out. So instead of getting something fresh and funny we are saddled with a turkey whose leaden desperation in trying to get us to laugh is obvious. Gone are the energy and the edgy flamboyance. Scary Movie 2 is just as crude and lewd as its predecessor but this time around the ""shocking"" sexual and scatological humor seems prefabricated rather than spontaneous. Nearly every gross moment is too easily predicted and predictability is the death of rapid-fire shock comedy. Having hacked Scream to death Wayans (with help from seven credited screenwriters including his brothers) sets his sights on The Haunting. This choice presents an immediate problem since its infinitely more difficult to lampoon a bad movie than it is a good one. The Haunting is in many ways a self-parody making Scary Movie 2 redundant. Nevertheless Wayans soldiers on directing the workmanlike script. The surviving characters from the first movie - pretty Cindy (Anna Faris) sexually ambivalent jock Ray (Shawn Wayans) perpetually stoned Shorty (Marlon Wayans) and perky Brenda (Regina Hall) along with a few newcomers are brought to a haunted house for sleep deprivation experiments conducted by an unbalanced college professor (Tim Curry who has made a career out of playing demented characters). Of course the horny sprits inhabiting the mansion get out of control and end up chasing after Cindy who looks just like the long-lost true love of the head honcho ghost. To Wayans credit the movie isnt a complete bust. In fact it starts out strongly with a devilishly funny parody of The Exorcist. (It really has nothing to do with the rest of the film but who cares?) James Woods filling in for Marlon Brando (who was unable to play the role due to illness) deadpans the part of the exorcist who has a unique solution to the problem of a girl who is possessed. Aside from The Exorcist spoof there are other successful bits and pieces - a cat fight (I wish the animals in Cats and Dogs showed this kind of tenacity) a scene in which the tables are turned on a bogeyman under a bed and a brief Charlies Angels take-off. Far less effective are other satirical vignettes such as the lampooning of the latest round of Nike basketball commercials or the references to Hollow Man What Lies Beneath and other recent horror films. Scary Movie 2 was put together in a very short time with Dimension unwilling to delay the release date and this may have contributed to the films rushed sloppy feel. The number of cameos is surprisingly lean. James Woods is one of the few recognizable faces to grace the screen and he wasnt Wayans first choice for the role. (I kept imagining how Brando would have played some of the scenes.) Unfortunately the elements of Scary Movie 2 that work are dwarfed by those that fail. The picture is characterized by long laugh-less stretches - death to a film virtually devoid of plot and characterization. As was true of Airplane and The Naked Gun Scary Movie was a one-shot deal. It can not effectively be reconstituted or appended to. Like Blair Witch 2 this sequel bears the obvious stench of crass commercialism ungilded by pious mouthings of a ""creative vision."" Once the well is dry further attempts to bring up water yield only mud. One needs look no further than Scary Movie 2 to see the truth of that statement.
