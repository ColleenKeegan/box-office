Pic cements the Rocks status as a contempo action hero with a bigscreen future. Watch for opening to lay the smackdown on competition followed by solid mid-range or better B.O. Pity the poor soul who has to stand shirtless next to the Rock but such is the fate of Seann William Scott in ""The Rundown."" The improbably appealing duo forms the core of this Amazon-set action-adventure caper that is at once more ear-splitting and entertaining than it has the right to be. Pic effectively furthers Universals collaboration after ""The Scorpion King"" with the former WWF star and it cements the Rocks status as a contempo action hero with a bigscreen future. Watch for its opening to lay the smackdown on the competition followed by solid mid-range or better B.O. In his films so far the former Dwayne Johnson hasnt strayed far from cartoonish material that plays upon his instinctive theatricality and formidable physical abilities. Here hes Beck a ""retrieval expert"" (bounty hunter) facing one last gig before retirement; he longs to open a restaurant. This time out he wears more clothes and gets a meatier role than usual but he also has plenty of combat scenes in which to flaunt his skills. First such fight occurs during an opening sequence in L.A. that establishes tone and shades character Attempting to collect on a pro athletes debt Beck has to outmaneuver an entire squad of offensive linemen. Fed up and roughed up he strikes a deal with his boss Billy Walker (William Lucking) retrieve Walkers son Travis (Scott) from his Amazon travels and buy his own freedom in return. But once in Brazil Beck finds a reluctant quarry -- and a whole lot more. Becks garrulous escort an inexplicably Scottish airplane pilot (Ewen Bremner of ""Trainspotting"") leads him to the fictional town of El Dorado. There a diabolical robber-baron named Hatcher (Christopher Walken) employs Brasilieros under inhumane conditions to mine the land for gold. Teeming with thousands of workers the matte and CGI-enhanced excavation site looks like something out of ""Intolerance."" Gold also motivates archaeology student Travis who seeks a priceless hidden artifact the Gato do Diablo with which he can solidify his own reputation and escape papas repressive control. Ambling into a seedy local tavern Travis enlists the bartender his former g.f. Mariana (Rosario Dawson with wobbly Portuguese accent) to help find it. She has barely agreed when Beck arrives offering Travis a choice return home either voluntarily or by force. Fights are what the Rocks fans want and they wont be disappointed. A half-dozen brawls choreographed by ""Scorpion King"" vet Andy Cheng offer gasp-inducing suspense nimble footwork and wham-bam excitement. Fans will be pleased to see that for the most part it appears the Rock has performed his own stunts. The film exploits its creative license -- particularly in a Butch-and-Sundance-style plummet down a seemingly bottomless ravine from which Beck and Travis emerge unscathed. But Scott and the Rock make such a good team disbelief is willingly suspended. Scotts youthful insolence (perfected as Stiffler in the ""American Pie"" trilogy) sparks with the Rocks glowering heavy; the Rock for his part emits just enough disarming self-irony to keep things fresh. Dialogue as written by R.J. Stewart and James Vanderbilt is sharper and funnier than that of most tired action comedies and the leads deliver their one-liners with zing. Thats not to say the script isnt overpacked with plot points forced crises and deus ex machina moments including the ingestion of toxic fruit a monkey invasion and a brutal encounter with Brazilian rebel forces. Conclusion wraps things up a bit too tidily though it does invite the possibility of a sequel. Pics excesses notwithstanding helmer Peter Berg (""Very Bad Things"") knows whats called for in an action movie and keeps the pacing brisk delivering it all in less than two hours. A thesp himself Berg has managed to offset the dizzying action scenes with a welcome attention to character detail. Though Dawson doesnt do much other than look ravishing others come off better. Bremner supplies goofy comic relief; Walken splendid malevolence. (Its a shame though to see him retread such familiar territory; he should be allowed to counter expectation as in ""Catch Me if You Can""). Production looks handsome with Hawaiis rain forest credibly doubling for the Amazon and the San Gabriel Mountains filling in for El Dorado. (Apparently the idea of shooting in Brazil was scrapped when crew members were held up by armed bandits during a scouting tour.) Tech elements are consistent throughout.

"The Rundown is a Rock opera. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Rundown is a Rock opera. The Rundown is a Rock opera. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 24 2003 501 PM The Rock Opera A schlock hero is born--almost--in The Rundown. By Michael Agger Seann William Scott smells what the Rock is cooking OK we get it. Arnold Schwarzenegger is in politics Sylvester Stallone is burning up the charity golf circuit Steven Seagal is strictly straight to video and Jean-Claude Van Damme is and remains a small guy from Belgium. The time has come for a new action star and the Rock wants to assume the throne. Hes certainly poised having already appeared in two faux-ancient Egypt movies-- The Mummy Returns (2001) and The Scorpion King (2002)--with his wrestling fans turning out in large numbers to watch him run around the desert and body-slam stuff. Now in The Rundown (Universal) he traverses the green jungles of Brazil in his very own star vehicle. Advertisement For those few who remain wrestling virgins the Rocks real name is Dwayne Johnson and his most common in-ring sobriquet is ""The Peoples Champion."" In terms of the sport however his family essentially came over on the Mayflower. His grandfather was the Samoan wrestler High Chief Peter Maivia and his father was Rocky Johnson a beloved grappler during the Superfly Snuka era of the late 70s and early 80s. When it came time for the Rock to enter the ring he started out with a good-guy persona but he became really popular once he started wearing nice clothes and Rolex watches and acting more like a badass. He was the wrestler your girlfriend could love. Of late the Rock has not been wrestling much but its hard to find fault with that decision. You too would try to broaden your horizons if your signature tag line was ""Do you smell what the Rock is cooking?"" The first sign that the role the Rock plays in The Rundown will be a departure is his chest which is fully covered by a shirt. Hes Beck a bounty hunter who doesnt like to use guns for some unexplained reason. The head-knocking begins immediately in a nightclub and thats where the Austrian Oak himself Arnold Schwarzenegger walks by our hero in a dark corridor and tells him to ""Have fun"" This is a nice passing-of-the-torch moment but it also invites an unenviable comparison. The Rock doesnt have the articulated body that made Arnold for a brief muscular moment the Eighth Wonder of the World. In his prime Arnold also didnt require a puny thing like character development; he was impossible not to watch. And his Austrian accent provided built-in comic relief. Moments like the one in Conan the Barbarian (1982) when a Mongol general asks Arnold ""What is best in life?"" and he answers ""To crush your enemies see them driven before you and to hear the lamentation of the women"" were ineffably weird and unforgettable. A new schlock hero was born. The Rock however needs a character something with which to flex his acting muscles. In The Rundown his main identifiable trait is that hes a cool customer--unruffled committed to the task at hand--but he is perhaps too cool. When Beck gets angry the menacing line he delivers seems more suited to a PowerPoint presentation ""You can choose Option A or Option B."" This is not the stuff that camp action stars are made of. When the Rock does mix it up hes pretty good He has a convincing way of throwing around his body in a heedless manner and he pulls off an impressive move where he wraps his enemies in his legs and then flips them in a circle. Theres an excellent moment when he collapses a tower of bad guys by throwing himself through a support pillar. The big showdown has the Rock fighting an entire compound of enemies in the fine tradition of Kurosawas Yojimbo (1961) or perhaps more memorably Stallones Rambo First Blood Part II (1985). The Rocks acting is perhaps best described as facially located He does a lot of looking to the right and to the left and ""The Peoples Eyebrow"" as he once deemed it gets quite a workout. His comic foil is Seann William Scott who plays Travis a wisecracking graduate student (a rare breed) searching for a precious golden artifact. Standing in his way is Hatcher (Christopher Walken) an evil military-type presiding over a gold mine where Indians dig with their hands and are mercilessly exploited by his henchmen. Johnny Depp proved in this summers Pirates of the Caribbean that a commercial blockbuster can provide a little breathing room for an actor to deliver an inspired freewheeling performance. Walken does not follow suit; he overdelivers a lot of Col. Kurtz speeches and sometimes mid-tirade betrays an ""easy payday"" smirk. The token girl is the young Afro-Cuban-Indian-Irish-Puerto Rican actress Rosario Dawson--comely bartender by day respected rebel leader by night. She has the ability to toss off natural line readings while holding an M-16 which means shell never have to look hard for work in Hollywood. With the business about lost icons and copious bullwhips The Rundown is clearly aiming for some fragment of the magic of the Indiana Jones series. (Scott even bears a faint and presumably unintended resemblance to Harrison Ford.) Where the two movies depart is at their target audience. George Lucas wrote Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) as an homage to the adventure comics he read as a child; the whole movie is infused with an all-ages innocence. The Rundown like many recent action movies is aggressively adolescent. It hearkens back to the time in a young mans life when humping monkeys were funny when a promise didnt count if your fingers were crossed when debating pointless hypothetical questions (""Who would win a fight between Mike Tyson and Muhammad Ali?"") held a fascination and when professional wrestling offered endless senseless entertainment.

Actors The Rock left and Sean William Scott star in the action adventure The Rundown. This is even more true of the bounty hunter His Honor Mr. Rock plays in The Rundown. He body-slams baddies bodyguards and simple pests at will. The last movie to feature as many actors on their backs must have been something former porn star Marilyn Chambers filmed in her heyday. (Related item Watch the trailer for The Rundown) More about the movie The Rundown  (out of four) Stars The Rock Seann William Scott Rosario Dawson Christopher Walken Director Peter Berg Distributor Universal Rating PG-13 for adventure violence and some crude dialogue Yet by nature the character is as gentle and affable as this Amazonian adventure is -- a yarn complete with an oddball robber baron pro football linemen Type-A monkeys and hallucinogenic fruit. And affability explains why a movie this mediocre could end up being a hefty one-week performer -- at least -- at the box office. Even an unengaged viewer wont have to sweat much to get through this 104-minute movie. The Rock plays Beck who longs to open a restaurant with money awaiting him if hell just retrieve his boss runaway son (American Weddings prime cut-up Seann William Scott) from the jungle. Even though actor Scott again indulges his standard ""what me worry?"" screen persona the script informs us that the doofus he plays dropped out of Stanford. The fact that he could get into Stanford is the most unlikely screen revelation since Disney cast Goofy as a father in 1995s A Goofy Movie leading to the conclusion that Goofy had once had sex. Still Scotts character has enough archaeological prowess to be seeking a priceless jungle treasure also coveted by the villainous baron (Christopher Walken twitch intact) and his native wage-slaves making 65 cents an hour. In pursuit Scott The Rock and a local bartender (comely of course and played by Rosario Dawson) all end up in the wilds. This does not cramp The Rocks style because theres always someone to fight hand-to-hand no matter how limited the population. We get lots of quick cutting and occasional strobe effects in these brawls. Were Jackie Chan employing the same visual choreography in one of his films you might think it was an attempt to camouflage the old rockin-chairs-got-me syndrome. But in truth the action plays competently and amuses enough. And director Peter Berg rebounds some from 1998s Jon Favreau-Cameron Diaz comedy Very Bad Things which was one of the worst movies of the decade. This said dont expect too much -- especially if The Rundown ends up sustaining its takeoff with audiences as unthreatening Hollywood fare is wont to do in the fall. If Arnold Schwarzenegger had made a movie this tepid in his Commando/Terminator heyday burned fans would be suggesting that he pursue some tenure as a Fresno alderman.

Ah-nold it appears is passing the mantle of Beloved Yet Wooden Action Hero to a vast and amiable fellow known as The Rock who here plays Beck a ""retrieval expert"" sent on a mission to the Amazon jungle. It should be noted that the guy sending Beck on the mission operates a meat grinder throughout their conversation which is just about what you need to get the upper hand with this hulk -- Beck is capable were shown of beating up entire rooms full of people singlehandedly. But he meets his match in the Amazon squaring off against rogue adventurer Travis (Seann William Scott) enigmatic siren Mariana (Rosario Dawson) and crackpot despot Hatcher (Christopher Walken). While you wont exactly walk out humming the plot ""The Rundown"" should go down quite decently with popcorn; its got plenty of jungle action scenes reminiscent of ""Romancing the Stone"" or an Indiana Jones movie. Travis and Beck at one point have a nifty duel while dangling upside down from vines; and theres some downhill cliff-rolling that most definitely gathers moss (and spells doom for Becks natty khaki suit). Movie review 1/2 ""The Rundown"" with The Rock Seann William Scott Christopher Walken Rosario Dawson Ewen Bremner. Directed by Peter Berg from a screenplay by R.J. Stewart and James Vanderbilt. 98 minutes. Rated PG-13 for adventure violence and some crude dialogue. Several theaters. The Rock has a nicely relaxed presence onscreen; hes not actually projecting emotion or anything like that but none is needed. (And my hat is off to any performer who can deliver the line ""Youre threatening me with pee"" without giggling.) Dawson and her cleavage perform nicely (what you want substance here?); Scott grins diabolically in that Jim Carrey Jr. way of his. And Walken performs his usual larceny -- he not only steals the movie he practically takes it to the pawn shop. The wild-haired Hatcher is a gentlemanly lunatic speaking in seemingly an entirely different language from everyone else. After one setback he launches into a diatribe that begins ""I feel like a little boy who has lost his first tooth"" and ends with him barking ""Do you understand the CAAAAAncept of the tooth fairy?"" Its an inspired moment; entire movies can be built on less.

Starring the Rock Seann William Scott Christopher Walken and Rosario Dawson. Directed by Peter Berg. (PG-13 minutes. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The Rock looks like furniture -- like a walnut china closet to be specific -- but when he talks he sounds perfectly reasonable even diffident. In his first scene in ""The Rundown"" a witty fast-paced action film hes a strong- arm guy who has to shake down an athlete over a gambling debt. Flustered apologetic and achingly polite he approaches the athlete in a crowded nightclub and ends up with a drink in his face. This is an obvious mistake on the part of the athlete -- a 220-pound mistake -- but that such a mistake could be depicted and believed says something affirming about the Rocks prospects for long-term stardom. Would anybody throw a drink in Arnolds face? In Stallones face? In Steven Seagals face? No those guys played supermen. The Rock is something else. Hes Superman and Clark Kent rolled into one and that combination gives him lots of room for drama comedy and showing a human side. So this is a very good film for the Rock who proves hes just as much a star in street clothes as he was in a loincloth (""The Scorpion King""). And its a very good one for director Peter Berg who demonstrated with his debut film ""Very Bad Things"" a certain joyful twisted screen personality thats all over ""The Rundown."" The action sequences are novel the performances are slightly askew and the camera work is vigorous and mostly effective. Heres an example of something unexpected that Berg does with the camera that suggests the movies flavor He shows three people in a little boat in the Brazilian rain forest. Then he films them overhead and pulls back the camera. He keeps pulling back until theyre just a dot in the distance and then farther back until the boat cant be seen by the naked eye. Then still in the same shot he zooms in on a truck riding down a jungle road. Now Berg isnt a great director or else hed have had a reason for the shot. But hes not a lousy director either or he never would have thought of the shot. What he is is a director who knows how to keep it fun. One could say he has a talent for trash except that sounds condescending and nobody who makes a movie as entertaining as ""The Rundown"" deserves condescension. Berg establishes a tone thats arch without being self-mocking and stays a step ahead of his audience the whole way. The Rock plays Beck a nice muscular guy who is interested in cooking and dreams of opening a restaurant. He decides to take one last job from the old crook he works for -- he has to go to the rain forest in Brazil find the crooks son Travis (Seann William Scott) and bring him back to Los Angeles. When Beck gets there he finds a heart-of-darkness nightmare with natives living in hellish slavery working in gold mines owned by a man named Hatcher played by Christopher Walken at his most Walken-like. Walken has become such a national institution that the temptation to write specifically for his voice must be overwhelming. Theres a scene in which he has to explain to his henchmen why he resents Becks coming to town to retrieve Travis. ""Its like youre waiting for the tooth fairy . . ."" The script by R.J. Stewart and James Vanderbilt has him getting bogged down in an extended tooth fairy analogy made further complicated by its having to be translated into Portuguese for his workers. Its funny writing but what puts it over is Walkens reliably dead-eyed deadpan delivery. Beck intrudes into Travis life just as Travis -- played by Scott as a bug- eyed young wise guy -- is about to retrieve an ancient relic worth millions. Hatcher wants it and so does Mariana (Rosario Dawson) and so the film becomes a scramble for the treasure and a scramble for Beck and Travis to escape the jungle with Hatcher in pursuit. Sometimes Berg overdoes it. Theres a scene in a cave done almost entirely in quick close-ups that leaves the audience with no sense of place. But most of Bergs flourishes are amusing including his strategy of intercutting the climactic shootout with the nonsensical ravings of a Scottish madman (Ewen Bremner) who observes the action from a porch. Somebody has been stealing moves from Oliver Stone. - This movie contains violence and some crude dialogue.

He feels like the body double for some charismatic rogue who never showed up for work. Some claim his appeal lies in his very averageness his ability to evoke the high school jock and/or jerk we all knew and in some cases loved. Nah. Scotts shtick (which reached a peak of mediocrity in the last ""American Pie"" installment) is hard-won and desperate like a punch in the shoulder thats too hard to be friendly yet too feeble to impress. So Im surprised and delighted to report that The Rundown is actually a lot of fun mostly because The Rock simply by standing there and being The Rock cancels out Scott entirely. Propelled by the pro wrestlers refined bone-crusher theatrics and director Peter Bergs undiluted delirium (you can practically hear the ""Very Bad Things"" helmer cackling behind the camera) this action comedy is the wildly asinine crack-up derby that ""XXX"" should have been. And Scotts contribution however slight actually fits. As Travis hes the MacGuffin that ""retrieval specialist"" Beck (The Rock a.k.a. Dwayne Johnson) must recover from the Brazilian rain forest for the prodigals shady crime lord father (William Lucking). Whether you see Travis as a character or a plot device is determined entirely by your affection for Scott - Berg doesnt make you choose. No hes got bigger louder cheekier fish to fry bravura five-on-one fights to choreograph hilariously long falls to stage and one very crazy Christopher Walken to wrangle. The actor plays Hatcher a great white globalist whos enslaved the local ""Oompa- Loompas"" (and you havent lived until youve heard Walken say ""Oompa-Loompas"") to work in his gold mine - and naturally he has his own mysterious interest in Travis. Floating between Brandos Kurtz and Brandos Moreau he slings not only Wonka-derived slurs but also warped Conrad allusions (""I am the haht in the dahkness"") and a demented riff on the tooth fairy. Theres a girl too (Rosario Dawson) and an equally irrelevant ancient artifact but its all just an excuse for The Rock to dish out disciplined beat-downs looking ever-sleek but never preening. No Arnold throwback hes a new beast the action beefcake as metrosexual - and hes anything but average.
