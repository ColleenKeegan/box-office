Comments Stuart Little 2 The eponymous mouse of the E.B. White classic returns in this mildly amusing childrens film (2002) mixing live-action people with computer-animated creatures. Sheltered by the Little family--father Hugh Laurie mother Geena Davis and brother Jonathan Lipnicki--the blissfully normal Stuart (voice-over by Michael J. Fox) befriends a waiflike bird (Melanie Griffith) who turns out to be a jewel thief controlled by a big bad falcon (James Woods). Other than its quaint eccentricities--the Littles are an Ozzie and Harriet family oblivious to modern-day Manhattan--the film is fairly formulaic though some of its puns and wisecracks are hilarious especially those delivered by the Littles lazy and cynical Persian cat (Nathan Lane). Rob Minkoff directed a script by Bruce Joel Rubin (Ghost). PG 78 min.

(HANDOUT PHOTO) Photo Credit Sony Pictures Imageworks Stuart Little (voiced by Michael J. Fox) and Margalo (voiced by Melanie Griffith) become fast friends in Columbia Pictures family comedy Stuart Little 2. (HANDOUT PHOTO) Photo HANDOUT Little ties that bind / Lovable mouse can tug adults heartstrings too 1 / 1 Back to Gallery STUART LITTLE Childrens movie. Starring Geena Davis Hugh Laurie and the voices of Michael J. Fox Nathan Lane and Melanie Griffith. Directed by Rob Minkoff. (PG. 78 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Half the appeal of ""Stuart Little 2"" is in looking at the furry little fellows face. Stuart is a computer-generated character whos so meticulously crafted that he has facial expressions twitchy whiskers and glistening fur. He is seamlessly woven into the movies live action so that it hardly dawns on viewers that he is anything but a real person. Kids of course could be expected to react to Stuart as though he were real and become absorbed in his struggles and adventures but adults may be surprised by his emotional pull. Hes like every beloved pet we ever wished we could talk to. Here and there ""Stuart Little 2"" may hit a few wrong notes but it strikes an emotional chord. The picture takes place in a New York City of such unspeakable sweetness that it can either warm the heart or make a person sick. Mom and Dad (Geena Davis and Hugh Laurie) are the kindly parents of two human children and of Stuart their adopted mouse son. They live in harmony in a magnificent brownstone (Dad must be doing all right) and Stuart attends school driving there every day in a red toy convertible. Its a nice enough life for a mouse on the edge of puberty but hes having trouble fitting in. Its his size. He cant play soccer. No one asks him to play video games. He needs a friend whos about his height -- and then one day he meets one when a little bird trying to escape a falcon lands in the passenger seat of his convertible. ""Stuart Little 2"" benefits from expressive vocal performances for the animated characters. Michael J. Fox gives Stuart a quality of perpetual surprise. As Margalo the bird Melanie Griffith finds new and expressive ways to use her distinct voice getting past the baby-talk monotone that has been something of her trademark. In several scenes Griffith gets to play opposite her ""Another Day in Paradise"" co-star James Woods the voice of Falcon a criminal among birds. One does not get the sense of celebrity voices run amok but of actors tailoring their performances to the script which by kids-movie standards is clever and economical. (It was written by Bruce Joel Rubin who wrote ""Ghost."") Comic relief comes in the form of the fluffy indolent cat Snowbell -- a live-action character with animated facial expressions played by a wisecracking Nathan Lane. After about 35 minutes this short feature starts to drag as it sets up a story involving Stuarts striking out on his own but it picks up again 15 minutes before the finish. The movie is buoyed through some of its dull patches by special-effects sequences that are so nicely done that theres no thinking about them as effects. Its just Stuart flying a model airplane through New York. In fact the simulation of heights in ""Stuart Little 2"" is expert enough to provoke a weak-in-the-knees feeling. Yet technical smoothness is hardly the films main virtue. Instead its a sweetness that slips in under the radar. The following either constitutes a recommendation or evidence of an impending nervous breakdown but I found Stuart and Margalos relationship moving especially in the way they both grew from knowing each other. However that information is to go no farther than this room. . This film contains moments of mortal peril.

Fox Jonathan Lipnicki Brad Garrett Melanie Griffith Nathan Lane Hugh Laurie James Woods Steve Zahn; Director Rob Minkoff; Author Bruce Joel Rubin; Release Date Wide 07/19/2002; Runtime (in minutes) 72; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Columbia Pictures Posted July 26 2002 -- 1200 AM EDT Its a sign of the times that Stuart Little one of the rare sublime novels for children was turned into an air-popped digitally animated talking-critter jamboree that wiped away the books melancholy beauty. The surprise of Stuart Little 2 is that in its slapstick-lite way it comes closer than the first movie did to evoking the books wistful vision of loyalty and friendship. Stuart now comically well- integrated into the Little family (its a wry joke that Geena Davis and Hugh Laurie casually refer to him as their ""son"") finds a comrade in Margalo a troubled parakeet who drops out of the sky and into his miniature sedan. Michael J. Fox and Melanie Griffith voice these two with a vulnerable urgency and the animation is so vibrant that you can practically reach out and touch the fur and feathers. Very much a kiddie ride Stuart Little 2 is lively without being hyperactive - its a bouncy mouse caper with a wee bit of soul.

Aimed squarely at moppets with piddling attention spans second pic about the adorably cute mouse and his human adoptive parents should perform nicely as a midsummer B.O. magnet. At 78 minutes ""Stuart Little 2"" runs 14 minutes shorter than its kid-pleasing predecessor which should give some idea of the target aud for this slight but lively sequel. Aimed squarely at moppets with piddling attention spans second pic about the adorably cute mouse and his human adoptive parents should perform nicely as a midsummer B.O. magnet even without luring many teens or childless grown-ups. Original 1999 release sniffed out 300 million in global B.O. Michael J. Fox reprises his splendidly apt voiceover chores for Stuart the 3-inch-tall walking-and-talking rodent introduced in E. B. Whites classic childrens book. Better still Nathan Lane returns to speak for Snowball a white chinchilla Persian cat with the overcompensating hauteur of a snooty waiter in a second-rate restaurant. Also back in harness for human roles Hugh Laurie and Geena Davis as Mr. and Mrs. Little Stuarts proud and protective adoptive parents and Jonathan Lipnicki as George Little Stuarts older ""brother."" (Twins Anna and Ashley Hoelck take turns playing the newest member of the Stuart household baby Martha.) Sequel picks up several months after ""Stuart Little"" with Stuart happily attending school (in his very own miniature car) just like a regular kid George serving as a simpatico older sibling -- and Snowball reluctantly accepting the fact that hes sharing the Littles Manhattan brownstone with the equivalent of bite-size fast food. Pic quickly establishes that Stuart while mostly happy with the Little family yearns to have a friend of roughly his size. Which leads to the first of many life lessons offered in Bruce Joel Rubins streamlined script Be careful what you wish for. While Stuart is zipping home from school one day a seemingly injured bird named Margalo (Melanie Griffith) drops out of the sky and into Stuarts passenger seat. The frazzled fowl claims she has incurred the wrath of Falcon (James Woods) a malevolent bird of prey who forces smaller birds to hunt and steal (think Fagin with feathers). Stuart eagerly offers to take Margalo back to the Little residence where she can recover. Naturally a shy romance starts to blossom. But returning director Rob Minkoff slyly preps aud to expect the worst. A nice touch At one point Stuart and Margalo watch ""Vertigo"" the classic drama of a man whos duped by a woman who isnt all that she seems. Sure enough Margalo eventually vanishes with Mrs. Littles favorite ring. Stuart sets out to find her with a little help -- very little help actually -- from a skittish Snowball. Given the spectacular and sophisticated CGI work on view its tempting to wonder whether in terms of a budget-to-running time ratio ""Stuart Little 2"" may be one of the most expensive pics ever made. Stuart looks more impressive than ever with each hair on his face every crease in his pants vividly rendered. Margalo is animated with equal attention to detail and Falcon is so thoroughly persuasive in his steel-eyed menace that some tykes may be genuinely frightened by his icy ferocity. Interaction between digital figures and human beings is so remarkably seamless that after just a few minutes one stops marveling and simply accepts the miracles as a kind of matter-of-fact naturalism. Production designer Bill Brzeski does a fine job of grounding pic in something like reality by evoking a Manhattan that is at once romanticized and contemporary. Griffiths voicings charm the audience as well as Stuart while Woods is terrifically sinister and amusingly sardonic. Steve Zahn another vet of the original has a couple of funny moments as Monty a none-too-bright alley cat. And Lane once again steals every scene hes in with his purring petulance. Human players are game and somehow manage to keep from being completely upstaged by visuals.
