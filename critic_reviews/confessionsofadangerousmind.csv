"The Hit Man washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies The Hit Man Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday January 24 2003 In Baltimore there is a visionary cultural institution with a distinguished name; in the local parlance however it is known as the Museum of Art by Crazy People. That is exactly where the world premiere of ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" George Clooneys take on Chuck Barriss autobiography should have been held. How crazy? Real crazy. Crazy like a crazy fox. Crazier than a crazy fox. This crazy Chuck Barris invented ""The Gong Show"" but when the world ceased to pay attention to him he announced in an autobiography his delirious fantasy that he had been an assassin for the CIA. How do we know Barriss claim is screwball? Well in the first place I was an assassin for the CIA and I never saw him hanging out in the halls at Langley or at the Company picnics or bowling league. We assassins had a killer bowling team at the Herndon Readi-Strike We used to cream those wusses in Blackmail amp; Extortion In the second place . . . I mean really. A quiz-show producer without language skills local contacts cover stories meaningful clandestine training escape routes an emergency communications program fallback plans . . . wandering the Third World shooting people. What Barris seems not to understand is that the killing part is basically pretty easy; its the getting in and getting out that marks the professional. I mean really. But the trick of the movie is that it takes this claim straight -- no ice no chaser no winks or nods. Do the moviemakers believe Barris? Not for a second. But they play it as he wrote it the literal deadpan story of a man who invented vulgar quiz shows made millions had sex with a lot of women was widely castigated as a barbarian by the genteel elite -- and killed people for the CIA until a nervous breakdown caused him to confront and recount it all (helpfully providing the flashback structure for the film). Its so hard being Chuck Barris A character actor named Sam Rockwell -- you wont remember him but youll remember the characters he played such as the demented tag-along in ""Galaxy Quest"" -- is excellent and commanding in his promotion to main man. He has one of those memorably unmemorable faces so helpful to an actor so debilitating to a star. He gets Chucks desperate insecurity his bohemian rhapsodies his haunted nature his drive his strange capacity to take drivel dead seriously. But Rockwell though hes onscreen in every scene is possibly the least provocative of the four personalities that haunt the enterprise the other three being Barris himself director/co-star Clooney and oddly the co-producer Steven Soderbergh. You feel Barris everywhere in the film which is essentially a plunge into the strangeness of the mind he self-advertises as ""dangerous."" When people call themselves ""dangerous"" arent they really flattering themselves as well as marketing a product? Who would read a book or see a movie titled ""Confessions of an Essentially Harmless Schnook""? On the facts Chuck Barris had a cunning mind a clever mind a greedy mind an ambitious mind -- even you might say a natural television mind; but he was about as dangerous as Dick Clark though not as smart. His most salient charm was his utter lack of charm which made him seem almost like a naif -- when he was actually a ganef and the public was his mark. As the movie chronicles vividly enough he was an ambitious Philadelphia hustler who caught on in the early 60s at a network where he proved a quick study at cheapo production. But he kept losing jobs as policies and politics changed and he understood soon enough that working at the network wasnt the answer Selling to the network was the answer. He had energy he had deep conviction in the shallowness of his purpose and he had relentlessness. Heres what part of ""No"" he didnt understand All of it. Finally in 1966 he sold ""The Dating Game"" based on a shrewd principle Nothing sells like sexual yearning. If you can fake that you can make a fortune. The show trafficked in stupidity inanity smarmy double-entendre and the rest of course is hysteria. ""The Newlywed Game"" followed then his masterwork ""The Gong Show"" which he himself in a frenzy of narcissism hosted. Thats the Chuck Barris we know and love slightly cute slightly cuddly completely disengaged doing inappropriate stuff with his hands and his hair coming across as the worlds first game show anti-host in his way as pathetic as the contestants those pathetic samples of rejected tissue who showed up for the masochistic pleasure of being destroyed by such giants of entertainment as Jaye P. Morgan and Rex Reed. My favorite -- from a wasted young manhood spent watching too many ""Gong Shows"" -- was a pitiful guy who sang a song called ""Im Just an Old Weakie"" ""weakie"" being a synonym for ""weakling"" a word for which he couldnt find a rhyme. He lasted one refrain before being gonged back to richly deserved oblivion. During all this Chuck claims he was killing people overseas. Clooney to his credit doesnt blink at this absurd assertion. He seems to get a deeper truth which is that Barriss fantasies about himself are more revealing than the facts about him. One is left in some sort of pitiful awe at Barriss childish fantasy that expresses itself in godlike identification with the assassin. What secret rages what deep feelings of hostility inferiority exile and self-hatred he must feel to see the pinnacle of his existence that moment when he points the silenced Walther theres a pffft and one less American enemy breathes the free air of Earth. And how sad that a man who engineered the moment when Rex Reed gonged Mr. Weakie would stoop so low CONTINUED 1 <a href=""http//www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2003/01/24/AR2005033116253_2.html"">2</a> <a href=""http//www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2003/01/24/AR2005033116253_2.html"">Next</a> gt; (c) 2003 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2003/01/24/AR2005033116253.html,200,confessionsofadangerousmind2,confessionsofadangerousmind,washingtonpost

HANDOUT PHOTO/VERIFY RIGHTS AND USEAGE Photo HANDOUT Most dangerous game / Confessions captures the dark side of Gong Show host Chuck Barris 1 / 1 Back to Gallery CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND Drama. Starring Sam Rockwell Drew Barrymore and Julia Roberts. Directed by George Clooney. (R. 117 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Actors who become directors usually make movies that are strong on acting values and tame on visuals. But George Clooney in his directing debut breaks the mold with ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" a moody picture thats filled from start to finish with camera tricks unexpected angles and innovative flourishes. Actually its almost too much but then excess feels about right for the subject matter an adaptation of game-show mogul Chuck Barris autobiography. There may be more entertaining and less problematic movies but ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" has something about it that hangs in there working on the mind like a dog gnawing on a table leg. The movie makes a case for itself through sheer oddness and perversity. Heres the story of the man who created ""The Dating Game"" and ""The Newlywed Game"" and was both the creator and host of ""The Gong Show"" which was an absolute sensation in the late 1970s. Yet what does the movie focus on? Barris clandestine career as a CIA assassin. Thats right Barris claims that in the years he was running televisions most popular game shows he was sneaking off every so often to Eastern Europe or Latin America to kill communists and revolutionaries. Obviously Barris is either lying or telling the truth. But the fascinating thing -- and the key to enjoying the movie without getting bogged down in the question of fact or fiction -- is in realizing that Barris if hes lying is revealing an even greater truth. Barris who once wrote a commercially successful novel may think hes merely indulging his creative side with the assassin story -- or breaking the facade of idiot good nature that we associate with game-show hosts -- or revealing the hostility beneath that facade. But hes doing something much more illuminating Hes giving us a reason to loathe him. And hes providing a tangible excuse for his own self- loathing. That self-loathing is beautifully captured by Sam Rockwell and is the linchpin of his excellent performance. The surface stuff is impressive -- Rockwell has the walk the talk and the gestures down -- but the self-loathing informs them all providing the glint of doubt and anger behind the smile as well as the drive to succeed. Self-loathing is even an element in Barris humanity his sympathy toward the underdog. At least as portrayed here Barris is a success who never feels successful a reasonably likable guy who always feels like scum. Rarely if ever has the screen biography of a living person worked harder to portray its subject as a contemptible loser. We first meet Barris in 1981 when he has hit bottom. His reign at the top is over and now hes lumbering around a stinking apartment naked looking like Howard Hughes. Flashbacks tell the story of his youth and rise. As a teenager he could never get girls. He lies his way into his first job. He lies his way into his first relationship. Everything crumbles and then the CIA comes along -- in the form of a mysterious agent played by Clooney -- and teaches him how to be a killer. Along the way he finds a sweet hippie girlfriend he doesnt deserve (Drew Barrymore) and comes into contact with a Mata Hari-like spy played by Julia Roberts in what I would argue is her best performance. For once that unforgiving quality in her screen persona is an asset not something to be fobbed off as righteousness just toughness for its own sake. And she is tough. The game shows are dealt with almost incidentally and its the one great weakness of Charlie Kaufmans (""Adaptation"") screenplay. In its rush to present Barris life as one steaming pile of garbage lived under a film noir cloud the movie dismisses his game shows as a bright delusion as kitsch. In the process it denies the pop cultural significance that makes Barris life of interest in the first place. Heres the truth The difference between America in the 1950s and 1960s is not the difference between Elvis and the Beatles. Its the difference between ""Whats My Line?"" and ""The Dating Game."" Barris captured his moment. Most unforgivably the movie skirts over the phenomenon that was ""The Gong Show"" and ignores the fact that despite a few naysayers people adored Chuck Barris. He was irreverent and refreshing and it took the public several years to tire of him. What thats like -- to be loved on a mass scale and then dismissed -- is a pain the movie ought to have explored since its probably the main thing that sent Barris into that spiral in the early 80s. Instead we get the CIA -- the CIA as metaphor -- plus the spectacle of Barris flagellating himself so we wont do it first. Im not sure ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" is a good movie but I am sure I like it. This film contains sexual situations graphic violence and strong language.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind is a heady pop trip. Slate Sign In Sign Up Confessions of a Dangerous Mind is a heady pop trip. Confessions of a Dangerous Mind is a heady pop trip. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Jan. 10 2003 1228 PM King Gong Confessions of a Dangerous Mind is a heady pop trip. By David Edelstein Barrymore and her ""Ash-ken-atzy"" Jew Those of us just beginning to use drugs when we first saw The Gong Show in the 1970s had no problem getting a bead on its host Chuck Barris A bopping little man who never made eye contact and spasmodically pointed and scooped the air he looked like daytime TVs first bong-head. But another explanation for that affect turns out to be shame. Unlike the blandly sniggering hosts of the other hit shows he created The Dating Game and The Newlywed Game Barris was manifestly uncomfortable as the front man for a program that exploited contestants exhibitionism for fun and profit. He hadnt reckoned on becoming a part of his own freak show and that air of druggy dissociation was the best way he could figure out to preserve his personal integrity. Advertisement Barris autobiography the basis for the new movie Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (Miramax) takes that druggy dissociation to hallucinatory levels. Half of it is a breezy funny often self-deprecating account of his career in television which he entered in large part to get laid. The other half charts his shadow life as a CIA assassin. I dont know whether the CIA part is true or not (it seems about as likely as John Edwards ability to talk to those whove ""crossed over"") but its inclusion in the book can be interpreted in several ways. The first is that Barris wants to be known for doing something more useful than creating humiliating game shows killing people. The second is the inverse He wants us to know that he could have done worse things than create humiliating game shows--he could have killed people. The third and most likely is that he couldnt get a handle on being forever known as the creator of The Gong Show and willed into life a much cooler alter ego. The lively likable not-quite-satisfying new movie directed by George Clooney from a script by Charlie Kaufman seems to go with the last option that Barris wasnt entirely at home with the life that made him rich and famous that he wanted to believe he was capable of something more. The film begins with a bearded long-haired Barris (Sam Rockwell) in the throes of an existential break Having fled to a New York hotel room he stares into the mirror and ruminates (in voice-over narration) on the issue of aspiration versus accomplishment. The movie that follows begins with a sober crawl to the effect that it has been compiled from official documents and eyewitness accounts of Barris life--and there are interviews with Dick Clark Jaye P. Morgan and others to lend a faux verisimilitude. But no ones kidding anyone. Half of Confessions of a Dangerous Mind has a breezy biopic tone (with flashes of Annie Hall [1977]) in which Barris rises in television and meets and takes up with Penny Pacino (Drew Barrymore) a flaky and uninhibited artist. The second half is a Cold War noir involving Barris his CIA handler (George Clooney) and a Mata Hari beauty played by a darkly ravishing Julia Roberts. That second thread isnt played for camp exactly but the lighting and palette are stylized in ways that let you know that Clooney and Kaufman are putting you on and it feels irrelevant somehow. (It did in the book too.) It doesnt have a Walter Mittyish connection to whats going on in Barris life and it doesnt have enough logic or momentum on its own to generate suspense. Confessions of a Dangerous Mind works best as a rollicking trip through the pop culture of the 60s and 70s. Rockwell has the perfect featherweight aplomb and Barrymore is endlessly adorable with a natural screwball presence. Kaufman devises countless funny and original ways to chart Barris rise. (See he can too adapt) The scene in which the young producer (naked peering into the refrigerator of a network gofer--Maggie Gyllenhaal--with whom he has just slept) meets Barrymores Penny is an exquisite counterculture screwball duet. (Penny wants to make it with guys from all different ethnic backgrounds and hasnt yet had an ""Ash-ken-atzy"" Jew.) As a director Clooney has a marvelously theatrical eye He loves to track the actors back and forth in long exuberant takes and to layer the screen with multiple realities--life noir TV game show. The recreations of TheDating Game The Newlywed Game (""proof"" says Barris ""that any American would sell out their spouse for a washer-dryer or a lawnmower you can ride on"") and The Gong Show feel skin-crawlingly authentic. (Some of the footage is archival with Rockwell seamlessly intercut.) The movie doesnt jell though. It builds to Barris existential crisis; and if its a hoot to see him throw a paranoid fit over the identity of the Unknown Comic (the guy who tells smutty jokes with a paper bag over his head) his mania doesnt seem rich or resonant enough. I suppose its too much to expect Pirandellian stature from the madness of Chuck Barris--but thats about the only thing that would have made this mixed-up ego trip work. Confessions of a Dangerous Mind could have been the hipsters answer to A BeautifulMind (2001) mental illness as a game show where the winners get to find out who they really are. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Much time is spent on Barris purported assignments as a CIA assassin which he maintains was his real game during the time he was creating such seminal TV drivel as The Dating Game The Newlywed Game and The Gong Show. This is no biopic in the usual Hollywood sense. Barris autobiography is reinterpreted by brilliantly quirky screenwriter Charlie Kaufman who also wrote Being John Malkovich and the highly original Adaptation now in theaters. Review of the movie Confessions of a Dangerous Mind ( out of four) It is a mesmerizing movie that is cleverly -- if sometimes a bit too self-consciously -- directed by George Clooney in his first assignment behind the camera. The influence of Steven Soderbergh and Joel and Ethan Coen who have directed Clooney in recent films can be seen. There is some inspired and innovative camerawork and nimble editing in Confessions that enhances the loopy tale. Sam Rockwell gives a superior performance as Barris. Without employing caricature or impersonation Rockwell plays the complex latter-day carnival barker as a savvy promoter alternately narcissistic and self-loathing. Barris comes to despise his shows fans and the eccentrics who make up the changing cast on The Gong Show. In one particularly powerful scene Barris becomes unhinged on camera visualizing the slaughter of the studio audience to the accompaniment of Peter Paul and Marys If I Had a Hammer. Is he hallucinating or just wishing? Barris rise and fall are interspersed with bizarre flashbacks from his youth. In one his mother who wanted a daughter dressed him like a girl in his early years. Perhaps this was simply more of the con mans mass conning but it doesnt really matter whether the stories are even remotely true because Confessions is such a riveting account. Drew Barrymore plays Barris long-suffering girlfriend and Julia Roberts has an extended cameo a funny turn as a fellow spy. The narrative is interspersed with documentary-style footage of those who knew Barris -- such as Dick Clark Bob Eubanks and Jaye P. Morgan -- contributing their two cents worth about a man whose mind seemed dangerously prescient. Where would American Idol be if not for The Gong Show? Confessions may not be a straightforward bio nor does it offer much in the way of Barris motivations but the film is an oddly fascinating depiction of an architect of pop culture.

Did you know that Chuck Barris the rabbit-toothed mogul who created The Dating Game The Newlywed Game and The Gong Show was also a hitman for the CIA? The oddball fascination of this adaptation of Barris autobiography is that it treats his absurd claim of a double life in trash TV and espionage as a story so strange so beyond the pale of what even a huckster like Barris would dare to make up that it could maybe just possibly be true. The young actor Sam Rockwell works up a disarming sympathy for this frantic hustler and the movie nimbly directed by George Clooney plays as an ironic pop biopic whose subject is trivially off-center enough to make Ed Wood or Bob Crane look like Gandhi.

(Actually Mr. Kaufmans Adaptation has been out all of three weeks.) The whole is less than the sum of its parts the dueling Kaufman and Barris takes on self-flagellation dont exactly mesh. This film a shape-shifting apologia-biopic as weird as Adaptation is too cold for is own good. George Clooney though in his directorial debut does show an eye and a head for filmmaking. Theres a casual irony in the details with Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (based on Mr. Barriss unreliable unauthorized autobiography of the same name) making jokes of the lurid minutiae of the life of Mr. Barris who in his day was accused of the destruction of television Western civilization and the World as We Know It. Mr. Barriss ambition led him to create The Dating Game and The Newlywed Game shows that during the 1960s were considered the same ungodly manifestations of a sick mind that Survivor The Bachelor and Good Morning Miami are thought to be today. The films Barris (Sam Rockwell) does a mambo in his head between geekdom and desperation and Mr. Rockwell does a dazzling job of conveying the seething confusion beneath his characters dazed amiability. Mr. Rockwell gets this across partly by slightly parting his lips for much of the performance a gesture that catches Barris in transition; it is the nexus between the state of shock at whats going on around him and the moment when his talent for saying the wrong thing gets him into trouble. Barris finds himself attracted to Penny a proto-hippie played by Drew Barrymore who uses her cherubic flower-child eagerness well. Ms. Barrymore is more believable here than she has been in a movie for some time. She seems to have suddenly remembered that she could act instead of simply making herself adorable. The movie focuses on how Barriss low-key scramble for greatness -- Confessions of a Dangerous Mind even slips in the heros motivation for creating the forgettable pop hit Palisades Park -- supposedly gets him recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency and one of its agents Jim Byrd (Mr. Clooney in a know-it-all deadpan that borders on cadaverous). In one of the funniest marriages of cynicism and need since Otter used the obituaries to find dates in Animal House the film presses Mr. Barriss claim that The Dating Game lent itself to his globe-trotting adventures as a C.I.A. assassin. He could both chaperone the winning couple to whatever second-rate location they won -- here its cold war wastelands instead of Puerto Vallarta daydreamland -- and cram in some wetwork for the C.I.A. Though the prologue and epilogue -- with a bearded gone-to-seed Barris holed up in a hotel room of mountainous disarray -- are out of Apocalypse Now to tell this story of the 1960s gone wrong Mr. Clooney uses as a partial model The Parallax View a minor 70s classic about America turning sour. He has put together an impressive team including the production designer James D. Bissel and the cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel. Mr. Sigel filmed Mr. Clooney in one of the best pictures of the last decade Three Kings. Mr. Clooney is out to fashion a story blending politics comedy and anger in the way Three Kings did so seamlessly. The anger and comedy surface here. As Barriss successes bubble up and he finds himself in the midst of a C.I.A. mission and succeeding as host of The Gong Show (imagine American Idol featuring contestants of no talent instead of well not much talent) these peaks rise into a moment of horror. Mr. Rockwell peaks here too; watching the line between exploiter and exploited disappear makes him vertiginous. Its the through line that the movie carries over from the book and it makes the movie less about spritzing and more about suffering. The politics unfortunately get blurred too. The slapsticky assassination adventures seem like something out of another film about politics and pratfalls The Presidents Analyst. And when Julia Roberts shows up as a slinky double agent in hats that Diana Vreeland might have chosen Confessions slides dangerously close to Rocky and Bullwinkle. The picture misses the opportunity to make sound points like that the makin-whoopee honesty of Newlywed Game contestants is preferable to the fake-ideal nuclear-family sitcoms the networks force fed the country. At least The Newlywed Game couples admitted to having only one bed instead of the chaste twin-bed absurdity sold elsewhere. Mr. Rockwells fusion of flaky and direct is dead-solid perfect when his Barris is host of The Gong Show and slides around the stage as if he were about to break into some doo-wop soft-shoe clapping his hands to punctuate the silliness. Mr. Rockwell is able to give the film weight though it lacks shape. It suffers as much from ambition as the real-life Mr. Barris did; reading the book with Mr. Barris shuffling off from C.I.A. hit to television hit you wonder how he was able to squeeze in The Gong Show Movie and why the C.I.A. itself didnt put out a contract on his life for that one. Its evident that Mr. Kaufmans scripts work better when directed simply; Spike Jonze leaves his overflowing magic bag behind when he films one of them. Mr. Clooney pops off ideas the way Mr. Barris bopped on the Gong Show stage and seems determined to find metaphors for Mr. Barriss trajectory of worm-ridden victory and emptiness. Still Confessions of a Dangerous Mind is a good piece of work more often than not and this is one of the few times an actor turned director has chosen to subvert the feel-good genre for his maiden voyage. Confessions of a Dangerous Mind is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for murders strong language and behind-the-scenes ugliness at a major television network.

Bissell; produced by Andrew Lazar; released by Miramax Films. At the U.A. Union Square 14 13th Street at Broadway. Running time 115 minutes. This film is rated R.

Doing the gameshow impresario and ""unauthorized autobiographer"" one better ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" advances Chuck Barris tall tale of his double life as a TV producer and CIA assassin several degrees further and deeper resulting in a powerful and creative film. In much the same way thesp-turned-helmer John Malkovich applied his experience with strong directors to make his fine debut film ""The Dancer Upstairs"" first-timer George Clooney has absorbed his time with the Coen brothers David O. Russell and partner Steven Soderbergh to create an enveloping cinematic world that only rarely teeters into excess or self-seriousness. Repping a genuine breakthrough perf by a galvanizing Sam Rockwell as Barris pic will play best as a well-supported cult film with limited mass appeal pointing to a longer ancillary than theatrical run. Since the books 1984 publication literalists who have swallowed whole Barris wildest claims -- not only his exploits as a killer for the Company but his harrowing time trying to avoid being killed by a concerted KGB plot -- seem to have missed that the book is marbled with self-fictionalizing. Whats immediately clear in the first moments of the film is how Clooney and screenwriter Charlie Kaufman have wisely read Barris account as a man taking liberties with his own life and thus they feel free to take even further liberties. Now the movies Chuck is naked alone and sickly in a 1981 New York hotel room staring at the boob tube ignoring the entreaties of longtime love Penny (Drew Barrymore) on the other side of the locked door to take him home to L.A. With brief snippets of v.o. narration delivered by Rockwell in a groggy semi-whisper as a kind of narrative underscore pic cleanly and amusingly covers previous decades including Chucks nasty formative sexual experience as a boy with his sisters friend; his failing to make out with dates as a teen; his up-and-down first stab at a TV career at NBC in the mid-50s; his experience with Dick Clarks ""American Bandstand"" including penning hit tune ""Palisades Park"" for the show and his quietly comic first encounter with Penny. When Chuck seems to succeed in pitching ABC on ""The Dating Game"" ""Confessions"" reaches the end of its innocence and suddenly and unexpectedly turns left down shadowy alleys. The guide for this journey is CIA spook and handler Jim Byrd (Clooney) who appeals to Chucks taste for danger and recruits him into the ranks of spies. ""Confessions"" shows an astonishing range of photographic and editing effects that surpass any of Soderberghs past work and lenser Newton Thomas Sigels particular contribution to the movies seductive powers cant be overestimated. One of the cleverest and subtlest gambits is to depict Chucks secret life as mostly a series of adventures in chilly snowy conditions -- a literal Cold War -- that greatly helps contrast with the warm aqua look of 60s SoCal where the explosive success of ""Dating Game"" ""The Newlywed Game"" and other relationship gameshows turns Chuck into a producing powerhouse. If the film never quite succeeds in conveying the full impact of Barris Hollywood heyday and if Pennys wedlock entreaties grow wearisome theres compensation with the deepening complexities of the spy games which come to be dominated as much by sultry dangerous-looking CIA gal Patricia (Julia Roberts) as by the no-nonsense Byrd. The superb soundtrack and inspired song selections (augmented by Alex Wurmans grim basso piano scoring) identify each spook by music -- Beethovens ""Moonlight Sonata"" for Patricia the Whos ""Wont Be Fooled Again"" for Byrd -adding texture. After what seems in retrospect a miscalculation to film Chucks first hit in Mexico in the same urine-toned imagery as Soderberghs Mexican sequences in ""Traffic"" the rest of Chucks secret life plays notes of both the absurd and melancholic sustaining a funny unsettling paranoid style a la Richard Condon. Still ""Confessions"" carries the strong stamp of Kaufman (""Being John Malkovich"" ""Adaptation."") with the structure imposed by a primary source bringing out his best artistic judgment. Kaufman continues his fascination with characters on the verge of total collapse but this time benefits from material that eliminates the sort of solipsistic temptations that have seem to rep this writers Achilles Heel. Fans of the book will eventually be as surprised and startled as nonreaders not only by plot twists but an autumnal seriousness that concludes on the real Barris wizened face offering the project a tacit nonverbal authorization. A triumph of casting in all but one role Clooneys work with his actors has a strong theatrical tone. In his first major starring role Rockwell displays a virtuosos range of emotions and states of mind with a keen instinct for going against expectation. In the role of an international woman of mystery reconceived for the movie from the ground up Roberts has never looked so noirish and commandingly adult suggesting a capacity for anything. Clooneys Byrd is the actors ultimate less-is-more perf with a delivery as flat and scary as the Soviet steppes at night. Once again unable to age (as in ""Riding in Cars With Boys"") Barrymore feels out of sorts here playing one charming but unending note as the storys innocent. As Chucks fellow spy in decline Rutger Hauer makes a brief but strong impression. Casting of gameshow contestants including the wild and crazy ""Gong Show"" amateurs is aces (including Brad Pitts and Matt Damons ""Dating Game"" cameos). Adding to the layers here longtime Barris pals including Jaye P. Morgan Jim Lange and Clark appear in frank talking-head cutaways. So extensive and expressive is the combined work of Sigel production designer James A. Bissell and costumer Renee April that ""Confessions"" evolves into a full-fledged cinematic parable on American innocence lost. Soderberghs vet editor Stephen Mirrione is an invaluable contributor to pics graceful yet adventurous shifts and rhythms and the sound package (with aid of vet Kubrick sound man Edward Tise) has its own resonance.
