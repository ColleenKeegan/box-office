"Movie review Doubt -- 4 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Doubt -- 4 out of 5 stars Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman in Doubt Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman in Doubt Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman in Doubt Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic The thunderclap moments are a tad muffled in John Patrick Shanleys film adaptation of his play Doubt. But thanks to a nearly perfect cast this provocative glimpse into the Catholic priest child-molestation scandal manages to be deeply disturbing on several levels. Philip Seymour Hoffman is Father Flynn the ""modern"" priest at St. Nicholas Church and School in the Bronx which in 1964 has just admitted its first black student. Father Flynn gives entertaining and thoughtful sermons on ""isolation"" and ""doubt."" ""Doubt can be a bond as powerful and sustaining as certainty"" he preaches. That earns a raised eyebrow and raised suspicions from Sister Aloysius the hard case who rules over the school. Sister Aloysius doesnt have room for doubt. Her whole worldview is certitude. Meryl Streep plays this martinet as if shes Sister Zero Tolerance. Misbehaving kids earn a head slap; fellow nuns a withering look should they dare speak before she does at their austere and silent evening meal; and a too-friendly priest? Insinuations.Sister James ( Amy Adams) is an impressionable young teacher frightened by Sister Aloysius a little out of her depth in the classroom. But under the older nuns tutelage she can learn to be hard. And under Aloysius influence Sister James begins to have suspicions about Father Flynns interest in that new black student in school. What follows is a cat-and-mouse game between cunning old nun and free-spirit priest a war for the mortal soul of the younger nun and the future of this church and school. To Sister Aloysius its about standards morality and tradition. ""Every easy choice today will have its consequences tomorrow mark my words"" she fumes and she sets about bringing down the priest for something that has in more recent years become the shame of the Catholic Church. But did anything happen?The plays title was Doubt A Parable and thats where the film steps onto shaky ground. Unlike the play built on offstage events and hearsay the films literalism removes some of that ""doubt"" about guilt or innocence.The cast is splendid. Streep her eyes red-rimmed with anger at the world she is forced to watch go to heck in a handbasket plays the school principal as world-wise cagey but occasionally overmatched. The early confrontation-accusation scene with Father Flynn shows just how right the casting of Hoffman was. The Oscar-winner holds his own opposite the great Streep tipping from easy charm to fury in a flash.Adams suffers from being a bit on-the-nose playing Sister James naive side. Her moments of steely resolve and anger dont seem to rise organically from the script. Theyre just abrupt plot contrivances. But Doubt gives us plenty to chew on as it seeks to touch on the many possible explanations for priest-altar boy scandals painting in gray tones an issue weve been willing to see as simple black and white finding ""doubt"" in something the world has been certain it understands and condemns.

Doubt 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Doubt is not a usual sort of film. It wasnt a usual sort of play either when John Patrick Stanley first wrote it at the height of the clerical sex-abuse scandal in the Catholic Church a few years back. Originally subtitled ""a parable"" it asked monumental questions about guilt and gossip mongers without seeming especially pressed to answer them. Neither does Shanleys own film adaptation which finds its drama in the shrouded gloom of conscience. Did the Rev. Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) have inappropriate relations with the first black student at his parish school? In mounting her whispered campaign against him does Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) defend the boy or besmirch the name of an innocent man? The truth emerges. Or does it? The scandal concludes. Or can it? Doubt is precisely the point. Shanley who wrote Moonstruck and also directed Joe Versus the Volcano back in the day has recast the play with more characters and a wider setting taking this tough-minded morality tale into the streets of his own Bronx childhood. The effect is less than its parts a bit too talky and a touch too stagy hemmed in by an over-theatrical bent for confrontation. Yet its still a substantial hunk of drama literate and acted with heft. The student at the center of the brouhaha never appeared in the stage version but here hes portrayed with shambling innocence by the young actor Joseph Foster II. Amy Adams sparks with distressed compassion as Sister James the young nun who catches whiffs of the priests close bond with the boy and Viola Davis emits tangled maternal worry as his mother. But the stars of the show are Hoffman and Streep two sharp actors who know how to sink their fangs into a good character part. I would love to see them go head-to-head in a live production and I imagine Shanley would too; he indulges them slightly allowing them to pitch their monologues for the balcony in scenes that might have gone more hushed and cinematic. There is no need for the broader gestures either vocal or physical in a movie already flush with big ideas. In other ways Doubt is remarkably nuanced. Set in 1964 it captures that elongated transformative moment in Catholic history when the church was in the midst of Vatican II reforms -- and not everyone was pleased about it. Sister Aloysius the traditionalist observes the invisible line dividing priests and nuns on one side laity on the other. Father Flynn believes they should warm up relations with parishioners and students get to know them become like family. She shuns sweets ball-point pens and Frosty the Snowman. In his rectory drinking and yukking it up with fellow priests hes a red-meat hedonist in a Roman collar. His nails are too long; her views are too narrow. Doubt shows mercy for both characters asking us to appreciate Sisters frustration (""Men run everything"") and Fathers admonitions against snap moral judgments. In whats sometimes called ""the pillow sermon"" Flynn compares rumors to the release of feathers into the wind Once scattered they can never be retrieved. ""I dont know that anything is wrong"" says Sister James having just let loose one of her own. In Shanleys view of the universe not knowing is a natural state. ""Doubt can be a bond as powerful and sustaining as certainty"" Father Flynn says. ""When you are lost you are not alone."" Its just one disconcerting notion in a film chock full of them. Doubt asks hard questions and we dutifully squirm in reply. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Tactical Cree XML 4000-Lumen LED Flashlight for 8 + free...

Philip Seymour Hoffman portrays Father Flynn right and Meryl Streep portrays Sister Aloysius in a scene from ""Doubt."". Photo AP/Miramax Film Corp Andrew Schwartz. Share Print Save to your profile Connie Ogle miami Herald Doubt may have won the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for drama but the best reason to adapt the play for the screen isnt its considerable literary merit but its meaty roles and compelling subject matter -- the confusion of troubled faith the nature of moral obligation the power of the Catholic Church. Its a perfect vehicle for the Oscar-minded. Adapted and directed by playwright John Patrick Shanley Doubt is not exactly a tour de force but the film succeeds on the wattage of its stars Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman as a nun and priest at odds over an unspeakable suspicion. Shanley has effectively expanded his four-character drama to include parishioners other nuns and the student body at a Catholic school in 1964 an era when women still wore hats to Mass the Holy Ghost had not yet been replaced by the Holy Spirit and kind enthusiastic young nuns such as Sister James (Amy Adams) invoked the high-minded lessons of FDR to her class of eighth graders. Unfortunately the kids of St. Nicholas clearly have something to fear besides fear itself Sister Aloysius (Streep) the sort of terrifying authority figure that if you believe every lapsed Catholic who wrote a book about his childhood sent a generation racing into therapy. Sister Aloysius is a keen disciplinarian and fierce preserver of the status quo. She despises ball point pens -- which make students write like monkeys she growls -- and shudders to imagine the inclusion of the heretical song Frosty the Snowman in the schools Christmas play. She doesnt quite approve of the more modern Father Flynn (Hoffman) who preaches sermons on shockingly secular topics (example ``What do you do when youre not sure?). So when Sister James witnesses a strange incident involving the good father and the schools first black student and reports it to her superior Sister Aloysius grabs the whisper of possibility with feverish intensity. The crux of the film boils down to this Has Father Flynn taken liberties with young Ronald Miller? Or is Sister Aloysius viciously acting on her disapproval by using the most convenient means? Doubt which deftly reveals the ugly side of a patriarchy that allows men a freedom its female servants can never achieve boils down to this mystery. But on a deeper level its concerned with the nature of faith. Streep as pale and severe as she was golden and glowing in the summers buoyant if goofy Mamma Mia carries herself like an avenging angel and as Hoffmans eyes slide away from her accusations you wonder . . . did he? But the screenplay and these fine actors keep the audience guessing as uncertain about the outcome as these flawed people are of their committed course.

It tends to be confusing and have no clear conclusion."" So says Father Flynn from the pulpit of St. Nicholas the Bronx church where this young and popular priest has set up shop in the fall of 1964. In Doubt John Patrick Shanleys crisp cogent adaptation of his own Pulitzer- and Tony-winning play (tellingly called Doubt a Parable when it debuted in New York in 2004) the truth is left for the audience to decide. And while the conclusion isnt necessarily clear it is unsettling. Doubt is shot on the same streets where Shanley here making his second stab as a director grew up. (His first the failed Tom Hanks rom-com Joe Versus the Volcano.) It is the year following John Kennedys assassination and the midst of the Second Vatican Council a time of enormous change and upheaval in New York and the nation. But while Father Flynn is looking to loosen things up in his parish Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) principal of St. Nicholas parochial school stands firm in her embrace of the strict traditions of a Catholic education. Draped in a black habit with an almost comic black bonnet strapped tightly to her bespectacled head she patrols the halls and classrooms with a watchful eye dispensing a tap here a whack there to keep her mostly Irish and Italian American boys and girls in line. It is a different boy - Donald Miller (Joseph Foster) the schools first black student - who becomes the focus of the conflict between Father Flynn and Sister Aloysius. The priest has befriended the isolated unsure Donald. But an impressionable young nun (Amy Adams) has seen things between Flynn and the student that have troubled her and has reported her concerns to Sister Aloysius. That seed of suspicion is all Streeps character needs There will be no molestation of children by priests on her watch even though she has no evidence that such a thing occurred. Still she is sure ""A dog that bites is a dog that bites"" she tells Flynn in Shanleys big confrontation scene - a scene in Aloysius office shot at absurdly dramatic angles with the fierce ring of an unanswered phone going off at a nerve-racking clip. Theres more than a little humor at play in Shanleys dark tale - even in the aforementioned meeting - and the writer-director gets Streep Hoffman and Adams working at the top of their games. Viola Davis playing Donalds hard-pressed mother is also riveting in her few scenes - one of which a walk-and-talk with Streep speaks volumes about race and class institutional power abusive marriages and even homophobia all in a few deftly delivered minutes. But for all its high-caliber performances its cutting dissection of the roles of men and women within the Catholic hierarchy and its timely resonance in the wake of the churchs sexual abuse scandals theres something pat and tidy about Doubt. Instead of presenting a mystery about human nature and the intangibles of truth the film becomes on some level a kind of whodunit or a did-he-do-it? - a mere mystery in other words about a crime that may or may not ever have happened.

Disappointing film misses the chance to raise ""Doubt"" By John Moore Denver Post Theater Critic Twelve years of schooling by nuns left me with my share of bruised knuckles but my respect (and fear) intact. But ""Doubt"" makes you wonder what the sisters must have done to John Patrick Shanley as a boy because by the end of his new film I felt the overwhelming desire to be mean to nuns. Or maybe just to Meryl Streep. Those who have seen Shanleys unsettling Pulitzer-winning play will be more unsettled watching his story play out on-screen. Because theres disappointingly little doubt in ""Doubt."" And that makes a troubling play a disappointingly certain film. ""Doubt"" is a gender-based power play between chummy priest Father Flynn and Sister Aloysius the widow-turned-nun who runs the parish grade school in the Bronx circa 1964. She decides hes had inappropriate contact with the schools only black boy and becomes single-mindedly driven to exorcise him from the parish. Whereas the play was clearly a symbolic tug of war between pre-Vatican II absolute order (Sister Aloysius) and the more progressive and human approach that followed (Father Flynn) this film plays out as a witch hunt as outrageous as ""The Crucible."" And more than 300 years later fearmongers are still leading the charge. Ive read the script seen the play several times and now have seen the film. Doubt exists in the script. Is it possible Father Flynn did it? If so Sister Aloysius is a hero. If not shes Mary Warren in a habit. That doubt is necessary to the work because effective storytelling depends on a certain measure of ambiguity. But as we learned when the Denver Center Theatre Company staged ""Doubt"" last year its nearly impossible to convey even the slightest possibility that Father Flynn might be guilty on the stage. Its even harder on film Hes a good guy being railroaded by an old-guard biddy steeped in resentment about the second-class standing of women in the church. Thus the film becomes a treatise not on doubt versus certainty but on the nature of evil. And from a Catholic perspective her actions are insulting. When Shanley embarked on adapting and directing his tale for the screen the last thing I expected was a more absolute intractable and repugnant Sister Aloysius. I expected him to go the other way. Youve got Streep Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams (as the doe-eyed innocent who hands her superior the match with which to burn Father Flynn at the stake). Why not give us more of a psychological thriller one where our own certainty and allegiances shift as the tale progresses? That kind of nuance and complexity is missing from the film. Shanley told me in a 2007 interview that he wasnt interested in diving into the actual Catholic sex scandal. Well he should have been because at least that was based in truth. Instead Streeps Sister Aloysius comes off as Cruella de Vil. The Wicked Witch of the West. And to her I say Who cares? ""Doubt"" is a missed opportunity all the way through to its final scene which isnt nearly the statement it might have been. ""Doubt"" (the play) will be presented by OpenStage in Fort Collins opening Jan. 4 (970-221-6730).

The bearer of the jarring news is Sister Aloysius Beauvier. The principal of St. Nicholas School is played with stiff resolve by Streep. Hoffman is Father Brendan Flynn a genial priest who embodies the changes taking place in the church after Vatican II. Streep plays the widow-turned-nun with unfortunate rigidity. Her costume enforces that choice of tough old bird. Spectacles accentuate her beak. Her bonnet seems to hide her face even as it makes it unavoidable. The headdress hints too at a kinship between Catholicism and Puritanism. In the pulpit Hoffman captures his characters charisma best. An early homily on the lonesomeness of uncertainty is resonant with the social upheavals of the 1960s. A later sermon on innuendo is even richer. Though by the time the camera delivers its vivid expression of the sermons simile Flynns craft invites skepticism. Is his parable about gossip authentic -- or just rhetorically ingenious? Amy Adams plays Sister James. The hopeful novice teacher doesnt want to believe her superiors fears regarding Father Flynn. Yet she is the catalyst of the moral duel when she tells Aloysius she may (or may not) have seen something untoward in the priests interaction with Donald Miller. In a film meant to keep us guessing evidence is circumstantial. Contrasts are the opposite of clues. In near-silence the nuns consume supper with Sister Aloysius setting the glum tone. In a din of convivial even off-color chatter the priests drink scotch smoke cigars and consume a bloody roast. Where Sister Aloysius seeks to maintain a divide between clergy and congregants Flynn wants to forge the bonds of family. Scenes act as Rorschach blots. They tease our biases about gender politics in the Catholic Church. Why doesnt Father Flynns respect extend to Sister Aloysius? They gnaw at our anxieties about intimacy between adults and children. Is that a hug or a come-on? One of the things that changes the stakes dramatically is the presence of children. In the four-character play they are alluded to. Here they are fresh-faced or bullying or in the case of Donald Miller (Joseph Foster II) gentle and adrift. It would require tremendous denial on the part of moviegoers to ignore the past decade of lawsuits the Catholic Church has been beset by because of pedophile priests. Perhaps this is why ""Doubt"" seems to come down hardest on Sister Aloysius. After the medias spotlight on so much darkness the film must knock our own certainty about those narratives of abuse on its heels. In anticipation of the movie one probably would not have picked Davis as the cast member most likely to deliver the powerhouse moment. Not because the actress spends scant minutes on screen. Rather because in the play her character seemed more a dramatic device than a flesh-and-bone human. It wasnt only her race that made it feel like Shanley was making a point. It was her hard-to-buy reaction to Sister Aloysius suspicions. In the movie she is still black. She still responds in a dismaying way. Yet Davis -- just nominated for a Golden Globe for the turn -- makes her character utterly human. Her runny nose and tear-streaked cheek speak a mothers grief but also a childs hurt. In the midst of a cast that should have wowed more in the midst of a film that could have rattled more Davis sorrow upends all.

"Doubt and Gran Torino reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Doubt and Gran Torino reviewed. Doubt and Gran Torino reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 12 2008 537 PM Nun Better Meryl Streep in Doubt plus Clint Eastwood in Gran Torino. By Dana Stevens Meryl Streep as Sister Aloysius in Doubt Doubt (Miramax Films) has a flaw that movie critics will fall on like crazed Swedish vampires and most audiences wont care about at all Its a filmed play that feels like exactly that. Director John Patrick Shanley who adapted the screenplay from his own hit drama makes all the classic stage-to-screen mistakes. He writes in new characters to flesh out what was a spare four-person show; dutifully ""opens out"" the story by setting random scenes in public places; and hammers home thematic points with overly neat visual reinforcements. (When in trouble he cuts to a close-up of something a cross a cup of tea a trembling hand.) Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. So fine Cinematically Doubt is something of a dud. But if it remains a play its an ingeniously structured one with smart thought-provoking words spoken by fabulous actors and how often do most of us get to see one of those whether in three dimensions or two? If the foregoing disclaimer-laden rave didnt convince you let me put it another way In this corner in a nuns habit Meryl Streep. In that corner in a chasuble Philip Seymour Hoffman. Like another play recently translated to the screen Frost/Nixon Doubt turns head games into blood sport. Advertisement Its the early 60s just after the Catholic Church reforms of Vatican II and Father Flynn (Hoffman) is the hip new priest at a diocese in the Bronx. Hip by the standards of this hidebound lace-curtain Irish world means that he treats his congregation as human beings and writes sermons that bear some relation to their actual lives. Father Flynns popularity among the students at the local parochial school irks the principal Sister Aloysius (Streep). Shes an old-school Catholic ardently policing the line between secular and sacred. (Her dismissal of ""Frosty the Snowman"" as a ""pagan hymn"" is a comic high point.) A naive young teacher Sister James (Amy Adams who seems to be getting younger with each role) calls Sister Aloysius attention to a potential impropriety; Father Flynn has taken the parishs only black student (Joseph Foster II) under his wing calling him out of class for one-on-one meetings. Sister Aloysius jumps to the obvious conclusion but is it really so obvious? Thus begins an intricate spiral of insinuations accusations and counteraccusations that culminates in a standoff worthy of Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky. Streep plays her awful character (well great character; awful person) with compassion and loads of wit--she might be accused of having too much fun with the part but as with Mamma Mia I rather enjoyed being snowed under by the overbrimming force of Streeps personality. Viola Davis should be promptly FedEx-ed an Oscar for her one-scene showstopper as the boys mother. And Philip Seymour Hoffman manages to make the movies title mean something--only he knows what his character did with that little boy and hes not telling. Doubt would be my recommendation for the movie to see with your parents during this years holiday visit--not because priestly pedophilia is a hallmark of the Yuletide season but because this is the kind of film that sparks long conversations Not ""Thumbs up or thumbs down?"" but ""Did he do it?"" and ""Should she have pursued him?"" and that first of all religious and epistemological questions ""How can we ever know?"" Advertisement Slate V Critics on Doubt The Reader and The Day the Earth Stood Still Gran Torino(Warner Brothers) imagines what would happen if the classic Clint Eastwood hero--Dirty Harry Unforgivens Bill Munny A Fistful of Dollars Man With No Name--aged into a racist coot who sat on his front porch with a rifle and a six-pack decrying the invasion of his Detroit suburb by ""spooks"" and ""gooks."" Its not much of a stretch; many of Eastwoods iconic roles combine creeping racial anxiety with an element of vigilante justice. But Walt Kowalski a just-widowed Korean War vet with a grudge against his Hmong neighbors is Eastwoods furthest venture yet into the comic possibilities of his flintier-than-thou persona. Walt is a crank and a bigot but no fool; he can see that his nerdy teenage neighbor Thao (Bee Vang) is being pressured to join a violent neighborhood gang. So Walt scares the gangbangers away with a vintage weapon and a world-class squint. He strikes up a reluctant friendship with Thao who helps him with household tasks and envies Walts mint-condition 72 Gran Torino. Thao learns the art of asking out girls and the efficacy of a well-timed dirty joke. Walt learns that ""gooks""--at least the unarmed studious kind--are people too. As for ""spooks"" ... well the jury remains out apparently. Eastwood fans will love this movie but I confess that Ive never been one of them. The man does have a priceless way with a dry putdown (the winner here has to be ""Good day Puss-cake"") and as an actor hes a master at riffing on his own cinematic myth. But I cant get past his lead-footed direction and the ponderous Manicheanism of his worldview. Gran Torino ends with a fantasy of vigilante violence that squanders all the goodwill its main character has spent the movie accruing. This is the better by far of the two movies Eastwood has made this year a stripped-down alternative to the overupholstered Changeling. But both movies share a moral vision--bad guys as leering sickos good guys (and girls) as sacrificial lambs--that shuts down the possibility of any real well doubt.

(Photo Weta/Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox) Klaatu is a dream role for the beautifully blank Reeves since he doesnt even have to pretend to emote. Versed in the writing of Malcolm Gladwell he announces that humans will have to be destroyed because Earth has reached the tipping point although it isnt clear if he means war global warming or the ascendancy of snark. You treat the world as you treat each other he says. We can change pleads Dr. Helen. Despite being shot shelled and chased into New Jersey Klaatu believes her perhaps because he knows that Obama will soon be president. As he walked to his spaceship I had an overwhelming urge to call out Klaatu Keanu. Keanu Klaatu. Klaatu Obama. Obama Klaatu. Oprah Keanu Klaatu  John Patrick Shanleys film of his every-award-under-God-winning play Doubt is a heavy slab of dramaturgy dark-toned and somber yet intense as hell. Even opened up for the screen with air and trees and extra kids and nuns it has a primal theatrical compression One confrontation forces the next backs are driven against walls no points of view overlap. Big stuff is packed into small rooms with the roofs ready to explode. Its 1964 and Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) delivers a sermon to his congregation and the schoolboys in his charge asserting that doubt can be as sustaining as certainty and few understand what hes on aboutleast of all this Catholic schools severe principal Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Meryl Streep) who strides among the pews and classrooms watching for signs of disobedience. Wherefore she wonders this liberalism? There must be a sinister motive. A fresh-faced hopeful nun Sister James (Amy Adams) notices Father Flynn paying special attention to Donald (Joseph Foster II) the schools soleand very vulnerableAfrican-American student who returns from a private meeting with the priest looking shaken. No It couldnt be Yet she has a duty Sister Aloysius must be told. Whose voice is coming out of Streep? Its working-class Queens pinched and nasal Edith Bunker? Among these naturalistic actors the accent is distracting and so is the ever-pursed mouth. Yet Streep is riveting. She shows that Aloysius however monolithic her exterior is alive on the inside. The eyes dart about and the musings under her breathsighs asides exclamationssuggest an openness to the notion of human imperfectibility. Her interrogations of Hoffmans Flynn are seesaws of power. You can see his inner schism of which hes oblivious generosity (the boy needs a father figure) side by side with entitlement. He has what Aloysius doesnt the privilege of patriarchy. Hoffman has a tendency to stress the grotesqueness of his characters an instinct (possibly self-hating yet sadistic toward the audience) he mistakes for integrity. His Father Flynn is one of his best performances because all in all hes warm and likable. He doesnt believe hes a predator so we cant quite either. We understand why Sister James wants to see the good in his motives and Amy Adams with her cute little overbite that seems an extension of her eagerness makes Jamess struggle to shine extremely touching. There is a fourth major performance brief but breathtaking Viola Davis as Donalds mother. For many reasons Mrs. Millers son has not been at home in his world and the stairs to the next level keep getting knocked out from under him. Davis shows you a woman who in her desperation has moved beyond conventional morality who has become single-minded for the sake of what she sees as her boys very survival. The position at first appears unconscionable bordering on actionable. But in the end its her view that makes our hearts bleed. Roger Deakinss cinematography could hardly be crisper more focused. There is no escaping the starkness of this universe the white flesh the deep blacks of the nuns garb the gray skies the brown leaves kicked up by winds. To underline the spiritual discombobulation Shanley cuts from formal symmetrical compositions to sudden slanted ones. It is all on one level overdone and theres a toucha lightbulb that explodes at especially fraught moments as if overloaded by electrified synapsesthat might be pushing it. In adapting his play Shanley makes one serious mistake Having introduced Donald as a character he should have written a new scene in which the boy is questionedespecially since Joseph Foster makes such a deep impression in his few moments on-camera with waves of neediness coming out of that small frame. But Doubt is still overpowering; it took me a while when it was over to stop shaking. Its the dramatists business to sow doubt to set down points of view that cant be reconciled and Shanley makes visceral the notion that one can be right but never absolutely right that doubt might be our last best hope.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor December 13 2008 Save for later Saved Meryl Streep as Sister Aloysius in Doubt. Courtesy of Brigitte Lacombe/Andrew Schwartz          View Caption About video ads View Caption of John Patrick Shanleys prize-winning 2005 play ""Doubt"" which has been brought to the screen under his own direction is essentially an ensemble of voices. The two loudest belong to Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Meryl Streep) the principal of the Roman Catholic St. Nicholas school in the Bronx and to parish priest Father Brendan Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Sister Aloysius like the other nuns is bonneted and wears a voluminous habit. She represents in Shanleys view the bedrock traditionalism of the church and she rules her roost with a disciplinarians zeal. (She even bans the use of ballpoint pens in the school.) Father Flynn is her free-thinking adversary. The time is 1964 when the progressivism of priests such as Father Flynn was coming to the fore.It is also a time when the sexual abuse of minors in the church was still largely kept under wraps. The possibility of ""inappropriate behavior"" at St. Nicholas is the crux of ""Doubt"" and the title says it all. The film in fact opens with Father Flynns sermon on the nature of doubt - how doubt can sometimes be as intellectually sustaining as certainty. He himself comes under Sister Aloysiuss laserlike scrutiny when Sister James (Amy Adams) reports back to her that he may have taken sexual liberties with Donald (Joseph Foster II) his altar boy and the schools first black student.Despite the fact that Sister Aloysius accuses Father Flynn of abuse based on the flimsiest of evidence Shanley isnt interested in demonizing her. Neither is he interested in sanctifying Father Flynn no matter how sympathetic the parish priest might come across compared with his tormentor. The moral compass of ""Doubt"" is continually spinning. Shanley never makes clear to us whether Sister Aloysius is correct in her intuitions about the priest. He converts their drawn-out battle into a kind of cosmic whodunit. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? As such there may be less here than meets the eye - and ear. (Despite Shanleys attempts to ""open up"" his play it remains essentially a marathon talkfest.) Shanley doesnt really explore the unknowability of truth. He displays it. His did-he-or-didnt-he dramaturgy is riveting and gives off a lot of heat. Two of our finest actors raise the roof and thats a spectacle not worth missing. But philosophically if not dramatically Shanleys approach is reductive. By dancing around Father Flynns culpability hes teasing us with weighty issues of moral ambiguity. If he had come down squarely on one side or the other he might have provided us with more than an exalted guessing game. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Doubt Still the material works smashingly well on its own terms. Shanley certainly knows how to mount dramatic tension; every hesitation every sidelong glance is charged with meaning. At first Streeps performance might seem too mannered and preconceived but then again she is playing a highly mannered martinet. Its impossible to separate the technique of the actress from Sister Aloysiuss iron will.In the past Streep great as she is often seemed armored by her phenomenal facility. She had everything a performer could hope for - except spontaneity. But she has opened up her acting in the past few years and let down her guard. (Im thinking of performances in such films as ""The Hours"" ""Adaptation"" and ""A Prairie Home Companion."") Despite outward appearances I think her work in ""Doubt"" is likewise unfettered. To call her work as Sister Aloysius stagey is to miss the point For this nun all the worlds a stage.Hoffman is equally remarkable. It would have been easy for him to play Father Flynn as a wronged crusader. Instead he injects just enough ambiguity to make it maddeningly obvious that Sister Aloysius might be right. Delivering his sermons he is the resolute champion of the dispossessed that he always wanted to be. In private hes roiled by the contradictions of his character of his faith.There is a third major performance in ""Doubt."" As the mother of the altar boy Viola Davis has only one scene during which Sister Aloysius passes along her suspicions about Father Flynn. Davis plays the moment with such unbridled force that it resonates like a gong throughout the rest of the movie. Its a searing playlet all by itself.With its carefully calibrated three-act structure and its prestige-picture emphasis on the Big Issues ""Doubt"" is an anomaly in the current moviescape. But old-fashioned is not the same thing as old hat. Along with its disappointments and its narrowness of intellectual focus ""Doubt"" offers up the crackling pleasures of performance and a narrative that snaps shut like a mousetrap. Its the movie equivalent of a rousing night at the theater. Grade B+ (Rated PG-13 for thematic material.)

Mark Kelly looks back at the series which includes The Bourne Identity The Bourne Supremacy The Bourne Ultimatum and The Bourne Legacy. Image Universal Pictures/Everett Collection By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated July 29 2016 710 p.m. ET 77 COMMENTS Heres to truth in advertising. Go to the official website for "" Jason Bourne"" and what pops up immediately is a nonstop loop of riots raging fires car chases car crashes and brutishly ugly hand-to-hand combat interspersed with occasional glimpses of Matt Damons scowling countenance. Loops are by definition nonstop and the only way you can get rid of this one is to close the window. Still its a fair representation of the movie which puts its hero through a much longer loop of heavy-duty punishment interspersed with familiar sequences of omniscient electronic surveillance. Bourne used to be an anguished amnesiac. Now he remembers who he is but this fourth episode of the franchise forgot to make him human. Instead of using the last pieces of his self-discovery to open him up the film makes him more tightly shut down than ever a relentlessly grim avenger who wants to expose yet another nefarious program being hatched by a CIA that aspires to ""full-spectrum surveillance"" or watching everyone all the time. The chases are exciting up to a point; the director Paul Greengrass is a virtuoso filmmaker. But oh how they do vroom on. And when Bourne isnt being chased by a villainous agency assassin played by Vincent Cassel or by cops in various countries who do the agencys bidding hes being tracked by an array of technologies that give new meaning to whats become an obligatory phrase in high-tech thrillers ""Give me eyeballs on him."" (The most prominent snoops are the CIAs director Robert Dewey who is played by Tommy Lee Jones and his deputy Alicia Vikanders Heather Lee.) More Reviews Gleason Indignation Summer Movie Preview Interactive Watch trailers and read more about the summers crop of films Those all-seeing eyes of a digital god include as in previous episodes satellites a seeming infinitude of CCTV cameras and facial recognition systems that can pick Bournes face out of every crowd he tries to hide in. Omniscient surveillance has to be sure become an action-thriller staple even though it drains suspense by making chases easier just as computers have weakened police procedurals by making investigations easier. Whats newish here is the numbing amount of time the film spends on people halfway around the globe watching Bourne on myriad screens while giving his pursuers turn-by-turn directions that Waze users could only dream of. If you want to be generous toward the all-the-worlds-a-network screenplay that Mr. Greengrass wrote with the films editor Christopher Rouse its a lively sampling of themes ripped from the headlines or from classic films cyberwarfare; Edward Snowden; ""The Terminator"" (the villain drives a destructo truck); ""The Manchurian Candidate""; the cybersecurity conflict between personal privacy and public safety ( Riz Ahmed is Aaron Kalloor aka Steve Zuckerberg Gates a Silicon Valley titan whos been in bed with the CIA and wants to climb out). But if youre not feeling generous--and I leaned to the Not side after less than an hour--its a collection of repetitive tropes that Mr. Rouses pumped-up editing has turned into a two-hour version of a 100-yard dash. ( Barry Ackroyd did the flashy cinematography.) Watch a film clip from Jason Bourne starring Matt Damon and Julia Stiles. Photo Universal Pictures Mr. Damon is as always a strong presence; its remarkable that he can do such a buoyant man on Mars and such a dour Jason Bourne. Ms. Vikander taking over where Joan Allen left off makes up in appealing ambiguity what she lacks in Ms. Allens steeliness. Julia Stiles is back and welcome as Nicky Parsons. Mr. Jones has been made up--some of that is makeup isnt it?--to look like a cross between Lucifer and Nixon and he does his airy-authority number with well airy authority. He also gets--and earns--what is by my count the only laugh in the entire film. You dont go to a Bourne movie to laugh of course but neither do you go to get worn down. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download The Martian (2015) Matt Damons astronaut Mark Watney doesnt just struggle to survive on Mars after his crew assumes he has died during an epic storm and leaves him behind. He lives a rich intense life sustained by wry humor piercing intelligence and an irrepressible spirit of invention. Knowing the premise wont prepare you for the remarkable variety and complexity of this sci-fi extravaganza which Ridley Scott directed from Drew Goddards exuberant adaptation of the Andy Weir novel. 47 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Donald Trump Lashes Out at Michael Bloomberg GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

ABOUT THE MOVIEDoubt    1/2 (out of four)Stars Meryl Streep Philip Seymour Hoffman Amy Adams Viola DavisDirector John Patrick ShanleyDistributor Miramax FilmsRating PG-13 for thematic materialRunning time 1 hour 44 minutesOpens Friday in select cities By Claudia Puig USA TODAY ""So its happened"" Meryl Streep intones as the forbidding Sister Aloysius. With those three words Doubt strikes a deeper chill in our hearts than the creepiest thriller. Streep delivers a bravura performance as the razor-tongued nun who suspects a popular parish priest of pedophilia. Philip Seymour Hoffman is every bit her equal in his spectacular portrayal of the genial accused priest Father Flynn. VIDEO See the trailer for Doubt MORE Doubt inspired by directors Catholic schooling GALLERY The sisters of Saint Oscar There may not be two better actors working today To watch Hoffman and Streep match wits is exhilarating. Amy Adams is well-cast as the sweet-natured Sister James whose suspicions mount at the prodding of Sister Aloysius. Viola Davis is perfect as the mother of 12-year-old Donald whom Sister Aloysius suspects Father Flynn of molesting. Set in 1964 the film takes place before the priest abuse scandal came to light. But the audience cant help but approach the material with that information playing into their assessments of guilt or innocence. As the principal Sister Aloysius oversees her parochial school in draconian style. ""Its my job to outshine the fox in cleverness"" she says. Clever is an understatement She strikes fear in the hearts of students -- and even a few of her fellow nuns. Father Flynn in contrast is open-minded and affable. Their mutual dislike and distrust is apparent early on. When Sister James tells Sister Aloysius of a particular friendship between Father Flynn and Donald the schools first black student Sister Aloysius suspects the worst. She confronts the priest who roundly denies the charges and quick-fire dialogue centers on certainty intolerance fairness and authority. Much of the screenplay comes directly from the play by John Patrick Shanley who adapted it for the screen and also directs. He proves himself a gifted filmmaker. It is only his second film; 18 years have passed since his last effort Joe vs. the Volcano. What a difference great material makes. Doubt makes the most of the medium. Too many theatrical adaptations end up feeling stagy and stilted. Doubt builds upon the play contextualizing and broadening the landscape while remaining true to its essence. Evocative overhead shots symbolic visuals of a strong wind blowing around the school and additional characters help to amplify and distill Shanleys vision. A scene inside the convent with the nuns soberly eating their blandly nutritious dinner in near-silence is juxtaposed with a jocular Flynn and his fellow priests in what looks almost bacchanalian in contrast They chuckle swill their wine eat their beef blood-rare and puff on cigarettes. With those two scenes Doubt shows rather than expounds on the Catholic churchs male-dominated hierarchy. Shanley has constructed a stimulating film that tackles the concept of reasonable doubt rather than overtly focusing on guilt or innocence. By eloquently probing the state of uncertainty and its accompanying discomfort and confusion Doubt compels viewers to examine their own assumptions as they become caught up in this fascinating tale.

"Doubt Magnificent adaptation | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsDoubt Magnificent adaptation""We have nothing to fear but fear itself"" says the FDR quote neatly written on a nuns blackboard but the corrosive piety of Doubt presents a far more insidious threat.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Dec. 12 2008 Doubt (out of 4)Starring Meryl Streep Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams. Written and directed by John Patrick Shanley. 122 minutes. At the Varsity. PG ""We have nothing to fear but fear itself"" says the FDR quote neatly written on a nuns blackboard but the corrosive piety of Doubt presents a far more insidious threat.In magnificently adapting his award-winning play from stage to screen writer/director John Patrick Shanley has retained its most unsettling questions Who can we trust? Is morality absolute? He invites us to judge but then carefully lays out reasons why our verdict might be wrong even tragically so. He wants us to think something that runs counter to blind devotion.One of the two antagonists in the film is committing evil in the guise of good or attempting to. Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) the priest at St. Nicholas Church School in the Bronx is a beloved cleric and mentor. He may be sexually molesting one of his students a troubled black child named Donald Miller (Joseph Foster). Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) the schools officious principal suspects that Flynn is a pedophile but she has no proof only innuendo. She may well be wrong and she may also be motivated entirely by jealousy and spite.The year is 1964 a significant one for the Catholic Church. The sweeping reforms of Vatican II hailed by some and damned by others are starting to have an impact on the rank-and-file faithful.These ""winds of change"" blow through Doubt both literally through St. Nicholass drafty beams and figuratively in the growing restiveness towards Church strictures.Fr. Flynn represents the new order. He wants to help his students grow to be good men and not just pious Catholics. He has taken a particular interest in Donald an altar boy from a troubled home who has priestly aspirations.Also favouring change is Sister James (Amy Adams) whose history class blackboard bears the FDR quote above. New to her vows and also to teaching she obeys rules but longs for a Church that extends a loving hand not a reprimanding slap.Vocally in opposition is Sister Aloysius a habitual bully who reviews all reforms with suspicion. She doesnt accept the notion of a more liberal Catholicism.To her modernity is a sin represented even in small innovations like the ballpoint pen which she considers an affront to good handwriting.These opinions and resentments simmer just below the surface until the day Sister James reports an incident that casts suspicion on Fr. Flynn. Shes not sure of what she has seen but Sister Aloysius accepts it as gospel.The principal confronts the priest who angrily denies wrongdoing. But in the hothouse atmosphere of St. Nicholas accusation could be as good as conviction and denial the equal of admission.Another voice joins the growing din. Its Mrs. Miller (Viola Davis) Donalds mother. She meets with Sister Aloysius at the nuns request. Her response to the insinuations against Flynn cannot be anticipated and it heightens the unease. Can doing the wrong thing sometimes be right?Every element of Doubt is in perfect balance. Shanleys dialogue is economical but sharp his direction completely assured the production impeccably mounted.Shanley understands the Catholic Church very well especially the gender inequities that rank women far below men in the official hierarchy.A scene where Fr. Flynn usurps Sister Aloysiuss office desk while she and Sister James serve him tea speaks volumes about the resentments that can breed distrust.Anyone who ever attended a Catholic school could testify to the brilliance of the acting. Streeps pinched portrayal of Sister Aloysius is an Oscar-worthy study in tangled motivations a woman who has determined she will serve God even at risk of losing her immortal soul. She is capable of deceit but also of compassion as seen in her kindly attentions to a nun who is going blind.Hoffman and Adams are also impressive in their high-wire balance of devotion and humanity. But the films most notable performance comes in the brief scenes where Daviss anxious Mrs. Miller grapples with the suggestion that her son is at risk from a man he admires one who has helped him through difficult times.Anxiety twists her face as she weighs unproven risk against proven virtue.The words of the films opening sermon by Flynn seize her as they do us ""What do you do when youre not sure?""

Starring Meryl Streep Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams. Directed by John Patrick Shanley. (PG-13. 104 minutes. At Century 9.) ""Doubt"" is a commendable rendering of John Patrick Shanleys Pulitzer Prize-winning drama. That its faithful to its source should come as no surprise - Shanley directed the film and wrote the screenplay - and the first-rate cast ensures that if anybody in the future wants to see what ""Doubt"" was like in its own time the movie will stand as an unusually good record. Are you waiting now for the ""but"" for the qualification for the slight hedging of bets? Maybe there just isnt one at least not one based on anything tangibly wrong with the movie itself. Shanley who previously directed the fanciful ""Joe Versus the Volcano"" has no difficulty translating his play into film. His achievement here goes well beyond finding ways to ""open up"" scenes by shooting them outside. Shanley has an intuitive sense of finding the revealing angle and he knows how to let the psychological moment determine when to cut and what to show. Likewise his dialogue is just as crisp the scene writing just as brilliant and the overall situation just as compelling onscreen as onstage. Yet heres the problem - no not a problem just a faint reservation There seems to be something about the story itself thats better suited to the stage than the screen. ""Doubt"" embraces ambiguity. It turns on an event that may or may not have happened - did a priest molest a 12-year-old boy? - and the issue is never completely resolved. Onstage the lack of 100 percent certainty is a virtue an incitement to further speculation and thought. But film which has a way of literalizing everything it surveys is less forgiving of ambiguity. A movie can go anywhere so why not go into that room or go back in time? Why not show us someones thoughts? The result is that what was the chief virtue of the play becomes not a detriment but no longer a virtue. Just by changing medium through no fault of anyone concerned ""Doubt"" goes from something close to great to something merely very good. But very good is still very good and making a movie allows Shanley to re-create the setting for his film the Bronx in 1964. As in the play the characters speak with a type of New York accent that almost no longer exists but that thrived 45 years ago. Today Italian American New York accents (think Robert De Niro) and Jewish New York accents (think Barbara Boxer) still flourish but the accents in ""Doubt"" are the Irish American variety. The Irish for whatever reason dont talk like that anymore. Thus ""Doubt"" among its other virtues is a form of linguistic archaeology. The film takes place in and around a Catholic school. Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) the school principal is a nun straight out of a collective Catholic nightmare. Shes mean for the sake of meanness and shes unrelenting someone who makes school feel like prison. Through either ill will or uncanny perception she decides that there is something shady about the parishs likable liberal priest Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman). And so she instructs pretty young Sister James (Amy Adams) who is the essence of kindness to keep her eyes open. When something happens that hints at the vaguest whiff of impropriety Sister Aloysius pounces. She goes after the priest with everything she has. She is sure he is guilty though how much her certainty is based on reason and how much its based on wishful thinking and personal dislike is an open question. He is new-fashioned clergy a product of Vatican II and she is an old-fashioned nun who thinks ""Frosty the Snowman"" celebrates black magic and should be banned from the airwaves. Under the best of circumstances these two people were going to dislike each other. Much of the film pits the two in opposition with her attacking and him deflecting. As played by Streep Sister Aloysius is even more obnoxious and strident than Cherry Jones was in her Tony award-winning performance. Hoffman as the priest is more engaging - but that doesnt mean the sister isnt right about him. The truth of the movie is locked within Hoffmans performance Because any actor who plays the priest has to decide for himself whether the priest is guilty or not even as he conceals it the actor alone knows what happened. Hoffman seems to tip it one way though others might disagree. Adams provides one of the films singular advantages. She takes the role of Sister James which onstage seemed little more than a sounding board for Sister Aloysius and turns the young nun into someone quite specific and lovely. -- Advisory This film contains adult subject matter.

Doubt. (PG-13) Miramax (104 min.) Directed by John Patrick Shanley. With Philip Seymour Hoffman Meryl Streep Amy Adams. Opens Friday at theaters in New York. THREE AND A HALF STARS It is 1964 in the Bronx and in the parish of St. Nicholas the good nuns and priests are busy teaching history and giving homilies. Yet the one thing we do not hear them lecture on is the Seven Deadly Sins. Perhaps it is because they themselves are guilty of so many of them. Sister Aloysius the quick-to-anger principal of the school is certainly full of wrath. And chubby Father Flynn delighting in his dinners of rare roast beef and Seagrams is no stranger to gluttony. But there are hints of other sins at St. Nicholas too. And absolution will not come easily. When we first saw this situation unfold in ""Doubt"" it was onstage and the cast was sharply limited -- Sister Aloysius Father Flynn a young nun and the mother of a (possibly) molested boy. It was the question of that molestation that was the plays point -- not only what the truth was but whether you could ever truly know it. Its an intellectual philosophical approach to a brutally painful subject yet playwright John Patrick Shanley never lost sight of the characters humanity (or the need for an occasional touch of humor). Shanley has held on to this in his movie adaptation while drastically opening the play up. Ironically as the author of the play he doesnt approach the material with the reverence a new screenwriter would; fresh characters are added incidents interpolated and entirely new sequences brought in. And yet the few personalities who were at the center of this Pulitzer Prize winner remain there. Chief among them are Meryl Streep as the formidable ""dragon"" who runs her parochial school like a prison and Philip Seymour Hoffman as the cheerful priest who preaches unconditional love. On paper they are constructs symbols of the old church and the new penance and forgiveness. On the screen they are blazingly alive. Thats due to the actors of course two of our finest. Hoffman gets the showier part perhaps -- building up over the course of the film to an explosion of crimson-faced anger. But the inflexible Streep is every bit his equal -- holding her rosary as tightly as a club peering through her glasses as if she had finally trapped sin under a microscope. There are other good actors here -- including Amy Adams as the desperately sweet Sr. James and Viola Davis as the boys mother (whose heartbreaking response to the events is anything but predictable). But Hoffman and Streep are breathtaking as they go to battle -- each convinced that the other is an unspeakable monster. As a playwright Shanley juggled ambiguities; as a filmmaker hes a bit less subtle in his effects. Its not enough for example to allude to the winds of change coming to stir up the church; we now have literal winds blowing gale force. Theres also a brief shot of a stained-glass window -- a representation of the eye of God -- that seems to plant too big a clue. But those are small faults in a film thats rich in dialogue (but never talky) full of ideas (but never dry). Crammed with great performances and authentic period detail (you can almost smell the cafeteria food and the mimeograph ink) its a fine adaptation of a provocative play. Shanley should feel proud of himself. But not too proud -- after all thats a deadly sin too. Rating note The film contains adult subject matter.

Streep will no doubt score her record 13th Oscar nomination as Best Actress for Sister Aloysius who declares war on the parish priest Father Brendan. Played by Philip Seymour Hoffman Brendan appears more than ready for the battle. Already suspicious of the priests embrace of the Vatican II reforms in his liberal sermons the archly conservative sister - who finds ballpoint pens a newfangled abomination - senses ammunition when the naive Sister James (Amy Adams) tells her that the schools first black student an altar boy returned from the rectory with the smell of alcohol on his breath. Sister Aloysius quickly concludes that her nemesis behaved improperly with Donald Miller (Joseph Foster II). And so might a contemporary audience that has heard countless stories of sexual abuse by priests over the past decade. But Shanleys Pulitzer-winning play - which he has adapted for the screen and also directed - is called ""Doubt"" for a reason. The movies crux is Sister Aloysius trying to pin down the charming priest - and its impossible to figure out from the text or Hoffmans skillful performance whether hes guilty as charged or merely the victim of the sisters witch hunt. (Shanley hasnt denied speculation that the play is an allegory about the run-up to our current war in Iraq.) Father Brendan admits taking a special interest in the boy who is in a difficult situation because of his race. But hes admitting nothing even as the sisters efforts to compel a confession escalate. While Hoffman is warmer here than in any previous screen role Streep (stepping in for Cherry Jones who created the role onstage) dominates the proceedings except for a single amazing scene. It involves not the priest but a conversation between the sister and the boys mother (Viola Davis) as they walk outside on a winter day. The mother announces a revelation that stuns the seemingly unflappable sister into momentary silence - and in her single scene Davis acts Streep right off the screen. ""Doubt"" is a feast of great acting although in the final analysis its a filmed stage play rather than a brilliant movie. Among other things Shanley directing for the first time since the unfortunate ""Joe Versus the Volcano"" nearly two decades ago badly overworks the metaphoric winds that howl outside the school. DOUBT Acting duel in The Bronx. Running time 104 minutes. Rated PG-13 (references to pedophilia). At the Cinema 1 the Lincoln Square the Chelsea and the Angelika.

Directing the film of ""Doubt"" Shanley is able to put an even finer point on his Tony-and Pulitzer-winning play about suspicion and guilt at a Bronx Catholic grade school in 1964. It also helps to have Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman turning his artful-ly oblique dialogue into spider webs of insinuation. Streep is Sister Aloysius a mother superior at St. Nicholas parish whose starchy judgment stops at her own failings. One of those according to the schools popular priest Father Flynn (Hoffman) is a resentment of the churchs patriarchal structure. Another is a dangerous confidence in her moral certitude. That last one kicks in when a young nun (Amy Adams) thinks she sees evidence of impropriety between the priest and the schools first black student. A hint of scandal is all Sister Aloysius needs to wage a quiet battle against Flynn. Streep and Hoffman work even their silences like grand speeches (each have redrimmed eyes as if the strain of finding the truth could make them wail at any moment). And when it comes to Streep its nice to see the fluffernut from ""Mamma Mia"" gone entirely. Though several moments could be seen as backing one side of the debate -- notably a scene with the boys mother (Viola Davis in a knockout one-scene turn) -- Shanley paints a shaded picture where even a final spontaneous act of contrition contains multitudes of meaning.

Being considered one of the worlds most talented actors is a cage. Tom Hanks Leonardo DiCaprio and Nicole Kidman are imprisoned in it shunning pleasure in favor of stiff saintly roles that will get them paraded down the Academys red carpet. But Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman her co-star here are jail-breakers seeking escapism two large talents who duly turn in Serious Performances only to sneak out past curfew and sing ABBA co-star with Roseanne Barr or help adventurous filmmakers like Charlie Kaufman get funding. They make average films great. Writer-director John Patrick Shanleys Doubt however is an average film hailed as great. Shanley is a smart playwright who in 1990 made a surprisingly enjoyable film called Joe Versus the Volcano (coincidentally the last time Hanks smiled). In the 18 years between his first film and his second hes been bridled by expectations. Doubt is a ripe poisoned play about hierarchy resentment and protection in which a pathologically popular parish priest (Hoffman) is suspected by Sister Aloysius (Streep) a principal of molesting their schools only black student (Joseph Foster). Shanley cant resist filmmaking 101 tricks like leaden symbolism and askew camera angles meant to reflect his characters crooked ethics; Streep and Hoffman contradict him by turning in perfect performances that seem to wink at the melodrama like a parlor magician twiddling his mustache before making a rabbit disappear. I must mention Viola Davis whose searing scene as the boys working class mother is sure to get her an Oscar nomination. Its a plum role that won originator Adriane Lenox a Tony. Davis does it justice though I suspect her moment of glory will also be remembered for her runny nose--an uncalculated flourish that neither Hanks DiCaprio nor Kidman would dare.

"Doubt has a crisis of faith - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEWS Doubt has a crisis of faithDecember 12 2008|KENNETH TURAN | MOVIE CRITIC ""Doubt"" is a film with many fine elements but its director John Patrick Shanley doesnt seem to trust them. Which is rather odd because it was Shanley who wrote both the script and the play on which its based.That play gripping enough to win four Tonys and the Pulitzer Prize and attract film stars such as Meryl Streep Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams is set in the pivotal year of 1964 in St. Nicholas a Catholic church and school in the Bronx.It details a conflict between the churchs Father Flynn (Hoffman) and the schools principal Sister Aloysius (Streep) about the direction of the Catholic faith in general and the fate of one 12-year-old altar boy in particular.Shanley the writer has carefully constructed this drama like the delicately balanced house of cards it is. On the stage as well as on the screen ""Doubt"" is a highly polished piece of business with every speech and every action calculated for maximum effect a well-made play if ever there was one.Although a did-he-or-didnt-he mystery is ""Doubts"" central plot mechanism the play and the film are about a whole lot more. Philosophical questions about conservative versus progressive religious values about rigidity versus openness and suspicion versus proof about how far its appropriate to go when you are sure you are right are what got Shanley to write the piece in the first place.But in the process of opening this story up of changing it from a four-actor stage play to a film with multiple characters and numerous extras Shanley seems to have lost a certain amount of faith in what hed written. As a director hes ended up pushing the drama harder than he needs to. He hasnt done anything fatal but he has tampered with and hampered it.For one thing Shanley has chosen to bring too much of the outside world into St. Nicholas cloistered halls. Having a cat physically catch a mouse at a key juncture is too literal a metaphor by half and ""Doubt"" threatens to become meteorologically overwrought by putting all kinds of wind rain and even thunder into the story whenever it feels the proceedings wont work on their own.The only place where this kind of literalism works is ""Doubts"" setting. Cinematographer Roger Deakins production designer David Gropman and costume designer Ann Roth have combined to carefully re-create the look of the Bronx and the bonnet-wearing Sisters of Charity who call the borough home. An image of the nightgowned nuns coming out of their rooms en masse in the early morning is especially fine.Inhabiting this world are two particularly well-matched antagonists. Streeps Sister Aloysius is the showier role a literal holy terror who hasnt smiled since Pius XII was pope and inflicts old school discipline as disapproval and suspicion oozes from every pore. Its a part that verges on caricature but Streep is adept at walking up to that line without crossing over.In the other corner is Father Flynn. As played by Hoffman who looks just fleshy enough to be Pat OBriens younger brother Father Flynn is a priest who likes his pleasures whether it be rare beef and red wine at dinner or three lumps of sugar in his tea.These two are not just poles apart personally they differ on the future of the church. Sister Aloysius is old-fashioned enough to consider ""Frosty the Snowman"" a pagan anthem (really) while Father Flynn thinks ""Its a new time Sister the church needs to change.""This philosophical difference is heightened by a conflict over the situation of one particular boy 12-year-old Donald Miller (Joseph Foster II) the schools first black student.Father Flynn takes an interest saying he just wants to protect the friendless boy but Sister Aloysius suspects that something akin to molestation might be going on. Father Flynn has a plausible answer for everything but just because we feel closer to his worldview doesnt mean he is without blame. As Sister Aloysius goes into overdrive Hoffmans nuanced performance gives nothing away.It means no disrespect to Amy Adams convincing as the innocent Sister James the new nun on the block to say that if anyone comes close to stealing the picture from Streep and Hoffman it is the superb Viola Davis as Donalds mother Mrs. Miller.The scene between the concerned Mrs. Miller and the worried Sister Aloysius is ""Doubts"" high point largely because Davis best known for ""Antwone Fisher"" brings a sense of decency urgency and even fear to her rending performance. The concerns of the real world not the cloistered one walk into the film with her and that makes quite a difference.--kenneth.turanlatimes.com--DoubtMPAA rating PG-13 for thematic materialRunning time 1 hour 44 minutesPlaying In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESNo Doubt Meryl Streep is a contenderJanuary 28 2009Viola Davis supporting actress for DoubtJanuary 23 2009`Doubt dwarfed and yet still sureSeptember 29 2006Dilemmas of suspicion and DoubtMarch 14 2005Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/reviews/movies/la-et-doubt12-2008dec12,0,7000926.story",200,doubt26,doubt,latimes

"Doubt stars Meryl Streep Philip Seymour Hoffman Amy Adams (3 1/2 stars) - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Doubt stars Meryl Streep Philip Seymour Hoffman Amy Adams (3 1/2 stars) Michael PhillipsTribune critic One of the great climaxes in modern romantic comedy arrives at the end of ""Moonstruck."" Remember the scene? Everyones sitting around that luscious-looking Brooklyn brownstone kitchen sorting out complications and revealing their true feelings and then all issues become resolved with a magical Shakespearean touch. The grandfather weeps. ""Im confused"" he explains getting what remains one of the biggest single laughs Ive ever heard in a movie theater. The sequence is stagy in the extreme and you know what? No one cares. The satisfactions of that scene are endless. Audiences are perfectly happy to watch characters interact in a room if the words are worth the trouble and the actors energize whats underneath and the director knows how to finesse it all. John Patrick Shanley wrote ""Moonstruck."" More recently he won a Pulitzer Prize for ""Doubt"" his most widely produced play to date a beautifully constructed four-character drama set in 1964 in a Catholic school in the Bronx. Shanley has adapted slightly expanded and directed his play for the screen and while it helps to enjoy the old-school dramaturgy and knowing theatrical craftsmanship of the piece Im probably not alone in my surprise at how well the results work on screen. If more screen versions of plays had this kind of punch wed have fewer ""Proof""s and more ""Doubt""s.You can diagram the combatants roles. Meryl Streeps Sister Aloysius represents fearsome law and dogmatic order. The world in her eyes is going to hell each new day the students at St. Nicholas are allowed to use ballpoint pens (""penmanship is dying all across this country""). Yet her single-mindedness is far from simple-minded. Philip Seymour Hoffmans Father Flynn represents the new Vatican II theology looser and more companionable to the students. Sister James played by Amy Adams is the lamb caught between two wolves whose suspicion that Father Flynn may have entered into an improper or abusive relationship with a 12-year-old student--the sole African-American in a sea of Irish and Italians--provides ""Doubt"" with its narrative suspense.Onstage the material worked like Catholic gangbusters evoking its time and place mixing drama with Shanleys trademark verbal wit. The play was deceptive however; without a first-rate performer in the role of Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones first among first-raters originated the part) ""Doubt"" risked tipping into caricature automatically cheapening its dramatic values to say nothing of its moral questions.While Streep has a tiny bit too much fun with some of her characters excesses shes awfully good. So is Hoffman who walks a fine line between obvious guilt and possible innocence. So is Adams whose naivete stays this side of the wrong kind of comedy. And in a key wrenching scene Viola Davis--who plays the mother of the student at risk--makes complicated emotional sense of a woman caught in an unwinnable untenable position.This is Shanleys second feature as director; the first ""Joe Versus the Volcano"" has its defenders (not me). With ""Doubt"" he makes a few dubious visual choices to heighten the stakes in rather a cheap way tilted off-kilter framing; conveniently timed bursts of rain and thunder coming down from the angry heavens. Fresh off the gleeful camping trip that was ""Mamma Mia"" Streep cannot resist a certain portion of ham. Yet every scene in ""Doubt"" photographed in gorgeous stern tones by the great Roger Deakins feels finely calibrated. While it would be a mistake to make too much of it the film--full disclosure I headed the Pulitzer drama jury the year the play won its Pulitzer--suggests that as a director Shanley has learned a lot since ""Joe Versus the Volcano."" We already knew he could write. mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating PG-13 (for thematic material).Running time 144.Opening Dec. 12.Starring Meryl Streep (Sister Aloysius Beauvier); Philip Seymour Hoffman (Father Flynn); Amy Adams (Sister James); Viola Davis (Mrs. Miller).Written and directed by John Patrick Shanley based on his play; photographed by Roger Deakins; edited by Dylan Tichenor; music by Howard Shore; production design by David Gropman; produced by Scott Rudin and Mark Roybal.

Miramax Films hide caption toggle caption Miramax Films Shouts And Murmurs Donald Millers mother (Viola Davis) says more with less force. Miramax Films Somewhere in its journey from stage to screen John Patrick Shanleys 2005 Pulitzer-winner Doubt a Parable became simply Doubt losing the qualifier that follows that titular comma along with the claim to universality that went with it. Not surprising of course. Parables are more or less de rigueur on stage where the idea is to approximate reality not duplicate it. Film being a more literal medium tends to bring metaphors crashing to earth when it renders them physical and specific. And thats more or less what happens to Shanleys moral guessing game once the story is removed from its onstage Everyschool and set down in a solid stolid parochial academy in the Bronx in 1964. Meryl Streeps Sister Aloysius a strict disciplinarian who rushes to shut windows whenever she finds them open a crack -- lest some metaphorical gust of fresh air intrude on her musty domain -- terrifies not just the students but also her fellow nuns. And shes less than fond of the newly arrived Father Flynn (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) who rather likes the breezes of change that are blustering outdoors. The two are perpetually at odds and not just over what turns out to be relentlessly symbolic weather. They disagree on teaching -- she the doctrinaire old knuckle-rapper he the warm inspiring type -- and also on how best to shepherd their young charges past extracurricular difficulties. When Father Flynn takes a new student -- the schools only black child -- under his protective wing correctly surmising that hell be subjected to hazing Sister Aloysius worries about the extent of his interest in the lad and with very little concrete evidence to go on heads straight into pederasty-in-the-priesthood territory. Ugly confrontations ensue with each battle leaving a few more doubts lingering in the air. Doubt cast a long moral shadow on Broadway but seems blunter on screen largely because Shanleys fussy directorial notions -- a cat portentously brought in to catch a mouse skittering down school hallways for instance -- are less nuanced than the religious and moral arguments hes given his principal characters. It doesnt help that he encourages stridency from Streep and bluster from Hoffman which results in theatrical shouting matches where an anguished cinematic hush would almost certainly prove more effective. The films most wrenching performance in fact comes from Viola Davis who plays the boys worried mother as a woman who is in no position to raise her voice even when articulating a startlingly unexpected parental position on what may have transpired between the priest and her son. The others argue strenuously and occasionally even eloquently to ever-diminishing effect; Davis speaks plainly and quietly and leaves not a shadow of a doubt that the moral high ground is a treacherous spot to occupy in the real world.

Granted when those actors include Meryl Streep Philip Seymour Hoffman Amy Adams and Viola Davis that doesnt seem like much of a complaint. More of a quibble. All could easily be nominated for Oscars; Streep and Davis look like locks. It just would have been nice to see them ease up a little especially Streep and let the drama unfold more like a movie instead of a filmed version of a play. The film takes place in the Bronx in 1964 at a Catholic school ruled with an iron fist by Sister Aloysius (Streep). Shes incredibly strict sometimes comically so and one of those people who are so convinced of their ability to find the truth in any given circumstance that such things as facts and proof arent necessary. So when she suspects Father Flynn (Hoffman) of having or at least trying to create an improper relationship with a boy named Donald (Joseph Foster) she will brook no argument otherwise. Donald is the only Black student in the school and Father Flynn takes a special interest in his welfare. How special is the question at the heart of the matter. How does Sister Aloysius know something improper is taking place? There are small clues that perhaps something is amiss. But mostly she just knows. Sister Aloysius employs the help of a meek young nun Sister James (Adams). She leans on Sister James to be more of a disciplinarian - a bit with her hanging a picture of the pope on the board (""it doesnt matter which one"") for reasons other than devotion and decoration is priceless. But shes also cultivating an ally. Father Flynn meanwhile is much earthier. He coaches the boys basketball team drinks beer at dinner with the other priests and is in favor of including secular songs in the Christmas pageant. He considers Sister Aloysius an impediment to progress. Its all leading to a showdown of course a showdown between Sister Aloysius and Father Flynn - or more to the point Streep and Hoffman. And its a beauty the two of them going toe-to-toe pulling out all the tricks in the Serious Actors Toolbox so much so that you can practically see it stashed in the corner. Its a powerhouse scene but its also expected. Whats not expected is the scene between Sister Aloysius and Donalds mother Mrs. Miller (Davis). Millers reaction goes from passive to resigned to searing. Even Sister Aloysius and Streep herself seem surprised. In its way its even more powerful than the heavyweight bout between Streep and Hoffman and its the most genuine scene in the film - it feels the least staged anyway - because it doesnt unfold with resigned certainty. Maybe thats what Shanleys film adaptation needs. A little more surprise a little more spontaneity - a little more doubt. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

This man was a compulsive flirt who couldnt get within feet of a woman without coming on to her so I wasnt altogether surprised that he had come under suspicion. But long before an internal inquiry cleared him of all charges -- and unearthed his mentally unstable accusers impressive history of workplace mayhem -- many in the powerful local feminist community had written him off as guilty by virtue of sleazy character. The fallout from this case measured in reckless disregard for due process and subsequent private misery all round made a deep impression on me. So I came with up-front sympathy to John Patrick Shanleys Doubt the film adaptation of his award-winning play about an old-school Catholic nun who goes after a priest she suspects of sexual abuse.In a hyper-reactive news culture increasingly ruled by caffeinated bloggers who prize speed of coverage over the search for evidence any movie that questions public rushes to judgment wins points going in. But Doubt is only marginally and tendentiously about moral uncertainty -- its more about the sins of a nosy old biddy who pulls out the stops when going through the official channels of a male-dominated Catholic Church would get her nowhere. With its bristling topicality ritzy cast and the added bonus of Roger Deakins gracefully bleak cinematography Doubt is being squired around town as prime Oscar bait. But in Shanleys hands it only looks deep. Where the complication of received ideas might roam free callow provocation rules ushered in periodically by waves of premonitory weather. Just for starters a sleeting rain coats the claustrophobic Bronx parochial school where timid young Sister James (Amy Adams) unnerved by what looks like unusually close contact between the schools well-liked priest Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and its first black pupil (Joseph Foster II) reports her misgivings to the school principal Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep). A twitchy termagant swathed in fearsome bonnet and black taffeta (she looks like something out of Chicken Run) the older nun has been biding her time and before you can say independent inquiry off she bustles in paranoid overdrive to grind the machinery of blind justice into gear. Written in 2005 at the height of the stories about the Catholic Churchs sex-abuse scandals Shanleys play is set in the mid-1960s with Vatican II and backwash from the counterculture poised to liberalize what the playwright plainly regards as a joylessly authoritarian establishment. The elephant in the room is several decades in between of rampant sexual abuse by a celibate priesthood and the fascinating question buried deep under the clever blather of Doubt is whether it was old-school rigidity that upheld enforced celibacy or the new laxity that allowed this tragedy to unfold under the noses of higher-ups who didnt want to know that they knew. Father Flynn is a jolly free-spirited fellow who cant rustle his cassock without being cued in by winds of progressive change. But he is seen furtively stuffing a boys undershirt into a locker while Sister Aloysius rabid digging however unethically conducted turns up the interesting news that he has been moved from one parish to another in five years.Id say that was reasonable cause for further research. For Shanley though the rather salient question of whether Father Flynn has transgressed matters less than whether the good sister has the right to investigate his behavior at all. Judging from the number of times the camera wanders up to holy ceilings perhaps only the Almighty can say for sure. Back on Earth and staking his claim for keeping an open mind Shanley pushes moral relativism as far as it will go which is all the way to preposterous via obnoxious in a key scene between Sister Aloysius and the black boys mother which is meant to make us go ""Aaaah"" but made me go ""What?""  If Doubt has a point to make about not rushing to judgment it is overwhelmed by the force of Shanleys profound ambivalence toward women. True he throws in a biographical tidbit or two to reassure us that Sister Aloysius is not just a man-hating dried-up old cartoon virgin. But she sure behaves like one and for that she must be punished with a final meteorological flourish in which the anguished old nun sits surrounded by snow and ice. Its telling that the movie is dedicated to the real-life Sister James Shanleys history teacher. But its history that lets Shanley down Inadvertently Doubt shows us that there are limits to an open mind. Knowing what we know now I wish there had been more vigilant old bats around like Sister Aloysius to shield Catholic children from the predators within.

"Doubt | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; doubt ) Doubt (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Its one of lifes bitter ironies that one of the first things lost to moral certainty is the capacity for compassion. Righteousness is a cold hard position and an unshakeable one. It allows no room for one of the most basic tenants of human existence doubt. Faith exists not in counterpoint to certainty but to doubt. And those in religious institutions who wish to commune with their fellows must never lose sight of the fact that doubt defines and binds us. Few of us have the capacity to defend a position of uncompromising certainty. Doubt John Patrick Shanleys screen adaptation of his Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award winning play is the story of doubt and certainty in direct conflict. And its a tale that enters a moral quagmire from which it never fully emerges. Those seeking clear answers to difficult questions will not find them here. Movies often provide resolution and catharsis. These are rarely qualities uncovered in real life situations and that is mirrored here. One is likely to leave Doubt pondering all that has transpired but perhaps no closer to ""truth"" than any of the characters are. Not since David Mamets Oleanna has a play-to-film translation offered such difficult to digest intellectual substance. The setting is simple The Saint Nicholas Church School in the Bronx. Its late autumn 1964 with Christmas approaching. There are four principal characters Father Brendan Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) the progressive priest who presides over the school and its church; Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Meryl Streep) the old-school nun who sees sin and wrongdoing everywhere; Sister James (Amy Adams) the young and idealistic newcomer; and Mrs. Muller (Viola Davis) the mother of a boy who becomes central to the conflict. The nature of the controversy is clear Did Father Flynn engage in an improper relationship with student Donald Muller (Joseph Foster)? Flynn denies the accusation but Sister Aloysius proclaims no doubt as to his guilt. The two face off against one another neither giving ground with Sister James caught in the middle taking the role of the audience. She hears and sees the evidence for and against Father Flynn and like those of us watching the movie arrives at a conclusion but can never be certain that her belief is correct. Doubt is a showcase for its four main actors. It seems that Meryl Streep receives an acting nomination for every role in which she appears and its no wonder. She takes the time to understand every character she plays and no matter what part she accepts her portrayal comes with a complete conviction that includes posture body language mannerisms physical appearance and accent. (You can even see this in fluff like Mamma Mia) As Sister Aloysius Streep is in top form. The actress vanishes into the nuns habit and what emerges is a character of nearly monstrous dimensions in her unshakeable moral certainty. One sees her in her dark costume as a modern-day representation of those paragons of virtue who condemned witches to burn during the Salem Witch Trials. Philip Seymour Hoffman is perhaps one of the few working actors today who can hold his own in a scene with Streep and thats precisely what he does because the movie would fall apart if he was unable to. His portrayal of Father Flynn is strong and confident showing a great depth of compassion but just enough uncertainty to make us wonder. Amy Adams has a less showy part but is quietly impressive. She is caught in the middle and considering her position provides the most propitious point of entry for the viewer. Viola Davis has the least screen time of the main four but her single extended scene is wrenching and reveals key information about the situation as well as a startling admission. Beginning with this paragraph the rest of the review is written with the expectation that readers have some familiarity with Doubt (either the play or the movie). Is the term ""spoiler"" appropriate for a story in which uncertainty is a primary characteristic and plot twists dont really apply? Perhaps not but Im providing this warning to allow those who wish to see the movie unfiltered to pause here and come back later. Some of what follows is speculation. The central question of Doubt relates to the nature of the relationship between Father Flynn and Donald. There are many possibilities and the film provides evidence to support nearly every one of them. Shanley (directing for the first time since Joe Versus the Volcano) does not stack the deck and more importantly he does not provide an impregnable truth. (But could one expect anything different from a film with the title Doubt?) The film takes place in an era when priests were implicitly trusted but during which we know based on current news reports that such trust was abused in some cases. As a result of what has been revealed over the years both in court and in films like Deliver us from Evil there is now a tendency to believe that priests are guilty until proven innocent. By highlighting Father Flynns love of pressed wildflowers and perfectly groomed nails it is possible that Shanley may be providing clues about Flynns sexuality. We know from the conversation between Sister Aloysius and Mrs. Muller that Donald has shown homosexual tendencies. This would provide a common bond between Father Flynn and Donald - not a sexual liaison but one of compassion and kinship. Father Flynn understands and wants to impart that understanding to a boy who is all alone (not only is he gay but hes the only black student in an all-white school). My sense is that there is nothing inappropriate in the relationship but its not cut-and-dried and there are indications that all of Father Flynns past associations may not have been as innocent. Others may process the same information differently and arrive at another conclusion. Thats the beauty of the films screenplay and acting. It does not dictate. It demands that each viewer make up his or her own mind. Some may call this unsatisfying and manipulative. I call it brilliant. As hot-button an issue as is pedophilia in the priesthood Doubt deals in subtleties. It asks questions about faith. It acknowledges the importance of vigilance yet at the same time cautions against embracing certainty because such an action curtails the search for truth. Theres a lot here to digest but its not meaningless philosophizing. These characters and the pain of their circumstances become visceral. They are people not abstractions. They merit understanding pity and anger. Doubt is an intellectually and emotionally exhausting and engrossing experience. It is drama of the highest caliber shaped by words and characters and directed with a simplicity that stands in stark contrast to the complexity of the people and issues on screen.

From the first minute you lay eyes on her as an owlish vise-lipped anally retentive nun named Sister Aloysius Beauvier in a Catholic primary school in the Bronx youre aware that shes acting. She acts and acts and when she has nothing to say reacting to others she acts some more. Philip Seymour Hoffman as Father Brendan Flynn the smiling softhearted priest she falsely accuses of child molestation refusing to change her mind about his alleged guilt even though she cannot prove it doesnt offer much balance. Hes busy playing the charisma card. Together theyre acting all over the place. Most unfortunate if you ask me because it makes the important issues raised but unresolved look even phonier than they should be. This nun is a vicious mean-spirited bully. When Cherry Jones played her on Broadway I dont remember her being so tightly coiled or morally superior. She allowed you to believe she was a nun with doubts. Ms. Streep is so nasty that she stalks the aisles of the church during actual Mass whacking her students across the back of their heads like shes smashing spiders. Shes just plain hateful and the priest who allows her to destroy him without a fight is just plain wimpy. In the end when Sister Aloysius admits she might have made a mistake you already dislike her so much that you dont much care. Her anguish is more like crocodile tears. Theres no sympathy for cruelty hiding behind a habit. Set in the year Kennedy was assassinated the movie is about spiritual isolation in a time of despair and fear. The warm priest is a man of the cloth offering hope and friendship to the schools first black student. The cold nun is the schools principal a disillusioned bigot who even interrupts the classes taught by other sisters to dish out harsher disciplines to their students. Hes like Bing Crosby in The Bells of St. Marys but shes not Ingrid Bergman. Shes more like the crones who tortured Jane Eyre. Self-righteous and hard shes clearly jealous of Father Flynn whose compassion and camaraderie make him a favorite among his students. Another nun naive and inexperienced played by Amy Adams (who gives the best performance in the film) is the one who reports the priests private consultation with the disturbed boy in his rectory planting the first seeds of doubt in Sister Aloysius suspicious mind. ""The students are uniformly terrified of you"" he says. ""Yes"" she snarls without regret ""thats how it works."" A firm believer in progressive education and in a friendly bond between the clergy and congregation he smokes takes three lumps of sugar in his tea and introduces ""Frosty the Snowman"" into the Christmas pageant. A metaphor for old-world dogma masquerading as virtue she forsakes her own vows to go outside the church to crucify him. At the roots of a flawed but well-written piece this is what I find wrong with Doubt. Mr. Shanley obviously knows more than I do but unless I missed something Roman Catholic priests have always enjoyed all the freedom and power in the church. Nuns are like office wives doing the work and keeping their mouths shut. In the pecking order the Fathers report to a much higher authority. Nuns have no control over priests. In the recent Boston church pedophile scandals the nuns were not the ones who reported the abuses. Even if Father Flynn was guilty of an indiscretion in his past as the film vaguely implies it would be none of Sister Aloysius business. The crisis of faith faced by everyone in Doubt raises the biggest doubt of all. rreedobserver.com Comment Filed under Amy Adams Doubt Meryl Streep movie On the Town Philip Seymour Hoffman Trending Now Wikileaks Proves Primary Was Rigged DNC Undermined Democracy Politics Why ISIS Sees an Elderly Priest as a Threat to the Caliphate Politics Wikileaks Dismantling of DNC Is Clear Attack by Putin on Clinton Politics Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://www.observer.com/2008/o2/sister-act,200,doubt36,doubt,observer

By Anthony Lane Mickey Rourke as Randy (the Ram) Robinson in Darren Aronofskys movie.   Credit Illustration by Quickhoney For some years Mickey Rourke was just about my favorite movie star. This was not an easy stance to take. The body of the mans work was dismayingly thin and the body of good work from ""Rumble Fish"" onward could be counted on the knuckles of one fist. As for the body of the man it swelled from taut and slender to something so bulbous and spongiform that those of us who had thrilled to Boogie his cocky romancer in ""Diner"" could only wince and look away. Yet I insist there was a time when Rourke demanded to be looked at catching and holding your eye no less grippingly than the young De Niro. Sweetness and menace were folded up in him--in the way that he angled himself at the world as if both sure of his place within it and deeper down afraid that it might still spit him out. Hence the voice never a bellow or a screech nor yet a Brando-haunted mumble but the soft croon of a conspirator; remember him as the arsonist for hire in ""Body Heat"" forcing his employers to lean in close lest they miss his wicked meaning. That whisper of secrecy remained in Stanley White with his stiff gray hair his long coat and his vows of judicial vengeance. Stanley was the cop whom Rourke played in ""Year of the Dragon"" and everything about the project shouted overkill script by Oliver Stone direction by Michael Cimino and a racial attitude that was designed to rile. But there was Rourke holding steady at the core of the storm. And now the voice is back. In ""The Wrestler"" directed by Darren Aronofsky Rourke is Robin Ramzinski known to his admirers as Randy (the Ram) Robinson. The body is now a glistening mound of bruised and damaged goods and the quiff of Stanley White has been replaced by a mop of ropy blond extensions that you could wipe the floor with. Twenty years ago as the opening credits show Randy was a star on the wrestling circuit but the film follows him as he burns away. He lives in a trailer in New Jersey except that right now he doesnt; the landlord has locked him out for not paying the rent. Randy joshes with the local kids and plays Nintendo with one of them--""a really old game"" according to the boy who is used to Call of Duty. Such is modern senescence to age as quickly as a video game. Randy still wrestles but the cash is petty and he boosts his income by heaving boxes at a supermarket. He has a friend a stripper named Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) but she has no plans to be his girlfriend. Then there is Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood) his daughter although they havent met in years. When they do hook up things improve--too fast it turns out as if reconciliation were more of a dream than a practical goal. They book a dinner but Randy gets drunk misses the date and loses her once more. ""An old broken-down piece of meat"" he calls himself. ""Im alone and I deserve to be alone."" To some extent as that speech suggests ""The Wrestler"" is as simple as its title. The pathos of personal ruin is an established trope and the trick as demonstrated by John Huston in ""Fat City"" and by Martin Scorsese in ""Raging Bull"" is to stop it from sliding into the sentimental. Aronofsky doesnt always succeed in this and there are lines in Robert D. Siegels script that wave their symbolic purpose in the audiences face ""Its your heart--you need to start taking better care of it."" So says a hospital medic when Randy is admitted and undergoes bypass surgery after collapsing in the wake of a bout. Its O.K. Doc we get the point. But the movie like its hero manages to yank itself back into shape and that it strikes me is mostly due to Rourke. When Randy goes home after the operation and peels off his bandage the camera zooms in to inspect the scar on his chest whereas what really pinches our attention is his harmless habits the mild uncomplaining manner in which he pops in a hearing aid or adjusts his reading spectacles. He may be one of the last people in movies to use a pay phone. This fellow is mutton dressed as Ram and he knows it and if he earns the caress of our pity that is precisely because he never stoops to beg for it. There is no denying the brutality of ""The Wrestler"" and some of the scenes in the ring especially those which provoke the cardiac arrest are hard to watch. The movie comes off as inoffensive however since unusually for these times it trades in violence cleansed of ill will. The wrestlers are a club greeting one another as brothers in arms or in headlocks; one of them cheerfully sells Randy almost a thousand dollars worth of steroids and other drugs and in place of the hypocritical masking that bedevils major sports there is a peculiar honesty almost a decorum running beneath the overcooked beefcake and the staged aggression of the fights. ""What do you want to do tonight?"" one opponent asks Randy as if inviting him to the theatre before proposing that he enliven that evenings bout by puncturing his rival with a staple gun. You could call them cardboard characters pierced and flattened for the delight of the crowd but Aronofsky cast the minor roles with real wrestlers and you believe in every scourging of the flesh. For all that the best sequence in the film even more likely to lodge in your mind than the soaring sadness of the climax takes place not on the wrestlers canvas with its carpet of blood and broken glass but at the deli counter of the supermarket. Here Randy needing the money dons a protective hairnet and doles out pasta salad. He even pins on a name tag that says ""Robin"" randiness being too rich for this clientele. The dent to his pride is profound more wounding than any professional blow to the head and the scene closes in agony as he takes out his frustration on a meat slicer. But heres the thing while the job lasts hes pretty good at it bringing a brief shaft of pleasure to the customers and suffering any taunts that come his way. What Rourke offers us in short is not just a comeback performance but something much rarer a rounded raddled portrait of a good man. Suddenly there it is again--the charm the anxious modesty the never-distant hint of wrath the teen-age smiles and all the other virtues of a winner. No wonder people warmed to Randy Robinson twenty years ago. I felt the same about Mickey Rourke and I still do. For those who think of cinema as dramatic roughage ""The Reader"" should prove sufficiently indigestible. Directed by Stephen Daldry and adapted by David Hare from the novel by Bernhard Schlink it stars Kate Winslet as Hanna Schmitz a tram conductor in the German town of Neustadt. In 1958 she embarks on an affair with a fifteen-year-old schoolboy named Michael (David Kross). ""Look at me kid"" she says casually adopting the Humphrey Bogart position. They fall into the swing of a routine first he reads to her then they make love. In many ways the ideal existence. Time slouches on and in 1966 Michael now a law student sees Hanna again this time in a courtroom where she is being tried for her actions as an S.S. guard. He should be shocked by this revelation but Kross--who I regret to say is borderline bovine throughout--merely lowers his muzzle and pants a bit and Daldry himself seems to miss the moment as if he had spent too long chewing it over. The whole film in fact with its loping pace and plaintive score feels like a woefully polite not to say British take on a foreign horror; was there really no one from the fierce new wave of German filmmakers prepared to dramatize the Schlink? Or did they feel as I did that it was pernicious from the start--a low-grade musing on atrocity garnished with erotic titillation? Imprisoned for life Hanna must read to herself but are we really supposed to be moved by the thought--or now in Daldrys film by the sight--of an unrepentant Nazi parsing Chekhov? That is not culturally nourishing; it is morally famished. There is a fine scene near the end when a survivor of Hannas crimes (the great Lena Olin) tells the middle-aged Michael (Ralph Fiennes) that ""nothing came out of the camps"" that they ""werent therapy."" Quite true so why has the film pretended otherwise? Still ""The Reader"" is a triumph of bite and speed compared with ""Doubt."" This film written and directed by John Patrick Shanley who adapted it from his own play unfolds in 1964 at a Catholic school in the Bronx. A jovial priest Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is accused by the principal Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) of interfering with an altar boy. He denies it she yearns to believe it and we dont care. Collectors of large narrative signposts will spend a happy couple of hours at Shanleys movie enjoying the window-rattling thunderstorms that he uses to indicate spiritual crisis and the grimness with which Sister Aloysius narrowing her red-rimmed eyes delivers the line ""So its happened."" I didnt know you could hiss groan and murmur at the same time but Streep can do anything. She is of course wasted on this elephantine fable; if only ""Doubt"" had been made in 1964 shot by Roger Corman over a long weekend and retitled ""Spawn of the Devil Witch"" or ""Blood Wimple"" all would have been forgiven.

Langella about a mid-1970s confrontation between a wily British TV host and a ? disgraced American president. Doubt is a fictional drama starring Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman about a mid-1960s confrontation between an imperious Bronx nun in charge of a parochial school and a liberal priest she is convinced has behaved improperly with a student. The two might seem to have nothing in common save that both previously enjoyed award-laden Broadway runs and both are currently receiving Prestige Movie treatment. But the pair taken together constitute a rewarding study in the opportunities and pitfalls of adaptation. Frost/Nixon directed with practiced fluidity by Ron Howard surges with an energy and visual verve that improve the play and enhance the themes of dramatist Peter Morgans script -- about the codependency of media and politics and about the vanities of ambitious men shaping public images. Doubt fussily overdirected by its author John Patrick Shanley dulls the plays own sharp inquiries into the dangerous power of those who profess certainty with God on their side. Frost/Nixon trusts Sheen and Langella to re-create the roles they first originated to such acclaim in London in 2006 then moved to Broadway in 2007. Certainly the two stars know their characters inside and out Theres David Frost the striving TV-age smoothie who savored his jet-set lifestyle but craved journalistic legitimacy; and theres Richard M. Nixon the infinitely complicated politician forced to resign in the wake of Watergate who craved -- well obviously he craved something since he agreed (for a handsome fee) to sit with Frost through 12 days of taped interrogation. With the transcript as his guide Morgan explores psychological terrain how Frost found the chutzpah to land the interviews; how Nixon played cat and mouse with his interlocutor when asked to admit wrongdoing and apologize; how both men of humble beginnings felt stung by the scorn of those born with more ?privilege; and how both were superb manipulators. But Sheen (who played the very model of a modern British go-getter as Tony Blair in The Queen also written by Morgan) and Langella (operating at the peak of his powers) are disciplined enough to crop their performances to close-up size. (The sizing echoes the look of the ? actual interviews.) And Howard is smart ? to enhance the one-on-ones with journalistic context weaving archival Watergate-era ? footage into his fictionalized re-creation. Streep and Hoffman in contrast translate roles memorably created by Cherry Jones and Brian F. OByrne as Sister Aloysius and Father Flynn. Without a doubt the movie stars are primo ""gets"" in the famous-name sweepstakes. (Theyre aided by Viola ? Davis in a blazing brief appearance as the mother of the boy who may or may not have received the priests inappropriate attentions and by Amy Adams in the wan role of a susceptible younger nun who becomes the agent of Sister Aloysius terrible righteousness.) But Hoffman and Streep especially are also vulnerable actors in need of guidance from a director with a strong vision. And Shanley in his first movie-helming gig since he leaped into his own script for Joe Versus the Volcano nearly two decades ago and lost turns out to have dismayingly few original cinematic notions to back up the basic did-he-or-didnt-he hook in his study of conviction and compassion. Theres not a wind-whipped leaf rain-hammered window or burned-out lightbulb the director doesnt admire lest we ignore a metaphor about spiritual crisis. Meanwhile Streep apparently left to her own devices lugs a load of mannerisms under the pruny nuns severe black habit encouraged by the movies literal-minded director. Sister A may be an intimidating spirit-breaking character -- but for all that shes also ? a servant of God unswerving in her code of right and wrong and we ought to feel her burden. We dont. Speaking lines written to reach the stage heavens the cast is infernally noisy and hectoring about mysteries that ought ? to be felt with a communal hush. I doubt thats what the creator -- I mean the playwright -- had in mind.

Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) has decided with little evidence but her unyielding moral certitude that the charismatic Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) has been paying ""inappropriate"" attention to Donald Stewart the first black student at the St. Nicholas school in the Bronx. (The year is 1964 and the times they are a-changin.) Did he or didnt he? This question hangs over the battle royal that ensues as the stern Sister mounts a wily crusade to have Father Flynn thrown out of her school and Flynn fights to bring new ideas into the musty hallways of St. Nicholas.Shanley directing his own work throws in a few cinematic flourishes--hes big on tilted angles--but they only reinforce ""Doubts"" theatrical nature. Its a meaty showcase for its stars. Streep with her no-nonsense Bronx accent and know-it-all smirks gives this battleaxe a sly wit she may be working too hard but shes fun to watch. Hoffman makes a worthy sympathetic foe but its Viola Davis as Donalds mother who gets the most striking scene. Her reaction to Sister Aloysiuss suggestion that Father Flynn is taking advantage of her boy is not at all what the sister or we expect. ""Doubt"" stirs up a lot of stormy theatrical weather but the stolid transfer from stage to screen does Shanleys play no favors. It states its Big Themes eloquently but really does it have anything interesting to say about them?
