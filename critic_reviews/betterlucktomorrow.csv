Justin Lins movie embraces stereotypes in order to smash them. The heroes all Asian find the perfect cover in the way parents teachers and classmates perceive them _ intelligent and industrious yet quiet and humble. In reality theyre first-rate thieves and scam artists and they learn how to run their criminal enterprise by first mastering the socially acceptable art of scamming admissions deans at the nations top universities. Lin makes an argument worth considering that the soul-sucking college-application process and the shamelessly cynical resume-padding that goes into it are just a half-step away morally from a life of crime. These boys hearts are in nothing they do either academic or extracurricular; its all a show to impress a dean behind an ivy-covered wall. ""Better Luck Tomorrow"" _ shot in Orange County Calif. where Lin was raised _ is the most keenly observed savagely funny vision of high school life since 1999s ""Election."" Lins immersion into his characters universe is so deep that adults have only a handful of speaking roles _ a bold choice that suggests the extent to which parents and teachers can be kept in the dark. Any kid in this kind of pressure cooker needs a release and Ben (Parry Shen) who narrates this teen noir like a nerdy Fred MacMurray blows off steam after academic decathlon practice either by shooting free throws or shoplifting. His partners in the latter venture are goofy Virgil (Jason Tobin) and Virgils too-cool-for-school cousin Han (Sung Kang). The stakes are elevated when these three fall into the orbit of Daric (Roger Fan) a cocky good-looking poseur (""Dont let the letter jacket fool you. Its for tennis"" Ben says) whos the president of every school club that Ben and Virgil dutifully attend. Daric offers Ben 50 to prepare a cheat sheet and soon Daric Ben Virgil and Han are running a cheating racket and other elaborate scams. Eventually they begin dealing drugs. And after Daric pulls a gun during a fight at a party the four have an aura about them; they stride through the halls untouched. Yet Bens new notoriety cant help him win Stephanie (Karin Anna Cheung) the pouty-lipped cheerleader of his dreams. Stephanie likes Ben confides in him cries on his shoulder _ but shes dating callous two-timing private school student Steve (John Cho). Bens love for Stephanie and hatred of Steve drives the plot giving Ben an incentive to fall back into violent activities even after he distances himself from his pals. Shen like all the actors is perfect in the role; hes every doormat-geek you ever knew who pined for a girl he couldnt have. Lins pacing could be improved but his comic instincts are sharp. When Ben scraps his way onto the junior-varsity basketball team but rarely sees playing time Daric writes a bogus expose for the school newspaper about how Ben is the token Asian on the team. As a result Ben gets his own cheering section at games and hes known as ""The Yellow Shadow."" Ultimately Lins social observation is more potent than his storytelling _ the narrative loses steam in the second half even as it veers toward tragedy. Still ""Better Luck Tomorrow"" crackles with excitement and provokes pangs of recognition throughout. This is brave rancorous entertainment.

Week after week were beset by multimillion dollar marketing campaigns for studio productions that turn out to be nothing much or even less. Occasionally though a small independent feature heralded by the marketing equivalent of a hoarse whisper will provide the sort of offbeat pleasure that got us hooked on movies in the first place. Not one but two such films are going into wider distribution today ""Better Luck Tomorrow"" and ""Raising Victor Vargas."" Wider distribution is of course a relative thing. You will still have to seek these movies out because most multiplexes play it safe by playing only mainstream releases. But then independence always means demands as well as rewards. ""Better Luck Tomorrow"" (check playdates at www.betterlucktomorrow.com) breathes new life into a familiar story coming of age in high school. The setting is Southern Californias Orange County where Parry Shens Ben and several other Chinese-American students from affluent families get themselves into deepening trouble while pulling down impressive grades -- by hook or more often by crook. (In this superheated academic environment cheat sheets are a growth industry.) ""Our straight As were our alibis"" Ben reminisces semi-ruefully. This strong stylish debut feature which Justin Lin directed from a script he wrote with Ernesto M. Foronda and Fabian Marquez starts off like an ethnic variation of such classic youth anthems as ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" or ""Risky Business."" Then the cheerful comedy turns dark and violent and the amoral overachievers prove to be just as aimless and ominously detached as any impoverished kid from a dysfunctional family. Asian-American students have become poster children for overachievement so its tempting to focus on the films ethnic aspects. But the director and his colleagues have aimed for and achieved a universality that makes ""Better Luck Tomorrow"" all the more compelling. This is an American story -- about kids falling afoul of prosperity; making bad choices before they can comprehend the consequences; refusing to give the future a second glance and as Mr. Lin has said in interviews shopping for rather than searching for their identities. His own future couldnt be brighter; hes already being offered more movies than he could shoot in a lifetime. In this terrifically accomplished if somewhat erratic debut which was photographed by Patrice Lucien Cochet the cast includes Jason Tobin Sung Kang Roger Fan John Cho and Karin Anna Cheung who gives a lovely performance as the girl Ben yearns for passionately. And understandably. Raising Victor Vargas Peter Solletts ""Raising Victor Vargas"" (playdates at www.raisingvictorvargas.com) takes a different approach to adolescence. This enchanting romantic comedy is set on Manhattans Lower East Side. It tracks the growth of its title character who is played by an immensely likable young actor named Victor Rasuk from a charmingly callow self-styled stud into a tender young man whos capable of love and deserving of it too. While Victors world view has room for girls and little more Mr. Sollet sees his hero in the context of a truncated but vital family -- three siblings and their grandmother -- and a poor but vibrant neighborhood. I dont know how he managed to cover so much ground so gracefully but theres hardly a wasted moment in this debut feature or a false one. Victor wants desperately to woo the beautiful Judy whose nom de hood is Juicy Judy (a fine performance by Judy Marte) but his mating rituals with her are for the longest time all ritual and no mating. Victors grandma wants desperately to keep the family together but she considers his budding sexuality a dire threat so she tries to throw him out. (Shes played by Altagracia Guzman who is new to movie acting and incredibly good at it.) When Victor and Judy finally come together in a meeting of minds and bodies its because he has found the courage to drop his pretenses and she has found the wisdom to see him for the good ardent person he is. I loved this movie and I wish it could be seen by all those kids who turn out every weekend for shoddy studio comedies that show them who theyd like to be. ""Raising Victor Vargas"" shows young lovers as they are. A Mighty Wind In ""A Mighty Wind"" Christopher Guests sendup of folk music and the folkies who make it Eugene Levy plays a pop-eyed strangle-voiced scramble-brained survivor who is haunted by vague memories of his previous self. This exuberant mockumentary may be haunted by vivid memories of Mr. Guests previous films ""Waiting for Guffman"" and ""Best in Show."" It doesnt have the bite of the former which took on small-town life in America or the flagrant hilarity of the latter which ridiculed dog owners dog shows and dogs. Having said this and freely acknowledging a predisposition toward the subject -- I lived in Woodstock during its musical heyday -- I must also say that I laughed myself silly through most of ""A Mighty Wind"" and was pleasantly surprised when it took a turn toward genuine feeling near the end. (The end itself is a disappointment.) The framework of the film which was written by Messrs. Guest and Levy is a Town Hall concert to memorialize the passing of a folk-music entrepreneur Irving Steinbloom who bears a more-than-passing resemblance to the late Albert Grossman. Three groups from the 1960s regroup to play the gig the fatuous duo of Mitch amp; Mickey (Mr. Levy and Catherine OHara); The Folksmen (Mr. Guest Michael McKean and Harry Shearer the same trio that tore into rock n roll in the immortal ""This Is Spinal Tap"") and an all-singing all-smiling act called The New Main Street Singers (read New Christy Minstrels) that includes John Michael Higgins Jane Lynch and a pigtailed Parker Posey. Bob Balaban is Irving Steinblooms tone-deaf son and Fred Willard plays a manager with terrible taste. Hows that for inspired invention? Holes ""Holes"" a teen adventure based on the deservedly celebrated novel by Louis Sachar would seem to have everything going for it. Heres a film with serious issues for kids to consider even though its seriousness is folded into the loopy tale of a youngster whos wrongly accused of a minor crime and sent off to dig holes in a surreal Texas boot camp for troubled boys. The screen adaptation was done by Mr. Sachar himself and theres nothing but good to be said about the casting of the two central roles Shia LaBeouf as the palindromic hero Stanley Yelnats and Khleo Thomas as Zero Stanleys recessive resourceful friend. Still one would have to be totally tone-deaf not to notice that the director Andrew Davis has inflicted a broad cartoon style on adult performers who are distinctly uncomfortable with it; Sigourney Weaver as the warden Jon Voight as her henchman Mr. Sir and Patricia Arquette as the 19th-century bandit Kissin Kate. The book by contrast trusted young readers to grasp its subtleties. Stanleys real task though he doesnt know it until he succeeds at it is to free himself from a family curse that has served as an excuse for failure. (Zero too is playing out a destiny that he doesnt understand.) But the movie labors under the curse of the picturesque photography thats too clever by half; twanging guitars and a boop-booping tuba for constant comic emphasis; a landscape so endlessly dotted with holes as to undercut any grounding in reality and minor characters all atwitch with winks and nods. ""Holes"" comes with an assured audience -- great numbers of kids who loved the book and want to see just as with ""Harry Potter"" how it looks on the screen. Little will they know until after theyve seen it if then that it looked immeasurably better in their minds eye.  DVD TIP No one needs a cheat sheet in Cameron Crowes lovable romantic comedy ""Say Anything"" (1989). Ione Skyes Diane is a straight-A student and valedictorian of her high-school class. John Cusacks Lloyd Dobler doesnt have a clue what he wants to do with his life but hes mad for Diane and perfectly honest about who he is. I recommended this movie several years ago before it was available on DVD. The digital version provides an excuse if one is needed to see it again.

The underside of the Asian student high achievement syndrome is examined in ""Better Luck Tomorrow"" which uses crime film techniques to explore modern identity and cultural issues among some upper-middle-class kids. Deliberately designed to be provocative in its morally ambiguous stance toward the boys amoral and illegal activities Justin Lins nicely turned out picture is sometimes both predictable and a bit far-fetched narratively but still provides a generally absorbing look at a slice of society normally taken for granted both in life and onscreen. A modest theatrical career looks like a possibility for this cinematically promising effort. After a teaser opening in which two boys find a body buried in a suburban backyard yarn retreats four months to introduce Ben (Parry Shen) a 16-year-old student at an upscale Southern California high school who fits the stereotype of the dedicated Asian scholar to perfection Presentable but nerdily unassuming Ben single-mindedly pursues his goal of being the ideal college applicant by studying even more than necessary doing the requisite community work holding down a job and avoiding the distracting dating and party scene. His only wayward eccentricity is an occasional bit of shoplifting with his goofy friend Virgil (Jason Tobin). Ben is on the basketball team but its a career curtailed when another Asian student ultra-cool class leader Daric (Roger Fan) writes a school newspaper article pointing out that the perennially benched Ben reps a blatant token fulfillment of affirmative action requirements for the team. Distressed by the unwelcome spotlight Ben quits but is eventually persuaded by the smooth-talking Daric to make some easy money prepping cheat sheets for school exams. This low-end malfeasance soon grows into more grandiose criminal activities involving Virgil; the latters streetwise older cousin Han (Sung Kang) whose studied silence and slumped posture marks him as a lifelong fan of Hong Kong crime films; and Steve (John Cho) a rich boy from a rival school who is the boyfriend of Stephanie (Karin Anna Cheung) the cute ultra-achiever Ben has always fancied. Darics little gang soon rules the school (they rep it at an Academic Decathlon held of all places in Vegas where Daric arranges for Ben to lose his virginity with a hooker) and on the streets where Steve ushers the way into the world of drugs and stolen merchandise. In the usual downward spiral drink and drugs easily conquer straight-and-narrow impulses and Ben sees his shining future dimming before his eyes. When Ben opts to bow out Daric surprisingly agrees to disband the crew but not before turning the tables on the arrogant Steve who has offended Ben with his mistreatment of Stephanie. Naturally this final job has unintended tragic consequences and the way the surviving young men react to the event has a lot to say about their view of the relative priorities of morality justice self-preservation and entitlement. Its not a pretty picture although one drawn in terms that seem equally drawn from movies as from real life; the idea that the guys could get away with as much as they do without it being noticed by anyone is a stretch as is the blind eye the ultra-correct Stephanie turns toward Steves behavior. Lin and his co-screenwriters Ernesto M. Foronda and Fabian Marquez unfold these events with speed economy and no small number of credible sociological details; the kids live in uniform squeaky clean modern houses in a characterless community where parents and school overseers are never seen. They are expected to perform well and do so and one can hardly say that this soil no matter how shallow is a normal breeding ground for violent feelings deeper than a certain ennui and anxiety. The problem with these over-privileged souls is that they imagine they can behave however they want and still get what they believe is their due that they think they can get away with anything. Maybe they can which is dilemma Lin presents to the audience. Pic has stylistic smarts is energized by a sharp song score and is boosted by a very good cast notably the charismatic Fan as the risk-taking Daric Shen as the good boy too weak not to go bad and Cheung as the preppy 4.0 dream girl.

"Lins School Daze washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Lins School Daze Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 18 2003 THERES a swirling disturbing undertow to the American Dream in ""Better Luck Tomorrow."" Its the arrogant expectations of a group of high schoolers from Californias Orange County who want success all too immediately and easily. Justin Lins debut film is an intriguingly grim spin on the usually hyper-romanticized immigrant story. But Lin swings the pendulum too far toward jaded nihilism. Although this movie shows Lins promising moviemaking sensibilities its point of view feels coldly amoral and dismissive. Theres something tacitly celebratory between the lines as though a cult movie is being gleefully assembled. (Come see the Asian American ""Clockwork Orange"") As for his appointed hero the charming conscientious student Ben (Parry Shen) he feels like Lins pawn in a somewhat cynical scheme. Hes a high school senior great at academics but useless with girls obsessed with making it through the dolphin hoops of the college application process. He does all the appropriate activities lunch-hour social clubs rote memorization of impressive power words for his vocabulary and so forth. Clearly Lin wants to show him trying to do things the right way so well practically cheer when he opts for the less legitimate approach. The road to ruin lies with his ambitious hyped-up friends Virgil (Jason Tobin) Han (Sung Kang) and Daric (Roger Fan) who dont let morals get in the way of their almost vampirical drive for good times. They steal they participate in academic fraud they deal drugs. Its all good. Its all fun. Bens high-road/low-road quandary is compounded by his dangerous attraction to Stephanie (Karin Anna Cheung) a cheerleader whos seeing Steve (John Cho) the ultimate hipster. He doesnt go to their school. He drives a motorbike. He thinks purely about himself. Lins story (which starts with the discovery of a dead body and goes back to how it all began) is an episodic sprawl rather than a straightforward scenario. Were faced with some disconcerting questions Are we to laud hyper-intelligent kids for taking shortcuts to a better life to the point of academic cheating and even murder? Are we even to accept their actions (with hand-wringing resignation) as the unavoidable consequences of a societys unfair pressures on its best and brightest? Lin seems morally satisfied with this angle. Bad things happen. This is America. Why not use it to an advantage? In the end the narrative meandering becomes the movies finest asset. We get time to really know Ben and his friends as they cool heels josh with and eventually bitterly fight with one another. Shens nicely textured performance brings much-needed warmth and likability to these moments. And theres something deeply refreshing about experiencing Asian American characters who are largely free of the usual movie stereotypes. But theres a corollary to this Theyre perfectly but disturbingly American. BETTER LUCK TOMORROW (R 98 minutes) -- Contains violence drug use nudity obscenity and sexual situations.

Though it focuses on disaffected suburban high-schoolers Better Luck Tomorrow is no Breakfast Club. Theres a lot more than talk going on and the times become very fast indeed for the seniors in this well-crafted Tarantino-esque story. First-time director Justin Lin has co-written and directed this compelling story about four overachieving Asian-American high school students. Bored by their suburban existences and stressed over the quest for the perfect blend of superlative SAT scores top grades and extracurricular activities that will get them into the best colleges the young men (newcomers Parry Shen Jason J. Tobin Roger Fan and Sung Kang) turn their sights to petty crime. At first it seems the goal is just to outsmart the powers that be but the crimes snowball. All of the key players are blessedly non-stereotypical. There is an inspired cameo a biology teacher played by Jerry Mathers (yes The Beaver who is instantly recognizable even in middle age). These guys are the (smarter) descendants of that suburban mischief-maker. The young men and the slightly older Steve (John Cho) are wonderful natural actors. Ben (Shen) the conscience of the group is a standout. There is a moral ambiguity to the film that could disturb some viewers but the films clever plotting and intriguing characters will stay with you well after leaving the theater. (In select cities; R violence drug use language and sexuality.) -- Claudia Puig XX/XY Coles and Sam while young and impetuous college students fall for each other and experiment with a menage a trois with Thea. All go their separate ways but a chance encounter 10 years later reignites sparks between Coles and Sam. XX/XY explores love lust and honesty in relationships as well as the maturation that happens after college. Even though the film has two distinct stories -- the college affair and the participants lives a decade after -- the movie is nonlinear and makes effective use of lighting to delineate the stories. Reviews of the movies Better Luck Tomorrow XX/XY The Good Thief In the 10-years-later story line Coles (Mark Ruffalo) a failed filmmaker now making commercials about dancing tacos is living with his girlfriend of five years who warms up to his old friends. Thea (Kathleen Robertson) is happily married to a successful restaurateur. Like the others she was once boho but now tools around in a Range Rover. Sam (Maya Stange) has been living in London and is engaged to a Brit. Theres a funny scene in which Coles is recognized by a passer-by who tells him he didnt like his movie and wants his money back. Unfortunately many of the other scenes drag. Its not always easy to watch pretentious college types pose and preen but Ruffalos charm saves the film from tedium. Some moments in XX/XY ring true and the honesty exposed is revelatory. But like some relationships this drama can be tough to endure. (In New York and Los Angeles R for sexuality language and drug use.) -- C.P. The Good Thief The caper-pic rule book all but mandates that someone try to pluck booty languishing in some European vault. But by now this overworked genre needs a fresh angle or two to attract moviegoers begging for something grown-up in theaters. For them The Good Thief offers a couple of good benefits. One is the pleasing sight of Nick Nolte in fairly robust form. The other is the chance to see an erratic but talented filmmaker (The Crying Games Neil Jordan) taking a reasonably successful crack at remaking a French film classic. This would be director Jean-Pierre Melvilles Bob Le Flambeur from 1955. Noltes version of Bob looks like a Grecian Formula kinda guy who has been around both in life and on the French Riviera. Hes a junkie who nonetheless knows casino protocol and is still attractive enough to maintain at least the passing interest of a much younger Eastern European immigrant (Nutsa Kukhianidze). She waitresses in a not-so-nice Nice eatery where we see Bob shooting up and she later helps handcuff him to a bed when he goes cold turkey. This is necessary because an opportunity has presented itself a decoy casino robbery to camouflage a much bigger robbery of art. To come up with the stake money Bob unloads his own Picasso to a malevolent fence played by Ralph Fiennes in a juicy cameo. This is a movie more interesting for its atmosphere and characters especially twin brothers who set up some nifty plotting. For a movie that earns its R rating for drug content and violence atop language and sexuality it leaves you with the next thing to a mellow smile. (Expands to major markets) --Mike Clark Ghosts of the Abyss (not reviewed) Titanic director James Cameron takes viewers on a 3-D IMAX journey back to the ruins of the legendary shipwreck that killed nearly 1500 people.

Nevius Published 400 am Friday April 11 2003 Better Luck Tomorrow Coming-of-age drama. Starring Parry Shen Jason Tobin Roger Fan and John Cho. Directed by Justin Lin. Co-written by Justin Lin Ernesto Foronda and Fabian Marquez. (R. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Justin Lin made ""Better Luck Tomorrow"" with a film thesis from UCLA and a fistful of credit cards. He wont have to do that again. After this effortless tour de force hell have all the money he needs for his next project. Although ""BLT"" as it is known to the faithful is being given a limited release this weekend (New York San Francisco Los Angeles Chicago) because of fears that a movie about Asian teens wouldnt play in Middle America this could be a surprise breakout hit. Lin never gets on a soapbox and these characters could have walked out of any high school in the country. Lin begins with a fresh idea. He takes the cliche of Asian overachievers and adds an edge. These clean-cut high schoolers work the system like an ATM. Straight As are just the start of it. They organize beach cleanups run the fund-raising car wash and have not only already sent in their early admission forms to the best colleges but even been accepted. The twist is that now that theyve got school wired they are looking for another challenge. Ripping off the local computer store is just another after- school project. Its too easy. Theyre too smart for everyone else too clever to get caught and no one suspects a thing. Thats the problem. With no one to stop them -- parents are nonexistent in the movie -- they get in way over their heads. ""Basically"" says Ben Manibang the central character ""it was the suburbs. We had nothing else to do. As long as our grades were there we were trusted."" The real story is the struggle for Bens soul. Parry Shen who plays Ben has the fresh-faced all-American look of a kid from a Gap commercial. Hes a total grind of course doing all his homework and his lab partners too. In his spare time he shoots exactly 215 free throws a day and records the results in his journal. The first hint that something is lurking beneath the surface is when Daric (Roger Fan) interviews Ben for the school paper about playing on the basketball team. Daric is every mothers dream date for her daughter. Tall handsome and studious he strolls through the halls in his letter jacket (""Just tennis"" Ben tells us. ""Not a real sport."") as if he owns the place. But Daric wants to grill Ben about how he feels about being a ""token Asian"" on the team. Ben wants nothing to do with the idea and suggests that Daric talk to the coach. When the story comes out -- claiming that Bens only role on the team is to sit on the bench and represent diversity -- it kicks off a minor furor with sign-waving kids at the games chanting ""Put Ben in"" What happened to the quotes from the coach Ben asks about the story. ""He didnt say what I wanted"" Daric says ""so I left them out."" So maybe things in the burbs arent quite as virtuous and squeaky-clean as they seem. Ben and his friends may be nailing all the tests and winning the Academic Olympics but they still resent being treated like outsiders. ""What is this Asian night out?"" asks one of the burly football jocks at a party. ""Yeah"" says Ben playing along ""the library was closed."" But dont you think a part of them would like to stick a gun at that fat jerks head wipe that smirk off his face and leave him whimpering on the ground like a little girl? You bet they would. To Lins credit the gradual descent into lawlessness has a logical inevitable feel. Even when they fall into some bad bad things they seem like such nice kids you cant believe it wont all turn out just fine. Thats why you wont see the climactic moment coming. In some ways this is ""The Graduate"" gone to ""Lord of the Flies."" Dustin Hoffmans character was named Ben too and he was just as conflicted about his future as Ben Manibang. But although each character drives off with the unattainable girl at the end of the movie when it happens in ""BLT"" it gives you a final little chill.

Cowriter-director Justin Lin has captured something new the tenor and style of an Asian-American youth culture that sees no contradiction between punk aggression and brainiac fervor. The hero Ben (Parry Shen) pushes himself to a place that isnt ultimately plausible yet Lin works with rhythmic observational flair. At times the film feels like a John Hughes triangle with edgier DNA. Still its a long way from Long Duk Dong.
