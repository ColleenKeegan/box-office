"1408 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; 1408 ) 1408 (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli If elements of 1408 seem a little familiar it shouldnt be a surprise. Heres John Cusack once again having lodging problems (see also Identity). Heres a supernatural debunker faced with something that refuses to be debunked (see also The Reaping). And heres a movie about a room-for-rent where people go in but dont come out (see also Vacancy). Yet despite all of these recycled plot elements bobbing around theres nothing stale about 1408 which is easily the best horror film of 2007. Too often we see a movie with a great setup like this ruined by a subpar ending. However 1408 deftly sidesteps that trap delivering a conclusion that somehow manages not to disappoint while at the same time leaving things open-ended enough that viewer interpretation comes into play. To say that movie adaptations of Stephen King stories have a checkered history is to understate the matter. The rule of thumb is that Kings non-horror efforts have gotten much better treatment than his bread-and-butter fare. The rule doesnt apply here though. While 1408 isnt on the same plane as The Shawshank Redemption or Misery its easily among the best King-inspired motion pictures to-date. It is by turns bold scary and downright creepy. The film doesnt try to do too much and what appears to be a dead give-away of things to come turns out to be nothing more than a delicious piece of misdirection. I love that sort of thing. Instead of the viewer being a step ahead of the filmmakers its the other way around. Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is a professional skeptic. He makes his living by visiting supposed haunted houses and writing about the absence of ghosts. For him room 1408 at New Yorks Dolphin Hotel is too good a challenge to pass up. In its nearly 100 years of existence 56 people have died in that room. The hotels manager (Samuel L. Jackson) calls it ""fucking evil"" and advises in the strongest terms that Mike not stay there. ""No one"" he advises ""has lasted more than an hour."" At first Mike is nonplused by the ordinariness of the accommodations. Then strange things begin happening and by the time he decides that checking out early might be the wisest decision that option no longer exists. For the most part this is John Cusacks movie to carry and he has no problem taking it where it needs to go. His ""co-stars"" Jackson and Mary McCormack (as Mikes estranged wife Lily) have minimal screen time. Most of the movie focuses on Cusack alone in his room trapped in an escalating environment of paranoia. Cusack uses his sunny good natured disposition to get the audience to like him and once thats accomplished the film has us. Director Mikael HAY=fstrAPm is as adept at setting up ""boo"" moments as he is at building and sustaining suspense. From the moment Mike enters the room theres a growing sense of dread but this is punctuated by instances of stark sudden terror. This is HAY=fstrAPms second English language motion picture and its a considerable step up from his previous effort the unsatisfactory Clive Owen/Jennifer Aniston thriller Derailed. 1408 is divided into three clearly delineated acts. The first which lasts about 30 minutes is the setup. We meet Mike on the outside get to know him a little then follow his single-minded determination to remove all obstacles and get his story. The second act takes place with Mike alone in the room. This is the most eerie unsettling portion of the movie and will forever change your opinion of a sentimental Carpenters wedding classic. The third act is the shortest but offers enough twists and switchbacks to turn what initially seems to be a conventional denouement into anything but that. You can see it cominga| or can you? While the final scene wont frustrate anyone the way the ending of The Sopranos did its not clear-cut either. Theres room for interpretation which is a rarity in any horror film. 1408 doesnt belong grouped with the likes of Hostel and Saw because the filmmakers understand that fear gestates in the mind. Gore can as often diminish terror as enhance it. 1408 can be rated PG-13 and still frighten the crap out of viewers because of the way the director balances claustrophobia with suspense. Yet things never become too intense which can be a danger with a movie like this. Thats where John Cusack shines through. Even in the midst of a personal apocalypse he can utter a one-liner to break the tension. The PG-13 rating might argue that 1408 is for teenagers but thats a mistake. This is the most mature horror movie of the year - far more adult and sophisticated than the tedious Hostel Part II. If you like to be creeped out by movies this is one to see. It reminds us what its like to be scared in a theater rather than overwhelmed by buckets of blood and gore. 1408 (United States 2007) Director Mikael HAY=fstrAPm Cast John Cusack Mary McCormack Samuel L.

By Scott Bowles USA TODAY Terror for Stephen King must be wondering what will happen to his stories once they make it to the big screen; he once vowed never to direct again for fear it would come out looking like Maximum Overdrive. But he has no need to worry this time around in 1408 a faithful and creepy adaptation of his 2002 short story. At his best Kings most effective creatures are not the ones behind creaking doors but inside crooked minds. And director Mikael Hafstrom (Derailed) takes the principle to heart in this story about Mike Enslin a hack author (John Cusack) who doesnt believe in ghosts but makes a healthy living rating haunted hotels. Enslin changes his tune when he checks into room 1408 of Manhattans Dolphin Hotel. Enslin learns from the dapper but cryptic hotel manager (Samuel Jackson) that 56 people have died after checking into that very suite. Somehow business is still brisk; perhaps the health inspector was off those days. Enslin is unmoved though and checks in determined to prove the ghosts are a hoax. 1408 employs some of the standard haunted-house conventions Floors groan apparitions appear in windows the electricity is shot. Oh and the walls bleed. King must have had a nasty wallpapering experience as a younger man. What elevates the film are its two primary characters Cusack and the room. Much of 1408 is the actor alone in the suite a role that could have drawn a perfunctory dubious-to-terrified turn. But Cusacks performance slowly reveals a man trying to exorcise his own demons by debunking others. And while it isnt The Shinings Overlook Hotel Room 1408 has some sinister amenities that might have pleased Stanley Kubrick particularly a scene in which the suite freezes over into a blue-hued icebox. The rooms are small enough to feel claustrophobic and appointed with the kind of clawfoot tubs and antiques that would have most guests demanding an upgrade. Even the clock radio is creepy. You wont listen to The Carpenters Weve Only Just Begun the same way again. 1408 loses a few chills when Hafstrom goes effects-happy near the end. But it shouldnt be enough to scare away audiences looking for something other than the assembly-line slice-and-dice horror films of late. Just stay away from the room service.

"1408 Hoary movie | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMovies1408 Hoary movieThe key I think to Stephen Kings prolific genius is that he can craft a complex and compelling story out of the simplest most basic concepts and characters the overzealous fan the malevolent car/dog/clown/whatever the prom night gone horribly wrong - stuff you could scribble out on a paper napkin and still leave room for a good-sized ketchup stain.By Rob SalemTelevision CriticFri. June 22 2007 Starring John Cusack Samuel L. Jackson and Mary McCormack. Based on a short story by Stephen King. Directed by Mikael Hafstrom. 94 minutes. At major theatres. 14A  Article Continued BelowThe key I think to Stephen Kings prolific genius is that he can craft a complex and compelling story out of the simplest most basic concepts and characters the overzealous fan the malevolent car/dog/clown/whatever the prom night gone horribly wrong - stuff you could scribble out on a paper napkin and still leave room for a good-sized ketchup stain.There is no hoarier horror cliche than the old-fashioned haunted house/hotel room. Even King initially dismissed this particular notion as a simple writing exercise to which he later returned to flesh out into a full-on King short story now the basis of yet another King-inspired movie 1408.Not the most original idea in any lesser writers hands - as we have lately had ample evidence particularly at the movies. But King somehow finds the human equation that transcends the usual ""knock knock boos there.""And by ""lesser writer"" I mean someone very much like 1408s protagonist Mike Enslin (a somewhat slumming John Cusack) a once-promising young novelist touched by tragedy and now reduced to grinding out cheesy travel guides debunking ""haunted"" inns hotels and tourist attractions.Enslin is not a believer - in much of anything anymore. He is certainly skeptical when he first hears about New Yorks venerable Dolphin Hotel and its haunted room No. 1408.Which is actually of course on the 13th floor since the building doesnt officially have a 13th. And the numbers themselves add up to 13. Ooooh scary.Then along comes Samuel L. Jackson as the hotel manager with the really scary number 56 - as in the number of people who have died in the room in the hotels long and colourful history. No one he archly insists who has ever checked in has ever lasted more than an hour.Right away I am as skeptical as Enslin. You would think that afterthe first couple dozen horrible deaths the hotel management of the time would have pretty much boarded the room up for good. Or at the very least re-decorated.But no they kept right on checking folks in - charging a full days rate for merely one hours use.Even now Jacksons manager while initially insisting he does not want the publicity and thus would not rent Enslin the room eventually relents (as he is supposedly legally obligated to do.)Enslin almost immediately regrets his insistance. I wont spoil the few actual thrills and chills that await him (and you) behind that door though several of them are quite inventively lensed by Swedish director Mikael Hafstrom (Derailed) in his second American feature. Suffice it to say you will never be able to listen to The Carpenters ""Weve Only Just Begun"" quite the same way again.The film ends on a much more upbeat and hopeful note than the original King short story - but then it would have to. If only to remind us that King film adaptations are historically hit and miss. Even as haunted hotel King movies go 1408 is certainly no Shining. Not even the TV-movie version.

At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and to purchase tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) ""1408"" is one of the good Stephen King adaptations one that maintains its authors sly sense of humor and satiric view of human nature. It puts in motion an irresistibly watchable situation -- and then delivers by giving us more than just the clever setup. Remembering that horror movies are essentially stories of the spirit the filmmakers provide enough rough gothic poetry to answer the yearnings behind horror -- the audiences desire for a world beyond this one. The care that went into ""1408"" is especially appreciated as a perfectly acceptable horror movie could have been made on the basis of its premise alone Theres an evil room -- 1408 -- in a New York hotel. No one lasts more than an hour. Fifty-six people have ended up dead some of suicide the rest of supposedly natural causes. One woman went insane and blinded herself after 10 minutes. ... Yet Mike Enslin a popular true-horror writer and debunker checks in for the night anyway. He doesnt believe in the occult. He thinks its all a big joke. Sold yet? But wait there are embellishments. John Cusack an enormously engaging actor plays Enslin who starts the film as an unhappy abrupt man who believes in nothing and has a touch of the smart-aleck about him. Within minutes the audience really wants to see that guy in the room. But that pleasure is delayed and further intensified by a long intervening scene in which the hotel manager tries and tries to talk him out of it. The manager is played by Samuel L. Jackson which should be enough to give him pause This room is bad enough to scare Samuel L. Jackson. But does he listen? Do we want him to listen? The overkill of the buildup is both effective and faintly (and intentionally) ridiculous culminating in a shot from inside a long dark cylindrical safe as Jackson reaches in his hand to retrieve the key. This is the old stuff the good stuff the tried-and-true stuff of shrewdly accomplished audience manipulation. Laugh at the obviousness of it all -- I did -- and yet include yourself in the joke because theres no walking away from this one. Once Cusack has that key in his hand the audience is in for the duration. Though ""1408"" is a more genuinely scary movie than most horror films it maintains a certain geniality with regard to its audience. Director Mikael Hafstrom (""Derailed"") never resorts to the cheap device of trying to shock us with disgusting visuals -- or scare us by threatening to disgust us. From start to finish it remains a pleasure to watch our hero get tortured and the movies frights are well-earned ""1408"" gets underneath the viewers skin in a psychological way. In a sense the triumph of the film is that having grabbed the audience through its sure-fire cleverness it engages and holds attention through its complexity. The room is a room of tangible horror. But its also a chamber of hallucination a space outside time and a place where the unconscious is unleashed. At times it seems like a metaphor for a bad LSD trip. The story does well in providing the protagonist with a painful past and with a longing for the other side thats at least as intense as the audiences. So go for the gimmick but stay for the ideas and the emotion. At the same time ""1408"" doesnt try to insult anyones intelligence by pretending to be deeper than it is. Why is the room doing this? What is the room? Why is it so evil? Theres no satisfactory answer. So the screenwriters answer the question by dismissing it with a classic use of the MPAAs one free f-word policy for PG-13 pictures. Theres nothing more to say except that Jackson gets the line and he delivers it well. -- Advisory Psychological unease threats of violence frightening scenes and Samuel L. Jackson dropping the f-bomb.

In 1408 a Stephen King spookfest set in a seriously poltergeisted hotel the clock radio keeps clicking on the same old song. Its the Carpenters ""Weve Only Just Begun"" over and over and over. Even when travel writer Mike Enslin (John Cusack) yanks the cord from the wall the tune keeps playing. Its enough to make you scream. An entertainingly hairy paranormal affair based on a King short story and directed by Swede-gone-Hollywood Mikael HAY=fstrAPm (the Jennifer Aniston/Clive Owen thriller Derailed) sets up its star - and its audience - for a blood-curdling bone-chilling night of horror. After a while the horror turns to hooey. But as fright flick aficionados know too well its hard to sustain this stuff and HAY=fstrAPm and Cusack give it a good run. The premise is simple Enslin a once-promising novelist scarred by personal tragedy checks into New Yorks Dolphin Hotel. He writes guidebooks about putatively haunted hospitality spots and legend has it that the Dolphins room 1408 is ghost-plagued. Guests have been maimed gone insane jumped from the windows and drowned in the tub. In fact no one has survived unscathed for more than an hour within its tastefully decorated walls. Room 1408s death toll 50 at least. Its gotten so bad that the hotels manager Gerald Olin (a dapper distinguished Samuel L. Jackson) has barred anyone from staying there. But Enslin and his publisher insist on that room and threaten to take the hotel to court if he cant stay there. Let the terrors begin. Borrowing (or cannibalizing in Kings case) bits of The Shining and assorted spooky motel/hotel yarns 1408 begins in cheerfully macabre fashion. After a tete-a-tete with the Dolphin manager Enslin a professional cynic retires to his suite for a grand night of drinking and debunking. A few initial jolts are shrugged off as laughable mishaps but then certifiably weird stuff begins to happen scalding plumbing crashing windows a creepy doppelganger in a building across the way. And then theres that radio and Karen Carpenters merrily sinister warble. In truth as Cusacks character is subjected to more and more supernatural malevolence 1408 becomes less and less interesting. The hotel room in Barton Fink the Coen Brothers 1991 Kafkaesque Hollywood fable managed to produce a potent sense of dread with just a few cutaways to peeling perspiring wallpaper. Still 1408 is diverting. Cusack in a veritable one-man-show gets to play mournful funny reckless cocky contrite and scared out of his wits. The effects are well-orchestrated and the sly humor oozes out like toothpaste from a tube. Compliments of the front desk. 1408  (out of four stars) Directed by Mikael HAY=fstrAPm written by Matt Greenberg Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski based on a short story by Stephen King photography by Benoit Delhomme distributed by The Weinstein Co.

BY Elizabeth Weitzmandaily News Writer Friday June 22 2007 400 AM 1408 Thriller about a writer who gets stuck in a haunted hotel room. With John Cusack Samuel L. Jackson. Director Mikael Hafstrom (134). PG-13 Violence disturbing images language. At area theaters. Remember how great John Cusack movies used to be? From ""Better Off Dead"" to ""Being John Malkovich"" Cusack once chose projects that perfectly balanced his wry sense of humor and everyman appeal. But after ""High Fidelity"" he fell into a funk he cant seem to crawl out of. After seeing his disappointing new horror flick ""1408"" youll wonder if hes being haunted by career curse. A curse incidentally would be a great improvement on the wishy-washy wickedness of this movie which is based on Stephen Kings (much creepier) story of the same name. Cusacks Mike is a writer who specializes in debunking paranormal claims. His latest target is Manhattans Dolphin Hotel which is apparently harboring some nasty mojo in room 1408. Dismissing ominous warnings from the manager (Samuel L. Jackson) Mike enters the room looks around and wonders ""This is it?"" Actually thats what youll think too once the room lets loose its full arsenal. First it gets really hot then it gets really cold. Spirits wander around before jumping out the window. The clock radio goes crazy. Scared yet? Meanwhile director Mikael Hafstrom cant even decide what kind of movie hes making. At its best we get a straight-up poltergeist picture in which as Jackson declares 1408 is simply ""an evil f- room."" But then Hafstrom starts hinting the terror is all in Mikes mind. Is he the victim of a spiked drink? In a coma? Insane with grief over his daughters recent death or his estrangement from his wife (Mary McCormack)? Problem is unless you have the writing skills of a Stephen King theres no suspense if theres no real danger. So the script gets increasingly desperate trotting out red herrings and cheap tricks like the ghost of Mikes daughter (Jasmine Anthony) who whimpers at her horrified daddy ""Dont you love me anymore?"" Cusack fights hard to entertain us and his strongest scenes hint at how much fun we could have had. But in this mix of recycled scares and half-hearted twists the only real fright is the sight of an interesting actor wasting his talents in yet another mediocre movie. elyzawaol.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Its the attitude that ghost debunker and writer Mike Enslin (John Cusack) takes to every haunted hotel room he visits. After all other than second-rate paintings of fruit and sailboats what distinguishes one hotel room from another? Enslin receives a postcard from the hotels ""staff"" inviting him to explore what sets room 1408 in New Yorks fictional Dolphin Hotel apart from any of the other ghost-infested inns. After Enslin has finagled his way into the room manager Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson) begs him not to stay sweetening the deal with offers of free upgrades to a penthouse suite an 800 bottle of champagne and unrestricted access to the hotels files of every one of the 56 deaths that happened in the room. ""I dont want you checking into room 1408 because I dont want to clean up the mess"" Olin says. Although the movie ""1408"" directed by Mikael Hafstrom and based on a Stephen King short story follows a cliched theme in its opening minutes it eventually distinguishes itself from slash-your- own-throat horror movies by illustrating how hotels can be creepy places. The movie forces us to confront the supernatural while weighing it against everything we might find unsettling about staying in a strange room. Enslin cant say he wasnt warned. The manager tells him about one former occupant who slit his throat and bled to death while trying to stitch it back together. The argument is lost on Enslin. In fact it merely whets his desire to stay in the room. Because it just so happens that Enslin doesnt believe in ghosts. The jaded writer whose heartache is brought to life through the droopy-eyed Cusack stopped believing in heaven hell and everything supernatural after his terminally ill daughter died. Enslin soon realizes he is not alone when things start running amok with time-honored paranormal activities A radio blasts the Carpenters ""Weve Only Just Begun"" and windows slam on Enslins hands as he takes in the view. Old home videos of his wife and their daughter start playing on the television. Oh and the digital clock on the nightstand resets itself to a 60-minute countdown for his life. At this point Enslin realizes he is dealing with more than he can handle and launches a desperate attempt to escape. Hello front desk Ill be checking out early With some horror films digital effects can be hit or miss. But ""1408"" nails them with its portrayal of a melting telephone and the f0rmer occupants re-enacting their last few moments before death subtly combusting before hitting the ground. Only the overly digitized scenes with a masked swordsman and a creepy-crawly being in a vent fall short. The movie chronicles Enslins battle with mind over matter and reality over make-believe. The result a psychologically thrilling movie that leaves you gasping in the end. Staff writer Desiree Belmarez can be reached at 303-954-1211 or at dbelmarezdenverpost.com.

"As thrillers go 1408 leaves too much room for fun - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Events    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW As thrillers go 1408 leaves too much room for fun By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  June 22 2007 Has John Cusack ever been more adorably out of his mind than when hes going bonkers on a minibar in ""1408""? His aggravation is understandable. A little Samuel L. Jackson is somewhere inside. (It brings me great joy thinking theres a little Samuel L. Jackson inside anything. He brings mediocre things to life.) But for an explanation of why Jackson is there or why Cusack thinks he is anyway youll have to see this moderately spooky thriller for yourself -- and afterward  feel free to report your findings. Thats the kind of thriller ""1408"" is If you feel like solving a puzzle it might be fun. Otherwise its a lot of consonants and no vowels.Still the movie is another opportunity for Cusack to shield emotional vulnerability in a cynics armor. Taken from a Stephen King short story ""1408"" has the actor playing Michael Enslin  a talented novelist turned myth-busting hack who cranks out survival guides to haunted locations. His latest project is a mysterious room in a grand Manhattan hotel where over the years 56 people have died many of natural causes. This is according to the peeved manager whom Jackson plays with a two-tone goatee. He smoothly insists Michael find a different room but Michael refuses. So its off to 1408  where the bathroom faucet gushes scalding water the window conspires to crush his hand and the clock radio plays the Carpenterss ""Weve Only Just Begun"" whenever it pleases. Eventually the room ropes Michaels wife (Mary McCormack ) and his dead daughter (Jasmine Jessica Anthony ) into the mayhem.These are but a few of the tricks designed to kill Michael or drive him crazy. Jackson tells us the room is evil and the production team comes up with a set that does seem elastically spiteful. Room 1408 is glacial one minute deluged the next a post-apocalyptic ruin later on.Directed by Mikael Hafstrom  whose previous movie was the ludicrous Clive Owen- Jennifer Aniston noir ""Derailed "" ""1408"" is a movie very much predicated on the delicate balance between perception and reality. Is Michael trapped in a kind of guilty purgatory? The hotel floor plan is in the shape of a big black ""H"" meaning hes trapped somewhere else (""You are here"" says the map). The script is credited to Matt Greenberg and the team of Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski (""Ed Wood"" ""Man on the Moon"") and it has a sense of humor generous enough to keep Cusack in on the joke. The soothing cadences of the hotel operator are a hilarious insult to Michaels erupting panic.""1408"" is actually a more respectable more entertaining star-driven head-game than Sandra Bullocks ""Premonition "" or Jim Carreys ""The Number 23 ."" Cusack is very much at home in the movies blend of comedy and fright. Make that would-be fright. The problem with this movie is that it feels too much like a joke rather than a true work of suspense. After ""The Sopranos "" series finale no ending can seem too abrupt and yet this one is a shrug. Hafstrom conjures a wonderful anticipatory mood of dread in the first 30 minutes then he blows it to stylish smithereens.Maybe I was thinking fondly of Stanley Kubricks ""The Shining"" which is the most famous instance of a hotel-bound Stephen King story turned into a film. ""1408"" lacks the lunging horror and dramatic architecture to be remotely comparable. Yet watching Cusack go maniacal in a fancy hotel of his own I did think once or twice ""Heeeeres Johnny""Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

"Creepy 1408 Its Worth Checking Into washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Creepy 1408 Its Worth Checking Into The writings on the wall John Cusack as a haunted-house guidebooks author. (By David Appleby -- Dimension Films) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 22 2007 Listen up all you ""Hostels"" ""Saws"" and other purveyors of bloody terror. Think youre lords of the fright market? Lay down your whips chainsaws and paring knives to watch a truly scary movie. You might just learn something. Its called ""1408"" starring John Cusack and even though its a ghost story and you traffic in horror both genres are about manipulating our innermost fears. Unzip your leather masks and settle into your chairs -- the ones without the straps. The movie based on a Stephen King short story manages to be smart funny and terrifying all in one compelling ride. And moviegoers wont feel as if they want to take a shower afterward. Grab a bloody notebook. Weve got a few object lessons for you. Lesson 1 All you need is a simple hotel room -- not some pretentious fever dream of a torture chamber -- and a lot of imagination to grab moviegoers by the throats. When Mike Enslin (Cusack) who writes guidebooks to haunted houses checks into Room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel he learns that familiar objects -- the clock radio the thermostat the Bible the phone and a knockoff painting of ""The Hunting"" -- can become instruments of alarming menace. In fact you may never look at a household appliance innocently again. Lesson 2 You can get to your audience by making it care about the characters. Obvious true but consider the human lambs you routinely send to the slaughter -- mostly trust-fund babies and party animals who all but deserve their grisly ends. We want them dead. You want them dead. Were almost impatient to take care of business. In ""1408"" Mike may seem like a jaded hack who hasnt met a ghostly room or haunted house that ever really contained evil. But hes a man of great sensitivity who has masked his feelings and a painful family past behind that air of detachment. We sense that right away so we care whether he survives his ordeal. We also find ourselves attached to Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson) the hotel manager who begs Mike not to check into the room. He points out that 56 people have perished in that room most by their own hand. He seems like a real human being with dimension. (Casting helps too. Jacksons a naturally mischievous performer whose slightest smirk can tickle us. And Cusack is one of Hollywoods most eminently likable personalities. Were prepared to follow him to hell and back. Which we do.) Lesson 3 Have a hidden higher purpose. Sure you pretend theres a moral element to your plots something to the effect of punishing youthful arrogance but your gore flicks are merely invitations to the spectacle of torture. In ""1408"" Mike not only has to weather the scariest room since Janet Leigh stopped by the Bates Motel in ""Psycho""; with imaginative CGI surprises lying in chilly wait he has to enter the darker vortex of his own failings and the tortured past hes trying to forget. The deeper we get into this movie the more we realize we are entering the characters soul and in a way our own. Lesson 4 Theres more to audience laughter than dumb guffaws. Yes you can force reflex yuks out of moviegoers with a surprise decapitation. Better yet you can take a cue from Swedish director Mikael Hafstrom (the adultery noir ""Derailed"") who has evolved into a veritable conductor of mirth. In his hands the laughs in ""1408"" are freighted with a gamut of human response The laughter of relief after a sudden loud burst; the nervous chuckle as things get strange; the cackles interrupted by sputters of disbelief . Even as our mounting dread becomes almost intolerable ""1408"" makes us realize how rewarding it is to sit in a dark room full of people all committed to surviving an emotional ordeal -- not a brutal massacre -- alive. You can creep people out and bring them together in one entertaining scarefest. 1408 (94 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for disturbing sequences of violence and terror frightening images and profanity.

Jackson 1408 is the latest product canned by the cottage industry known as Stephen King but if you go expecting a horror movie youll be disappointed. From the start Swedish director Mikael Hafstrom works up a sweat trying to save a reputation damaged by the 2005 Clive Owen-Jennifer Aniston disaster Derailed undercutting tension by a process of anticlimax slow camera moves and ponderous music. Alas its a hopeless pursuit because the star is John Cusack whose scowling look of permanent cynicism leaves little room for audiences to explore each mystery element of the spooky unknown on their own. He telegraphs it all for them. The director might actually be a perfect match for the overwrought follow-the-dots formulas of both Mr. Kings contrived writing and Mr. Cusacks one-dimensional acting. He leaves everything for the twist ending then fails to provide one. This is the underwhelming story of a hotel room in New York where scores of people have died in ghastly ways. Mr. Cusack plays Mike Enslin a jaded author of books that debunk haunted lighthouses unfriendly poltergeists and other paranormal activities who hears about the blood-curdling events at the Dolphin Hotel where Room 1408 is always unavailable. Ignoring the warnings of the hotel manager (Samuel L. Jackson) Enslin bullies his way in confident that if he can spend one night in 1408 hell have his next best-seller. The Dolphin is not the Carlyle but its not the Bates Motel either. Still its tragic history of hangings mutilations and suicides both gruesome and amusing (one guest drowned in his chicken soup from room service) in Room 1408 (56 in all) make it an enticing rest stop for ghouls. No one has ever lasted one hour in 1408 but Enslin plans on staying all night. The hair starts to rise on the back of your neck the moment he turns the key in the lock. The thermostat sticks on 80 degrees turning the room into a sauna. Then it drops to below zero covering everything in ice. The window slams on his hand. The sink spouts boiling water. When he tries to escape the door is locked and the key breaks in half. He tosses objects from the window to attract attention but they disappear before they hit the sidewalk below. One by one the grim events that happened in the past are restaged before his eyes. He also sees the episodes from his own past in the TV set. The daughter who died young appears in the mini-bar. Theres only one way to get out of 1408--to destroy it. I went along with the about-face antics of Stephen Kings overactive imagination for about an hour before tedium took over and it was time for an explanation. Final upshot There isnt any. Regardless of how long you last in 1408 the logic to which you are entitled never comes. For the final insult the author and the filmmakers resort to the old cop-out The only ghosts in Room 1408 are the ones you invent yourself and everything that happens in there is in your own mind. In a pigs patootie. The one-room claustrophobia gives an edge to the paranoia but to hang the movies more conflicted suspense on the leers and grimaces of Mr. Cusacks face without building any sense of the mans inner demons is asking for trouble. Like Jack Nicholson in The Shining he looks more wacky than demoniac weakening the fright potential even further. The unconvincing final operatics lack the depth the audience deserves for its patience. You leave 1408 haunting yourself. Comment Filed under John Cusack On the Town Samuel L.

One can only imagine with horror what would happen if a guest asked for more towels at the Hotel Dolphin the locale of the freakily scary ""1408"" yet another film that puts ""hostile"" back in hostelry. While its certainly been the season for hotel/motel movies -- see ""Bug"" ""Vacancy"" and ""Sympathy"" -- helmer Mikael (""Derailed"") Hafstroms take on single-room occupancy is the most cinematically ambitious. For star John Cusack its a perfect fit and with a little massaging from the Weinstein Co. should emerge as one of the surprise hits of the summer. An unnerving movie that here and there succumbs to fits of effects mania ""1408"" actually manages to combine elements of Jean-Paul Sartres ""No Exit"" ""The Poseidon Adventure"" and the Carpenters -- making them all more terrifying than they already are. More remarkably perhaps ""1408"" refuses to embrace the fashionable elements of torture porn a la ""Hostel Part II"" that are currently cutting a bloody swath through the horror genre relying largely on psychological terror to impart the sense of someone possibly going mad and taking the viewer along. In Stephen Kings merrily warped world the most damning thing a character can do is ignore the supernatural writing on the wall. As seen in novels like ""The Shining"" or short stories like ""The Road Virus Heads North"" a character who displays hubris or cynicism or simply fails to acknowledge lifes mysteries usually consigns himself to the authors pile of victims. Mike Enslin (Cusack) therefore is the perfect foil for King the moral instructor A successful writer of popular books about haunted houses and possessed graveyards Mike scoffs at anything remotely paranormal but having lost a daughter to illness he doesnt quite believe in anything else either. Cusacks charmingly iconoclastic persona helps set Mike up for a lesson in metaphysical manners. By the end of ""1408"" he will definitely believe in something. The Dolphin (which coincidentally or not is also the name of a haunted hotel in the Haruki Murakami novel ""Dance Dance Dance"") is a luxury establishment on Manhattans East Side a first-rate joint save for one room. Determined to debunk the mystery of room 1408 Mike has to threaten a lawsuit to gain access to the room where he knows four people have met unlikely ends. What he doesnt know is that 50-odd people have actually died there some of apparently natural causes although the room also once drove a maid to gouge out her eyes. The official diagnosis? Its an evil room says Dolphin manager Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson). But Mike is undeterred and once he gets in finds the room has bizarre shape-shifting properties. While Hafstrom eventually turns 1408 into a frozen tomb that cracks and shifts like an arctic ice shelf its in the smaller details that the creepiness escalates The closeup of the old-fashioned lock mechanism as Mike inserts the key -- the room itself having refused any security improvements -- is a little gem of tension-building. Cusack given plenty of room to ruminate about his plight and the state of his accommodations is funny tragic and moving -- as if things werent bad enough his dead daughter Katie (Jasmine Jessica Anthony) pays him a visit while his estranged wife Lily (Mary McCormack) tries to help him via a computer screen thats been taken over by the resident incubus. Make that inn-cubus. ""1408"" is a creepshow that delivers although viewers may have second thoughts about ordering room service. Production values spearheaded by Benoit Delhommes excellent cinematography are indispensable in this tale of illusion and delusion. 1408ProductionAn MGM release of a Dimension Films presentation of a Lorenzo di Bonaventura production.
