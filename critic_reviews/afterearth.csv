Night Shyamalan and Gary Whitta wrote the screenplay for ""After Earth"" but Will Smith wrote the story. He also stars in the movie along with his son Jaden and the parental connection is not incidental. Though set millennia in the future ""After Earth"" is very much about life today--an allegory of the transition from being a helicopter parent to a free-range one--and it introduces an impressive array of futuristic paraphernalia to make the point. The action is set a thousand years after humanity had to evacuate a despoiled Earth for a distant solar system to which the species has adapted. Mankinds main obstacle is a monster race called Ursa which is blind and detects its human prey by smell--literally by the scent of fear as it emerges in the form of pheromones. Only those who have no fear have a chance of slaying an Ursa; that phenomenon of undetectable fearlessness is called ""ghosting."" Will Smith as the military commander Cypher Raige has it. His son Kitai a cadet seeking promotion to ranger only aspires to it. Father and son are passengers on a flight to another planet when their spacecraft gets caught in an asteroid storm and is forced to crash-land on Earth. Cypher and Kitai apparently the only survivors need to send a rescue signal with a special transmitter thats in the tail of the shattered craft a hundred kilometres away. Cypher broke both of his legs and so Kitai must make the journey alone. Its not giving away too much to explain that the futuristic technology (which is imagined thinly but with verve) involves a ""Naviband"" a device strapped to Kitais forearm that allows Cypher to see everything taking place around the young man and to communicate with him--in effect a super cell phone--and that the drama kicks into high gear when its disabled and Kitai has to make his way through Earths dangers on his own. The future features advanced versions of other contemporary child-safety paraphernalia such as the EpiPen and the asthma inhaler. Kitais journey of initiation subject to a set of rules (each inhaler lasts twenty to twenty-four hours; he has six inhalers; each leg of the journey takes a certain amount of time...) plays out like a live-action video game and as the movie progresses new rules present new challenges their changing demands even posted on-screen in the protagonists video arrays. Whether or not the similarity is intended its worth noting--as I discovered just now by clicking around on IMDb--that the co-scenarist Whitta ""was editor of PC Gamer for several years"" as well as a writer for the games ""Prey"" and ""The Walking Dead."" Its an aesthetically neutral matter regarding the film (though these elements do seem foregrounded in a way that is occasionally unintentionally comical) but I wonder if theres an actual ""After Earth"" game on its way. I suspect it would be a lot more fun than the movie itself. ""After Earth"" is also an allegory of the family business a public affirmation that Will Smith is yielding the spotlight to Jaden and letting him run free as an actor. Since Jaden spends much of his time on-screen as the only person in the frame the responsibility of performance does fall squarely on his young shoulders. Unfortunately Jaden though agile and skillful isnt a charismatic actor; he doesnt put a lot of personality into the part and he doesnt have a deft way with the dialogue. Meanwhile Will Smith doesnt give himself very much to do and what he does do is close to a parody of set-jawed war-movie determination. As drama ""After Earth"" offers no surprises; as action its rarely stimulating (theres exactly one shot--from Kitais point of view as hes being dragged to safety by a hidden benefactor--that reflects visual imagination); as a parenting manual it seems that Will has thrown Jaden into water thats a little too deep. For all the free-range plotting Will does play a large role in the movie suggesting all too clearly that Jaden isnt quite ready to go as far out on his own as the story suggests Kitai must. Of course its too soon to tell what kind of acting chops what kind of allure beyond the childhood cuteness of ""The Karate Kid"" Jaden Smith has. He may prove to be formidable but I suspect that to become so hell need to work in a wider range of movies perhaps a smaller scale--movies that allow him to cultivate on-screen relationships with a variety of actors including ones his own age and away from his fathers spotlight and counsel. As for Shyamalan his direction is impersonal efficient and clean--even too clean resulting in an action film that doesnt move. Its worth comparing his blandly clear images with the kinetic frenzy that the director Gary Ross working with the cinematographer Tom Stern created for ""The Hunger Games."" I wonder whether the placid stolidity of ""After Earth"" is intended to showcase the actors as if in a picture gallery--a sort of favor returned or service rendered. (Andrew Stewart reports in Variety that ""It was [Will] Smith who hand-picked Shyamalan to direct After Earth. "") Ive seen a couple of reports (here and here) speculating that ""After Earth"" is inspired by Scientology. I dont know about that but I do know that Will Smith performs with an unappealing and constrained earnestness. The movie offers no trace of Will Smith the mercurial and hearty comedian or Will Smith the introspective and fierce dramatic actor of ""Ali."" I have no idea whether its dogma paternal sentimentality or mere actorly choice that burdens him in ""After Earth"" but the result is the diminution of a superb performer his self reduced to a celebrity emblem that advertises the movie from within.

A pony? A Ferrari? How about the lead role in a major summer blockbuster conceived produced by and starring your megastar dad? After Earth sees Will Smith as the improbably named Cypher Raige noble warrior of a future race who struggles to connect to his hero-worshipping son Kitai played with quiet assurance by Smiths son Jaden. When the pair crash on post-human earth its up to Raige Jr to retrieve the homing beacon and save both their lives. To be fair this father-son project isnt as bad as it might have been Jaden is a charismatic lead and theres some nice visual design. But the recruitment of increasingly questionable director M Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense The Happening The Last Airbender) was a misstep - the action is sluggish while the theoretically justifiable decision to give every performer a bland Boston-ish non- accent gets weird fast. Most disappointing is the films lack of ambition as what could have been a sparky mainstream space opera becomes just another tedious jungle chase movie.

Also the course of events is predictable and there is no tension no sense that the hero is being hunted by a monster in the jungle.

Night Shyamalan; Release Date Wide 05/31/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 100; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Sony Pictures Entertainment Posted June 8 2013 -- 1200 AM EDT Ive lost count but After Earth seems like it must be the fourth post-apocalyptic thriller this month. The movie teams Will Smith and his son Jaden Smith and it was directed by M. Night Shyamalan the former maestro-huckster of the twist ending. But Shyamalans star has fallen and he has become a glorified gun for hire. The movie takes off from a concept as basic as a videogame and it sticks to that concept without surprise. In the dystopian future the human race has been forced to abandon a toxic earth overrun by snappy-jawed monsters that look like they came out of a Starship Troopers sequel. Will Smith plays Cypher a military Ranger famous for his total absence of fear (thats why hes invincible to the monsters who stalk their prey by smelling fear) and Jaden plays his upstart Ranger-cadet son Kitai who is traveling with him on an interplanetary mission. When an asteroid storm forces the ship to crash-land on earth Cypher is badly injured and its up to Kitai to travel a hundred kilometers on foot all to retrieve a homing beacon. But his father who can see what Kitai sees through a digital transmission talks to him as if he were a videogame avatar guiding the kid through his trek to manhood. Were not used to seeing Will Smith shorn of his lightness and humor but in After Earth hes solemn and heavy-lidded and he speaks with grave deliberation never even using contractions. He tries to make Cypher a kind of Obi-Wan figure and Smith is charismatic enough to pull this off but the father-son mentor/disciple relationship is better than the rest of the film which is like a plate of sci-fi leftovers. The knives have been out for Jaden Smith who is routinely dismissed by blogosphere snark as a lucky-duck celebrity offspring whose dad will do anything to make him a star. Im someone who thinks that Jaden Smith has a lot of talent; his moody melancholy held that Karate Kid remake together. But a movie like After Earth in which he mostly has to act all by himself taking orders from his father as he dodges post-apocalyptic cliches isnt doing him any favors.

Night Shyamalans career over the past decade from the idiocies of The Village to the did-that-really-happen awfulness of The Happening to the generic ineptitude of The Last Airbender. So I feel its incumbent on me to note that with his latest offering After Earththe writer-director seems to have arrested his precipitous decline. This movie is no worse than his last two. Related Story The Lightweight Appeal of Star Trek Into Darkness That said Im not sure its any better though apportioning blame in this instance is a bit complicated. Shyamalans involvement notwithstanding After Earth is a vanity project of the burgeoning multinational Will Smith Inc. The movie stars Smith and his 14-year-old son Jaden. Its produced by Smith his wife Jada Pinkett Smith brother-in-law Caleeb Pinkett and longtime friend and business partner James Lassiter. And its based on a story written by Smith as a vehicle for his son a story that he conceived while he and his brother-in-law were watching television together. Which is a long way of saying that it might be best to give Shyamalan a pass on this one. The year (and original title of the project) is 1000 A.E.--that is a thousand years after humankind has departed Earth for less environmentally despoiled pastures. General Cypher Raige (Smith pere) is the legendary head of the Ranger Corps a military unit tasked with combating alien creatures called ""ursas"" H. R. Giger-y monstrosities that have no eyes but can (literally) smell fear. Exemplar of courage that he is Cypher is entirely odor-free and is thus able to wander among the ursas with impunity stabbing them at will with his high-tech ""cutlass."" (Projectile weapons have evidently--and inconveniently--fallen out of favor for reasons never made clear.)But rangering doesnt come as easily to the generals son Kitai (Smith fils) who has serious issues with fear-management. Being a teenager hes also petulant entitled and insubordinate. So when Dad announces hes going on One Last Mission Before Retiring To Spend Time With His Family--youd think Will Smith would have been around long enough to know what this portends for a black character in Hollywood--Mom (Sophie Okonedo) suggests he bring the boy along with him. The routine operation quickly turns not-routine of course and the starship carrying Cypher and Kitai crash lands on the long-abandoned Earth killing everyone else on board and breaking both of Cyphers legs. Worse the ship has split into two halves and the only functional distress beacon is on the other half 100 kilometers away. So it falls to Kitai to make the journey alone a task that will be difficult for a variety of reasons. First as Cypher explains since our departure all life on the planet ""has evolved to kill humans."" (Why life would evolve to hunt a prey that is no longer present is another of those questions the film declines to tackle.) Second Cypher and Kitais ship was carrying an ursa to be used for ranger-training purposes that has escaped and is also on the prowl. And a final two-fer Earths temperature drops to lethal extremes every night (lethal to human beings that is not to any of the abundant native flora and fauna) necessitating that Kitai reach a ""hot spot"" before each bedtime; and the atmosphere has thickened such that Kitai must ingest a precious ""breathing liquid""--of which there is an inadequate supply--every 20 to 24 hours. (Given the abundance of ""rules"" it will perhaps come as no surprise that Shyamalans co-writer on the screenplay Gary Whitta is a video-game journalist and consultant.)So Kitai sets out on his quest with his dad literally looking over his shoulder via the cameras and sensors embedded in his suit. When Kitais mom had recommended this particular parental-bonding excursion she told her husband ""He doesnt need a commanding officer. He needs a father."" But as Cypher counsels his son remotely its hard to shake the sense that the role he is truly embracing is that of acting coach. ""Root yourself in this present moment now"" he tells the boy. ""Recognize your power. This will be your creation."" And... sceneIm not sure Ive ever seen a film in which the text and subtext--both concerning an effortlessly gifted father who presses his less-talented son to follow in his footsteps--so completely aligned. There are any number of other quibbles one might make regarding After Earth from its second-rate CGI to its generic score to its empty references to Moby Dick. The let-us-walk-you-through-this expository dialogue will be familiar to anyone who saw The Last Airbender--guess what it bodes when Cypher warns ""I want to reiterate that your navi-band is our sole means of communication""--as will be the insistently yet unidentifiably British Empire accents (Kiwi? Indian?) adopted by most of the cast in what seems like an ill-advised effort to class up the production. These manifold shortcomings might recede in importance if After Earth had a compelling protagonist at its center. But it doesnt. The younger Smith is persuasive enough--at times perhaps a bit too persuasive--in his portrayal of an awkward tentative adolescent but he is entirely lacking in the big-screen charisma that made his father one of Hollywoods major stars. Indeed Im not sure Ive ever seen a film in which the text and subtext--both concerning an effortlessly gifted father who presses his less-talented son to follow in his footsteps--were so completely in alignment. Alas only in one of the two does the story end happily.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side. Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P.

In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Chris Keane / Reuters North Carolinas Deliberate Disenfranchisement of Black Voters David A.

The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting.

Khizr Khan began his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday with words I wish he didnt have to say ""Tonight we are honored to stand here as parents of Captain Humayun Khan and as patriotic American Muslims--as patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country."" I wish he and his wife didnt have to stand there as the parents of a 27-year-old Army captain who was killed by suicide bombers while serving in the Iraq War. And I wish Khizr Khan hadnt felt the need to declare his patriotism and loyalty to the United States of America. Those truths should have been self-evident. The state of the union is not strong when an American feels compelled to clarify such things. In better times Khizr Khan who was born in Pakistan and moved to America from the United Arab Emirates might have begun his speech with what he said next ""Like many immigrants we came to this country empty-handed. We believed in American democracy--that with hard work and [the] goodness of this country we could share in and contribute to its blessings.""

James Fallows None Mark Salter former chief of staff to Sen. John McCain has written an essay for Real Clear Politics on why he cannot vote for Donald Trump. It deserves note for the long-term record because this is not how associates of a partys former nominee usually talk about the current one and because of its insistence on the importance of tax returns. Salter concludes (emphasis added) Could it be that a major party nominee for president is beholden to Russias leader and might compromise the security interests of the U.S. and our allies to maintain that relationship?  We dont know the answer.... We cant begin to answer the question until Trump releases his tax returns for the last several years. The media should make this the focus of every interview with Trump and senior Trump staff. The Republican Party chairman should urge him to release his returns. The Republican leadership in Congress should insist on it. Every American voter should demand it. There are legitimate suspicions about whether Trumps business relationships could compromise his loyalty to our country. Unless and until he puts them to rest not by dismissing them but by disproving them he should be considered unfit to hold the office of president. Continue Reading Zak Bickel / The Atlantic From Whitewater to Benghazi A Clinton-Scandal Primer David A. Graham The State Department is reopening its investigation into Hillary Clintons emails just as she puts a Justice Department investigation behind her. Hillary Clinton is out of the frying pan and into the fire. On July 6 Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that the Justice Department would not pursue criminal charges against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for her use of a private email server at the State Department. But the following day with that criminal investigation closed the State Department reopened its own probe into the emails the AP reported. State Department spokesman John Kirby told the AP that it would be looking at potential mishandling of classified information by Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Former officials could face administrative sanctions including a loss of their security clearances--a step that would be both politically embarrassing for Clinton and complicate efforts to staff a national-security team should she prevail in November.

Night Shyamalan sci-fi blockbuster. 21 Shares Share 14 Tweet 6 Share 0 Share Email Print Share Photo Courtesy of Columbia Pictures. By the standards of M. Nights Shyamalans recent films After Earth is surprisingly not horrible. Of course its not especially Shyamalanesque insofar as there are no thigh-slapping climactic revelations on the order of ""Swing away"" ""The airport even changed the flight paths"" ""The scrunt wants her because shes not just a narf shes a madame narf"" and everyones favorite ""Lets just stay ahead of the wind"" The Shyamster is now working as a (high-paid) hired hand to help Will Smith contrive a gazillion-dollar vehicle for his teenage son Jaden. At the premiere at Manhattans Ziegfeld Theater the ebullient director said that Will Smith ""brought the muscularity"" he (Shyamalan) the ""stillness"" and Jaden the ""innocence."" Jaden certainly seems an innocent vis-a-vis any acting technique. But hes earnest. Unlike say our last president he must want to look as if he actually earned his silver spoon. Ironically enough the present that Will Smith has handed to his son is the story of a boy who desperately needs to prove himself to his father. A thousand years ago we learn humans fled the Earth after rendering what was once a paradise uninhabitable. They now reside on ""Nova Prime."" (A whole millennium and they cant come up with a less generic name.) Their principal enemy is a special effect called an Ursa that takes advantage of human fear. Will Smiths Commander Cypher is a legendary Ursa killer owing to his ability to become invisible a ""ghost."" Jadens Kitai on the other hand must look to the Ursa like a porterhouse steak. Smith Jr. has been directed to telegraph his anxiety like mad chewing his lips and popping his eyes putting accordion-like creases in his brow -- this so he can be counseled by his father onscreen to do less. ""Fear is not real"" intones Cypher. ""It is a product of our imagination. Danger is real but fear is a choice."" Most of the movie is Jaden running and jumping and looking scared while a gravely injured Will sits and watches him on a monitor in the wreckage of a ship that has just happened to crash-land on a Class D planet thats ""unfit for human habitation."" Three guesses which one. Everything here says Cypher has ""evolved to kill humans"" -- which wont surprise anyone who lived through Shyamalans killer trees. (""We dont know how plants obtain these abilities they just evolve very rapidly."" -- The Happening) Cypher has to guide his son 100 kilometers to find a lost beacon and avoid sundry native predators -- as well as a non-native Ursa that happened to be onboard their spaceship and seems destined (i.e. studio-programmed) to meet up with Kitai on top of a fiery mountain at the precise instant when the potential for salvation is upon him. Can Kitai choose not to be afraid? More important can Jaden somehow control his overemoting? Once you accept the simpleminded setup its possible to relax and let the silliness run its course. After Earth has a relatively lean palette. Ships that look like Stingrays move sinuously through space. The gradual icing of the landscape as nightfall approaches is done with a senseis subtlety. A cornball subplot involving a giant bird is nicely underplayed. Shyamalan handles the climactic appearance of the Ursa as if he studied Ridley Scotts Alien and understood that the less you can focus on the threat the scarier it is. (He knew that when he made Signs too.) Theres one other element that snuck past my defenses. To breathe on Earth Kitai needs a daily inhaler and when two of the vials become smashed Cypher writhes at the prospect of his sons inability to breathe. Were Shyamalan and Smith deliberately invoking the terror -- now omnipresent in urban African-American communities -- of lethal asthma attacks in children? Im not sure how I feel about something so real and so wrenching in the context of a Grade D (unfit for human habitation) sci-fi picture like After Earth. But unlike those killer trees (""Lets just stay ahead of the wind"") you cant laugh it off.

Night Shyamalan and takes itself too seriously. After Earth stars Will Smith as a fierce father and his real-life son Jaden as his cadet son. By Peter Rainer Film critic May 31 2013 Save for later Saved After Earth stars Jaden Smith. Claudette Barius/Sony - Columbia Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Video After Earth trailer Monitor Movie Guide Will Smith plays an interplanetary ranger in M. Night Shyamalans dreary ""After Earth"" which is set a thousand years in the future although it all seemed too drearily present-day to me. The gimmick here is that Smiths son is played by Jaden Smith his actual son.Smiths ranger is a martinet ranger whose cadet son desperately wants to live up to his fathers impossibly high standards. He gets the chance when their spaceship crash-lands on the planet Earth which humans were forced to evacuate a thousand years earlier due to a global cataclysm. The boy in order to rescue his dad and himself - the vessels sole survivors - faces off against everything from neo-condors to gloppy monsters. (Not withstanding the movies misleading ads Jaden has far more screen time than Will.)But his fiercest adversary is the screenplay. Replete with howlers it had the audience I saw the film with in titters from very early on. Jaden Smith was a good little actor in ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" in which he also costarred to much better effect with his father. Will Smiths patriarch never cracks a smile. Thats how you know hes serious. But its impossible to take this movie seriously certainly not as seriously as it takes itself.

"After Earth | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; after-earth ) After Earth (United States 2013) May 31 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli The sad truth about After Earth is that not only is it difficult to find things it does well but there are numerous examples of outright incompetence dotting the landscape. Outside of some nice visuals its impossible to find a reason to recommend the film which feels overlong at 100 minutes as it plods through a tiresome adventure quest that sends a boy out into the wilderness on his own in a hostile environment prowled by bad CGI animals and stupid plot contrivances. When it comes to bringing animals to life on a computer someone should have consulted Ang Lee. If the lions and eagles in After Earth had looked remotely believable maybe I wouldnt have occasionally entertained the idea that this big budget misfire was intended to be a parody. M. Night Shyamalan has fallen so far from grace that Columbia Pictures elected not to use his name in the marketing of After Earth. This time around Shyamalans trademark third-act twist is missing in action - as is anything resembling competent storytelling. The project feels stillborn. The characters are emotionally neutered; the average viewer wont care about them. The pacing is plodding and uneven. The story trajectory is so obvious that one of Shyamalans cheesy surprises would have been welcome but the director is stuck in Last Airbender mode and thats not a good thing. The story opens with a B-movie sci-fi prologue - kind of like a Starship Troopers without its tongue planted in its cheek. The setup is that more than 1000 years in the future mankind has abandoned Earth and set up shop elsewhere (second time in six weeks thats happened; its becoming a bad habit). After fighting (and winning) a war against aliens called the Ursa (ugly generic space creatures) theyre putting things back together. Supreme big wig military honcho Cypher Kaige (Will Smith) and his estranged son Kitai (Jaden Smith) become stranded on Earth when their crippled spaceship crash lands killing all aboard except the two Kaiges. With Cypher badly wounded Kitai must hike 100 km across country to find the tail section of the ship which contains the rescue beacon. Along the way he is menaced by a number of Earths mutated creatures and a displaced Ursa who can ""smell his fear."" Flashbacks reconstruct the Kaiges family life before Kitais sister was killed. After Earths intention is to highlight father/son bonding and Kitais coming of age through extraordinary circumstances. Both themes are botched. With Will and Jaden Smith sharing only a handful of scenes the relationship stagnates as they communicate first by a video device and then not at all. The screenplays inept attempts to transform Kitai from a frightened kid into a hero are equally unconvincing. At his best Kitai is an irritating whiner and his sudden forced ""discovery"" of key survival qualities is laughable. Theres something appealing about the notion of a boy alone on a hostile world fighting to survive. The journey can be nail-biting and at times exhilarating (Ill once again reference Life of Pi). Unfortunately Shyamalan transforms it into a connect-the-dots excursion into the obvious. Theres never a sense that Kitai is in any real danger. When hes chased by a large number of baboons we know hes going to get away. When a parasite poisons his blood we know hes going to inject the antidote. The problem isnt that Kitai survives the ordeal but that his survival is never in doubt. Theres no suspense or excitement - just boredom. Can a lions share of After Earths deficiencies be laid at the feet of Jaden Smith? For whatever reason he proves unsuited to the role (in contrast to The Karate Kid) but its unclear how much of his overwrought clumsy performance is a result of limited innate ability and how much derives from a bad screenplay wanting to highlight Kitais immaturity and the coldness of his relationship with his father. As for Jadens real life dad Will Smith After Earth doesnt require him to do more than adopt a dour persona and spend 75% of the film trapped alone in a dilapidated spaceship with two broken legs. His thousand-watt charisma has been disconnected. Once or twice I thought the film might venture into Rear Window territory but After Earth lacks that kind of ambition. After Earth makes the similarly-motivated Oblivion seem a lot better realized than it did upon a first viewing. In a time when post-apocalyptic stories have become popular (a trend that illustrates something about a cultural mindset) After Earth falls into almost every imaginable pitfall and lies near the nadir of the overstuffed sub-genre. The film fails not only as science fiction but as a drama and an adventure. But hey that herd of buffalo sweeping across the plains looks damn impressive. After Earth (United States 2013) Director M.

"After Earth (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review After Earth (PG-13) Will Smith and his son Jaden crash-land on a ruined toxic Earth in this family-friendly sci-fi adventure. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com5/30/2013 Editor rating 2 One thousand years after mankind abandoned Earth a spaceship crashes on the planet killing everyone aboard except the commanding officer Cypher (Will Smith) and his teenage son Kitai (Jaden Smith) who is trying to live up to his fathers legendary military record. As Cyphers leg is broken he cant walk so Kitai must venture outside by himself find the tail of the shattered vessel and obtain a homing beacon that will send help. But in the ensuing years since human beings bailed all animal life on Earth has devolved into snarling beasts and they exist only to kill. There are also some enormous alien monsters who attack their prey when they sense their fear. Cypher has learned the ability of ""ghosting"" which means never being afraid. His son though isnt quite there yet. Much of After Earth follows Kitai on his adventure through this perilous planet dodging mutant gorillas lions and snakes while following his fathers orders via an intercom he wears on his wrist. The movie was directed by M. Night Shyamalan whose career has hit a bit of a rough patch (Lady in the Water The Last Airbender The Happening) but he retains his sense of great composition and a strong grasp of narrative using only visuals. But even though he co-wrote the screenplay Shyamalan isnt the star this time. After Earth belongs to the young Jaden who holds your attention despite being the only person on screen for long stretches of the film. Instead of playing the character as heroic Jaden conveys terror fear and awe often without dialogue. Hes a gifted actor who will get even better with time. Too bad hes forced so often to ""take a knee"" as his father does when he needs to calm down an action that bears an uncanny resemblance to Tebowing (OK its the exact same thing). Too bad too that the CGI creatures in the film look as fake as the monkeys in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull Every time a dangerous critter pops up youre taken out of the movie as if youd just hit the eject button on your seat. Even worse the story doesnt make much sense In a thousand years wouldnt all the surviving animals rabid and savage have had already killed and eaten each other? After Earth which is pitched squarely at fathers and their 12 year-old sons is never awful -- you dont laugh at it the way you did with some of Shyamalans other pictures -- but unlike the recent Oblivion which at least threw out a couple of plot twists after the premise was established theres nothing more to this movie than the set-up. Even though Cypher is slowly bleeding to death and Kitai is running out of oxygen capsules that allow him to breathe in the toxic air theres no sense of urgency either. At least Shyamalan sensing the thinness of the material doesnt stretch things out. After Earth gets the job done but he didnt exactly set a high bar for himself.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 31 2013 705 AM After Earth Will Smith tries to coach his son into becoming an action hero. By Dana Stevens Will and Jaden Smith in M. Night Shyamalans After Earth Photo courtesy of Sony Pictures In the future--at least the one imagined in After Earth the M. Night Shyamalan sci-fi adventure conceived by Will Smith who also stars opposite his 14-year-old son Jaden--our planet will be evacuated after environmental degradation has rendered it unfit to support human life. Those humans who survive will settle on a distant arid planet called Nova Prime where all architecture is modeled after the Eero Saarinen terminal at Kennedy Airport where all garments and surfaces are dominated by a curious honeycomb pattern and where we eat our meals with implements that resemble three Lucite chopsticks joined at one end. Thats about as much detail as Shyamalan and his co-screenwriter Gary Whitta care to provide about the culture of the colonized planet on which their tale begins. Really After Earth is barely science fiction at all. The films vision of a ravaged post-human Earth is less a jumping-off point for speculation about our collective future than it is an excuse to strand the two main characters the magnificently named General Cypher Raige (Will Smith) and his son Kitai (Jaden Smith) on an otherwise abandoned planet Earth where the spaceship they were flying on a routine mission has been forced to make a crash landing. Everyone but the two tough-as-nails Raiges is killed and Cyphers legs are both broken (""one of them very badly"" he informs his son in a tone flinty enough to imply a compound fracture amounts to a minor hassle). Its up to the inexperienced but arrogant Kitai to make the 100-kilometer trek to the wreckage of the ships tail where theres a device that can send up an SOS signal to their home planet. (Basically this is the next-millennium equivalent of those safety flares your dad kept in the car trunk.) Once you accept the elemental simplicity of After Earths plot--its a Joseph Campbell heros journey straight down the line--you can stop resenting the movie for all the things its not (a rollicking summer actioner a typical Shyamalan twist-based narrative). Theres a compelling creepiness to this quasi-mythical quest tale about a boy who must symbolically kill his father in order to save both their lives. Many summer action movies use the macho one-upmanship between fathers and sons as subplot or subtext; here its both plot and text. And the fact that the battling Raiges () are played by a real-life father-and-son pair--not to mention such a powerful famous and publicly eccentric one--only intensifies After Earths allegorical weirdness. Advertisement The movies structure is as simple as a board game Kitai must traverse a preselected path between their crash site and the tail avoiding obstacles along the way. These obstacles include super-predators who have evolved in ways dangerous to humans (a pack of slavering leopard-like hyenas a bird of prey roughly the size of a jeep); an insectoid alien that can smell human fear; and extreme weather conditions (for reasons not well explained the Earth freezes over completely every night so Kitai can survive only by locating geothermal pockets of warmth). For most of his journey the boy is accompanied virtually by his dads voice and face on his naviband a device he wears on a cuff around his arm. This paternal Panopticon augmented by another camera on Kitais back and still more in the air enables Cypher to observe every last detail of his sons behavior. When Kitai lies about how many oxygenated breathing capsules he has left (hes broken some in a fall) Raige pere makes him put his money where his mouth is and display the remaining capsules on screen. Im not sure whether Shyamalan intended this middle section to be a commentary on parental surveillance in the age of Facebook but I can imagine how those cumulative busted-by-dad moments (and young Kitais eventual act of rebellion) might resonate with teenage viewers. In the last half-hour after Kitai slips the bounds of his fathers tech-assisted overparenting the movie gives full voice to its animating philosophy which resides somewhere at the convergence point of Life of Pi Dianetics and Stuart Smalleys daily affirmations. Fear is not real; be in the now; you had the power in you all along. In the climactic scene cut off from communication with Cypher Kitai performs a kind of channeling act in which his fathers voice now internalized as his own common sense talks him toward a solution which I wont detail except to say that it involves some of the most triumphantly phallic use of technology since Luke Skywalker first brandished a lightsaber. Kitais dad-assisted apotheosis serves as an almost too-precise metaphor for whats been happening the whole movie with the hardworking but less than mesmerizing Jaden Smith standing in as proxy action hero for his sacrificially self-sidelined father. In his defense the kid is saddled with a task that even a more experienced actor might have trouble pulling off He must carry an entire action movie on his slender shoulders given little more to act opposite than a succession of green-screen predators. Even with his charismatic dad in his earpiece calling the shots Jaden cant turn himself into a movie star by sheer force of Will. Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic.

Night Shyamalan Starring Will Smith Jaden Smith Classification PG Year 2013 Country USA Language English Science fictions most thriving subset the postapocalyptic survival spectacle gets a martial coming-of-age spin in M. Night Shyamalans After Earth with a young boy Kitai Raige (Jaden Smith) hustling his narrow butt across 100 kilometres of a hostile planet Earth to retrieve a life-saving message beacon that will summon help for him and his crash-landed dad Cypher (Will Smith real-life dad to Jaden). Multimedia After Earth The official trailer The set up One thousand years after Earth was abandoned - not even Tom Cruise stuck around - all life forms on the planet have rather petulantly evolved to kill humans. On a trip where he intends to guide his son through the requisite training rituals of ""ghosting"" which means conquering your fears so completely that nasty man-eating creatures wont be able to smell you sweat Cyphers ship goes down on the forsaken planet killing all aboard but him and his son. Cypher - a legendary ""ghost"" - is too badly injured to do anything but monitor his sons progress while gravely intoning such unsoothing paternal bromides as ""Dont get me wrong. Danger is real. Fear is a choice"" and Kitai must run a gauntlet of hyper-hostile natural elements and one highly motivated ghost-training monster sprung by the wreck. No whimpering allowed. Become a drone or die alone.Replacing the customary doomsday barrenness with a computer-generated verdancy that suggests a National Geographic special conceived by gaming geeks After Earth at least looks distinctive and the movies overall atmosphere of close-quarter jungle delirium is enhanced by the cramped earth-toned interiors of spaceships off-world colony condos and crashed cockpits. When Kitai is dispatched into an atmosphere where breathable air is at a premium the gasping comes honestly.Production notes reveal After Earth was originally conceived by star Smith as a tale of a camping trip gone wrong but mutated into a full-blown summer CGI-fest when it was presumably realized that a) that more ancillary spinoff stuff (video games comics toys etc.) could be sold if it supplanted spaceships for SUVs; b) that few of us would sit still for a movie about Will Smith talking to his son over a cellphone no matter how many angry bears were lurking about; c) that camping-trip-gone-wrong movies sort of peaked with Deliverance; and d) that young Jaden Smith was probably far more at home skedaddling for his life across an angry postapocalyptic planet Earth than pretending hed ever been on a camping trip.When it came to casting the right director Smith apparently turned to the gifted but surprise-ending-prone Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense Signs Lady in the Water) which makes this movie the first the director has made from someone elses script. That there are no surprises (jumps yes surprises no) should surprise no one - Will Smith movies must uplift the human spirit and reaffirm our best instincts while reassuring us that our ticket money has been well invested. Ergo the Earth may have come to a savage and unhappy end but that doesnt mean the movie has to follow suit.

ENLARGE Will Smith left and Jaden Smith in After Earth. Columbia Pictures By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com May 30 2013 500 p.m. ET Is ""After Earth"" the worst movie ever made? Maybe not; theres always ""Battlefield Earth"" to remind us how low the bar can go. But thats the wrong question since it implies that this bizarre enterprise is a movie in the conventional sense. At first the production exhibits movielike characteristics a sort of ""Star Trudge"" crossed with a heros journey by way of Joseph Campbell. The story begins on a planet that has served as humanitys refuge since Earth became uninhabitable. Will Smith is Cypher Raige the commanding general of a U.N.-sanctioned peacekeeping group--Im only reporting whats on the screen--called the United Ranger Corps. Mr. Smiths son Jaden Smith is the generals son Kitai a painfully earnest 13-year-old whos desperately seeking approval from his authoritarian father even though the old man seems to have no approval to give. Despite the sci-fi trappings and dollops of almost literally unspeakable dialogue--""Graviton buildup could be a precursor to mass expansion"" someone warns someone else--""After Earth"" is basically a two-character study of what happens to father and son after their spaceship crashes on a quarantined planet that is in fact Earth but Earth infested with exceedingly cheesy digital monsters. Watch a clip from the film ""After Earth."" A crash landing leaves Kitai Raige (Jaden Smith) and his father Cypher (Will Smith) stranded on Earth 1000 years after events forced humanitys escape. (Photo/Video Sony) Here again the action conforms to a recognizable movie template. With his father gravely injured and unable to extricate himself from the ships wreckage Kitai must summon the courage to go forth on his own and fight whatever demons come his way in order to find the electronic beacon that will bring lifesaving help. In other words a familiar tale of a boy surviving vicissitudes to become a man. Yet this variant of the template as directed by M. Night Shyamalan from a script he wrote with Gary Whitta--and based on a story by Mr. Smith--soon takes the form of turgid pontifications that Cypher lays on Kitai at every step of the poor kids way. (Theyre connected by a fancy communication system that only emphasizes the disconnections of the quasidramatic structure.) ""Every single decision you make will be life or death"" the general intones. Or rather ""Every...single...decision...you...make...will...be...life...or...death"" because every...single...word...the...general...speaks...is...spoken...slowly...for...emphasis. Its gravity without gravitas. Ive never seen a movie that moves so slowly or takes itself so seriously which is why it doesnt seem like a movie at all but a sermon whose central subject is fear ""Danger is real"" the father tells the son ""but fear is a choice."" So a right question might be why ""After Earth"" was made. The sermon echoes a central theme of Scientology. Is that the productions subtext or are there reasons yet to be uncovered why humor and humanity have been essentially banished; why everyone looks pained; why the very notion of entertainment has been banished in favor of grinding didacticism and why Mr. Smith who has been such a brilliant entertainer over the years and decades looks as if he has undergone a radical charismaectomy? It...is...all...very...mysterious...and...deeply...dreary. Watch a clip from the film ""The East."" An operative finds her priorities changing after she is tasked with infiltrating an anarchist group known for executing covert attacks upon major corporations. (Photo/Video Fox Searchlight) The East In one of many anxiety-provoking sequences in ""The East"" the heroine Sarah who is played by Brit Marling must find a way to feed herself even though she like her companions at a large dinner table in an abandoned house has had her arms tied up in a straitjacket. (The solution is both practical and symbolic.) Part of the anxiety--good anxiety almost as good as suspense--grows out of the situation Sarah is in a scary spot. A former FBI agent newly hired by a private intelligence group she has infiltrated an anarchist collective thats bent on punishing corporations for their supposed crimes. I felt bad anxiety though about the cartoonish characters--hippie stereotypes clumsily updated plus smarmy corporate execs--and about Ms. Marling a gifted actress tying herself up in a story thats essentially a glib preachment to the anticorporate choir. ENLARGE Brit Marling in The East. Fox Searchlight The film takes its title from the name of the collective a shadowy group whose leader Benji ( Alexander Skarsgard) has a tragic past and a fatalists view of the turbulent present ""Things would be easier"" he tells Sarah ""if we didnt feel the need to fight."" She feels the need to fight against falling in love with him and against being radicalized in the course of her dangerous mission. Ms. Marling makes Sarahs moral dilemma interesting even sporadically convincing; shes an unusually economical actress who can express unspoken feelings with a piercing glance or pensive stare. But Sarahs exertions in the action realm--listening to the tumblers as she cracks a safe feeling for a bullet in a shooting victims belly--are hard to take seriously. Its harder still to find any grounding in contemporary life for the vengeful anarchists. They operate in a realm thats part Woody Guthrie from the 1930s--hobos in freight cars beset by brutal railroad bulls--and part counterculture from the 1960s with an overlay of up-to-the-minute ecoterrorism. ( Ellen Page plays one member of the collective Izzy; her father runs a company that has dumped arsenic in its local water supply. Patricia Clarkson is Sharon the intelligence-group boss who hires Sarah after warning her about the dangers of the ego and of being too smart. Roman Vasyanov did the handsome cinematography.) ""The East"" was directed by Zal Batmanglij from a script he wrote with Ms. Marling. Two years ago they collaborated on ""Sound of My Voice"" the directors small but impressive debut feature. In that film Ms. Marling played an enigmatic beauty who might have been as she claimed a time-traveler from the future or the cynical priestess of a crackpot cult in the San Fernando Valley. This new film deals with cult behavior in a different setting. Sarah whod been listening to Christian radio in her car on her way to applying for the counterterrorism job must renounce her faith at least outwardly by submitting to the collectives secular version of a baptism. The whole movie has the smugness of a cult. At one and the same time its devoid of reality and insufferably full of itself. Watch a clip from the film ""Deceptive Practice The Mysteries and Mentors of Ricky Jay"" a documentary on the world-renowned magician author historian and actor. (Photo/Video Hopscotch Films) Deceptive Practice The Mysteries and Mentors of Ricky Jay Maybe I should have recused myself from reviewing Molly Bernsteins marvelous documentary which opened while I was on vacation and is now entering national release. For one thing I count myself a friend of the main subject the peerless magician historian and actor Ricky Jay. For another I would have been satisfied if the film had contained nothing but closeups of his hands manipulating a deck of cards--shuffles and arcs and cascades fans appearing and vanishing as in a silent version of ""The Mikado"" accompanied by visual music. But Im no more prejudiced in his favor than anyone else who has seen him perform. Nor do I know any more than anyone else about how he does the astonishing things he does. And the film isnt only about him though it does contain such closeups and some fascinating footage of his early performances. The larger subjects eloquently evoked are the sources of his knowledge and inspiration and the singular tradition within which he works and flourishes. ENLARGE Ricky Jay in the documentary Deceptive Practice. Kino Lorber Its a tradition that goes back more than a century a continuum of virtuosi with names to conjure with Malini Houdini Kellar Thurston Slydini Cardini Charlie Miller the unquenchably comic Al Flosso the incomparable Dai Vernon. Magic is inherently honest the film insists; you tell people youre going to deceive them before you deceive them. But honesty isnt the issue; enchantment is. For a working definition of the word watch Ricky Jay watching his fingers as they tear a piece of paper into the shape of a moths wings and--watch closely now--the paper moth turns into a real moth that silently flutters away. DVD Focus Hitch (2005) ENLARGE Will Smith and Eva Mendes Columbia Pictures/Everett Collection Will Smith is a self-styled date doctor Alex Hitchens in an uneven but likable comedy that Andy Tennant directed from an original script by Kevin Bisch. When the film came out I wrote that Mr. Smith ""has been a fluid concept until now--immensely likable reliably droll and self-assured though never self-important."" Self-importance and solemnity have set in since then but ""Hitch"" allows its star to fulfill what seemed like his manifest destiny at the time--becoming an urbane comedian who is also shades of Cary Grant a romantic hero. Eva Mendes is alluring as a gossip columnist. Melancholia (2011) ENLARGE Alexander Skarsgard is an immature husband-to-be in this hauntingly beautiful drama by the Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier. Kirsten Dunst is the wife-to-be Justine beset by depression in a movie that isnt depressing at all. Its true subject is melancholia as a spiritual state a destroyer of happiness that emerges from its hiding place behind the sun just like the menacing planet of the film that may or may not put an end to terrestrial life. The extraordinary cast includes Charlotte Gainsbourg Charlotte Rampling Kiefer Sutherland John Hurt and Alexanders father Stellan Skarsgard. Heist (2001) ENLARGE Ricky Jay is Pinky Pincus a sad-faced associate of Joe Moore the zestful mastermind played by Gene Hackman in David Mamets intricately entertaining caper. One assessment of Joe comes from Bobby ( Delroy Lindo) a hitherto stalwart member of his crew after Joes plans for an ambitious robbery have seemingly turned to dross. ""Baby"" Bobby says ""you got old."" Another comes from Pinky. Joe is so cool Pinky says that ""when he goes to bed sheep count him."" Which appraisal to bank on? An easy call if youre familiar with the movies of Mr. Mamet whose specialty is scammers scamming scammers.

"Review After Earth crashes on take-off - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review After Earth crashes on take-off Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic I have so many questions after seeing ""After Earth"" the new sci-fi action-adventure starring Will Smith and his 14-year-old son Jaden.First just how much blinding power is in that famous smile of his? On the day Will Smith floated the idea -- ""sci-fi flick father-son friction me and the kid will star"" -- did its sheer warmth and radiance make everyone in the room believe that anything including ""After Earth"" as an actual viable movie was possible? Someone wrote the checks.VIDEO Upcoming summer films And then someone hired a director. Which leads to another question Have alien body snatchers made off with M. Night Shyamalan?There is no small irony that this sci-fi action adventure is about surviving a serious crash. The scorched earth left behind by ""After Earth"" is sure to leave a scar on everyone involved.Although the Smith franchise will no doubt recover the toxic ozone hanging over Shyamalan wont lift any time soon.""After Earth"" has a hint of the skin-crawling fright of Shyamalan films past the ethereal palette he favors echoes of the tender human touches we saw in his Oscar-nominated ""The Sixth Sense."" Enough to feel that Shyamalan is still in there fighting since ""Signs"" in 2002 to regain control. But not enough to save ""After Earth."" And not enough to explain why the directors films keep getting worse. It must be body snatchers ones from a planet that has no clue how to make a movie.PHOTOS Summer Sneaks 2013 Has Smith forgotten that his strength is his warmth his humanity? The effortless charm of his turns in ""Men in Black"" ""Six Degrees of Separation"" and of course ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" which ruled the 90s does not even show up for a cameo in ""After Earth.""That failure to communicate cannot be chalked up to the movies more serious tone. The actor was equally charismatic in the far more serious ""The Pursuit of Happyness."" Smith earned that Oscar nod for his portrayal of the homeless Wall Street-hopeful/single dad another father-son story that featured Jaden.The bones of Smiths story are not the problem. The issues churned up by an A-type dad with high expectations and a sons failure to measure up are classic. Its the transition to screenplay by Gary Whitta who wrote the post-apocalyptic tale ""The Book of Eli"" and Shyamalan that is rocky.The script has no nuance none. And when Shyamalan moves into the directors chair the script problems are magnified.PHOTOS Celebrities by The TimesEverything is spelled out underlined in red. Take the close-up on a ""Restricted Access"" sign followed by the overkill of having someone proceed to explain what ""Restricted Access"" means.Speaking of overkill flashbacks thousands of them become things to be feared as much as any space alien.Smith plays Cypher a tightly wound high-ranking United Ranger protectors of humanity 1000 years after Earth could no longer sustain life as we know it. Mankind now lives on planet Nova Prime. Its resident aliens the Skrel have created a monster race called the Ursa genetically bred to hunt humans. The Ursas are blind only able to sniff out our kind by smelling fear. That particular quirk will set up one of the films major themes -- fear and how to control it or preferably not have it at all ever.After a very dull opening narration to lay out all that history the film finally gets underway as Kitai (Jaden Smith) is finding out that he failed the test to become a Ranger like Dad. Hes bummed and worse Dads due home for dinner tonight after a long stretch patrolling the galaxy and hell be bummed too. But Kitais scientist mom Faia (Sophie Okonedo) thinks she has the cure -- a father-son bonding trip.After a few recriminations over dinner Cypher tells Kitai to pack his bag. Not for vacation but to tag along on Dads next military mission.PHOTOS Hollywood backlot momentsLets take a moment to talk about the sci-fi effects. In this age of incredible ones most of ""After Earths"" seem inspired by the 1950s one generation beyond tinfoil. The spacecraft looks exactly like a giant flying stingray sans the tail. Which might not matter but .... When the craft crashes on a still hostile Earth the only survivors -- Cypher critically injured and Kitai scared to step up -- are in the front of the craft while the life-saving beacon is in the ""tail"" section.The rest of the film hangs on finding that oft-mentioned tail. That story arc will test Kitais courage and Cyphers patience since the injury means he can bark out orders only by remote. Earth has many perils -- mainly its wild animal population and one Ursa that survived the crash -- dont ask. Jaden will be required to do a lot of major stunt work if Kitai is to survive.As Gen. Cypher Raige Smith has never seemed stiffer like Patton without the personality. Its as if his Ranger suit were two sizes too small and hes trying to just deal with it. Meanwhile Jaden struggles with the same issues as his character. He is trying so hard that the teenagers engaging on-screen presence the one that made ""The Karate Kid"" such a kick mostly disappears. Hes best when running jumping and fighting the beasties. Both dad and lad have a tough time with the deadly dialogue.If youre still wondering whether ""After Earth"" is a disaster the question is not if but how big? betsy.sharkeylatimes.com--------------------------------""After Earth""MPAA rating PG for sci-fi action violence and some disturbing imagesRunning time 1 hour 40 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Science Fiction (Movie Genre) Family Movies Entertainment After Earth (movie) Jaden Smith Will Smith Will Smiths After Earth Answers to six burning questions After Earth takes Will Smith back near his Philadelphia hometown Fast amp; Furious 6 to speed past After Earth at the box office Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad81deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-after-earth-review-20130531,0,5520934.story",200,afterearth13,afterearth,latimes

Comments click to enlarge After Earth Video Rated PG-13  100 minutes  2013 M. Night Shyamalan is one of the few Hollywood genre directors with a sense of pacing and physical space; with this big-budget sci-fi adventure he maintains suspense by revealing only gradually the full scope of the fantastic setting. A few thousand years after the earth has become uninhabitable a space commander and his son (Will Smith and his real-life son Jaden both wooden) crash-land on the dead planet and struggle to survive. Much of Wills dialogue consists of life lessons imparted to the boy and they sound like a motivational seminar. By Ben Sachs Official Site www.afterearth.com/siteDirector M.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Jaden Smith stars with father Will in ""After Earth"" which the family would be better off not discussing around the dinner table. (Claudette Barius/Columbia Pictures) By Michael OSullivan May 30 2013 Will Smith fans who have been eagerly awaiting their heros next rock em sock em action adventure will have to wait a little bit longer. Sequels to ""Hancock"" ""Bad Boys"" and ""I Robot"" will take up much of the actors time for the foreseeable future. In the meantime Smiths character in ""After Earth"" spends most of the new sci-fi flick flat on his back with two broken legs. Its an odd choice considering that many people who buy tickets to a Will Smith movie do so under the assumption that hell be able to you know walk. That choice is less odd when you consider that the story -- directed by M. Night Shyamalan from a script by Shyamalan and Gary Whitta (""The Book of Eli"") -- was conceived by Smith as a vehicle for his son Jaden. The 14-year-old Smith is the real hero of ""After Earth"" which is less a traditional summer blockbuster than a sentimental father-and-son melodrama tarted up with CGI monsters. Set in a post-apocalyptic future in which humans have evacuated a now uninhabitable Earth for a distant planet the movie is essentially a two-character set piece. When their spacecraft crash-lands on Earth General Cypher Raige (Smith senior) and his son Kitai (Smith junior) must navigate 100 kilometers of treacherous terrain filled with carnivorous beasts to locate the electronic distress beacon that will save them. The bad news is Dad was seriously injured in the crash and Kitai is a young impulsive and untested kid. The good news? Kitais form-fitting space suit -- which looks like steampunk long johns outfitted with a bicycle-seat-shaped backpack -- is made with high-tech ""smart fabric."" Equipped with sensors video camera and microphone Kitai sets out his every move monitored and dictated by the general an emotionally remote but controlling father if ever there was one. The presence of man-eating aliens notwithstanding its a tale of helicopter parenting on steroids. And its not an especially new interesting or even eye-catching one. The futuristic production design is blandly generic the special effects props and costumes cheap and slapdash-looking. One exception a scene in which Kitai dives off a cliff in a ""flying squirrel"" wing suit. Its pretty cool. Fortunately the movie gets a tiny bit better when Kitai accidentally loses the camera and microphone that tether him to his father. The sudden withdrawal of his electronic apron string forces the boy to get by on his own which makes for somewhat higher stakes. Unfortunately Jaden Smith does not have -- how shall I put this nicely? -- his fathers screen presence or charisma. Yet. Is it fair to expect an adolescent to not behave like one? Kitai spends much of the movie running around in a panic waving his little arms at predators and shouting ""Leave me alone"" Its appropriate to the character I guess. But its also more than mildly annoying. Kitai comes across as a whiny willful and one-dimensional brat. Once Cypher and Kitais communications go dead the elder Smith has precious little to do in the film other than attempt some self-surgery on one of his injured legs. While he waits Kitai forges on fending off attacks from a venomous snake a giant bird of prey and a pack of angry monkeys. All of them look obviously fake. The real threat however comes from a nasty alien critter that although blind has the ability to smell human fear pheromones. Kitais cool-as-a-cucumber father is famous for his fearlessness -- enabling him to effectively become invisible to the monsters. But Kitai has yet to learn this skill called ""ghosting."" (If only the kid had packed a can of Axe Body Spray.) But never mind all that. ""After Earth"" only looks like a sci-fi film. At heart its a tale of reconciliation between a callow boy and his jerk of an old man. Cypher knows how to boss Kitai around but he just doesnt know how to say ""I love you."" Shyamalan lays on the schmaltz thick and heavy practically begging for tears. You cant blame Will Smith for wanting to give his son a leg up in the business. Maybe one day Jaden will have his fathers career -- and his ability to carry a movie. For now its a little premature to ask him to bear the weight of this soggy waterlogged ""Earth"" on his skinny shoulders. r (100 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for some violence blood and gore. lifestyle style true Please provide a valid email address.

Were not just speaking of warrior-class father-son team Cypher and Kitai Raige (Will and Jaden Smith) the last survivors of a spaceship crash on a devastated human-abandoned future Earth. Were also talking about director M. Night Shyamalan whose name has been all but scrubbed from the marketing for this competent occasionally stirring science-fiction adventure. Its a long way down from ""the next Spielberg"" to yeoman hack. Fortunately the very real lows of The Last Airbender (2010) the Sixth Sense directors most previous foray into YA-fantasy territory are relegated to a hilariously nonsensical opening voiceover--something about environmental devastation mass exodus and ""ghosting."" Instead After Earth is primarily a fleet focused two-hander that sidelines Smith pere in a voice-of-God role while Smith fils runs jumps flies and avoids a beastie that resembles a living booger in his search for a come-save-us homing beacon. Shyamalan still has some of the suspense-ratcheting talent he displayed in heyday efforts like Signs (2002); Kitais against-the-clock attempt to inject himself with antivenom after hes bitten by a leechlike organism certainly gets the adrenaline flowing. What undoes the film is its rather rancid parent-child sentimentality (a Shyamalan staple admittedly) and a charisma-free performance from the younger Smith that suggests the apple has fallen very far from the tree indeed. At least the tacked-on narrative twist is a thing of the past. Making progress M. Night.

And thats just the first of its problems (COLUMBIA) Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 30 2013 at 704 AM updated May 30 2013 at 1030 AM comments For a long time Will Smith seems to have been taking career tips from his good pal Tom Cruise. Like TC Inc. he promotes his films relentlessly especially abroad. He throws out buzz-words in oddly intense interviews. He laughs and grins constantly helping to take the edge off an almost off-putting self-confidence and cold-eyed focus. But did that hero-worship mean he had to release his own awful apocalyptic sci-fi film this summer too? And one with an added control-your-mind perfect-yourself message (""Fear is a choice"") that seems to have been cribbed from an old copy of ""Dianetics""? Maybe not but just a little more than a month after Cruises ""Oblivion"" comes Smiths ""After Earth"" (which opens tonight) full of more ruined worlds white-on-white decor and impenetrable plot turns. And all it manages to accomplish is making Cruises stultifying film look epic by comparison. The story -- after squeezing a good hour of exposition into the first five minutes or so -- takes place in a future where a ravaged Earth has been abandoned and humans now live on a distant planet. It wasnt a hospitable place at first as they were hunted by ferocious predators blind but able to smell fear. Only a great soldier whod learned to control that emotion was able to help vanquish them. Years later hes taking his teen son on a little interstellar trip -- when their rocket crashes on old Earth severely injuring him and freeing one of those captive monsters. Now its all up to his kid. Uh-oh. Jaden Smith left and Will Smith are in trouble and sos After EarthCOLUMBIA Dad is played by Smith whos apparently decided that his hero has not only learned to sublimate fear but every other sort of feeling. He speaks in a cold stilted monotone. He feels practically nothing not even pain. (At one point he even calmly performs surgery -- on himself.) All of which may be an interesting choice for an actor but its an awful decision for a star. The biggest thing Will Smith ever had going for him was charm. Who wants to see him play a plastic action figure? Smiths son meanwhile is played by his real-life son Jaden -- which seems like a logical choice too. But its also a huge mistake because no matter how much Will and wife Jada Pinkett push their children at us theyre not stars. Jadens approach to his role is the exact opposite of his fathers -- and just as wrong. He overacts. He makes faces. He yells a lot. And unfortunately unlike Dad he speaks in a slurry mumble -- ""aw-duh"" for ""order"" ""cow-ud"" for ""coward"" -- that makes him sound like Elmer Fudd. You might think you can see the movies moral coming -- that being a true hero means doing your duty despite your fear that to turn yourself into a robot is to deny your own humanity. Except it actually believes Smiths character is right. Control everything. Thats how you succeed. This is a blockbuster only L. Ron Hubbard could love. The truly sad thing is this wouldnt be a bad story if you stripped away all the sci-fi flash and psychobabble. Put father and son on a little twin-engine plane crash it in Alaska turn that slavering alien into a hungry bear and youd have a tale Jack London would have been proud of. But instead director M. Night Shyamalan -- ah remember him? -- burdens everything with unnecessary flashbacks and awful CGI (the scale of things seem to change from shot to shot and the background landscapes look like cheap paintings). Its a cheap gift wrapped up in shiny paper and bound to benefit no ones career. Will Smiths least of all. Which I suppose is why ""Men in Black IV"" has already been announced. Ratings note The film contains violence. After Earth (PG-13) Columbia (100 min.) Directed by M. Night Shyamalan. With Will Smith Jaden Smith.

But even a thousand years from now equipment malfunctionsJaden Smith doesnt have much to say in After Earth.(Photo Claudette Barius Sony/Columbia Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review  out of fourStars Jaden Smith Will Smith Sophie OkonedoRated PG-13; Runtime 1 hour 40 minutes; Opens Friday nationwideThough its meant to be pulse-pounding After Earth is a lethargic slog.This is not particularly the fault of its stars Will Smith and his son Jaden though the latter could benefit from some acting lessons.Rather director M. Night Shyamalan seemingly puts more effort into production design and overbearing music than into dialogue or interplanetary action scenes. What remains is a floundering futuristic coming-of-age saga ( out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide).The films look is striking. A ship that father and son ride resembles a manta ray zooming through space. But their dialogue is mostly repetitive psycho-babble broken up by tedious silences.The story is set 1000 years from now. Kitai (Jaden) his aptly-named father Cypher (Will) and mother Faia (Sophie Okonedo) live on a planet called Nova Prime. Cypher brings Kitai along on a mission but their spaceship is struck by asteroids and crash-lands on Earth. Everyone aboard perishes except for father and son. Cypher suffers two broken legs so its up to Kitai to retrieve a beacon that landed miles away so they can signal for help. Catastrophic events on Earth rendered it uninhabitable for humans though it looks homey complete with roaming buffalo.VIDEO Will Smiths acting dynasty dreamsPREMIERE Smiths goof around on After Earth red carpetMORE The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYGUIDE USA TODAYs summer movie guideShyamalan makes an inexplicable and distracting choice when he has future humans speaking with an awkward dialect. It sounds vaguely mid-Atlantic and also approximates how Elmer Fudd might have spoken as a toddler. When Jaden first speaks its hard to tell if he has a slight speech impediment or if the mangled pronunciation is intentional.And what is spoken adds to the tedium. Cypher makes goofy guru-like pronouncements like ""Recognize your power. This will be your creation.""Given that the film was intended as an intergalactic adventure featuring vivid computer-generated animals an immersive 3-D environment might have induced more thrills. It would have intensified the sense of peril when Kitai leaps off a cliff and is dive-bombed by a cross between a hawk and a Dodo bird.Instead were left with an inert tale of a boy coming into his own. While Jaden was adorable at age 8 in The Pursuit of Happyness and was capable in the remake of The Karate Kid the now-14-year-old doesnt have the skills to pull off this starring role.His character spends a lot of time silent and alone hiking through unfamiliar terrain. A more powerful screen presence is needed for such a passive part.With the story credited to Will Smith After Earth is a pricey vanity project. It features only three action sequences -- Kitai being chased by baboons dodging the oversized bird and fighting a snarling alien. That leaves more than an hour where the audience must endure Cyphers terse orders and wan platitudes and Kitais vague reactions. For highly evolved beings these two specimens are surprisingly insipid. 225 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 33 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/19oreFkSummer Movies Calendar JuneTake a look at the films heading to the box office this June complete with trailers reviews clips related stories and more.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> After Earth merits comparison with 2000s Battlefield Earth John Travoltas godawful film tribute to the sci-fi novel by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. Yes its that bad. This time poor ravaged Earth uninhabitable by humans is occupied by predatory birds monkeys and tacky computer-generated aliens. So what are Will Smith 44 and his son Jaden Smith 14 doing there? Ask Big Willie he dreamed up the story. What we see on screen with a sodden script co-written by Gary Whitta and director M. Night Shyamalan (a galaxy away from the glory days of The Sixth Sense Unbreakable and Signs) is an unholy mess of platitudes and posturing that makes 90 minutes drag on like a life sentence. Daddy Smith plays Cypher the militarist leader of Nova Prime the planet where humans live after they destroyed natures balance 1000 years ago. Cypher is one stoic thin-lipped dude. No wonder his son Kitai Raige (Jaden Smith) cant get close to him. Kitai cant even cut it in the United Ranger Corps where his father is considered a God. OK hes a general but you take my point. What can bring father and son together? A disaster of course. When a spaceship crash strands Cypher and Kita on Earth the boy must become a man. Cue the cliches. Cypher breaks both his legs. This means he sits around staring at computer screens while sonny boy does the heavy lifting running a 60-mile obstacle course to another part of the ships wreckage to recover a beacon that will save the day and both their lives. If youre thinking this movie wont be going where you think its going snap out of it. So what we have here is a Will Smith devoid of humor charm and screen time waiting in the car while his kid does the driving. Whaat? The young Smith has energy but not the acting chops. And hes no miracle worker. The burden of carrying this dull lifeless movie is just too much. And its hell on an audience. Its not a good sign when you sit there thinking - Make. It. Stop.

"After Earth a family trip to nowhere review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesAfter Earth a family trip to nowhere reviewThe Will Smith family vanity project After Earth is so staggeringly ill-conceived you almost have to admire the moxie of all involved.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. May 30 2013After EarthStarring Will Smith and Jaden Smith. Directed by M. Night Shyamalan. 100 minutes. Opens May 31 at major theatres. PGAfter Earth is so staggeringly ill-conceived you almost have to admire the moxie of all involved with it.First you have a major studio (Sony) rolling the dice on a summer sci-fi blockbuster by an auteur director (M. Night Shyamalan) whose previous attempts at popcorn thrills (The Last Airbender The Happening) were greeted with raspberries.Article Continued BelowThen you take your marquee star (Will Smith) add 10 pounds and remove any trace of charisma while benching him for most of the movie. The burden of the picture falls upon the stars 14-year-old son (Jaden Smith) who is simply not up to the task of emoting within a CGI-heavy environment.Add to this misguided literary pretensions through constant bizarre references to Herman Melvilles Moby Dick a novel of adult obsession and revenge that has little connection with the Boys Own Adventure in which the film steadily devolves.If youre going to fail you might as well fail big. The result is a movie that should have been called Death Wish had that title not already been nabbed long ago. And the only value in watching it is to see an expensive disaster slowly unfold.The time is some 1000 years in the future after negligent Earthlings have turned their planet from a paradise into a garbage dump. Regular humans have been evacuated to a new planet Nova Prime while the bravest and strongest of them work as Rangers intergalactic policemen who tangle with bug-like alien monsters called Ursas (shades of Starship Troopers) who constantly threaten Earthlings just for the hell of it.The bravest and strongest of the Rangers is Cypher Raige (Will Smith) who has learned how to defeat Ursas by suppressing his fear which the beasts can smell. This skill is called ""ghosting"" and its just one of the things Raiges son Kitai (Jaden Smith) aspires to do on that happy day when he becomes a Ranger himself. But as the story begins Kitai is told by a Ranger chief that hes ""not ready"" for prime time because he has a tendency to fade in the field -- a comment that also serves as criticism of Jadens underachieving acting.Daddy Raige small on emotion but big on bromides (""Danger is very real but fear is a choice"") decides the thing to do is to bring brooding Kitai along on a patrol. And when their spaceship crashes on a planet very much like Earth (twist alert) sans humans its suddenly up to Kitai to save the day. Cypher breaks both legs in the crash obliging him to remain in the ship (which resembles the interior of a whale). He Skypes commands to Kitai while the lad embarks upon a 100-kilometre jungle trek to recover a lost homing beacon that may save them. The beacon was in the tail of the ruined spaceship which also contained an imprisoned Ursa.Were advised that this hostile land freezes solid each and every night but this doesnt seem to affect the flourishing greenery flowing rivers and waterfalls that Kitai must traverse. Nor does it stop the baboons birds of prey carnivorous animals and other subpar CGI creations that Kitai must fight when hes not falling into a coma as he regularly does.Details schmetails. They obviously didnt concern Will Smith who wrote the story that Shyamalan and Gary Whitta (The Book of Eli) have awkwardly adapted for the screen. Will and his wife Jada Pinkett Smith Jadens mom also have production credits on After Earth. The family connections give the strong aroma of a vanity project designed to bolster Jadens dubious acting career which his inert performance in The Karate Kid remake should have already settled.The parental interest is admirable especially Wills thoughtful decision to downshift his own acting so as not to upstage his son. Will hasnt been this immobile since he was poisoned by a jellyfish in the calamity called Seven Pounds.Yet we all know what road is paved with good intentions and its not the one leading to multiplexes showing After Earth.

Hundreds of years from now after humankind has fled a despoiled Earth and resettled in another galaxy where folks live in sleek high-rises with all the latest accoutrements and where they have holographic PDAs that fold up like origami an amputee has to hop around without the aid of an artificial limb or even a pair of crutches? Slideshow After Earth Smith and son fight to survive intergalactic crash Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about After Earth >> Its a small matter in the grand scheme of After Earth Will Smith and M. Night Shyamalans sci-fi yarn about a young mans personal Outward Bound experience trekking across a postapocalyptic planet but it points to the cheesy melodrama at work. When early on in this father-and-son vehicle a grateful veteran approaches Gen. Cypher Raige (Smith) to thank him for saving his life in the thick of battle he insists on standing tall and saluting shrugging off the help of two colleagues. So what if the soldier literally doesnt have a leg to stand on? We now know that the General is courageous and caring and worthy of our attention for the next hour and a half. And in truth despite more corn than Mel Gibson grows on his farm in Signs (another Shyamalan effort) After Earth is worth a look. With a production design that mixes futuro-tech with a hippie Pier 1 aesthetic this beautifully shot tale finds the superstar from Overbrook in a supporting or at least mentoring role turning the action over to his son Jaden a rangy brooder of a boy. The younger Smith plays Kitai a fiercely intelligent teen determined to impress his dad - a dad who spends most of his time on extended tours of duty busy fighting Ursas - giant alien beasts whose raison detre is to stalk and kill humans. They can smell fear - or the pheromones produced by scaredy-pants guys and gals - and gnash and gnaw thats it. But if you can face the Ursa without apprehension or dread - as Gen. Raige can - they are conquerable. Unfortunately when father and son Raiges crash-land back on Earth the spaceship theyve been riding - seriously dinged in an asteroid storm - is carrying an Ursa too. Also somewhat unfortunate is the fact that the General has broken both of his legs (""one very badly"" he notes) and that the SOS beacon in their wreckage has been damaged beyond use. To get the folks back on Nova Prime to come to the rescue Kitai must slog across 100 kilometers of Edenic but inhospitable Earth and retrieve the other beacon in the ships tail section. Not to worry Kitai has a Navi Band a digital hookup wrapped to his forearm that allows Dad to see what he sees herds of buffalo flocks of birds and uh-oh a congress of killer baboons. It also allows Dad to impart important messages along the lines of ""fear is not real"" and other samurai-like koans. You half expect the General to say ""feel the Force Luke"" but that would be another movie. Based on a story by Smith with a screenplay credited to Shyamalan and Gary Whitta (The Book of Eli - and this one has biblical aspects too) After Earth is refreshing in that its not rife with fast-cuts whooshing camera shots and overblown visual effects. The Ursa and the baboons a pack of predatory feline beasts and a giant condorlike bird are all rendered in expert CGI seamlessly embedded in the action. And speaking of action the elder Smith is anything but a superhero here. Crumpled in his command module he addresses his kid or himself. The takes are long and unhurried and if the words are sometimes ponderous hey its nice to not feel rushed for a change. Just get that other guy a prosthetic.

Courtesy of Columbia Pictures. After Earth Director M. Night Shyamalan Genre Sci-fi Adventure Running Time 100 minutes Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action violence and some disturbing images With Will Smith Jaden Smith A disastrous father-son endeavor about a calamitous father-son expedition After Earth doesnt play to the strengths of any of its major participants. Will Smith portrays a stern outer space hero devoid of the bantering wit and easygoing demeanor of his trademark roles. Director M. Night Shyamalan auteur of twisty The Sixth Sense struggles with a surprise-free plot and a trial-by-fire moral so earnest it suggests a circa-1944 World War II flick. And Jaden Smith in the movies tissue-thin principal role is called on to act. Hell start losing viewers with his wooden opening narration. Set 1000 years in the future the story begins long after humans have fled an environmentally trashed Earth. Their new home is hardly congenial being populated by people-eating Ursa -- creatures that arent a form of bear; theyre the usual space-monster hybrid of squid cockroach and pit bull. The Ursa are blind but they can smell human dread. So the only people who can best then are those who are literally fearless like Gen. Cypher Raige (the elder Smith). While he travels the universe stoically doing brave stuff his son Kitai (the younger Smith) is at Ranger Corps school trying to become just like dreary old Dad. As is characteristic of aspiring cinematic Top Guns Kitai is academically brilliant and physically unsurpassed. But hes hobbled by terror that stems from a childhood incident and recurs -- again and again and then again -- in motivating flashbacks. Monkey See Summer Movie Preview Kids Theft The Apocalypse And Joss Whedon Steely dad and marshmallowy son get themselves in trouble while on the old mans One Last Mission. Theyre flying somewhere on a space cruiser that absurdly carries a captive Ursa. Slammed by an asteroid storm the ship crashes on a ""class 1 quarantine planet."" (That would be Earth.) The only survivors are Cypher Kitai and the Ursa. Dad busts both legs in the wreck so its up to Kitai to retrieve the beacon that will summon the interstellar AAA to come give them a tow. ""Everything on this planet has evolved to kill humans"" cautions Cypher a warning that turns out not to be true. Kitai tangles with mutant baboons and tigers but he also gets aid from one of the supposedly homicidal critters. The assistance is a sentimental moment that boosts the movies cursory ecological message which also involves Moby-Dick and a cameo by some whales. They might have swum out of Star Trek IV The Voyage Home the most humpback-friendly installment in that series. More On M. Night Shyamalan Movies Airbender A Kid Flick With Little To Lure Parents M. Night Shyamalan The Art of the Creepy Movie Movies The Happening Something Wicked in the Wind? Its obvious that the movies major CGI threat will be not peeved Earth fauna but that escaped Ursa. Kitai must eventually face the beast armed only with a high-tech cutlass encouraging words from a dead relative and the kind of pure-heartedness you learn from starring in a Karate Kid remake. After Earths essential ingredients are its Point A-to-Point B scenario merely adequate special effects and utter humorlessness. A few wisecracks might have distracted from the films grim banality but Smith apparently nixed that. The former sitcom star conceived the movies story and is one of the producers who also include his wife and brother-in-law. Shyamalan whose directorial decline has been precipitous doesnt exactly energize the script for which he shares on-screen credit with The Book of Elis Gary Whitta. (Reportedly several other script doctors tried to revive the patient.) Ultimately the movie takes another cue from old-timey war pictures and salutes itself. It no more earns that honor however than Will Smith deserves a Purple Heart for pretending to have broken his legs.

Photo Credit Columbia Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT On a routine mission an interstellar soldier and his son crash-land on an abandoned Earth. Rated PG-13 BOTTOM LINE A lifeless wreck of a movie from writer-director M. Night Shyamalan who creates a post-apocalyptic planet on which nothing including talented actors and his own storytelling abilities can survive. CAST Will Smith Jaden Smith Zoe Isabella Kravitz LENGTH 140 Will Smith and his son Jaden Smith play interstellar versions of themselves in ""After Earth"" a post-apocalyptic adventure film from writer-director M. Night Shyamalan. ""Id heard stories of Earth"" says Jaden playing a young space-ranger. ""A paradise until we destroyed it."" ""After Earth"" could have been a paradise for summer moviegoers. The elder Smith is one of the most appealing movie stars in the universe while Jaden (2010s ""The Karate Kid"") is growing into a tall lanky handsome teen. They play a cold military father Cypher Raige and his sensitive son Kitai who crash-land on an abandoned Earth dominated by super-evolved wildlife. So far so OK at least. So why does ""After Earth"" feel like the opposite of entertainment? Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless Comedy Central upset over use of fake Colbert? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Messing Shelton call truce after spat over Trump Matt Damon says hes taking a year-long acting break Shyamalans narrative skills have devolved from the near-genius of ""The Sixth Sense"" to the flailing mess of 2010s ""The Last Airbender"" and they havent improved. (Will Smith is credited with the story.) You can almost see Shyamalans eyes darting around as he makes stuff up. Cypher is stuck in the wrecked ship so Kitai must go find the distress beacon. But dont forget to ingest your air purifiers Oh no the Earth is freezing Argh a giant eagle Flashbacks with Zoe Isabella Kravitz as the sister Kitai lost to some kind of alien aim to build toward an emotional climax but only confuse matters. ""After Earth"" isnt just chaotic and desperate -- and grindingly slow -- its also lazy. The futuristic United Ranger Corps is still sporting high-and-tight haircuts and snapping salutes while the spaceships are the usual jumble of holographic displays. As for Earths hyper-advanced baboons and tigers -- essentially Jadens supporting cast -- theyre vaguely rendered and without personality. Someone on this film must also answer for creating one of the worst future-accents in sci-fi history. Reaching for regal Brit-speak but falling nearer to a Kentucky drawl it renders the dialogue unintelligible or accidentally hilarious. ""Inject yo self di-rectly into yo haht"" Cypher commands his poisoned son. The younger Smith fares worse since many of his lines consist of two words ""Yes suh."" 228 MoviesAfter Earth trailer With Will Smith barely on screen Jaden must carry ""After Earth"" by himself but its an impossible task. Its a massive disintegrating planet of a movie that nobody could survive. advertisement | advertise on newsday PLOT On a routine mission an interstellar soldier and his son crash-land on an abandoned Earth.

"After Earth 2 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article After Earth 2 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED INFO After Earth Bad 2 stars Director M. Night Shyamalan.Cast Will Smith Jaden Smith Sophie Okonedo.Rating PG-13 for sci-fi action and some disturbing images. By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Fri May 31 2013 417 PM It must be something to be Will Smiths son. Most of our children when school resumes in the fall will write essays about what they did this summer went to the beach visited cousins made the Little League all-star team spent time at Disneyland. And then theres Jaden Smith. ""Dad put me in another movie. It was cool."" Except not really. Some of ""After Earth"" is intriguing if you ignore the premise and the story and the direction and much of Jaden Smiths performance. Other than that. ... M. Night Shyamalan co-wrote the screenplay and directs the film word of which has come to signal more alarm than excitement these days. (The story is by Will Smith.) ""After Earth"" is not a disaster of ""Last Airbender"" proportions but its nowhere near the quality of a film such as ""The Sixth Sense."" The film is set in the future when mankind has selfishly ruined Earth which is what mankind tends to do in science-fiction films. (Credit never is given for inventing Wi-Fi or the turducken.) Humans live elsewhere which is pleasant enough except that aliens have created these big ugly monsters to chase humans down and kill them. The only weakness these monsters have is that they are blind. Which seems unlikely. Youre smart enough to invent a freaky monster but you cant give him sight? Anyway the way the creatures find you is to sense your fear. If you dont exude fear they cant find you. (It honestly doesnt sound that stupid when you see it played out. Or maybe it does.) The way to survive is to not be afraid and no one is less afraid than Gen. Cypher Raige (Will Smith). Hes a stone-cold stud wandering about fearlessly killing the monsters by just walking up to them and slicing them open. But like many working fathers hes away a lot. His son Kitai (Jaden Smith) longs to be a ranger in the armed forces Raige leads but hes not quite ready. Instead the general takes the boy on a routine mission as a kind of bonding exercise. Uh-oh. Theres trouble along the way and the two wind up on a deserted planet not fit for human habitation. On board their ship naturally is one of the monsters who was going to be used in a ranger-training exercise. Then the story hobbles Raige literally. He is incapacitated and must send Kitai out into the dangerous world theyve landed on to find a distress-signal beacon. And remember dont be afraid Because itll get you killed Bye Theres more to it than that but not a lot. What transpires is utterly predictable a rote exercise in summer-blockbuster action. Which is not by itself a fatal flaw. The real problem is this Its more interesting to watch Will Smith sit in a chair and give orders to his son than it is to watch his son carry them out even if they involve fighting off hungry futuristic creatures. The jolts are of the jump-out-from-behind-the-door variety; you can see them coming from a long way off too. Shyamalan seems to no longer have the confidence to let audiences figure things out or the patience to allow them to. This could have been a thoughtful movie about conquering fear as Kitai has some tragedy in his past he needs to work out but instead its watch out for that giant bird Thatll be 9 thanks. Enjoy your show. Will Smith is an outstanding actor but seems to be in that class of famous people who havent heard the word ""no"" in the past 20 years. Supposedly he turned down the role Jamie Foxx played in ""Django Unchained."" Heres a suggestion If an opportunity like that comes along again take it. Send your kid to summer camp.

The lead role in a 130-million sci-fi epic that never soars. By Richard Corliss May 30 2013 Share Read Later Send to Kindle Frank Masi / Columbia Pictures Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Why does the future in some sci-fi films have to be so damned dystopian? Granted life is a vale of tears a myopic eyeblink between the cradle and the grave while grim death gargles at you from every corner. But movies should squeeze a little juice out of this pulp find verve and fun in our limping race to elude mortality. The bleak anodyne tone of futurist movies is especially disappointing when their stars are guys who made their reps decades ago as blithe charmers with mile-wide grins -- Tom Cruise in the recent Oblivion or Will Smith in this weekends example of mopey dystopia After Earth. The onetime Top Gun cant crack that larkish smile; the erstwhile Fresh Prince has gone stern and stale. In just his second picture (following Men in  Black 3) since 2008 Smith teams with fellow Philadelphian M. Night Shyamalan who hasnt made a terrific movie since The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable back in the last millennium. This time Shyamalan is working from a story by Smith and a script by Gary Whitta whose The Book of Eli managed to put the top-spin in dystopia. No such luck here. Running or stumbling only 90 minutes (plus about 10 mins. of end credits) After Earth may lack the neck-swiveling awfulness of Shyamalans The Last Airbender but it quickly sinks in its logorrheic solemnity. The movie makes Oblivion seem as jolly a romp as Spaceballs and gives neither Shyamalan nor Smith much to smile about. (READ Corlisss review of M. Night Shyamalans The Last Airbender) Smith plays a superstud space commander a thousand years from now when Earthlings have decamped to the distant planet Nova Prime. Like the solitary man he played in the 2007 I Am Legend which was set in the near future (2012) that is now the past Smith is a natural warrior with supreme survival skills. Here his gift is ""ghosting"" -- overcoming his fear to make him undetectable to a species of blind monster known as Ursa. (READ Corlisss review of the Will Smith I Am Legend) Our hero also has a problem hes called Cypher which in its alternate spelling of Cipher means either cryptographic code or arithmetical zero. Second problem His character lives down to his name. He speaks like the stodgiest computer noting that ""Gravitime buildup could be a precursor to mall expansion"" (or something like that). HAL 9000 had way more human inflection than this grim professional soldier. A workaholic whos too busy saving the universe to spend much time with his family -- or to have saved his daughter (Zoe Isabelle Kravitz) from being hacked to pieces by an Ursa -- Cypher returns to Nova Prime to find that his rebellious underachieving son Kitai (Smiths own 14-year-old child Jaden) has flunked his entrance exam for Ranger Academy. Cyphers wife Faia (Sophie Okonedo) the only sensitive human left in the clan tells him what Shyamalan has already been pounding home that Kitai ""doesnt need a commanding officer. He needs a father."" Time for some serious daddy-son bonding. (SEE Steven James Snyders Top Five Underrated Sci-Fi Masterpieces) Cypher obliges Faia in the letter though in not the spirit of her plea -- he still barks out orders like ""Evaluate Consolidate"" -- by taking Kitai on a routine mission of transporting a caged Ursa to some distant outpost. The ship crashes on Earth the Ursa escapes the rest of the crew is killed and Cyphers legs are broken rendering him immobile. Kitai must go on a three-day wilderness adventure to locate the tail of the ship which contains communication devices while Cypher monitors the lads progress and perils via 31st-century Skype from his sickbed. The rest of the movie is Kitais tribal rite of passage -- a one-boy Hunger Games woodlore ordeal supervised by his dad the Great Santini. (READ Corlisss review of The Hunger Games) On this summer camp from Hell Kitai stumbles into the Lascaux caves skirts a nearby volcano (how the topography of France has changed in a thousand years) uses his cape to take Avatar flying lessons and huddles in a ""hot spot"" to keep warm in the freezing night (though the planets lavish flora has apparently developed immunities to cold). He encounters baboons lions bison herds and birds the size of a Dreamliner. And of course the Ursa. Whats missing are the humans who often show up in futurist sci-fi films set on Earth (e.g. Oblivion and I Am Legend). That must be because the planet is filled with creatures that as Cypher warns Kitai ""have evolved to kill humans"" -- and they killed all of them? All right then no humans. And no sad adorable robots; a visit from WALLE would have cued a welcome respite from the emotional aridity. (READ Corlisss review of WALLE) That leaves two appealing actors stranded in the busted hull of this underpopulated unfeeling effort. If Will Smith wants to play grumpy alpha-males instead of exuding some old his old easy charisma thats his privilege. Well just keep hoping that the Fresh Prince wakes up and gets a revivifying dose of Jazzy Jeff. But Jaden -- a sweet sensation with his father in the 2006 The Pursuit of Happyness and three summers ago with Jackie Chan in The Karate Kid -- shouldnt be forced into a balky character just because hes entered his terrible teens. His notes of fear and anger are marked by the primitive fret lines and taut lips that animators draw onto the faces of Bart Simpson and Stan Marsh. And a brief note to Jadens parents and teachers (who are also his parents since they home-schooled the boy and cofounded the New Village Leadership Academy that he occasionally attends) the young mans enunciation is muddy which virtually requires English subtitles for Kitais voiceover narration. (READ TIMEs appreciation of Jaden Smith in The Karate Kid) The movie ought at least to look great; it was lensed by old-master cinematographer Peter Suschitzky who has shot 10 David Cronenberg films plus The Empire Strikes Back. But After Earth doesnt create the startlingly new vistas that Avatar taught viewers to look for. Back in 2006 when other directors had embraced the digital format Shyamalan was one of the last to champion old-fashioned film. ""Digital is just too smooth"" he said then. ""You almost have to degrade the image to make it more real."" After Earth shot on Sonys F65 CineAlta digital system looks consistently unreal. Its pasteurized visuals are less persuasive and distinctive than the matte paintings that Albert Whitlock devised for The Birds Diamonds Are Forever and Earthquake. State-of-the-art the new movies technology may be but offering little innovative cinematic art. (READ M. Night Shyamalan and George Lucas on the future of movies) Will Smith may have thought that this 130-million picture would be the most loving extravagant present a rich man could give his son the launch of a film franchise that would keep Jaden busy through high school and beyond. (The Internet Movie Database lists a 2015 sequel After Earth 2.) But the first episode is so lifeless eventless humorless virtually movieless that its chances of resuscitation are slim. As Cypher warns Kitai ""This mission has reach Abort Criteria."" Actually in Critics Academy we are taught never to end a review with a sarcastic quote from the film under consideration; the tactic is just too easy and cheesy. Yet here the temptation proves irresistible. So heres one more. After some mini-castastrophe Kitai mutters ""That sucked."" Radios his dad ""Correct Cadet.""

(AP Photo/Sony Columbia Pictures) After Earth After Earth is a bad dream By Joe Williams / film critic / joewilliamspost-dispatch.com Joe Williams May 30 2013 (...) The Associated Press Will Smith left and Jaden Smith in a scene from ""After Earth."" (AP Photo/Sony Columbia Pictures) While youre sipping your morning coffee and reading the news about ""After Earth"" studio executives on several continents are in a panic. They knew it was risky to let M. Night Shyamalan rise from the wreckage of ""The Last Airbender."" They watched the woeful footage of his new movie and hoped they could salvage this summer release in the editing room.Then preview audiences got a whiff of it and the first reviews rolled in. Now job-imperiled publicists are begging Will Smith to smile for the cameras and lift the project with his personal magnetism.Maybe someone should have thought of that sooner. In this sci-fi fiasco the rapper-turned-actor who once reigned as the worlds biggest movie star doesnt crack any jokes or jaws. He spends most the movie incapacitated leaving the lame action sequences to his dramatically challenged son Jaden.The younger Smith plays Kitai Raige an army cadet descended from earthlings who fled their ecologically devastated planet 1000 years earlier. After a millennium on a rock called Nova Prime the humans dress like extras in a cheap ""Star Trek"" episode and talk like Elmer Fudd. Kitais father the aptly named Cypher is a no-nonsense general in the army who allows his son to tag along on an interplanetary training mission. The teaching tool locked in the cargo compartment is an alien lifeform that can smell human fear. Inexplicably the ship crash-lands on Earth where the crew is killed the alien is unleashed and the general suffers two broken legs. To send for help the cowardly cadet must hike the yellow brick road across 100 kilometers of not-very-scenic wilderness to reach a jettisoned homing device. As Kitai evades zoo-animal species that somehow survived the global apocalypse Cypher communicates step-by-step directions and fortune-cookie messages about character development. Thats more than we can say about Shyamalan whose grasp of film fundamentals is so tenuous that this hot-air balloon gets blown into the rarefied air of the worst movies ever made. The director of ""The Sixth Sense"" used to be known for his surprise endings but the only twist that could explain this mind-numbing nonsense is if we awakened to discover wed been imprisoned in pods and subjected to a sequel called ""After Battlefield Earth"" by L.

Night Shyamalan is branching out coming up with new ways to make bad movies. His plan must be to exhaust all possibilities so as to eventually come full circle and make a good one by accident. That fine day is still about 30 years off so in the meantime we must amuse ourselves with ""After Earth"" which takes place 1000 years after the planet was completely evacuated. What could make people evacuate the planet? No it wasnt that all the theaters started playing nothing but Shyamalan movies. It was far worse than that -- environmental stuff poisoning the planet floods people getting tired of watching Obama and Christie tour the wreckage together etc. So a human colony was established many miles away on a planet that looks like Arizona. On this planet Will Smith plays a great general renowned for his ability to repress all fear -- of monsters space shipwrecks even bad sci fi. A Will Smith who fears nothing is a noble thing to play but in dramatic terms its dull and robs the actor of opportunities to express emotion. But then the film -- based on a story by Smith -- was not created as a showcase for himself but for his 15-year-old son Jaden Smith who is on screen continuously. This is Jadens film and although a summer action blockbuster is indeed an impressive and expensive present to give ones child its a little like giving a Ferrari to an 8-year-old Hes not ready to drive the thing and letting him try is not good for him nor for anyone else in the vicinity. The story is quite simple and the dramatic action is the same thing over and over with little variation. The general and his son crash land on Earth and they need to send a flare into outer space. Unfortunately the only flare that works is in the tail of the plane -- 100 kilometers away -- and oh no both the generals legs are broken. So its entirely up to the young man to travel 100-kilometers on foot through the poisoned air fighting off creatures that have spent thousands of years evolving in ways uncongenial to human life. The birds for example are the size of pterodactyls and theyre nasty. But nastiest of all is the Ursa an agile horned and multi-fanged creature that cant see but it can smell when youre afraid. This metaphor -- excuse me monster -- will kill all those who fear it but it can be conquered by those who dont. And just between us do you think in the end the boy will master his fear? Wild guess? Id give you the answer but then youd lose the fun of waiting 100 whole minutes to find out. Along the way we get one or two big emotional moments that we can easily identify by listening closely to the sound track. And thats all we get in ""After Earth"" We have a character we dont care about played by an actor of no inherent screen presence fighting off computer-generated monsters. And we have Will Smith checking in occasionally by monitoring the action from a seated position in front of a computer console. He doesnt change expression as he watches the young mans exploits and neither does the audience. M. Night Shyamalan co-wrote the script which must have run upwards of 20 pages based on Smiths story. It boggles the mind and yet well probably never know how little was there to begin with.GO AFTER EARTH Featuring Jaden Smith Will Smith Zoe Kravitz directed by M.

(Frank Masi SMPSP) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Thursday May 30 2013 1201 AM Title After Earth Film Info With Will Smith Jaden Smith A thousand years in the future a space ranger and his son try to survive after a crash. Director M. Night Shyamalan. (143) PG-13 Violence. Area theaters. Summer 2013 has its first bomb and sadly its landed right on Will Smith. ""After Earth"" the latest Hollywood blockbuster pitting man against messed-up future (it follows ""Oblivion"" and arrives ahead of ""World War Z"" and ""Elysium"") is an interminable entry in the pop-apocalyptic genre. Smith previously rode that horse to glory in ""Independence Day"" ""I Robot"" and ""I Am Legend."" Here he mostly sits on the sidelines so his son Jaden can rise. The elder Smith plays Cypher Raige a famous interstellar ranger based on a planet called Nova Prime 1000 years after humans abandoned our home planet (a quick montage of disasters supposedly cover that). Raiges son Kitai played by Smith the younger is a ranger cadet who excels in the classroom but fails in the field. One reason is that hes crippled by fear after seeing his sister (Zoe Kravitz in a brief cameo) killed by a nasty alien giant-beast. Raige is told by his wife (Sophie Okonedo) to spend more time with Kitai so he brings the boy on a mission. But then the dullest asteroid run-in ever smashes their spaceship forcing a landing on Earth. Raige has two broken legs so its up to Kitai to venture outside with his father monitoring him past creatures ""that have evolved to kill humans"" to find a homing beacon with enough bars to flag a rescue ship. The pairing of Smith amp; Smith may have a media-pleasing passing-the-torch symmetry -- Will is 44 Jaden is 14 and they earlier starred together in the terrific 2006 drama ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" -- but director M. Night Shyamalan drains the spark from both their performances. Wills natural charm is lost in space; in its place is a stern distant-father manner that makes him as warm as an android (thats not a spoiler sadly). Jaden meanwhile has been directed to convey fear an emotion that is the movies true ""villain"" by jerking his head to and fro and crinkling his brow. Its not Jadens fault his voice is still a few octaves too high for an action star but it doesnt do him any favors when his character is lifted to the nest of a giant eagle that decides to mother him. That and everything else in Shyamalan and Gary Whittas script is woefully underrealized. (The production design too is a bore with ravaged Earth looking like a Hawaiian back lot.) Lurking in every corner of ""After Earth"" are poky action scenes sketchy plot details lazy logistics junky sci-fi mumbo jumbo and dull-as-rice attacks by futuristic baboons. Even the movies alien antagonists are similar to those in a dozen other movies. Shyamalan lauded for ""The Sixth Sense"" and underappreciated for ""Unbreakable"" went on to make the ugh-when-will-they-end? thrillers ""The Village"" ""Lady in the Water"" and ""The Happening."" (His kids actioner ""The Last Airbender"" was no picnic either.) ""After Earth"" suffers from the same sleepwalking style. The new films forced attempt at significance is when Raige tries to teach his son about ""ghosting"" -- that is to be so without fear ""you become invisible."" Yet the films most lasting image may be of Will Smith sitting in a command chair wounded and dozing muttering ""Run. Run away."" jneumaiernydailynews.com Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" throughout the day Thurs. - Sunday on New Yorks WOR 710-AM. On mobile?

May 30 2013 -- 1114am Video (4827)  In a sci-fi survival story Will Smith and son Jaden Smith portray a space General and his callow son who crash land on a savage earth a thousand years after it has been deserted by humanity. David Brewster Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert Not long from now Netflix will catalog the mind-alteringly awful ""After Earth"" starring Jaden Smith and Will Smith in its Science Fiction section. A more accurate category would be Nepotism a peculiar brand of make-believe where influential Hollywood parents present their offspring as stars in their own right without the heavy burden of developing talent or public appeal. The movie will find a fitting grave alongside 2005s ""Hostage"" starring Bruce Willis as a cop and Rumer Willis as his abducted daughter and the collected works of Tori Spelling. ""After Earth"" is a work of hubris magnified by multiple miscalculations the kind of film that would cause Ed Wood to excuse himself and skulk to the exit. Smith senior plays Gen. Cypher Raige the stoic military leader of an off-planet Earthling colony. I am not making this up that is seriously his name. His main task is killing giant bugs our alien enemies have dropped onto our settlement. The ugly beasts are blind locating human prey by the smell of our fear-triggered pheromones. Yes these are monsters that could be neutralized with a squirt of Axe body spray. Nobody in the future has thought of that. Gen. Raige kills the space roaches with a two-bladed spear (a gun would seem a better choice but remember these guys havent figured out deodorant). His technique is to be so zen cool that the creatures cant sniff him. A glowering humorless disciplinarian (a role Laurence Fishburne could have played much better) Gen. Raige acts like an android with a defective empathy chip. His conversation at the family dinner table sounds like snippets from ""The Art of War."" There are some issues between father and son to put it mildly. Young Kitai (Smith junior) a military cadet at that gawky all-knees-and-elbows age fears he cant measure up to Dads standards. Its like the vibe between Melissa and Joan Rivers on the Oscars red carpet but in space. Thanks to lazy screenwriting the pair crash-land on Earth 1000 years after the human exodus. Paralyzed Gen. Raige sends Kitai overland to locate the lost SOS transmitter. ""Everything on this planet has evolved to kill humans"" he warns. Which is a stupid evolutionary strategy with no humans around. Sony - Columbia Pictures In addition to bad writing and sci-fi cliches Will Smiths ""After Earth"" attempts to push his son Jaden above into the limelight before hes ready for prime time. In a bewildering procession of nonsequiturs buffalo coexist with orangutans and cobras hyenas have learned to climb trees tropical bromiliads thrive in wintry redwood forests and river leeches have developed fast-acting venom. All in just 1000 years. Also condors have learned dolphin-like compassion saving Kitai from certain death more than once. So Gen. Raige was wrong on that count. The storys details make no sense at all. A lava-belching volcano contains a refreshing swimming pool. A random cavern features caveman drawings. The Raiges spaceship whose interior is modeled after an intestine is transporting a giant bug egg for reasons I cant explain because I am not fluent in stupid. The films broad strokes are painfully trite. The acting is wooden the dialogue inane and M. Night Shyamalans directing choices are a lesson in sci-fi cliche. Even such surefire thrill-ride effects as Kitai leaping off a giant waterfall go inert through stumblebum editing. The only positive effect of ""After Earth"" is that it has improved the reputation of ""The Wild Wild West"" previously the worst movie of Smiths career. Colin Covert has covered films for the Star Tribune for 20 years interviewing Peter Jackson Kate Winslet Steven Spielberg Cate Blanchett Quentin Tarantino Neil Gaiman and John Travolta to name a few. Colins job as a film critic consists mostly of thinking up synonyms for ""mediocre."" He still gets a thrill when the lights dim and all too often a bigger thrill when they come on again.

Incredibly with these bold strokes ""After Earth"" announces it will be terrible right from the outset and woe be upon the person who holds out hope that it will get better after the initial wobbly start. It will not get better it will only get worse until youre actively cheering for a teenage kid to get eaten by a tiger (and wanting the tiger to savor every bite). I didnt plan to feel this way and no one could have predicted the best possible outcome for the film would be the brutal murder of a character one of the Smithlettes was portraying but you did this to me ""After Earth"". You made me root against the good guy mostly because you made him so incompetent so repugnant so unlikable that you rendered his journey and story arc meaningless. For when is a hero not a hero? When he acts worse than your average guy off the street. ""After Earth"" stupefies us with nonsense such little thought and logic went into this idea that it cant even be considered a rough draft this is a movie almost daring an audience to emotionally detach throughout. For shame To explain the threadbare plot shouldnt take particularly long even though the 100-minute running time of ""After Earth"" lasts around six years. Will Smith as the delightfully named Cypher Raige is a general in a futuristic army. Hes human a descendant of Earthlings forced to flee the planet because ""we destroyed it"" though the destruction seems to have been a mix of nuclear bombs pollution and natural disasters. 1000 years later everyone lives on a planet called Nova Prime where things are pretty peachy except for the occasional Ursa monster a predator that is utterly blind able to hunt based solely upon the scent humans make when theyre afraid. Cypher is FEARLESS and thus doesnt secrete the ""fear"" pheromone so hes able to waltz up to these Ursas and wallop them with impunity. He definitely gives them the ol ""what for"" I tell you. Look here Ursa theres a new sheriff in town and this one cant be smelt. Also check out The Films of M. Night Shyamalan Ranked from Best to Worst Now set aside your thinking cap for just a moment the one that says ""well couldnt they wear airtight suits or make a perfume or use missiles or mix fear smells with poisonous gas or have robots punch all the Ursas or use drones that existed a full millennium earlier to hunt the Ursa down all while they snacked in front of a futuristic monitor?"" No Put all of these thoughts right out of your head ""After Earth"" has no time for your foolishness because its too busy getting Cypher and his son Kitai (Jaden Smith clearly typecast as Wills son) together for an adventure. Kitai wants to be a Ranger too just like his dad but he doesnt have the ""no fear"" part down yet which would make him Ursa lunch or dinner depending on the time of day. Cypher and Kitai (coincidentally the name of my new CBS pilot) are having trouble connecting because dad is always out stomping around secreting nothing but machismo and Old Spice. To alleviate the growing distance between them Cypher brings Kitai along on a training mission that you guessed it goes horribly wrong. They are then marooned on Earth and Cypher is hurt leaving Kitai to perform a dangerous life-saving mission by his lonesome. Hes got his dad to virtually lead him using futuristic ""Go-Pro"" technology every step of the way but hes going to have to prove hes got the right stuff or else they are both gulp dead meat. Thats not a terrible premise. Or rather its not a wholly terrible premise there are good parts in there like the father-son bonding future Rangers and men who have been named Cypher without any subtext whatsoever. Sadly as soon as the action switches to Earth around 20 minutes in its all doom from there on out. Little Kitai fights poisonous slugs a giant bird tigers simians and ultimately ugh himself. Along the way hell have to prove hes every bit the man that dad is even if dad happens to come off as a complete jerky jerk who raised a son that wouldnt be fit to deliver newspapers on a rainy day. Indeed Kitai is the kid youd put in charge if you were working for Team Ursa he has so many ways to fail that the scouts would label him a ""five-fool player"" and draft him the first round of the ""nincompoop draft"". Yes Kitai is instantly unlikable when hes not listening to his parents hes proving he knows nothing about the world and when he is tuning into what his father is saying its usually just so he can come back with a genius rejoinder such as ""I can do it myself Dad I dont need your help"" So unlikable hero a distant and disposable father-son bond but surely the futuristic aspect of ""After Earth"" gets in there and salvages this thing right? Well no. Not at all. If anything it makes it so much worse because when the action parts are playing out riddled with logic problems you find yourself pining for the quiet stupidity of an abusive dad and his ninny son. For instance Kitai wears a fancy suit that alerts him to danger by turning black or to toxins by turning white. Now whatever you do dont ask ""well does it do something else besides turn color like say put up a force field or make him faster or give him medicine or maybe turn on an emergency jetpack or provide a distraction to the predator or camouflage him somewhat?"" No Do not ask these things for the suit has just turned white ooooh how impressive. Why theyve stumbled onto the same lofty technology that the Coors guys use to tell me when my beer is cold Heres another example - the use of spears. Little Kitai Raige (Best band name ever) is sent out to fight thousands of predators with a mutable spear. Oh it changes shapes it can become a scythe a sword whatever sort of weapon you like except for the one that would actually help something along the lines of a machine gun. Can you imagine fighting off a pack of tiger-wolves with a freaking spear? Or outrunning simians without anything resembling advanced technology? ""After Earth"" takes place in a time where we were able to figure out light speed and interstellar travel but any weapon above ""Swiss Army Knife"" seems to outpace our ambition. Thats ""After Earth"" for you where nothing makes any sense at all not the weaponry the relationships the antagonists or the mission itself. Its astoundingly awful. Thankfully once youve gotten past the terrible logic and meaningless relationships ""After Earth"" assaults you with a complete lack of tension. They are trying to kill this Kitai fellow off every ten minutes only what are the chances of them doing just that? Especially 25 minutes in when all the ""action"" commences? Everything in ""After Earth"" is arbitrary. Kitai must get to a transmitter because he needs to transmit. Cypher must not leave the ship himself because hes hurt no one else an be around because theyve only got the one camera crew and so on and so forth. He has exactly enough oxygen to finish the mission Safety each evening is the exact distance he could plausibly reach Cypher can man the computer interface 24/7 because he never needs bathroom breaks or food And so on and so forth into the cold receding distance of irrelevance. The level to which ""After Earth"" is a catastrophe is amazing but whats even more impressive is the lengths everyone must have had to gone to for such an epic level of failure. Everyone involved from director M. Night Shyamalan all the way down to Jaden Smith is culpable and truly capable of so much better. ""After Earth"" shouldnt be seen on this planet and if we ever discover new ones habitable ones we should take steps to make sure its never shown there either just in case. SCORE 1.2 / 10 Laremy wrote the book on film criticism and thinks Shamalans best movie is actually ""Unbreakable"".

(Video) After Earth Reviews Critics Cant Stand Will Smiths Space Adventure Will Smith needs to let his son Jaden figure out what it is hes good at because at the moment at least acting isnt it ""After Earth"" tells the story of an inexperienced boy trying desperately to please his father while making one mistake after another and as such it becomes an uncomfortable metaphor for itself. Jaden Smith""gt;Jaden Smith who stars in the film can at least take comfort in his predecessors - Anjelica Huston stumbled through her father Johns mostly-forgotten ""A Walk with Love and Death"" before eventually becoming an Oscar-winning actress and Sofia Coppola survived the global embarrassment of ""The Godfather Part III"" to become an acclaimed writer and director. Granted Will Smith isnt behind the camera here - that unhappy task has fallen to M. Night Shyamalan whos still basically the trustee of Movie Jail after ""Lady in the Water"" ""The Happening"" and ""The Last Airbender."" Still the elder Smith gets a ""Story by"" and executive producer credit making ""After Earth"" the equivalent of a very expensive bar mitzvah one where dads a successful cantor and his son could have used another month in Hebrew school. Also read Can Will Smith Turn Son Jaden Into the Next Fresh Prince of Hollywood? In a dystopic future an international fighting force known as the Rangers organizes the mass exodus of a polluted uninhabitable Earth. Humanitys new home is subjected to blind deadly monsters known as the Ursa and Ranger Cypher Raige (Will Smith) becomes a legend when his lack of fear makes him completely invisible to the Ursa who track people by the scent of their fear. Cyphers son Kitai (Jaden Smith ""The Karate Kid"") wants desperately to follow in his fathers footsteps but the Rangers keep turning him down; Kitai is physically capable but he hesitates in the field because of a childhood incident in which his older sister (Zoe Isabella Kravitz) died saving him from an Ursa. Also read After Earth Reviews Critics Cant Stand Will Smiths Space Adventure Father and son are traveling on an interplanetary mission when their ship crash-lands on Earth. With the rest of the crew dead and Cypher suffering massive internal injuries its up to Kitai to travel 100 kilometers on his own to find the back end of the ship which contains a functioning homing beacon - as well as an Ursa that has broken out of its cage. With Cyphers stern instructions (and disapproving scolds) ringing in his ears Kitai will have to brave this savage planet to save them both. See photos After Earth to Whip My Hair The Smith Family Showbiz Scrapbook The relatively inexperienced Jaden Smith is asked to carry a movie in which he spends almost all of it by himself talking to a co-star who isnt there and reacting to special effects that will be added later which is a task akin to casting a drama club freshman in a performance of Becketts ""Happy Days."" On top of that all the actors have been instructed to speak in a clunky futuristic patois that could be described as ""Southern Kennedy"" but its the sort of thing that works better on paper. (Unless you really take it all the way like the Russian-inspired slang of ""A Clockwork Orange."") Performances aside ""After Earth"" is a fairly dreary affair weighted down with grimness it never really earns and afflicted with sub-par special effects that keep us from being completely lost inside this world. (The animals of this post-historic Earth have apparently evolved into scarier creatures despite the fact that humans have been gone for only 1000 years a blip in evolutionary time.) There are occasional stirring moments - particularly when Kitai eludes a giant bird of prey while gliding in one of those flying-squirrel suits - but it ultimately feels like a slog of a vanity project.

Night Shyamalan film is that the film is directed by M. Night Shyamalan a fact that the movie--like the posters and commercials--wont admit until after youve already sat through it. While at heart a Pinkett-Smith family bonding project the kind of sci-fi play therapy Big Willie and son would get up to if they had a holodeck the dreary After Earth still bears the stamp of its once-beloved directors authorship. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Theres the handsome scenecraft those smartly constructed revelations and jump scares often sprung on you in a shot that seems to be about something else entirely. (Recall the kitchen drawers and cabinets that suddenly all open in The Sixth Sense--and recall that young writer-directors promise.) Theres that glum high seriousness those characters whose urgent feelings go unexpressed out of some constipating self-involvement that they--or Shyamalan--mistake for stoicism. Theres that endearing insistence upon lit-class symbolism no matter how vague or risible. One meaningful sequence here about the universal desire of parents to nest their young is a straight-up story-wrecker a bit of bedtime story fancy so at odds with the films post-apocalyptic horror that its like if the kid in The Road escaped the flesh-eaters by hitching a ride on a Snuffleupagus.And most tellingly theres Shyamalans principled refusal to subordinate his ideas to mere narrative logic. Just minutes after being told that the planet hes crashed-landed on undergoes a fatal hard-freeze every single night the hero leaps into a river. The water does not seem uncomfortable.Film Details After Earth RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time100 More Info Trailer That freezing is just one of many story elements we just have to take the movies word for like the human-bred monster who cant see but can smell fear or the idea that far-future space warriors would fight said monster with an unlit totally analog double-bladed Darth Maul-style lightsaber stick. Will Smith and his son Jaden play two such space warriors crashed on a mysterious hostile planet. (Just guess which.) Papa is laid up so the kid is dispatched to have the adventures this time with Smith the elder literally handing Smith the younger a baton.The kid has to dash through some 100 kilometers of verdant animal-teeming Mystery Planet That Oh Yeah Freezes Every Night. He has to do this for the same reason that Laura Dern must head to Jurassic Parks maintenance shed or that Super Mario must hop through 8.3 worlds just because. From their downed spaceship dad follows his sons progress on a screen and guides him toward geothermal ""hot spots"" where the kid can sleep safe from those temperatures that would kill him even as they dont faze the flora.Shyamalan filmed this adventure in the California Redwoods and at a black-sloped Costa Rican volcano meaning we get Endor and Mordor and the cover of Dianetics all in the same movie. The look is marvelous especially in the location shooting and especially when young Smith has no CGI critters to contend with. Scenes of a panicky Jaden picking his way through foreboding woods are legitimately suspenseful but fleeting--theres always some cartoon chase or impossible waterfall or--again and again--some contrivance to knock the kid out cold. The Mystery Planet might just be Ozs poppy field. Meanwhile dad--stern joyless the Fresh Prince now a dour warrior king--grumbles ridiculous homilies at him junk cribbed from acting classes Scientology and Tom Cruises scenes in Magnolia ""Root yourself in this moment now. Stop smell. What do you feel?"" And bafflingly as if theyre taking improv together ""Recognize your power This will be your creation.""Jaden is fine at running jumping fearful trembling and affecting steely resolution. He doesnt yet have his fathers charisma; perhaps to help him out dad opted not to bring that charisma to the set. I fear Jaden might face online wrath for his performance here especially thanks to the numb-tongued Kiwi accent hes forced to adopt. Hes not bad especially but he is a kid asked to do the extraordinary compel us as he pretends to do ridiculous bullshit. As Will Smith coldly instructs him to feel to root in this moment now to master his own creation I felt the purest horror I ever have at a Shyamalan film What if this is what Jaden Smiths life is actually like?FINAL SPOILER THOUGHT FOR TERM-PAPER WRITERS The eagle represents that universal drive of parents to nest their young and then just lie there and die like dopes.Follow VoiceFilmClub 1 Ellen Page Kidnaps an Infant in Tallulah but She Means Well NEXT Contact Alan Scherstuhl Follow studiesincrap Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

"Review After Earth a planet to avoid - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview After Earth a planet to avoidBy Charlie McCollumcmccollummercurynews.comPosted 05/30/2013 050000 AM PDTUpdated 05/30/2013 094005 AM PDTClocking in at little more than 90 minutes ""After Earth"" has to be one of the shortest summer ""blockbusters"" on record. Thats the good news.The not-so-good news is that the film a vanity project for Will Smith and family could easily have been condensed to a ""Twilight Zone"" episode -- and a lesser one at that. In fact the late Rod Serling might have rejected the story and its execution as simply too predictable for his TV series.But in Hollywood its hard to say no to Smith whose long string of summertime hits makes studio bosses salivate. When Smith comes calling with a sci-fi flick he wants to make co-starring his son Jaden the correct answer is Sure how much money do you need?The problems start with the story itself which is attributed to Smith. The humans of Earth have abused the planet so badly they eventually have to leave for a distant world Nova Prime. (That premise which isnt remotely original also turns up this year in at least two other films ""Oblivion"" with Tom Cruise and the upcoming ""Elysium"" with Matt Damon.)Protecting the humans on their new world from the indigenous ""monsters"" who take a dim view of their arrival is the United Ranger Corps led by their legendary general Cypher Raige (Will Smith). His son Kitai (Jaden Smith) is a ranger-in-training who just cant seem to cut it when he gets out in the field. Part of the reason is the guilt he feels over the death of his sister (Zoe Kravitz) who was slain by a monster while trying to protect him. And then theres the fact that he feels he will never live up to the nerves-of-steel bravery of his father.Advertisement Pressed by his wife (Sophie Okonedo) to get closer to his son Cypher Raige agrees to take the kid on his final mission a training exercise that involves carting along one of those monsters. But their spaceship is severely damaged in a meteor storm and crashes onto the one planet in the entire galaxy least hospitable to humans. Yep you guessed it theyre back on Earth -- a drastically changed world where all creatures big and small have evolved with a singular instinct to destroy humans. This film publicity image released by Sony - Columbia Pictures shows Jaden Smith in a scene from ""After Earth."" (AP Photo/Sony Columbia Pictures Claudette Barius) ( Claudette Barius ) Father and son are the only survivors and dad is severely injured. So its up to Kitai to find a lost rescue beacon from a part of the ship that broke off before the crash. That means crossing a rugged landscape loaded with nasty killer baboons evolved tigers and really really big condors. Oh and that monster onboard? Its on the loose too.Folks who think theyre paying money for a Will Smith action flick will instead find themselves watching the actor trapped in a spacecraft giving Obi-Wan Kenobi-esque wisdom (you half expect him to utter ""Feel the force Kitai"") from a distance while his son does the heavy lifting. Not to beat up on the kid. Jaden Smith has shown flashes of talent and a bit of his fathers charisma but absolutely no actor young or old could carry this load. The story is clunky. The setup for the main tale is ineptly handled. Bits of the plot including the environmental science of the new Earth make no sense. The dialogue is leaden. And the special effects are surprisingly unconvincing a step or two above the effects in those deliberately cheese ball sci-fi flicks the Syfy channel shows on Saturday night.You can chalk up much of the movies failure to the man at the helm director and co-writer M. Night Shyamalan. After making one terrific film -- ""The Sixth Sense"" his 1999 debut -- Shyamalans career has slid with ever-increasing speed into the cinematic abyss. His last film 2010s ""The Last Airbender"" was such a dud that it looked like it might be his last. Maybe the Smith family missed ""Airbender"" or maybe they believe in the power of redemption. Either way it was a bad mistake because Shyamalans work on this film is a dismal as it was on ""Airbender"" which makes ""After Earth"" a likely contender when those worst films of the year lists come out in December.For film news and more follow Charlie McCollum at Twitter.com/charlie_mccollu.AFTER EARTH  Rating PG-13 (for action violence and scary images)Cast Will Smith and Jaden SmithDirector M.

After Earth Director M. Night Shyamalan Cast Jaden Smith Will Smith Rated PG-13 (sci-fi action violence disturbing images) Running time 100 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 715pm on Thursday May. 30 2013 Thursday May. 30 2013 Thursday May. 30 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram What do you give the kid who has everything? His own summer action-adventure blockbuster of course.Thats exactly what Will Smith has done for his 14-year-old son Jaden with After Earth a sci-fantasy film based on a story idea by the elder Smith and starring father and son -- though Dad definitely has the supporting role. Well it certainly beats a cake and a card but considering what a well-crafted bore After Earth turns out to be perhaps not by much.Its 1000 years after Earth has been destroyed by man and abandoned for some far-flung solar system. Smith the elder is Cypher Raige a stern military commander who may be great at slaying alien beasts on foreign worlds but has trouble connecting with his son Kitai (Smith the younger). To the delight of his long-suffering wife (Sophie Okonedo Hotel Rwanda) Cypher agrees to take Kitai on his next mission off-planet for a little bonding time.But to escape a nasty asteroid storm their heavily damaged ship ends up in a dusty quadrant of the galaxy where the only planet they can crash-land on is some nearly uninhabitable relic called Earth. All of the crew dies except for Dad who has two broken legs and Kitai whos remarkably unscathed.The wreckage with the tail section of the ship where theres a beacon that can be used to call for help is many kilometers away from Cypher and Kitai. So its up to plucky Kitai to brave the fearsome elements (animals have evolved to prehistoric proportions without man around to knock em down to size) retrieve the beacon and save himself and dear old Dad. (Lets not even mention the monstrous creature the ursa the ship was transporting that has now escaped.)Its a simple predictable quest story but if told well it could still be effective. But as directed by M. Night Shyamalan and written by Shyamalan and Gary Whitta ( The Book of Eli) its a self-serious monotone of a movie built around a young actor who though he tries valiantly cant yet carry a film on his slender shoulders.The usually magnetic Will Smith could have injected some energy but hes completely passive reading his lines like an orator and spending most of the movie wounded on his back watching Kitai on the ships monitors which miraculously still work.Shyamalan has created a film that looks good the computer-generated beasts are appropriately ferocious and best of all its not in 3-D. Plus kudos to production designer Thomas E. Sanders for coming up with a future that substitutes lightly colored fabrics and cloth for the expected metal and chrome. Its nice to know Pier 1 will survive whatever catastrophe ravages Earth.Considering the disasters Shyamalan has delivered lately -- The Last Airbender being the most recent -- After Earth is at the very least not an embarrassment. But that may not be enough to turn this exercise in competency into a franchise that will make Jaden a bona fide star and ease his father into early retirement if thats what Will Smith was thinking.Sorry Dad. Looks like youre going to have to keep working for a while. And if you want to give Jaden something special next year why not just settle for a nice party ?

Photo AP After starring in the sci-fi flick ""After Earth"" Jaden Smith may want to rethink his future as an actor. (AP) Jaden left and Will Smith are left gasping for air in the shallow After Earth. ( ) May cause extreme drowsiness reads the flashing warning on a pain killer that Will Smith takes after breaking both legs in his new movie -- a caution that applies equally to ""After Earth. Basically this is Smith and his real-life son Jaden (both affecting ridiculous mid-Atlantic accents) talking the audience to death for something like 90 minutes before the closing credits. Im giving it one star because Smiths longtime enablers at Sony apparently encouraged him to whittle this humorless sci-fi epic down from a much longer movie. The back story in the opening narration -- Earths evacuation following a vague environmental catastrophe -- is boiled down to a couple of sentences. A thousand years later Smith is the aptly named Cypher a general in the United Ranger Corps the military arm of the former Earthlings who have settled on a distant planet and produced exceedingly dull descendants. On the verge of retirement Cypher decides to take his 14-year-old son Kitai along on his last mission. The two have a frosty relationship because were told Kitai blames his frequently absent dad for his sisters death. I have a sneaking suspicion that the fact Cypher wears a perpetual scowl probably doesnt help things. A meteor shower forces their spacecraft to crash land on Earth where Cypher and son are the only survivors in a hostile environment. ""Do exactly as I tell you and we will survive the disabled Cypher barks at Kitai in an order that would probably sound better if papa Smith had delivered it as a rap lyric. Most of the film consists of Kitai traveling miles on foot to recover a rescue beacon and then even less interestingly trying to find the intergalactic equivalent of a cellphone signal. There are exactly two action sequences -- brief pursuit by what look like deranged orangutans and a climactic battle with a badly executed special effect thats supposed to represent a deadly extraterrestrial. Eleven years and several progressively more dreadful movies after ""Signs director M. Night Shyamalan would be lucky to get a gig directing traffic. His work on this reported 150 million vanity project manages to generate no suspense or excitement. Only yawns. Will Smith who co-produced with assorted family members also contributed the vaguely L. Ron Hubbard-ish story for what is laughably described in the press notes as a ""franchise. The erstwhile box-office king who appears to be suffering from delusions of grandeur in recent years really should stick to his day job. Separating father and son for most of the film certainly limits the dramatic possibilities. Whats more while Jaden Smith pulled off the remake of ""The Karate Kid hes not quite a good enough actor (or sufficiently charismatic) to hold the screen by himself in scene after scene. Were left to ponder how Earth remains so green and leafy when the temperatures drop below freezing every night or why all that plant life cant supply sufficient oxygen so that Kitai doesnt have to rely on an imperiled supply of inhalers. He is able to receive Dads overbearing self-help lectures via a communication device -- which like all the 31st-century technology on view is surprisingly more fragile than anything you could buy at the Apple store these days. ""Fear is not real it is a production of your imagination Cypher exhorts Kitai. ""Danger is very real but fear is a choice And so is avoiding the crashing bore that is ""After Earth.

"After Earth movie review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Misdirection expert back to After Earth  1/2 After Earth Jaden Smith stars in ""After Earth."" Jaden Smith stars in ""After Earth."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Director and screenwriter M. Night Shyamalan has gone from being Mr. Twist thanks to ""The Sixth Sense"" to the most doggedly straightforward storyteller on the planet judging from the modestly entertaining ""After Earth."" Its essentially a two-hander showcasing the Smiths Will and Jaden.Smith the Younger has entered that phase of not-quite-this-not-quite-thatness which is the hallmark of being 14. He receives top billing; Smith the Elder of ""I Am Legend"" and (with his son) ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" makes do with second. Co-written by Gary Whitta and the director ""After Earth"" is an Outward Bound sort of adventure set 1000-plus years hence. The usual dire scenario Humanitys cavalier treatment of Earth has led to a mass exodus bigger than the exodus in ""Exodus"" even. The planet is overrun by animals birds bugs and digital effects genetically evolved to kill humans should they return.Jaden S. plays Kitai whose father Cypher (Smith W.) is a ""prime commander"" in the interplanetary security force. Cyphers ability to ""ghost"" makes him invisible and fiendishly effective against the drooling alien beastie known as the Ursa. The Ursa may sound either like a U.S. governmental agency acronym or a Bond girl from the Sean Connery years but its neither. Pop takes junior on patrol with him (""Go and make some good memories together"" coos mom played by Sophie Okonedo) but one meteor shower and crash landing later father and son are back on Earth and Elders dealing with two broken legs and Skyping his advice to Younger while the Younger must a) locate the emergency beacon lost in the crash 100 kilometers away and b) ...Surprise There is no b). ""After Earth"" is what it is a linear series of perils and obstacles. Questing for the beacon Kitai contends with baboons leeches birds of prey tigers and the Ursa. The picture has very little humor but it doesnt go in for the typical digital assault on the eyes. Shyamalan recovers rather well here after the wobbly series of pictures he made after ""Signs"" ""The Village""; ""Lady in the Water""; ""The Happening""; and ""The Last Airbender.""

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet For a 130 million vanity project After Earth is remarkably lean. Conceived by Will Smith as a starring vehicle for his son Jaden the movie is a no-frills wilderness survival tale with sci-fi trappings. For most of its running time its two major characters are the only people onscreen. Big chunks of the movie pass without dialogue. The set-up is clean and simple A spacecraft crash-lands on a deep-future depopulated Earth; the only survivors a father and son must recover the crafts distress beacon in order to be rescued. The father has broken both of his legs. The son is inexperienced. They have few supplies and suspect that their cargo--an alien specimen--has survived. They dont uncover secrets. They dont pass ruined landmarks. They dont get sentimental about their home world or wonder about what humanity has lost by relocating to the stars. As far as the movie is concerned Earth is a hostile planet that their ancestors left with good reason. Acting more or less as a hired gun director M. Night Shyamalan brings considerable formal chops to the project. His style--part arthouse part Spielberg--is well-suited to the material and his knack for framing and editing comes in handy during the movies many dialogue-free scenes including an effective post-crash sequence that intentionally breaks nearly every rule of classical continuity editing. Austere roomy compositions--courtesy of Peter Suschitzky the longtime David Cronenberg cinematographer who also shot The Empire Strikes Back--frame Jaden Smiths character against vast backdrops of swaying foliage; during certain stretches After Earth looks more like an elaborate Werner Herzog homage than a big-budget sci-fi flick. And yet despite all of this After Earth is a mixed bag. Its hard to blame Shyamalan for the downright embarrassing opening a choppy mess of redundant exposition that seems to belong in a different movie. Shyamalan may be an earnest (and some would say corny) storyteller but hes also economical; the openings overreliance on stock footage and plot-explaining voiceover stinks of test-screening rewrites. Then theres the problem of Jaden Smith; bereft of charisma or anything resembling acting talent hes more liability than lead. Fortunately he spends almost the entire movie running jumping and listening to his father talk--all things that the young Smith or his stunt double seem to be very good at. As the father Will Smith spends most of After Earth sitting in a chair. His performance is grim and low-key; occasionally it feels like the elder Smith is trying to throw the film in his sons favor. To further complicate matters all of the movies dialogue is spoken in a futuristic vaguely Caribbean ""post-Earth"" accent which proves to be distracting since neither Smith seems to be able to keep his accent consistent. As if to counterbalance the outsize dynasty-building ambitions of the movies producer/co-star Shyamalan scales back at key moments. Will Smiths centerpiece monologue for instance is composed in chiaroscuro static shots which lends the scene ambiguity. The crash sequence plays out without any music; when James Newton Howards score does come in its frequently modernist and dissonant--not exactly the sort of music youd expect in a father-son bonding movie. Shyamalans sensibility may not be enough to turn After Earth into a great (or even very good) film but it does yield interesting--and at times strikingly realized--results.

Night Shyamalans latest non-happening will prove a litmus test of Will Smiths continued drawing power. The last time M. Night Shyamalan tried his hand at a big-budget ""Man vs. Wild"" episode with 2008s ""The Happening"" the unseen villainess was none other than Mother Nature herself. In the decided non-happening that is Shyamalans latest ""After Earth"" the threats lurking on a post-apocalyptic blue planet include baboons predatory birds and a giant alien beastie that looks like a rejected prototype from H.R. Gigers workshop. (At least there are no Tom Cruise clones.) But its Shyamalans career and that of producer-director Will Smith that seem to be struggling for survival in this listless sci-fi wilderness adventure -- a grim hodgepodge of ""Avatar"" ""The Hunger Games"" and ""Life of Pi"" that wont come anywhere near equaling those juggernauts with the ticketbuying public. Opening in a very crowded summer frame the pic will prove an even greater litmus test of Smiths continued drawing power than 2008s ill-conceived Christ allegory ""Seven Pounds.""This story first appeared in the June 4 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. SEE ALSO M. Night Shyamalan Goes Dark On ""After Earth"" Clearly envisioned as a franchise starter for Smith and Sony ""After Earth"" comes with a detailed press kit offering pages and pages of backstory fleshing out the films futuristic universe little if any of it actually addressed in the pic itself (suggesting either long-range sequel plans or lots of carnage on the cutting-room floor). Smith who gave one of his best performances in the similar last-man-on-Earth vehicle ""I Am Legend"" here mostly takes a backseat to his 14-year-old son Jaden whose Kitai Raige (hows that for a character name?) is a cadet in the United Ranger Corps a militia formed a millennium ago when Earth was in the last stages of its man-made downfall (cue montage of floods fires riots). Now humankind has a new home planet Nova Prime. The only problem a hostile alien species that considers Nova Prime its birthright and has spent most of the past thousand years trying to kill us with genetically engineered monsters known as ursas. Some time before our story begins one such ursa has made lunch out of Kitais older sister Senshi (Zoe Isabella Kravitz) an incident that has driven an emotional wedge between Kitai and his father Cypher (the elder Smith) each of whom on some level blames the other for the loss. Making matters worse Cypher is something like the George Patton of the Ranger Corps storied for slaying ursas with his patented ""ghosting"" technique in which he becomes invisible to the scent-guided creatures by suppressing his pheromone-generating fears. (There is no simple explanation for anything in this movie.) In short Its a tough act for young Kitai to live up to. In a bid to get this slow-moving story started with a bang Shyamalan opens with the spaceship crash that eventually strands Kitai and Cypher on Earth then flashes back 72 hours to pile on yet more backstory. Kitai has failed it seems to advance to the next level in Ranger training putting a damper on his reunion with Dad whos just returned from his latest mission. But as wise old Mom (Sophie Okonedo) advises Cypher Kitai ""doesnt need a commanding officer he needs a father."" So when its time for Cypher to ship out again he brings his son along for the ride little realizing that an asteroid storm will tear their ship to smithereens and leave them the only two human survivors. Theres also one non-human survivor a captured ursa that the ship was transporting to use in a training exercise now loosed from its cage and prowling the Earth. Laid low with a badly broken leg and jacked up on hallucinogenic painkillers Cypher spends most of the rest of the film doing one long ""Camille"" routine while Kitai begins the more-than-60-mile trek to the other half of the ships wreckage to retrieve a much-needed emergency beacon. Its a journey in which a lot of the rules seem rather arbitrary For reasons never satisfyingly explained the Earths atmosphere has become too toxic for human consumption but poses no threat to other oxygen-breathing fauna that seem to have flourished in mankinds absence. At the same time the planets surface temperature has evidently been ravaged by climate change forcing Kitai to get to certain designated ""hot spots"" by nightfall in order to avoid turning into a human popsicle. Papa Smith who also takes a story credit reportedly conceived of ""After Earth"" as a contemporary survival tale set in the wilds of Alaska and the pic might have packed more punch rendered in spare Jack London-esque fashion. Festooned instead with special effects-- from CG animals (none as convincing as ""Pis"" tiger) to bits of CG volcanic ash hovering against charcoal CG skies -- its a leaden affair even at barely 90 minutes (not counting credits). Donning an impermeable tough-guy facade and hovering on the edge of consciousness for much of the running time the senior Smith gives one of the least substantive performances of his career while the undeniably charismatic Jaden toggles between two primary modes of expression paralyzing fear and simmering rage. Though he shares screenplay credit with Gary Whitta Shyamalan is clearly a director-for-hire here his disinterest palpable from first frame to last. Nowhere in evidence is the gifted ""Sixth Sense"" director who once brought intricately crafted setpieces and cinematic sleight-of-hand to even the least of his own movies. This film rather is essentially one long anticlimax culminating in the inevitable duel between Kitai and the amorphous-looking ursa -- a creature as shapeless and indistinct as ""After Earth"" itself. Shot by frequent David Cronenberg cameraman Peter Suschitzky on Sonys new F65 CineAlta digital system the pic sports a crisp but generally undistinguished look with a muted color palette and much obvious post-production image manipulation. Production designer Tom Sanders and costume designer Amy Westcott offer a fairly rote vision of the future in steely modernist architecture and earth-toned unitards.

Shadra Strickland Illustration says June 22 2013 at 402 pm I really enjoyed After Earth. I enjoyed the quietness of the film and the strong coming-of-age story of Katai. Will it compete with movies like World War Z probably not but as a woman of color who appreciates solid acting and touching stories that feature people of color I found After Earth to be a breath of fresh air. I believed in the relationship onscreen between Will and Jayden and hope that this is a reflection of their relationship in real life. With so many negative downright silly or stereotypical stories about people of color After Earth though a tad predictable was a great family movie for me. I fell in love with Jayden Smith and really routed for him throghout the film. Though Will Smiths role was quieter than usual it was effective in the storytelling. I was very pleased and will probably see it again....and Sophie Okenedu...always so lovely. Reply Omg21 says June 17 2013 at 1054 am What is the name of the planet in this film?? Reply Beth says June 2 2013 at 400 pm Just got back from it... so very very bad. Utterly predictable unrealistic plodding and freely ignored basic laws of biology and evolution. The acting was fine but honestly that was the only thing that wasnt truly horrible. Dont waste your money on this one like we did. Reply Micheal Wade says June 1 2013 at 201 am I expect more from Mr Smith on this movie and i know hes trying help his son but turning him into a mini-me wont work He knows this now Let ur son grow up on his own and stop with this crazy stuff Hes not you Mr Smith so let him find his own way This a terrible movie cau ur trying to make ur son you Give him room to grow in whatever path he chooses Reply amazingbear says June 1 2013 at 106 am Yea these critics clearly have a biased agenda against M Night. Just got back from the movie and it was absolutely spectacular. Every minute was captivating the soundtrack classic solid acting by the Smith crew it was a class act. The audience reactions at the end of it were like what the heck were those critics talking about This was by far the best sci-fi of the year spiritual intelligent atmospheric. Go watch it and make up your own mind these 15 per hour critics are just plain lying. Reply godtisx says June 7 2013 at 943 pm Yeah if people stopped long enough to catch their breaths instead of swallowing the sludge I suspect theyd conclude most professional critics are full of it too. Im not the least bit surprised at what youre saying and plan to go see it. I read these reviews for another reason not to figure out if I want to see the film or not. Audiences need to use their own guts or find reviews on personal blogs not online publications. Its political... Reply CoolLoon says May 31 2013 at 929 am Just saw it last night and your review pretty much captures it - production quality and all - except I thought the backstory was woven into the present pretty well. The maternal bird-of-prey storyline was truly touching. In fact for me it is the most memorable emotional vignette in the film. And I too sorely missed Will in action. But I think the film is worth seeing and would recommend to friends on the merit of seeing Smith x 2. Reply johnmccartney says May 30 2013 at 1041 pm WILL SMITH IS HIS NAME AND HIS GAME IS ""FAME"". WRITE ABOUT HIM OR HIS FMAILY BUT IT DONT MATTER. HE HAS BEATEN HIS WIFE OR KIDS HE HAS NOT CAME OUT OF REHAP THE 9TH TIME HE HAS NOT BEEN CAUGHT BREAKING INTO HIS FRIENDS HOMES HE LOVES HIS COUNTRY. HE LOVES HIS FAITH WHATEVER IT MAY BE SO LAY OFF AND ASK THE QUESTION WHY DO WE HAVE DOUBLE STANDARDS IN THE MEDIA GAME? Reply paulmccartney says May 31 2013 at 800 am WHAT??? Reply Patti Rayfield says May 30 2013 at 349 pm I wish Will and the film great success.... Reply LR Hubbard says May 30 2013 at 253 pm Scientology posed as a summer blockbuster movie. No thanks. Reply The Kingslayer says May 30 2013 at 119 pm Will Smith shouldnt have turned down Django. Reply amazingbear says June 1 2013 at 107 am Django sucked. The people are really being dumbed down. Reply ikr says May 30 2013 at 306 pm He was right to turn it down. The Django role called for a low-key personality it was a part that required an actor who could play a humble subsidiary role. Will Smith has too much on-screen personality too much charisma. And yes hes an actor he could just act humble but his larger-than-life persona would have shone through and spoiled the feel of the movie. Jamie Foxx did great. Reply Everyone says May 30 2013 at 254 pm We should all be thankful that he turned it down. Reply LOL says May 30 2013 at 1256 pm In years to come this movie will be remembered as a masterpiece that was way ahead of its time and totally misunderstood by dumb audiences. Shyamalan has made a classic adventure the one he is celebrated for when his obituaries are published. Reply cinemaassassin says May 30 2013 at 113 pm Will you dont need to defend this piece of garbage you already got paid. Reply cinemaassassin says May 30 2013 at 1104 am Hands down the worst film of the year. http//cinemaassassin.com/earth-generations-battlefield-earth/ Reply Debbie says May 30 2013 at 1032 am Just saw a screening of AFTER EARTH. Phony scenery and props boring and lacking any really interesting or even good moments this movie was a dud. Reply amazingbear says June 1 2013 at 108 am Its not for the weak of brains and those lacking in spirituality. Reply Kate says May 30 2013 at 836 pm Why did you go bother to go see it?? It looked liked what you described in trailer Reply Lionel Zavitz says May 30 2013 at 848 am ""(Shyamalans) disinterest palpable from first frame to last."" I think you are describing every Sham film since he cashed in with his first success. He has had no hunger since to perfect a work of art and it very much shows in his last half-dozen or so films his work of this entire millennium. But he still gets paid the 7-figure fees to show up and be completely disinterested so why in the world would he ever consider changing his strategy? Reply Kile Ozier says May 30 2013 at 812 am ""After Birth"" Reply Brandon says May 30 2013 at 550 am Plants dont breathe in oxygen. They ""breathe in"" carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen through the process known as photosynthesis. So thats not really a plot hole. Reply Jake says May 31 2013 at 712 am He said fauna fauna refers to animals not plants. He never mentioned plants. Earth animals breath oxygen just like humans so this would be a significant plot hole. Reply rosalnd says June 1 2013 at 1117 pm A little biology here plants respire just like animals....both use oxygen to ""burn"" glucose and fats. Plants ""fix"" carbon dioxide in photosynthesis-a process that uses the photons from sunlight water CO2 to make glucose. Photosynthesis is not the same thing as respiration. Photosynthesis makes glucose and respiration burns glucose (and fats). All organisms with the exception of strict anaerobic bacteria use oxygen for respiration. Darwin says May 30 2013 at 1111 pm Plants are flora. He said fauna... Reply Verona says May 30 2013 at 633 am Plants still need oxygen at night Reply Scott Foundas says May 30 2013 at 624 am No kidding. It is a question of animals not plants. Reply Proofread says May 30 2013 at 537 am Great review Scott I think you left out the word ""effects"" from this sentence - ""Festooned instead with special -- from CG animals...""

Daily Edition Login to download After Earth Film Review 900 PM PDT 5/30/2013 by John DeFore FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Jaden Smith Columbia Pictures The disappointing sci-fi survival tale does little with its substantial resources. TWITTER Will and Jaden Smith play a father and son marooned on a long-uninhabited Earth. Humanitys home planet hardly merits the name-check in After Earth M. Night Shyamalans sci-fi survival tale whose shipwreck action could (with the exception of a scene where our hero scrawls a crude map over Lascaux-like cave paintings) take place on any old life-supporting globe in the cosmos. The disappointingly generic film which strands a father and son (Will and Jaden Smith) on Earth a thousand years after a planet-wide evacuation will leave genre audiences pining for the more Terra-centric conceits of Oblivion not to mention countless other future-set films that find novelty in making familiar surroundings threatening. Will Smiths presence not just as costar but as originator of the story seems likely to carry box office receipts beyond the benchmark of Shyamalans previous picture the wretched The Last Airbender but those hoping for a franchise should navigate elsewhere. PHOTOS 26 of Summers Most Anticipated Movies Man of Steel Wolverine The Lone Ranger Plans for such a franchise seem to be afoot with filmmakers reportedly having written ""1000 years of backstory"" for these two characters and their society. They must be saving an awful lot for comic book and video game spinoffs though as the film squeezes its millennium-long setup into a few short moments of voiceover introduction. We learn that having ruined our environment humans decamped en masse to Nova Prime which would have been a nice place if not for the monsters that had been bred to kill humans. (By whom? Buy the comic book kid.) Those beasts Ursa are blind but can smell the pheromones humans release when afraid. When a member of the United Ranger Corps the elder Smiths Cypher Raige found himself able to suppress his fear he was suddenly invisible to the monsters. Harnessing this ""ghosting"" technique he became a hero in the still-raging war. What we dont learn in the too-quick intro is how all humankind came to speak in the same accent most reminiscent perhaps of New Zealands -- one that suits none of the cast very well and makes Jaden Smiths voiceover hard to follow. The script also fails to explain why future warriors whose technology allows for a ""cutlass"" whose two ends morph into any type of blade the user requires choose not to use guns or lasers against the mighty Ursa. One assumes its because somebody saw Darth Maul and thought his double-trouble light saber looked cool. PHOTOS 30 Groundbreaking Sci-Fi Films In any event Cypher Raige comes home between long campaigns to find his son Kitai unsettled struggling to live up to his legacy. He decides to take the boy along on an interstellar voyage but the ship is thrown off course by a gravitational storm and must land on the nearest planet. A crash landing on Earth leaves three survivors the Raiges and the Ursa specimen theyd been transporting for use in training aspiring ghost-ers. With both legs badly broken Cypher must coach Kitai via camera phone as he makes a 100-kilometer trek dodging the freed Ursa and Earths own predators to find the chunk of wreckage that can save their lives. This is the first Shyamalan-directed film on which hes not the sole screenwriter and in fact it takes a while to discern any trace of the filmmakers personality in a screenplay credited to him and Book of Eli scribe Gary Whitta. The script hits its action beats competently as Kitai copes with marauding animals and dwindling supplies and works best when the teen is in motion. But Shyamalan is of little help to the actor when Kitai faces internal challenges Jaden Smiths performance all furrowed brow and worried eyes gives us no reason to believe Kitai is made of the same tough stuff as his father. Will Smith meanwhile is as hobbled as his character Forced to sit in a chair slowly bleeding to death as he impotently observes his sons various perils Cypher is a man of action who cant act. Will Smith is a charisma-powered performer made to hide his charm behind a stern military demeanor. (When Kitai enters his first dangerous standoff faraway Dad offers a stoic non sequitur ""Recognize your power This will be your creation."") VIDEO Will Smith Hosts Fresh Prince Theme Song Reunion on BBC One Shyamalan would have to try hard to make another film as bad as Airbender; After Earths missteps in conception and execution are more akin to the head-scratching choices that kept The Happening from fulfilling its doomsday-flick potential. Who let that herd of fake-looking bison roam Earths grasslands and who lit the critical scene set on a tree stump amid roaring waterfalls that was obviously shot on a soundstage? On a planet that now freezes every night how do the flora of tropical rainforests survive? What seasoned soldier would send his son on a deadly four-day mission with a backpack the size of a bicycle seat? The films resolution predictable to any viewer feels oddly impersonal for a father/son bonding tale both dreamed up and enacted by a father for the son following in his footsteps. Whatever the faults of 2006s The Pursuit of Happyness that film employed the bond between the two Smiths much more effectively. One wonders if it might be wise to wait a while before the next pairing -- letting Jaden Smith like Kitai Raige come into his own before asking him to share a screen meaningfully with one of Hollywoods biggest personalities.
