Comments Little Children Recommended Five years after his superb debut feature In the Bedroom writer-director Todd Field returns with another story (2006) set in a close-knit community whose quietness makes the characters unhappiness seem like thunder. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson both disenchanted with their spouses meet in a public park with their preschool children and a series of carefully arranged playdates allows them to nurse their unspoken infatuation until it finally engulfs them. Meanwhile a bitter ex-cop (Noah Emmerich) lets off steam by harassing a paroled pedophile (Jackie Earle Haley) whos come home to live with his doting mother. As in Fields first film the characters are drawn with such compassion their follies become our own and their desires seem as vast as the night sky. Tom Perotta wrote the source novel; with Jennifer Connelly Gregg Edelman and Phyllis Somerville. R 130 min. By J.R.

The setting is the wealthy suburb of East Wyndam Massachusetts. Kate Winslet is Sarah frustrated housewife to a little-seen businessman. Patrick Wilson (Angels in America) is perennial law student and stay-at-home dad Brad whose prom-king looks make him an object of playground fascination for Sarah and the coven of moms with whom she shares afternoon breaks. Neither it turns out is best pleased with their lot or ready to entirely relinquish their wellbeing and desires to their childrens. Meanwhile a sex offender has been released into the gossipy community where finger-pointing takes precedence over self-examination... With its unhurried pace and ultra-knowing narration (Sarahs daughter is described as this unknowable little person) theres no missing the films origins in co-writer Tom Perrottas source novel with its own explicit nods to Madame Bovary. Winslet and Wilson make for sympathetically conflicted leads and the first half offers quietly biting observations on over-parenting and under-directed lives with the amorphous scapegoat of the sex offender making an efficient lightning rod for various anxieties and prejudices. The photography editing and sound design are intelligent and pointed too. But the narrative structure is less satisfying straying from the central dynamic to somewhat laboured subplots before careening back to a melodramatic climax. Less glib than American Beauty and less likely to frighten the horses than Happiness Little Children ultimately seems to display the conformity to convention that so alarms its central characters.

"The Disrespected Arts Journalist Blues | | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Culture Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Observer Music The Disrespected Arts Journalist Blues By Justin Joffe  07/29/16 324pm Patron saint of schlubby music journalists Lester Bangs. More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Starring Kate Winslet Patrick Wilson Jackie Earle Haley Jennifer Connelly Noah Emmerich and Phyllis Somerville. Directed by Todd Field. (R. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The suburbs lend themselves to satire. The satirical fault lines come in the distance between the cultivated image and the reality the contrast between the quest for tranquillity and the unending turmoil and the accoutrements of upper-middle-class contentment and their inability to affect the spirit. In a sense anyone who tries to manufacture an insulated genteel and perfectly safe existence is asking for it -- either from life or from satirists. Yet the satirists usually blow it derailing their suburban lampoons into scattershot parody or as was the case with ""American Beauty"" settling for easy targets and easy heroes. Seen in that light the achievement of ""Little Children"" is all the more significant. Co-written by Tom Perrotta (based on his novel) and co-written and directed by Todd Field the film tells the story of several individuals in an affluent suburb. But by switching perspectives and showing various shadings and sidebars to the main story an attempt is made to convey an all-encompassing vision of suburban life. Perrotta and Field succeed not by guessing but by knowing this world. They understand it enough to see it with cold precision -- and to approach it at times with disarming warmth. The characters arent types but people. The acting is excellent in some cases remarkable and the fact that this excellence is general and includes the entire cast means that were also talking about the direction. As for the writing Perrottas story consistently outguesses the audience going in unexpected directions that seconds later seem inevitable. Filled with moments of painful revelation real comedy and emotional insight ""Little Children"" never lags. One hundred and thirty minutes go by in a shot. Kate Winslet -- a real body and a real face not Botoxed or starved out of existence -- is an ideal vessel for the story. With sharp intelligence and no sentiment she plays Sarah a discontented housewife who treats her adorable little girl like an irritating dog and regards her highly successful husband as an embarrassment. In the case of her husband (Gregg Edelman in one of the most thankless roles the human mind has ever devised) she has a point. Feeling no kinship with the gossipy and unconsciously hostile mothers she sees every day at the playground she is ripe for something new -- and thats when she meets Brad (Patrick Wilson) a stay-at-home dad whose wife (Jennifer Connelly) is the breadwinner. Wilson has a face that implies a character flaw or maybe thats just the way he has been cast (""Hard Candy"" ""Angels in America""). Here hes handsome but hapless lacking in motivation and at loose ends and Brad and Sarah become friends based on their mutual dislocation. Winslet has nothing but good moments in ""Little Children"" but one will have to stand for all Right after Brad kisses Sarah for the first time theres a close-up of Winslet that shows something that no other art form can capture. She is feeling and thinking several things at once some contradictory. To convert those feelings and thoughts into words would imply a sequence and a clarity not present in fact. So what can be said for that moment? (1) Its a highly defined jumble. (2) Its beautiful. (3) Its great acting. People will notice Winslets great performance in ""Little Children."" But I hope people will also notice Jackie Earle Haleys as an ex-con a sex offender who has done time for exposing himself to children. Haley is so good that people may forget that hes acting which means that its also a daring performance. Haley plays fully into the appalling repugnance of the character someone whose internal life is unknowable but who lives somewhere on the line between the human and animal-predator world. His only channel to moral feeling and self-perception is his mother (Phyllis Somerville also brilliant) with whom he lives. Actors have been playing criminals since the birth of cinema but theres something about what Haley does -- the way he portrays the ugliness and the loneliness of the criminal mind -- that feels new. Field and Perrotta are very shrewd. They satirize neither the notion of a sex offender nor the threat that people feel from his presence. The threat is real. The object of satire then becomes the odd release and solidarity that his presence brings to the community. Silent desperation can be worse if theres no material bar to happiness. A sex offender in the neighborhood at least presents an excuse to be agitated. The point ""Little Children"" makes is that without the external threat people would be forced to look inward. Theyd have to notice theyre starving -- and for lack of something they cant even name. -- Advisory Strong language nudity and convincingly simulated sex.

"Winslets longing is at heart of keenly acted Children - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Winslets longing is at heart of keenly acted Children By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  October 20 2006 Much of Todd Fields choice new comic drama ``Little Children "" concerns an affair between two young married people languishing in a mostly white Massachusetts suburb. Sarah (Kate Winslet) is a harried stay-at-home mom. Brad (Patrick Wilson) is her extremely handsome paternal counterpart. (Shes a failed academic. He cant pass the bar exam.) They meet on a playground after a trio of Brad-brained mothers dares Sarah to get his phone number.The timing is good since hes feeling increasingly worthless at home. His knockout wife (Jennifer Connelly) makes successful documentaries and favors their son over Brad. (``Hes perfect"" she coos as he sleeps between them meaning of course that her husband is not.)What ``Little Children"" understands so well and so poignantly is a kind of parental existentialism that hits 30- somethings with kids How does having children make you such a less interesting adult?In building this affair Fields movie which he adapted with Tom Perrotta from Perrottas exceptional 2001 novel comes tantalizingly close to greatness. The first half of the picture is narrated -- by Will Lyman the voice of ``Frontline"" -- in serious sonorous cadences that are put to borderline-surreal use. Its as if National Geographic had produced Rod Serlings ``Twilight Zone"" monologues for NFL Films.The effect might have to be seen to be appreciated but it gives the movie a rich critical distance on what were watching.Field uses Perrottas prose as an anthropological play-by-play. But as he demonstrated in his film ``In the Bedroom"" another astute adaptation of a fine piece of fiction Field understands how to bring out the human core of his material (he tells and shows). The narration is a tool that doesnt cost the movie its emotional resonance. And some images are allowed to speak for themselves.In one beautiful crystallizing moment Sarah looks up longingly from the shimmering town pool where she and Brad contrive to meet (kids in tow) and realizes all she could have with this man. Even though the moment is blinding and the glow fleeting it feels explosively real to her.Then into the pool jumps the films other major character a convicted pedophile named Ronnie (Jackie Earle Haley) whose release back into the community has the whole neighborhood righteously on edge. An ex-cop (Noah Emmerich) heads up a concerned citizens group that hands out fliers warning that Ronnies back. In a chilling funny scene Ronnie a compact fellow blessed (or cursed?) with Haleys powerfully insinuating face heads under the child-infested waters. Someone spots the tube of his snorkel cutting between the underage splashers and the ensuing panic is like the first time a dorsal fin is spotted in ``Jaws.""In Perrottas novel the story of Ronnie shares a moral tether with Sarah and Brads affair. Ronnie is publicly scorned as a matter of the suburbs willful distraction from the other transgressions afoot. Hes a repository for everybodys hateful hypocrisy Who could be worse than a child molester? In Fields movie the character serves a vaguer function. Hes still a bogeyman but before long his presence starts exposing the scripts strained mechanics.That ex-cop terrorizing Ronnie at the home of his mother a grizzled force of unconditional love played by Phyllis Somerville happens to be the captain of the touch football league Brad joins. Perrotta and Field work diligently to make the Ronnie business feel of a piece with the rest of the picture but it never does . So the movie gets into serious trouble when it tries to tie up that story .Until the collapse Field an actor himself gets affecting subtle work from his cast. Wilson is very good in a part most actors would have played as a cipher. Brads self-disappointment is uniquely ironic (a good-looking and upbeat guy who feels like a loser). On paper thats clear but its tough to act. Yet Wilson does for the smile what Baskin-Robbins did for ice cream There are a lot of flavors.Winslet carefully handles Sarahs marital exasperation and uncorked desire. But once the trysts start and the character becomes more outwardly emotive you miss the moony sense of wonder the actor puts across with glances and mumbles.In other words the performance is better when the character is dreamy or defensive -- no more so than during a scene in which Winslet harangues her fellow ``Madame Bovary"" readers at a book club meeting. In that scene you sense that Sarahs life depends on her affair.For her its a means of escape. For Brad its partly a matter of narcissism. Yet the sense of self-rediscovery they retreat into is mutual This is who I was. Field presents this awakening in two great moments of self-regard as both characters gaze longingly at themselves in their bathroom mirrors.Ultimately ``Little Children"" builds a world in which neighborly judgment keeps the rest of this envious repressed community from exploding with further incivility. Secrets and lies maintain the social order the guilty are damned and adulterous fantasies keep the ache of reality at bay. If everybody in this town took as long a look in the mirror as Sarah and Brad can you imagine the hell that would break loose?Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

"Something Rotten in the Suburbs of Little Children washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Something Rotten in the Suburbs of Little Children Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday October 20 2006 In ""Little Children"" the arrival of a convicted child molester in East Wyndam Mass. triggers outrage throughout the community. But in this movies reverse code Ronnie the pedophile (Jackie Earle Haley) is practically one of the good guys. We dont approve of his behavior of course but we empathize with a tormented soul whos hounded by high-minded citizens in a flurry of leaflets and sanctimony. And we understand who the real offenders are people like Larry (Noah Emmerich) the obnoxious ex-cop who takes a bullhorn to Ronnies house at night and Mary Ann (Mary B. McCann) a frosty homemaker who denounces the pedophile before her regular gathering of playground moms. Director Todd Field and co-writer Tom Perrotta (who adapted his book of the same name) have rigged our sympathies making us root for whoever offends these high and mighty New Englanders. And theyve done this in the service of a hugely absorbing social drama that is by turns excruciating sad and sardonic. Were caught up in its emotional sweep feeling compassion for all the pariahs including Sarah (Kate Winslet) and Brad (Patrick Wilson) whose extramarital romance provokes gossipy tongues. Theres something irresistibly compelling about the movies Olympian perspective -- the movie employs a narrator (Will Lyman the voice of dozens of documentaries) -- which puts the flaws graces and sins of suburbia into ironic context. (It should be noted however the filmmakers dont subscribe to the notion that a little narration goes a long way.) Theres no essential difference ""Little Children"" suggests between Mary Ann whose over-regimented life includes sex with her husband on Tuesdays and Ronnie whose idea of excitement is snorkeling among the kids at the local pool. At least Ronnies aware of his issues; his valiant attempts to keep them under lock and key are his version of moral behavior. As with his 2001 movie ""In the Bedroom"" Field takes moral stock of a New England community though the earlier film which presented the case for vigilantism centered on one familys response to an unpunished murderer. ""Little Children"" takes on subtler crimes such as prejudice self-deception and civic hysteria. And its wider in scope following the grand design of films like ""Crash"" in which a collection of unrelated characters are connected by thematic forces. What links the well-to-do residents of East Wyndam is a deep-seated frustration. The happiness everyone seeks -- in jobs marriages relationships or sex lives -- seems to be missing. Theyre not so different from other communities perhaps but the movie shows how their protests and outrage against public scapegoats are plaintive echoes of their own personal turmoil. Sarah seeks out Brad after her husband Richard (Gregg Edelman) starts keeping virtual company with a porn site queen. Brads wife Kathy (Jennifer Connelly) a documentary filmmaker belittles him constantly for his failure to pass the bar exam. But its a mark of the movies benevolent spirit that we feel remorse when Kathy finally realizes how much she loves Brad -- right at the moment her husband is busy elsewhere caressing Sarahs naked rump. Winslet is extraordinarily good transforming persuasively from a woman lost in herself to one radiantly in love. Were moved by the internal struggles she undergoes before allowing herself to feel that ecstasy. As the overgrown kid whod rather be skateboarding than hitting the law books Wilson (Raoul in ""Phantom of the Opera"" and the torturee in ""Hard Candy"") exudes a perfect air of arrested development. And though shes playing a one-note harpy -- at one point telling a book-reading group that Madame Bovary is nothing more than a ""slut"" -- McCann plays that single tone with chilly precision. You cant imagine this movie without her. The most affecting performances however come from East Wyndams most feared household. Haley a former teen star and original Bad News Bear shows the debilitating struggle between Ronnies reflexive perversions and his humanity. And Phyllis Somerville is a subtle triumph as Ronnies mother May who refuses to be intimidated by the bullies outside her door. She never makes Mays actions despite extraordinary circumstances seem like anything more than mommy business as usual. Not surprisingly most of the scenes involving mother and son are the toughest on the audience whether for heartbreak tension comic irony -- or all three. Theres something amusing but devastating about Mays advice to Ronnie not to mention his sexual problems at a first date. That ensuing dinner with Sheila (Jane Adams) a formerly wounded soul trying to get back on her feet becomes one of the movies most touching and shocking developments. But the subtext that Ronnies undergoing this ordeal -- thats how the date feels to him -- to please his mother the only woman who truly loves him is the closest he can get to heroism. Thats enough to choke you up right there. Little Children (130 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for sex scenes nudity and profanity.

It helps her cope with a routine built around her toddlers needs at least for a little while.So if she gets up and talks to the dad the other moms at the park have christened ""the Prom King"" thats just another way of proving shes more alive than they are. And if she asks him to write down his number she knows it will scandalize her friends.But somehow they wind up kissing right there by the swings. Its a joke between two strangers that carries them somewhere else altogether and then its not a joke anymore. Now shell have to avoid this place. They all will.And thats how director Todd Fields strenuously grown-up ""Little Children"" begins with its two main characters embarking on the road to infidelity.All of the adult characters struggle with sexuality and responsibility. Sarahs husband Richard (Gregg Edelman) spends his time logging on to sluttykay.com occasionally wearing panties on his head.The Prom King Brad (Patrick Wilson) is a stay-at-home father vaguely emasculated by the position. Hes supposedly sitting for his bar exams for the third time though he devotes his study time to hanging out watching the kids skateboard outside the library. His gallingly attractive wife Kathy (Jennifer Connelly) is a documentary filmmaker.And then theres Ronnie McGorvey (Jackie Earle Haley) the neighborhood pervert a sexual deviant who just cant help himself -- but perhaps isnt as dangerous as everybody thinks.The movie is based on the novel by Tom Perrotta (who also co-wrote the screenplay). It retains his use of an omniscient third-person narrator an unfashionable device that lends a detached sardonic edge to the intimate subject matter. Field -- who acted in Stanley Kubricks ""Eyes Wide Shut"" -- has mentioned the great directors ""Barry Lyndon"" as an influence here though Kubricks ""Lolita"" is closer in spirit to ""Little Childrens"" beady satiric take on sexual compulsion.Field is a rare American director who appreciates the virtues of breathing room he allows scenes to develop in their own sweet time trusting that we will find the undercurrents of human behavior as fascinating as he does. Even in the comparatively sketchy relationship between Brad and Kathy Field communicates volumes of mistrust through something as subtle as an unspoken thought.But as in Fields first film ""In the Bedroom"" -- a study in grief that turned into vigilante fantasy -- theres a tension in ""Little Children"" between the filmmakers generous faith in his characters and the more bottom-line demands of commercial moviemaking.Its a shame because in general Field doesnt take the easy out. Demonized at first Haley is allowed some space to get under the pockmarked skin of his suburban monster. Indeed Ronnies relationship with his mom (a fine performance by stage veteran Phyllis Somerville) is the best example of a functional family relationship in the movie. Haley also pulls off the movies most challenging scene a blind date where he reveals the best and worst of himself his compassion and his contempt.But then there are scenes such as Sarahs spirited book club defense of ""Madame Bovary"" interpreting the doomed Emma as a feminist heroine rejecting a life of conformist misery. Thats fine but its also an obvious parallel for Sarah -- and the movie dodges a number of questions the interpretation raises.Most of us live somewhere on the intersection between desire and propriety looking for wriggle room even as we pay lip service to standards we struggle to keep. Such hypocrisies are grist to the satirist and Field and Perrotta tease out the ironies without patronizing their flawed and feckless characters.Still its a problem that Richard (Gregg Edelman) virtually disappears from the movie (what did Sarah ever see in him?) and Field makes heavy weather of Ronnies relentless persecution by Brads buddy Larry (Noah Emmerich) (""Did you ever think about the term Homeland Security?"" Larry wants to know). These flaws are exacerbated by a hysterical ending that undermines much of what has gone before.Were all little children at heart the film woefully concludes running scared crying for mommy. Its an infantile ending for such a studiously grown-up movie.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 6 2006 525 PM The Beautiful and the Damned Todd Fields Little Children. By Dana Stevens Kate Winslet in Little Children Little Children (New Line) is like a pretty well-tended suburban mom who after an hour of pleasant conversation suddenly lights up a cigarette and launches into a wry raunchy and finally heartbreaking story. You know from the get-go that its beautiful but it takes time and patience to discover that its also funny sexy and sad. Tom Perrotta who adapted the script from his 2004 novel is a natural match for co-writer and director Todd Field (In the Bedroom). When Alexander Payne made Perrottas Election into one of the best movie comedies of the 1990s he had to tweak the novels gently satiric tone to match his own far bleaker sensibility. No one in Election the movie is really likable though Matthew Brodericks self-serving protagonist elicits a guilty sympathy. But Field and Perrotta share a real affection for even their most thwarted and self-deluded characters. Theres no one in Little Children who isnt likable not even the pedophilic pervert Ronnie James McGorvey played to perfection by Jackie Earle Haley. Advertisement The multiple story threads all converge around McGorvey who has just been released from prison for indecent exposure to a minor as the movie begins. The town seizes upon him as a kind of symbolic sacrifice an aberration to be cast out. Mary Ann (Mary B. McCann) the rigid leader of the stay-at-home-mom brigade recommends castration to the amusement of Sarah (Kate Winslet) who we soon learn is the odd mother out at the playground. A literature grad student who never finished her dissertation Sarah is a scruffy brainy misfit trapped in a bad marriage and a life of stultifying privilege. The scripts contention that shes also plain-looking is a stretch--yeah that Kate Winslet what a dog--but Winslet is versatile enough to show us that Sarah feels uncomfortable in her body. That is until she initiates an adulterous fling with Brad (Patrick Wilson) a handsome househusband whom the playground moms have nicknamed the ""Prom King."" Soon Sarah and Brad are meeting every weekday at the town pool and having sex during their childrens nap time flouting community standards with a shamelessness straight out of Madame Bovary (which becomes a reference point later in the film). Kathy (Jennifer Connelly) Brads maddeningly beautiful wife is so busy earning a living that she takes a while to notice that her husband is not only cheating on her but getting mixed up with the likes of Larry (Noah Emmerich) a retired cop who vents his barely repressed rage by tormenting McGorvey and his mother May (Phyllis Somerville). Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. As Brad and Sarahs affair heats up and Larrys pursuit of the McGorveys intensifies we begin to suspect that the town pervert may be less of a danger to the local children than their own harried anxious and self-obsessed parents. Sarah Pierce is a female character of a type rarely seen in mainstream cinema a mother whos neither fiercely protective of her child a la Jodie Foster in Panic Room nor sweetly aglow with maternal contentment a la every Hollywood mother since Doris Day. Instead shes lackadaisical and ambivalent affectionate with her daughter Lucy (Sadie Goldstein) but reluctant to cast her lot with the adult reality of parenthood. In one of the movies harshest scenes Sarah smiles into the mirror after a shower fondly recalling her weekend away with her lover as her daughter bangs on the bathroom door offering her mother a homemade gift. It would be easy for the film to take on the Mary Ann role here clucking at Sarahs parental negligence. But though everyone whos been a child will feel for little Lucy in this scene anyone who has children will also understand Sarahs need for that moment in front of the mirror. Little Childrens pleasures are many (including an almost Hitchcockian climax) and its troubles are few (including unfortunately a cumbersome and condescending voice-over straight from a PBS documentary). All of the actors most notably Winslet are superb but the movie belongs to Jackie Earle Haley a former child actor who after a long career hiatus was also recently seen as Sugar Boy the governors chauffeur in All the Kings Men. Haley a slightly built man with a drawn haunting face played the likable runt in both Bad News Bears (1976) and Breaking Away (1979). If this realization means anything to you at all it will make you feel very very old as you watch Little Children where Haleys desiccated McGorvey seems to have weathered the worst that life has to offer. McGorveys final fate a radical rewrite of the novels ending may strike some viewers as overdetermined and melodramatic. But the uncanny lucidity of Haleys performance makes it moving nonetheless. Little Children lavishes an almost parental mercy on its flawed and damaged characters finally linking McGorveys offenses to Sarahs without damning or forgiving either one.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor October 6 2006 Save for later Saved Suburb bashing is back. That overrated Oscar winner ""American Beauty"" set the template for funny-sad movies about angst-ridden denizens of the burbs and now ""Little Children"" carries it forward.Or maybe backward would be more accurate. Tom Perrottas popular 2004 novel is co-written and directed by Todd Field whose debut feature ""In the Bedroom"" gave a devastatingly accurate depiction of how people cope with grief and misery.But that film was based on fiction by Andre Dubus a far more brooding and complex writer than Perrotta who also gets coscreenplay credit on ""Little Children."" By turns jokey portentous and pretentious the movie immediately sizes up each of its protagonists and never budges from that assessment. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Sarah (Kate Winslet) is a mom with a masters degree in English lit who seems confounded by her marriage to a high-powered businessman (Gregg Edelman) who turns out to have a penchant for porn. Brad (Patrick Wilson) a Mr. Mom who cant manage to pass the bar exam is the hunk she takes up with. (The other local moms breathlessly refer to him as ""the Prom King."") His wife Kathy (Jennifer Connelly) is a successful PBS documentarian with a well-to-do background and a snippy no- nonsense attitude at home. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Driving a wedge through this East Wyndam Mass. community is the arrival at his mothers house of Ronald (Jackie Earle Haley) after serving two years in prison for indecent exposure to minors. The town is papered with posters warning parents of his presence. In one sequence Ronald in mask and snorkel dives into a public pool filled with children. Field films the scene like something out of ""Jaws.""To their credit the filmmakers dont try to downplay Ronalds creepiness by pretending hes just some misunderstood Boo Radley type. In the films best scene he goes on a blind date with a woman (Jane Adams) who is almost as troubled as he is. By evenings end she lives to regret it.But Ronalds main function in the movie is as a decoy. Everyone is so troubled by his perversities that they ignore their own. We in the audience are put in the position of judging everyones behavior and just in case were stymied a facetious-sounding male narrators voice clues us in. This overly literary device drops out about halfway through for no apparent reason only to resurface near the end.Although some of the actors are terrific especially Winslet Haley Adams and Phyllis Somerville as Ronalds loving mother their work is undercut by the films attitude of smirky superiority toward its characters. The superiority is unearned. ""Little Children"" is nothing more than ""Peyton Place"" with a Ph.D. Grade C Rated R for strong sexuality nudity language and some disturbing content.

When did the Pedophile Menace Alert get raised to red in this country so proud of its hazard-free swing sets and juice boxes? Little Children a jolting artfully made drama set in and around a suburban playground somewhere between American Beauty and In the Bedroom on Americas psychic highway is populated by parents who are surprised by adulthood and children who are treated like projects built by competitive students of What to Expect... books. The trouble -- satiric and dead-serious in turn -- begins when two of those adults are shaken out of their own childlike stupors one day by dangerous grown-up desire Sarah (Kate Winslet) the restless mother of a little girl and wife of a man (Gregg Edelman) lost in work and Internet porn (the latters a misplaced satiric touch) meets Brad (Patrick Wilson) the passive handsome father of a little boy and stay-at-home husband of an alpha-female documentary filmmaker (Jennifer Connelly). What begins as an idle hug -- a playground dare really to shock some gossipy mothers -- becomes something first emotionally important and then sexually urgent even torrid. The coupling on screen is hungry and exposed something with which only an actress as honest and confident as Winslet can be entrusted and to which Wilson responds with vigor. The two make a riveting attractive couple of unhappy lovers who unlike the cartoon cavorters in Desperate Housewives have no intention of messing up their nests and then do so; it is no accident that Sarah joins a book-group discussion of Madame Bovary or that Todd Field directs with the same sensitivity to male and female failings he brought to In the Bedroom. Almost all the parents meanwhile remain pathetically immature in their lack of psychological self-awareness a condition Field alludes to with just the faintest raising of an eyebrow and some judiciously applied third-person narration. (Will Lyman the stentorian voice of so many Frontline documentaries provides a cool tone of sociological detachment.) And that middle-class naivete is brought into even sharper focus by the introduction of Ronnie (All the Kings Mens Jackie Earle Haley whose very skull conveys depravity) a pedophile who did time for indecent exposure and now lives nearby with his own aging mommy (Phyllis Somerville). As Tom Perrotta makes clear in the 2004 novel on which he and Field based their fine screenplay the parents in Little Children cant recognize need in themselves or their kids. But they think theyre experts when it comes to Ronnie urging constant monitoring and even further punishment at the slightest opportunity -- a calling to which one overwound ex-cop (Noah Emmerich) responds with zeal. Who are the little children in this dark tragicomedy? It depends on how broadly you define the neutral word playground.

"Little Children | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; little-children ) Little Children (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Its not necessary to look at the color of the leaves to determine the season of the year when movies of this power come along. Little Children the second feature from director Todd Field (In the Bedroom) is the rarest of movies - a literary multi-character drama. From the erudition of the voiceover narrative to the three dimensionality of the characters Fields film is the closest its possible to get to a book without reading one. The story is presented in an unhurried fashion with all the characters and situations being allowed to develop and expand in a natural fashion. Although this is an ensemble piece there are two anchoring characters. They are Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson) and Sarah Pierce (Kate Winslet) neglected spouses who find happiness in each others company as they chaperone their childrens playdays. It takes a while but they eventually give in to the inevitable and become lovers. They dream of being with one another but that seems more like a fantasy than a hope grounded in reality. Other characters orbiting like satellites around the main pair include Kathy (Jennifer Connelly) Brads controlling wife; Richard (Gregg Edelman) Sarahs porn-obsessed husband; Ronnie McGorvey (Jackie Earle Haley) a convicted pedophile; and Larry Hedges (Noah Emmerich) an ex-cop turned vigilante. Theres enough material here to fuel a series of lurid melodramas but Field (who co-wrote the screenplay with Tom Perrotta upon whose book it is based) keeps things low-key and under control. The scope of the project never gets away from him. The voiceover (unlike most voiceovers) is helpful since it emphasizes the storys literary roots. Delivered in a smooth baritone (that of Will Lyman who can be heard on PBS Frontline) it offers observations and editorials on the action occasionally with more than a hint of sardonic wit. The performances especially those by Kate Winslet Patrick Wilson (the tortured pedophile in Hard Candy) Noah Emmerich and Jackie Earle Haley are tremendous. Winslet and Wilson face the challenge of portraying regular intelligent people who are trapped by the normalcy of their lives. Emmerich and Haley on the other hand must play individuals with monstrous personality defects and they do so without making their characters seem either unduly sympathetic or reprehensible. This is especially difficult for Haley considering the nature of Ronnies crime (he exposed himself to an underage girl) but the actor succeeds. It might seem to some that Little Children meanders too much or could have been better focused. While I agree that any of the characters would have made an excellent choice for a feature film Fields goal here is to present a slice of the community - the soccer moms the bored housewives the disempowered husbands. The main story deals with Sarah and Brad but the other characters are given existences of their own which is rare in motion pictures and Little Children is richer for it. With In the Bedroom Field demonstrated his mastery of difficult dramatic material and his ability to direct actors. His sophomore feature which avoids the dreaded ""slump"" reinforces those characteristics and gives us reason to believe Field is a director whose next project should be met with anticipation.

The Madame Bovary-in-suburbia motif may sound familiar yet the unusual mix of satire and melodrama feels fresh.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Rats in a Cage Everyones going to hell in The Departed and Martin Scorsese has fun killing them off along the way. By David Edelstein Published ShareThis Illustration by Atelier  (Photo Courtesy of Warner Bros. ) Closely patterned on the 2002 Hong Kong thriller Infernal Affairs Martin Scorseses The Departed has an ingenious pretzeled symmetry. The story transplanted to Boston centers on two youngish deep-cover agents a cop (Leonardo DiCaprio) posing as a mobster and a mobster (Matt Damon) posing as a cop. The first surreptitiously alerts the police captain (Martin Sheen) that a deal is going down then the second alerts the crime boss (Jack Nicholson) that the cops are on the way. Then the first alerts the captain that the mobsters know the cops are on the way then the second alerts the crime boss that the cops know the mobsters know the cops are on the way. You can see how things might get tricky particularly as each rat becomes aware that he has a rat-doppelganger on the opposite side and attempts to sniff him out. Plenty of movies and TV shows portray the paranoia and loss of identity that come with undercover life. But this one has double-double mirror-image variables to mess with the characters headsand by the way I mean that literally The last film with so many geysers of brain matter featured Freddy squaring off against Jason. Major American auteurs dont usually sign on to do remakes of foreign hits. My guess is that what attracted Scorseseapart from the paycheckwas the chance to fashion a fast mean relatively impersonal crime thriller in which everyone is damned to hell. Theres no mercynot even for the audience. (The movies theme song is the Stoness Gimme Shelter.) William Monahans dialogue is Mamet-speak played at Alvin and the Chipmunks speed with a broad Boston accent. While characters spit yahmuthahfuckedme expletives into one anothers faces (along with peculiar citations of Shakespeare Freud and James Joyce) Scorsese and his fab house editor Thelma Schoonmaker drive the action brusquely. They cut from Costigan (DiCaprio) to Sullivan (Damon) to Costigan to Sullivan with each man in the same location in the frame. They can hardly sit still in the present; they leap around in time splintering a moment into its antecedent and aftermath. They chuck in random splattery head shootings and bashingslike demitasses of espresso in the middle of a long road trip. BACKSTORY In Angels in America Patrick Wilson played the all-American Mormon with a secret. In Hard Candy he played the handsome stranger with a secret. In Little Children he plays a clean-cut father whose nickname is The Prom Kingand wouldnt you know it he has a dark secret too. What gives? Even in musicals one of my first jobs was in Carousel playing a lead guy who happens to be this very abusive husband searching for redemption he says. I guess when I get offered the Prince Charming rolesthe all-American rolesthe only reason theyd interest me is if they had the other side. The movie works smashingly especially if you havent seen its Hong Kong counterpart and havent a clue whats coming. But for all its snap crackle and pop its nowhere near as galvanic emotionally. The star of Infernal Affairs Tony Leung had the stillness of a volcano; in the film Hero he made practicing calligraphy seem fiery. DiCaprio as good as he is is on the lumpish side. He has a wide face and lots of brow to furrow but Scorsese doesnt linger on him long enough to help us connect with his feverish alienation. Its easier to read Damon with his darting little eyes and slippery-squirt smile but we dont give a fig about him. Monahan has made the character more of an out-and-out villaina conscienceless opportunistthan he was in the original. Sullivan hungers for a career in politics. He has no loyalty to anyone not even his surrogate-father crime boss and so he has no dramatic stature. Plus hes lousy in bed. The Departed clocks in at two and a half hours yet its two and a half hours of jabber and jolt; even the scenes between Costigan and the court-appointed shrink he tumbles for (the vivid blue-eyed Vera Farmiga) degenerate into insult-fests. Classical conductors speak of the ability to sustain the long lineto stay measured to resist the impulse to break a passage up into too many climaxes. Scorsese brilliant as he is isnt a long-line kind of guy. Hes a fits-and-starts man and he and Monahan blow the films intricate centerpiece in which both undercover agents under tight scrutiny tap out messages to their bosses on concealed cell phones. The sequence doesnt have much kick because it doesnt have much clarity and it ends abruptly with a shrug. The Departed has enough tension to keep you engrossed though and enough color for ten crime pictures. Scorsese obviously adores his expensive expansive ensemble and this is one of the few films in which the actors over-the-top Boston accents actually enhance the performances. Sheen with his grayish hair swept back does a puttering little avuncular number thats hugely likable and as his snarling sergeant Dorchester native Mark Wahlberg gets back in touch with his inner Southie delinquent and almost steals the picture. But hes matched expletive for expletive by Alec Baldwin as the head of the police task forcepreening happily his diction overdeliberate his twinkling self-infatuation contagious. Now that Nicholsons Mulholland Drive neighbor Marlon Brando has given up the ghost theres no one on earth whose appetites seem as mythic. As the crime boss Frank Costello he looks great. Not healthy but not puffyhaggard in ways that make him more magnetic than ever and with burning eyes. The Boston accent does wonders for himit keeps him from slipping into that familiar lazy singsong. In the first half of The Departed when Nicholson plays it straight and self-contained hes shockingly effective and very scary. I wish Scorsese had nixed the idea to have him swing a big dildo as a gag in a porn theater. As Costello becomes more unhinged he also becomes more Jack and we know you cant kill Jack with ordinary bullets. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Displaying many of the same qualities that distinguished Todd Fields debut feature ""In the Bedroom"" ""Little Children"" is a deftly made emotionally acute and at times a tad fastidious examination of cracks in middle-class American family life. Adroitly adapted from Tom Perrottas fine and popular 2004 novel with every literary reference neatly in place this New Line release about an affair between a married man and woman in a community troubled by the return of an unwelcome neighbor will tie many viewers particularly women up in knots and should follow in the critically and commercially successful footsteps of its directors previous picture. Literary feel is established at the outset by the dry oh-so-faintly superior tone of the narration (commentarys faintly ""Barry Lyndon""-ish quality shows its not for nothing that Field acted for Stanley Kubrick and now employs as associate producer longtime Kubrick colleague Leon Vitali). What at first seems an apparent narrative crutch increases in amusement with abundance to the point that its missed when dropped through the long midsection. Dramatic attention alights upon four women watching their young children at a playground three nattering types and one outsider Sarah (Kate Winslet) a more pensive observer with little patience for extended discussion of toddler issues. The three cackling hens go into a dither at the arrival of a long-absent young father so dreamy theyve dubbed him the Prom King. Theyve never dared speak to him as hes played with his little son so Sarah delights in betting she can get his phone number. Instead in a beautifully played scene that locks the viewer into the protags story they have a delicate probing chat which ends with them briefly kissing in front of the children and other women. Theres no doubt where this is going but it takes a while getting there. Through the hot summer Sarah and the clean-cut jock (Patrick Wilson) whose name is Brad (changed from Todd in the book perhaps by a director uncomfortable with too many Todds around) meet with their respective kids amid hundreds of other similar folk at the large community pool. Gradually their dissatisfaction with their superficially contented lives seep to the surface. Sarah has a masters degree in English lit and never imagined herself as a suburban mom married to a successful businessman (Gregg Edelman) especially one shes just walked in on pleasuring himself to the Slutty Kay Web site with a pair of panties adorning his face like a gas mask. Brad married to a striking PBS documentary filmmaker Kathy (Jennifer Connelly) is unenthusiastically anticipating taking the bar exam for the third time; when hes supposedly studying nights at the library hes instead hanging with skateboarders or practicing for the police football team with his ex-cop buddy Larry (Noah Emmerich). Another guy with too much downtime Larry with boorish zeal leads the local protest against the return home of a convicted sex offender Ronald James McGorvey. Latter is very effectively played by Jackie Earle Haley a teen standout in ""The Bad News Bears"" and ""Breaking Away"" absent from the bigscreen for 23 years; hes also in the upcoming ""All the Kings Men."" A creepy ferrety-looking man McGorvey freaks out the moms one day by jumping in among the kids at the public pool. Principal attention naturally remains on the central couple who 55 minutes in begin coupling in sweaty but at least for the viewer unerotic frenzies during the day when their spouses are away and their kids are napping. All goes well until the two unadvisedly decide to dine together with their respective spouses when a slip of the tongue confirms Kathys suspicions. Still the pic spends an unexpected amount of time with ex-con Ronald whose doting mother (the wonderful Phyllis Somerville) encourages him to date again. This leads to a startlingly tender if ultimately dismaying dinner scene between Ronald and the emotionally damaged Sheila (Jane Adams terrific) and Ronalds path eventually comes to cross those of the other characters in a way that will have most mothers in the audience cringing. Like ""In the Bedroom"" ""Little Children"" at well over two hours is somewhat long for an intense intimate drama and arguments could run many ways concerning what could be tightened or excised. More than one TV newscast goes on at length a docu interview Kathy conducts with the son of an Iraq war casualty seems notably dragged in the football sessions are indulged and a womens book club meeting devoted to ""Madame Bovary"" requires Sarah to address the issue of adultery in an almost absurdly on-point manner. At the same time it could legitimately be said that all these scenes are good and enrich the overall texture of the film. Although Sarah is a conflicted contemplative woman shes not particularly hard to read meaning shes not the most fascinating character Winslet has played of late. Appealing but glammed down to suit her domestic domain the thesp anchors the film with a strong intelligent performance. Wilson fills the bill as the handsome Peter Pan who has yet to grapple with the challenge of supporting a family although the character could have used a hint of an edgy undercurrent or the suggestion of anxiety about his future. Respective spouses are somewhat shortchanged as one never learns what makes Connellys Kathy tick and Edelman as Sarahs husband completely disappears for long stretches to the point where one mistakenly imagines hes been banished by his wife. One curious detail is Brads complaint that Sarahs eyebrows are thicker than he likes when Connelly as his supposed physical ideal has the thickest eyebrows of any woman around. Pics craftsmanship reps a step forward from ""In the Bedroom"" with Antonio Calvaches lensing and David Gropmans production design helping create a comfy everyday feel just waiting to be infected by the untoward actions of the characters. Tale is specifically set in East Wyndam Mass. but was filmed in New York. Little ChildrenProductionA New Line Cinema release of a Bona Fide/Standard Film Co. production.
