E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + I suppose one should never completely abandon dull literary movie franchises. The third installment of ""Harry Potter remains the best of the lot and theyre all an improvement over the dreary first two. But Im afraid Im running out of optimism for ""The Chronicles of Narnia series. After three movies it still doesnt work (there are four more books to go). Today brings ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. It makes you realize that had Harry Potter not come into some lucky casting that series could look like this one a high-end middle-school tribute to a book everybodys read.At some point our young heroes are told theyll need ""great courage to break an evil spell. Could that spell be boredom?The big deal of C.S. Lewiss book was the introduction of annoying cousin Eustace to the Pevensie childrens adventures. England remains perched on the cusp of WWII and while Susan and Peter are off with their parents Edmund and Lucy have been stuck with their unbearably pragmatic kin.On the page Lewiss religious intent was clear. Eustace doesnt believe in Narnia until of course he does. But to a young reader who cant yet make out Lewiss Christian allegory Eustaces skepticism mocks the magical fun we had in the preceding books and would like to continue having. He was another villain. The movie accidentally upends his disdain. That disenchantment now is ours. Once Eustace experiences the holy computer-generated lion-lord Aslan (Liam Neesons voice) his snobbery melts into worshipful awe which sadly isnt viral.Still Will Poulter the young actor who plays Eustace uses his flared pig nostrils to create a mild obnoxious diversion. He Lucy (Georgie Henley) and Edmund (Skandar Keynes) enter Narnia through a seascape painting and spend a lot of the time -- too much -- aboard the Dawn Treader which is captained by the former Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) now king of Narnia. Barnes still looks like hes king of Pine Valley or ""General Hospital. Hes soap-operating. Caspians quest entails the rescue of seven lost lords and their swords in order to keep Narnia from doom. His climactic Henry V-ish pre-combat speech would be rousing only if Agincourt were the name of a new Narnian nightclub.Caspian devotes time to squabbling with Edmund over who is truly king while Lucy obsesses over her looks. That really is the films most fascinating development. Its the movies only real human development. She doesnt think shes as beautiful as Susan which is touching since its too soon to tell whether Susan actually is a beauty. At some point Lucys fascination attracts a dark spell in which she and her sister become the same person. If ""Black Swan is playing in an adjacent theater the envy from next door might be palpable.Otherwise ""The Dawn Treader features all the swordfights and ectoplasmic industrial light and magic youd expect. Its true that the appearances of a giant fire-breathing dragon and an enormous (and effectively disgusting) slug are fun for a scene. But theyre in the service of a story that now functions like the instructional plot of certain video games ""Until you lay down the seventh sword evil has the upper hand. All thats missing is a sinister ""Mwwa-ha-ha-ha or witchs cackle.The veteran director Michael Apted has been brought aboard ""The Dawn Treader and he keeps things safe and professional. Still it looks as if Peter Jacksons ""Lord of the Rings movies have made all other murky epic-scale computer-generated action look derivative. Apted might have had a better time whipping up filthy sight gags for his lone James Bond movie ""The World Is Not Enough another autopilot franchise. Wholesomeness becomes Apted as well but how does he cope with the swashbuckling mice turning Tilda Swinton into a job for Ghostbusters and one instance of Aslan ex machina?""The Dawn Treader like its predecessors has no real struggle or drama. Were dealing with kids for whom everything comes too easily for us to care. When lost or scared or in need of protection they need only turn heavenward. Aslan is an amazement for them. But Hes hell on excitement.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. Follow him at www.twitter.com/wesley_morris. (c) Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company.

Natalie Portman stars as the obsessively dedicated emotionally stunted and perhaps going crazy ballerina Nina Sayers in ""Black Swan.""

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post So the question of ""this week in movies"" might be Is ""Black Swan"" an ugly duckling or a rare beauty? While I enthusiastically vote the latter its no surprise that many viewers will be torn when it comes to director Darren Aronofskys perversely magnificent psychological thriller starring an undaunted Natalie Portman as a ballerina who gets the part of a lifetime -- the Swan Queen and her dark double -- if only she can keep it together. ""Black Swan"" is at once serious and silly absurd and artistically stunning engaged and wildly boneheaded. The screenplay -- penned by Mark Heyman Andres Heinz and John McLaughlin -- mixes a cocktail of sources. Among them Roman Polanskis plunge into female hysteria ""Repulsion""; Joseph L. Mankiewiczs ""All About Eve""; and Aronofskys own performance drama ""The Wrestler."" Composer Peter Ilyich Tchaikovskys 19th-century ballet ""Swan Lake"" of course took fairy tales of enchantment and dark magic as its foundation. And fairy tales themselves represent the tortured and twisted fears and wants of we poor humans. Obsessively dedicated emotionally stunted Nina Sayers (Portman) has a shot at moving from the ballet corps to a soloist role. The New York ballet company lorded over by artistic director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) has an aging prima ballerina (Winona Ryder) and plummeting subscriptions. Whom will he promote? The technically gifted Nina or fiercely spirited newcomer Lily portrayed with carnal ease by Mila Kunis? Ninas a perfect fit as the Swan Queen but too rigid for the Black Swan. From the start Ninas anxiety is high. She appears to spy her double more than once. She gnaws her cuticles ruthlessly. Or does she? This teetering is central to the movies allure. The pas de deux between Ninas story and the ""Swan Lake"" characters is vital and hallucinatory. And theres little straightforward about ""Black Swan"" which enters the ranks of fine films in which the protagonists madness is mirrored by the films unfolding narrative. Portman gives a performance that feels as powerfully unhinged as it is deeply disciplined. Thats the idea. Will Ninas rise be breakthrough or breakdown? Frenemies abound beginning arguably with Ninas mother Erica with whom Nina lives. After a day of back-breaking toenail splintering work the 20-something returns to a room of stuffed animals and pink fabrics. Its not pretty and production designer Therese DePrez goes all out. Barbara Hersey portrays the retired ballerina and concerned mother. Is she a zealous protector or jealous rival? And what of Lily -- friend or foe kind or conniving? Whichever Kunis makes for a likeable onscreen presence. Yet another alum of ""That 70s Show"" she proves what a unbelievably good eye that slight television series casting folk had. French actor Cassel is erotically charged as the manipulative visionary artistic director who dumps embittered ballerina Beth Macintyre in search of a new ""princess."" In order to be sublime ""Black Swan"" risks being ridiculous. The filmmaking is often devastating. Matthew Libatiques camerawork Dan Schreckers visual effects and Andrew Weisblums editing allow for dramatic unblinking fantastical transformations. Composer Clint Mansells score entwines with Tchaikovskys looming glorious notes. Yet Aronofsky and his writers revisit not particularly updated notions about female sexuality in terms of hysteria and frigidity the transit from Girl to Woman via lesbian desire and heterosexual sex. At times ""Black Swan"" verges on laughably old school. Still what a brazen bold riff on the cost -- physical emotional -- of art. With ""The Wrestler"" Aronofsky revealed and identified with the battered brutal not entirely bogus artistry of Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson. Why not embrace a ballerinas belief in that all too discounted state called ""transcendence"" in that cruely elusive prize ""perfection""?

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Dec. 10 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Thursday Dec. 09 2010 436PM EST Comments AA Country USA Language English Could be an optical illusion but it seems that a flat dull movie shot in 3-D just looks flatter and duller. If you doubt that stick on the glasses and check out The Chronicles of Narnia The Voyage of the Dawn Treader where the vaunted technology acts like a puffy winter coat draped over a string-bean body - all it does is accentuate the thinness. Alas in the third instalment of the C.S. Lewis odyssey the devolution continues with the inexorability of a fairy tale thrust in reverse - the sublime first film morphed into the routine second and now this wispy banality. Michael Apted has taken over the directors chair where check-list in hand he appears content to treat the endeavour like an imposed homework assignment ticking off each accomplished task before snapping shut the book and putting the damn thing behind him. Ho-hum we gotta start with those Pevensie kids back in war-torn England again then sigh find another portal to whisk them off to Narnia. Done the wardrobe used the subway how about that seascape painting in the bedroom? So the painting comes to life and springs a leak floating the kiddies - just Lucy and Edmund now along with their toffee-nosed cousin Eustace - into Narnian seas. Job done I suppose but this portal has all the magic of a burst water main. Already the die of dullness is cast. Anyway our young mariners are scooped up by the good ship Dawn Treader captained by King Caspian himself and off they sail for an episodic bout of island-hopping. One isle boasts nasty slave-traders and a ""green mist"" that disappears its victims into some distant limbo. Another features a geriatric magician a craggy gang of trolls and a ""book of incantations"" where Lewis that slyboots inserts the Christian message that hes always popping into the pagan doings. Here it revolves around the Psalms prayer to ""lead us not into temptation."" Beauty Wealth Power - all tempt the Pevensies with their worldly promises but (spoiler alert) were pretty sure theyll eventually see the light and heed the lion. Meanwhile the last island which happens to be ""the source of all evil"" awaits its vanquishing somewhere in the watery distance. En route seven gold swords must be collected to better slay the monstrous and since the action sequences are dead dreary comic relief must be offered a task double-teamed by the toffee-nosed cousin and Reepicheep the chatty rodent. To that alleged end the boy gets transformed into a boyish dragon while the mouse just keeps on yapping. Yep scratch off another item from the to-do list. Even Tilda Swintons White Witch so regally nefarious in past outings lets us down. Like that lethal mist shes seen only in fuzzy outline here as snowy as an old TV screen - more white-out than witch. As for the climactic battle on that final dark island lets just say that if Apteds intent was to dramatize the banality of evil well kudos. Of course the denouement sees the leonine Aslin a.k.a. the Lord popping up again this time reclining on a pristine beach before a very large and picturesque wave that looms but never breaks - rather like a travel ad for Cancun. Perhaps over-mellowed from the resort setting the Divine One also seems off His game and settles for intoning bland pieties on the order of ""My country lies beyond"" and ""I shall be watching over you."" Sad to report 3-D doesnt do God any favours either - like everything else in this once-magic chronicle He looks wanting in power and unworthy of praise just one more guy going through the motions.

Lewis devotees can discuss the many Christian parallels in The Chronicles of Narnia until the nymphs come home but the series has always been -- for me anyway - a luminous view of childhood as its own secret country. Youngsters in this world enter that one and find themselves transformed into kings and queens heroes and heroines wielders of magic and makers of history. Dismissed as small fry over here over there the Pevensie brood are complex moral creatures who struggle with temptation while crossing swords in the war with evil. Its been a recurring theme throughout the series this mature regard for the inner lives of children. In The Voyage of the Dawn Treader the third and most uneven film adaptation in the series it comes to the fore. We traverse a very different realm this time. For starters the plot unfolds at sea visiting a series of darkly enchanted islands on a quest to collect seven powerful swords and release the outer rim of Narnia from a wicked spell. Second the two older siblings dont make the trip having aged out of the magical questing business. This leaves Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and Lucy (Georgie Henley) to hit the high seas with the handsome-if-vacant King Caspian (Ben Barnes) the valiant rodent Reepicheep and the Pevensies profoundly irritating cousin Eustace (Will Poulter). Ah yes. Eustace. A little of this fellow goes a long way and sadly theres a lot of him. Michael Apted (Amazing Grace) does Poulter no favors by encouraging him to overact; the kid is charismatic and prickly by nature two qualities that worked to nice effect in the delightful Son of Rambow. I loved him in that but I hated Eustace. My son hated Eustace. My sons friend hated Eustace. Everyone must inevitably hate Eustace because hating Eustace at the start sets up an important and redemptive payoff later on. It does get better. He does too (thank Aslan). Dawn Treader is the smallest and most eccentric movie of the three so far introducing peculiar new creatures (monopodal hopping dwarves) and a malevolent green fog that might have oozed out of Lost. Its also the most episodic bouncing from island to island temptation to temptation encountering wizened old ZZ Top look-alikes at every misty stopover. Absent are the thundering armies and whopping computer generated battle sequences that marked the first two films - and turned Lewiss slim economical novels into a visually splendiferous Lord of the Rings-lite. The visual splendor is still there in moderate amounts. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader marks the first three-dimensional entry in the Narnia saga and if it isnt the greatest 3-D - you can tell its an after-the-fact conversion job - well heck at least it looks better than Clash of the Titans. It also boasts a thrashing gnashing slime-covered monstrosity that out-bites the Kraken. Im not sure of its Christian parallels (the snake in the garden maybe) but it clearly personifies the struggles of childhood.

Lewis book series about the magical land of Narnia. ""You are too old"" he tells them explaining why they cannot return to Narnia after this adventure (although readers know the children will be back in the seventh and final installment The Last Battle).Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling was inspired by Lewis and indeed there are many parallels between these two quest series about youths fighting evil in magical worlds. But one striking difference is that Rowling allowed Harry to grow up and bring the baggage that comes with maturing complex emotions while Lewis Narnia remains a gentler world designed for children.Aslan (voiced with quiet grandeur by Liam Neeson) also underscores Lewis strong Christian themes. He reassures the children hell be in their world. He says ""But there I have another name. This was the very reason you were brought to Narnia that by knowing me here for a little you may know me better there.""Appropriately rated PG The Voyage of the Dawn Treader introduces a younger character who will continue the story. That is if this series which was dropped by Disney after the lackluster performance of Prince Caspian in 2008 proceeds; this film was produced by Fox.Lucy and Edmund (still played affectingly by Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes) are visiting their difficult cousin Eustace (a pleasingly pugnacious performance by Will Poulter). A painting of a ship starts pouring water into the room sweeping the children onto the ship sailed by King Caspian of Narnia (Ben Barnes from Prince Caspian).The children help Caspian seek seven lost lords of Narnia and a country at the end of the world. But what the journey is really about is facing and conquering the temptations along the way Lucys desire for a spell that would make her as beautiful as her sister; Edmunds frustration at Caspians dominance; and Eustaces greed for dragon gold.Michael Apteds direction strikes an elegant balance among kid-level scares. Those include a ferocious battle with a frightening sea serpent big concepts such as a glimpse at ""Aslans country"" and its implication of heaven and death and whimsical characters such as the noble fighting mouse Reepicheep (voiced this time by Simon Pegg instead of Eddie Izzard) who helps Eustace in his journey to be a better boy.Despite some rejiggering of the books plot its a film that should please Narnia fans and if it does well may lead to the return of Eustace in the next installment The Silver Chair.

Fox Walden From left Ben Barnes in Fox Waldens ""The Chronicles of Narnia The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" (Fox Walden) In days of yore -- the previous decade -- Harry Potter and a hobbit named Frodo cast a spell on the good citizens of Hollywood. From Silver Lake to the Hills of Beverly besotted executives sold their souls for the movie rights to beloved book series. Any story about a heroic teenager who must decipher or destroy a magical object to save the world from the ultimate evil was greeted as the second coming of ""Star Wars.""But a funny thing happened on the way to the Promised Land. Potential franchises such as ""Eragon"" ""The Seeker"" and ""The Golden Compass"" were abandoned after a single installment. And when the second of the ""Narnia"" films ""Prince Caspian"" was a relative box-office disappointment Disney ended its participation in the planned franchise.The mouse must have smelled the cheese growing moldy. ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" based on the third book in C.S. Lewis Christian allegory is an utter shipwreck a would-be adventure with meager rations of magic and a listless crew. Lucy (Georgie Henley) and Edmund (Skandar Keynes) two of the Pevensie children who defended Narnia in the previous movies are still sequestered from the London blitz when the mythical kingdom calls them again. Through a portal in a painting they are swept out to sea along with their snooty and skeptical cousin Eustace (Will Poulter a pain to behold).Although they are rescued by Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) he doesnt know why theyve been summoned because Narnia is at peace. But when the voyagers learn that a nearby island has been invaded by slave traders they embark on a quest to collect the seven swords of the Lords of Narnia lay them in a pretty pattern on the altar of Aslan and defeat -- you guessed it -- the ultimate evil. In the gooey center of this crock of complications the kids must confront their own temptations and Eustace turns into a dragon yet the British kids are like innocent bystanders in a bloodless video game. Theres no sense of peril to characters we care about the CGI effects are a yawn and veteran director Michael Apted doesnt find a place in this pedestrian tale for any memorable moral lessons. When symbolic lion Aslan (voice of Liam Neeson) makes a final-curtain cameo to tell the kids they cant return to Narnia the only reasonable response is ""Hallelujah"" Find movie showtimes Nov 11 2010 (...)

The Chronicles of Narnia (PG) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Chronicles of Narnia (PG) Third installment in the C.S. Lewis saga continues the downward spiral. Liliandil Lucy Caspian and Edmund hope to defeat the evil forces that have overrun Narnia. (20th Century Fox) Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald12/9/2010 Editor rating 2 The third installment of The Chronicles of Narnia arrives seemingly packed with adventure destined to please audiences that thought (wrongly) that the latest Harry Potter film was too talky. In Voyage of the Dawn Treader treacherous seas slave-trading bandits an evil green mist and a vicious sea monster target and attack the passengers and crew of the noble vessel of Prince Caspian and his men. Swords are unleashed; battles are fought; peril is merely great-ish. So why does the film especially in its first hour feel so slow and banal? Probably for the same reason its predecessors felt like slogs Most of its characters are supremely bland so finding out who comes out on the bad end of a duel simply isnt that interesting. Only two characters are worth much notice; neither is a prince and one is a really big mouse which tells you something sad about Narnias royal family. Luckily there are fewer Pevensies per square inch in this film with ultra-boring Peter and Susan off living in the real world. Their absence leaves younger siblings Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and Lucy (Georgie Henley) to embark on a surprise journey to magical Narnia with an unexpected guest their obnoxious cousin Eustace (Will Poulter) the requisite whiny brat in need of comeuppance. The kids find themselves aboard the Dawn Treader and set off on a quest to find some missing colleagues of the father of Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes pretty but dull). Soon in the way of Lost castaways they find themselves menaced by a mysterious mist. As a villain or terror green mist isnt exactly up there with vampires or Dementors so director Michael Apted has his work cut out for him to make this story even the slightest bit spooky. Besides if you know that this evil mist is going to reveal to you the things you most fear why are you scared when they appear? Still Edmund is paralyzed a time or two by the apparition of Tilda Swinton who haunted him in the series first film and whose more sustained presence could certainly have improved Dawn Treader. The best elements of the film arent its overly obvious Christian message or its dreadful unnecessary 3D an afterthought with no point except to soak audiences with a steeper ticket price. What saves Dawn Treader are the heroic Reepicheep Prince Caspians engaging mouse sidekick and Eustace who regards Reepicheep as his nemesis but whose journey into self-awareness turns out to be genuinely moving. What happens to Eustace is a good reminder that redemption is only powerful if youve got some bad behavior to repent. Otherwise its an empty show no matter how hard you push the allegory.

Photo 20th Century Fox So Aslan says to Hogwarts Ill see your Harry Potter and raise you a ""Pirates of the Car ibbean."" The eye-popping and entertaining ""The Chronicles of Narnia The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" offers a merry seafaring jaunt together with plenty of adventures led by magically empowered kids. Director Michael Apted brings back a sense of the old-fashioned fun of the low-tech 1960s myths-and-monsters matinees when no roiling sea ever failed to harbor a giant serpent -- and men stood in the bows of ships facing peril with chins of iron. The third film in the series finds the two older Pevensie children Susan and Peter grown up and moved on to proper adult jobs during WWII. Teens Lucy (Georgie Hensley) and Edmund (Skandar Keynes) are minding their younger cousin Eustace (Will Poulter an actor who is supposed to be annoying and succeeds perhaps a bit too convincingly). A painting on the wall casts them back into the drink in Narnia where Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) plucks them out of the sea in his spiffy ship the Dawn Treader. Theres a big problem in Narnia these days which is There are no problems. Peace reigns though there are a few details that need to be tidied up involving seven missing lords and an equal number of vanished swords. All of these must be gathered in order to solve the mystery of why some Narnians have vanished in ships that were gobbled up by an evil mist. After a somewhat perfunctory swashbuckling rescue scene on an island where the principals are nearly sold into slavery Apted keeps coming up with grander and grander special-effects showcases involving dragons invisible desperadoes books of magical incantation a fairy from a distant star and much else fantasy to jolly things forth. The story has a tendency to wander into detours but its moral dilemmas run into deeper more fraught territory than youll find in ""Harry Potter."" Lucy battles her own vanity -- a sure way for wickedness to distract her is to turn her mirror image into a vision of the older sister she considers much more beautiful -- while Edmund wrestles with greed and envy growing increasingly angry that Prince Caspian is the boss. The spirit of Aslan the lion (again voiced by Liam Neeson) pops up like Obi-Wan to remind the children of moral imperatives -- as does the White Witch (Tilda Swinton) to coax them into evil. These soul-ripping aspects are sweetened with plenty of comic interludes many of them provided by a capering sailor mouse the size of a terrier Reepicheep (voiced by Simon Pegg) who is forever teaching the obnoxious Eustace a few lessons. Despite all the visual effects the films best aspects are its attention to real-world values; Hogwarts is a little too inebriated with the spirit of Xbox to bother teaching kids to mind their personal character and do the right thing. ""Narnia"" also rings with British history and tradition Not only does the stiff-upper-lip stolidity of WWII Britain give backbone to the children but theres a pre-battle exhortation whose roots are in Agincourt.

Lewiss novels - a franchise some viewers prefer (cover your ears Hogwarts fans) to the Harry Potter pictures. The story Edmund and Lucy Pevensie are swallowed by a painting and plunged into a watery world where the fate of Narnia rests on their confrontations with strange beasties and sundry foes. Starring Ben Barnes Skandar Keynes Georgie Henley William Moseley Anna Popplewell Director Michael Apted Release Opened Dec 10 2010  Editorial Review The lions share of the adventureBy Michael OSullivanFriday December 10 2010Its great to be back in Narnia. If youre anything like the Pevensie children featured in C.S. Lewiss beloved series of fantasy books about siblings who discover a parallel universe - the first three installments of which have now been made into impeccably faithful films - youve been itching to get back there. For readers the saddest thing about Lewiss magical kingdom accessible only through hidden portals was always the fact that the Pevensie children couldnt live there forever and eventually had to return to England. Similarly for filmgoing fans the ""Chronicles of Narnia"" movies (the latest being ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"") cant come along often enough. For them these cinematic visits to Narnia may last only an hour or two but theyre a welcome respite from real life. Directed by Michael Apted (of the ""7 Up"" documentary series) the latest adventure focuses on the youngest two of the four Pevensies Lucy (a pitch-perfect Georgie Henley) and Edmund (Skandar Keynes). While visiting their bratty cousin Eustace (Will Poulter) Lucy and Edmund along with Eustace are swept away quite literally when the waves in a framed painting of the ocean inundate their bedroom with a cascade of splashing seawater. Before they know it theyve been flushed straight out of World War II-era England and onto the deck of a Narnian vessel. Its a fantastic special effect and the ship looks exactly like you would hope it does. Credit the art and production-design folks for doing a whiz-bang job. When Lucy Edmund and Eustace dry off the three find themselves on board the Dawn Treader a ship under the command of Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) the hero of the previous film. Having never been to Narnia Eustace of course is a bit bowled over by his arrival in a land where humans live side by side with talking animals and other mythological beasts. (Tavros one of the Dawn Treaders officers is a minotaur.) One of the greatest characters in all literature - if youre 7 - Reepicheep the swashbuckling mouse is also back (though here hes voiced by Simon Pegg instead of Eddie Izzard). Eustaces sputtering indignation about this strange state of affairs - along with his continued insistence on reporting his abduction to the British consular office - is one of the films funniest running gags. With his perpetually astonished-looking eyebrows Poulter (of ""Son of Rambow"") has a wonderful face for the job. So where is the Dawn Treader heading? And why have Lucy and Edmund been called back? Ever since ""The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe"" the first book and film in the series the children know that they can be summoned back to Narnia only in times of great crisis. Seven Narnian lords it seems have mysteriously gone missing. Only by finding them - or by finding and reuniting their seven missing swords - can Caspian and the children break the spell of evil embodied by a creepy green mist that has descended upon the kingdom since our last visit. As they sail to what turns out to be the edge of the world the children will have to confront their own dark sides. And if all this sounds a little ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows""-ish - horcruxes anyone? - it is. Just remember this C.S. Lewis thought of it first. There is as anyone who has read the books knows a powerful Christian subtext that runs throughout these tales. Its one that the films have never shied away from. The wise and powerful Aslan the lion for instance - a beautifully rendered computer-generated character (voiced by Liam Neeson) who died and was resurrected in the first film and who reappears here - is an obvious Christ figure. Dont worry. Theres nothing quite as heavy-handed as martyrdom here. Still ""Dawn Treader"" does contain strongly religious themes. After all it isnt every kids movie that wrestles with the subject of faith in a higher power or sin or the afterlife. And it isnt every kids film that can do it so entertainingly. Sure thats heavy stuff if youre looking for it. But it doesnt spoil the great great fun to be had in Narnia - or the magical spell it casts - if youre not.Contains scary monsters and and a few battle sequences but no blood.

I dont mean that they were shot in the old 2-D process and simulated into stereoptic form in post-production. I mean that some if not most scenes in movies like Alice in Wonderland and Clash of the Titans and the forthcoming TRON Legacy are not shown in 3-D. A good deal of the time while watching the new Chronicles of Narnia The Voyage of the Dawn Treader you can remove your eye-test specs and see the action with perfect clarity -- greater clarity certainly than if you wore the goggles since they also severely reduce the brightness of the screen. The movies look better and you avoid eyestrain. Youre welcome for that little tip. Another way to avoid ocular distress is to skip Dawn Treader the big-screen adaptation of the third book in C.S. Lewis seven-volume fantasy series about some English children who escape from their midcentury rural reality into a parallel universe. The film is not objectionable just perfunctory -- a decorous succession of adventure cliches with a cast of performers who should seek treatment for charisma deficiency. Dawn Treader the name of the ship in the story should here be rechristened Yawn Treader. If this movie were a bedtime book the wee ones would be asleep by page two. (Video See TIMEs Holiday Movie Preview.) The first two books The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe and Prince Caspian became Disney live-action movies in 2005 and 2008. The two films earned nearly 1.2 billion at the worldwide box office but extravagant costs prodded Disney to ditch the franchise. Fox assumed distribution and the budget was cut from 225 million for Caspian to about 150 million for Dawn Treader. The studios scheme is that profits will come from American evangelicals. Lewis an indifferent believer in his youth returned staunchly to the Church of England in his thirties; the Narnia tales are infused with Christian metaphors (he rejected the word allegory) such as the Jesus-like lion Aslan. Fox has been hoping the faith-based community might buttress the usual fantasy-film demographic of kids and idle teens. Hollywood is not a pious town but Fox executives are praying for a box-office miracle by Sunday. (See the All-TIME Top 100 Novels.) In the first films the four Pevensie children slipped through a closet into Narnia battled the evil White Witch (Tilda Swinton) and met Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) whom they helped reclaim the kingdoms throne from the malefic Miraz. The portal this time is a sea painting which overflows its frame and carries the two younger Pevensies Lucy (Georgie Henley) and Edmund (Skandar Keynes) out to the Dawn Treader along with their outstandingly crabby cousin Eustace (Will Poulter). Caspian having becalmed most of Narnia is bound to locate seven lords banished during Mirazs reign. The prince and his talking-mouse friend Reepicheep (good voice job by Simon Pegg) take the children on this tropical cruise to various islands where they encounter creatures as generic as they are eccentric and where the balky Eustace is transformed into a dragon -- a big improvement in his power usefulness and disposition. The director Michael Apted has just the right c.v. for this job. Hes helmed big-budget adventures (the James Bond film The World Is Not Enough) and an English drama about religion (Amazing Grace). Most pertinently for a film about and for kids Apted is the godfatherly force behind the Seven Up TV documentary series which began in 1964 as a group portrait of seven-year-old schoolchildren and has revisited them as theyve grown up and older every seven years since. (Next year he should be convening the gang for a 56 Up.) What he doesnt impart in Dawn Treader is any dramatic momentum. With each new island visited the story starts from scratch expends its energy and moves on. Midway through the viewer feels like Sisyphus. Good actors would help. Swinton that wild queen of indie films lent a sense of regal danger to Wardrobe and Caspian but shes on screen here for just a few seconds and neither the handsomely Keanuesque but tepid Barnes nor any of the supporting adult actors can fill her pumps. Henley and Keynes the pictures two young stars are no more prepossessing than they were in the earlier episodes. Thats partly a function of their roles -- well-behaved children who havent been asked to rise to fury or holiday in comedy -- but also of the performers vagueness. The newcomer Poulter has a bit more fun being horrid though horrid is all he gets to be for the films first hour. Poulter could ripen into a commanding actor; well see if there are further Narnia films since Eustace is the hero of two later books. As for the religious messages that are supposed to reap a vast audiences of Christian customers theyre like the Waldos of Martin Handfords books you wouldnt know they were there unless you were told to find them. Oh theres a poem about one islands creatures the Dufflepuds who have been made invisible ""Like the h in psychology... the truth in theology."" The holy lion Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson) mixes the gentle wisdom of Jesus with the Old Testament Gods gravitas; but so do Gandalf and Dumbledore from secular literature. And when you hear the line ""We have nothing if not belief"" you are forgiven if you think of Peter Pans Tinker Bell who required the faith of the little ones to restore her to life. For children the first stories they are read can have the impact of religious experiences. They lift kids out of the material world into a realm where their fictional surrogates the young heroes face mortal peril and conquer it; where fallible humans can achieve godlike powers and status; where the authorial gods see that good is rewarded and evil punished. But the telling of these tales demands a fervor a fever to propel the narrative and enrapture the listener. In the Dawn Treader that divine urgency is missing. Young people go on a sea trip and stuff happens in fake 3-D. Thats nothing for audiences devout or Narniagnostic to believe in.

Dawn Treader rides 3-D waves on a shallow sea | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesDawn Treader rides 3-D waves on a shallow seaVoyage of the Dawn Treader has some great 3-D effects. But its likely to appeal only to very young audiences.Georgie Henley in a scene from The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.  (Phil Bray / AP)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainment ReporterThu. Dec. 9 2010 World War II still rages and brother and sister Edmund and Lucy Pevensie have been shuffled off to the relatives to ride out the remainder of it. There they encounter cousin Eustace played by Will Poulter who on an annoyance scale as conceived by the fictional rock band Spinal Tap would be an 11. Hes rude sneering and contemptuously dubious about his cousins stories of visiting Narnia. He quickly realizes theyre not telling tall tales when a picture of a ship on the high seas opens up deluging his bedroom with water and swishing them all away to the mythical land. Soon they are fished out of the drink by the crew of the Dawn Treader and on their way to a new adventure in The Chronicles of Narnia. Oh joy. This time Caspian played once again by Ben Barnes is off in search of seven lords of Narnia who were exiled by his evil uncle Miraz (dispatched in part 2). Caspian -- former prince now king -- has grown some facial hair and ditched the odd vaguely southern-European accent he and other characters had in the previous installment. Hes now speaking like a product of a proper British public school. Edmund and Lucy are no longer the cute youngsters of the first two films in the series although -- unlike older siblings Peter and Susan who appear in brief cameos -- theyre still somehow eligible to enter the magical land of Narnia. Though its the third in the Narnia series of movies based on C.S. Lewiss books The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is the first to use 3-D which its a pleasure to say actually works pretty well lifting the film above the mundane and into the bearable. Still there isnt a whole lot in this film that is likely to appeal to adults in the audience other than the message it conveys without much subtlety to children be good avoid temptation believe in imagination and yada-yada. Despite the livelier pace set by director Michael Apted who takes over from Andrew Adamson theres a sense that beneath the films strong visuals there isnt much real dramatic tension or suspense. Sure there are some nasty slave traders who are quickly brought to heel and a mysterious and menacing green fog that gobbles people up and for reasons unknown another brief appearance by the White Witch from the first two films (although Tilda Swinton is no doubt glad of the paycheque.) Once again Aslan the Lion (still voiced by Liam Neeson) comes in at the end and theres all kinds of soulful hugs and goodbyes ad nauseam. Discerning young people arent likely to find Dawn Treader very challenging or engaging and the accompanying adults are certain to find it pretty bland fare although Dawn Treader will still hold some appeal for very young minds which makes it a safe voyage indeed. The Chronicles of Narnia The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (out of 4) Starring Ben Barnes Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes. Directed by Michael Apted. 112 minutes. At major theatres.

Skandar Keynes and Georgie Henley. (Everett Collection) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday December 9 2010 355 PM Title The Chronicles of Narnia The Voyage of the Dawn Treader Third adventure in C.S. Lewis fantasy series. With Georgie Henley Ben Barnes. Director Michael Apted (155). PG Scary action sequences. At area theaters.Its inevitable the ""Chronicles of Narnia"" films will be compared to a certain other epic series but as ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" reminds us the Pevensie family is always destined to come in second to Harry and Hermione.These days a big-screen franchise needs characters fans can continue to connect with. But unlike J.K. Rowling C.S. Lewis who wrote his novels in the 1950s lacked long-term marketing skills. So now every time we return to Narnia were met with new faces even while scanning the horizon for familiar ones.Hollywood noted this problem when the second Narnia film underperformed. So a big deal has been made about the return of Tilda Swintons villainous White Witch -- but her ghostly barely-there cameo simply leaves us wanting more. The same is true for the older Pevensie siblings who are awkwardly shoved into silly flashbacks.Our real tour guides are little Lucy (Georgie Henley) her big brother Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and their spoiled cousin Eustace (Will Poulter). When Narnia is threatened by an evil force that radiates from a mysterious island the kids -- joined by Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) the mouse Reepicheep (Simon Pegg) and several recent recruits -- must locate and destroy it.Henley is as adorable as ever Poulter is a comic find and Barnes has loosened up considerably since the last installment. The action scenes while not especially striking do have a game energy. But whether you compare this chapter to any ""Harry Potter"" or even to the first majestic ""Narnia"" film its hard to avoid the absences at its core.Neither director Michael Apted nor his three screenwriters connect with the deeply human emotions that propel the best fantasies. Instead theyre required to prioritize generic faith-based messages whose blandness cant be disguised by Liam Neesons emphatic turn as the Christ-like lion Aslan.Kids of course are unlikely to get the religious allusions. All theyll see is a decent family adventure perfectly suited to a cold Saturday morning -- and likely to be forgotten by Sunday.

"Movie review The Chronicles of Narnia The Voyage of the Dawn Treader - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Dawn TreaderMovie review The Chronicles of Narnia The Voyage of the Dawn TreaderThe third film in the series has wonderful moments and delightful characters but overall falters.December 10 2010|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic If you part the roiling seas of ""The Chronicles of Narnia The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" and look beyond the good vs. evil religious allegories ever present in the C.S. Lewis stories you will discover the best thing about the present voyage a a rat and a brat. For fans of the series that means the long tail of Reepicheep is back with Simon Pegg giving excellent voice to the swashbuckling rodent whose rapier wit is as erudite as his swordsmanship is sharp. Though the Reepster will be facing greater foes his biggest challenge is taming Eustace (Will Poulter) the obnoxious young cousin whose family Lucy ( Georgie Henley) and Edmund ( Skandar Keynes) have been forced to bunk with him while the rest of the Pevensie clan is off doing more interesting things. Alas that is not enough to ensure smooth sailing for director Michael Apteds ""Dawn Treader"" which could do with more devils in the details including the 3-D yawn ones. As it is our heroes are forced to battle it out with a Green Mist. See it doesnt even seem scary when its capitalized. As is the case with most fairy tales particularly ones as well loved and well read as Lewis Narnia series you know going in how its all going to turn out but the richness of the story keeps you coming back. Lewis knew enough to stir up much more than mist in ""Dawn Treader"" which is probably why it will be his that we remember. Still on the big screen Narnia continues to be a lovely place for families to visit for a while with its all-knowing lion king Aslan whose reassuring rumble is once again provided by Liam Neeson always promising a better world. The introduction of Eustace and a spirited performance by young Poulter helps. Though the boy is an irritant hes also an avid journal keeper with his entries providing some of the more biting narrative in a film in sore need of it. But as significantly hes the non-believer in the group a nearly as powerful a narrative force as evil for Narnia like Tinkerbell thrives on the notion of childhood belief. Its still wartime England 1943 now and three years since the Pevensie siblings left Caspian ( Ben Barnes) to settle into his kingly role. Susan ( Anna Popplewell) is off in America with the unseen parents while Peter ( William Moseley) is busy with university exams leaving Edmund and Lucy to finish growing up. He tries to join the fighting forces she experiments with flirting both get found out for the children they still are. Most of their days though are spent quarreling with Eustace and in the midst of an argument over the relative worth of fairy tales a you can guess where E stands on that one a they notice the ocean in a painting just above them seems to be spilling over the edge. Before you can say ""Its all make believe or CGI graphics"" theyre submerged in a watery portal to Narnia. It is one of the films best effects and far more difficult for the kids to navigate than the wardrobe of the first film or the subway whoosh of the second. But what has always distinguished the Narnia films is a storybook beauty ethereal in feel a tradition continued here by venerable cinematographer Dante Spinotti known for his high-gloss artistry though usually on far grittier stuff such as 1999s ""The Insider"" or 1997s ""L.A. Confidential."" Apted on the other hand has long been involved in childhood dreams. You can trace it back to the extraordinary British documentary series that started with 1964s ""Seven Up"" looking at the lives of seven British kids. Apted began as a researcher but was soon directing the follow-ups over the years to see how things turned out. His best narrative films tend toward the uplifting sort as well ""Gorillas in the Mist"" and ""Coal Miners Daughter"" among them which would seem a good match for Narnia. But the script he is working with for ""Dawn Treader"" from Christopher Markus and Stephen McFreely who wrote the first two Narnias with Michael Petroni joining in for the third ultimately fails. Oh there are sword fights aplenty (as bloodless as ever) but instead of a real story we are left clinging to individual moments. There are funny ones a the one-footed dwarfs (big foot tiny bodies lots of hopping); poignant ones a the magic dragon desperate to undo the spell; sort of scary ones a a ghastly sea serpent whose belly is the beast; and flat ones (too many to mention). What you wont find is nearly enough tension as our heroes try to beat back the mist and (theres always an ""and"" in Narnia) recover the seven swords of the seven loyal lords whove somehow disappeared along with the mystical sprawling adventure ""Dawn Treader"" should be. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com The Chronicles of Narnia The Voyage of the Dawn Treader MPAA rating PG for some frightening images and sequences of fantasy action Running time 1 hour 55 minutes Playing In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESProducers hope Dawn Treader has magic of first Narnia...December 3 2010List Holiday SneaksOctober 31 2010A dark PrinceMay 16 2008Darkness falls on NarniaMay 4 2008Will this Lion roar?November 6 2005MORE STORIES ABOUTDawn TreaderCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-narnia-20101210,0,2112145.story",200,thechroniclesofnarniathevoyageofthedawntreader16,thechroniclesofnarniathevoyageofthedawntreader,latimes

C.S. Lewis ""Narnia"" novels merged that fantasy Christian allegory and high adventure in a recipe that has enchanted generations of readers -- and now moviegoers. This third installment from the childrens series ""The Chronicles of Narnia The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" follows the two younger Pevensie siblings back to the magical land of Narnia with their bratty cousin Eustace. And this time after his disappointing absence in 2008s ""Prince Caspian"" the fables lion king/messiah Aslan makes a roaring return. Old Brown Eyes is back. The film is a throwback to colorful wholesome adventures like ""The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad"" and ""Swiss Family Robinson"" with rollicking adolescent derring-do scary (not terrifying) monsters and adorable animal sidekicks. In the capable hands of director Michael Apted (who gave us ""Coal Miners Daughter"" ""Gorillas in the Mist"" and the James Bond feature ""The World Is Not Enough"") a potentially syrupy allegory becomes razzle-dazzle childrens entertainment with the religious dimensions gracefully conveyed. The story opens in World War II-era London as Lucy (Georgie Henley) and Edmund (Skandar Keynes) living in their uncles home yearn for old friends and adventure in the otherworldly kingdom. Who can blame them with their snotty younger cousin (Will Poulter) spying and snitching on them? Eustace doesnt believe in faith and fairy tales. He spends his time reading as he sneers ""books with facts."" He isnt actually wearing a sign on his back saying ""Kick me Im an atheist"" but he might as well be. Poulter gives the story a needed jolt of conflict and comedy; his performance as the petulant cowardly blowhard is wicked good. Hes delightfully annoying. Returning to Narnia through the portal of an enchanted painting the three find themselves aboard the royal galleon Dawn Treader with King Caspian (swoony Ben Barnes now with a regal goatee and without his odd exotic accent) and the swashbuckling mouse Reepicheep. Their expedition to rescue missing lords and collect mystic swords will lead to encounters with a book that conjures magic spells a shining star in human form a titanic sea monster and the dread White Witch (the always-extraterrestrial Tilda Swinton in a brief scary cameo). Lewis fable with fauns and dragons and dwarves and Arabian Nights exoticism all jumbled together doesnt make tons of cosmological sense but its undeniably fun. THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER  OUT OF FOUR STARS Rating PG for some frightening images and sequences of fantasy action. On their journey each of the children faces temptation confronts inner demons and experiences a transformative rebirth. The tone is much lighter than in ""Prince Caspian"" with its dark intense combat sequences and so is the look. ""Dawn Treader"" is suffused with radiant South Seas light. There are scores of hectic high-spirited kid-friendly battle scenes where nary a drop of blood is shed. Theres a lot of plot to shoehorn into 115 minutes and the pace feels breathless but thats probably fine with the young target audience. Lewis purists will grouse about ""Dawn Treaders"" emphasis on sea serpents dragons tentacles of evil green mist and one-legged dwarves over the subtler moral battles against temptation but thats the price of getting a movie bankrolled in mammon-worshiping Hollywood. ccovertstartribune.com  612-673-7186 View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Chronicles of Narnia The Voyage of the Dawn Treader  (out of four)Stars Ben Barnes Georgie Henley Skandar Keynes Will Poulter Tilda Swinton Liam NeesonDirector Michael AptedDistributor 20th Century FoxRating PG for some frightening images and sequences of fantasy actionRunning time 1 hour 52 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The Chronicles of Narnia The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is more like The Voyage of the Dull Treacle. Its serviceable but certainly not much fun. This third in the series of C.S. Lewis beloved books is the least involving of the three despite the noble attempts of Ben Barnes. The young actor returns as the dashing Prince Caspian who was introduced in the second installment. Hes the liveliest of the cast who mostly seem to give lackadaisical performances. SERIES FATE Reaction will determine if film voyage continues The seafaring story lacks narrative flow. Events seem arbitrary characters incidental. Action scenes are slapped together as if they exist only to provide a framework for the special effects which are nothing very special. There is no discernible advantage to seeing this wannabe swashbuckling saga in 3-D. World War II rages in Europe as the two younger Pevensie children Lucy (Georgie Hensley) and Edmund (Skandar Keynes) are left in the care of an aunt and uncle in England while their parents have taken their older brother and sister Peter and Susan off to America. But no matter little time is spent on the shores of any known country. As Lucy and Edmund ponder a bland-looking seascape framed on the wall of their relatives home their obnoxious cousin Eustace (Will Poulter) enters and taunts them. In the most exciting scene of the film the three are suddenly inundated by stormy seas while standing in the sturdy room transported onto the ship in the painting. Its a Narnian vessel piloted oh so fortuitously by their old buddy Caspian and a crew of interchangeable sailors. Once on the high seas their adventure barely treads water. Too much time is wasted on establishing Eustaces surly unpleasantness. Poulter seems to be aping an elderly vaudevillian playing an annoying kid. He goes from snotty-nosed brat to fiery-snouted dragon and proves more likable as a gargantuan monster. This tale lacks the woodsy enchantment of the first Narnian adventure with its menagerie of anthropomorphized animals. The kids spend much of their time aboard the Dawn Treader a tall ship with a dragon head at the stern where they are bossed around by a warrior mouse named Reepicheep (Simon Pegg). They are propelled into a mission that involves traveling to distant islands gathering seven swords from missing Narnian lords and delivering them to the kindly leonine Aslan (Liam Neeson.) The mission is haphazard. The fate of Narnia is threatened but the reasons are vague gaining little clarity as the movie progresses. While all three must confront their greatest temptations these challenges are easily faced downsince a parade of scenes presents a revolving door of perilous situations without the appropriate mounting tension. Its not surprising that Disney dropped the Narnia franchise after box-office sales for the second movie Prince Caspian dropped dramatically. The first 2005s Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe was the most enthralling capturing Lewis whimsy and transporting viewers to a visually arresting fantasy world. In contrast a voyage on the Dawn Treader is a trip hardly worth taking. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Standards Editor Brent Jones.

Lewis fantasy series. Maybe its the postproduction 3-D enhancements but in this effects-laden Odyssey for tweens sometimes humans and beasts seem more wax-and-paint than flesh-and-blood.The saga directed by Michael Apted focuses on the younger two Pevensie siblings Lucy and Edmund (who discover the faraway kingdom of Narnia in The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe and help Prince Caspian reclaim the Narnian throne in Prince Caspian). Essentially they are prisoners of war. As World War II rages and their parents are abroad with their elder siblings Lucy (spirited Georgie Henley) and Edmund (earnest Skandar Keynes) are confined to their uncles home in Cambridge England. Pretty boring for youths who a year earlier liberated Narnia. Even worse their whimpering cousin cant stop needling them.Eustace (Will Poulter of the underknown Son of Rambow) the irritating cousin takes verbal aim at that make-believe place they natter so much about. Before they can defend themselves from their weaselly relative the waves in a maritime painting on the wall spill into the playroom and sweep all three of them back into its ocean. Immediately they are whisked onto the Dawn Treader a caravel captained by Prince Caspian (the dull if handsome Ben Barnes) and mouse-warrior Reepicheep (voice of Simon Pegg).The courageous Pevensies and cowardly Eustace think they are helping Prince Caspian in his quasi-Arthurian quasi-Odyssean quest to reunite lost swords and reawaken missing lords. But as the young heroes do so each faces an immobilizing personal challenge and finds a means of mastering it. For Lucy its vanity and pride; for Edmund its envy; for Eustace its pretty much all the seven deadly sins. As the youngsters rise to the occasion they are rooted on by Aslan (voice of Liam Neeson) the Christ-like lion.Unfortunately between its ripsnorting beginning and moving finale Apteds film sails into the doldrums. One need not have familiarity with the source material to understand whats going on (as one requires knowledge of Horcruxes etc. to parse whats happening in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows).But while Apted (versatile director of Coal Miners Daughter and The World Is Not Enough) gets focused and affecting performances from his young actors their excellent work gets upstaged by the clutter of computer-generated imagery imperfectly integrated into the overall vision. Apted deftly handles the elements of Christian allegory; its those infernal digital effects that prove to be beyond his capacity.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Lewiss classic fantasy novels. The two youngest Pevensie children (Skandar Keynes Georgie Henley) and their peevish cousin (Will Poulter outstanding) are pulled into the mystical realm of Narnia to recover seven enchanted swords. The beguiling creature design--from minotaur to dragon sea serpent to one-footed dwarf--and 3D effects heighten the illusion of a storybook coming alive while the rousing sea adventure drives home Lewiss Christian ethos better than either of the previous entries.

The Voyage of the Dawn Treader doesnt even have funny dufflepuds. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 9 2010 306 PM Duffledud The new Narnia movie doesnt revive the magical franchise. By John Swansburg The Chronicles of Narnia The Voyage of the Dawn Treader This is a dark hour for Narnia children. The threat comes not from the fearsome giants of the North or the warlike Telmarines. As Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) explains at the outset of The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (20th Century Fox) those foes have been subdued and there is peace in the kingdom. The villain in this tale the third in the Chronicles of Narnia series is the menacing horde known as the Moviegoing Public without whose tribute no movie franchise can long survive. The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005) was a hit grossing 745 million worldwide. But its sequel Prince Caspian (2008) cost more to make and earned far less (419 million) prompting Walt Disney Studios to abandon Narnia. Apparently not even a sequel starring a talking mouse could persuade them to bury their faces in Aslans mane one more time. John Swansburg John Swansburg is Slates deputy editor. Fox has ridden to the franchises rescue and together with Walden Media brings us Dawn Treader sporting a tighter budget and a higher ticket price thanks to the introduction of 3-D effects. The film will need both of these assets to claw its way to profitability. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is among the most beloved of the seven books in C.S. Lewis series but its also one of the trickiest to adapt for the screen. Advertisement When the movies first arrived much was made of how Walden a production company with evangelical ties would handle the Christian allegory at the heart of the Chronicles. The more pressing issue for director Michael Apted (of the acclaimed Up series new to Narnia) is how to squeeze a blockbuster out of Dawn Treader a tale in which Lewis is at his most Oxford donnish. The first two Narnia books narrate mortal struggles of good versus evil. The third is the story of a poky pilgrimage infused with elements of The Faerie Queene and the King James Bible. I wish I could say the movie has risen to the challenge. Alas its attempts to overcome the storys episodic nature are clumsy its effects only intermittently special and its dufflepuds not nearly funny enough. The dufflepuds--one-legged dunderheaded dwarfs looked after by an exiled magician--are Lewis comic riff on Caliban. In the book theyre hilarious. When we last left Narnia Aslan the realms combination Lion King/Christ figure had just explained to Peter and Susan the elder two Pevensie children that theyd made their final visit to his kingdom. (Narnia is a land of talking beasts and wicked witches but it is not a land of training bras--by the end of Prince Caspian Susan had started to attract glances from the dauphin that bordered dangerously on the PG-13.) Dawn Treader features the younger two Pevensies Edmund (Skander Keynes) and Lucy (Georgie Henley) as well as their cousin Eustace Scrubb (Will Poulter excellent)--a peevish punctilious little blighter in dire need of a fantastical adventure to untwist his knickers. In one of the movies best effects--drawn from a somewhat perfunctory passage in Lewis book--the three children are summoned to Narnia through a magical painting a seascape that suddenly comes to life filling a London flat with Narnian brine. Rescued from the deep by their old friend Caspian the children are brought aboard his ship the titular Dawn Treader. There the prince explains that hes on a journey to discover the fates of seven lords who fled Narnia after his father was murdered by the usurper Miraz. Edmund and Lucy veterans of this enchanted world happily sign on for whatever excitement awaits them on its high seas. Eustace meanwhile scowls and complains and is caught bogarting provisions from the hold by the valiant mouse Reepicheep (a CGI creation voiced with aplomb by Simon Pegg). What follows are a series of adventures across several islands each of which tests the mettle though more often the character of our pilgrims. Caspian and Edmund learn a lesson about greed when they discover a pond that has the Midas touch Lucy about vanity when she casts a spell to make herself as beautiful as her older sister. Even Eustace becomes less of a wet blanket after he is transformed into a dragon and called upon to help the Dawn Treader battle a ghastly your-kid-will-have-nightmares sea serpent. The movie should have been content to spin these tales of moral progress and send the audience back into the street eagerly debating which stalwart of the British screen would bring appropriate gravitas to the role of Puddleglum the marsh-wiggle in part 4 The Silver Chair. Instead in an effort to give our heroes some higher duty the screenwriters introduce a confusing wrinkle Caspian and company must locate and unite seven swords lest a strange green gaseous evil be loosed throughout Narnia. This unwanted dash of Tolkien-esque questing does little to move the story along. It also lends the movie a sense of foreboding that doesnt befit Lewis cheery tale. If only the makers of Dawn Treader had learned the lesson Lucy does when she casts that forbidden spell Dont try to be something youre not. Like Slate on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The problem with adapting C.S. Lewis The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader to film is that its a relatively shapeless book an episodic quest inspired by traditional Irish fables but lacking the through-line of Lewis other six books about the magical land of Narnia. Director Michael Apted and his screenwriting team solve this problem by grafting a videogame quest-plot onto the story. In The Chronicles Of Narnia The Voyage Of The Dawn Treader the characters have to find seven lost magical swords and place them on a magical table to save the world from the generically evil threat of Dark Island. The plot additions give the story some stakes and a heaping helping of extra conflict but theyre poorly planned described and detailed. They essentially replace the books blank spaces with gaping plot holes and laughable cliches. The bland cast from the first two entries The Lion The Witch And The Wardrobe and Prince Caspian return in Dawn Treader as siblings Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes are again drawn into Narnia along with their huffy arrogant cousin Will Poulter. Theyre quickly roped into the sword-quest via a sea voyage laden with special effects slapstick and swordplay. Where the first two installments seemed to be trying for a training-wheels version of the Lord Of The Rings movies this installment is more junior-grade Pirates Of The Caribbean with cheaper special effects and a wholesome edge rather than a ribald one. The story bounces from island to island and event to event with a sense of humor but no sense of flow or drama except during the fight sequences. The problem is largely that Dawn Treader approaches fantasy as if the details dont matter--for instance what Dark Island is why it kidnaps generic islanders why it makes nightmares real (enabling a ""Dont think about your fears or theyll become real"" scene straight out of Ghostbusters) or what the magic swords have to do with anything. Its apparently enough that theres a clearly defined goal some brave people pointed toward it some CGI monsters to spice things up and some inessential-but-serviceable 3-D for immersions sake. But that approach feels depressingly lazy. The story is based in Lewis fervent Christian beliefs but this adaptation feels mighty soulless.

Theyre swept up in a wave of brine cascading from a painting in their Cambridge home to be reunited with Prince now King Caspian (Ben Barnes) and mouse Reepicheep aboard retro Elizabethan galleon The Dawn Treader. Island-hopping incarceration battles with ghosts Barbary-style slave traders and the temptations of magician Coriakins enabling spells all ensue in the royal partys quest for Narnian peace. Its an episodic progression richly kinetically rendered by new director Michael Apted - but one lacking real momentum or in its widened group of heroes stable identification figures. And whereas Andrew Adamson (director of the first two films) had an affectionate take on the kids antiquated manners Apteds approach is more self-conscious - such that Henley and Keyness youthful heroism appears more naive or to be mere posturing. Likewise as the film goes on Apted is more mesmerised and swamped by the films 3D and other visual effects which coarsens the charm and invites negative comparison with the grandeur of those provided by its Potter or Ring rivals. That said this Narnia provides rousing enough young family entertainment - though theres less to engage maturer Lewis fans and possible disappointment for older teenagers.

Essentially I lived and breathed Narnia. When the first film came out I was very pleased with the result that modern technology could provide the fantastical elements of the film. The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe really captured the essence of the story but by the time the second came out it was clear that the book had been thrown out the window and flying in came Hollywood and the pressures no doubt of an American audience. (Of course for instance Susan will suddenly have a thing with Caspian RIGHT AT THE END) likewise The Voyage of the Dawn Treader stank of Hollywood of creative sacrifice and money guzzling investors who think they know something about movies. Now I know that it is always a difficult thing to transfer the essence of a book onto screen but this film was a real failure. Sure I enjoyed it but I wont treasure it. (Also for gods sake 3D? Does every film HAVE to be 3D now?)FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 16 2010EvieFeaturedIt wouldnt feel like Christmas if there wasnt a new Narnia film to watch. Without the epic battles scenes or any moment as iconic as little Lucy crying over Aslans dead body blub this third film feels the least Narnian somehow.

Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; chronicles-of-narnia-the-the-voyage-of-the-dawn-treader ) Chronicles of Narnia The The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (United States 2010) December 07 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli The Chronicles of Narnia The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is fantasy-lite. With its PG rating and aversion to anything shocking or overly grotesque its the bastard stepchild of The Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter. A dull meandering storyline and visuals all-but destroyed by a second-rate 3-D conversion make this movie inferior to its predecessors The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe and Prince Caspian. The ""quest"" element a common fantasy staple is uninspired and perfunctory and theres a growing sense throughout the movie that theres no real point to any of what is occurring. This isnt much a problem in C.S. Lewis source novel an allegorical childrens fable about faith and the fantastical but it does not translate well to a motion picture. In 2005 following the success of The Lord of the Rings and the early Harry Potter films Disney decided they wanted their own fantasy franchise. Instead of choosing something newer and edgier they went with C.S. Lewis The Chronicles of Narnia a lightweight in the genre but one that could deliver two key demographics younger children and church-going Christians. The latter group was specifically targeted because of Lewis religious reputation and his admission that his beloved books were Christian allegories. However after the success of The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe enthusiasm dried up for Prince Caspian. Disney disappointed by the box office returns of the second installment and concerned that the lack of a narrative drive in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader could make it unpopular bailed on the series. 20th Century Fox replaced Disney as Walden Medias partner in the venture but this could be a one-film deal. Unless The Voyage of the Dawn Treader does better in multiplexes than is currently predicted Narnias live-action feature films will stall at three. (The series contains seven books although two are outside the main chronology.) The Last Battle will probably never reach the screen which is disappointing since it would have been interesting to see how the filmmakers might have handled an apocalyptic story that is essentially unfilmable. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader begins as the previous installments did in our world with England enmeshed in World War II. The two younger Pevensie children Lucy (Georgie Henley) and Edmund (Skandar Keynes) have gone to live with their cousin Eustace Scrubb (Will Poulter). Its at the Scrubb house while gazing at a painting of a ship that the three children are magically transported to Narnia. For Lucy and Edmund this is their third visit. For the skeptical and self-centered Eustace its his inaugural journey to the fantasy world so beloved by his relatives. Caspian (Ben Barnes) once prince and now king is on hand to pull the three children from the sea. They find themselves voyaging on The Dawn Treader the pride of Narnias fleet. The king is on a mission to discover the whereabouts of seven lords and seven swords that have gone missing. The ship has set off to explore the Eastern Seas beyond the Lone Islands and possibly even discover Aslans Country. In an attempt to bring some structure to the narrative the movie occasionally departs in significant ways from the book. In fact arguably the most energetic element of the movie - a lengthy battle with a gigantic sea serpent - has been contrived for the screen. Still even with the quest sharpened (the seven swords when gathered and placed on Aslans Table can shift the balance from evil to good and free the prisoners of The Dark Island) The Voyage of the Dawn Treader meanders. The trek demands nearly two hours but its hard to argue that the destination is worth the time investment. Character development is perfunctory. Theres an irony here; director Michael Apted is best known for his Up Series of movies cinematic records of the lives of a group of British men and women over 42 years (and counting). As such Apted is the author of arguably the greatest documentary character study ever committed to film. One would expect more vivid - or at least interesting - personalities to emerge even from a fictional endeavor. However despite this being the third time viewers have traveled alongside Lucy and Edmund they fail to stand out as memorable or remarkable. A similar complaint can be made about Caspian although this is only his second movie. Eustace is a generic brat. The two most compelling individuals are brought to life by special effects the swashbuckling mouse Reepicheep (whose voice is provided by Simon Pegg) and Eustace the Dragon. Once the boy has become a monster he carries the tragedy of his circumstances like a mantle and its touching to see the dragons tears. More than in either of the previous movies Lewis Christian philosophy is evident. The main theme is about faith and Aslans role as a Christ figure is brought out of the subtext when the Lion acknowledges that he exists in the real world but is called by another name. Lucy and Edmund he advises should come to know him there in his other guise. Excepting The Last Battle its possible to read the books and not think of the theology as being heavy-handed. Yet thats precisely how it feels in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. The productions special effects are generally strong and some shots have the potential to be quite beautiful. The dragon for example is impressive as is the giant sea serpent that harries the ship during the climax. Unfortunately the 3-D is so bad that it muddies a lot of whats on screen. Having experienced the first ten minutes in both 2-D and 3-D I can comment with authority that the 2-D version is superior in every way sharper brighter and more colorful. The 3-D adds little except a surcharge while detracting from the experience as a whole. Its not quite as bad as Clash of the Titans and The Last Airbender but its close. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader features some odd shifts in tone. A sequence involving a group of invisible creatures feels like it was lifted from an unproduced Monty Python movie. Eustaces character arc contains elements of pathos. And theres sadness at the end when the finality of certain farewells is made clear. Throughout the movie many common fantasy elements are present including a dungeon and a dragon but the essential simplicity and lack of ambition make The Voyage of the Dawn Treader an unremarkable and somewhat boring trip.

Heck theyve come a long way since ""Jurassic Park."" Fantastical worlds previously confined to the imagination are now routinely rendered on giant screens with hair-tingling surround sound and state-of-the-art 3-D. The Chronicles of Narnia The Voyage of the Dawn Treader Director Michael Apted. Cast Georgie Henley Skandar Keynes Ben Barnes voice of Simon Pegg. Rating PG for frightening images and fantasy action. Great Good Fair Bad Bomb On the other hand technology is still useless at solving problems of narrative including the always delicate art of condensing a book into a two-hour drama - even a short straightforward book like ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" third in C.S. Lewis childrens fantasy heptalogy (and Christian allegory) ""The Chronicles of Narnia."" True to its folkloric roots the book is an episodic adventure story with episodes bound together more by tone theme and character than by plot. Thats exactly the sort of thing that doesnt work in a movie and so the adapters at Walden Media attempt to raise the stakes with a tacked-on epic quest - something to do with a Vague and Terrible Evil brewing somewhere at sea which the audience will promptly forget all about until it becomes a giant sea serpent with many menacing appendages in a climactic battle that is visually overwhelming and dramatically inert. (One almost expects to hear Liam Neesons booming voice crying ""Unleash the kraken"" except that would be confusing because he also plays the voice of the lion king Aslan.) Fans of the books will enjoy spending a couple of hours inside Lewis imagination. Certainly Reepicheep the swashbuckling mouse whose wit is as sharp as his undersized sword is fun to watch. But the best thing about the film is neither the top-notch CGI nor the shallow moral lessons but the performance of Will Poulter (""Son of Rambow"") as Lucy and Edmunds insufferable cousin Eustace Scrubb. Convincing both in his arrogance and in his reversal he gives this ""Voyage"" the one thing that the best digital technology never can a human heart.

Lewis magical kingdom of Narnia finds the intrepid Pevensie kids Lucy (Georgie Henley) and Edmund (Skandar Keynes) sailing with Prince-turned-King Caspian (Ben Barnes) on the Narnian ship the Dawn Treader. Theyre manning what is essentially a floating goodwill embassy/fighting machine populated by gnarly human sailors talking animal sailors and gnarly talking half-human half-animal sailors. Evil is everywhere -- I mean EEE-VILL as Narnians pronounce it with a Princess Bride flourish. But the light of goodness and thespiritual influence of the sanctified lion Aslan guide Lucy and Edmund. Aslan even has a salutary effect on their priggish cousin Eustace (Will Poulter) a refreshingly horrid little bourgeois British pill unwillingly brought along for the journey. Its only after Eustace survives being turned into a dragon and especially after he learns humility at the paws of the King of the Beasts that the lad embraces the world with new compassion and grace. He is then one might say reborn. Mini-homilies flow like the seas in The Chronicles of Narnia The Voyage of the Dawn Treader ""We have nothing if not belief."" ""Be strong -- dont fall to temptation."" ""You doubt your value; dont run from who you are."" Thats to be expected Lewis embedded his engrossing popular fantasies with child-size lessons in virtue served with an overlay of Christian allegory for those who wish to seek it. Whats less expected is that the movie directed by Michael Apted (taking over from a more sprightly fantasy-savvy Andrew Adamson who handled the first two along with the first two Shreks) looks and feels so wooden so cheesy. The Narnians are mad busy. Theyre searching for the seven lost lords of Narnia battling adversaries (including a humongous sea serpent) and rescuing fellow kingdom dwellers who have been captured by a slave trader. But little in this production feels either grand and substantial or on the other hand light and fun. Theres a businesslike barrel-ahead determination to the proceedings as if the players (and in the bigger picture the producers) were ticking off items on an agenda three volumes down four to go if Walden Media commits to the whole shebang. The action sequences are full of dutifully tricky chessboard fighting lunges and sword swings; the talking special-effects mouse Reepicheep (previously voiced by Eddie Izzard now by Simon Pegg) talks a lot. In the thick of a good-and-evil showdown Tilda Swinton appears for a total of five seconds as the White Witch from the first movie. Theres nothing thats not by the book the clock the CGI program. And that includes the option of watching The Voyage of the Dawn Treader in undistinguished unnecessary 3-D. Im more and more frustrated these days by movies that sell the 3-D movie experience as a kind of turbo-charged event yet the greatest extra we see through plastic movie-theater goggles is the ""dimensionality"" of a sword or a boot or the imaginary fur on a CGI mouse. Im confounded by the fact that aside from the Pevensie siblings and their nicely obnoxious cousin absolutely everything and everyone aboard the Dawn Treader looks one-dimensional no matter how closely I peer through special specs. Could it be that EEE-VILL is the force behind all this blandness? Help us Aslan C See all of this weeks reviews Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

Valiantly attempting to relaunch Walden Medias ""Chronicles of Narnia"" Fox has hitched itself to one leaky vessel with ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader."" Taking a faith-based sledgehammer to C.S. Lewis enchanting source novel this f/x-heavy third adaptation of the Christian-themed fantasy series feels routine and risk-averse in every respect as if investment anxiety had fatally hobbled its sense of wonder. Public goodwill toward the ""Narnia"" name 3D ticket premiums and a well-timed December release could spell friendly B.O. winds initially but this creatively downsized entry doesnt feel like a franchise high-water mark commercially or artistically. When Disney pulled out after 2008s ""Prince Caspian"" (which earned 415 million worldwide but fell short of ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobes"" staggering 745 million haul) it fell to Fox to keep ""Narnia"" afloat through its marketing/distribution pact with Walden. Industry eyes will be on ""Dawn Treader"" through the holidays and beyond and its performance will surely be a crucial determining factor in the direction of the four remaining films. Next up presumably is ""The Silver Chair"" (the seeds of which are planted here in a throwaway line). Rightly beloved by generations of readers young and old faithful and secular Lewis seven-volume cycle was always a tricky bigscreen proposition. None of ""Wardrobes"" six sequels can match it for name recognition and classic appeal and because the stories are all self-contained written out of chronological sequence and centered around a shifting gallery of protagonists the series overall lacks the sustaining narrative urgency and continuity of such gold-standard movie franchises as ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Harry Potter."" A particular reader favorite ""Dawn Treader"" itself posed unique challenges to adaptation A long seafaring adventure with a vague narrative thrust and no major villain the story is gentle in spirit episodic in structure and richly invested in character-driven themes of wisdom and maturity prevailing over temptation and pride. The films principal flaw is that it views this as a condition to be remedied rather than a quality to be embraced. Scribes Christopher Markus Stephen McFeely and ""Narnia"" newbie Michael Petroni have attempted to up the stakes by tacking on a dull ""Rings""-like fantasy quest as well as a climactic sea-monster battle that smacks of ""Pirates of the Caribbean."" Against the backdrop of mid-WWII England the two youngest Pevensie children Lucy (Georgie Henley) and Edmund (Skandar Keynes) are sent to stay with relatives namely their loathsome cousin Eustace (Will Poulter). An insolent brat without a speck of imagination Eustace gets a much-needed attitude adjustment when he Lucy and Edmund are magically swept into a painting and deposited in the middle of the ocean where they are rescued by the golden ship of the films title. While Eustace splutters indignantly and makes an immediate enemy of dashing mouse Reepicheep (voiced by Simon Pegg) Lucy and Edmund are thrilled to be reunited aboard the Dawn Treader with their friend Caspian (Ben Barnes) now king of Narnia. Caspian and his crew of men and talking beasts have set sail for the distant Lone Islands in search of the swords of seven presumed-dead Narnian lords -- their only chance of vanquishing a nameless evil that manifests itself as billowing green smoke an unfortunate effect that suggests an excess of beans in the cargo hold. Far more emphatically than in the novel Lucy Edmund and especially Eustace must endure tough tests of character aided by occasional benevolent interventions from the great lion Aslan (once again speaking in the regal purr of Liam Neeson). Rather than weaving these moral quandaries into an adventure thats compelling on its own terms the script foregrounds them like Sunday school illustrations in which the word ""faith"" is frequently invoked but never once examined. Inspiring retroactive appreciation for Andrew Adamsons earnest but entirely respectable helming on the first two films Michael Apteds workmanlike direction suggests a singular lack of interest in the mythic world hes showing us. The oceanic backdrop and island visitations offered an opportunity to broaden Narnias visual horizons (pic was lensed in Queensland Australia) but ""Dawn Treader"" looks hastily executed relying on excessive over-the-mast shots to convey a sweeping sense of grandeur. Result is a picture that in its gaudy vfx substandard 3D and homily-like sense of drama feels straitjacketed by its mandate to deliver a Christian-targeted mainstream-friendly entertainment (all on a budget and production schedule reportedly far tighter than ""Prince Caspians""). Doing their part to maintain audience connection to the core characters are Henley and Keynes both good at conveying the sly sense of mischief that keeps Lucy and Edmund recognizably human while Poulter (""Son of Rambow"") makes a delightfully impudent Eustace who undergoes the storys most profound transformation literally and figuratively. Crucial to the success of this emotional passage is Peggs droll affectionate voicework as Reepicheep (taking over for Eddie Izzard) at once utterly rodentlike and richly human emerging as one of the few aspects of this ""Voyage"" that feels true to Lewis conception.

Lewiss seven-volume () Chronicles of Narnia comes underwritten by a new studio 20th Century Fox and with a new director Michael Apted working from one of the best-loved of Lewiss books.In contrast to the Blitz opening The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe RAF planes now control British airspace in Voyage of the Dawn Treader. The war has ground on and Edmund and Lucy (Skandar Keynes and Georgie Henley) the two youngest Pevensie children are considerably grown up separated from their siblings and sequestered with an aunt in Cambridge where they share a house with awful cousin Eustace Clarence Scrubb (Will Poulter with a piggy nose and ""Whats-that-smell?"" expression) who mocks their talk of make-believe Narnia.Scarcely has the scene been set when an ajar portal between worlds gobbles the children up. Eustaces unbelief washes away as they surface in aquamarine waters off the bow of the Narnian Navys good ship Dawn Treader. Aboard Edmund and Lucy are reunited with Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) and Reepicheep the ankle-gouging mouse-musketeer (now voiced by Simon Pegg) to the good cheer of all except Eustace who sets about doing his best impression of insufferable Freddie Bartholomew in Captains Courageous.The Treader is plotting a course through the unknown Eastern Seas to Worlds End on a mission to collect seven swords from seven Lords on who-knows-how-many islands. This is all to stop up malevolent forces emanating from the ""Dark Isle"" a noxious cloud that has been swallowing up Narnian subjects. This threat is the screenwriters invention--Lewiss Kings and Queens need no more reason to go questing than a bird to sing--as is the films battle royale conclusion though there is considerably less bombast added than might be expected and some of the fuddling with the text is actually to the films credit The minor point Lewis made of Lucys covetousness of her elder sisters beauty becomes the premise for two absorbingly imagined scenes of tempted vanity.The Narnia films have each come with a distinct visual identity ice thawing into vivid heraldic colors in Wardrobe; the gloom of 16th-century Spanish court in Prince Caspian. Much of the same production design crew returns on Dawn Treader outfitting the Viking longship in Art Nouveau trappings including curvilinear handrails and stained-glass forecastle windows that survive a sea monster. Its good to see the spirit of English craftsmanship alive even if applied to ephemeral effects.The great cameraman Dante Spinotti--Michael Manns go-to--shot Dawn Treader and he must share credit with a legion of technicians for the sumptuousness of this episode for panoramic shots that take in cosmos and glittering sea the cliffs of Paradise and the headlands of Hell. A faerie luminous and curling with dry-ice smoke presenting a lapidary glow-in-the-dark feast table is an image Maxfield Parrish might not be ashamed of. Likewise the landing boat parting a sea of lilies--anyone afraid to find Lewiss faith in their popcorn will be appalled at what lies beyond but you really should calm down. Dawn Treader will be projected in 3-D which didnt seem to add anything gobsmacking aside from glittery air bubbles in some striking underwater shots. (For further research Can you build up immunity to ""immersive"" technology through repeated exposure?)At just under two hours Dawn Treader is the shortest Narnia film to the point of feeling sometimes hasty and overextended--the relationships dont quite flourish at its keeping-to-a-schedule clip with the tears and travails of a CGI dragon upstaging the human element. Apted seems too often to think like an old-hand action director and not enough like the 12-year-old boy who probably read Lewiss book. To enter Narnia to really go giddy with the bright laughing promise of a quest a young viewer with no convenient magic portal of his own needs characters to bring him along. This is I believe the difference between a classic and a successful franchise reboot.
