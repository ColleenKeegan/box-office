The scene in which Laura Linneys agnostic attorney argues that facts have no place in a court of law when questions of religious faith and belief in demons are at stake is worthy of Orwells 1984. Or more topically Bushs America in 2005.The facts based extremely loosely on a documented case that occurred in Germany in the early 70s are simple 19-year-old college student Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter) died during an exorcism performed by Catholic priest Richard Moore (Tom Wilkinson). Expert medical witnesses called by church-going prosecutor Ethan Thomas (Scott Campbell) assert that Emily suffered from a rare blend of epilepsy and psychosis and that in failing to have her hospitalised Father Moore was guilty of negligent homicide. It falls to the priests ambitious sceptical defence lawyer Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) to prove otherwise.A series of would-be Rashomon-style flashbacks - in which Emily speaks in tongues and experiences vivid hallucinations and body-contorting seizures - are distressing but never illuminating. We have no sense of Emily as a human being; only as a victim whose ambiguous symptoms and sad fate are argued over in the most abstract terms be they religious or legal. Director and co-writer Scott Derrickson further undermines the scripts seeming seriousness by randomly drawing on other horror movies (The Exorcist Carrie et al) and employing every generic trick in the book. Silly and insulting yet dangerously seductive.

"Freed Spirits washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Freed Spirits Jennifer Carpenter plays the possessed in an understated drama that tells of a fatal exorcism attempt by a priest in 1976 and his subsequent trial. (By Diyah Pera -- Screen Gems) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday September 9 2005 ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is full of ghostly presences who flit across the screen trailing gossamer filaments of lost possibility dashed hopes and broken dreams. Its a haunted project then full of ache and loss and regret. Im not talking about the movie or the real Anneliese Michel the young German woman upon whose death the movie is based. Im talking about the cast which is far more interesting than the movie. What a collection of superb performers who for one reason or another never quite made it at least to the heights their talent would seem to warrant. The star is the incandescent Laura Linney who just a few years ago seemed poised on a major career after the breakthrough of ""You Can Count on Me."" Now shes in an exorcism movie. The co-star is Campbell Scott. The son of George C. Scott and Colleen Dewhurst hes another who almost got there -- he was the big news in ""Dying Young"" with Julia Roberts way back in 91 then segued into directing (he co-directed the great ""Big Night"" with Stanley Tucci). But I have never heard of his last 16 movies. And now hes in an exorcism movie. Then theres Mary Beth Hurt so poignant and promising in ""Chilly Scenes in Winter"" and a few other films in the late 80s. Since then almost nothing . . . . until the exorcism movie. Finally Henry Czerny a Canadian actor was brilliant in ""The Boys of St. Vincent""; he came to Hollywood and dominated several films chiefly ""Clear and Present Danger"" where his vitality and intellect far outshone nominal star Harrison Fords dullness. He was going to go all the way. He didnt. Hes in an exorcism movie. Worse hes a cameo in an exorcism movie (""And Henry Czerny as . . . the Psychiatrist."") Needless to say with a cast like this ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is a superior performance vehicle and on that count alone is never less than riveting. Each of the performers mentioned as well as the slightly less failed Englishman Tom Wilkinson is superb in the understated drama that tells of a fatal exorcism attempt by a rural priest and his subsequent trial for negligence contributing to the death of a minor. Based on actual events in 1976 in Germany the movie transfers the drama to some flat farm state possibly Ohio and transpires almost entirely within a county courthouse flashing back to key moments and decisions. All in all its a completely professional production vivid and realistic full of neat observations and blessedly disciplined in the nature of its special effects which remain suggestive rather than literal and far from going over the top stay just a little above the bottom. Linney ever intelligent ever human plays Erin Bruner an agnostic ambitious lawyer assigned by her firm -- the big client is ""the diocese"" -- to defend the priest. Bruner has no interest in the supernatural or in religion at all; she simply sees this as one more step on the way to partnership. But gradually she warms to the old man and comes to believe in his belief even if she herself never quite reaches the threshold of belief. Its an amazing job of walking an intellectual line so much harder than playing a true believer. Wilkinson plays the priest and its another quiet disciplined performance. Hes a wonderful actor and he makes us feel Father Moores decency and love of the poor young woman (played in flashback by Jennifer Carpenter) 20 years old but consumed by seizures anorexia and self-mutilation. But we also feel Father Moores truculence He believes that the girl has to be in charge of her own situation and that she must decide what is right. The issue is itself fascinating. Its faith vs. science. The university doctor diagnosed Emily as having grand mal seizures symptomatic of a form of rare psychotic epilepsy but the drug he prescribed had no immediate effect and Emily got sicker and sicker or crazier and crazier. The priest called in by her religious parents saw a girl of an unusually delicate religious nature who so believed in her own possession that he reluctantly attempted the harrowing exorcism. (In reality in Germany the exorcism took several months -- the movie collapses it to a matter of weeks.) At a certain point however Emilys body simply gave out and she died. The state argued that if she had continued under medical care she wouldnt have died and thus the priest was indicted. The director Scott Derrickson seems not to want to suggest to the world that he ever saw ""The Exorcist."" That is a very good decision as is the decision (he co-wrote with longtime collaborator Paul Harris Boardman) to root the story in the everyday and not impose some sort of gothic sensibility on it or gin up any hokey glamour such as making the victims mother a movie star as did William Peter Blatty in his best-selling novel. Instead Emily Roses mother is a doughty farm woman prosaic and shattered; her father is a farmer taciturn but shattered; and the family farm though severe in the harsh Ohio winter doesnt ever take on a phony cinematic ""haunted house"" look. But talk about chilly scenes in winter the snow falling relentlessly on the plains the cold farmhouse standing alone the parents rigid with fear the priest trying to keep the tortured girl from smashing her head through windows or eating spiders; its scary enough without computer-animated goblins thank you very much. I love the way the sleek settings of Midwestern small-city civic architecture play off and amplify the films sense of suspense and mystery. Somehow the generic almost featureless buildings with their glowy faux-marble surfaces seem to make the winter air colder the spiritual despair of the priest deeper the fury of the prosecutor (Scott) more intense the clever sophistry of Linney more glib. Theres no green vomit and nobodys head ever rotates a full 360; we stay in the natural world and never enter a movie world and that makes the movie a lot better. And these actors So great Really its such a shame theyre not at the pinnacle of the profession and that the people who are at the pinnacle of their professions arent making the exorcism movies Wed all be a lot better off. The Exorcism of Emily Rose (120 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for strong imagery and disturbing ideas.

Samuel L. Jackson and Eugene Levy dish up the former in The Man while Laura Linney Campbell Scott and Tom Wilkinson attempt to scare the pants off you off in The Exorcism of Emily Rose. Levy and Jacksons chemistry is the only thing that saves The Man. New Line Productions The Man 1/2 Even with Changing Lanes and A Time to Kill in the mix The Man ranks way down on the list of screen mirth-makers to feature Samuel L. Jackson. This urban cop farce hangs by a sliver on the actors chemistry with Eugene Levy but as comedy teams go give the edge to Snoop Dogg and Lee Iacocca. Woefully formulaic its the kind of rehash that audiences have said theyre sick of in recent polls to determine why so many 2005 moviegoers would rather surf hog futures on the Internet. Jackson plays an ATF agent in Detroit. Levy sells dental supplies. Thanks to a mix-up Levy mistakenly is presumed to be ""The Man"" -- a key link in a gun-running plot. In Roy Orbison terms enduring this movie is like working for The Man. (Rating PG-13 for language rude dialogue and some violence. Running time 1 hour 23 minutes.) --Mike Clark The Exorcism of Emily Rose  1/2 Fashioning a hybrid of a courtroom drama and a horror film that is suspenseful and scary requires a clear vision and directorial finesse. Rose lacks both. But the performances are topnotch. Laura Linney and Campbell Scott play dueling lawyers in the trial of a Catholic priest (Tom Wilkinson) charged with negligence in the death of a teenage girl (Jennifer Carpenter) who he believes is possessed by a demon. (Rating PG-13 for thematic material including intense/frightening sequences.

NO ARCHIVE REUTERS/Diyah ... more Photo HO Realitys a slippery thing when the devils doing the talking 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Exorcism of Emily Rose Drama. Starring Laura Linney Campbell Scott Tom Wilkinson and Jennifer Carpenter. Directed by Scott Derrickson. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Emily Rose is a college freshman who goes away to school and becomes possessed by the devil in her dorm room. This would sound like a common enough phenomenon but in ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" the scenario is meant to be taken literally. Based on a true story ""Emily Rose"" is the thinking persons demon possession movie which presents a chilling case history thats hard to explain away. Two stories are intertwined. Emily (Jennifer Carpenter) is dead from the beginning but her ordeal is rendered in a harrowing series of flashbacks. Meanwhile the priest (Tom Wilkinson) who presided over the unsuccessful exorcism is on trial for negligent homicide. So the film unfolds as a horror movie and a courtroom drama combined with the reasonable staid atmosphere of the court scenes serving to accentuate the horror. In most horror movies the whole world has gone mad but the courtroom aspect here provides a frame for the horror that makes it all seem quite possible or probable -- and even scarier for its being a part of recognizable daily life. Emily is a normal teenage girl who is visited one night by an invisible entity that starts moving things around her room and attempting to get inside her. She pushes the demon off but the demon -- or demons -- come back and the next time they set up camp inside her making life hell. In one particularly stark and memorable scene she is sitting in a cafe and can hear nothing but the sound of forks and knives clinking against plates. The sense of brutal isolation is conveyed. Emily runs out onto the street and as she passes ostensibly normal people their faces transform into demon faces. A minor metaphysical question When Emily sees a demon in these people is she hallucinating or is she actually seeing what is really in people even if they themselves are unaware? Its a chilling thought just as chilling as the moment when Emily rushes into a church for sanctuary looking as calm and unruffled as Munchs ""The Scream"" and finds that the people sitting in the pews have demon faces too. Laura Linney plays the priests lawyer Erin a woman who has never given much thought to the spirit world. Her career is her religion. An agnostic she has the task of trying to make the jury agnostic on the subject of science A series of prosecution experts testify that Emily was suffering from an exotic form of psychosis with an epileptic component and Erins job is to make the jury doubt it. Curiously and intentionally ""Emily Rose"" has the scientists explanation sounding more convoluted and far-fetched -- more voodoo in its way -- than the priests. The continued presence of the spirit world unites the past and present halves of the movie with invisible demons doing things to menace and unnerve Erin and the priest daily at 3 in the morning (""the witching hour""). Meanwhile the viewer is never allowed to forget the visceral torment of possession. In ""The Exorcist"" Linda Blair was scary. In ""Emily Rose"" whats happening to Emily is scary. She tears her hair out eats insects experiences grotesque convulsions and scrapes her nails against the wall but even as the demons are making her do these things she remains in some way conscious and present. Talk about hell. The film gives Linney a chance to play someone sharp and aggressive again after a few years of playing softies lightweights witnesses and victims. She expands in the role. Wilkinson lends intensity and conviction to the priest. As for newcomer Carpenter one could easily overlook her merely as that poor possessed girl. But thats a performance and a strong one. The mood created by these human stars is augmented enormously by the films other star -- the soundtrack -- which starts humming vibrating and bringing on an ominous chorus every time its 3 in the morning. The sound is loud but the effect is so subtle that some people might not even notice it. Its the sound of being too scared to think straight. -- Advisory This film contains frightening scenes of possession gruesome images and torment.

Once we saw Regan rearranging the furniture and projectile-vomiting ballistic loads of green goo for ""The Exorcist"" the genre has grown as stale as Lucifers laundry. Stigmata swearing at priests brave little girls contorted worse than a Cirque du Soleil acrobat - you can cast the devil out of the body apparently but you cant make him read a new script. A marketing executive would call ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" a repurposing. Combine two genres to save an old one. One viewer leaving the movie called it ""Law and Order"" meets ""The Exorcist"" and thats exactly right. Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson) is on trial for negligent homicide after the death of college student Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter). Sanctioned by the Catholic Church Moore had tried to treat her catastrophic hallucinations and mutilations by ritual exorcism. Emily died of malnutrition and other maladies medical explanations inconclusive. Most of the story unfolds during Moores trial. Laura Linney is the big-time lawyer hired by the church to defend him and the attorney throws herself into it with agnostic gusto. ""Emily Rose"" succeeds not so much with re-branding but through good old-fashioned star power. Linney as always manages to be simultaneously radiant witty vulnerable and intensely likable. When she lets doubt creep in humanity gushes out. Wilkinson carries the other half. Were a bit skeptical of his confident claims He has seen adequate proof of the devil and doesnt believe that convincing the rest of us will make him feel better. Wilkinson is somehow quiet and fervent at the same time a neat trick. The middle bits are not quite so effective. Emilys hauntings take place on a Midwestern college campus and at her bleak farm home; they are the standard stuff of Catholic lore lurching between profanity cockroach infestations and taunts in Aramaic. For us skeptics the devil still has a few questions to answer such as If he can inhabit a body why immediately ruin that body? Why not possess Gwyneth Paltrow so he can at least get some media face time? The real daring of ""Emily Rose"" is not necessarily the courtroom backdrop. Its the change of mood from ""The Exorcists"" relentless cynicism to a sincere evangelism. Hollywood special effects can make most of us believe in the devil at least for 90 minutes; it takes more care and subtlety to make us believe in salvation. ""Emily Rose"" allegedly based on a true story dares to try asking us to open our hearts and minds in the same way Linneys eyes grow wider and wider. Director and writer Scott Derrickson gets extra credit for not trying to lead us all the way to the front pew. Linney is left with many questions though not a lot of answers and the movies closing is a redemption for storytelling. Are we alone or not alone she wonders and then like a good lawyer answers her own query ""Either thought is astonishing.""

"Preposterous Exorcism elicits groans - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Preposterous Exorcism elicits groans By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  September 9 2005 Certain very good actors have an excellent eye for trash. Laura Linney might have 20/20 vision based on her parts in Congo"" The Mothman Prophecies"" and most outrageously The Life of David Gale"" in which she played a homely yet extreme political activist. The fun of these movies is that Linney often seems too refined for such greasy junk but there she is anyway hamming it down as it were.Linney is more or less the star of The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" a perfectly sorry excuse for a horror film that casts her as Erin Bruner an uptight top-flight lawyer whos defending a priest (Tom Wilkinson) accused of killing a young woman (Jennifer Carpenter) in a bid to rid her of unholiness.Most of the movie is set in a courtroom so Linney has very little to do with the tasteless flashbacks to Emilys affliction. But the movie is a tale of double possession. Erin is crazed about her career. Yes this is one of those movies about a woman whose only ambition is making partner. She goes to bed alone in a sterile home has no friends and eats sleeps and breathes her case which plays like an extra devilish episode of Law amp; Order.""The archdiocese specifically requested Erin to defend Wilkinsons Father Moore. She recently got an accused murderer acquitted and her star is on the rise. But the Catholics dont know -- shes agnostic. In a sense this is ideal for her line of defense I cant prove Emily was possessed but hey I cant prove she wasnt.Of course the movie which claims to be based on a true story seems to believe she was. We see poor Emily a recent college freshman from a rural town pinned back in her bed an invisible force atop her body strangling her. She flips out in class much the way the teen paranoids did in those Nightmare on Elm Street"" films and runs across campus shrieking in the rain in a nightgown. She sees ghoulish faces on her classmates and hears heavy breathing. She eats bugs speaks in tongues and contorts her body into a satanic yoga pose best described as downward demon. Look for the Emily Rose training regimen at your local Healthworks.The district attorney -- a starchy Campbell Scott in what appears to be a stunt mustache -- claims Emily was suffering from a psychotic bout with epilepsy. She died of malnutrition and nasty physical trauma he says. As a rebuttal Erin later calls to the stand an expert in the science of possession"" who is played by the regal Oscar nominee Shohreh Aghdashloo. The actress answers a few questions and then is free to cash her check.Scott Derrickson directed and with Paul Harris Boardman wrote The Exorcism of Emily Rose."" He and Boardman also wrote the cheeky 2000 sequel to the teen slasher flick Urban Legends."" The horror impulse that grips the filmmaking -- full moons gotcha"" editing pigeons that act like bats things going bump in the night -- is mostly just cheap tricks.There are dark forces surrounding this trial"" Father Moore tells Erin. Demons exist whether you believe in them or not."" But the movie never makes good on his promise.The material cries out for the craftsmanship of The Exorcist"" which this movie is desperate to evoke. Linney has never looked foxier and she uses good diction and her Ivy League carriage as weapons against some of the more laughable scenes. (See her face after a car hits her star witness)The preposterousness of the trial which is never lost on Scotts lawyer has its pleasures too. At one point Scott objects to a line of questioning. On what grounds?"" asks the judge. Silliness."" Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

"Exorcism of Emily Rose The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; exorcism-of-emily-rose-the ) Exorcism of Emily Rose The (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli The Exorcism of Emily Rose is being sold as the latest PG-13 horror movie albeit one that deals with demonic possession instead of ghosts. In reality however its a courtroom drama with a twinge of the supernatural (most of which occurs during flash-backs). Those expecting to be scared by this movie will be disappointed. Aside from the occasional ""boo"" moment the film lacks anything to stand nape hairs on end and the trail - which occupies a majority of the overlong 113 minute running length - is unremarkable despite some nice performances. Sony should be ashamed for pandering to The Ring crowd with this motion picture. Although some elements are lifted from The Exorcist the term ""horror movie"" doesnt really apply. The Exorcism of Emily Rose is a courtroom procedural which investigates whether Emilys condition was spiritual (possession) or medical (epilepsy and schizophrenia). We get all of the standard stuff thats expected from trial-related dramas including surprising revelations emotional testimony and a stirring closing argument from the attorney for the defense. What we dont get is anything that horror fans will find involving. The film has been labeled with another of those ""based on a true story"" tags which means there are some facts sprinkled into Paul Harris Boardman and director Scott Derricksons screenplay. Its best to view The Exorcism of Emily Rose as a fiction; that way theres no need to worry about whats real and what is invented. The true-life trial was one of medicine versus religion but a lot of embellishment has occurred to make the screenplay appealing to a mainstream audience. And by adapting the ""spiritual"" point-of-view (in other words accepting that demons exist) Derrickson allows his film to incorporate some supernatural elements. Otherwise it would likely have been too dry for any studio to greenlight. Whatever flaws The Exorcism of Emily Rose may have acting isnt among them. Laura Linney is credible as Erin Bruner a hotshot defense lawyer who is brought in to defend a priest charged with ""negligent homicide"" in the death of Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter) a 19-year old girl who died following a failed exorcism. Tom Wilkinson sporting a letter-perfect American accent brings depth and humanity to the part of Father Moore. The priest doesnt care whether he goes to jail for taking what he believes to be the correct path. The Church wants Moore to accept the plea bargain being offered by the prosecution but his goal is to take the stand so that he can tell the story of Emily Rose. Campbell Scott is thoroughly dislikeable as the prosecutor - but thats pretty much how prosecutors are supposed to be in movies where the filmmakers accept the defenses perspective. Most of the demon possession scenes occur in flashback and Jennifer Carptenter is required to do her best imitation of Linda Blair (without pea soup projectile vomit or 360-degree head twisting). She makes strange sounds scratches the walls displays amazing double-jointedness and gains unusual eye coloring. The only non-flashback creepiness occurs when Erin wakes up a few times at 300 in the morning and thinks that someone may be in her apartment. (300 we are later told is the ""witching hour"" - the time when the forces of evil are the strongest.) The Exorcism of Emily Rose is entertaining to the same degree as any courtroom drama of limited imagination can be. The supernatural elements add some flavor to the mix but should not be the reason to see the film. For what it is the film does its job but its probably better to wait for the DVD release. This is small-screen material getting a big-screen treatment. Take away the performances and all that would be left is a cheapish B-grade motion picture.

"The Exorcism of Emily Rose. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Exorcism of Emily Rose. The Exorcism of Emily Rose. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 8 2005 253 PM Demons Out The devil on trial in The Exorcism of Emily Rose. By David Edelstein A devil of a movie The religious horror picture The Exorcism of Emily Rose (Screen Gems) is the latest and tackiest assault on the reality-based secular community--just the kind of propaganda thats not supposed to be coming from ultraliberalcommiejewfag Hollywood. It goes even further than the religious horror picture Signs which suggests that if you dont believe in God you cant possibly protect your kids from demonic aliens. This one says that if you believe in medical science over prayer you not only cant protect your kids you suppress the spiritual antibodies they need to fight the devil. Take a pill and youre all Satans. The movie is basically a blood-soaked Christian martyr tale (complete with stigmata) that masquerades as a Rashomon-like courtroom drama. Its loosely based on a real tragedy the death of a young German woman in the early 70s in the course of an exorcism. The locale is now rural farmhouse America--a big old isolated house beside a gnarly tree that looks like its going to stand in at some point for Gethsemane. (It does.) Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter) left that home and family for college thereby exposing her supersensitive self to the forces of evil. Advertisement The movie begins with the arrival of a coroner (for no particular reason hes lit like Father Merrin in The Exorcist) and the arrest of Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson) for allowing Emily Rose to both waste away and tear herself apart. Even without the hissing obscenities pouring out of her shes a bigger fright in death than in life. Father Moore could plead guilty to criminal negligence and be sentenced to a year in prison (six months with good behavior--and he doesnt look like the sort of man who would smush inmates faces in their food) but he chooses to go to trial to ""tell Emilys story."" His high-priced defender Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) is hired by the archdiocese to make sure that his story isnt shared with a secular public which might think that the church is composed of wackos. Although Americans believe in God by a whopping margin and in angels and demons by a sizable majority Scott Derrickson the director and co-writer (with Paul Harris Boardman) depicts a country in which belief is in peril under attack by science and the law and pesky facts. A man of God hasnt a prayer. While the district attorney has shrewdly appointed a churchgoing prosecutor (Campbell Scott) who nonetheless believes in the rigid separation of church and state Erin is an agnostic a heavy drinker and a careerist who has just won a not-guilty verdict for an apparent murderer. Success in this trial will mean a partnership in her firm--and her conversion to Father Moores cause will mean a partnership in a Higher Firm. Its a pity that all this exposition is written with such clunkiness that it would make George Lucas yelp and that Erins change of spirit is never dramatized. But the dialogue is rattled off at a screwball-newspaper-comedy clip the better to propel us into the courtroom and the hellish flashbacks. Derrickson claims in interviews that Rashomon is one of his favorite movies and that The Exorcism of Emily Rose gives both sides of the court battle their due. If you believe that I have a grilled cheese sandwich with the image of the Virgin Mary that you might want to buy. We do get flashes--almost subliminal ones--of the prosecutors version of events but hes a close-minded prig whose mere facts are far outweighed by extended sequences that leave no doubt whatsoever of Emily Roses demonic possession. Advertisement And not only Emilys. Father Moore warns Erin that ""dark forces surround this trial"" and she is promptly beset by demons that rattle her windows and stop her watch at 3 a.m. (the devils hour as opposed to 3 p.m. when Jesus was said to have been crucified). Erin does however find a gold chain on the ground with her full initials which suggests that Someone Up There likes her. Laughable as it often is The Exorcism of Emily Rose features striking makeup and effects (faces of passersby run like Munchian screamers) along with scary compositions. Theyre derivative though--not just of The Exorcist but of Carrie (Emily Rose stands drenched in a church with her arms rigid and slightly askew) and The Blair Witch Project (the jittery hand-held camerawork when she bounds out of the farmhouse in mid-exorcism). Even more over-the-top is the soundtrack with its gnashing and moans and winds and squeaky hinges. Boy they must have had a ball in the mixing room. For all its cheap ghost-movie effects the film aspires to something larger the idea--one of the chief talking points for proponents of Intelligent Design as their ""scholarship"" is shot down--that even if we cant scientifically prove the existence of the Almighty (and the demons who try to undo his work) we must open ourselves to that possibility and recognize it as valid. Certainly it is as valid as that other godless way of looking at the world. And its more imperative We dismiss the battle for our souls at our peril. The Exorcism of Emily Rose has an outlandish trump card the ineffectiveness of an anti-convulsive drug called Gambitrol prescribed by clueless physicians for epileptic seizures. An anthropologist (Shohreh Aghdashloo)--a sort of scientist but an open-minded one obviously familiar with the kind of spooky occurrences that gave Father Merrin the willies--theorizes that the exorcism didnt work because Gambitrol dulled Emily Rose leaving her without the wits and mental resources to wage the fight against the devil from within. Advertisement But--and this is a SPOILER folks--this doesnt turn out to be so bad. For in her death Emily Rose can prove that demons are real and therefore so is God. The movies overriding themes arent novel. Many biblical scholars (even those without Doubt) have argued that one reason Christianity took hold in the Western World was the churchs insistence that demons--and their overlord Satan--exist. They needed demons to make God a necessity not a luxury. Meanwhile The Exorcism of Emily Rose takes us back about four centuries to when mental illness was often interpreted as demonic possession. All this highfalutin stuff has almost made me forget to say that the acting in this movie is unusually bad--atrocious even. The exceptions are Carpenter who wails and contorts herself impressively and Linney whose line readings suggest an intelligence that belies her acceptance of her role. Wilkinson retreats into himself and is mysteriously wooden as if he realized in midstream what hed gotten into and is trying to will himself to a higher plane. Aghdashloo speaks with all the authority of Zsa-Zsa Gabor. Apart from Henry Czerny as a physician there isnt a grace note to be had. In fairness I should disclose one thing I was born at 3 a.m. Could it be that the devil put me on this earth to raise objections to movies like The Passion of the Christ and The Exorcism of Emily Rose? As I mulled this over in the screening room about an hour into the film a priest sat down in the seat next to me and I felt a sudden demonic urge to strike him. In my defense this was because his cell phone was going off. But still It might have been Satan on the other end of the line reaching out to me. I resisted though. Im not on any medication.

Posted September 7 2005 -- 1200 AM EDT I have little problem believing that there are people in this world who become possessed by evil spirits. I have a larger problem believing that the only movie those evil spirits have ever seen at the hellplex is The Exorcist. If the devil and his minions are so devilishly clever why dont they express themselves in more nefariously unexceptional ways blending in with the neighborhood to wreak havoc? The devil is strictly Linda Blair-era old school in The Exorcism of Emily Rose an intelligent inquiry into the limitations of belief and faith as a defense in a court of law woo-wooed up with a heaping of religious-girl-gone-mad conniption fits. Part Law amp; Order part The Omen the movie doesnt trust the audience to follow serious theological and legal discussion without a spook hook. The story is as they say in the Church of Movie Coming Attractions inspired by real events (the case on which its based took place in 1978). Emily (Jennifer Carpenter a champion shrieker) the tormented young woman of the title leaves her family in Rural Devout USA goes off to Godless University and becomes infested one dark dorm night of the soul by demons. She cant sleep. She looks into the eyes of her classmates and sees blood and ghouls. Eventually her torment drives her to drop out and return home where she is first diagnosed as epileptic and then as psychotic. By the time Father Richard Moore (Tom Wilkinson reliable player of responsible men) sees her she is a ravaged soul in need of a full exorcism. The approach fails. The girl dies. And Father Moore is charged with negligent homicide represented at his trial by Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) an atheist tough cookie in a power pantsuit. The prosecution argues that Emily died because her priest ignored her medical condition. The defense contends -- well Erin doesnt know what to contend. To explain her shift from secular doubt to a newborn faith in her clients veracity director Scott Derrickson and writing collaborator Paul Harris Boardman put the attorney through her own mild attack of spiritual demons. Linney doesnt have to shriek and vomit but her character does see strange doings (Lucifer loves breaking things in kitchens). Unfortunately by the time she comes to believe in the power of belief my eyes had rolled back in my head. Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

Anchored by a compelling performance from Laura Linney as an lawyer who takes on the defense of a priest accused of negligent homicide during an exorcism pic may prove too talky to scare up devilish returns in todays mass market. Some genuine shocks punctuate ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" an unusually intelligent genre item that manages to mix full-bore horror with courtroom drama. Anchored by a compelling performance from Laura Linney as an agnostic lawyer who takes on the defense of a Catholic priest accused of negligent homicide during an exorcism pic may prove too talky and CGI-light to scare up devilish returns in todays mass market. But given the right chance it could score with upscale genre fans of both sexes especially overseas. All clipped sentences and soignee power-dressing Linney plays Erin Bruner junior partner at a law firm run by Karl Gunderson (Colm Feore). Ambitious Erin is a rising star after getting a high-profile murderer off the hook; when Karl asks her take on the case of Father Richard Moore (Brit actor Tom Wilkinson) she accepts with the proviso that shell make senior partner if she wins. Meanwhile to protect itself from possible accusations of antireligious bias the district attorneys office has decided to field assistant D.A. Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott) a buttoned-up devout churchgoer. Based on a true story nicely lean screenplay by Paul Harris Boardman and helmer Scott Derrickson packs everything the audience needs to know into the opening reel or so including the first of many flashbacks to the titular victim Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter). Erin refuses any plea bargaining as the padre wishes to tell the full story of Emily and her exorcism in court. At the 15-minute mark the trial begins and in the films most original structural gambit for the following 100 minutes pic intercuts courtroom proceedings with flashbacks to Emilys story as its revealed by witness testimony. Pic thus works on two concurrent levels The debate between science and faith (and its effect especially on nonbeliever Erin) is played out in the trial sequences and brief noncourtroom interludes while the flashbacks supply the horror in increasingly ramped-up style. Story emerges of an average 19-year-old from the sticks who wins a college scholarship and soon finds herself ""possessed"" by some dark force that bends her out of shape at 3 in the morning (the traditional witching hour of evil). The scientists put Emilys condition down to ""psychotic-epileptic disorder"" and prescribe a calming drug. After fleeing one night to a church Emily comes under the sway of Father Richard who believes -- and convinces Emily -- that the problem is spiritual not physical. With her familys consent Father Richard finally performs an official Catholic exorcism that pushes her weakened body too far. As the trial continues Erin herself starts falling prey to nighttime scares. As her agnosticism starts to crumble she constructs a defense argument that hinges on spiritual possession being accepted as a valid phenomenon in Western society. Derrickson (""Hellraiser V Inferno"" ""Ghosting"") handles the courtroom scenes in a straightforward manner that would make Perry Mason feel at home with the usual minor dramas over for example finding an expert witness in time. Its all generic stuff though the dialogue is well handled by the cast and the arguments are laid out in an accessible way. (Sometimes too accessibly with Erin repeatedly saying ""By that you mean..."") Its the juxtaposition of that part of the screenplay with the horror material that gives pic its special tension and flavor. Most notably Derrickson amp; Co. dont resort to the expected CGI bonanza Virtually all the horror comes from plain old-fashioned special effects lighting color design and performances especially by Carpenter whos utterly believable in her moments of ugly possession. Deafening score by Christopher Young would become tiresome if used all the way through the picture but complements the all-out horror flashbacks. Screenplays avoidance of unnecessary character backgrounding touchy-feely downtime with family and friends and explanations for every event gives pic a tight trim feel even at two hours. In those respects the film has more in common with Asian horror movies than with regular U.S. genre fare. Exorcism scene when it finally arrives is genuinely powerful. Apart from one wobbly scene in which Erin confesses to Father Richard that her lack of faith is starting to weaken Linney carries the picture making the most of an essentially routine role especially in her fine concluding speech. Scott makes Ethan a tough humorless opponent and Wilkinson  despite a fluctuating Yank accent plays the priest to the hilt with him and Linney pairing well. Smaller roles are professionally filled with even an actress of Mary Beth Hurts caliber cast in the hardly demanding role of the court judge. Tech package especially Tom Sterns widescreen lensing is smooth in all departments. Film was shot in Vancouver.
