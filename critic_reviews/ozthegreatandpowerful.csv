Plus the rest of the week in movies. by Wesley Morris on March 13 2013 I dont know whats going on with the movies right now. You can smell the meetings taste the money and all but see the cutting of one hit being wishfully pasted into the production of an aspiring one. This isnt the season to complain about how bad the releases are since the first quarter of the year is typically when Hollywood takes out its garbage. But the nature of the garbage has been puzzling. It isnt simply that the American action film has effectively been AARP-ed and R.I.P.-ed. Its that its been freakishly crossbred with fairy tales storybooks and childrens movies. Hansel and Gretel have great leather clothes and crossbows for witch hunting. Little Red Riding Hood winds up in what is basically the imitation-crabmeat version of Twilight which was pretty imitation-crabmeaty to begin with. Two different movies place their emphasis on what a warrior Snow White can be. And last week gave us Jack the Giant Slayer with motion-capture caveman giants. This is all since Tim Burtons version of Alice in Wonderland made more than a billion dollars a couple of years ago in a cruddy-looking 3-D incarnation. Whats come after it are loud crowded sludgy visually incoherent movies with good actors the occasional great star and a numbing formula. The climaxes necessitate an epic battle or the circling of pawns and knights around a crucial human chess piece. In one sense none of it is criminal -- not the overhaul of the tales or the astounding digital and manual craftsmanship involved in realizing the revision. I just never leave these movies with a sense of why they needed to be made. No one seems to have even decided -- in turning a fairy tale into a film that Hollywood thinks a boy would want to see -- whether the result ought to be more Peter Jackson or Marvel Comics. Often it feels like an overtested science project of both -- and a willful distrust of the human darkness social allegory and robust femaleness of some of these stories as if it were Walt Disney who invented the Big Bad Wolf. You watch them all and long for the funhouse purity of Enchanted which had the starriness of Amy Adams the starrishness of James Marsden and a ripe target the fairy-tale industrial complex. But its not satire these movies need. Its simply a point. For an early 40 minutes and in one scene toward the end Oz the Great and Powerful makes some sense. It actually begins as the 1939 classic does in black-and-white in a square projection ratio so that when the movie makes it to Oz the frame expands and fills the entire screen in color like a hundred inkwells spilling at the same time. The film explains how a carnival magician named Oscar Diggs (James Franco) winds up as the Wizard of Oz. So yes its what wed call a prequel one that didnt originate with L. Frank Baum either. More than a century ago Baum wrote at least a dozen and a half Oz books. Inventing a new one is like showing up at a dinner party with a meal you cooked. And the credited screenwriters Mitchell Kapner and the playwright David Lindsay-Abaire remain sporadically true to the spirit of Baum and the prettified Hollywood classic that The Wonderful Wizard of Oz became. Those opening scenes in black-and-white are the best in the movie. Theyre set in the same Depression-era dust bowl of the The Wizard of Oz but director Sam Raimi infuses them with glum humor that establishes Oscar as a cad con man and mild megalomaniac. Movies about magic are ultimately about the magic of movies but Raimi and the writers set aside that self-awareness to play up the generic necessity of belief. During Oscars show people in the audience shout out that they can see the wires holding up his levitating assistant (Abigail Leigh Spencer) and theres suspense about whether he has a trick up his sleeve to get him out of that jam. He does. When he dazzles the spectators with his denial he dazzles us. Raimi could have stopped there. Or rather he could have stayed. Carnivals circuses and freaks speak to him Hes made the two Evil Dead movies three Spider-Mans and an underappreciated film noir with Billy Bob Thornton. Everything about these black-and-white passages comes easily to him the comedy the wonder of the filmmaking the poignant earnestness of the carnival audience. Oscars show is so persuasive that a little girl in a wheelchair begs him to make her walk. He says he cant and the crowd turns on him. This is good corny stuff that gets at the magic that the original film extracted from Baum. Visually and thematically this part of the new Oz is distinct from all those other movies based on childrens book and fairy tales. But the twister that comes to whirl Oscar into Oz is so preordained you could find its departure information and flight time from an airport travel board. Oscars hot-air balloon sails by flowers that unfurl into satellites. When the balloon crashes he meets Theodora (Mila Kunis) a raspy witch in some of Joan Collinss old hats and clothes. Theodora likes him. So does her sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz) and very discreetly Glinda the good (blonde) witch played by Michelle Williams rerouting her Marilyn Monroe performance into the realm of the childrens birthday party. The bellicosity and backstabbing that ensues is a lot like what happens in both the Lord of the Rings series and any film made about the salad days of the British monarchy. Only here there are flying baboons a talking monkey whos dressed like a bellhop and a showdown that requires the participation of lots of little people. The business with the witches warring over territory Evanoras murder of Glindas dad and Oscar should have a mightier kick than it does. But its as if everyones fear of going too far in the wrong direction -- of playing up Evanoras villainy Theodoras sense of betrayal and Glindas virtuousness -- would push the movie into misogynistic territory. I can respect that. Of course no one seemed to think twice about putting a tall dutiful black handyman (Bill Cobbs) and a jive black dwarf (Tony Cox) alongside a computer-generated monkey dressed like a bellhop. But the Oz team should have risked offending us because what weve got when the witchcraft really gets going in Oz is Wicked stuck in the breakdown lane. You can feel all three women especially Weisz trying to apply some humanity. But Weisz often seems frozen with uncertainty. These effects-encrusted super-productions seem to embarrass her into retreat. And Kunis who undergoes a climactic physical transformation doesnt have the ferocity to meet the makeup more than halfway. This sort of stock part needs a Glenn Close someone who actually wants to burn down a movie to turn puppies into coats and doesnt care what the grad students or animal-rights activists will say. Its silly for Oz to avoid that kind of showmanship. If Raimi wants to stress how evil loses to goodness he cant douse us with the goodness and starve us of the evil. Maybe its that none of the women brings anything out of Franco so Franco brings nothing new out of them. This isnt to say hes bad. His charm is his crookedness. When its working its the closest weve come to the second coming of Richard Dreyfuss. But Dreyfuss also liked to ham it up. Francos become a vegetarian. Still casting him as a con man is the closest the movie comes to allegory of any kind. Some of the funniest bits feature him grinning at whoevers supposed to be standing opposite him whether its one of the women the little people or that monkey (whose voice and comic timing belong to Zach Braff). How stoned he sometimes seems feels right for a movie whose most divine sequence involves Francos face superimposed onto billowing smoke just as Frank Morgans was in the original Oz. Only Raimi heightens the images spectral doominess. If I were 8 Id ask to have the month off from sleeping alone. The visual teams have conjured a lot of wondrous images. I can only begin to imagine for example how many months were required to perfect the liquid rainbow smearing on Glindas soap-bubble force fields. Its work that Pixar would have to applaud. Still its not enough. At this point Im epic-battle-weary witched out tired of formerly wicked idiosyncratic directors like Burton and Raimi manufacturing a bright side to their old darkness. Before I saw Oz I went to see Jack the Giant Slayer and was thankful for even the fleeting vision Raimi gives his film. Despite Jack having been directed by Bryan Singer whos become a kind of comic-book movie auteur (two strong X-Men movies one ambitious but leaden Superman) its virtually indistinguishable from whats preceded it. Its just the old fairy tale turned into a 3-D-optional theme park. Singer keeps it zooming but thats all hes doing piloting a ride. This is another occasion to admire the hard work and ingenuity of the cinematographer the production designers costumers and the effects artists even as actors like Stanley Tucci Ian McShane Ewen Bremner and a well-dressed better-coiffed Ewan McGregor become either mannequins or passengers. The beanstalk itself is something to see and you can tell its Singers favorite thing here. Its presented with love and foreboding. It has leaves the size of a queen bed that a more inspired movie would have tried to smoke. The giants here enjoy the kind of conflict and complexity that you once could expect from actual humans in this sort of film (Bill Nighy was the motion-capture model and does the lead giants voice). Not even that lasts because Singer is eager to get to the part where the giants squabble their way from their high-up kingdom and down Jacks beanstalk so they can sack McShanes kingdom. A church bell is weaponized. Arrows are shot like bullets from an Uzi. Horses leap onto closing drawbridges. Forget that Giant Slayer feels photocopied and is entirely unnecessary. Its just not exciting. Jack (Nicholas Hoult) has a sidekick and a partner for smooching in Princess Isabelle (Eleanor Tomlinson) whos presented as a thrill-seeking rebel but spends the movie requiring a great deal of assistance. Shes here because the other fairy-tale action movies have a tough girl but no one knows what to do with her so she just becomes a princess with Brave flavoring. Giant Slayer was no. 1 at the box office last weekend but the grosses were reported as a disappointment. Thats because at the same time that its unclear who this films for its also too monotonous and calculated to be for anybody. Who knows who the audience for Stoker is. The movie is the English-language debut of the greatish South Korean director Park Chan-wook stars Alice from Tim Burtons Wonderland and Mia Wasikowska and feels like a fairy tale puffed out from Jacks beanstalk buds. She plays India an unsexed teenager wilting after the recent mysterious death of her father but aroused by an uncle (Matthew Goode) who does a lot of leering and dancing with her mother (Nicole Kidman). The script by the Prison Break actor Wentworth Miller wants to evoke Hitchcocks Shadow of a Doubt in which a girl suspects an uncle of evil things. This is that movie via the food processor. Once or twice Kidman threatens to start a fire but the movies been assembled in a way that denies her any emotional continuity. Its too safe too knotty too wastefully handsome too dull. All the drama is buried beneath comatose acting -- Dermot Mulroney Jacki Weaver and Phyllis Somerville are also here but dont get too attached to them. And the shot-making here is far more astounding when Park means it. His Korean opuses -- Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance Oldboy Lady Vengeance the vampire thriller Thirst -- operate with theatrical lunacy stupefying precision electric acting and queasy violence. Theyre exhilarating and occasionally nauseating experiences in which he dares himself to shift to yet a higher gear of retribution and morality (his detractors would say immorality). Hes Quentin Tarantinos only rival in the category of grandiose gutter art. Stoker is what happens when gutter art breaks down and finally gets a room at the shelter.

Like the stage musical Wicked it assumes that its audience knows the story told in The Wizard of Oz. Yet even for people who (for some reason) havent seen the other movie I suspect this will play as a stand-alone piece; it just wont have the same resonance. The production pays homage to the 1939 movie by opening in black amp; white in the old-fashioned Academy screen ratio then expanding and turning into vivid color once the magician named Oz (short for Oscar) arrives in the faraway land that bears his name. I was a bit skeptical about the casting of James Franco in this role as a small-time carnival magician but he is thoroughly engaging as a struggling con man and charmer. The screenplay by Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire (based on Kapners screen story and of course the works of L.Frank Baum) offers a sturdy and relatable through-line. Our roguish hero flees Kansas in a hot-air balloon during a tornado and winds up in Oz. The citizens who are under the control of a wicked witch welcome him as he appears to be the wizard whose arrival has been prophesized. He tries to explain that he isnt a wizard at all but after being smitten by a beautiful witch named Theodora (Mila Kunis) and dazzled by the golden treasure he will acquire he decides to play along. The relationship between Kunis her sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz) and the good witch Glinda (Michelle Williams) propels much of the story that follows. (Youll get no spoilers from me.) At its core is the question of whether or not Oz can summon the bravado to become the leader the people of Oz need and deserve. Zach Braff and Joey King appear briefly at the beginning of the movie then morph into Francos colorful companions a flying monkey and a porcelain china doll. To pull this off Oz The Great and Powerful is played straight; its sincerity should win over younger viewers completely. It isnt overplayed (thank goodness) so grownups can engage with it too. And in the tradition of the 1939 classic director Sam Raimi and his team fill the screen with sights of awe and wonder beginning with a dazzling title sequence designed by Garson yU of yU+co. Its difficult to rouse an audience with something new and different these days but Raimi and company have pulled it off and much of the credit goes to production designer Robert Stromberg who won Oscars for his work on Avatar and the 2010 Alice in Wonderland. Is this an Oz for the ages? Thats not for me to predict but I do think it gives audiences of 2013 a satisfying big-screen experience. It doesnt eclipse The Wizard of Oz but it fills the bill as a modern-day companion piece.

First it enchants then it is pleasantly leisurely paced with a humorous to a point flying monkey the love story is tasteful but the rest is either dark or ineffective. I would give this a miss. Reply JD May 14 2016 125 am Very good film Reply Bryan May 14 2016 125 am I enoyed this review. While I generally agree that it is recommendable to friends and family it is by no means perfect. I thought Francos performance was a bit uneven struggling to find a balance for his characters transformation from aloof con-man to sincere change-of-heart. Kunis was fine but making the leap from smitten and soft-spoken to shrieking Wicked Witch seemed to happen too fast. Overall though I agree this is probably the best incarnation of Oz that we could have gotten in the age of CGI (though I appreciate that the makers built real sets this time). Reply Jane May 14 2016 125 am Enjoyed your review Just FYI the Wizards full name is Oscar Zoroaster Phadrig Isaac Norman Henkel Emmannuel Ambroise Diggs and Oz comes from his first two initials though Oscar makes sense. Yes the entire name would be OZ PINHEAD. Reply David May 14 2016 125 am Ive just come back from seeing it - I thought this film was fantastic. Each of the actors were great in their roles and I thought Franco pulled off the title role really well - theres a lot of depth in Franco as an actor and Weisz Kunis and Williams each do a wonderful job. The reflections on the china doll character in close-ups indicate the sheer level of the special effects that have been employed for this film. There was some very well-time humor in the film also to contrast with some of the darker moments. I agree with Maltin - as a modern companion piece to the original this film fits perfectly. Reply ANM May 14 2016 125 am Is Maltin for real? What exactly is ""new and different"" about this derivative Shrek-y waste of time? This movie was depressing expensive garbage. Reply brad May 14 2016 125 am Did you see the movie? There are a lot of old and unattractive people in Oz Reply Norm May 14 2016 125 am More is Less maybe they should make Baums books in Europe  to stay away from the Politically Correct American thinking...Pass... Reply Kay May 14 2016 125 am Im so glad you refrained from spoilers My only beef is that apparently unlike the 1939 version everyone in Oz is HOT now. Even the Munchkins No old people nobody that isnt attractive (unless you count the monkeys). Oh well.... Thanks Leonard for the review.

"Oz the Great and Powerful | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; oz-the-great-and-powerful ) Oz the Great and Powerful (United States 2013) March 08 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Oz the Great and Powerful is director Sam Raimis prequel to The Wizard of Oz. This new vision of The Land of Oz is an imaginative mix of live-action and CGI that pays homage to the iconic images and timeless sense of wonder in the classic The Wizard of Oz without being too deferential. Its familiar enough to be comfortable but not so familiar that it feels worn and repetitive. Although L. Frank Baums original book is in the public domain MGM owns the rights to many of the specific visual interpretations of elements from the novel thereby limiting how closely Oz the Great and Powerful could be linked to The Wizard of Oz. For example dont expect to hear any of the beloved musical cues. Also missing is the Wicked Witch of the Wests mole. Its not unreasonable to expect Oz the Great and Powerful to be the first film in a family franchise. Although remaking The Wizard of Oz would introduce a series of legal hurdles it could be managed and Baum wrote thirteen other tales of Oz so theres no shortage of material. With that in mind Oz the Great and Powerful functions as something of an ""origin story"" for certain characters detailing how both of the Wicked Witches (East and West) got their starts and how the Wizard attained his exalted position. Although theres no Dorothy or Toto the Cowardly Lion and Scarecrow make cameos. (I didnt notice the Tin Man but I may have missed him.) Raimi plays on nostalgia throughout the film. The Yellow Brick Road and Emerald City recall their 1939 counterparts. Oscar Diggs who goes by the stage name of Oz (James Franco) is given companions on his trek including a flying monkey Finley (Zach Braff) and a China Girl (Joey King). The movie also employs its predecessors tactic of using black-and-white (with a 43 aspect ratio) for the Earth-bound scenes and brilliant Technicolor (with 2.351) for Oz. And as in The Wizard of Oz actors play dual roles parts in the 1905 Kansas prologue and larger roles in Oz. This is true of Braff King and Michelle Williams. The screenplay credited to Mitchell Kapner and David-Lindsay-Abaire uses the thin backstory provided for The Wizard in Baums series to develop the framework for a full movie. On Earth Oz is a failed conjurer traveling with the ""Baum Brothers"" circus whos more interested in seducing his assistants than expanding his repertoire. One day while escaping in a hot air balloon from an enraged strongman Oz is caught in a tornado and deposited in Oz. There he is greeted by the witch Theodora (Mila Kunis) who believes he represents the fulfillment of a prophecy made by the late king. She escorts Oz to Emerald City where he meets Theodoras sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz). In order to claim the throne however he must travel into the Dark Forest and kill the Wicked Witch. Somewhat reluctantly Oz agrees but the so-called ""Wicked Witch"" turns out to be Glinda the Good Witch (Williams) and he learns that the real Wicked Witch was one of the sisters he left behind. Visually Oz the Great and Powerful delivers in 2-D and 3-D. The color is scintillating and the CGI is used to good effect to represent a technological update to the look and feel of the 1939 film without tarting things up too much. Raimi includes plenty of visuals that allow the 3-D to pay off with things flying out of the screen at the audience and a tornado that breaks through the screen and seems to be hovering in the front of the theater. Still the 2-D offers more ""pop"" where the color is concerned. Oz the Great and Powerful is in the tradition of Tim Burtons recent Alice in Wonderland a beloved classic story that finds new life brought to life by a director with a strong vision and an understanding of how to appeal to family audiences. Raimi tones down any ghoulish tendencies in favor of a film that is only a little frightening. He uses James Franco who appeared in all three of his Spider-Man movies effectively eliciting a performance from the actor that mixes the charm of the con-man with the charisma of the true hero. Oz gets to experience the character arc of the jerk who treads the path to redemption. Williams Kunis and Weisz make a more fetching trio of witches than those in Macbeth although one of them develops a bad complexion to go along with a surprisingly weak interpretation of a role that should have been deliciously devilish. Oh and Bruce Campbell makes his usual cameo. Oz the Great and Powerful doesnt offer much in the way of suspense or surprises. It is after all working toward a known conclusion getting all the pieces in place for Dorothys arrival. Still its a well-crafted story told with plenty of imagination and energy and more than a little heart. The movie runs a little over two hours but doesnt wear out its welcome and theres some ingenuity in how the climax unfolds. It cant fully overcome the flaw of having the two villains escape but theres no way around that. As they skulk away toward the end of Oz the Great and Powerful we know that a greater adventure awaits.

And because of our affection for the L. Frank Baum books and the 1939 screen musical we demand a lot from a return visit. Not only do we expect to have our childlike sense of wonderment restored but we want to see the proper reverence paid to what has come before.Thats what the colorful ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" attempts to do. Its an earnest and obvious prequel that focuses on an unsuspecting huckster ""wizard"" (James Franco) and the three witches (played by Michelle Williams Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz) intrigued by him. Which of the women ultimately goes green? Thats part of the fun here. A scene from ""Oz the Great and Powerful."" (AP Photo/Disney Enterprises) Given the expectations its a challenging assignment to please generations old and new and director Sam Raimi (2002s ""Spider-Man"") does his almighty best. The screenplay by Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abiare hits highs and lows while Raimi struggles to rise above the blockbuster magnitude of this overblown Disney production with its grandiose over-the-top CGI 3-D effects and its straining attempts to rekindle nostalgic magic. Since the original Judy Garland film was produced by another studio the filmmakers took deliberate care to emulate what was on the page not the screen perhaps hindering what Raimi might have achieved.Advertisement Watching ""Oz"" unfold you can almost sense the presence of a studio guy lingering on the sidelines clipboard in hand as he ticks off all the calculated boxes that will guarantee this 200 million baby will be a hit. No need to worry Disney. This is no ""John Carter"" flop just a film that could have been better.Oh it has its moments of movie magic in moving scenes where the orphaned miniature porcelain China Girl -- the films best character -- appears. But too often ""Oz"" caves to blockbuster conventions preoccupied with creating a visual template to make Oz magnificent when Ozs magnificence has more to do with the heart and the soul rather than the spectacle of large blooming flowers and cascading waterfalls. ""Oz"" starts off putting its worst foot forward. An overly long black-and-white sequence set at the Kansas traveling carnival relies too heavily on juvenile humor and is ill-paced and choppy. It leans on Francos charm as Oscar Diggs (aka Oz) a flirty carny magician with commitment issues and magic tricks up his sleeve. Franco is miscast in the lead lacking a needed edge and because of that he lapses too often on his Cheshire catlike grin and twinkly eyes.You expect things will pick up once the magician bolts in a hot-air balloon and after twirling around through a tornado plunks down in Oz. But too much CGI is thrown at us. We need more breathing room as we ease back into the surreally magical worlds comforting folds.Its here that the up-and-coming wizard encounters the various witches and the performance from each actress is quite good. As the clingy fashion-forward Theodora Kunis is seductive and volatile. Williams is luminous and conveys a doe-eyed innocence that captures Glinda. But its Weisz as the control-freaky and ambitious Evanora who has the most fun. The exceptional costumes by Gary Jones and Michael Kutsch and the makeup artistry certainly help set the tone and when one witch goes green the actress playing the role gets into the right spirit.While on the road to save this world from the clutches of the Wicked Witch Oz meets up with some new faces. One of the best new acquaintances is the winged monkey Finley (voiced by Zach Braff) who becomes indebted to the new wizard. Braff provides the comic relief and has nice timing.But besides China Girl no one else sent me over the rainbow. I like many will always prefer the company that Dorothy kept in the 1939 musical The Tin Man the Cowardly Lion the Scarecrow and Toto too. And while I enjoyed traveling down the Yellow Brick Road once again with the wizard and Raimi I left this ""Oz"" feeling one thing that I wanted to watch the Judy Garland movie to see some real cinematic magic.OZ The Great and Powerful   1/2 Rating PG (for sequences of action and scary images and brief mild language) Cast James Franco Rachel Weisz Michelle Williams and Mila Kunis Director Sam Raimi Running time 2 hours 7 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Talend Silicon Valleys latest tech IPO has a strong debutSource Tesla looking at cameras radar in Florida crashCartoons Hillary Clinton makes history Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

They conjure up so many wonderful wizardly things Judy Garland in pigtails (before that horrible tightness set in); Ray Bolger pointing at his straw head; Bert Lahrs juddery fisticuffs; the madly cheerful munchkins; ""Toto too""; and if youre old enough the once-a-year Thanksgiving television showing that spurred so many Americans to shell out finally for color sets. Make sure to say those words before you see Disneys Oz the Great and Powerful which will surely wipe the smile off your face. No the movie is not a desecration -- there wasnt enough left for Disney to desecrate after the Warner Bros. legal team got through threatening copyright infringement. (L. Frank Baums Oz books are in the public domain; the 1939 Garland musical isnt.) But aside from a trio of witches that can hold its own with Eastwicks in the dishiness department Oz the Great and Powerful is a peculiarly joyless occasion. A Thats an extra shame because the premise is good -- more in line with Mark Twains prankish A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthurs Court than anything Baum came up with in his thirteen subsequent Oz books. The idea is to go back to a time before Dorothy and chart the journey from Kansas to Oz of the ""wonderful"" wizard himself -- here called Oscar Diggs and played by James Franco as a traveling carnival magician who applies himself most diligently to the trick of getting women to sleep with him. The black-and-white Kansas prologue is a treat not because its especially witty but for what it portends. Long ago director Sam Raimi was an adolescent Super-8 filmmaker with a talent for handmade special effects and he obviously relishes Oscars primitive sleight of hand that mixture of honest showmanship and flimflam. But I cant imagine Raimi had much say about the characters that come onboard once Oscar is carried off in a hot-air balloon by a funnel cloud -- once the screen widens the color seeps in and we meet the talking flying monkey (with the grating voice of Zach Braff) and sassy little China Doll. The banter is from hunger (despite a script co-written by playwright David Lindsay-Abaire) and Franco is the least convincing actor Ive seen addressing creatures to be computer-generated later. Franco is unconvincing generally tamping down the passion ironicizing everything out. It wouldnt take much to energize this chiseler who meets the lovely young witch Theodora (Mila Kunis) and pretends to be the wizard foretold by a vision who will free Oz from enslavement -- partly to seduce her partly to gain access to the kingdoms stores of gold. Its possible Francos modern-sounding stammers and shrugs opposite actors playing it straight are meant in the spirit of Bob Hopes hipster cowards -- or those of Woody Allen who cited Hope among his inspirations for Sleeper and Love and Death. But Franco doesnt have the comebacks. Hes playing a noncommittal character in a noncommittal way so that you want to scream ""This isnt a performance-art project Youre carrying a movie"" (Franco doesnt always give so little of himself. He was all there as an incantatory Allen Ginsberg in Howl and hes fully plugged into his dumb part as a Florida drug dealer in the asinine Spring Breakers.) Songs would have helped get this lead balloon off the ground (imagine The Wizard of Oz without the numbers) but Im guessing Disney didnt want to draw any more comparisons to Victor Flemings 1939 classic. But the movie needs some kind of wild card some chance for Raimi to show the mischievous exuberance (if not the gore) of The Evil Dead or the soul of Spider-Man 2. The shrieking clawing gypsy of his Drag Me to HellA who spews bodily fluids all over the heroines car would have taught these witches of Oz a spell or two. Kunis is a charming comedienne with an eager open face (her breakout turn isnt in Oz The Great and Powerful but in her widely viewed London junket interview with a wannabe Hugh Grant) but shes out of her depth in a role that requires her to go from impossibly naive to mythically vindictive -- especially without good lines. But Weiszs Evanora and Williamss Glinda are deliciously stylized creations. Weisz is all crisp and insouciant -- until she shows her fiendish spirit. Williams gently sends up Glindas beatific aura while remaining radiantly blonde and pure. The two of them have the best scene in which Evanora gets a palpable kick out of torturing the good witch before the populace of Oz. Its nastier than the rest of the movie -- and the first time the actors look as if theyre enjoying themselves. Its also a rare scene without Oz the Small and Muddled.

Though too much of it is borrowed. One could contend thats the nature of prequels They must link themselves inextricably to the thing we know. Yes writers Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire based their script on the works of L. Frank Baum. But this 3-D adventure is shaped by a certain 1939 movie starring a young Judy Garland. It even opens in a black-and-white Kansas with a twister a-comin. Of course Miss Dorothy Gale is nowhere in sight and neither is her little dog. Instead ""Oz"" directed by Sam Raimi recounts how the Land of Oz and its Emerald City came to get its man behind the curtain. It also tells the story of how two witches got so darn wicked in the first place. Michelle Williams gives a luminous but grounded turn as Glinda the Good. Rachel Weisz and Mila Kunis portray sisters Evanora and Theodora. Ones strategically nasty the other turns toward the darkness out of hurt. None of them -- good or evil -- are as interesting or refreshing as the complicated roommates of the blockbuster musical ""Wicked."" James Franco is all toothsome smiles as Oscar Diggs a hustler/magician working the circus circuit in Kansas. ""My friends call me Oz"" he tells Theodora all a-twinkle when his hot-air balloon makes an unexpected landing in a Technicolor land of unusual flora and fauna and a diverse citizenry aching for a wizard to fulfill a prophesy. Its hard to think of Kunis as naive as her character. With her Bette Davis eyes one gets the sense the actress sees through everything. The script robs her of that innate intelligence. And the scenes between Theodora and Oscar so central to this movies plot reveal the weakness of this outing. ""Oz"" strays from its yell0w-brick path every time it teases romance thwarted or otherwise. It finds its way back onto the magical route when it hews to a more egalitarian saga of people rising to the occasion of their own liberty. A number of the visual effects are indeed special. But many are also movie-makings version of gilding a lily. After all Evanoras flying squadron of primates are only slightly more menacing for being recast as sharp-fanged baboons. The tornado that carries Oscar up up and away in his beautiful balloon is impressive. And his zero-gravity moment in the twister is a thing of momentary beauty but it still doesnt trump the wonder of the one Dorothy awoke in. Raimi director of the first ""Spider-Man"" trilogy but also the cult classic ""The Evil Dead"" uses 3-D as he might in a horror flick. Shards of wood pierce the hot-air balloons wicker basket. Spears thrown by henchmen appear to rain down on the audience. Cool. Barely. Because by now arent those gestures just the 3-D equivalent of a magician pulling a bouquet out of thin air? If all this sounds harsher than seems fair for a movie with many a bright spot chalk it up -- some -- to the DNA encoding of ""The Wizard of Oz"" on my soul. So let us take a moment to praise two great and surprisingly powerful characters a winged monkey and a wee girl made out of china. Because so much human wonder resides in these two creations of make-up puppetry digital effects and lovely performances. While its nice to see actor Zach Braff (""Scrubs"") as Bob Oscars assistant in Kansas its even better to spend time with him once hes in Oz. He provides the voice of Finley the expressive little monkey in the bell-hop get-up. His nattering asides are often as insightful as they are hilarious. Like Braff 13-year-old Joey King does double duty. First she appears in the black-and-white Kansas. With a fine bit of hocus-pocus Oscar makes a believer out of a little girl watching his show from her wheelchair. Cure me she says. He cant. Later when Oscar and Finley come upon a place called China Town all that can be heard amid the ruins is stifled sobs of a little porcelain child. He rescues her. She joins the journey. With China Girl and Finley at his side as he heads off to destroy the wand of the witch he believes to be wicked Oscar becomes a more worthy hero. And the films journey becomes funny and poignant and memorable simultaneously. Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 lkennedydenverpost.com or twitter.com/bylisakennedy ""OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL.""

Part of what she discovers on her voyage over the rainbow is that apparently heroic magical and/or much-admired folk -- such as the Wizard of Oz -- will probably turn out to be no better than anybody else. Now that Im a parent I realize that Oz is the father figure in the movie Hes not a bad man but not someone who can solve all his childrens problems for them either. All he can really do is appreciate them for who they are so that they learn to appreciate themselves.But is Oz someone we care to know more about? Maybe.As much as I enjoyed Sam Raimis new movie which is breezy and bright in myriad dimensions I doubt his story will exert a comparable hold on the popular imagination for generations to come. Dads just arent that interesting -- not even to other dads. L. Frank Baum wrote 13 sequels to his most popular novel but so far as I know he never hit on the idea of a prequel. Ingeniously scripted by Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" mimics the movement and character arc of the original. It begins in the Midwest in black-and-white and then falls to a Technicolor Neverland in the eye of a twister.

At least he has the decency to be embarrassed that hes not the magical savior everyone seems to be expecting. He says he aspires to greatness even if he never seems likely to stretch for it. Franco doesnt quite get there for me in this role. Hes an unconvincing fraud and a shaky charlatan -- too young perhaps to fool anyone except himself. Or maybe hes just too contemporary to pass as a 19th century illusionist. Reportedly Robert Downey Jr. and Johnny Depp turned down the role and either might have played him with more aplomb. Presumably they were wary of messing with a solid gold classic but while ""Oz"" does present a wide target for critics they shouldnt have worried Director Sam Raimi (""The Amazing Spider-Man"" ""The Evil Dead"") takes care to honor the original in spirit and in style. It may be an impossible job but hes surpassed reasonable expectations. The production design and the saturated colors are close enough that this movie really does work as a prequel (albeit in 3-D) and while the CGI is unmistakably 21st century Raimis unironic celebration of pure artifice does suggest a continuum of sorts. Todays fashion for green screen and chroma key is not so far removed from the back projection and studio sets of Hollywoods Golden Age. Because the Land of Oz exists outside our reality even the most ersatz effects -- butterfly trees and flowers that toll like bells -- are fair game. In this place of garish unnatural wonders and exotic fauna (Zach Braff turns up in the form of a diminutive winged monkey) the bewildered magician is swept off his feet by not one but three magnificent witches -- Mila Kunis Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams -- one after the other each appealing to his better judgment and worst instincts and none copping to the wickedness that we know will show its hand eventually. Will our flawed hero measure up to the fix in which he finds himself? And how with nothing but an army of peaceniks to counter the witches Winkies? The new ""Oz"" falls short of the 1939 ""Oz"" in charm and innocence and certainly in songs (there is only one a brief jokey number from the Munchkins). But as family entertainment its hard to fault such a rapturous spectacle and astute suspenseful piece of storytelling. A true fantasist Raimi has conjured up a valentine to the imagination to smoke and mirrors and to the movies as a magical space where we might envisage and possibly even realize our better selves.

But the nostalgia approach is unnecessary. This generic hodgepodge of fairy tale cliches and garish CGI falls flat on its own terms.Leading the slog is James Franco who does for Oz what he did for the Oscars in 2011. Prancing about a Disneyfied magical kingdom with a wincing grin perpetually on the verge of a smirk Franco has difficulty making even a self-professed con man seem whole. You get the feeling he either doesnt know what movie hes in or doesnt particularly care.In his defense you can hardly blame him. The first half of Oz in which Francos sham small-town magician gets sucked into a tornado and crash lands his hot air balloon in a candy-colored wonderland presents a master class in how not to get a story off the ground. Our charlatan enchanter meets a wide-eyed well-dressed lass (Mila Kunis) who claims to be a witch. He encounters a benevolent flying monkey (sacrilege) voiced by Zach Braff and a spunky china doll (Joey King). They walk. They discuss the need for a wizard to save the kingdom from a wicked witch. They banter for easy laughs. Then they walk some more.By the time a second witch (Rachel Weisz) appears and then a third (Michelle Williams) Oz has gotten nowhere and not particularly fast. Were supposed to connect to the ersatz wizards sense of guilt -- heavy lies the heart that wears the fraud -- but Franco plays the part like a walking air quote. He never comes close to inviting us in.The saddest part of all this is the identity of the director. Sam Raimi has been a visionary filmmaker with the range to excel at everything from tongue-in-cheek horror (the original Evil Dead movies) to rural noir (the sublime A Simple Plan). The mandates of digital spectacle brought him down with the third Spider-Man movie but that was already a fatigued franchise. With Oz he gets knocked cold by a falling tent pole and consumed by the rhythms and shallow aesthetics of what currently passes for blockbuster filmmaking. Say it aint so Sam.Fleeting moments of enchantment keep the eyes open in fits and starts including a finale that brings a new twist to the classic man-behind-the-curtain chicanery and pays homage to the pioneers of early cinema. But the visual wonder is cheapened by shoddy 3-D -- theres rarely another kind -- that blurs background motion and traffics in the tired gimmick of dangerous objects flying through the screen.Oz the Great and Powerful somehow manages to be both slavish to its hallowed template (when convenient) and completely tone-deaf to the magic that made it a one-of-a-kind cultural milestone. Thats a not-so-neat trick. Its also the primary form of black magic practiced by this royal scam.Follow Chris Vognar on Twitter at chrisvognar.OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL(D) Directed by Sam Raimi.

Merie Weismiller Wallace/Disney Enterprises/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Video 3-8-13 Oz movie review Monitor Movie Guide ""Oz The Great and Powerful"" is the latest in a seemingly endless stream of Hollywood fairy-tale redos. Its a bit better than ""Jack the Giant Slayer"" but not by much. Directed by Sam Raimi its a prequel to ""The Wizard of Oz"" that attempts to answer the question ""How did the wizard become the wizard?""In this version our wizard started out as Oscar Diggs (James Franco) a small-time Kansas carnival magician who is whisked via hot air balloom into the Land of Oz where as imagined by Raimi and screenwriters Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire he encounters not one but three witches Theodora (Mila Kunis) Evanora (Rachel Weisz) and Glinda (Michelle Williams). Glinda of course is good - or to be precise Good.Franco is affable and helps tone down the films overly bright and overscaled production values. (The 3-D is passable). Williams is radiant without being sappy. Its nice to see Munchkins again not to mention Quadlings. But long stretches of ""Oz"" are lumbering and inspiration-free. (Also Dorothy-free.) Im no fan of ""Wicked"" the musical ""Oz"" prequel but at least it had some big-time energy going for it. Raimis film is supposed to be about magic but magic is in scant supply.

Once upon a time a movie spinoff of ""The Wizard of Oz"" might have sounded like a joke similar to the ""Graduate"" sequel that Buck Henry proposed in ""The Player."" Yet there actually is a literary sequel to ""The Graduate"" by the original novelist Charles Webb and in 1985 there was a movie sequel to the ""The Wizard of Oz"" called ""Return to Oz"" that few people remember. Plus theres the popular book and musical spinoff ""Wicked.""Oh and the 1939 ""Wizard of Oz"" was not the first movie version of L. Frank Baums best-known novel which became an eight-minute silent in 1910 and a feature-length silent in 1925.In a cultural marketplace where nothing is sacred everything must be judged on its terms. And for the record the good folks at Disney insist that ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is not officially a prequel to the Judy Garland classic whose rights are owned by another studio but is a standalone adaptation of an earlier Baum story. Factoring all the disclaimers about homage and originality the oracle declares that ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is a straw-headed tin-hearted lily-livered monstrosity that relies on smoke and mirrors to fleece the gullible. Just like its dubious hero.To say that laid-back James Franco is miscast as fast-talking carnival magician Oscar ""Oz"" Diggs is like saying he wasnt the greatest host in the history of Academy Awards telecasts. The more suitably antic Robert Downey Jr. and Johnny Depp were considered for the part before Franco wandered into the picture with his stoner grin.In 1905 Kansas conniving Oz uses a hot-air balloon to flee a vengeful husband on a monochromatic midway and is blown over the rainbow to a colorful wide-screen land that happens to share his name. His helpful new friend Theodora (Mila Kunis clad in an anachronistic leather pants and stiletto-heeled boots) believes he is the wizard who is preordained to save the kingdom from an evil witch. Theodora is a witch too and so is her sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz) who informs Oz that he can claim a chamber of gold after he slays rival witch Glinda (Michelle Williams). So he travels down the yellow-brick road and acquires two sidekicks an annoying flying monkey (voice of Zach Braff) and an eerie porcelain doll (voice of Joey King).But in the land of Oz its tricky to pick which witch is wickedest and when the wannabe wizard waffles its war. The finale of the film is almost worth the price of admission as Oz uses carnival-caliber make-believe (and actual smoke and mirrors that emulate 3-D cinema) to bamboozle the bad witches. By the end of the two-hour 10-minute movie director Sam Raimi (""Spider-Man"") proves he understands spectacle but not the deeper dreams of the people who consume it.Its a long road to get fed such sour apples.What ""Oz the Great and Powerful""  Two stars out of four  Rating PG  Run time 210  Content Some fantasy violence and scary images Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 08 2013 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Mar. 08 2013 339PM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Sam Raimi Written by Mitchell Kapner David Lindsay-Abaire Starring James Franco Michelle Williams Mila Kunis Rachel Weisz Classification PG Year 2013 Country USA Language English The new Disney movie Oz the Great and Powerful which is expected to rescue this years drooping box office has the cards stacked in its favour. Theres global brand recognition thanks to the still-popular 1939 Judy Garland-starring film and the smash Broadway musical Wicked. Theres a successful marketing campaign in which Disney apes its previous billion-dollar success with Alice in Wonderland which shares the new films producers and production designer. With director Sam Raimi of the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man movies James Franco as the star and a trio of sexy witches (Rachel Weisz Michelle Williams Mila Kunis) this 200-million special-effects vehicle appears to have everything going for it. Screen grab from online trailer for ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" Movies Oz the Great and Powerful The official trailer video Video Michelle Williams and Mila Kunis bring Oz to Comic-Con Everything until you draw back the curtain and realize this is a really a Blunder-full Blizzard of Blahs. From the briefly hopeful opening few minutes - shot in black-and-white and presented in the archaic nearly square Academy screen ratio - it soon becomes clear this isnt working. The problems range from a miscast James Franco to a thinly written screenplay by Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire to tentative off-rhythm pacing from Raimi. And unfortunately it has the model of the 1939 film to remind us how lacking in delight this version is.Unable to develop the Cowardly Lion Tin Man and Scarecrow from the original film (copyright issues) the writers have created weak analogues of them while the colourful CGI-created world of Oz while eye-popping has a placid plastic artifice to it that feels the opposite of magic.The film begins in 1905 where magician and would-be inventor Oscar Diggs (Franco) is a pompous womanizing circus act working the Kansas fair circuit. But he fails to impress the hicks with his suspended woman and various other tricks. From the outset Franco seems too self-conscious and detached to suggest the self-importance his character demands.After rejecting an old girlfriend (Michelle Williams) Oscar escapes from an unpleasant imbroglio by jumping into a hot-air balloon. Shortly after the balloon is caught up in a twister of the same variety that swept Dorothy to Oz in the other film. Despite the developments in special effects over the past 74 years this sequence seems a lot less fun or scary than the original. After landing (not on a witch) Oscar discovers that his arrival has been prophesied. The story goes that a wizard shall arrive and that hell be the game-changer in a battle between three beautiful witch sisters for the throne of Oz. First he meets the naive witch Theodora (Kunis) who develops a crush on him. Then theres her older sister the beautiful scheming Evanora (Weisz) who convinces him that he must defeat the wicked Glinda (Williams again) who lives in the dark forest in order to gain the palaces riches.Opportunistic Oscar calling himself Oz strikes out to the forest and is soon accompanied by a mended china doll (voiced by Joey King) and a flying monkey in a bell-hop suit (voiced by Zach Braff.) The wicked witch Glinda of course turns out to be quite the opposite of her advance billing and an ally to the man she instantly recognizes as a bogus wizard setting the stage for a showdown between duelling sisters.Some of the visual effects are decent especially when the characters travel inside giant bubbles - but the landscape of Oz has the look of a sixties Day-Glo painting. The flying baboons are a poor substitute for the nasty flying monkeys of the first film and the eventual bombastic fireworks and holographic-projection display at the films end seem less about ""magic"" than proof the special-effects designers saw too many Pink Floyd concerts.At the core though the problem is Franco who lacks the mischief and energy to raise this mediocre material to passable entertainment. Unlike Robert Downey Jr. who was originally cast for the role he doesnt suggest an ironic take on the material. And unlike Johnny Depps performance in Alice in Wonderland which is obviously Disneys model he fails to forge the characters eccentricity into something strange and subversive. A slacker with a selfish streak who turns into a slacker with a more benign disposition is not a compelling character arc.Its another letdown that The Wizard of Oz - a film thats been celebrated for its campy charms for decades - is followed by a film woefully lacking in spirited humour. Williams as Glinda aims for a kind of amorphous warmth without the silly chirpiness of Billie Burkes performance. As for the other major actors Weisz though okay could have benefited from playing her role with more campy zest while Kunis (in a role that becomes Margaret Hamiltons green-faced crone) at least gives her performance gusto but since the bad witches evil is so joyless their predictable defeat yields no satisfaction.

""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is certainly big and bright -- with Candyland colors duck-and-cover 3D effects and a climax that brings on not one but two evil witches along with plenty of noisy explosions. But wheres the gentle sentiment? The quiet moral lessons? The warm comforting message of family and home and realizing that the thing you needed most was really inside you all the time? Left somewhere in the rubble of the old MGM backlot I guess next to a tattered picnic hamper and a rusted oil can. Of course ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is based on the original L. Frank Baum books not the Judy Garland movie. For legal reasons it has to be. So dont expect ruby slippers ""Over the Rainbow"" or any of the other old Hollywood additions. (Although director Sam Raimi still cant resist mimicking that famous sepia-to-Technicolor opening -- only in his case going from a boxy black-and-white look on Earth to wide-screen color in Oz.) No instead what were focused on is a sort of a prequel to the famous story explaining how a mediocre carnival magician found himself swept up in a Kansas twister and deposited in a magical place. Which immediately proclaimed him the great Wizard who had been prophesied -- and was now going to lead them out of civil war. Not exactly the gig he was looking for. But when this wiz bumps into witches who just happen to look like Michelle Williams Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz -- well he decides to stick around. Unfortunately a couple of problems immediately hop out like rabbits from a hat. The first is the movies style. Raimi is a director with a mischievous sense of humor; you just know that the bratty prankishness of 3D with pointy things flying out of the screen and right at the audiences eyes is something hes yearned to do since the first ""Evil Dead."" But once we get to Oz the movies -- frankly -- ugly. The landscapes are too much. The colors are too bright. Its all sticky-sweet excess like a case of Strawberry Shortcake food poisoning. Sadly that lack of charm extends to our hero. As written the Wizard is supposed to be a libidinous coward. Its an archetype that served Bob Hope for at least 20 years (and with a few refinements Woody Allen for probably 20 more). But James Franco just comes off as smarmy. He mugs and flaps his gums but hes not funny and his commitment-phobia plays like ugly egotism. (Really? You have women who look like Williams and Kunis in love with you and youd rather keep playing the field? Really?) Both actresses are very good particularly Kunis; she has one deliciously gruesome moment where she cries tears of acid and decked out in pearls and upswept hair she looks like a baby Natalie Wood. She gets all the films best scenes. And there are two nicely imagined delicately drawn characters -- a helpful flying monkey (reminiscent inexplicably of Red Buttons) and a tiny living porcelain doll. She comes from -- wait for it -- China Town and shes a small bit of real movie magic. So thankfully is the big climax which both makes a few non-actionable nods to the original movie and shows the good and peaceful people of Oz fighting a non-violent war through trickery con games and feats of good old midway magic. But in the end like the Wizard thats all this movie has -- a lot of flashy expensive tricks. And neither the brain to use them wisely nor the courage to dare to try something real. Ratings note The film contains a few too-scary scenes for toddlers. Oz the Great and Powerful (PG) Disney (130 min.) Directed by Sam Raimi. With James Franco Michelle Williams Mila Kunis Rachel Weisz.

Disney ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" a Disney release is rated PG for sequences of action and scary images and brief mild language. Running time 130 minutes. Two stars out of four. By CHRISTY LEMIRE Associated Press ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" aims for nostalgia in older viewers who grew up on ""The Wizard of Oz"" and still hold the classic dear while simultaneously enchanting a newer younger audience. It never really accomplishes either successfully. A prequel to the groundbreaking 1939 film ""Oz"" can be very pretty but also overlong and repetitive with a plot thats more plodding that dazzling. Director Sam Raimi also is trying to find his own balance here between creating a big-budget 3-D blockbuster and placing his signature stamp of kitschy darkly humorous horror. Hes done the lavish CGI thing before with diminishing results in the ""Spider-Man"" trilogy but here he has the daunting task of doing so while mining an even more treasured pop -culture phenomenon. The results are understandably inconsistent. ""Oz"" features a couple of fun performances a handful of witty lines some clever details and spectacular costumes. And its all punctuated by a Danny Elfman score that serves as a reminder of how similar this effects-laden extravaganza is to the latter-day (and mediocre) work of Elfmans frequent collaborator Tim Burton - specifically 2010s ""Alice in Wonderland"" also from Disney. At its center is a miscast James Franco co-star of Raimis ""Spider-Man"" movies as the circus huckster who becomes the reluctant Wizard of Oz. On the page (in the script from Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire) Francos selfish scheming womanizer provides an early glimpse of the famous fraud that Dorothy Gale and her posse of new pals will go on to expose. But Franco seems too boyish for the role; hes neither charismatic nor self-loathing enough and his performance frequently consists of hammy goofing. So when his character does have a change of heart and decides to accept his destiny as a noble and inspiring leader it rings hollow. Before he gets there though he must journey through the Technicolor-tinted splendor of this wildly dreamlike place - much of which resembles one of those Thomas Kinkade paintings youd see at the mall - not once but many times which feels redundant. But then again so does the whole structure of the film itself. Like Dorothy Francos Oscar Diggs is whisked away from sepia-toned rural Kansas of 1905 (projected in slightly boxier Academy ratio a nice touch) through a tornado to the vibrantly hued magical land that just happens to bear his nickname Oz. Like Dorothy he walks along the yellow brick road with some new companions who have ties to his old life back home a wisecracking flying monkey (voiced by Zach Braff channeling Billy Crystal) and a spritely but resourceful china doll (voiced by Joey King). And like Dorothy once he reaches his destination he must face a witch. But which witch is which? You see there are three one of whom is the truly wicked one. First he meets the beautiful and naive Theodora (Mila Kunis) who believes he is the wonderful wizard her father the king said would come to save Oz in a prophecy before he was killed. Kunis is weirdly stiff and subdued in these early scenes which squander her inherent spark; later as Theodora evolves she screeches in a tone thats reminiscent of her ""Family Guy"" character the awkward teenage Meg screaming at her brother Chris to get out of her room. Next comes Theodoras sophisticated and deceitful sister Evanora (a funny vampy Rachel Weisz) who rules over Emerald City as its protector and fills Oz in on the riches that could be his if he fulfills the prophecy kills the Wicked Witch and becomes the king. Finally theres Glinda the Good Witch played by a sweetly ethereal Michelle Williams. She also appears in the Kansas prelude as a young woman whos clearly smitten by Oz and hesitant to accept a marriage proposal from another man. (If she marries him by the way her last name will be Gale.) ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" plays with the notion of making people believe through spectacle and trickery - that what you see is more important than what you actually get. Its Ozs bread and butter and its a primary tenet of the moviemaking process itself of course. But this time something is missing in the magic.

"Review Oz the Great and Powerful a rough slog on the yellow brick road - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview Oz the Great and Powerful a rough slog on the yellow brick roadSam Raimis visually stunning prequel to The Wizard of Oz is a partially effective jumble that doesnt really catch fire until its almost too late.March 07 2013|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Sometimes sweet sometimes scary sometimes sour ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is a film that doesnt know its own mind. A partially effective jumble whose elements clash rather than cohere this solid but not spectacular effort stubbornly refuses to catch fire until its almost too late.As directed by Sam Raimi who departed from his horror film roots (""The Evil Dead"") to turn out the high-grossing family-friendly ""Spider-Man"" trilogy ""Oz"" exhibits some of the same tonal duality that marks its makers career. Despite the considerable amount of time effort and cash invested in it this film remains an unfocused fairy tale with the nasty bits left in which is not always a good idea.As a prequel of sorts to the beloved Judy Garland-starring ""The Wizard of Oz"" designated by the Library of Congress as the most-watched film ever this version certainly has giant shoes to fill. Copyright issues prevent ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" from mentioning signature moments from the 1939 film such as Dorothys iconic ruby slippers but the new movie does feature munchkins a magician (James Franco) and a trio of witches (Mila Kunis Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams) as it fills us in on how the world order Dorothy discovered came into being.REVIEWS More reviews from the TimesWhat ""Oz"" does do well and this has proved to be no easy task is effectively use its 3-D format. With Robert Stromberg as production designer and Peter Deming as cinematographer this film succeeds in making the Land of Oz look completely magical and strange. Which it very much needs to do to compensate for acting and writing that veer toward the ordinary more than they should.As written by Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire this ""Oz"" begins like the Garland classic in Kansas in black and white. The year this time is 1905 and the setting is the rundown Baum Bros. Circus (a nod to L. Frank Baum who wrote the original Oz novels). In dusty tents a magician named Oscar Diggs (Franco) holds forth amid the alter egos of characters he will later meet in Oz.Though he bills himself as ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" Oscar Diggs is neither. Francos portrayal calls to mind the actors self-satisfied turn as host of the Academy Awards giving the magician a callow pleased-with-himself aura (he is accurately described later in the film as ""selfish slightly egotistical and a fibber""). While having Franco start out this way is intentional the actor is frankly too adept at being irritating so much so that his presence makes it harder to enjoy the rest of the movie.A practiced seducer of women Oscar has no use for the friendship of his assistant Frank (Zach Braff) and doesnt know what to say when a young teenager in a wheelchair (Joey King) asks during his magic show if he can make her walk again. When old flame Annie (Williams) tells him shes going to be married to someone else he mocks her notions of probity. He doesnt want to be a good man he says but a great one a a combination of ""Harry Houdini and Thomas Edison all rolled into one."" He doesnt know hes about to get his chance.As in the 1939 original a tornado seems the only mode of transport from Kansas to the magical kingdom as Oscar is carried in by a hot air balloon. And magical this land certainly is with unusual flowers opening in glorious profusion and otherworldly pink butterflies filling the air. It is quite a 3-D sight and it needs to be to keep us involved while the story finds its legs.Oscars first order of business is rescuing Finley a flying talking monkey in a bellhops uniform and cap (Braff again) who becomes the newcomers sidekick and confidant a role news reports suggest was beefed up to help Francos low likability quotient.Next we encounter naive witch Theodora (Kunis) who is convinced that the magician is the prophesied wizard with great powers who has been expected to show up and free the land from the tyranny of the wicked witch.The man himself is not so sure but hes interested in the treasure that goes with the job. After meeting the more worldly Evanora (Weisz) and then the glowing blond Glinda (Williams again) Oscar is convinced he has to fake being a real wizard until the film reveals which of the trio is the wicked witch a bogus dilemma that confuses rather than helps the plot.This may sound straightforward on paper but the films pokey plot advances in fits and starts. There are moments of enchantment as when Oscar comes across tiny made-of-porcelain China Girl (King again). And there are moments of nastiness like attacks by flying baboons with sharp fangs and dispositions to match the kind of unnerving episodes even nominal family films now feel compelled to include.As the storys conclusion looms and Oscar is allowed to be more likable the whole project gets a new lease on life. The moral here is that we are capable of more than we know so how can we not be won over a especially if munchkins are involved? But ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is a rougher slog getting there than it needs to be.kenneth.turanlatimes.com-------------------------------Oz the Great and PowerfulRatingA PG for sequences of action and scary images and brief mild languageRunning timeA 2 hours 10 minutesPlayingA In general release PHOTOS AND MORE TIMELINE Violence in movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz PHOTOS Greatest box office flops MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESDisney welcomes its Oz as biggest 2013 debutMarch 10 2013Jack the Giant Slayer is slayed.

Dorothy the Scarecrow the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion dont even appear in this one which takes place some 30 years before the 1939 film back when the Wizard was just getting his start and the Wicked Witches of the East and West still looked really really good. Here youll find the 3-D almost as good as Ang Lees ""Life of Pi"" with the three dimensions in service of a much better story. Screenwriters David Lindsay-Abaire and Mitchell Kapner devise a satisfying history for ""Oz"" supposedly by going back to L. Frank Baums books. But watching the movie it becomes pretty clear that they kept the 1939 classic in mind thought about what might have happened years before and let their imaginations rip. Thats why the more you like the Judy Garland film the more you might appreciate ""Oz the Great and Powerful."" Appreciate. Enjoy. Admire. Be glad to see. Have fun with ... But as for love - well love will be harder to come by. ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" has one flaw that keeps it from lifting off and soaring Its 130 minutes long and thats just too much for a fairy tale. The individual scenes are so good that this is less a problem than it might sound and its hard to say what exactly should be cut - this is precisely the problem director Sam Raimi must have faced. But taken together the bulk seems wrong for the form. Everything else deserves praise and that includes the opening credits sequence done in black and white in lettering from the turn of the 20th century with the camera seeming to be flying toward the credits as a series of walls part and doors open. Its enough to make you start liking 3-D again and thats just the start. We meet Oz as a young carnival magician in 1905. Hes a fraud an opportunist and a lothario who is either a decent fellow underneath it all or only looks like one because hes handsome and played by James Franco. Afraid of poverty and a drab existence he chooses the life of a mountebank even when it means giving up the woman of his dreams. And then a tornado comes while he happens to be fleeing Kansas in a hot air balloon and he ends up in Oz.

Oscar Diggs (James Franco) and the witch Theodora (Mila Kunis) travel the Yellow Brick Road on their way to The Emerald City. Image 13 of 13 Oz the Great review Wonderful wizard 1 / 13 Back to Gallery Or he doesnt. Actually its possible to look at ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" as a dream from which young Oz never wakes up because hes dead - that hes a dreamer more like the girl in ""Pans Labyrinth"" than Dorothy. You might counter this by asking why he dreams of the same place and characters that Dorothy does but in the construct of this movie these just might be archetypes. Anyway just a thought something to play around with after youve seen the movie. Upon landing in Oz he meets Theodora (Mila Kunis) a vulnerable young woman who is struck by the coincidence that his name is Oz. She assumes he is the wizard foretold in prophecy and instantly falls in love with him. Pay attention to how shes dressed - Gary Jones costume design is more than vivid. Its psychologically astute. If the characters clothes make you feel reassured that means something. If a characters clothes make you uncomfortable and you dont know why that means something else. The meeting of Glinda the Good and Oz benefits from the inevitable emotional chemistry of Michelle Williams and Franco; that is from the combination of her deep-revolving purity and his benevolent wise-guy essence. Any Glinda whod appreciate Franco must have a fun streak just as any Oz liked by Williams must have unknown depths. But the most moving element in the film is the character of a porcelain doll whose legs are broken in an aerial attack by an evil witch. Time stands still in the best way for the scene in which Oz glues the dolls legs back together. Its a perfectly done scene with animation effects so seamless you forget to appreciate them. Instead youll get carried away by the delicacy of the images the sweetness of the moment and the power of the metaphor Good and gentleness - peoples lives - are porcelain while the world rains down bombs.

By Cary Darlingdfw.comPosted 249pm on Thursday Mar. 07 2013 Thursday Mar. 07 2013 Thursday Mar. 07 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Oz the Great and Powerful would probably knock em dead as the basis for an attraction at Disney World. Director Sam Raimis reinterpretation of The Wizard of Oz universe is loud and eye-poppingly colorful and thanks to 3-D theres enough stuff hurtling at you to make you feel like youve stepped into a meteor shower.But it doesnt make for a very good Disney film. Mildly diverting and clever in spots this Oz is certainly no bookend for the 1939 classic that introduced author L. Frank Baums fanciful adventure to a wider world.Raimis prequel conceit based on a script by Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire is to tell the wizards origin story. So the film opens in black and white as Oz (a miscast James Franco) lives one step above criminal. Hes a low-rent Kansas magician and charlatan who gets by on the carnival circuit using charm and moxie. While on the run from the strongman and his clown sidekick for some infraction Oz hops into a hot-air balloon gets swept into a tornado and lands of course in the magical kingdom of Oz where the film blooms into CGI-enhanced lollipop color.He is met by Theodora (Mila Kunis) one of the witches of this kingdom who informs him that he must be the wizard who has been prophesied to rescue them from the clutches of the one she dubs the Wicked Witch (Michelle Williams). But then he finds out that Theodora along with her sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz) may not be telling him the truth.Along with his new sidekicks -- Finley (Zach Braff) a flying monkey with a hint of attitude; China Girl a small girl made of china (Joey King); and a parades worth of tinkers farmers and munchkins -- Oz has to man up slay the evil one fall in love and live if not happily ever after then at least comfortably enough until Dorothy comes along.Because Raimi (Spider-Man) couldnt tread too closely to the original without infringing copyright part of the films fun comes from how the well-known concepts are reimagined. Theres a lion but hes not cowardly there are scarecrows but theyre not alive and the biggest Tin Man of all just may be Oz himself who needs to find a heart.Kudos to the technical teams that make Finley such an impressive and expressive melding of human and simian. He also gets some of the best lines. On top of that its amusing to see longtime Raimi stalwart Bruce Campbell -- the star of the directors early ""Evil Dead"" films -- in a cameo as one of the Emerald City gatekeepers.Yet like so many big-budget movies these days its hard to care much about whats going on especially as the film builds to its special-effects-driven conclusion. Francos smirking performance doesnt help.There may be enough here to keep younger children entertained but with Ozs 130-minute running time even they might get twitchy. (Plus parents take note the Wicked Witchs menacing flying baboons are a little on the scary side.)The Wizard of Oz certainly deserves a better successor. But the amusement-park ride will be awesome.Cary Darling 817-390-7571Twitter carydar Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

Starring Mila Kunis James Franco Michelle Williams Rachel Weisz Abigail Spencer Joey King Zach Braff Martin Klebba Ted Raimi Bill Cobbs Director Sam Raimi Running time 210 Release Opened Mar 8 2013  Editorial Review Wonderful? Not this wizard. By Ann HornadayFriday March 8 2013If you go see ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" youll most likely be handed 3-D glasses the better to appreciate an expensive lavishly produced special effects extravaganza and plop a few more dollars into Disneys coffers. But youll need to supply your own air quotes. A healthy sense of irony is needed not only to stomach the title -- the shifty wispy protagonist of this ""Wizard of Oz"" prequel is neither great nor powerful -- but also for most of the production which constantly falls short of the inflated expectations it has set up for itself. Starting with a woefully miscast James Franco in the title role continuing through a lame story line thats merely a warmed-over version of the 1939 movie adaptation and extending to visual effects that never approach the dazzlement and wonder of its revolutionary forbearer ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is a big over-processed misfire that with a little more care and ingenuity might have lived up to its name. When ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" opens Oscar Diggs (Franco) is working as a sideshow conjurer with a traveling circus in 1905 Kansas captured fittingly enough in the black-and-white square-framed format of old-timey cinema. After an interminable sludgily paced opening sequence during which Oscar (a.k.a. ""Oz"") breaks hearts and mistreats his faithful assistant Frank (Zach Braff) hes forced to make a quick escape from the midway via hot-air balloon at which point hes caught in a cyclone that plops him down in a brightly colored wide-screen world of enormous psychedelically hued flowers mysterious forests and a crystalline city made entirely of emerald. If that all sounds familiar its meant to ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" hews faithfully -- some might say slavishly -- to Victor Flemings ""The Wizard of Oz"" this time casting the man behind the curtain as the outsider who embarks on a heroic quest with the help of friends he makes along the way. In Ozs case these are a flying monkey named Finley (voiced by Braff) a delicate painted china doll (Joey King) and eventually a witch named Glinda (Michelle Williams) who enlists Oz to help her fight her evil counterpart Evanora (Rachel Weisz). Oz also meets a witch named Theodora played by the always-fetching Mila Kunis in a performance that for an actress who has shown such spirit and verve in previous films seems strangely un-focused and inert here (at least initially). Admittedly Kunis doesnt have much of a partner in Franco whose laid-back half-mast coolness bears no resemblance to the manipulative sharpie Oz is supposed to be. When Franco says the word ""prestidigitation"" behind his stoners grin its as if hes uttering it for the first time in English class. Time travel may be one element of the L. Frank Baum stories on which ""The Wizard of Oz"" and this incarnation are based but plopping a Gen-X California boy into a role that calls for swift instincts and shrewd alertness is an error from which ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" never recovers. The same could be said for a story that as written by Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire and directed by Sam Raimi feels like little more than an afterthought a lame attempt to cash in on the enduring appeal of ""The Wizard of Oz"" without providing any genuine imagination or innovation of its own. As Oz and his motley band travel down the Yellow Brick Road Raimi punctuates their journey with nods and references to the classic ""Oz"" film introducing a fierce lion an army of scarecrows and a field full of horses of a different color along the way (not to mention Munchkins and Winkie Guards). But whats meant to be an affectionate clever way of establishing continuity between the two narratives instead serves to remind viewers of the enduring superiority of the classic. As an origin story ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" comes up with some interesting theories especially having to do with the Wicked Witch of the East and her green-skinned sister. But mostly this movie seems designed merely to up an already bloated special-effects ante from the now-30-percent-more-terrifying flying monkeys to a prolonged explosive climactic sequence. Aside from some lyrical moments early on when flames and birds dart out of the sides of the frame 3-D technology adds little to an underwhelming endeavor. Like ""John Carter"" last year and ""Jack the Giant Slayer"" last week ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" qualifies as a cautionary tale not about the perils of ambition and selfishness but about the movie industrys misguided belief that it can distract the audience from a films narrative weaknesses with little more than flash and spectacle. That con might have worked with the rubes once upon a time but in case Hollywood hasnt noticed were not in Kansas anymore.Contains sequences of action and scary images and obscenity.

Credit Walt Disney Pictures Watch A Clip From Oz The Great And Powerful - These Go Kinda Fast These Go Kinda Fast Credit Walt Disney Pictures Watch A Clip From Oz The Great And Powerful - I Wanna Go With You I Wanna Go With You Credit Walt Disney Pictures Oz the Great and Powerful tells the story of how the Wizard came to Oz answering a question I suspect no one was asking but with considerable digital wizardry. The prequel begins in black and white just the way you hope it will with old-fashioned theatrical credits dissolving into a square-screened Kansas circa 1905. A carnival huckster (James Franco) accompanied by a grumpily loyal assistant (Zach Braff) is doing magic tricks for dwindling audiences in a circus tent and after the show telling marriage-minded farm girls they should stick with their prairie boyfriends because hes dreaming of bigger things. ""Kansas is full of good men"" he tells one sweet young thing (Michelle Williams) then adds ""I dont want to be a good man. I want to be a great one"" Almost immediately a tornado sweeps him from flat dusty black-and-white Kansas to a wide-screen land where theres not just color but serious topography -- waterfalls crashing down mountainsides jungles made of crystal rivers filled with sharp-toothed sprites. Also a seriously sexy witch (Mila Kunis) in black leather pants. Besides that friendly sorceress the huckster is soon teaming up with a talkative flying monkey (voiced by Braff) and a wounded but surprisingly fierce ceramic doll (Joey King) and heading off on a quest to thwart a wicked witch. Youll note that the screenplay (by Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire using characters and situations loosely based on L. Frank Baums Oz stories) mimics the 1939 movies structure and style pretty closely here. Monkeys and witches and dolls oh my. But director Sam Raimi the guy behind the Spider-Man trilogy has modern digital effects at his disposal so rather than just one theres a whole pasture full of those horses of a different color youve heard so much tell about. And when its time to conjure up a witch in a bubble -- a whole bunch of folks in bubbles actually -- well ... someday maybe thatll be one of those effects of a different magnitude youll hear so much tell about. Besides being roughly as gorgeous as it should be in a 200 million digital world everythings bigger in Raimis Oz -- and real-er which isnt necessarily a good thing. When the screenplay calls for a noncowardly lion to leap out of the forest what leaps is a lion not a vaudevillian in a lion outfit. And that talkative flying monkey is to all appearances a real monkey. The little guy has his moments but with only a voice to work with Braff seems hamstrung; the character ends up lacking the physicality and musicality Ray Bolger and Bert Lahr brought to their parts in the original. i Glinda (Michelle Williams) is a familiar magical presence in this color-saturated return to L. Frank Baums famous faraway land. Walt Disney Pictures hide caption toggle caption Walt Disney Pictures Glinda (Michelle Williams) is a familiar magical presence in this color-saturated return to L. Frank Baums famous faraway land. Walt Disney Pictures Ditto the witches -- there are three this time the other two played by Williams and Rachel Weisz -- and even James Franco. Hes pleasant enough as the man-who-would-be-Wizard but not someone youll miss when hes not on screen. Maybe thats the point -- that hes nothing without his magic tricks -- but a little pizzazz in the title role would still have been nice. Imagine the part played by Robert Downey Jr. who dropped out before filming started and youll get a sense of whats missing. And without wizardly flair this deliberately retro movie feels a lot more old-fashioned at least in one respect than was probably intended. You know how in most childrens fare boys get to have adventures and girls just get to get rescued? Well I hate to think what it says about progress on that front when unlike the 1939 Wizard of Oz in which everybody turned to Dorothy to fix things in Oz the Great and Powerful three strong women -- witches with magical powers no less -- get overcome by this entirely unimpressive guy. Maybe what it says is that chivalry (or perhaps feminism) of the sort that Judy Garland could count on is not only merely dead its really most sincerely dead.

""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is a lollapalooza of funhouse thrills and visually sumptuous filmmaking. The film opens with such a flourish and bang that some viewers may feel theyve been swept up in a tornado themselves. Respectful of the classic original film but never timid ""Oz"" represents the dizzy high point of Sam (""Spider-Man"") Raimis considerable career. He directs with skill and velocity tossing another unsuspecting Midwesterner into a whirlwind that leads to a dazzling land of munchkins and airborne monkeys. This time its not a brave farm girl in braids who makes the trip but Oscar Zoroaster Diggs (James Franco). Hes a traveling-circus magician of minor achievements scientific aspirations (his hero is Thomas Edison ""the wizard of Menlo Park"") and grand self-regard. The smugness that has soured some of Francos work suits a character who would rather be great than good. He makes a young svelte rather hot conjurer who has broken many a heart including that of Dorothy Gales mom-to-be (liquid-eyed Michelle Williams resplendent in a blonde wig). Francos strained smile hints at inner misgivings. Other Oz characters have wanted brains heart or nerve; Diggs needs a soul. Raimis keen sense of style serves the material well. The films black-and-white opening captures the drab threadbare world of Dust Bowl Kansas with claustrophobic boxed-in shots that could have been lifted from a 1930s B movie. When storm-tossed Diggs floats into Oz in his hot-air balloon the film image expands to widescreen proportions as lush lollipop hues gradually saturate the frame. The sets explode with color and detail as seamless and believable as a land of imagination can be. In Oz the happy hypocrite finds his niche a wonderland whose naive populace take him for their long-foretold savior. Hes quick to take advantage first of Mila Kunis playing a ravishing young witch who falls for his well-practiced come-ons. Her sister witch regal Rachel Weisz seems equally taken by the handsome newcomer. Kunis is traumatized the tracks of her tears furrowing into her cheeks as dainty scars. Williams reappears as the lands most purehearted witch gazing at the bumbling blowhard Diggs with knowing tolerant affection. The plot is a complicated skein of unrelated fairy-tale elements. We encounter Franklin a humble winged monkey; China Girl a cream-skinned porcelain doll with wistful bright blue eyes; and Knuck (""Bad Santas"" diminutive Tony Cox) a testy court herald. There is some metaphorical malarkey about building a family out of the defective materials youre given but its just so much filler. Merie Weismiller Wallace  Walt Disney Pictures via the New York Times Michelle Williams in ""Oz  The Great and Powerful."" The payoff is a whirligig climax in which Diggs fights the cackling fireball-throwing lightning-fingered forces of bad magic. He wins the day literally with smoke and mirrors. Raimi has great fun with the fake wizards command of theatrical illusion amid his lovingly rendered world of cinema magic. The special effects are appropriately out of this world. While theres really not a performer here who ranks with Judy Garland Ray Bolger or Bert Lahr theres plenty in this enormous production to charm the adults and wow the junior members. China Girl (voiced by Joey King) should sell a million dolls come holiday season and Franklin (voiced by Zach Braff) is so endearing that pet shops will be flooded with monkey requests. Unless my crystal ball fails me families will be off to see this wizard again and again.

I bring this up because James Franco who plays a younger version of the wizard in the overscaled underwhelming prequel Oz the Great and Powerful is also standing in a shadow. Robert Downey Jr. was the original choice. Would Downey have been a better pick for the charismatic con artist than the more introspective Franco? You be the judge.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> My feeling is that Franco does just fine - against daunting odds. The Wizard of Oz is a certified classic a generation-spanning favorite. Mess with it at your peril. And Francos Oz vehicle pimped out in 3D and every computer trick in New Hollywoods digital playbook is a mess indeed. Theres no Judy Garland songs no Scarecrow no Tin Man no Cowardly Lion. Theres also no simplicity no magic no truth. Amazingly it starts out like a winner. The mesmerizing prologue shot in black-and-white and presented on a boxy screen evokes the Kansas prairie of the first film. But instead of Dorothy on the farm singing ""Over the Rainbow"" we get circus magician Oscar Diggs (Franco) fooling audiences with cheap tricks and fleeing jealous husbands whose wives hes tricked into his bed. Director Sam Raimi of the Spider-Man trilogy works visual wonders as he eases into the story. As does Franco who shows us a man of his time (1905) a charlatan secretly obsessed with true-life wizards Harry Houdini and Thomas Edison. Its only when a tornado sweeps Oscar in a hot-air balloon into the Emerald City that the film bloats into a candy-colored widescreen extravaganza that leaves character at the mercy of fancy FX. Franco is basically playing the Dorothy role a stranger in a strange land. Rachel Weisz Mila Kunis and a luminous Michelle Williams portray the witches he meets along the way as he pretends to be the wizard the citizens of Oz crave. Its cute overload as he befriends a miniature china doll (voiced by Joey King) and a flying monkey (Zach Braff). In mining the novel by L. Frank Baum for fresh material screenwriters Mitchell Kapner (The Whole Nine Yards) and David Lindsay-Abaire (Rabbit Hole) miss the essential elements of charm and subversive wit. Instead this 3D exhibition of a movie takes its cue from Tim Burtons Alice in Wonderland and keeps throwing things at us relentlessly from the bared fangs of airborne baboons to a witch on a broomstick. Audiences may lap it up (the Oz-themed stage musical Wicked is a global smash). Near the end as limitless technology teaches the wizard about his own human limitations Franco hits grace notes that let us see glimmers of how great and powerful this uneven Oz might have been.

A small-time magician (James Franco) arrives in the enchanted land of Oz and is forced to decide if he will be a good man or a great one. Also starring Michelle Williams. (Photo/Video Disney) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated March 7 2013 640 p.m. ET With ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" Disney has produced two spectacles for the price of one. The less remarkable of the pair is the movie itself a relentlessly energetic effects-laden fantasy directed by Sam Raimi about the origins of the wizard in ""The Wizard of Oz."" Hes played by James Franco who finds some fun--though not a lot--in a pedestrian story that follows a potholed path through the enchantment-free zones of a 3-D theme park. (The finale features a fireworks display straight out of Disneyland.) The other spectacle which qualifies as truly astonishing is that of an entertainment behemoth betting vast sums of money on a film with a questionable concept a prequel that not only invites but demands comparison to a peerless treasure of American culture. The wizard of the new production is like the character played by Frank Morgan in the 1939 film a wily faker. (He calls himself Oz though his real name is Oscar.) Whats more this two-bit carnival magician is a casual liar and cheerful womanizer who knows he isnt a good man but aspires to be a great man ""I want to be Harry Houdini and Thomas Edison all rolled into one."" Oz functions as the Dorothy of the piece because this is a pre-Dorothy prequel. Its his journey via hot-air balloon and a black-and-white tornado to the colorful land of Oz where a series of adventures will make him a better man in a process of self-realization that has become for the Disney brand a serial preachment and corporate obsession. The journey never lacks for scenery--Oz hurtling down a river in the balloons basket or plunging Cinerama-style over a waterfall; flowers opening up in luscious colors; a blizzard of butterflies in a kind of candified ""Avatar"" landscape. Soon the hero encounters Theodora the first of this movies three witches which is one witch more than before. She is played by Mila Kunis bewitchingly scenic in a red-and-black outfit with a swoop-brimmed red hat. (The stunning costumes were designed by Gary Jones and Michael Kutsche.) When this witch speaks however shes shopping-mall banal and Ms. Kuniss inexplicably flat performance doesnt improve but only turns shrill when the naive Theodora having mistaken Oz for a king turns into the Wicked Witch of the West. ENLARGE The wizards balloon traverses the landscape in Oz the Great and Powerful. Walt Disney Pictures Read Related More Action Less Drama at Disney The witchery takes some explaining. Theodora isnt the only divided soul in her family. Her older sister Evanora could be mistaken for a good witch or at least a smart and skeptical one but she too is a moral chameleon. Fortunately Evanora is played by Rachel Weisz who sustains if only for a short while a welcome spirit of droll sophistication. And happily for the notion of good versus evil (a distinction thats blurred by narrative clutter) the good witch Glinda is played by Michelle Williams who gives nice a really good name. Elegantly gowned in white and gold Ms. Williams looks beautiful to be sure--Glindas features radiate the warmth of a 1940s pinup--but even better she looks like shes enjoying herself in a film that sells enjoyment as an industrial commodity. This brings us back to Mr. Franco who must sell the questionably compelling central character--will global audiences really care about this guy?--on the basis of a zest-impaired script which was written by Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire. That he succeeds as well as he does is notable and hes genuinely charming at a few stops along the way. One of them a rare instance when the writing rises above competent carpentry involves a little china doll with broken legs. (Computer-generated shes voiced beguilingly by Joey King.) Once Oz glues her together and gets her up and walking again she becomes his road buddy along with Finley a cute CGI flying monkey voiced by Zach Braff. But what does it say about ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" that China Doll a creature born of digital code is the movies most affecting character? That brings us back to unavoidable comparisons. Disney clearly knew from the start that developing its ""Oz"" would be tricky since the rights to the old Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film are now owned by Warner Bros. To guide its elaborate twist on a classic story the studio hired Mr. Raimi who had directed the ""Spider-Man"" movies. Then Disney hitched its wagon to the star of special effects. (No disrespect meant to Mr. Franco who took the starring role after Robert Downey Jr. and Johnny Depp had reportedly turned it down.) ENLARGE Mila Kunis and James Franco Walt Disney Pictures The effects prove to be surprisingly variable by turns lovely and expansive (Oz and Theodora racing across a natural stone bridge as it crumbles); pretty (Glinda commuting inside her soap bubble); perfunctory (cue the sharp-toothed river fairies); cheesy (a long shot of Emerald City suggests soaring plaster perhaps in homage to a more innocent time); oppressively familiar (a battle of levitating witches) or dark and scary (flying baboons subbing for the earlier Wicked Witchs winged monkeys). Taken together all these prodigies of cinema technology may or may not make Disneys bet a winning one. Still its instructive to reflect on whats missing in ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" by recalling what made ""The Wizard of Oz"" one of the most beloved movies of all time. Judy Garland yes of course; was there ever a more stirring performance? And Ray Bolger Bert Lahr and Jack Haley and on and on. But no lessons can be learned from nostalgia for long-dead stars and superb vaudevillians or from turning their inimitable film into a shrine; tastes change popular culture transforms itself. What ""Oz"" might well have borrowed from its predecessor however is what allowed Garland and her colleagues to be great--a sense of drama that still resonates with contemporary audiences. Remember what happens even before ""The Wizard of Oz"" gets to the tornado? Dorothy sings a sublime song ""Over the Rainbow"" then loses her precious Toto then recovers him. The relevant lessons arent in the cuteness of the pooch or the matchless song or even the use of music (although Disneys ""Oz"" does use one dismally unmusical ditty). Theyre in the urgency of yearning and despair that the song and Totos loss convey. In contrast to the present hero a scalawag bent on improving himself Garlands heroine wants what everyone wants--to be loved to feel safe to find her hearts desire. And she wants it with perfect emotional clarity Its still devastating when Dorothy who has lost her way cries ""Im frightened Auntie Em Im frightened"" The lessons of Dorothys traveling companions remain relevant too. The Scarecrow wants to understand the world around him the Cowardly Lion wants the courage to live his life and the Tin Man wants to fill the empty can that serves as his chest. ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" like so many products of movie studios that have lost their way is a Tin Man of epic proportions--bright and shiny with no heart.

"Oz the Great and Powerful gets over the rainbow review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesOz the Great and Powerful gets over the rainbow reviewIt is both strength and weakness of Oz the Great and Powerful that it doesnt monkey too much with Oz mythology.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. March 7 2013Oz the Great and PowerfulStarring James Franco Michelle Williams Mila Kunis Zach Braff and Rachel Weisz. Directed by Sam Raimi. 131 minutes. Opens March 8 at major theatres. PGPay some attention to that man behind the curtainSo proclaims Oz the Great and Powerful Sam Raimis curious prequel to The Wizard of Oz where the focus shifts from Dorothys sweet perambulations to the wizards sneaky prestidigitations.Article Continued BelowDid Raimi and his wily wizard played by James Franco apply to join the Impossible Missions Force before accepting this assignment? Here you have two determined ironists tackling a fable of utter sincerity one that resides not just over the rainbow but in the childhood memories of multitudes young and old. Failure isnt just an option but almost a certainty.The yellow brick road is littered not just with potholes (as we alarmingly learn in Oz the Great and Powerful) but also the broken bones of previous attempts to reconjure the magic of Victor Flemings 1939 classic film and the source Oz novels by L. Frank Baum.But where other return trips to the Emerald City failed (Return to Oz and The Wiz come to mind) this one makes a relatively safe landing -- perhaps too safe for fans of Raimis Evil Dead and Spider-Man franchises which played with genre expectations. It is both strength and weakness of Oz the Great and Powerful that it is a true prequel one that isnt inclined to monkey too much with Oz mythology or the 1939 movie that everybody has seen. Raimi and screenwriters Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire construct their story with monochrome-to-colour transitions and Kansas-to-Oz character links that follow the familiar template.You could easily see this playing as part of a double bill with The Wizard of Oz even if the effects in Raimis film often look cheesier than the ones in its 74-year-old predecessor. A combo visual aesthetic of Disney Dr. Seuss and bad LSD trip assaults the eyeballs once Francos circus balloon arrives in the Land of Oz via the tornado that passes for public transit in these parts. (3D is available but definitely not needed.)But first we meet his Oscar Diggs in the silver-hued Kansas of 1905 where he and his faithful assistant/whipping boy Frank (Zach Braff) are busily separating suckers from their money via tricks inspired by Oscars two heroes Houdini and Thomas Edison.When hes not conjuring Oscar keeps busy breaking the hearts and/or spirits of the women and girls who desire his attention including a wheelchair-bound lass who really is in need of some magic.Just ahead of a beating for his many indiscretions is a trusty Kansas windstorm which whisks Oscar away to you-know-where. When he lands sadly not upon a wicked witch hes met by the wide-eyed Theodora (Mila Kunis) who assumes he must be a wizard one who local lore insists will vanquish an evil witch that is terrorizing the residents of Oz. (The witch must really be a downer because these Ozniks dont start singing until the 90-minute mark and then only for a few moments.)Theodora also takes a shine to Oscar and anyone who has seen Wicked might have a clue as to where this is heading especially when Rachel Weisz shows up as Theodoras sister and potential rival Evanora.And just as with The Wizard of Oz there are other travelers on the yellow brick road. Oscar falls in with a flying monkey named Finley (voiced by Braff) a comely mystery belle named Glinda (Michelle Williams) and a shattered girl made of china (Joey King) who is actually the films best CGI creation.Oscar helps make China Girl whole using some old-fashioned glue but hes not quite sure as to what hes going to do when he confronts the big bad witch who waits for him in the enslaved Emerald City.All he has to work with apart from his travelling companions are an army of farmers tinkers and Munchkins who dont exactly look battle-ready. No wonder the sign to the Dark Forest looks as if it really reads ""Dork Forest.""""If it were easy would we need a wizard?"" Glinda tells him.Many of the exchanges in this overlong movie involve Oscar normally great at self-promoting flannel insisting hes not really all that great and powerful. The answer he gets back is a variation of ""You gotta believe"" This happens so often it could make Tinker Bell slap her head in frustration.But a funny thing happens on the yellow road to the green city. The movie actually gets stronger towards the end finally kicking into creative high gear as Oscar figures out how to use his talent for scams to do some good.The finale is good enough to almost make you forget the one thing that Ive been avoiding mentioning so far which is that Franco wasnt the best choice to play the wizard. His default expression is smirking hes not great at playing with CGI creations and as he demonstrated all too well in his botched attempt as Oscar show host hes not big on sincerity. All those speeches about believing in yourself dont slide off his lips. Franco might have been the right guy for the job had Raimi decided to send up the Oz myth. But that likely wouldnt have gone down well with their Disney masters who reportedly spent 200 million on this film and who evidently have franchise hopes for Baums 14-volume Oz saga.And when it comes down to matters of money -- well Dorothy we just arent in Kansas anymore.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Sam Raimis gazillion-dollar prequel to ""The Wizard of Oz"" features gorgeous production design - liberally quoting and pilfering from the beloved 1939 original - dazzling costumes (many of them draped on Rachel Weisz) and explosive imaginative special effects. You can feel its good intentions even when Michelle Williams isnt on screen glowing with the ethereal saintly blondness of Glinda the Good Witch. Raimi and his collaborators have made an honest effort to capture the family-movie spirit of old Hollywood while updating the action and humor to more contemporary standards.But saying that Raimis trip to Oz is adequate eye candy with a good heart isnt the same thing as saying its actually good. I was charmed at some moments profoundly bored by others and almost never felt genuinely excited or emotionally engaged. A lumbering bloated spectacle with a weak script and a flat awkward central performance by James Franco ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" feels like a hybrid of ""Avatar"" and ""John Carter"" meaning that its increasingly unclear what the point of the movie is except to look great and make money. If its nostalgic for something it doesnt really know what or why The production values of 1939? The dire social and economic context of 1939? The unsophisticated and supposedly innocent fantasy universe of L. Frank Baum?If the commercial fortunes of ""Oz"" lie somewhere in between ""Avatar"" and ""John Carter"" and probably a bit closer to the former - everyone at Disney and most people in Hollywood are hoping this is the years first big hit - that reflects the tide of positive hype and an unbeatable level of ""pre-awareness"" and audience goodwill. (Hardly anyone outside a modest core of sci-fi readers had heard of John Carter; nobody hasnt heard of the Wizard of Oz.) But the things I remember about this movie the morning after seeing it are all about its references to that other movie. The whole audience went ""Oh"" when we saw the note-perfect painted backdrop for the Emerald City and its impossible not to smile at the precise recreation of the cornfield the Yellow Brick Road and the split-rail fence where Dorothy the Scarecrow and the Tin Man will dance sometime in the future of Oz. As for what actually happens along that road in ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" thats not half as memorable.Those of us who loved the ""Evil Dead"" movies keep hoping that the fierce kinetic freewheeling madness of Raimis early career will show up in his studio pictures but the truth is weve been seduced and abandoned like the Kansas country girl left behind by Francos huckster and carnival magician when he makes his balloon getaway. Each of Raimis ""Spider-Man"" movies has moments of terrific action cinema but over the course of that trilogy he turned into a contemporary version of Cecil B. DeMille a cynical populist with a trademark style whose only storytelling task is to get us from one special-effects showcase to the next. Thats as good a way of explaining whats right and wrong with ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" as any.There are a handful of simultaneously delightful and frustrating scenes of pure Raimi insanity here like distorted shots of Franco and his traveling companions from the point of view of carnivorous flowers in the Dark Forest. And lets give Raimi credit for actually using the 3-D format to deliver a significant number of sight gags that should leave kids in the audience shrieking and ducking. This isnt the murky light-stealing 3-D of so many other recent films and it might actually be worth the extra few bucks. So its not like theres zero fun factor here by a long shot - but the fun comes yoked to a long-winded and predictable story with lots of dead spots. You Might Also Like We begin of course in black-and-white (and in a nearly square aspect ratio a nice touch). Roguish traveling magician Oscar known as Oz (Franco) has broken a few too many local girls hearts and needs to beat a hasty retreat from his carnivals Kansas encampment. The one he actually likes Annie (Williams) is about to give up waiting for him and marry a local farm boy and Oz makes it clear hes not ready to give up his dreams of Harry Houdini cum Thomas Edison glory and settle down. So he flies his balloon through an impressive CGI tornado into the wide-screen full-color Candyland of Oz in an extended effects sequence that has both the thrill value and the narrative momentum of an amusement-park ride and that may be more fun than anything that follows.Im not a Franco-basher in general; I think hes a fine actor in the right context however overexposed he is as a hipster-flavored celebrity and Renaissance man. I can tell he made all sorts of acting-school decisions about this character but I dont think we needed his introspective discount-Brando act when it came to playing the Wizard of freakin Oz. Francos not exactly terrible its just that he comes off as insincere and indecisive in a role that demands ebullient showmanship and shameless sentimentality in roughly equal measure. His character seems about to drift off in some other direction - shifty-eyed mob hitman? Norse trickster god? - at any moment and never feels even remotely related to Frank Morgans wizard in the 1939 movie.Anyway when Oz gets to Oz hes received as the savior wizard long foretold by prophecy partly because of his name and partly because a semi-good but profoundly naive witch called Theodora (Mila Kunis) flips for him immediately and announces that shed love to be his queen and co-ruler. Women Kunis seems even more out of her depth than Franco here largely because Theodora is more like a construct than a character first dense and then profoundly evil. (Oops Wasnt supposed to tell you that was I?) Shes being bossed around by her sister Evanora (Weisz) who boasts fabulous gowns and a haughty English accent and has exiled their super-obviously-not-evil third sister Glinda (Williams) into the deep dark forest. I like all three of those actresses but their roles are essentially static forces between whom Francos Oz bounces like a smirking pinball. Weisz at least chews up the scenery with abandon and looks sensational framed against the Emerald City sets.

Photo Credit AP Photo advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A carnival magician travels to a magical land where hes welcomed as a real wizard. Rated PG (some scary imagery) BOTTOM LINE Forget comparisons to the 1939 classic and you might enjoy this fun fluffy fantasy. CAST James Franco Mila Kunis Michelle Williams Rachel Weisz LENGTH 207 Were you really expecting ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" starring James Franco to live up to ""The Wizard of Oz"" starring Judy Garland? If so youre the one living in a fantasy land. In reality the best we could hope for is exactly what we got a reasonably smart imaginative spin on the 1939 MGM classic. By now the world created by novelist L. Frank Baum more than a century ago feels like a myth without an origin and ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" wisely avoids slavish loyalty to any canon. Instead it tries to fashion a fresh story from old material. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Our new hero Oscar Diggs (James Franco) is a womanizing carnival magician whisked by a twister from a monochrome Kansas into a rainbow-hued Oz. Fortuitously mistaken for a legendary wizard come to reign over a kingdom full of gold Oscar finds that life aint nothing but witches and money He seduces Theodora (a terrific Mila Kunis) makes a play for chilly Evanora (Rachel Weisz) and ultimately falls for Glinda (Michelle Williams). Can you guess which witch will turn green with jealousy? ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" brims with ideas (playwright David Lindsay-Abaire is a co-writer) though theyre a mixed bag. Oscars computer-animated friends pale next to Dorothys vivacious companions but Finley the flying monkey (voiced by Zach Braff) has his moments and the chipped little China Girl (Joey King) is quite touching. Franco overdoes the fakery -- he seems to be conning us too -- but Williams transforms the bubbly Glinda into a smart sexy sophisticated figure. ""If you can make them believe"" she tells the magician ""then youre wizard enough."" Ditto for this movie. Zippily directed by Sam Raimi (""Spider-Man"") with good humor and an eye for detail ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" may not have real magic but it comes close. 150 VideoTrailer Oz the Great and Powerful PLOT A carnival magician travels to a magical land where hes welcomed as a real wizard. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG (some scary imagery) CAST James Franco Mila Kunis Michelle Williams Rachel Weisz LENGTH 207 BOTTOM LINE Forget comparisons to the 1939 classic and you might enjoy this fun fluffy fantasy. Great and powerful Sam Raimi connections Any Sam Raimi fan knows the ""Evil Dead"" auteur likes to slip in cameo appearances for his actor brother Ted and his cult-star pal Bruce Campbell. They both pop up in ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" as respectively a small-town skeptic at a magic show who yells ""I see a wire"" in the black-and-white opening sequence and a Winkie guard at the gates of the Emerald City. But there are less Oz-tentatious cameos as well. Theres Jim Moll -- Raimis former theater teacher at Birmingham Groves High School in suburban Detroit near where ""Oz"" was filmed. Now interim principal at the nearby Royal Oak High School the mustachioed Moll plays Townsperson No. 10. ""Oh my God yes"" Raimi confirms when asked. ""A lot of my high-school teachers who had a great influence over me and junior high-school teachers are playing in the crowd scenes.""

"Movie review Oz the Great and Powerful - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate Oz the Great and Powerful never finds its groove Share Tweet This is a test player. Share Tweet By Ty Burr Globe Staff | 03.07.13 | 220 PM Its worth reflecting for a moment on what makes 1939s ""The Wizard of Oz"" not just a great movie but an iconic experience and pop touchstone. It got mixed reviews in 1939 but my generation discovered the film on TV after family gatherings when the grown-ups were sleeping off the tryptophan and it has since rolled out across VHS and DVD as a childhood rite of passage. There are those catchy songs of course and a villainess that perches on the edge of nightmare. The winged monkeys go over that edge -- theyre Hieronymus Bosch for kiddies. But its Dorothy who makes ""Wizard"" stick or rather the profound emotional yearning for a home beyond the rainbow conveyed by the young Judy Garland who herself had lost her bearings in the Oz of MGM. ""The Wizard of Oz"" works because we can feel it. Which is precisely whats missing from ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" that sense of emotional journey. The new film comes at us with all the 21st-century bells and whistles -- computer-generated effects 3-D visuals -- and the absurdly talented Sam Raimi (the ""Evil Dead"" and ""Spider-Man"" trilogies) behind the camera. An unofficial prequel to ""The Wizard of Oz"" it has a sly but gracious reverence for the fantasy world created by L. Frank Baum and it gets as close to the 1939 movie as lawyers for current copyright holder Warner Bros. will allow. Even the colors glow with the hyperreal tones of classic three-strip Technicolor. Related Links Find showtimes and theaters Find showtimes and theaters in 3D Find showtimes and theaters in IMAX 3D But alas James Franco has been cast in the lead role of Oscar Diggs the tent-show magician from Kansas who becomes -- not at all convincingly until the very end -- the wonderful Wizard of Oz. Franco is frankly too callow too feckless too much the dude for this role. Johnny Depp was a rumored lead at one point but that would have brought the movie even closer than it already is to Tim Burtons 2010 ""Alice in Wonderland"" an eye-popping CGI bore. Robert Downey Jr. was another candidate and that might have been better -- he might have anchored the role in both wit and hurt. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below But Francos Oz is required to be a jerk for most of the films 130 minutes and it wears you out. There are still some wonderful things in ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" and one of them is the opening section set in 1905 Kansas -- a classic black-and-white 43-aspect-ratio Kansas much like the beginning of the 1939 movie. Once the tornado whisks the hero by balloon to Oz the colors bleed in and the screen magically widens but the landscapes have the craggy familiar ""awesomeness"" of every other computer-generated fantasy film these days. Weve been here before and too recently. Another problem Mila Kunis is all wrong as Theodora initially the most naive of the three witches of Oz. The actress is terrific in modern-dress roles but theres nothing mythic or otherworldly about her a fact that becomes plain as soon as Rachel Weisz turns up as her scheming sister Evanora. Imperious larger-than-life -- now this is a witch. (For those keeping score the new movie has nothing to do with the ""Wicked"" franchise of book and stage.) The movies third witch the super-nice one is named Glinda (but you knew that already) and is played by Michelle Williams with a dreamy sweetness that doesnt convey the depths of which this actress is capable. The story lines a little confusing -- Oscar is welcomed as the prophesied Wizard who will rescue the kingdom from evil but first he has to figure out which witch is which and his many interactions with Glinda Theodora Evanora et al. are surprisingly charmless and flat. Raimi has trouble finding the right rhythm or the proper energy and he isnt helped by a script by Mitchell Kapner and the gifted playwright David Lindsay-Abaire (""Rabbit Hole"") that hovers around the ""Shrek 2"" level of invention. There are a few moments though when you see what might have been -- how ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" could have resonated with the storybook strangeness of ""The Wizard of Oz."" The scene in which the hero meets China Girl a living porcelain doll voiced by actress Joey King is tender and sad and altogether marvelous; the movie subsequently hops to life whenever shes onscreen. Oscar gets a comic sidekick in Finley an amusingly servile winged monkey in a bellhop uniform and Zach Braff briefly seen in the Kansas opening gives the characters lines welcome topspin. Elsewhere you sense Raimis own wings have been clipped. The Munchkins look like what they are -- extras at a costume party. Evadoras henchmen are no monkeys this time out but vicious flying baboons fearsome creatures we barely get a look at so intent is Disney on keeping the film safely in PG territory. The director doubtless appreciates how close the 1939 film gets to the dark and hes a good person to take us there but the corporate hands that have fashioned ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" are too nervous to let him. So the movie toggles between inspiration and calculation never finding its groove. The ""Oz"" stories are fantasies but homespun and uniquely American; they connect with us through Baums cracker-barrel imagination or Judy Garlands boundless ache. Theres little to bond with in this one certainly not its grinning lightweight of a lead actor. Even the Wicked Witch of the West when shes finally revealed in all her green-skinned glory has the smooth computerized features of a video game villain. Very late in the going Francos cowardly Oscar does become the great and powerful Oz in a rip-roaring climax thats an ingenious fusion of Baum steampunk Thomas Alva Edison and early movie technology. At long last the movie puts on a show both in the traveling-circus sense and in terms of our modern multiplex expectations. Raimi gets to have a little fun and so do we. But its at that point you realize the people whove made ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" are more interested in building a new machine than in taking us over the rainbow and bringing us back home.

Comments click to enlarge Oz the Great and Powerful Video Rated PG  130 minutes  2013 Sam Raimi brings the jokey adolescent sensibility of his Drag Me to Hell to this lavish Wizard of Oz prequel and the result is as unshapely as that premise would suggest. The special effects are imaginative and the script (cowritten by Pulitzer Prize-winning dramatist David Lindsay-Abaire) has some nice sentiments about the power of illusion. But Raimi seems unwilling (or perhaps unable) to take any of it seriously racing through scenes that ought to inspire wonder or playing the material for cheap sarcastic laughs. Hes found an ideal leading man in James Franco whose smug incredulous line readings suggest he took the role as inside joke. With Michelle Williams Rachel Weisz and Mila Kunis.

Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday March 7 2013 102 PM Title Oz the Great and Powerful Film Info PG Violence scary images. Area theaters. There is no reason artists cant revisit or even revise the most beloved of iconic works. Both the literary and theatrical versions of ""Wicked"" for example expanded on L. Frank Baums original witches of Oz in a creative and clever fashion that has connected with countless devoted fans. And now comes Sam Raimis attempt to do the same. If it only had a brain. Or a heart. Or nerve. Come to think of it Raimi does have some nerve trampling all over Baums ideals of self-reliance and social equality -- radical concepts in 1900 and apparently still so today. Though Dorothy remains the most famous Baums extraordinary series gave us many of the greatest heroines in childrens literature. (Disney could learn a thing or two from his powerful Princess Ozma.) In contrast Raimi and his screenwriters Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire undermine every one of their female leads. Baum -- and director Victor Fleming who introduced generations of viewers to Oz with his classic 1939 film -- used the Wizard to warn us away from empty idols and foolish hero worship. Raimi enthusiastically embraces both of these notions. His version is a prequel to ""The Wizard of Oz"" in which a shallow selfish magician named Oscar (James Franco) travels from Kansas to the Emerald City where he is stunned to find himself greeted as a savior. Michelle Williams is the good witch Glinda in Oz the Great and Powerful. Oz is a land largely run by women but unlike the ones in Baums books (or Flemings movie) these ladies are wide-eyed weaklings desperately waiting for the Wizard to solve all their problems. The Wicked Witch of the West (Mila Kunis) is a love-crazy airhead defined entirely by her relationship with Oscar. One can only imagine what Margaret Hamilton who created such an unforgettable villain in the first film would think of this comedown. Though also a commanding witch her sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz) is helpless in the face of Oscars tricks. Even Glinda (Michelle Williams) spends more time boosting Oscars ego than trying to save her own people. As for the cluttered ultra-expensive 3D visuals they are designed to recall the 1939 original. And they do. But mostly in the sense that they will make you nostalgic for actual cinematic magic. The timeless cultural touchstones we all recognize -- a poppy field a gingham dress the Yellow Brick Road -- feel trotted out as soulless representations of commerce a way to exploit our memories. Its baffling that Raimi who so deftly revived ""Spider-Man"" has flattened his potentially thrilling family film with such a cynical approach. Where Flemings version joyfully and imaginatively embraced new technology this one wastes money (a reported 200 million) on computer-generated effects that feel less delightful than artificial and ostentatious. James Francos Oscar is greeted as a savior by the residents of the Emerald City. (Merie Weismiller Wallace SMPSP) The most noteworthy scene is a symphony of flowers that must have cost a fortune; Disneys hand-drawn ""Alice in Wonderland"" did the same thing in far more charming fashion back in 1951. Under the circumstances its no wonder the cast is unable to lift this lead balloon of a movie. Francos slick self-awareness -- which is reaching its expiration date -- does perfectly represent the films superficial tone. (The less said about Zach Braff as a monkey sidekick the better.) But its depressing to watch three excellent actresses diminished so thoroughly. There are innumerable disappointments in Raimis return to a land we all love. But the most outrageous is the brazen claim that its based on Baums open-hearted books. Dont be fooled by the smoke and mirrors. There is nothing here that is great or powerful. Worst of all theres nothing here that even feels like Oz. Magic moment Oscar is inspired by another wizard -- Thomas Edison. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Oz the Great and Powerful (PG) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Oz the Great and Powerful (PG) Sam Raimis take on the world of Oz is a dazzling hollow fantasy. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com3/7/2013 Editor rating 1 Oz the Great and Powerful is an oppressive bloated bore the latest argument that CGI kills the imaginations of talented filmmakers. George Lucas fell prey to it with the Star Wars prequels. Tim Burtons best movie remains 1994s Ed Wood which was ironically about a filmmaker who made cheap lo-fi movies. Michael Bays pictures keep getting worse. James Cameron has become so obsessed with the technology that hes apparently going to spend the rest of his career making Avatar sequels. Steven Spielberg was seduced with Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull but he learned his lesson quickly (most of War Horse which would have been easier to make using special effects was shot largely without CGI). And now sadly Sam Raimi has succumbed to the temptation of directing a movie that was made primarily on computers. A prequel (and sort of a remake) to the perennial 1939 classic The Wizard of Oz the new film reveals how Oscar (James Franco) a carnival magician and huckster from 1905 Kansas wound up as the all-powerful wizard of a magical realm. Raimi pays homage to the original by shooting the first 20 minutes in black and white and a square (133 Academy ratio) frame. The opening raises your hopes because it was shot on beautifully-designed practical sets that feel tactile and lived-in. But then Oscar makes a hasty exit on a hot air balloon is whisked away by a tornado to a faraway land and the film turns into blazing color and a widescreen ratio and the life begins to seep out of the movie. There are parts of Oz the Great and Powerful that seem to have been included for an intended ride at a Disney park such as a vertigo-inducing plunge over a waterfall. Other elements in the film were obviously conceived to sell toys such as a winged monkey who becomes Oscars servant or a living porcelain doll who is an orphan and takes to Oscar like a father. Franco fares badly when hes forced to hold conversations with characters who arent really there He looks as bored and distracted as he did when he hosted the Oscars and he relies too much on a wide grin that makes him look manic instead of charming (imagine what Robert Downey Jr. could have done with this role). Things dont get any better when Oscar meets actual people either. Mila Kunis (as a gentle witch) Rachel Weisz (as her conniving sister) and Michelle Williams (as Glinda the Good Witch) are all talented actresses but they come off as disengaged as Franco because most of the film was shot on green screen and the leading man doesnt isnt give them much to work with (Williams who plays Glinda as a passive soft-spoken willow of a woman fares particularly badly). Visually Oz the Great and Powerful is stunning (especially in 3D). The Emerald City looks like Gotham lit in green neon the villainous flying baboons are appropriately scary and a shot in which the red leaves on a tree suddenly fly away as butterflies is lovely. But Raimi gets so wrapped up in the look and design of the movie that he forgets about pacing and plot. The story lumbers along spending way too much time admiring its own creations and at 130 minutes your eyes start to hurt and the film starts to feel endless. Children will undoubtedly love Oz the Great and Powerful The movie is aimed squarely at the kiddie set with some hip actors thrown in to hopefully draw in teenagers too. But unlike the original this movie will not endure. It will be as quickly forgotten as Burtons Alice in Wonderland which was a massive hit worldwide but left no cultural imprint. The saddest part about the films failure is that Raimi made his first movie 1981s The Evil Dead with practically no money using ingenuity and resourcefulness to create a horror classic that spawned two sequels (and has now been remade). Even his Spider-Man trilogy although heavy on special effects always kept the characters at the forefront. In Oz the Great and Powerful which cost a reported 200 million Raimi forgets everything that made his best movies work (A Simple Plan Drag Me to Hell The Gift Army of Darkness) and has made a lifeless cartoon thats all flash no heart.

Hes an expert at smoke-and-mirrors misdirection as well as a practiced lothario (he seduces his tenuous objects of affection with a tchotchke music box and a devilish grin). But Oscar nonetheless longs for something more--for the ""greatness"" he sees in people like Thomas Edison whose inventions (from the incandescent lightbulb to the Kinetoscope) have given mankind a literally illuminative sense of faith. Its an earnest hope to be sure and the greatest strength of Sam Raimis imaginative if highly uneven take on L. Frank Baums series of childrens stories about that magical land over the rainbow is its unabashed sincerity. Right from the opening credits--designed to resemble handheld stage props popping out from behind a seemingly infinite series of prosceniums--its clear the Spider-Man helmers heart is fully in this big-budget 3-D project. The feeling persists through the leisurely paced Kansas scenes (gorgeously photographed to mimic the Academy-ratio sepia tones of the 1939 Judy Garland perennial) which do a lovely job of introducing all the real-world characters that have a metaphorical Ozite counterpart. Then the inevitable tornado hits whisking Oscar away to the widescreen Technicolor world he is prophesied to rule and the movies rock-solid footing starts to wobble. Most of the problems stem from the casting Franco is a distinctly uninspiring Oz which works for the early scenes but is near disastrous when he assumes his predestined roles of liberator savior and big giant head. The actors two default modes--stoned indifference and performance-art aloofness--do not an invigorating leader make. Equally off-key is Mila Kunis as the glamorous enchantress Theodora who turns into one of the Oz seriess most memorable antagonists after Oscar breaks her heart. (Lets just say Margaret Hamilton would not be green with envy at this screechily anemic pretender to her wicked throne.) And while Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams do their best catty-sister act as Theodoras siblings--the evil witch Evanora and the good witch Glinda--they are ultimately no more than action-figure props made to engage in by-the-numbers showdowns better suited to a Star Wars prequel. That Raimi manages to make something of Oz the Great and Powerful despite all these and other obstacles inherent to a Disney-financed superproduction is close to a miracle. A good part of that has to do with the Rorschach-blot power of Baums creation Like Oscar or the seriess other constant protagonist Dorothy Gale whose family is briefly referenced here the land of Oz morphs to fit the mind-set of the outsiders inhabiting it--character and creator alike. Though the filmmaker is clearly hindered by the overall narrative arc (one of those origin-story prequels for which modern movie junkies have a peculiarly ravenous taste) his distinctive mark is evident in most of the other details. Dark forest inhabitants leap out at our heroes like Evil Dead beasties and Raimis playful wit is evident in everything from a sharp-toothed river fairy with a penchant for spit-takes to a ragged yellow brick road directional sign that points to ""China Town"" (a town made of...china). And its genuinely moving the way that he uses Oscars Edison hero worship to smuggle in a power-of-movies leitmotif very much reminiscent of Martin Scorseses Hugo. Though Oz has some of the same narrative issues and effects-heavy bloat as that highly personal fantasy film every frame is infused with a deep-rooted impassioned understanding of the cinemas magical power to captivate and inspire. Its nearly enough to counterbalance the movies many deficiencies; if only more similarly flawed pictures had this level of brains heart and nerve.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Its likely that director Sam Raimi sees some of himself in ""Oz"" the circus-magician-turned-prophesized-savior in the Disney fantasy Oz The Great And Powerful Hes a great conjuror of illusion asked to marshal forces beyond comprehension but hes an outsider too a mischievous little rascal whos used to doing things his own way. Theres some overlap between Raimis irreverent sensibility and the large-scale fractured fairytale his Hollywood betters seem to want but theres tension too and the persistent clank of an overly tinkered machine. Oz The Great And Powerful tries to be many things at once A PG-rated Army Of Darkness with a modern jester whisked off to another world for a fantasy adventure; an immersive 3-D wonderment along the lines of Alice In Wonderland or Hugo; a prequel to L. Frank Baums The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz that has Shreks winking attitude while paying faithful homage to the marvels and mythology of The Wizard Of Oz perhaps the greatest of all Hollywood spectacles. It cant possibly do it all. Much of Oz The Great And Powerfuls fate is tied to James Francos performance as Oz and the center barely holds with Franco often looking as overwhelmed by the task as he was by his hosting job on Oscar night. After he narrowly escapes angry Kansans in a hot-air balloon a tornado whisks him away to the magical land of Oz where the helpful witch Theodora (Mila Kunis) informs him of a prophecy that has a ""wizard"" named Oz arriving to claim the throne of the slain king. The only catch In order to become king and enjoy the wealth and accommodations of the Emerald City he must first defeat the wicked witch. The fact that he isnt an actual wizard signals disaster but he gets support from the good witch Glinda (Michelle Williams) a porcelain doll (voiced by Joey King) and the flying monkey (voiced by Zach Braff) who becomes his faithful assistant. Oz The Great And Powerful gets off to a rough start with a strained black-and-white prologue that invites an unflattering comparison to The Wizard Of Oz and an onslaught of digital effects that turn Oz into more of a gaming landscape than a real place. When most of the fun comes from Braffs vaudevillian wisecracks as the monkey its clear there isnt nearly enough fun happening elsewhere. The film settles into a better groove once Oz stops fussing about being an imposter and joins Glinda in bringing the peace-loving people of Emerald City together for an elaborate reasonably satisfying plan of attack. Throughout Oz The Great And Powerful Raimi does what he can to squeeze in some clever references or Looney Tunes-style comic whizbangery but the film gets away from him. On a production this gargantuan he cant be the only man behind the curtain.

Chicago Tribune movie critic Michael Phillips and Redbox movie critic Erika Olson talk about the new movie ""Oz The Great and Powerful."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune In show business like all business very often you spend money to make money. Director Sam Raimis ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is Disneys latest attempt to spend 200 million to make a billion worldwide on the order of Tim Burtons ""Alice in Wonderland."" Shot in 3-D on soundstages in Pontiac Mich. the movie carries a heavy load of expectation-based freight and stockholder-oriented imperatives enough to make it pretty hard on Raimi and company to achieve anything truly wondrous. With some industrial products you must settle for agreeable.This is an uneven but agreeably managed blockbuster better than the last one (""Jack the Giant Slayer"") aiming for the same demographic. Raimis just enough of an oddball franchise-friendly (from his three ""Spider-Man"" pictures) yet happy to return to the well of exploitation grunge now and then (""Drag Me to Hell"") to sneak in some strangeness as well as some verifiable filmmaking. Mostly its visual touches punctuation such as the way Raimi angles the camera this way and that to denote extreme danger. Or the way hell zwoop in or out with a zoom shot on Rachel Weisz stopping short of where you think it will. Also hes a sucker for sweetness as in Raimis obvious fondness for the kindly winged (animated) monkey in the bellboys uniform voiced by Zach Braff.The movies weaknesses and strengths are captured by James Franco as the carny magician who departs 1905 Kansas to play that great Orpheum circuit in the sky otherwise known as the Land of Oz reachable only by tornado. Franco who can be great fun on screen is capable of many things. Rhetorical flourish and theatrical brio arent two of them. When asked to bamboozle the gullible customers on Earth or in Oz (""It was nothing just a little prestidigitation-ist display"") you worry that he wont make it through some of his lines alive. And yet he seems to be having a ball up there. Attitude counts when youre in the middle of a really big movie with lots of fireballs and green electricity zapping out of a witchs fingers. Is ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" a prequel to the Oz we know best from the movies ""The Wizard of Oz"" or a separate adventure culled from the L. Frank Baum books or what? Yes to all three. In a nod to the 1939 classic Raimi begins in Kansas in 1.331 screen ratio in black and white introducing Oscar ""Oz"" Diggs (Franco) as he readies a fetching new assistant for his tent-show act. One twister later the movie expands to widescreen and color and almost immediately were reminded why were wearing our 3-D glasses. Ozs hot-air balloon lands in raging fantastical river rapids leading him to the first of the three witches of note.Mila Kunis in shiny black riding trou plays Theodora who falls instantly for the wizard sent she believes to save her kingdom. Weisz the one with the penchant for impromptu electric shocks is Evanora Ms. Trouble. Michelle Williams wonderfully cast counters the evil with her plaintive version of Glinda. The charlatan from Earth Francos top-hatted character must lead the revolution to restore order and democracy to Oz.As a series of sights which movies like these are ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is more like ""Oz the Digital and Relentless."" Certainly this is true in its final half-hour which seemed to me to be all explosions. The script comes from Mitchell Kapner who concocted the story and David Lindsay-Abaire hired on to bring some style and a few jokes. I laughed a few times mostly at Braffs voice work for the animated monkey with the goo-goo eyes.I suspect theres just enough heart in this sleek Tin Man of a project to connect with an audience. Preteens however may freak out whenever Theodoras simian minions reappear fangs at the ready. Its best to consider ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" as the bombastic 21st-century prelude to the 20th-century ""Oz"" we know. Its also the cinematic horse that crossed the finish line ahead of the Broadway musical ""Wicked"" itself a hugely successful prequel to Baums mythology. For years ""Wicked"" has been in various stages of preproduction on a film version and it likely will come before the cameras before too long. Baums yellow brick road -- digital or painted with or without songs -- was built to last. mjphillipstribune.comOz the Great and Powerful -- 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating PG (for sequences of action and scary images and brief mild language)Running time 210Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Animation (Movie Genre) Entertainment Movies Music Broadway Theater Wicked (musical) Rachel Weisz Oz the Great and Powerful Scenes from Oz the Great and Powerful 10 movies to see this winter Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising72deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0305-oz-great-powerful-2-20130307,0,7350194.column",200,ozthegreatandpowerful32,ozthegreatandpowerful,chicagotribune

Oz (James Franco). ""I want to be a great one."" A so-so magician and surpassing charlatan in the Baum Bros. Circus rolling through Kansas in 1905 Oscar aspires to merge the scientific acumen of Thomas Edison the Wizard of Menlo Park with the renowned legerdemain of Harry Houdini. But his powers of magic are bogus; customers become enraged when he confesses he cant make a crippled girl (Joey King) walk. And his only triumph as an escape artist has been to elude emotional responsibility he is relieved to hand off Annie (Michelle Williams) the sweet girl who loves him to a local drudge named John Gale. Clearly Oscar needs a comeuppance and change of venue to teach him that to be a good man is to be a great one. A tornado might do the trick. Sam Raimis Oz the Great and Powerful means to trade on and enlarge the view of the L. Frank Baum books as indelibly portrayed in MGMs 1939 The Wizard of Oz. Instead of depicting Dorothy Gales first trip to the Emerald City the script by Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire shows how the Wizard got to Oz and hopes to transport audiences to the wonderland that for many an infant moviegoer was first made manifest by the Judy Garland musical. (MORE TIMEs 1939 Review of The Wizard of Oz) Like Oscar though the picture is better at misdirection than making magic. Raimi who launched his career with the cheapo horror mini-masterpiece The Evil Dead before helming the blockbuster Spider-Man trilogy cant infuse the story with much verve or joy. Opening in black and white in the old-timey Academy screen ratio of the 1939 film Oz the Great and Powerful expands to glitzy color and widescreen 3-D when it arrives you-know-where but the switch doesnt pop; it just sort of seeps. With all the advances in effects technology the tornado here cant match the one that spirited Garlands Dorothy to Oz. And though a vista that suggests Monument Valley with snow has startling splendor other landscapes seem borrowed from Avatar and a waterfall plunge suggests only the prototype for a Disney World thrill ride without the thrills. The 3-D effects are plentiful -- hats lions and baboons jump off the screen and into your lap -- but the characters rarely lodge in the moviegoers heart. (MORE TIMEs Review of Spider-Man 3) Maybe an Oz project needs to sing. The great score by Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg gave a lyrical lift to the MGM film and Stephen Schwartzs numbers for the 2003 Broadway prequel Wicked underlined the passions and yearnings of its sorceress sisters. The three witches here -- the blond Glinda (Williams again) and her dark-haired siblings Theodora (Mila Kunis) and Evanora (Rachel Weisz) -- have their vagrant charms and charisma but they get no arias to explain themselves and Danny Elfmans background music serves less as a caress than a prod. Shorn of songs and dramatic black magic this Oz lands nowhere over the rainbow. For the most part its Wicked bad. (MORE TIMEs Review of the Broadway hit Wicked) That the Garland movie is a sacred text doesnt forbid all attempts to remake it or spin it off. Baum himself penned 13 sequels to his 1900 The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and in 1902 he wrote the book and lyrics for a lavish stage fantasy that played on Broadway for 464 performances. The first Oz movie in 1910 with Bebe Daniels as Dorothy spawned four sequels in the next four years. Over the next century Baums creatures came to life in Japanese Turkish Russian Brazilian Mexican and Lithuanian films. The black-cast Broadway musical The Wiz became a 1978 movie starring Diana Ross as Dorothy Michael Jackson as the Scarecrow and Lena Horne as Glinda the Good Witch. The Wachowskis in their third Matrix movie are just two of the hundreds of filmmakers who took inspiration from the Baum books and the 1939 movie classic. (MORE TIMEs Review of The Wiz) Walt Disney dreamed of an animated version of The Wonderful Wizard but MGM made its own movie first. In 1985 the Disney studios produced an eerie sequel Return to Oz directed and co-written by the eminent film editor (Apocalypse Now) and sound designer (The Conversation) Walter Murch. Ten-year-old Fairuza Balk played Dorothy whose mother listens to the girls muttered dreams of Oz and decides she needs a dose of electroshock therapy The land Dorothy returns to is closer to a Dust Bowl Kansas the Yellow Brick Road is gray rubble and the Emerald City a scarred ruin where citizens have been turned into frozen statuary. A childs nightmare of solitude and mortal threat Murchs movie was less a follow-up to the MGM film than its bitter antidote; yet it remains one of the few original visions of the Baum universe. Its sort of the Evil Dead of Oz movies. (MORE TIMEs Review of Return to Oz) A non-Dorothy prequel Oz the Great and Powerful has no children except for the wheelchair girl who in Oz is represented as a china doll with broken legs. She joins Finley (Zack Braff) ""a talking monkey in a bellboy uniform"" and a grumpy dwarf named Knuck (Tony Cox) to replace the trio of the Tin Man the Cowardly Lion and the Scarecrow that accompanied Dorothy on their voyage to the Emerald City. Their mission is to help Oscar navigate the Dark Forest overcome the Wicked Witchs flying baboons and steal her wand. (LIST All-TIME 100 Movies) The movie stirs to fitful life when the dark sisters appear. Weisz has never looked so glamorous as here purring Evanoras malevolence. Kunis gigantic eyes and wide face fill the screen with something akin to poignance when her acid tears etch furrows in her cheeks just before she eats a poisoned apple and turns all green and evil. Theres also a tinge of grandeur when Oscar employs the tricks of Edison (projecting a huge cinema image on the clouds) and Houdini (disappearing behind shall we say a curtain) to wow the Emerald City citizens. For a minute this Oz is almost up there with Martin Scorseses Hugo in demonstrating the power of movies to ""make the invisible real."" (MORE TIMEs Review of Hugo) Yet theres something road show something very Kansas about the enterprise. Some blame has to fall on the versatile Franco who can convincingly inhabit almost any character (catch his drug-lord dude in Spring Breakers also opening in March) but who lacks the con-man star quality of his sleaze turned superhero. His gummy smile is the rictus of a poseur second class; his musk is of flop sweat. When one hears that Robert Downey Jr. and Johnny Depp were in talks to play the lead role one imagines the giddy crafty showmanship Oscar could have embodied. Downey or Depp might have infused Oz the Great and Powerful with the charis-magic that eludes a movie that is not Great and only toward the end barely grazes Good.

"Oz the Great and Powerful 3 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Oz the Great and Powerful 3 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED INFO Oz the Great and Powerful Fair 3 stars Director Sam Raimi. Cast James Franco Michelle Williams Mila Kunis. Rating PG for sequences of action and scary images and brief mild language. RELATED NEWS Disney Sam Raimi gamble on return trip to Oz By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Mar 7 2013 230 PM The biggest and inevitable problem with ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is that there was already this other ""Oz"" movie that was pretty good.So youve got to give director Sam Raimi points for courage for not shying away from a cultural landmark. No Cowardly Lion he.Of course references like that dont really apply here. ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is a prequel to ""The Wizard of Oz"" telling us how the Wizard landed in a strange land with flying monkeys and wicked witches and whatnot. It will be years before Dorothy and her friends make their own more-memorable journey along the Yellow Brick Road.This trip isnt so notable. Its not bad. Some bits are enjoyable. But ultimately other than some genuinely impressive visuals it never makes a compelling-enough case to justify its existence.The story begins in Kansas in 1905 (and like the first part of ""The Wizard of Oz"" in black-and-white). An oily carnival magician named Oscar (James Franco) is busily fleecing a crowd and seducing women. Note to Oscar Leave the strongmans wife alone. Chased into a hot-air balloon Oscar escapes only to be sucked into a twister (sound familiar?) that lands him in Oz which conveniently happens to be his nickname.Now the film shifts to color. But not just any color. The hues are stunningly vibrant and rich and in 3-D they are also textured. Much like in ""Avatar"" its almost too much to take in at first.The first person Oz meets is Theodora (Mila Kunis) who is beautiful and kind and to his surprise a witch. Shes elated to see him because she believes him to be the wizard fulfilling a prophecy that he will save Oz from the wicked witch. She dreams of the two of them ruling Oz as king and queen happily ever after.But theres the matter of the wicked witch to be dealt with. Once at the castle in Emerald City Oz meets Theodoras sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz) who serves as the adviser to the king. She is not as convinced as her sister that Oz is the genuine item.Then there is a third sister and witch Glinda (Michelle Williams) who bears a striking resemblance to Annie a woman Oz has a relationship with in Kansas who visited him at the carnival to tell him a man had proposed to her ( clearly to try to get him to talk her out of it).There is indeed a wicked witch among them. Figuring out who isnt particularly difficult but there is another surprise in store thats pretty satisfying (though Im a sucker for origin stories). But if Oz is not who everyone thinks he is and he isnt how can he free the people from the wicked witchs reign of terror?Youve just got to believe. Thats the theme here which we know because Raimi and screenwriters Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire beat us over the head with it. No he may not be the wizard everyone expected Oz says at one point but he may be the wizard they need. Variations of this are also repeated several times which not only gets old but adds to the two-hours-plus running time.Oz will have to hit the road to save Oz. The yellow-brick road naturally. Hes accompanied by a loyal flying monkey (voice of Zach Braff) and a china doll (voice of Joey King). He will rely on his skills as a magician as much or more than his burgeoning moral clarity.A thing to remember about Oz though In ""The Wizard of Oz"" hes a fraud exposed by Dorothy not a hero. Thats not meant to give anything away (and it doesnt) but to explain some of his motives and to point out the difficulty of shaping the story around him.Were off to see the wizard Dorothy once famously sang. It doesnt dishonor the original but when it comes to ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" that same enthusiasm wont apply. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Frank Baums 1900 childrens novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz may not be great exactly but it is powerfully entertaining.A prequel that imagines the origins of the famous wizard character Oz the Great and Powerful ( out of four; rated PG; opens Thursday in some IMAX theaters and Friday nationwide) reveals his humble carny beginnings in Kansas and continues through his vaunted existence in the Emerald City. Oz is respectful to Victor Flemings beloved 1939 film classic incorporating famous lines and retaining plot points that audiences know well.In creating additional mythology director Sam Raimi has fashioned a viable escapist fantasy in its own right. His blend of computer-generated images and gorgeously designed sets enhances the storys theatrical quality. This is the rare case where 3-D doesnt feel superfluous but integral to the plot.PHOTOS Sneak peek at Oz the Great and PowerfulA few elements however might make viewers want to seek refuge in the original world of The Wizard of Oz. James Franco in the title role is stuck in satirical mode constantly sporting a raised eyebrow. While Franco is engaging as the rakish huckster Oscar ""Oz"" Diggs his smirky performance gets a bit old. But his offbeat persona does do justice to the comical dialogue.The opening credits and early scenes look influenced by Tim Burton but Raimis sensibility takes hold for the rest of the tale which is funny absorbing and visually resplendent.Opening in black-and-white a la The Wizard of Oz the film blossoms into glorious color once Oscar lands in the magical Land of Oz. He is transported by hot-air balloon until a tornado forces his crash landing into a lush landscape filled with vivid crimson flowers.Zach Braff gives an appealing voice to Finley the winged monkey in a bellhop costume who pledges lifelong allegiance to Oz. (The witchs minions have been upgraded to flying baboons.) Braff has a dual role (hes also Frank Oscars assistant in the Kansas traveling circus) as does Michelle Williams who plays Annie Oscars Kansas sweetheart and later Glinda the good witch.Both the computer-generated Finley -- who becomes Ozs conscience -- and China Girl a talking porcelain doll (voiced by Joey King) are on hand to appeal to the youngest audience members. But their characters will also charm older viewers.Rachel Weisz who plays Evanora is the standout among the witches. Her more tortured sister Theodora is played by Mila Kunis. Kunis and Williams are fine if forgettable in their roles but Weisz digs in to her malevolent part with gusto.Glindas goal is to convince Oscar that her land and its people are in trouble and that he is the answer to their predicament. The locals -- who include munchkins 10-foot-tall Emerald City guards and aged tinkers -- quake under the sway of the cruel Evanora. They cling to the prophecy that foretells of a wizard coming to restore peace.Oscar is an ambitious guy who aspires to greatness. But his efforts are mostly bluff and bluster. In the process of becoming a powerful wizard he learns to be a good man.Those looking for a cowardly lion dancing scarecrow or rusty tin man will be disappointed as will those who seek catchy tunes and effortless dancing. This is no musical.But taken on its own merits Oz the Great and Powerful is a grand adventure notable for its enchanting visual artistry.Oz Clip BananasSkip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Oz (James Franco) and Finley (Zach Braff) debate the wisdom of lying the prospect of killing an evil witch...and monkey stereotyping. 176 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 15 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/Wuv64g",http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~r/UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories/~3/5xZSmdv6CCc/,200,ozthegreatandpowerful36,ozthegreatandpowerful,usatoday

How I loved that original tag line in the first full-page ad that preceded the Broadway opening of the smash-hit musical Wicked. And it applies again to the 3D Disney extravaganza that serves as a 200 million prequel to one of the greatest MGM musicals of all time the 1939 classic The Wizard of Oz. Nothing in it comes close to the magic the originality or the everlasting entertainment value of the original which only cost 2.777 million and didnt use a single computer-generated graphic. This says more about how much better movies were in 1939 than they are today. Still I had enough fun to predict that history (or at least a tiny piece of it) seems destined to repeat itself. People just cant get enough of this stuff. To paraphrase Sam Goldwyn include me in. Its not the same Oz without Judy Garland the Cowardly Lion a dancing Scarecrow who only wants a brain a Tin Man who needs a lube job ""and Toto too"" to boot it forward. But Oz the Great and Powerful is not about how they got there. Its about how the Wizard got there first. In an assembly of passages from the 14 imaginative L. Frank Baum books the movie directed by Sam Raimi (Spider-Man) on sound stages in Michigan traces the origins of the Wizard--a second-rate con man named Oscar Diggs who is called Oz for short. Dont expect anything like the beloved Frank Morgan. This Oz is played by of all people the odd peripatetic slightly pretentious James Franco. (Robert Downey Jr. dropped out and Johnny Depp turned it down.) Between writing poetry editing literary magazines exhibiting his artwork in trendy galleries directing gay porno flicks like the forthcoming Interior. Leather Bar. and making dubious history as the worst M.C. in the history of the Academy Awards he also acts. Miscast in a stovepipe hat and long waistcoat sporting a turn-of-the-century moustache and carrying his bag of hokum in a strange briefcase he looks like Jack the Ripper. But cut him some slack. Hes supposed to be playing a jerk. And he grows on you. Like the original the film begins in a black-and-white prologue with Oz as an obnoxious egomaniac and fake illusionist in a cheap traveling carnival in 1905 Kansas. One foot ahead of the sheriff he gets sucked into the funnel of a ferocious cyclone/tornado and like Dorothy years later gets transported over the rainbow to the merry old land of Technicolor poppies flying baboons 3D butterflies and flowers the size of Volkswagens but disappointingly no ruby red slippers and only a handful of Munchkins who do not sing ""Ding Dong the Witch is Dead."" (This is not a musical and the thing I miss most is the score by Harold Arlen and E. Y. Harburg.) I also miss Margaret Hamilton but there are witches here--three of them to be exact. Glinda the good witch still travels in a bubble but instead of Billie Burke she is now Michelle Williams in a prom dress and a Mae West wig. Glinda believes the amateur magician is the true Wizard sent according to prophecy to save the good citizens of Oz from the wicked witch Evanora (Rachel Weisz) and her evil sister Theodora (Mila Kunis) who have their doubts about this weirdo Wizard. Oz and his two loyal new companions a flying monkey named Finley (voiced by Zach Braff who also plays the Wizards bumbling assistant back in Kansas) and a tiny broken china doll (voiced by Joey King) that Oz repairs with glue which hasnt been invented yet in Munchkin Land chug along a faded broken yellow brick road that is nothing like the one at MGM and is badly in need of a mason on their way to the Emerald City which now looks like a lime Jell-O mold. Oz and his friends face death in their dangerous new surroundings like the ones in countless Danny Kaye movies. Before its over the audience is assaulted by spears barrels hot sparks and a whopper of a fireworks show. Children will be delighted although at two hours and seven minutes the length alone might land younger toddlers in harms way from attention deficit. James Franco is a mixed blessing. In the scenes in which he faces innumerable perils adapting to his new life in Oz a lighter touch is needed than he is able to provide. As his lumpy humorless chores as an Oscar host proved comedy is not his forte. Still with so much big-budget razzle and dazzle there is always plenty to look at another surprise around every corner. I dont think L. Frank Baum is moaning in his grave. Tucked into the screenplay by Mitchell Kapner and playwright David Lindsay-Abaire who won the Pulitzer Prize in 2007 for his play Rabbit Hole there is even a tidy talisman to take home faith optimism and courage can conquer the forces of evil if they come from a truly Christmas heart. rreedobserver.com OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL Running Time 127 minutes Written by Mitchell Kapner David Lindsay-Abaire and L.

And for the most part Victor Flemings 1939 classic does just that. Its more interested in Judy Garlands ruby-slippered Dorothy and her three questing pals -- the Scarecrow the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion (not to mention Toto). The Wizard is a below-the-line supporting player at best. But who was that charlatan behind the curtain? Where did he come from? Thats the jumping-off point for Sam Raimis fractured new 3-D fairy tale Oz the Great and Powerful the latest big-budget prequel to emerge from Hollywoods origin-story conveyor belt. The film kicks off in black-and-white Kansas where we meet James Francos barnstorming small-time magician Oscar Diggs. Dressed in a snake-oil swamis turban and spouting the rat-a-tat stage patter of a born flimflam man Franco cons his yokel audience and runs afoul of the circus strongman after wooing the brutes girlfriend. So he hightails it in a hot-air balloon just as a twister approaches getting sucked into its angry maw and winding up... Well lets just say were not in Kansas anymore. As in the original the film segues from monochrome into glorious Technicolor when Franco arrives in Oz. There he meets a trio of beautiful witches (Mila Kunis gullible Theodora Rachel Weiszs calculating Evanora and Michelle Williams guileless Glinda) all of whom greet him as the magical Munchkin-lands prophesied savior. The audience knows going in that one of them will eventually turn evil but screenwriters Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire wisely delay the reveal. Unfortunately unlike in the far better Broadway spin-off Wicked the female leads remain fairly one-note. As does Franco who is as prolific as ever. Setting off on the yellow brick road to steal the mysterious Wicked Witchs wand (and become a better man in the process) the actor lacks the humor charm and gee-whiz wonder were meant to feel as he trades wisecracks with a flying monkey (Zach Braff channeling Nathan Lane) rescues a porcelain China Girl (Joey King) and soars above a field of poppies in a giant soap bubble. If hes not enchanted how are we supposed to be? Robert Downey Jr. was originally attached to play Oz and when you watch the miscast Franco its hard not to fantasize about the unpredictable fizz RDJ would have goosed the film with. As for Raimi on paper hed seem the ideal guy to take us back over the rainbow. He knows from reinventing familiar franchises after the Spider-Man trilogy. But while his Oz is like retinal crack he never seduces our hearts and minds. That may not matter at the box office since the Disney movie is squarely aimed at the kiddies. But I suspect that even they will be fidgeting during the last 45 minutes; like so many other recent tentpoles the film is stuffed with three endings too many. You cant blame Raimi for wanting to give us our moneys worth. But after a while you just want him to get to the Happily Ever After already.

Such is the cultural landmark status of MGMs 1939 The Wizard of Oz that any attempt to adjoin it on screen however laudable seems a fools errand from the get-go. The good news then is that Sam Raimis long lavish somewhat lumbering prequel is a more respectful retread than we might have expected from the studio behind Tim Burtons hideous near sacrilegious Alice in Wonderland. From its engaging black-and-white prologue introducing James Franco as Oscar a shyster Kansas conjuror set for a very unexpected journey to the widened aspect ratio and saturated Technicolor-style palette as hes carried to Oz by a familiar-looking tornado Raimis film is far more in thrall to the Hollywood classic than the more subversive Return to Oz was. As Oscar is mistakenly embraced by the people of Oz as their long-awaited leader charged with settling the battle between good (as represented by Michelle Williamss wholesome witch Glinda) and evil (vampishly wielded by Rachel Weiszs Evanora) hes effectively a smart-arse stand-in for Dorothy with the film treading a story path as indebted to the original as its explicitly referential production design. What it lacks rather like Oscar himself is any authentic magic the scripts post-Shrek wisecracks feel especially out of place and the over-processed digital landscapes cant match the beauty of handmade Hollywood artifice. As Mariah Carey trills a syrupy Ramp;B ballad over the closing credits were still left decidedly under the rainbow.

If youve got kids in the 9-12 age bracket - if theyre anything like the twelve year old boy I overheard commenting to his dad as they left - its worth the price of admission. It was good to finally see Zac Braff in a mainstream film and Mila Kunis is hot - green or not. Dont be put off by the review. Its basically a kids film and from that point of view (rather than judging it on canon and the films that came before) I think it works rather well.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 9 2013IanFeaturedVery poor and disappointing. The plot and characterisation is full of cliches and Franco as a lead is difficult to warm to. Kunis looks great in a pair of skin tight leather trousers but to no great surprise the American actress Williams dressed in white plays the heroine while the British Weisz conveniently dressed in black is the villainess. A cliche as tired and obvious as the film. Worth two stars just.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 9 2013IanFeaturedIf anything the review gives the film more credit than it deserves. This is a thoroughly disappointing film. It is like a supermodel looks great and classy but is shallow and empty. Kunis takes over the mantle of pretty woman in unnecessarily tight leather trousers from Gemma Arterton in the recent Hansel and Gretel film. Franco as a lead is poor and difficult to warm to much like the film. Braffs flying monkey cum servant is no donkey from Shrek as a character. At my local Cineworld Disney had obviously splashed the cash from the marketing budget with yellow brick road and large displays. They probably realise it must do well this weekend if they are to get their money back. Dont bother with the 3D as apart from a few flying spears and monkeys coming out of the screen at you it isnt worth it and in places it is out of focus. Just to put the icing on the cake and to no great surprise Williams the American Princess dressed all in white plays the heroine to Weisss black clad English villainess. A cliche as obvious as much of the rest of film. Just worth two stars.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map },http://www.timeout.com/london/film/oz-the-great-and-powerful,200,ozthegreatandpowerful39,ozthegreatandpowerful,timeout

Frank Baums childrens novels and one of the most beloved of all Hollywood movies into a wellspring of fresh product tie-ins and theme-park rides. Dont get me wrong Franco can be an inventive and unpredictable actor as in Harmony Korines upcoming Spring Breakers where he is a gold-toothed dreadlocked Big Bad Wolf leading astray four collegiate Red Riding Hoods. But hes fatally wrong for the part of Oz a huckster sideshow magician who finds himself somewhere over the rainbow trying to convince the good people of the kingdom bearing his name that hes their prophesied savior.Central to the movies conception of this pre-wizardly Oz is that hes a charismatic con artist who survives on his wits and leaves a trail of broken hearts in his wake--a role that calls for a Robert Preston or Burt Lancaster or director Sam Raimis own erstwhile muse Bruce Campbell with his knack for doing square-jawed heroism even while taking the piss out of it. (Among todays younger stars Nathan Fillion might have made a nice fit.) But Franco is such a shifty inward-facing eccentric that he seems like he should be selling tickets to some lurid cabinet of curiosities instead of snake oil to the masses. He delivers his lines with the sneering warble of the young Dennis Hopper and when he flashes his strained smile its more disturbing than dashing less young wizard than young Norman Bates.We first see Oz plying his prestidigitation in a sparsely populated Kansas tent circus. The time is 1905--that year of the first commercial cinemas the nickelodeons. And as envisioned by Raimi and screenwriters Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaire Oz is himself a disciple of Thomas Edison a practitioner of primitive cinematic illusions. In much the same spirit Raimi shoots this entire prologue not just in black-and-white but in the square ""Academy"" aspect ratio of movies of the pre-widescreen era switching to color and CinemaScope only after a rogue twister scoops up our half-wit Houdini and deposits him in the magical land of outsourced CGI. And what a land it is a gaudy Day-Glo freak-out modeled on the 1939 Victor Fleming/Judy Garland classic (complete with spiraling yellow brick road and art-deco Emerald City) but amped up with so much phosphorescent flora and photorealistic fauna that this Oz might share a zip code with Avatars Pandora. But wait theres more babbling brooks and crumbling cliffs and winged insects fluttering out from the corners of the frame until you feel sure youve seen everything modern technology can--but probably shouldnt--do all at once.Film Details Oz The Great and Powerful RatingPG GenreSciFi/Fantasy Running Time127 More Info Trailer After more than enough of that Oz the man sees a more resplendent vision that of Mila Kunis owner of the sultriest come-hither gaze in many a movie epoch decked out in a crimson jacket and matching wide-brimmed hat that Veronica Lake could have worn no better. Its too bad that Kuniss Theodora isnt the center of her own Oz movie a nominal ""good"" witch whose passions rage louder than most who gives her heart too willingly and who when betrayed turns positively green with jealousy. (Havent we all been on the wrong end of that relationship?) Shes still the most dimensional character in this 3-D affair which otherwise squanders two of the most resourceful actresses in movies today Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams as glowering rival spell-casters Evanora and Glinda. Memo to Hollywood Can you please issue a temporary prohibition on movies that culminate in two magical beings unleashing competing bursts of electromagnetic fury from their fingertips?Whither Sam Raimi in all this? You dont need a crystal ball to divine parallels between the Evil Dead directors own journey to the top of the Hollywood A-list and Ozs trek towards the gold-lined coffers of Emerald City; but if the irony is lost on anyone its Raimi himself who puts this movie dutifully through its Disneyfied paces with precious little of the gently mocking humor that graced his Spider-Manfilms (at least the first two)--or for that matter much humor at all. Occasionally a touch of Raimis pranksterism breaks through chiefly in the form of ""China Town"" a literal dinnerware suburb where Oz comes to the aid of a fractured china doll (also the movies most special special effect). More often Oztilts towards the mawkish as the sham wizard learns the value of selflessness and an incessant Danny Elfman score tugs so shamelessly at your tear ducts that it would make the Tin Man surrender his heart on the spot. Throughout I longed for the Raimi of old--or even of 2009s deliciously gross throwback Drag Me to Hell--to send one of the Wicked Witchs shrieking winged baboons down to put Ozs simpering monkey valet (voiced by Zach Braff) out of his--and our--misery.

James Franco goes from carny conman to reluctant messiah in this ingenious prequel to the 1939 classic In revisiting the iconic 1939 classic ""The Wizard of Oz"" (and the L. Frank Baum novels that inspired it) there are any number of missteps that director Sam Raimi (""Spider-Man"" ""Drag Me to Hell"") and screenwriters Mitchell Kapner (""The Whole Nine Yards"") and David Lindsay-Abaire (""Rabbit Hole"") could have taken on that particular Yellow Brick Road. That ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" is so thoroughly effective both on its own terms and as a prequel to one of the most beloved movies ever made indicates that this team has magic to match any witch or wizard. Its an achievement thats doubly miraculous since the film falls squarely into two genres that have produced some of the worst movies of the last decade the sequel/prequel/reboot/retread and what I call ""storybook characters in combat."" But this is no ""Jack the Giant Slayer"" or ""Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters""; rather than tell us that everything we know about Oz is wrong the filmmakers take what we already know about the wonderful wizard and thread it into a tale about the magic behind cinema itself. Also read Will Pricey Oz Stay on Track After Jack Got Whacked at Box Office? When we first meet Oz (James Franco) -- its a nickname for Oscar -- hes a two-bit skirt-chasing magician on a dusty Kansas fairway entertaining the rubes and dreaming of bigger and better things. After telling his ex-girlfriend Annie (Michelle Williams) that shes better off marrying John Gale (the movie is loaded with ""Wizard of Oz"" shout-outs but never gets oppressively cutesy about it) Oz hops into a promotional hot-air balloon to escape the clutches of a strongman hes cuckolded. Cue tornado. Landing in Oz he is greeted by the beautiful Theodora (Mila Kunis) who tells him he must be the wizard whose arrival was prophesied and who will save the kingdom of Oz. Royal advisor Evanora (Rachel Weisz) informs Oz that to take the throne (and the royal treasury through whose coins Oz swims like Daffy Duck) he must kill a wicked witch. Aided by sidekicks Finley (voiced by Zach Braff) a talking monkey and the porcelain China Girl (Joey King) he braves the dark forest only to find that Glinda (Williams again) is in fact a good witch and that Evanora is playing both sides against the middle. Just when it feels like ""Oz"" is going to be the umpteenth movie about a Joseph Campbell reluctant hero going into battle to save the day -- which admittedly this totally is -- Oz learns to use his abilities at showmanship and chicanery for the welfare of the Munchkins and the Tinkers and the other residents of Oz. (As opposed to Alice in Wonderland suddenly turning into Joan of Arc for example.) And as Glinda points out he can aspire to something even better than greatness; namely goodness. While its easy to imagine the eventual Disney Parks attraction based on this film (from the tornado to Ozs travel down waterfalls in the balloons basket to the strategic use of fireworks) ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" remains compelling and surprising throughout. Franco doesnt radiate fake charm in the style of say Robert Prestons immortal Prof. Harold Hill in ""The Music Man""; hes a little grungier and more desperate but no less a flim-flam man. Kunis and Weisz get to be sexy and malevolent but its Williams who shines with the tougher role of making the good girl interesting. ""Oz"" is a marvel to behold from the traditional segue from black and white to color (Raimi ups the ante by playing around with aspect ratio as well and in 3D no less) to the grand vistas of Oz itself. (The Emerald City at a distance still looks like a matte painting but it plays like a tip of the hat to the original.) The visual effects are stunning particularly Finley and the China Girl who are some of the most amusing (and moving) CGI characters Ive seen interact with humans onscreen. Pay extra for the 3D treatment; this is one of those rare times when its worth it. (Oh and remember how the witch and the flying monkeys from ""The Wizard of Oz"" scared the crap out of you as a kid? Raimi doesnt hold back in that department either. Not that you shouldnt take the little ones but bear in mind that Raimis monkeys are even more disturbing.) Motion pictures themselves began as a lowbrow mass entertainment similar in stature to carnival attractions so its no surprise that Oz is an early champion of the zoopraxiscope. In a way then Raimi and his writers arent just paying homage to ""The Wizard of Oz""; theyve made a hero of the first movie director one who uses those flickering illusions to change the world.

By this point -- about one-third in -- its clear Franco is as miscast here as he was as an Oscar host. And that director Sam Raimis dull kitschy and overlong patchwork is sadly an epic fail -- despite the presence of Michelle Williams Rachel Weisz and Mila Kunis as a trio of witches. JAMES FRANCO THE WIZARD OF FLAWS Unlike Disneys 1985 flop sequel ""Return to Oz this prequel goes out of is way to invite invidious comparisons to beloved 1939 classic. It opens in a black-and-white (square screen) Kansas where a seedy circus illusionist named Oscar Diggs (Franco) learns his former sweetheart (Williams) is going to marry a man named Gale. Thats the closest the film comes to even indirectly referencing the beloved Dorothy Gale though the thin script -- by Mitchell Kapner (""The Whole Nine Yards) and playwright David Lindsay-Abaire (the animated ""Wizard knockoff ""Robots) -- sends Oscar (stage name Oz) on a suspiciously similar journey. When the womanizing Oscar seeks to make a quick escape in a balloon from an angry strongman a tornado blows him off course into Oz. There he first encounters Theodora (Kunis) a witch who mistakes him for the wizard prophesied by the murdered king. She takes Oscar to the Emerald City where Theodoras older sister and royal advisor Evanora (Weisz) tells him the throne and untold wealth is his -- all Oscar has to is kill a third witch their sworn enemy Glinda (Williams again). Its not exactly hard to figure out whos good and whos bad here or who will end up becoming the Wicked Witch of the West (technically called the Baum-accurate Wicked Witch of the South for legal reasons). Even if you havent seen the spoiler-filled trailers or Disney merchandise. A much much bigger problem is that its hard to care what happens to the cowardly greedy Oscar and his sidekicks an annoying flying monkey named Finley (voiced by Zach Braff who also appears briefly in the Kansas prologue) and a boring miniature China doll (Joey King). Eventually Oscar leads a siege of Emerald City that seems to go on longer than ""The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King. Its all impersonally directed by Raimi (the ""Spider-Man trilogy) who resorts to a barrage of special effects -- some admittedly impressive -- in an attempt disguise the absence of the emotional resonance and coherent storytelling that made ""The Wizard of Oz so memorable. The prequel isnt helped by its casting. Robert Downey Jr. an early contender for the title role would have been a far better choice for the fast-talking Oscar than Franco whose wan postmodern approach often makes him come off as if hes playing an actor playing Oscar. Weisz gives the films only good performance as the scheming English-accented Evanora. Williams does what she can as the beautiful but sickeningly sweet Glinda who was kept off-screen for much of the earlier film. Kunis fares worst as misguided Theodora done in by a poor script and some truly unfortunate makeup and prosthetic breasts. Everything here seems off -- and not just by the legal necessity of avoiding infringing Warners copyright on the 1939 films depiction of the munchkins (who deliver one chorus of song before Oscar stops them) the Yellow Brick Road the Dark Forest that field of poppies etc. The interior of the Emerald City bears an unfortunate resemblance to a Las Vegas casino hotel while too many landscapes have the kitschy overblown look of something mass-produced by the late shopping mall artist Thomas Kinkade. Under the circumstances the dim images resulting from wearing 3-D glasses is almost a blessing. ""Oz the Great and Powerful will likely appeal mostly to kids under 6 who have had minimal exposure to ""The Wizard of Oz -- though parents should be warned this is 26 minutes longer than the original and contains scary attacks by fanged flying baboons that test the outer limits of the PG rating. As for the rest of us Save your money and wait for the new 3-D version of the 1939 classic that Warner Bros. has promised for later this year.

I did a quick dash down the stairs and to the gents forgoing my one and only opportunity to skip through a hallway singing ""were off to take a whizzer."" With great speed I settled back in my seat to find James Francos transported Kansas huckster racing in histrionic fear with his computer generated compatriots - pretty much just as Id left them. I turned to my wife and whispered ""whatd I miss?"" The blank look she shot me in response said it all. The thing is this neither she nor I disliked ""Oz The Great and Powerful."" Indeed as one who holds great fondness for the early more aggressive work of Sam Raimi I found sequences in this film to be his best in years. But dont think for a minute that its story is anything other than a joke a mere excuse to play around with outrageous colors and let actors chomp on some splendid digital scenery. Considering how these movies usually go this attitude is wonderfully refreshing. The opening of ""Oz"" is remarkable. With a funhouse credits sequence that exploits 3D like a kid let behind the ice cream counter Raimi sets up shop at a traveling circus. There a somewhat rakish magician (Franco) is caught mid-bullshit with a local gal hes got his eyes on. On stage his stentorian tone and hokey act have a genuine charm. These short scenes among the tents is some of the most loving ""join the circus"" stuff since Woody Allens ""Shadows and Fog"" from 1991. When an angry singlet-wearing strong man chases Franco away his hot air balloon (dont ask) heads straight into a tornado. Evoking Raimis former leading man Bruce Campbell Franco turns his face to jelly as the camera zooms in and around him at unconventional angles dented calliopes flying at his head until the image expands from a 43 ratio to widescreen and color takes over. Hes landed in the land of Oz where hes soon introduced to witches (Mila Kunis and Rachel Weisz) talking monkeys and a little girl made of ceramic. In classic Preston Sturges form hes mistaken for the prophesied Wizard who will bring peace and order to the realm. Franco does little to protest the claim especially once he sees his throne scepter and Scrooge McDuck money pit. Frankly the characters dont matter. The dialogue doesnt matter. The performances however are quite extraordinary. Francos delivery of ""so long suckers"" does a great deal to inform this movie. Moments later in a lake he shouts ""I cant swim"" Theres no one else around so you wouldnt be wrong in asking ""whos he talking to?"" The raised eyebrows and slightly silly tone is all a little bit of a put on but not so much that kids (or idiots) will notice. Neither Franco nor anyone else goes full Depp in this one. Milking it more than Franco however is Michelle Williams whose dimples ought to have their own SAG card. As Glinda the Good Witch each moment shes on screen is a complex waltz between irony and sincerity. Its the type of performance Catherine OHara would give in one of the more high concept ""SCTV"" sketches - the ones where there werent any noticeable jokes. Only here it is in a gorgeous costume beside state of the art effects. Now finally we get to the real star of the movie Oz. You dont get much more iconic than the Emerald City and Raimis team nails it. Theres a fealty to the original film (lots of red smoke the guards costumes etc.) but its all done up big and beautiful. The third act of ""Oz The Great and Powerful"" goes on and on and on and under normal circumstances Id be tapping my watch in anticipation of that final boss fight. This time however the visual aspects of the film more than made up for my complete lack of emotional attachment. Raimi made a choice and it payed off. By treating the scenario as ""almost a joke"" I stayed engaged because I was amused. Francos bluffing big speech to the troops at the end was so goofy I couldnt help but laugh. Normally by this stage in a Hollywood effects-driven movie (say a Wrath of the Titans or Jack the Giant Slayer) Im just slumped over in my seat waiting for death. By lowering the stakes to the point of near-non existence Raimi manages to keep things engaging which is a very real act of wizardry in and of itself.

Offering an eye-tickling but gaudily depersonalized Land of Oz populated by younger sexier versions of well-known characters (most incongruously the Wicked Witch of the West) this elaborate exercise in visual Baum-bast nonetheless gets some mileage out of its game performances luscious production design and the unfettered enthusiasm director Sam Raimi brings to a thin simplistic origin story. The smash success of ""Wicked"" the stage tuner adapted from Gregory Maguires much more intricate and morally complicated ""Oz"" prequel showed that L. Frank Baums richly imagined universe still holds significant interest for audiences worldwide. With its culturally resonant imagery state-of-the-art technology and strong family appeal Disneys first excursion into this realm since Walter Murchs ""Return to Oz"" nearly 30 years ago should enjoy a hefty yellow-brick load in theatrical release that will only be amplified by 3D ticket premiums and bountiful ancillary opportunities. Abundant indicators of commercial success and faultless production values aside theres a persistent sense of artifice here something admittedly not lost on a story thats very much about the power of technology and the magic inherent in a skillfully executed illusion. Yet it still rings hollow in a way that prevents full surrender leaving the viewer with an immediate desire to revisit the still-wondrous 1939 film and to a lesser extent the original Baum novels credited as the inspiration for Mitchell Kapner and David Lindsay-Abaires screenplay. (The filmmakers had to navigate a veritable poppy field of legal issues to steer clear of copyrighted and trademarked elements from the MGM film now owned by Warner Bros.) Although Dorothy is nowhere in sight attentive listeners will catch a fleeting reference to her origins in the films exquisite prologue which a la ""The Wizard of Oz"" unfolds on a windy strip of Kansas prairie. Rendered in black-and-white and framed in Academy ratio the sequence works as a luminous standalone tribute to the wonders of old-fashioned trickery and showmanship as practiced by traveling circus magician Oscar Diggs (James Franco) whose vaudeville-style act is a marvel of wires trapdoors faux hypnosis and do-it-yourself sound effects. Oscar is a handsome rogue a sly con artist and an expert levitator and seducer of women qualities that will prove at once crucial and dangerous when a twister blows his hot-air balloon off course and deposits him in the vibrant-colored Land of Oz where no fewer than three beautiful and powerful witches wind up vying for his attention. These include the naive emotionally susceptible Theodora (Mila Kunis); her older colder sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz); and their sworn nemesis Glinda (Michelle Williams) a beauteous blonde whose motives are initially shrouded in secrecy. Crucial to these womens competing agendas is the question of whether Oscar is the all-powerful wizard who as prophesied will ascend to the throne of the Emerald City and deliver Oz from evil. Disneys marketing campaign has worked to generate some suspense over the question of who will eventually become the Wicked Witch of the West although even modestly Oz-savvy viewers will have no trouble guessing which witch is which before the truth is revealed halfway through. Suffice to say that the transformation is poorly motivated at best and the unlucky girl in question sporting not only the requisite green skin but also an eyeful of cleavage seems a better candidate for top honors at a West Hollywood Halloween bash than for the mantle of Margaret Hamilton. Such comparisons to ""The Wizard of Oz"" are not only unavoidable but actively invited by Raimis film which within its legal restrictions carefully mimics its 1939 forebear -- from the early monochrome-to-color shift signaling that were not in Kansas anymore to the device of having key supporting characters pop up on both sides of the proverbial rainbow. To their credit scribes Kapner and Lindsay-Abaire have taken pains to incorporate previously unfilmed elements from Baums original work. Pointedly in this version Glinda hails from the South not the North; the (racially diversified) Munchkins are joined by the similarly friendly but lesser-known Quadlings; and a key role is played by the fragile all-porcelain China Girl (Joey King) who joins Oscar and his benign winged-monkey companion Finley (voiced by Zach Braff) on their journey. Quite apart from the question of whether the picture lives up to its various inspirations however ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" finally falls short by dint of a too-timid imagination. In straining for an all-ages simplicity the script comes off as merely banal full of flat repetitive dialogue about whos good whos wicked and most incessantly whether Oscar is a real wizard an opportunistic scoundrel or perhaps both. Not until the third act does the film start to jell with a couple of arresting setpieces that neatly demonstrate how pluck resourcefulness and an endless supply of tricks can equal and even overcome real magic. Raimis genre credentials made him as ideal a match for this production as any and he attacks the material with palpable vigor countering the thinness of the story with visuals that can feel by turns excessive and transporting. Gary Jones and Michael Kutsches lovingly detailed costumes and Robert Strombergs multihued sets take on an almost radioactive glow in Peter Demings widescreen cinematography and the use of tracking and crane shots is inspired the camera pulling back on occasion to observe the action at a painterly remove. This marks the first time Raimi has worked with the stereoscopic format and hes applied it with abundant care and precision. Bob Murawskis editing meshes seamlessly with the 3D-lensed imagery to produce a fluid genuinely multidimensional experience whose eye-popping effects -- a swirl of fog rolling out of the frame; blossoms that turn out to be butterflies -- are executed with an enchanting dexterity and playfulness. In a real sense ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" has a certain kinship with George Lucas ""Star Wars"" prequels in the way it presents a beautiful but borderline-sterile digital update of a world that was richer purer and a lot more fun in lower-tech form. Here too the actors often look artificially superimposed against their CG backdrops though the intensity of the fakery generates its own visual fascination. The indie experiments with which Franco has been recently preoccupied lend an interesting subtext to his casting as a genial humbug and the actor fills the Wizards shoes vest and top hat with slippery ingratiating charm. Among the three witches Kunis Theodora is a bit lacking in dramatic stature; Weiszs Evanora strikes the right notes of icy ambition; and Williams who has rarely looked more radiant onscreen is a bewitching presence indeed making Glinda more than just another bubblehead.

Amanda Greathouse says March 30 2013 at 448 pm The Wizard of Oz was my favorite movie as a child. 50th edition collectors VHS? Had it. Commemorative plaque of Dorothy had it. Ruby slippers had those too. While I thought that there were a few issues with Kunis character getting more of the focus than she should have and it seemed a shame that Glindas direction was changed for the most part I thought the movie was fantastic. I literally cried when they first got to Oz. It was like seeing the Oz that -I- pictured as a child as being beyond the borders of where Garlands Dorothy visited. It was so beautiful to look at that it almost hurt. Franco I thought was brilliant as Oscar. He did a fantastic job of being a snake-oil-salesman of a magician and did the malcontent of being stuck in a small dream while dreaming large very very well. In all honesty I was kept in a measure of suspense over Kunis characters fate even as a fan of the original. Not because I forgot the story of the original either but because Glinda also hailed from a different direction so it was possible that Kunis character did so. In fact the movie made my husband cry too though for an entirely different reason. For him it was that he related very closely with Francos character and Oscars love of such legends of invention as Tesla and Edison and dreamed of being a great man but in the end... even Glinda did not see greatness in him but goodness instead. It was when he put it that way that I almost wanted to cry myself. While it lacks in some of the joyous whimsy and overt comedy of the original and runs a bit longer than it perhaps ought to... if you loved Oz as a child go see this in IMAX 3-d.... it will make you cry for the beauty of seeing the things you pictured growing up come to life and in such vivid and glorious detail. In a way it was like a homecoming. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone although it can apparently be quite sad. Reply matt rasey says March 11 2013 at 1035 pm this movie is awful i was really hoping it would be great as was its distant kin however the filming in 3 d was a burn on the eyes and the CG was over the ring to say the least they also focused way to much on kunis when she kept showing the model pose and the close ups were not her friend so all in all i would have to say this movie was over hyped and under cast and over priced for the money that was spent to make itsadly you cant remake a bad movie that never really had a chance and even with a good story line which they had it was thought out more on laptop than in a actors studio or stage runs so no one had any clue how bad it would be til it hit the screen but as we now know it was too late to be revived all i can say is shame on Disney for messing with one of the greats and shame on Kunis and Franco for not getting acting lessons before they started shooting this film.dont waste your money or eyes Reply clayton sands says March 11 2013 at 1038 am complely entertained by this...saw in 3-D.. I have always found the orginal Oz..overly long dated amp; always felt Judy Gardland was miscasted.. too old... The new Oz made great use of every trick in the CG bag of tricks..and no corny songs... Sometimes pure entertainment works... Reply Dr.Cast says March 8 2013 at 756 am Just how SOON will the ""other visitors"" follow the Great OZ....mmm? Reply Jeff Lee Movies says March 7 2013 at 1036 am The Kansas part was funny and the finale was rousing. The long march to Oz in the middle was as thin as ice and boring. Reply therealeverton says March 1 2013 at 1217 am As wonderful as the most popular Oz film (not the first) is surely it could also be described as ""dramatically thin""? And yes the Judy Garland starer remains one of my favourite films from childhood. Reply Gregory G. Stangal says February 28 2013 at 914 pm Tired of the bogus films coming out in so-called 3-D. I fine the process dulls the projected image and in most of the 3-D movies nothing comes off the screen; just depth Reply See All 7 Comments More Film News from Variety The Power of Content Westworld Divorce amp; Insecure Get Premiere Date On HBO Lindsay Lohan Without Engagement Ring Egor Tarabasov Wedding...

TWITTER A miscast James Franco and a lack of charm and humor doom Sam Raimis prequel to the 1939 Hollywood classic. Oz the Wimpy and Weak would be more like it. A sadly unimaginative prequel to the 1939 perennial that remains one of the few Old Hollywood films that many modern kids continue to see this long-in-the-works effects extravaganza feels stillborn from its opening minutes and never springs to life even with the arrival of the witches and the flying monkeys. Fatally miscast as the con man wizard James Franco possesses none of the charm and humor necessary to carry Oz the Great and Powerful. All the same eager children undoubtedly will go along for the ride and probably be fine with it meaning that Disney -- with the help of a relentless promotional campaign built-in interest and general anticipation -- might attract a big enough portion of its billion-dollar Alice in Wonderland audience from the same release date three years ago to succeed in spite of the deficiencies of whats onscreen. ""Im just not the man you wanted me to be"" Francos Kansas conjurer confesses well into his attempt to transform himself into a wizard come to rescue Oz from the torments of the witch and this is certainly not the film many longtime L. Frank Baum fans will have wanted to see. Just as dispiriting as Walter Murchs 1985 revisitation Return to Oz Sam Raimis oddly stilted production is both in structure and some specifics a vague rehash of Victor Flemings beloved classic only with the wizard character rather than Dorothy being introduced to the wonders and terrors of Oz. Instead of soaring off into some exciting unexplored territory the script by Mitchell Kapner (The Whole Nine Yards) and David Lindsay-Abaire (Rabbit Hole Robots) ties itself too closely to its progenitor mirroring some scenes in action (a tornado blowing the title character from Kansas to Oz the wizard bestowing parting gifts on minions) and even dialogue (the wizards repeated use of the phrase ""Where I come from"" among others) without ever coming up with anything sparklingly original of its own. This is a rehash and a hodgepodge of the original minus the ruby slippers and glorious songs. PHOTOS Oz the Great and Powerful How Sam Raimi Brought the Legend Back to Life Due homage is paid by presenting the initial 20 minutes in black-and-white and the old standard 1.33 Academy ratio. Instead of meeting an old charlatan we encounter the fast-talking young Oscar Diggs (Franco) hustling both his customers and co-workers at the Baum Family Circus in 1905 Kansas. A lovely local girl (Michelle Williams) is clearly besotted with him but he tells her to marry someone else saying its his ambition to be not a good man but a great one like his heroes Harry Houdini and Thomas Edison. Very quickly the disappointments begin accumulating. The tornado ride to Oz far from being enhanced by modern special effects amounts to nothing compared to the wondrous one offered to audiences 74 years ago. Instead of finding an equivalent to the great coup de cinema in the original of opening a black-and-white door onto a color world in the new film color just innocuously seeps in once the imposter arrives in Oz (and he doesnt even get to land on a witch). Little about this Midwestern fraud could make even a child believe that hes a real wizard and indeed he disavows the role at first. But his arrival fulfills a local prophecy that a great wizard will arrive and liberate the population from the broom-riding old crone and the promise of great riches inspires him to give it a try. The main story then becomes one of an unprepared man having greatness thrust upon him a process fostered by his growing relationship with Glinda the Good Witch (Williams again). As before some Kansas characters receive Oz-dwelling counterparts so also joining in his quest are tiny flying monkey Finley (Zach Braff) his assistant at the circus and a broken miniature China doll (Joey King) a girl in a wheelchair in Kansas. Unfortunately these boringly one-note characters cant begin to compare with their equivalents in the original -- Scarecrow Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion -- so the burden rests entirely upon Franco and Williams whose dialogue exchanges are repetitive and feel tentative. That leaves it for the evil side to take up the slack and no matter their talent and allure even the combined force of Rachel Weisz and Mila Kunis cant begin to equal Margaret Hamilton when it comes to raising shivers and relishing nefarious power. Weisz is Evanora an official royal adviser whose true nature is hidden at first while Kunis plays her good-girl younger sister Theodora (who unlike her British-accented sibling speaks Americanese). Theodora is manipulated by both Evanora and Oscar who is obliged to prove himself much like Dorothy by destroying the wand of the Wicked Witch. STORY Ozs Journey 3 Studio Chiefs Multi-Ethnic Munchkins James Franco Scores 7 Million The journey of Oscar and his dull companions provides a bounty of opportunities for visual splendor -- on the ground as in the Dark Forest and in the air when they travel via large transparent bubbles. As professional and accomplished as the effects appear in 3D however there is something almost cartoon-like about most of the scenery and backdrops which are mostly placid and benign rather than spooky or threatening. Even the nasty flying monkeys (or baboons as they seem to be here) possess none of the eerie malevolence that they did in all their wired splendor in the original film; here theyre mainly used for momentary 3D shock effects as they bare their fangs coming right at the camera. But even if the script atmosphere and supporting characterizations were more inspired one would still be stuck with a central role and performance that leave a great deal to be desired. Oscar/Oz needed to have been played by someone with a slippery shape-changing personality a beguiling gift for gab and the suggestion of untapped inner resources a young Kevin Kline or Steve Martin or as originally cast Robert Downey Jr. As he prattles on with his hesitations and demurrals about his candidacy for wizardom and later devises methods for combating evil with old inventors called the Tinkers Francos wizard simply does not inspire interest confidence or amusement. The actors seem like an understudy filling in for a big star in a role that demanded one. Theres no delight in Ozs deceptions no sense that this guy could sell anything to anybody. His vocal readings have a sameness to them that is lulling. Among the main actors Weisz gives it the best shot and its a fair bet she could have excelled with better lines and a tinge of camp -- an element the film is completely without and sorely misses (a contemporary Oz of ones dreams might have included Weisz and Penelope Cruz as witches directed by Pedro Almodovar). As her sister Kunis never seems to get on the same wavelength; her character long remains in a sort of limbo a status reflected in her uncertain performance. Williams introduces what little warmth there is here while most of the supporting actors have been directed to express nothing but bland sincerity and hope with pleading eyes. Theres neither subversive nor even a gleeful bone in this films body which means there can be no fun in the evil or in villains being vanquished. Similarly missing is any zest to the storytelling. Quite the opposite of the great earlier film the Oz here is a dull place to be. Given the choice you might even consider going back to Kansas.
