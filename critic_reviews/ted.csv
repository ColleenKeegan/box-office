Seven-year-old John wishes his teddy could come to life and be his best friend forever. A star shoots by the wish is granted delight ensues. Which is all very Spielberg. Then the bear works the talk shows becomes a has-been and turns into a feckless hanger-on as John becomes a thirtysomething delayed adolescent with a taste for bongs and kitsch pop culture. That bits very Seth MacFarlane. Ted is the first feature from the creator of Family Guy and American Dad and shares their hyper-savvy sense of humour and yen for man-creature buddy dynamics. Though not as nuanced or engaging as Brian the dog from Family Guy or Roger the alien from American Dad the computer-animated Ted - voiced by MacFarlane - is of the same type surfing on his share of neuroses but basically the smartest guy in the room. If he were a guy. Whether you enjoy the movie will depend on how much you like Ted. There are plenty of strong gags of the MacFarlane school and the funniest moments involve Ted in full rude flow either holding forth or engaged in brawling partying and other unteddybearlike activities. Other than that theres little going on. MacFarlane opts for a predictable story in which the adult John (Mark Wahlberg) is under pressure from his girlfriend (Mila Kunis) to get his shit together. Shes fending off a slimeball at work and Ted is being bugged by a fan (Giovanni Ribisi) and thats it. The plot runs out of steam squandering its jeopardy and limping towards a cop-out climax with no technical flair to keep things going.In many ways Ted is reminiscent of Ricky Gervaiss misfiring film vehicles Ghost Town and The Invention of Lying narcissistically over-reliant on the supposed charms of their leads these movies are banal as films and mildly objectionable in tone. Women are long-suffering stooges who either crack up at the blokes gags or roll their eyes at their childishness - neatly illustrated by a playground insistence on the inherent snigger-worthiness of homosexuality. Sure MacFarlane you can make us laugh but its time to grow up. Seriously.

The politically incorrect mantra of seth Macfarlane and its success is only possible due to the desensitisation of the masses to whom nothing of this sort is taken seriously and while the desensitisation of young people is extremely worrying in some regards I believe that comedy really should have no boundaries as in the end making light of the world in all its forms without genuine animosity or predjudice is in itself a good thing. The issue with this film is that it makes cheap use of its incorrectness by merely referencing and name dropping without any substance whatsoever. As paradoxical as it sounds there is such a thing as tasteful bad taste and this film foregoes this completely. It is a symptom of our culturally vacant time that we are veering towards self-parody of our own culture as a defence mechanism against our lack of ideas and seth macfarland is at the forefront of this but while self parody can be incredibly funny and have some value ted and family guy refuse to engage with anything they relate to... all this film contains is gross out humour which has lost all its edge due to over exhaustion and pop culture references which are as worthless and hollow as the film itself... in this way seth erects a mirror to show the banality of the void inherent in a large part of our creative output and society and then actively encourages us to join in while giving us the illusion of some kind of detachment. We are lead to believe that we are the ones above from all the stupidity in life and somehow enlightened when in actual fact we are watching a moronic talking bear for an hour and a half. Even if my views so far are not a concern for you and unless you happen to find the idea of a lude bear in itself utterly hilarious you should not watch this film because unlike family guy its comic timing is awful the jokes arent even funny in a brainless kind of way and it concludes with half an hour of unadulterated sap worthy of the most disarmingly dull chick flick.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 4 2012JockFeaturedGremlins is much better than this rubbish.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 28 2012JazzyyFeaturedI LOVE THIS FILM Some rude parts hahahabut some were hilarious (eg.

I wanted to walk out half way through but stayed to see if it got better however i was again disappointed. I cannot get my head around how this film has some 4 star ratings What is funny about casual rascism? THE worst film i have ever had the misfortune to sit through. I would not watch this film again if you paid me.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 26 2012GemmatjFeaturedWas a funny movie there s lots of warnings about the content in the ads n marketing  If u like family guy you ll like it  Im Scottish and thought the meat hole pudding scene was hilarious.  Some people taking everything too seriously .... Its a film at the end of the day its not real ..... Its more of a Tom com for guys  As the storyline is weighed on by walberg and kunis relationship  Some of that story was a bit cheesy  Laughed a lot throughout though  Do did everyone else in the cinema FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 24 2012racistFeaturedYes the racist humour falls flat as it should do. Someone should tell these script-writers that things arent funny simply because theyre irreverent. They also have to actually BE FUNNY. Overall though quite a witty take on what would happen if someone really did magic their teddy bear to life plus some quite amusing relationshippy stuff and lots and lots of film references that were totally suited to someone of my age it seemed BUT - Brandon Routh is the best superman ever And isnt he married?FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 23 2012jasmineFeaturedThe talking teddy seems to be having somethimg of a moment right now right across book fiction and movies. Its not new having first been introduced in ""Brideshead Revisited"" set in the 1920s with Aloysius the bear and there are currently a few novels with teddy bear detectives out there. Incidentally people do make jokes about Islam and Muslims and no one does s all about it they are not all demonstrating outside cinemas because the insults are often not obvious to anyone but the odd Muslim floating about and I walked out of ""Borat"" after 20 minutes for that and other reasons and got my money back. Apart from that it was simply unfunny and. yes I DID read the trailerFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 21 2012NILES CRANEFeaturedIf you like Family Guy like I do then youll love it.Or if youre a fan of the work of Seth McFarlane like I am youll love it.Its not for kids.And its more for fans of Frankie Boyle than Jack Dee. The audience laughed out loud at the screening many times.Cant remember a British Comedy doing that since.....cannot remember....FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 17 2012JackSprattFeaturedThe word banal comes to mind. The movie has funny moments but it certainly does tell people that drugs are great and the normal thing to do. Also jokes about Parkinsons arent witty theyre just mean and why does Hollywood always attack Christianity?FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 14 2012ricFeaturedLoved it. Go see if your a fan of family guy.If not then you might be a little disgusted amp; offended-look at reviews 3 star amp; under but heyyou cant please everyone.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 7 2012DavetFeaturedSomebody above said this film is thankfully not PC. Of course they are right its far from PC. I couldnt care less about the drugs personally but are we seeing a reemergence of racism in our cinema? Whilst Ted is not as bad in that respect as the appalling Baron-Cohen vehicle from earlier this year why do we need to put up with jokes in Ted such as theres an Asian family next door but at least they dont have a gong? Its not even funny. Having said that this film did have its moments. 1 star though because casual racism is not what i expect to see in a cinema in the 21st century.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 6 2012SuttonFeaturedThis is an enjoyable and bawdy comedy. There are some very funny moments and thankfully it is not PC. ItaEUR(tm)s an enjoyable way to spend an afternoon. If you are a fan of Family Guy then this film will probably appeal. The CGI is good and if you shut your eyes at times it is an unusual experience hearing aEUR~MegaEUR(tm) and aEUR~BrianaEUR(tm) deliver the lines. I also liked the Peter Griffin joke.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 5 2012scrumpyjackFeaturedA crisper running time (say 90 min) and more of the type of brilliant scenes that follow ""TEDDY RUX FUCKIN PIN"" then 4. as it stands supurb CGI aside not a lot else bar ""dont peek youll get kid cancer"" type ""jokes"" (Ohh my aching sides) and SOME decent sniggers. Pity still worth a watch but a little more decorum and it could have been the comedy of the year. Oh yes isnt the BBFCs ""15 rated"" policy on drugs along the lines they are not to be endorsed? EVERYONE seems to be having a great time on them with NO negative affects what so ever 7/10FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 5 2012SusanFeaturedWhoops Thats-- He I have some really wild dance moves. She So do people with Parkinsons.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 5 2012SusanFeaturedThere is a glorification of the drug culture here that is disturbing. I mean should we really be telling kids that this is normal and good behavior and the constant extreme language is just unnecessary. Im also tired of films that have little attacks on Christianity as well. If these ""jokes"" were made about Islam people would be demonstrating outside right now. The idea of a talking teddy is ok and there are some funny jokes but but mostly the movie really isnt that funny and is often childis and/or nasty.. Example He Im a really good dancer. She So are people with Parkinsons.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 4 2012MitchFeaturedTed was a stupid movie...it really wasnt funny...and that comes from a guy who likes Adam sandler movies and American dad...I went in not expecting much and I wasnt disappointed....one star...barely...FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 3 2012IanFeaturedOk lets get this out of the way before we start. As a comedy this isnt big and it isnt clever. It is funny in places very funny but sadly the very funny bits are too far apart. If you are easily offended dont go and see this because there are lots of drugs taken lots of swearing and probably too much Teddy Bear sex (yes you read that right). If you like South Park Family Guy and loved Team America then this is probably the film for you. If you dont then you will probably hate this. The bear is excellent and Wallbergs acting to an animated bear that must have been cgid in later is superb. Kunis is ok and looks very hot in her ""office work outfit"" but the real heart of the film is the buddy story between man and bear. The best bits are in the trailer and there are many in jokes about 80s movies and a number of surprising cameos. I liked it just expected to like it more. An ok 3 star film nothing more sadly.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 3 2012Roy BattyFeaturedTed isnt for everybody sure TRUTHTELLER but it certainly is more than your standard (and usually tame) gross-out comedy - from my point of view I didnt go into the cinema expecting to be blown away by the plot or have a life changing experience - the plot is merely a (fairly weak) vehicle for the jokes and to be honest the humour is really just a 15 certificate extension of Family GuyaEUR| but the point is that I did go in expecting a certain level (and standard) of comedy. My 4 stars were based on the fact that I enjoyed a film I was EXPECTING to be at a certain level - it might have been 5 stars but for the fact that some of the jokes dont quite hit the mark. That aside to give a film one star - not because you thought it was badly made or down to a poor plot or even not funny enough - but because it offended your own personal sensibilities and beliefs says more about your own judgement - seriously if you have a sensitive sense of humour dont buy a Jimmy Carr DVD if youre sensitive about religion dont buy a Richard Dawkins book and if youre sensitive about offensive movies dont go and see an offensive movie and then moan about how offended you were.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 3 2012salvatore contaldoFeaturedin my opinion the plot is linear and clear without major gaps or non-sense the idea behind this movie is great simple but working really well and the jokes are amazing if you like this kind of humour.

If you have an intellect and/or an IQ roughly equivalent to a rock then maybe you will laugh at the unfunny unwitty material that was apparently written by a ten-year-old on a bad day.

Why did they ever get made? Didnt anyone know how bad they were from the start? Then there is ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" which provokes wonderment pure and simple. How did it ever get made? Did the people who financed and created it know how magical and piercingly beautiful it would be? They couldnt have known at the outset. Benh Zeitlins debut feature evokes life in a surpassingly strange corner of Louisiana through the ecstatic spirit of a 6-year-old black girl named Hushpuppy. Theres no trace of calculation only artistic ambitions and hopes that have come to fruition in the years finest film thus far. Most of the action takes place in the Bathtub a tiny community of impoverished locals--black and white some descended from Cajun or Indian fishermen--in South Louisianas bayou country. Because the Bathtub lies outside the levee system it will overflow in an impending hurricane and Hushpuppy knows as well as everyone else that ramshackle homes and precious possessions will be swept away. ""Any day now the fabric of the universe is comin unraveled"" she declares. Hushpuppys mind is all aswirl with animist signs and ominous portents--consuming fire; another ""Iced Age""; the mythical beasts of the title derived from the extinct aurochs that threaten rampant destruction. She speaks in quasipoetic phrases that might seem impossibly pretentious if they werent so rich and original and if the child speaking them--a nonprofessional named Quvenzhane Wallis--werent so madly enchanting. (Hushpuppys father a passionate violent and grievously ill man named Wink is played by another astonishingly eloquent nonprofessional Dwight Henry. In fact the entire cast is nonprofessional.) ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" directed by Benh Zeitlin follows six-year-old Hushpuppy (Quvenzhane Wallis) as she deals with her fathers ailing health and an epic storm. Watch a clip from the film. Video Courtesy of Fox Searchlight. Language is key to the enchantment of the film as a whole. Not just the words which the director and Lucy Alibar adapted from Ms. Alibars stage play ""Juicy and Delicious"" but the stylized cinematic language of Ben Richardsons images as edited by Crockett Doob and Affonso Goncalves. This is a low-budget production that looks like a million dollars greatly multiplied. Fireworks flash and sparkle. Hands thrust into a stream come up with thrashing catfish. (Wink has built a boat for himself from an asthmatic outboard a truck body and 55-gallon drums lashed into service as pontoons.) In a floating crab shack and whorehouse called Elysian Fields dancers drift through a humid haze to the strains of Fats Wallers ""Until the Real Thing Comes Along."" And when the hurricane comes along its the visual equivalent of what Noah in ""The Green Pastures"" calls ""a complete storm"" a deluge that tests the communitys attachment to its precarious place and endangered way of life. ""Get in here"" a good-natured waitress at Elysian Fields tells Hushpuppy who in the midst of everything else has been searching for her dead mother. ""Lemme show you a magic trick."" The whole movie is a magic trick and part of the magic is that it can be seen in various ways. The setting provides a metaphorical divide between rich and poor ""Aint that ugly over there?"" Hushpuppy says of the industrial landscape on the other side of the levee. ""We got the prettiest place on earth."" (The divide is undermined when wily residents of the flood-beset Bathtub figure out a way to drain it more quickly than Mother Nature might have planned.) The film can equally be seen as an ethnographic project guided mainly by two white Americans Mr. Zeitlin and Ms. Alibar with an unquenchable interest in how people of a remote region live think speak and sing. The sound track is a treasure. Even the kitchen implements have an exotic allure. But the best way to see ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" is to sit back let its pleasures wash over you and forget at least for the duration of the experience about making distinctions between whats real--and shockingly harsh--in Hushpuppys life and whats boiling in her imagination. Scenes stay vivid long after the experience has ended Wink raging against the storm by shooting at it with his rifle; Hushpuppy tracing a record of her being like a cave girl scratching pictograms (""Once there was a Hushpuppy and she lived with her daddy in the Bathtub""); a boozy neighbor bottle to lips stepping out of his front door into deep water; those aurochses on the march; Hushpuppys shrill trills of joy and the slow burn of her comprehension as she sees her father where hed feared to be in a hospital bed plugged into the wall. At its core Mr. Zeitlins film is a tale of daughter and father struggling to survive. Wink is not the father that Hushpuppys vanished mother would have wanted him to be. He drinks and gives his little girl ample tastes too. He feeds her slops--""Share wit the dog"" he barks--and knocks her around in the course of loving and trying to protect her. There are no boundaries between rage and love in their life and one of the productions many mysteries is how a man with no dramatic training--Mr. Henry runs a bakery in the town where the movie was shot--could have delivered such a magnificent performance. For Winks daughter--the angel-faced fiercely focused girl that Quvenzhane Wallis plays with uncanny grace--he is the source of all wisdom as well as love. A psychologist might say that he holds her in his thrall by keeping her off balance with wildly unpredictable behavior but Hushpuppy knows only that she adores him and believes in him and will survive thanks to the lessons she has learned from him. Hers is an unconditional love and its not so far removed from what you may feel for this stirring and ultimately thrilling movie. ENLARGE Matthew McConaughey and Channing Tatum in Magic Mike Warner Bros. Pictures Matthew McConaughey and Channing Tatum star in ""Magic Mike"" a film that follows a male stripper as he teaches a younger performer the ropes. Watch a clip from the film. Video Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures. Magic Mike ""You dont need to talk"" an appreciative female tells Channing Tatums male stripper Magic Mike. ""Just look pretty."" He looks pretty indeed whether or not hes on stage in a tacky Tampa club doing spectacular gyrations in charmingly silly routines. Mr. Tatum whose talents have been the subject of debate also makes Mike genuinely affecting not to mention articulate within the bounds of a sketchy script. The process is called acting and the man in the title role of Steven Soderberghs flashy not-so-trashy entertainment does it so well that the debate should be officially ended. Mike isnt just a fancy dancer but a striver with dreams of becoming an entrepreneur and a mentor who takes an aimless kid Alex Pettyfers Adam under his wing and gets him a job at the club. (The kid who comes to be known as The Kid is a fictional version of Mr. Tatum during a brief period in his life.) Matthew McConaughey dominates every scene hes in as Dallas the clubs malign owner and exultantly preening onstage host. The film which the director shot handsomely on a tight schedule feels partly improvised looks like ""Cabaret"" stripped of the Weimar grit and Fosse wit and plays like ""Boogie Nights"" without the porn miasma. Its cheerfully raunchy and delivers the goods for fans of male beefcake though with more innocence along with some sadness than would appear at first blush. Thats not to say the drama goes much deeper than the skin on vivid display. In the department of emotional development ""Magic Mike"" turns the unlikely trick of disembodiment. ENLARGE Mark Wahlberg and the title character voiced by Seth MacFarlane in Ted Universal Studios Mark Wahlberg Mila Kunis and Seth MacFarlane star in MacFarlanes first feature-length comedy ""Ted"" about what happens when a boy and his stuffed bear grow up. Watch a clip from the film. Video Courtesy of Universal Pictures. Ted Everyone admires economies of scale but an economy of scale might have been the saving grace of Seth MacFarlanes debut feature. ""Ted"" is often hilarious sometimes sweet and in the spirit of ""Family Guy"" consistently raunchy. Yet its seriously overextended and as the premise wears ever thinner frantically overproduced. (The director worked from a script credited to him Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild.) As you probably know by now--the movies marketing campaign has been intense--Mark Wahlberg is John Bennett an amiable guy though in the spirit of Peter Griffin not super-bright. Ted an animated creature voiced by Mr. MacFarlane is the potty-mouthed and compulsively womanizing teddy bear who has been Johns best buddy since childhood. Theirs is a beautiful romance albeit a turbulent one threatened only by Johns love for Lori Collins (Mila Kunis) a beautiful human whos been waiting impatiently for John to grow up and put aside the childish thing that continues to rule his life. Ms. Kunis makes a strong case for intraspecies relationships though she lacks the sparkle of some previous performances and its great fun to watch John and Ted in the deliciously casual course of their dailiness or at one startling flash point in the agony of duking it out. Yet everything goes on too long--Teds carousing Loris watchful waiting Johns wistful indecision. The movie started to lose me around the time of a silly plot turn involving Norah Jones then lost me completely during an interminable car chase--car chases being the standard studio solution for script problems--followed by an out-of-scale sequence at Fenway Park. Ted doesnt age but ""Ted"" does. People Like Us Going on too long seems to be the disease of the week; its certainly what brings this movie down though the going on here stems from a surfeit of implausible plot that suffocates the main characters and the excellent actors who play them. ""People Like Us"" is a debut feature by Alex Kurtzman; he wrote the script with Roberto Orci and Jody Lambert. Although the trailer lays the whole thing out in unseemly detail Ill be more circumspect and say only that Chris Pines Sam a salesman with suddenly desperate financial problems discovers family secrets after the death of his estranged father who has left a bundle of cash to be given to someone Sam has never heard of. Mr. Kurtzman is good with actors and the film begins promisingly with Mr. Pines portrait of a fast-talking man on the edge. Sam talks so fast that I wondered if hed fall victim to what Ive begun to consider since the frenzied debut of ""The Newsroom"" as the Aaron Sorkin syndrome. No need to worry about that though; he slows down when the movie slows to a crawl. The hitherto unknown someone played with verve and touching simplicity by Elizabeth Banks is Frankie a single mother and a recovering alcoholic who tends bar at a luxury hotel. (In this script glib juxtapositions pass for dilemmas.) It seems ridiculous to dance around plot details when the movie allows the audience to get ahead of the story and to stay there as events laboriously unfold. Still all youll learn here is that Sam by misrepresenting himself to Frankie from the start sustains a state of suspense that is not only unsustainable but manifestly nonsensical. Two actors are appealing in smaller roles Michael Hall DAddario as Frankies young son and Olivia Wilde as Hannah Sams girlfriend. The wonderful Michelle Pfeiffer is not so wonderfully stuck with playing Lillian Sams mother. To lend Lillian gravitas the movie equips her with glasses and a heart condition.

No the truly strange thing is that it took Seth MacFarlane this long to make a movie in the first place. Hes a massively prolific writer/director and opportunities had to have abounded so what was he waiting on? Perhaps for the CGI to come along wherein he could make a teddy bear punch Mark Wahlberg in the face? If so kudos must be awarded MacFarlane is our most patient of artists a veritable monk of mise en place. The year is 1985. We find ourselves in a suburb outside of Boston and little John Bennett is an outcast. Hes unloved by his child peers cast to the wolves without a friend in the world. One Christmas he wishes his teddy bear would come to life so hed have a best bud forever. This transpires and Ted is born As you can imagine it takes the world by storm celebrity interviews and TMZ stories follow. However fast-forwarding a couple of decades the tumult has died down a bit and Ted (voiced by MacFarlane) and John (Mark Wahlberg) are just normal roomies looking to get high. John has a girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) who is largely understanding of their bond though shed like for John to show a bit more drive. Sister weve all been there. Yes its fair to say the plot construct is typical rom-com fodder though the continual visual of Ted tends to make even the ""normal domestic squabble"" routine feel oddly fresh. You sit in the theater listening to all sides of the argument and then catch yourself - youve been hearing out a CGI bear. That will cause you to question much about your reality potentially inspiring a laugh if youre the introspective sort. Still could ""Ted"" actually be about something broader? Is there some larger philosophical theme the satire is gently hinting at? It would be a fair to say America as a culture has a tough time growing up. We play video games into our 50s were having kids later and later marriage can wait and were crashing with the rents as long as humanly possible. So you could make the perfectly sensible argument that Ted is an apt metaphor for our times. We all hold on to childhood a little too long and our society encourages this. Were doted upon by enablers. Age is a state a mind youre as young as you feel seize the day just do it and enjoy all the Locos Tacos you can stuff down your gullet. Why could it be that ""Ted"" is just the movie we need to break us out of our stupor? Finally a rousing call to action against the dying of the light? Nah Im only messing with you. But see? This is the precise method ""Ted"" utilizes for its entire 106-minute running time Just when you think you know perfectly well how the scene is going to go just when you could actually write the next line of dialogue ""Ted"" yanks out the rug with a low-class fart joke. Or a highbrow art joke. Or a blatantly racist moment juxtaposed against Ryan Reynolds showing up apropos of nothing. Brandon Routh and Justin Beiber will be made fun of and Patrick Stewart provides a rollicking voice-over. None of it makes any sense but everyone is in on the joke. Seth MacFarlane espouses a particular type of comedy a random homage-y sort of spectacle that confounds as much as it delights. Occasionally the joke is that theres not a joke sometimes its a ""Flash Gordon"" reference and every so often its a well-placed F-bomb. I wouldnt claim that any of it makes any sense or that its not all an exercise in acquired tastes but it made me laugh throughout. As thats the intended job of comedy I tip my cap in appreciation and say ""Good game."" Before ""Ted"" hits the closing epilogue youll get to see a pitch-perfect reenactment of an iconic scene from ""Airpane."" Youll see comedy all-stars pass the ball sans ego in pursuit of laughs. ""Ted"" pulls off the same thing that ""Castaway"" managed with Wilson making you care for an object your logic tells you is simply not real. It wont matter youll feel the warmth and camaraderie of a Bostonite and his little sentient bear. Or maybe you wont and youll hate this. Its hard to tell which way is up in ""Ted"" but at some point for me the laughs won out over the logic.

Universal Pictures/Tippett Studio hide caption toggle caption Universal Pictures/Tippett Studio Ted Director Seth McFarlane Genre Comedy Running Time 106 minutes Rated R for crude and sexual content pervasive language and some drug use With Mark Wahlberg Mila Kunis Seth MacFarlane Joel McHale Giovanni Ribisi Watch Clips From Ted - Beer? Beer? Credit Universal Pictures From Ted- White Trash Name White Trash Name Credit Universal Pictures From Ted - Double Date Double Date Credit Universal Pictures Seth MacFarlane is known mostly for creating writing and directing the animated TV show Family Guy. In the show he also voices Peter and Stewie Griffin and their dog Brian. With his new movie Ted he has moved to the big screen for the first time again creating writing and directing. And though its a live-action picture he has again voiced one of the characters -- the titular teddy bear whom I tried to resist but couldnt. Really I did try. The opening bit struck me as too cute by half. The loneliest kid on his block 8-year-old Johnny gets a big teddy bear as a Christmas present one that talks when you squeeze it. ""I love you"" it says in a squeaky little voice. And as hes falling asleep that night Johnny makes a wish on a falling star -- ""I wish you could really talk to me"" he pleads -- and is more than a little startled when the wish comes true. Teddy comes to life startles the parents briefly makes headlines -- and then as happens with most instant celebrities the world loses interest. Johnny grows older; Ted does too; their voices deepen and we catch up with them 27 years later. Johnny is now 35 with a job an apartment a girlfriend and ... a teddy bear. Now at this point in the picture Im still not buying in. John played pleasantly by Mark Wahlberg with his own Boston accent seems entirely real. Mila Kunis is Lori also real and tolerant beyond words. And I guess Ted is animated persuasively but Ive still got Mel Gibsons The Beaver rattling around in my head and despite this movies boozing bromance profanity and bong hits its all striking me as a little precious. Then Lori insists that she and John need a little space -- and the practicalities of that are what finally won me over. Ted obviously needs a job. Which means he needs to put on a tie -- ""You look dapper"" Johnny assures him unconvincingly -- and go out in the world. And out in the world he starts to -- I dunno -- actually exist. i When Johnnys girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) tires of Teds constant presence around the house Ted gets a job -- which is when the comedy catches fire. Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Universal Pictures When Johnnys girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) tires of Teds constant presence around the house Ted gets a job -- which is when the comedy catches fire. Universal Pictures Once you stop fighting him Seth MacFarlane makes Ted really funny whether romancing a trampy checkout girl at the supermarket carousing with hookers getting into a knock-down-drag-out brawl with Johnny over an insult downing shots with Flash Gordon (which would take too long to explain). Its idiotic but not any more so than say The Hangovers wrong-gone bachelor party. And at heart its the same story about that transition point where overgrown kids have to finally grow up but get sidetracked by one companion -- a boorish coarse consistently inappropriate fuzzball who makes the growing up difficult. Ted is profane enough that its not a movie real kids should be allowed anywhere near. But its also a date movie and one that MacFarlane has somehow made safe for arrested-development types who wouldnt be caught dead at a date movie -- let alone one about a girl a guy and a teddy bear.

"Tired old toy Ted is yet another movie about Peter Pan syndrome |       NJ.com comments Tired old toy Ted is yet another movie about Peter Pan syndrome Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on June 29 2012 at 838 AM View/Post Comments Universal PicturesJohn (Mark Wahlberg) right and his friend Ted (Seth MacFarlane). When John Bennett was 8 he got a teddy bear for Christmas -- and wished (oh how he wished) that his toy could be real and that they could be friends forever and ever. Pretty cute when he was 8. Not so cute when it came true. And pretty creepy more than 25 years later as John has grown up into someone who hasnt really grown up and is still best pals with his real-life (and by now pretty foul-mouthed) talking toy. Its a pretty twisted idea for a movie -- really only half a step away from a mad Mel Gibson yakking to a furry puppet in ""The Beaver."" And if anyone is going to twist the idea further it should be Seth MacFarlane. So why is ""Ted"" so tame? It has plenty of drug jokes kinky sex racist gags showbiz putdowns and everything else MacFarlane fans have gotten used to on his TV cartoons particularly ""Family Guy."" Plus with an R rating MacFarlane can go further than even the Fox network will let him. Yet he never quite pushes things here. When the chance arises for belly laughs he settles for smiles. The problem is the central gag is that John is a teenager who wont grow up. Hed rather smoke dope and watch junk TV then actually do something. His incredibly hot girlfriend meanwhile is getting tired of waiting and wants him to start acting like an adult. Like yesterday. But weve already seen this plot in perhaps a dozen movies since ""Knocked Up."" Whats new? Nothing except the talking teddy bear -- which is practically an afterthought. Really sitting there on the couch doing bong hits he might as well be Seth Rogen. In fact he kind of looks like Seth Rogen. Hes voiced though -- not too impressively -- by MacFarlane. Mark Wahlberg looking like hes enjoying the comedy change-up is John; Mila Kunis underused (as shes been in just about everything except ""Black Swan"") is the long-suffering girlfriend. There are a couple of good sequences such as a flashback to the dance club where Wahlberg and Kunis met (although the gag feels stolen from ""Airplane""). The soundtrack is charmingly deliberately corny and theres a druggy out-of-control party that starts off well -- until the scene itself gets out of control. Theres also a great deadpan appearance by Patrick Warburton as one of Wahlbergs particularly perverse co-workers and one or two witty celebrity cameos. But other characters go nowhere (the film feels as if entire scenes were cut at the last minute). A full-out fight between Ted and John is just pointless destruction. And the films third act -- which clumsily shoehorns in some peril and a chase scene -- is nothing but forced. The idea of a toy that comes to life -- and then wont go away -- isnt a bad one. Too bad that ""Ted"" manages to overstay its welcome without ever really coming to life itself. Ratings note The film contains drug and alcohol abuse strong language sexual references nudity and violence. Ted (R) Universal (106 min.) Directed by Seth MacFarlane. With Mark Wahlberg Mila Kunis.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 29 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Saturday Jun. 30 2012 323PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Seth MacFarlane Written by Seth McFarlane et al Starring Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis Classification R Genre comedy Year 2012 Country USA Language English As unabashedly idiotic movie comedies go Ted goes fairly well. The feature directorial debut of Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane stars Mark Wahlberg as a man child whose best friend is a talking teddy bear (voiced by MacFarlane). And while this might seem like the premise of something precious and sensitive like Lars and the Real Girl Ted runs yelling in the opposite direction. Its rude crude lewd and often funny. In other words its a lot like MacFarlanes animated show transferred to the big screen in a live-action story. Screen grab from the online trailer for the film ""Ted"" starring Mark Wahlberg Mila Kunis and a talking teddy bear Movies Ted The official trailer Mark Wahlberg reverting to his homegrown Boston Southie accent plays John Bennett who we learn in the long plummy-voiced introductory narration was a little boy with no friends at all. When he wished for his teddy bear Ted to come alive his wish came true.And not just in that cutesy metaphorical Puff the Magic Dragon way. Back in the 1980s Ted became a celebrity phenomenon (we see him bantering with Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show) but he has since slid back into obscurity. John now 35 has an underling job at a car rental agency and lives with the former-child-star bear in a crummy apartment in an emotionally arrested bromance. They smoke a lot of weed together and watch old movies. Somewhat improbably John also has a hot girlfriend (Mila Kunis) who after four years of patient waiting decides to force the issue Its her or the teddy bear.Followers of MacFarlanes show will recognize many of the tropes here (MacFarlanes co-writers Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild are both from the Family Guy series). There are the flashback or digression scenes that turn bizarre Lori recalls her first meeting with John as an embarrassing nightclub accident where he was attempting to break dance and smacked her on the head. He recalls it as a combination of An Officer and a Gentleman and Saturday Night Fever.Scenes in which Wahlberg sits around getting high and riffing with the ever-inappropriate bear are the movies highlights. Wahlbergs childlike outbursts are winning and the bears Triumph the Insult Dog-style is fairly amusing as well.That said MacFarlanes formula begins to feel a bit relentless a search-and-destroy campaign for the audiences weak spots. Regular verbal shocks are followed by knowing pop culture references at rapid speed with the idea of shaking laughs out of the audience. The shock jokes are deliberately excessive - anti-Semitism homophobia bullied children rape Lou Gehrigs Disease and ""kid cancer"" are a few of the targets - though MacFarlane has the double defence of mocking both the ignorant as well as the politically correct. The pop culture references from Brandon Rouths Superman to Adam Sandlers Jack and Jill are generally spot-on. And when actor Sam Jones star of the ridiculous 1980 movie Flash Gordon appears at Teds the party is as outrageous as anything in The Hangover.Teds glaring weakness is a last-act thriller subplot designed to pad out the running time to feature length (Ted was originally conceived of as a TV series and might work best in half-hour bites). Giovanni Ribisi pops up as a celebrity stalker with a pudgy sociopathic son (Aedin Mincks) to kidnap Ted. Even in a mean movie the sequence feels needlessly unpleasant and worse dull and sentimental. Among many offensive things in life there are few as discomfiting as a satirist who drops his guard and shows his sloppy side.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A grown man tries to separate from his magically talking teddy bear. BOTTOM LINE Outrageously vulgar and very funny with an unexpected bonus A real beating heart. CAST Mark Wahlberg Mila Kunis Seth McFarlane LENGTH 146 The story of a grown man still attached to his magically talking teddy bear ""Ted"" is a throwback to high-concept charmers like ""Big"" and ""Splash"" only with more profanity and bowel-movement jokes (and without Tom Hanks). Its frequently very funny as you might expect from its writer director and co-star Seth MacFarlane creator of Foxs ""Family Guy."" Whats unexpected is that underneath the matted fur of the movies foul-mouthed bear beats a very real heart. Mark Wahlberg plays John Bennett an amiable Boston bozo who as a child wished his toy bear Ted to life. That event made the news (""Look what Jesus did"" screams a Southern televangelist) and turned the bear into a celebrity but nearly 30 years later John and Ted (voiced with some genuine emotion by MacFarlane) remain the best of friends clutching each other during the night and smoking bongs during the day. Meanwhile Johns longtime girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) waits patiently for a proposal. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Who was the Sons of Anarchy Homeless Woman? The banter between Wahlberg and MacFarlane is hilarious -- theyre like a low-class Abbott and Costello -- if a little familiar after years of Judd Apatow comedies. But MacFarlanes first feature film also avoids some genre pitfalls. Lori isnt a nagging killjoy; Ted is a real character not just a symbol; and John seems genuinely torn between the two. This may sound silly but the two humans and one bear make a pretty convincing dramatic triangle. The drawbacks are a throwaway plot involving a bear-napper (Giovanni Ribisi) and way too many 1980s references for one movie (in addition to an appearance by Sam Jones of ""Flash Gordon"" fame there are jokes about Frankie Munoz Tiffany ""Top Gun"" and other memes). Still any comedy that makes you actually feel something for a bear with a hooker habit has something going for it. PLOT A grown man tries to separate from his magically talking teddy bear.

(AP Photo/Universal Pictures) Ted Ted snaps when TV idea is stretched for big screen BY JOE HOLLEMAN  jhollemanpost-dispatch.com gt; 314-340-8254 Joe Holleman Jun 29 2012 (...) Photo Credit Universal Pictures Mark Wahlberg right with the character Ted voiced by Seth MacFarlane in a scene from ""Ted."" (AP Photo/Universal Pictures) You might leave ""Ted"" wondering where it all went wrong.How could Seth MacFarlane the creative force behind the hilarious TV show ""Family Guy"" put Mark Wahlberg Mila Kunis and a talented supporting cast in a movie and miss so badly?But the real question is why anyone thought it would go right. How many times will we assume that an idea that works for a TV show will still perform after it has been stretched miles beyond its breaking point? ""Ted"" does not only break before it ends. It snaps back so violently that it very well may knock out of your mind any recollection that the movie is fairly entertaining for about 30 minutes.The story begins with a lonely boy growing up near Boston friendless except for a teddy bear he gets for Christmas. That night he wishes the bear would come alive so they could be buddies forever. Sure enough it happens.Fast forward to present time and grown-up John (Wahlberg) has a job and a steady gal Lori (Kunis). Ted (voiced by MacFarlane) lives with the couple and the two buddies spend their time drinking beer smoking pot and watching sports. Lori endures but wishes John would finally do something with his life. Problems inevitably develop. Kunis is hit on by her boss (Joel McHale) she gives John an ultimatum and a creepy father (Giovanni Ribisi) wants to kidnap Ted to give to his own lonely son.But none of that matters. Not a bit. The plot is simply a shaky frame on which to hang drug and sex jokes and numerous pop-culture references. MacFarlane obviously is counting on re-creating the bawdy energy of ""Family Guy"" but also trying to elevate the impact by using skilled live actors.Are there moments of quality and hilarity? Sure.Wahlbergs underrated versatility mixes well with Kunis comedic sense and comeliness. That mix alone carries the film for a bit. A running gag with Patrick Warburton and Ryan Reynolds in a cameo brings laughs and MacFarlane scores some points with ""Family Guy""-like gags of crudeness and political incorrectness. But as is often the case when television shows are turned into full-length films youll find yourself longing for a remote control so you can surf away to another show.TedOne and a half stars out of four Rating R Run time 140 Content Drug use language sexual situations and brief nudity Joe Hollemans ""Life Sherpa"" column appears every Sunday in Everyday.

E.T. phone ""Family Guy."" Maybe the magical little alien wouldnt have been so adorable if he had hung around for 28 years trading raunchy remarks with Elliott while watching too much TV and smoking weed. But he would have been funny. Yet the surprise of ""Ted"" is that it goes for honest Spielbergian wonder too and even earns some tears. Though youll be able to say that you were merely crying with laughter at the filthy jokes. The ridiculously funny outlandish and inventive first film directed by ""Family Guy"" creator Seth MacFarlane who also co-wrote the screenplay begins much like ""E.T."" (and ""Big""). After a lonely little Boston boy wishes his teddy bear were real it starts walking and talking. Cute idea but MacFarlane advances it by imagining the bear as a celebrity who first appears on Johnny Carson -- then becomes just another forgotten expersonality jaded by minor fame. Ted laments he might as well have made his name for being on ""Diffrent Strokes."" As years go by the bear (voiced by MacFarlane) is content to hang out with his buddy John (Mark Wahlberg) making wisecracks but Johns girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) says the plush toy has got to move on or she will. So Ted has to get his own apartment put on a suit for a job interview (""I look like Snuggles accountant"" he complains) and get a job at a grocery store. Where he nails a cashier. I expected ""Ted"" to be a one-joke movie but its got ideas spilling out of its seams. Its a smoothly designed rom-com in addition to being a parody of same and for a while its even bizarrely effective as a thriller. The banter between man and bear is nearly as sharp as the script of ""Superbad."" ""Ted"" would work fine even if the stuffed animal were a human roommate. As it is the bear is such a believable character (thanks in part to brilliant CGI and credit MacFarlane with deploying familiar technology with such an innovative spirit) that the scene when Ted beats up John isnt really funny. Instead its a little heartbreaking You hate to see such good friends hurting each other. Ted and John are like many a pair of buds who when seen from a female perspective bring out the child in each other. Plus Lori is jealous at being left out of their shtick. She is frustrated when they have to explain a joke to her and seethes when she finds out Johns ringtone for her calls is the Darth Vader theme. A gift for comedy is to men what a gift for style is to women something they wish the opposite sex had a lot more of. And sometimes two guys shared adoration for a bad movie can be as powerful as any romance. The movie runs short of imagination in the last 10 minutes but until then its nearly perfect. Typically deft is a scene in which John trying to win Lori back during her date with her wealthy but sleazy boss (the superb ""Community"" star Joel McHale) does something that is not only a big funny gesture but is also sweet and yet gives Ted ample opportunities for dirty jokes. Even better The boss may have a heart too. He admits he slipped into jerk mode in high school and got stuck there. I dont know what MacFarlane can do to top this movie. Maybe Ted joins a frat with Paddington Fozzie and Winnie the Pooh? Winnies honey pot will run dry as usual but this time Ted could introduce him to his bong.

Starring Mila Kunis Mark Wahlberg Seth MacFarlane Giovanni Ribisi Joel McHale Director Seth MacFarlane Release Opened Jun 29 2012  Editorial Review A buzz kill with a stuffed bearBy Ann HornadayFriday June 29 2012If youve seen the trailers for ""Ted"" youre hip to its high-concept premise A little boy named Johnny Bennett gets a cuddly teddy bear for Christmas and after making a wish the bear begins to talk; 20 years later Johnny (Mark Wahlberg) and Ted (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) live together as roomies arrested adolescents getting high watching ""SpongeBob"" and generally avoiding the bothersome business of growing up. Making his live-action directorial debut MacFarlane the genial wisenheimer behind the animated television series ""Family Guy"" has created a universe based largely on the same humor of that show making ""Ted"" a probable hit with those viewers. Theres no denying the subversive jolt of witnessing a sweet-looking stuffed animal sucking down bong hits drinking swearing a blue streak and making lascivious moves when he spots an attractive woman he wants to date. But eventually MacFarlanes formula -- consisting of filthy ethnically offensive jokes scatological humor tacky pop culture references and random cameos -- begins to wear thin. (At last count there were two Sept. 11 one-liners in ""Ted"" one zinger involving rape and lazy gay jokes too numerous to track.) And as Johnnys relationship with his patient girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) begins to strain what began as a promising if unhinged experiment in suspending disbelief starts to feel like ""You Me and Dupree"" for plushies. Its not that there arent laughs in ""Ted"" because there are plenty usually earned by way of throwaway lines having to do with has-been (or soon-to-be) celebrities or in one of the films most memorable scenes when the always-game Wahlberg delivers a motor-mouthed list of girls names on a pot-fueled dare. (""Flash Gordon"" fans will also receive an Easter basket full of goodies.) Later he participates in perhaps the most inspired hotel-room fistfight ever choreographed for stage or screen. The problem is that MacFarlanes sneering jokey humor and wearyingly coarse toy character cant sustain interest beyond that initial outrageous guffaw. And a third-act plot twist feels like padding rather than motivated by genuine narrative -- wait I just remembered this is a review of a movie about a talking teddy bear. Come to think of it ""Ted"" may be best enjoyed while enjoying the same mind-altering substances its protagonists ingest in such copious doses. Once the novelty wears off though so does the buzz.Contains crude and sexual content pervasive profanity and some drug use.

When his hapless roommate/owner (Mark Wahlberg) comes home with his disapproving girlfriend (Mila Kunis) surprising Ted partway through an especially disgusting party game with his female guests the plush ursine delivers his movie review in the New England growl familiar to viewers of TVs ""Family Guy"" ""Sandler plays both a girl and a dude. It was unbearable Unwatchable""Indeed with ""Ted"" MacFarlane has thrown down the comedy gauntlet most prominently before Sandler but also before others we could name You want to make a raunchy hard-R farce homeboy? Complete with a ludicrous premise Boston-centric sports gags random washed-up celebrity cameos spoofs of several different kinds of more serious movies an irrelevant third-act action sequence and a sentimental resolution? Step aside and see how its done my man.I wont pretend even for a second that ""Ted"" which marks the first foray into feature film for MacFarlane -- creator of ""Family Guy"" ""American Dad"" and ""The Cleveland Show"" -- doesnt indulge in cheap or vulgar gags. It positively revels in them from a resentful Ted telling a prospective employer in intimate detail exactly how he had sex with the guys wife to Giovanni Ribisi playing a creepy stalkerish guy whose secret vice is performing hoochie-coo Madonna-style dance numbers to the Tiffany video ""I Think Were Alone Now.""But in a universe of Hollywood comedies that seem determined to insult the audience and pander to the basest form of post-adolescent fantasy ""Ted"" feels almost sophisticated. Its funniest gags are verbal or conceptual it winks at the audience without betraying its essentially likable characters and it pulls a startlingly high proportion of laughs without ever making fun of fat women or gay people or going deep into toilet humor. (OK there is that one prostitute in the Truth or Dare scene who ... never mind.) Sure this isnt my usual Pick of the Week fare and this week also offers several outstanding upscale alternatives including ""Take This Waltz"" ""Magic Mike"" and ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" all of which Ive covered or will cover. But dammit all the healthcare law survived the freakin Supreme Court and its time to celebrate with a blissfully idiotic summer comedy dont you think?As for Mark Wahlberg in the so-called starring role of John Bennett a formerly lonely child whose wish for his stuffed companion to come alive was miraculously granted one Christmas I can safely say I never thought Id see him playing the straight-man sidekick to an animatronic teddy bear. But as he was in the underappreciated cop comedy ""The Other Guys"" Wahlberg is golden as a hapless befuddled dude whose inability to grow up takes physical form as the foulmouthed wisecracking plush toy who sits next to him on the sofa doing bong hits. (Ted has purchased a blend of weed from his dealer called ""Mind Rape"" suggesting that it sounds less sinister than the one called ""This Is Permanent."") Stoned nearly all the time and barely getting by at a grade-C rental-car agency John reacts to ordinary events with a wild-eyed intensity. When a co-worker shows up with a black eye John asks him whether he belongs to ""one of those you know secret gay beat-up clubs."" (The answer in fact is not entirely clear.) You Might Also Like Do you really want me to explain how Johns teddy bear comes to life in the first place? It simply happens thats all and MacFarlane rides it as far as it can possibly go. As Patrick Stewarts mellifluous opening narration informs us magic has not entirely vanished from the world. In what presumably must be a coincidence the plot of ""Ted"" is bizarrely similar to that of Sandlers painful recent flop ""Thats My Boy"" in that the protagonist has survived a period of 80s celebrity before falling on leaner times. Little Johns Christmas miracle was a big media story way back when but now Ted like John is an adult (albeit one confined to the same cuddly genital-free body) whom people sometimes recognize on the Boston streets Oh hey there goes that live teddy-bear guy I used to love him Where Sandler calls upon Vanilla Ice perhaps the funniest aspect of ""Thats My Boy"" MacFarlane goes much deeper sending John and Ted into a cocaine-fueled party night with Sam J. Jones once the blond-hunk star of the 1980 camp classic ""Flash Gordon.""MacFarlane gets in a few jabs at ""Fight Club"" as already mentioned along with an action climax staged at Fenway Park that shamelessly mocks ""The Town"" Ben Afflecks overpraised and shticky Bahstan crime drama. Most of his satire however is directed at the tired dude-vs.-chick comedy formula about the man-child who cant grow up and the long-suffering unbelievably cute girlfriend (in this case Kunis professional-minded Lori) who yearns to bend his will into putting a ring on it. I guess when your lame boyfriends bromantic roommate is actually a teddy bear instead of Ryan Reynolds or whomever the problem has reached a new level. (I dont bring up Ryan Reynolds completely at random Hes actually in this movie although he never speaks and so is Norah Jones who does telling Ted that hes pretty good in bed for a guy with no dick.) But heres the real summer miracle of ""Ted"" Through all the dirty jokes and stoner humor and guessing games involving impressively long litanies of possible names for trashy Boston girlfriends -""Wait"" says John to Ted ""is it one of those names with Lynn after it?"" -- MacFarlane never loses touch with the basics. John and Ted really are best friends forever even if theyve gotten stuck in a Mind Rape-smokin early-midlife rut and Lori really does love John for who he is teddy bear and all. Beneath the raunchy drugged-out anarchy of ""Ted"" lies a fundamental sweetness and good nature and MacFarlane even argues against the false dichotomy of those battle-of-the-sexes comedies. You can become a real grownup man (or woman) without wearing a suit or getting a 300 douchebag haircut and without letting go of the passion and wonder of childhood. In fact the very best grownups never do. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

That is until Lori (Mila Kunis) the tolerant and loving girlfriend who John realizes is too good for him puts her foot down insisting John grow up and be a man if theyre to stay together.

Joel McHale is very funny as as Loris sleazy boss and Giovanni Ribisi is creepily comical as a nefarious guy who kidnaps Ted ostensibly for his strange little boy.This bromance with rapid-fire quips however is undermined by unoriginal scenarios and a long drawn-out chase scene. The crass gleefully offensive humor doesnt always hit its mark the plot is predictable and the overused Flash Gordon references grow silly and tiresome.Then just when Ted seems about to get truly annoying theres a hilarious celebrity cameo to liven things up or a truly clever pop culture reference that puts it all back in the plus column. Its no teddy bears picnic but the moments of inspired humor and the chemistry between a very funny Wahlberg and his potty-mouthed bear is better than most A-list Hollywood pairings.

"Ted from Family Guy-creator Seth MacFarlane reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Ted Theres a Cruel Edge to Seth MacFarlanes Comedy Ted Theres a Cruel Edge to Seth MacFarlanes Comedy Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 28 2012 733 PM Ted Seth MacFarlane is not terribly interested in emotional epiphanies. By David Haglund John (Mark Wahlberg) hangs out with his best friend Ted (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) inTed Photograph courtesy Universal Pictures/Tippett Studio. Seth MacFarlane is one of the most popular and least influential voices in American comedy. Thanks to his animated hit on Fox Family Guy--as well as a spin-off The Cleveland Show and another cartoon comedy American Dad--he is ""the highest-paid writer-producer in television history."" And yet to quote another American comic he dont get no respect. Family Guy is widely derided as a Simpsons rip-off and the South Park guys among others have openly and repeatedly dismissed MacFarlane and his work. (Both their show and his often get attacked by the censors so people frequently lump them together. Matt and Trey are not happy about this.) David Haglund David Haglund is the literary editor of NewYorker.com. Now MacFarlanes branched out from his insular Sunday-night-on-Fox empire and made a movie Ted starring Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis (who does one of the main voices on Family Guy). It also stars MacFarlane himself--or rather his voice which he lends to the movies title character a teddy bear brought to life when a young boy makes a wish. That young boy is the Wahlberg character John Bennett who grew up just outside Boston in the 1980s. John makes his wish at Christmas that ""special time of year"" a comically old-fashioned narrator tells us when little boys and girls all around New England ""beat up the Jewish kids."" That punchline is the first indication (apart from the opening credits) that this is indeed a Seth MacFarlane comedy. Its not the last Ted we soon learn is one of the pint-sized balls of pure id that populate his work. Ted was briefly famous when the world learned of his existence--we even see him on Carson where Ted says Ed McMahon kept muttering anti-Semitic remarks thinking that he was Alf (and that Alf was Jewish). But he has long since faded into obscurity living in the Back Bay with his best friend John who works at a car rental place where all hes got to do in the words of his boss ""is not fuck up."" Advertisement He does of course John has a penchant for ditching work so he can do bong hits with Ted and watch the 1980 live-action film version of Flash Gordon. These man-child habits have begun to tax the patience of his girlfriend Lori played by Kunis who works at a PR firm with several similarly attractive and well-dressed young women and a sleazy male supervisor played by Joel McHale. Thus are the familiar rom-com parameters established John is an immature dude with a heart of gold who must outgrow his loutish friend--who happens to be plush--and hold onto his gorgeous and super put-together girlfriend keeping her from the clutches of a more successful but obviously evil rival. In many ways Ted hews to this tired outline. John kicks Ted out and after an incident at a party decides they cant be friends at all. Kunis meanwhile who helped carry Forgetting Sarah Marshall and was charismatic and sexy in Black Swan is wasted here getting no real story of her own Lori wants a ring and shes settled on John. Her resolution is at least made slightly more plausible by Johns incarnation in the form of Mark Wahlberg; dim-witted and unambitious he may be but the man can certainly fill out a car-rental employee uniform. And Wahlberg is charming as always in what is arguably his first straightforwardly comic leading role (not counting The Happening). He also does a perfectly natural Boston accent an essential skill given how heavily MacFarlane a Connecticut native relies on local color. Ted even has a big scene at the Hatch Shell--with an odd extended cameo by Norah Jones--and like Ben Afflecks The Town a climactic showdown at Fenway Park. A rom-com with a climactic showdown at Fenway Park? Why yes. MacFarlane is not terribly interested in emotional epiphanies. Instead he gives us a second villain a disturbed mustachioed man (Giovanni Ribisi) who has been obsessed with Ted since childhood and who late in the film kidnaps the bear and gives him to his equally troubled son to play with. We shift into action-comedy mode and any question of the bear being abandoned is dropped completely. There are some laughs along the way but this problem with story is typical of MacFarlane. (Many of Family Guys jokes are dropped into random cutaways from the main action.) Also typical the sour mean-spiritedness at the heart of so much of his humor. The Jewish jokes cited above work because theyre really jokes about anti-Semitism. But when an Asian man bursts through the wall at a party brandishing a duck and a meat cleaver and says things like ""This is my home long time"" and ""I try to make duck dinner"" its not a joke about racism. Its just racism. (Earlier Ted had noted that his new neighbors were an ""Asian family but they dont have a gong or nothing so its not that bad."") Similarly a bunch of gay-panic jokes throughout the film--the Ribisi villain is unsurprisingly played as effeminate--undermine the fun of an obviously homoerotic fantasy John has about Sam Jones Flash Gordon. (And no MacFarlane doesnt get a pass just because hes an outspoken advocate for equal marriage rights.) Theres a cruel edge to so much of MacFarlanes comedy--the quintessential MacFarlane joke may be a punch in the face. Of which we get many in Ted The movies version of the meet-cute comes when John accidentally decks Lori on a dance floor and the show-stopping set piece is a knock-down drag-out between John and Ted in a hotel room. The latter scene bears more than a passing resemblance to the naked fight from Borat--but where the Sacha Baron-Cohen bit was done with almost unimaginable comic gusto the MacFarlane equivalent relies on really good CGI. It is funny to watch a teddy bear wail on Mark Wahlberg. But afterward I mostly felt beat up. Correction July 2 2012 This article originally referred to Seth MacFarlane as a native of Rhode Island. He was born and raised in Connecticut. (Return to corrected sentence.) Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Photo Tippett Studio Universal Pictures Ted review It bears some revolting laughs 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Ted Comedy. Directed and written by Seth MacFarlane. Starring Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis. (R. 106 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Which is weirder a talking teddy bear huffing a bong or a talking teddy bear wildly humping a grocery checkout girl on a pile of fresh produce? Neither. Its the brutal bugged-out fight scene in the later minutes of ""Ted"" when this same stuffed animal pounds Mark Wahlberg in the head with a vicious flurry of furry punches slams him around the room and then whips his naked arse with a radio antenna. That has got to be one of the strangest things on film. ""Ted"" is the brainchild of Seth MacFarlane the reigning sophomoric man-child behind Foxs animated ""Family Guy."" For his big-screen debut MacFarlane directed co-wrote and co-produced; in addition he provides the voice of Ted the bad-boy plush toy who does all the dirty deeds described above. The engine driving the plot is Teds friendship with John (Wahlberg) a kind if breathtakingly dumb Boston slacker and the bears tendency to screw up Johns relationship with his perfect girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis). The movie does about what youd expect from a three-wheeled romantic comedy with an extraneous horror subplot - which involves some creepy dancing by Giovanni Ribisi It is deeply juvenile and profoundly surreal. The film also throws in lots of cameos (i.e. Ryan Reynolds) pro-forma digs at current celebrities (Taylor Lautner) and such outmoded 1980 cultural references as ""Flash Gordon"" and an old jingle for Mounds and Almond Joy. It employs similar narrative ""cutaways"" and reflexively offensive gags as ""Family Guy."" (MacFarlane isnt the only ""Family Guy"" guy with talking dogs as the focus. Showrunner David Zuckerman has developed the new television series ""Wilfred"" about a depressed fellow who experiences his neighbors dog as an Australian dude in a fuzzy suit.) The opening sequence narrated by a splendid plummy Patrick Stewart illustrates Teds magical transformation from inanimate Christmas gift into Johns best friend and ""thunder buddy."" And the older perverted Ted cracks some of the more revoltingly funny lines of the year. But for all of its transgressive plush-toy sex and screw-em humor the plot is pretty standard stuff. Whether MacFarlane and co-writers Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild are parodying conventions or merely exploiting them is hard to tell; fans will argue that MacFarlanes MO is far too irreverent and pop-savvy not to meet and mess with expectations. If the cliches are there - in the misty ""I love yous"" and emotional breakthroughs set to sniffling piano riffs - theyre there for purposes of mockery and mockery alone.

The story itself is about a boy and a bear in Boston who have refused to grow up and the girlfriend who has run out of patience. Its the ahem embellishments that make the film unique. If there is misbehaving to be done and there is a lot of it you can bet a bear is involved. The comic targets run the gamut a race religion relationships reality etc. While nothing is sacred the sacrilege comes with just enough sweetness to offset the salt.The main gag is no shock here the motion-capture creature Ted. Hes born of a Christmas wish in 1985 when a young John Bennett (Brett Manley Wahlberg is the grown-up version) awkward and friendless wishes that the teddy bear Santa brought him would come to life. Wish granted and almost overnight not only is Ted his new best friend hes a mega star making the rounds on the celebrity circuit. Until he isnt. That is where the story really kicks in. (MacFarlane best known for creating the animated TV hit ""Family Guy"" shares script credit with two other writers from the show Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild.)Flash-forward 30 years. Ted is a hard-partying has-been with a bong always close at hand and John is a never-was in a dead-end job at a car rental place. But they still have each other which is part of the problem. The issue is adulthood a why should anyone get serious about life when theres weed to be smoked and Flash Gordon saving the day on some cable channel? But there is the matter of Johns smartly turned out girlfriend Lori (Kunis). Four years into a relationship with John Lori demands that he choose. Its either the babe or the bear with a lot of breakups and makeups and mayhem before that gets resolved.Until now MacFarlanes brand of humor has been primarily showcased on his various animated series. His first and best remains ""Family Guy"" which just wrapped its 10th season on Fox. A lot of what is good about the show has found its way into ""Ted."" The pop culture cleverness is there the general lack of decorum most certainly is. Brian the shows erudite martini-sipping dog is what Ted might have become had he gotten an Ivy League education. As it is Ted himself sounds like a wasted version of Peter Griffin the good-hearted blue-collar dolt of a dad in ""Family Guy"" a character also voiced by MacFarlane. Other ""Family Guy"" family members turn up in the film most prominently Kunis who has voiced the Griffins misfit teen Meg from the beginning.Jumping into the no-holds-barred world of R-rated movies freed MacFarlane to push the profane to his hearts content. He does. It also gives him a chance to prove that he is as adept at working with real flesh and blood actors as animated figures. He is. It happens that hes even better when blending both worlds a at some point it is possible to forget than Ted is a plush toy until the next time he gets involved in some highly inappropriate ""manly"" pursuit.To help blur those lines everything in ""Teds"" universe has been designed to work equally well for man and beast. There are man-size and toy-size urinals the suits are made to fit conversations are mostly eye-to-eye sex is somehow possible if not very pretty. Though hes only 2 feet 6 (just a guess) Ted claims his own piece of the screen. One of the films natural highs comes in a knock-down drag-out fight with John a remarkable bit of choreographed rumbling and tumbling brought to bruising believable life. Michael Barrett as the director of photography and Blair Clark supervising visual effects do a bang-up job all around.Now to the sweetness. Wahlberg for all the toughness in many of his roles a his comeback boxer in""The Fighter""his score-settling detective in""The Departed""a has a lovable lug-ishness about him. It is very much on display here. Though Ted is a constant complication for John he never intends to cause problems. The guys really are best friends and weirdly you can feel the love.There are times when the jokes verge on the sour or even rancid. Even for ""Ted"" Giovanni Ribisis sick stalker type is twisted and some of the bits are too raw. But mostly ""Ted"" is a very guilty pleasure stuffed with so many sly cultural references and sardonic cameos its tough to catch them all but its fun trying. To fully appreciate ""Ted"" its best to simply forgive its bad behavior upfront and save any apologies for liking it until later.

Theres a scene in Ted - Seth MacFarlanes ridicuously crude and inspired fable about a grown man and his talking plush toy - in which Wahlbergs easygoing Beantown schmo John Bennett tries to guess the name of his best buddys new girlfriend. She has a typical ""white trash"" moniker and so John unleashes a mile-a-minute stream of possibilities. Wahlberg takes fast-talking to a whole new plane of existence. More about Ted >> The best buddy in Ted is of course Ted a teddy bear that John has had since he was 8. Voiced by MacFarlane the brains behind TVs animated series Family Guy and American Dad he was a Christmas gift from Johns parents to their lonely bullied boy. And in one of those magical miracles that happen in movies if not in life little John goes to sleep wishing Ted could be real. The next morning he is. And 27 years later John and Ted remain inseparable. They share a sense of humor (scatalogical sex-obsessed) a penchant for brewskis and a passion for the epically cheesy 1980 flick Flash Gordon. And they share a bong - with great frequency. They also share an apartment with Johns girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) who is beginning to feel like Ted is keeping John from well growing up. How can you take a relationship seriously when youre ready to drop everything to sit with your bear pal to watch the cast interviews from a DVD boxed set of Cheers? Throw in a gaggle of hookers named Heavenly Angelique and Sauvignon Blanc; throw in a Travis Bickle-like dad (Giovanni Ribisi finally put to good use) and his psycho son (Aedin Mincks) who want Ted for themselves; throw in the singer Norah Jones (dont ask); throw in Tom Skerritt as himself; throw in Loris blithely lecherous boss (Joel McHale); throw in Jessica Barth very funny as the slutty supermarket checkout girl Ted starts to date; and throw in Sam J. Jones also known as Flash Gordon himself and you have a cannabis-soaked comedy of ingenious absurdity. It should be noted however that behind all the pot jokes and potty jokes the trippy party scenes and the aforementioned hookers (one of whom leaves a decidedly unwelcome object on John and Loris floor) Ted is really a rather sweet examination of loyalty friendship and love. Wahlberg and Kunis are charming together (though not exactly in a Cary Grant / Audrey Hepburn kind of way) and both manage to play this thing - at least the challenges-of-a-serious-relationship part of this thing - straight. Which must have been hard to do when theyre interfacing with a puppet a doll. And speaking of interfacing theres a fight scene in a motel room - with Ted as one of the combatants - that is knockout hilarious. MacFarlanes approach to this his first feature is shameless. He intros the film with a sonorous sappy narration - delivered by Patrick Stewart (yes Charles Xavier Jean-Luc Picard himself) - that quickly establishes the mood of stoner irony. The writer/director delivers priceless pocket-sized pop-culture critiques too sizing up the worth (or lack therein) of Katy Perry Adam Sandler Channing Tatum and a pantheon of todays iconic giants. And if thats not enough the whole thing ends with a dramatic face-off high atop a tower at Fenway Park. The Red Sox arent playing but that doesnt stop Wahlberg Kunis MacFarlane and team from hitting a home run. Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

By Colin Covert Star Tribune July 2 2012 -- 410pm Video (2933)  Colin Covert says Ted is full of laughs and may even appeal to non Family Guy fans like himself. Shari L. Gross Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Welcome to the funniest comedy of 2012. Loony lewd and lovable ""Ted"" takes place on a stratospheric plane of preposterousness. Underachiever John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) made a childhood wish that his teddy bear would come to life and be his best friend forever. It came true. Ted was a media sensation but after his flurry of fame our celebrity-glutted society shrugged him off. Twenty-five years later John and Ted are affable couch spuds living a juvenile getting-by life cracking politically incorrect jokes and idling away their days with beer bong and TV. Whoever said there are only 10 basic plots overlooked this one. If this surreal take on the man-child and idiot-friend genres sounds cartoonish its to be expected. This is the first film from Seth MacFarlane creator of the animated ""Family Guy"" series. Once we buy the abracadabra premise (set up in a prologue narrated by syrupy faux-sincere Patrick Stewart) ""Ted"" respects plausibility and character integrity. It performs the essential magic act required of successful entertainment getting us to identify with the people onscreen even as they behave absurdly. And good gravy is this film ridiculous. Like MacFarlanes TV hit ""Ted"" presents the tribulations of daily life for a bizarre New England family. As Lori Johns successful supportive girlfriend Mila Kunis struggles to preserve a semblance of normality in their home life. Its not easy. The script is a free-form barrage of gross-out gags odd celebrity cameos and curveball jokes. It feels more stuck together with a glue gun than written but the sheer foulmouthed energy of the enterprise is irresistible. As Ted is eased out of Johns life and into his own apartment Johns loyalties remain divided. Even when the gags arent brilliant youre aghast at how far off the wall Wahlberg and company are willing to take them. There are feverishly inappropriate jokes here that will live on in dorm-room bull sessions forever. When skirt-chasing Ted lands a job as a grocery clerk he and a busty co-worker make the stockroom their love nest. You may never look at parsnips again without snickering. The film features a hamper full of sharply defined characters from Loris predatory popinjay boss (Joel McHale) to the psycho creep who wants Ted for his own little boy (Giovanni Ribisi). Kunis is sweet and demure though understandably impatient with her Peter Pan boyfriend and Wahlberg brings everydude charm and real tenderness to their romantic scenes. He even sends up his Marky Mark days with a tone-deaf romantic solo that sparks a mini-riot at a Norah Jones concert. Most remarkable of all is Ted himself (voiced by MacFarlane) the greatest comedic stuffed animal since ""Caddyshacks"" gopher. When the lifelong friends relationship hits bottom John angrily calls Ted ""Teddy Ruxpin."" The insult sparks a raucous room-wrecking brawl that goes on and on past any rational bounds and ends in such a frenzy of ferocity that laughter is the only release valve. Not everything works -- the momentum drops in the sentimental final chapter -- but there is more than enough here to keep audiences howling with laughter and hoping for a sequel.

(Universal Pictures) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday June 28 2012 151 PM Title Ted Film Info With Mark Wahlberg Mila Kunis Comedy about a man and his talking stuffed bear. Director Seth MacFarlane (146). R Language sexuality drugs violence. Area theaters. Sometimes it takes a special person to shake things up to remind us that weve been stuck in a rut and need a new perspective. Or as in the case of ""Ted"" it takes a special effect. For his big-screen directorial debut Seth MacFarlane has made a traditional buddy comedy in much the same way his animated TV show ""Family Guy"" is a traditional sitcom. Which is to say he works within a framework while simultaneously tearing it to shreds. He couldnt have asked for a better partner than Mark Wahlberg an excellent and eternally underappreciated straight man. In the past Wahlberg has generously ceded the spotlight to Christian Bale (""The Fighter"") Will Ferrell (""The Other Guys"") and his own anatomy (""Boogie Nights""). Here he plays second string to a toy. The story which MacFarlane wrote with ""Family Guys"" Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild introduces us to a lonely child named John who wishes for his stuffed bear to come to life. Magically enough it actually happens. In another movie John might have learned some valuable lessons from this miracle. In this movie John (Wahlberg) grows up to become an aimless Boston slacker whose extended adolescence is enabled by his equally juvenile stuffed animal. (The expertly computer-animated Ted is voiced by MacFarlane.) Even John realizes there are issues in living with a talking teddy bear -- chief among them the waning patience of his girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis). She wants to settle down. Ted who has the focus of an overindulged frat boy just wants to party. And John is stuck in the middle. ""Family Guy"" fans will find that MacFarlanes brand of skewed humor translates easily to the big screen built as it is on razor-sharp pop-culture references unabashedly bad taste and surprising flashes of sweetness. Not every joke scores of course. But the hits are worth the misses and anyway the movies true genius is in the way its outlandish scenario is played so perfectly straight. By following his own twisted logic with unwavering dedication MacFarlane simultaneously uses mocks and expands Hollywood conventions. The relationship between Ted and John is no more ridiculous than any other cliched bromance even though we know Wahlberg must have spent all his time on set acting opposite -- what? An actual teddy? MacFarlane? Nothing? Really it doesnt matter. True chemistry is hard to find. And by some stroke of movie magic -- or sheer skill -- Wahlberg and the bear make a pretty great team.

Dowd palled around with a big rabbit named Harvey. The furry guy didnt make himself known to others. He also didnt smoke a bong hang out with hookers swear like a sailor and sprinkle pop culture references like a Tarantino-age Johnny Appleseed.He left all that to Ted.The debut film from Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane begins with a fairy tale prologue that suggests magic is just a wish away. Little John Bennett wishes his teddy bear could talk a shooting star whizzes across the Boston sky and presto Ted comes alive like Frampton. The phenomenon is handled with blunt matter-of-factness that lets Ted gets down to its mission of flatulence jokes and that hallmark of contemporary comedy arrested male development.Its actually a brilliantly simple comic conceit Conjure a teddy bear the purest symbol of childhood innocence who tosses around the F-word like its going out of style and muses that his pot dealer needs to step up the stock. Bad Santa played a similar hand giving us an alcoholic St. Nick far more naughty than nice. Why not a stuffed animal with a yen for busty blondes and cocaine smeared on its face?Ted stays bestest buddies and roommates with John who grows up to be an affably slacking Mark Wahlberg. Johns girlfriend played by Mila Kunis tolerates the fuzzy rascal but would rather her man didnt sit around all day watching Flash Gordon with a foulmouthed stuffed animal. To the extent that its about anything - and it generally works better when it isnt -- Ted is yet another tale of bromance getting in the way of romance.Family Guy fans will recognize MacFarlanes nasally wise-guy delivery as Ted - think Borscht Belt with a heavy touch of modern snark - as well as the shows short attention span aesthetic and obsession with television and movies. Flash Gordon star Sam J. Jones plays a party animal version of himself and theres an odd running gag about actor Tom Skerritt. Its hard to escape the impression that MacFarlane grew up in a hermetically sealed room surrounded by wall-to-wall cable TV.If MacFarlanes scope is limited his wit is still a razor. Even when he plays scatological and relies on shock value hes simply a funny guy. Two of Teds preferred brands of marijuana are called ""Theyre coming theyre coming"" and ""This is permanent."" (Paranoia will destroy ya.) When a psycho stalker played by Giovanni Ribisi rambles on Ted cuts to the quick ""Can you email me the rest of this story?""Ted like so many comedies these days feels compelled to go soft and squishy with a prolonged and generic climax; it ultimately lacks the strength of its bad boy convictions. But until that point it provides consistent if shallow yuks some of them huge. You can overlook an awful lot in a comedy when it makes you laugh.Oh and Harvey? Hes on Broadway with Jim Parsons now. Ted would probably be more at home seeing a movie like Ted.TEDB Directed by Seth MacFarlane. R (language drugs sexual content bodily humor). 106 mins.

"Ted movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Ted Crude comedy doesnt quite bear up ??June 28 2012|Michael Phillips | Movie criticMark Wahlberg Mila Kunis and the voice of Seth MacFarlane star in ""Ted.""Like ""The Hangover""and its sequel ""Ted""is a bully of a comedy but a bully with just enough calculated heart to make it a hit. It plays like a movie tryout for a TV series specifically a Seth MacFarlane series which means a high quotient of startlingly crude ethnic and cultural stereotypes leavened by a sincere appreciation for American popular music of another era.The movies soundtrack promises old-time sentiment and heartfelt pathos with a little swing. The jokes meantime depend on how many R-rated synonyms there are for a womans vagina as spoken by a plush toy.As a boy young John grows up in a Boston suburb where beating up Jews for Christmas is an annual pastime. (Compare this joke to the one at the beginning of ""Borat."" One is dubious; the other one in ""Borat"" is inspired.) John wishes upon a star for a friend to call his own. His teddy bear becomes a talking teddy bear. The bear Ted enjoys some fame (appearing on Carson) John grows up into Mark Wahlberg the pair remain best pals and bong-devoted couch potatoes well into Johns arrested-development adulthood.""Ted"" concerns what John must do to earn the respect and devotion of his longtime public relations exec girlfriend played by Mila Kunis while still keeping disreputable trash-talking skank-chasing Ted in his life.This is MacFarlanes feature debut as a director and he co-wrote the script as well as producing and providing the voice of Ted. Ted sounds so much like Peter Griffin in MacFarlanes long-running Fox animated series ""Family Guy"" the script is shamed into referring to the resemblance. You can find this clever or you can find it lazy and this is why MacFarlane is the biggest mixed blessing in contemporary TV comedy He is both.The bits I like in ""Ted"" are not the bits such as the staggeringly brutal brawl between Ted and John or anything involving Teds sociopathic kidnappers. I do like MacFarlanes obsessive devotion to the 1980 film version of ""Flash Gordon"" starring Sam J. Jones who plays himself in ""Ted"" for reasons that ... well who cares. Like ""Family Guy"" ""Ted"" is only about its own hyperlinked pop culture references. Theres one scene in which Wahlberg does a parody of Robert Hays in ""Airplane"" doing a parody of John Travolta in""Saturday Night Fever"" and while it earns points for nerve nerve isnt everything in comedy. Plenty of people took their preteen kids to a recent downtown Chicago preview screening of ""Ted"" which was great just as it was great to hear one of those nervous and disoriented preteens screaming Teds nickname for vagina over and over and over all the way down Illinois Street.mjphillipstribune.comTed -- 2 starsMPAA rating R (for crude and sexual content pervasive language and some drug use)Running time 145Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesSeth MacFarlane on Million Ways to Die and Taking...April 29 2014Seth MacFarlanes Ted Comes to Zynga Slot-Machine GameMarch 13 2014Oscars Seth MacFarlane is an Academy guyFebruary 23 2013Seth MacFarlane Shopping Pay-TV Comedy Blunt Talk Eyeing...April 29 2014Find More Stories AboutComedyJohn TravoltaSeth MacfarlaneTedTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-mov-0629-ted-20120629,0,2494881.column",200,ted21,ted,chicagotribune

And there is nothing I like less in a movie short of mutilation than jokes about flatulence so you take my point. This is no-holds-barred humor of the finest grossest kind centered around the theme of arrested development. The genteel and prudish should stay away and if by some chance The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is sold out and you end up at Ted dont send me emails expressing your dismay about its crude politically incorrect stoner humor. I warned you. Have the nice people clicked away? Okay good. The rest of you watch the bongwater; it can really screw up your laptop. Teds setup calls to mind The Beaver another movie about dependency on a stuffed animal although Ted is free of The Beavers pretensions and the unpleasantness of trying to get the audience to sympathize with Mel Gibson. Its also about a hundred times funnier. John Bennett (played as a child by Bretton Manley and by Mark Wahlberg as an adult) is 8 and desperate for a friend. He gets a teddy bear for Christmas wishes it could talk (beyond ""I Love You"" which it says when you squish it) and a shooting star makes it so. All of this is narrated by Patrick Stewart in lovely plummy ""Once upon a time"" style narration but interrupted by gloriously wicked random segues (Christmas he intones as the camera travels over Johns neighborhood is ""that special season when Boston children get together and--theres a beat--beat up the Jewish kids""). After their initial horror Johns parents embrace Ted as well and the talking bear becomes one of the family. They dont keep Ted a secret either; hes all over the news and an 80s celebrity. Thanks to the magic of computers we even see his appearance opposite Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show. (READ TIMEs review of The Beaver another story of a dude and his stuffed animal) Fast-forward 27 years and John (now played by Mark Wahlberg) and Ted are still best friends living in a brick townhouse in Boston. Only the bear no longer coos and burbles like Snuggles. Now he sounds like the ultimate frat boy pig but loveable. Credit for that miracle goes to MacFarlane who voices Ted and--thanks to motion-capture technology--was able to provide the bears hyper-realistic movements. Instead of cuddling up together to watch Flash Gordon Ted and John do bong hits on the couch together. Actually they never stopped watching Flash Gordon they just added the bong hits. And some brewskis. Because John is 35 stoned half the time and only ambitious enough to work at a rental car company his gorgeous girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis who has been working with MacFarlane on Family Guy since before she was old enough to drive) asks him to get Ted to move out. Shes not putting pressure on John to get married but she would like him to grow up. The bear has to get an apartment and a job. Thats easier than youd expect--one of the best jokes of the movie is the fact that the entire world accepts the talking stuffed animal--and soon Ted is ringing up groceries. ""Im a former celebrity in a minimum wage job"" Ted says glumily. ""This must be how the cast of Different Strokes feels."" John and Ted do their best but despite good intentions the boyish man and the mannish bear have a very hard time staying away from each other. (READ About Wahlberg in a totally different kind of role) I saw Ted in Boston a particular pleasure since MacFarlane skewers just about everything about the place the women who Ted claims screech ""haaaardah"" during sex and then stuff their faces with Pepperidge Farm cookies; people from Quincy; Catholic hooligans. Theres a well-placed joke about Cheers (and a cast member cameo). Ted even cracks wise about the fish at the New England Aquarium. Only the swan boats are safe from MacFarlanes savage mockery. At every spot-on reference the audience roared with appreciation. My notebook quickly filled with one-liners from the bear most of them unprintable. Theres something of Boogie Nights Dirk Diggler in Wahlbergs performance. John is an innocent--banished by Lori he reads TinTin in a hotel room--but less of a stooge than Dirk. And he does more than play the straight man; he gets laughs on his own. A sequence where he and Ted brawl is inspired. As for Kunis you sense MacFarlanes fondness for her in the way hes written the character; Lori has to be the most reasonable movie girlfriend of the year but shes not a doormat. The supporting cast which includes cameos by a famous singer is also first-rate especially Giovanni Ribisi as a furtive mustached Ted fan who wants to buy the bear for his son and wont take no for an answer. Teds girlfriend (yes he has one) spots Ribisi lurking in a dark alley wearing a flannel shirt and looking nutty. ""Who is that?"" she asks. ""That was Sinead OConnor"" Ted tells her. ""She dont look so good anymore."" Isnt that awful? But how I laughed. (READ Why we love Mila Kunis. Or one of the reasons) And I did so right up until the end although less heartily at the climax. The bubble doesnt exactly burst in the last ten minutes of the movie but it does deflate. Everyone who sets a movie in Boston seems obligated to include a scene at Fenway but once youve seen Fever Pitch everything else has a tendency to pale. MacFarlane who shares credit for the screenplay along with Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild doesnt so much reach a resolution for his characters as he does take them in a circle. But by then I was too exhausted from laughing to care. MacFarlane has definitely made the best leap from animated television to movies since 1999s South Park Bigger Longer amp; Uncut.

"Ted | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; ted ) Ted (United States 2012) June 28 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Ted is essentially a one-joke movie. Okay its a very funny joke but its still only one joke. As a short this could have been brilliant - hilarious irreverent and blisteringly satirical. I laughed a lot during the first half hour not as much during the second half hour and still less during the rest. Theres not quite enough material in the concept to fill a 100-plus minute motion picture. Director/writer Seth MacFarlane plugs some of the holes with his trademark impudence but theres still a feeling of padding. Ted starts out with a bang though and the problems it has with sustaining that high level are more an indictment of the length of the film than of the quality of the humor. Ted opens in suburban Boston on the day before Christmas 1985. With Patrick Stewart narrating it briefly sounds like were going to enter a world of magic and nostalgia... until were told about the favorite pastime of WASPy pre-teen boys. Living in this idealized community is John Bennett (who will grow up to be played by Mark Wahlberg) a seven-year old outcast with no friends who immediately becomes attached to his favorite Christmas present an oversized teddy bear. That night he makes an ill-advised wish for Teddy to come to life and because nothing is more powerful than a young boys wish (except an Apache helicopter) John awakens to discover that for the first time in his life he has a best friend. The scene in which he introduces Teddy to his parents is priceless. The bulk of the movie transpires 27 years later with Ted (voice provided by Seth MacFarlene) and John hanging around as stoner brothers. Ted isnt your average cute lovable talking teddy bear. He curses like a longshoreman smokes weed like a character in a Judd Apatow movie and is as raunchy as one can imagine from a stuffed animal who is not anatomically correct. Hes also a major impediment in the romantic relationship between John and his girlfriend of four years Lori (Mila Kunis). Eventually she becomes so weary of Teds antics that she demands he move out - or else. Getting Ted his own apartment however doesnt solve the problem and for John it soon comes down to a simple choice Ted or Lori. While some of the comedy during the first 30-to-45 minutes arises from the concept of a smoking drinking swearing stuffed animal its more about MacFarlenes audaciousness than anything else. Known primarily as the creator of the animated programs Family Guy American Dad and The Cleveland Show MacFarlane is making his first venture into live action and his brand of humor translates effectively especially within the bounds of the R rating. He doesnt pull any punches which is refreshing and the use of a childs toy makes the film feel more ""naughty"" than it might otherwise. In terms of depravity and raunchiness theres nothing in Ted that one-ups the material in The Hangover or Harold and Kumar - but thats plenty far out on the tightrope for a movie about a stuffed animal. In order to stretch out the running length MacFarlane inserts some odd subplots (including one featuring Loris lecherous boss) and tangents (the creepy bear-napper played by Giovanni Ribisi) that propel the narrative forward in fits and starts. Theres a heavy dose of 80s nostalgia thats capped off by repeated references to the 1980 camp classic Flash Gordon and features the star of that movie Sam Jones in costume (at age 58). Other cameos include Norah Jones Tom Skerritt and Ryan Reynolds. The Patrick Stewart narration is arguably MacFarlanes masterstroke since no one can narrate quite like Stewart (except perhaps Morgan Freeman) and the content of the narration doesnt quite match what one expects from those powerful British pipes. Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis play second and third fiddle to Ted who is so well rendered that its easy to forget hes a product of motion capture-driven special effects. Sometimes the most pleasing uses of CGI come in little packages like this. Neither Wahlberg nor Kunis can boast an especially interesting character or story arc and Wahlberg displays more chemistry with his fuzzy co-star than with his human love interest. The movies emotional element relies heavily on the viewers memories of a stuffed toy; therein lies the core of Teds appeal. Ultimately were more likely to care about the relationship between Ted and John than the one between John and Lori. The screenplay especially shortchanges Kunis; her role requires little more than that she look attractive. Its fair to argue that Ted suffers to a degree from a common problem with comedies - the inability to maintain comedic momentum over the full length of a movie. One wonders whether MacFarlanes unfamiliarity with the long format might be partially to blame; after all his comfort level is in working with 22-minute bites. Whatever the case Ted still generates more than enough laughs to justify the price of a ticket but take the R-rating seriously. This is as family-friendly as a divorce lawyer; if you want a kids film about a cuddly bear seek out Winnie the Pooh.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> If you watch the animated hijinks on TVs Family Guy The Cleveland Show and American Dad you know that Seth MacFarlane the brainy bawdy creator of those kickass shows does not cater to audiences who call him juvenile stupid vulgar and foul-mouthed. So stop reading MacFarlane haters. Ted is not for you. MacFarlanes debut as a feature director hits all the sweet spots that irritate prudes. Is it dirty? Yes. Does it take full advantage of the R rating? Oh my yes. Is it funny? Its hysterically gut-bustingly funny. Mark Wahlberg is just terrific as John Bennett a good-natured Boston dude who wonders if hell ever be responsible enough to marry his girlfriend Lori (a gorgeously feisty Mila Kunis). Finding the right job isnt the problem. The problem is Ted a toy bear John has been living with since childhood. Back then he wished for a walking talking bear whod love him as a friend and comfort him when thunder comes. Wham Johns wish comes true. Ted pops into life scaring Johns parents and becoming a media celebrity. Ted goes on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. He smokes pot. He picks up hookers. The fickle public grows tired of him. But not John. John stays Teds friend. Theyre ""thunder buddies"" crawling into bed at the mere sound of a rumble from the sky. What worked for John as a kid doesnt cut it with Lori. She wants John to herself. Thats the plot MacFarlane cooked up with Family Guy collaborators Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild. Best of all MacFarlane does Teds voice in a way that sounds even more Boston than Wahlbergs. Using the latest in motion-capture techniques MacFarlane even does Teds moves. And boy can Ted move. Wahlberg played their scenes together basically staring at a stick with the computer adding Ted later. But it works. The scene in which John tries to guess the name of the white-trash girl Ted wants to marry is time-capsule worthy. As is the ""Thunder Buddies"" song (""Fuck you thunder/you can suck my dick""). You get the point. I wont spoil another joke. See Ted. MacFarlane is a fresh new voice in movies. I want to hear more.

"Ted (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Ted (R) Lewd crude comedy about a man and his talking teddy bear directed by Seth (""Family Guy"") MacFarlane. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com6/28/2012 Editor rating 2 In Ted a grown man (Mark Wahlberg) must decide between his girlfriend (Mila Kunis) and a talking stuffed teddy bear (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) hes loved since childhood. This is exactly the same plot as The Muppets in which Jason Segel was forced to choose between Amy Adams and Kermit the Frog. The main difference I think is that at no time in The Muppets did Kermit take bong hits or snort cocaine or knock back tequila shots or have sex with a woman in the stock room of a grocery store. Then again The Muppets was a family film and Ted is rated R as in really not suitable for children under 17 without an adult guardian. The movie marks the directorial debut of MacFarlane who also co-wrote the script and voices the eponymous doll -- and is everything one would expect from the creator of TVs corrosively irreverent Family Guy freed at last from the constraints of network TV. The cheerfully inappropriate sense of humor extends beyond four-letter words although MacFarlane certainly has a way with those This is a comedy designed to elicit gales of shocked laughter from its audience which it often does until it turns into E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. The set-up is fairy-tale simple. In 1985 a kid in the Boston suburbs named John wishes his beloved teddy bear would come to life and the next morning it does. Flash-forward to the present John is now 35 years old (Wahlberg) and still inseparable from Ted who looks the same on the outside but has definitely matured on the inside. The doll is the embodiment of male arrested development Hes almost 40 but still consumed with the relentless pursuit of hedonistic pleasures. He has the libido of an 18 year-old boy and the impulsive nature to match. Johns longtime girlfriend Lori (Kunis) has been accepting of Teds constant presence into the couples lives (one of the best conceits in the movie is that everyone can see Ted walk and talk not just John). But she draws the line after the couple returns home from dinner to find Ted having a crazy party with four hookers one of whom somehow managed to poop on the living room floor. Him or me she tells John -- Sophies choice. At heart Ted is just another story about a guy who must set aside his childish interests and grow up in order to keep the girl. But MacFarlane throws in a lot of stuff to distract you from the formula beginning with his ingenious creation Ted is a genuinely wondrous feat of special effects work with simple but expressive features that is blended so skillfully into the live action that the illusion is seamless. You forget youre watching CG animation. Wahlberg is sweet and likable as the lunk-headed man-child (imagine how excruciating the movie would have been with say Adam Sandler in the role). As he does on Family Guy MacFarlane constantly sneaks in pop-culture references and asides most noticeably shout-outs to 1980s movies the decade that presumably influenced him the most. The references range from the overt (especially Flash Gordon and hilariously Octopussy) to the subtle (Raiders of the Lost Ark The Outsiders). And then in its final 20 minutes Ted loses its merciless satirical edge and goes shockingly soft. Suddenly the teddy bear that had earlier helped John choose which marijuana to buy (""Mind Rape"" ""Gorilla Panic"" or ""This is Permanent"") is in mortal danger and needs to be rescued MacFarlane decides to take the entire premise seriously and even tug at the heart strings because he cant figure out a way to resolve the films central triangle. So he doesnt. Instead he opts to distract you with flashing lights and shockingly blatant sentimentality. During one long shot late in the film designed to make you blubber I kept waiting for the director to pull the trigger and drop in the joke but it never came This is all meant to be taken at face value. Like last years Paul another ode to 1980s-era filmmaking Ted is more of an idea than a movie a string of jokes and homages starring a cartoon and some game actors whose performances are destined to be enjoyed in chunks rarely from start to finish during momentary breaks of channel surfing on late-night TV.

"Ted movie review -- Ted showtimes - The Boston Globe Depreston | Courtney Barnett Listen Live Boston.com HomeTodays GlobeNewsYour TownBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsReal Estate Movies Restaurants Music Theater/Art Television Celebrity news Events Comics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie review Ted A crass but hilarious bromance By Ty Burr Globe Staff / June 28 2012 E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + E-mail E-mail this article To Invalid E-mail address Add a personal message(80 character limit) Your E-mail Invalid E-mail address Sending your article Your article has been sent. You may possibly know someone like Ted. Hes the best friend who graduated high school with you 15 years ago but who never moved on. Who takes up semipermanent residence on your couch with a bottle a bong or the remote. Who always has a great idea that gets you in trouble with your girlfriend. No need to tell him to get stuffed. In ""Ted"" he already is.Writer-director Seth MacFarlanes debut feature film is a crass foul-mouthed mostly hilarious surprisingly sentimental bromance about a grown boy named John and his teddy bear. John warm and wonderfully dim is played by Mark Wahlberg. The teddy bear Ted is voiced by MacFarlane with the punchy Boston accent of a guy who hangs out at the packie all day.Years ago in his lonely youth John wished his Christmas present would come to life and through the miracle of angels and digital effects it did. Now John is 35 and trying to be a grown-up with a girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) and a job. Ted with his taste for weed politically incorrect jokes and hookers is all thats holding him back.If youre a fan of MacFarlanes animated TV empire -- the long-running ""The Family Guy"" and its various iterations -- youll know to expect cheerfully smutty gags and smart pop-culture throwaways. ""Ted"" just increases the verbal filth. Its remarkably inoffensive for all that although anyone who takes a child to this just because theres a teddy bear on the poster should have their head examined.The movie works not because the gross-out jokes are funny (MacFarlane bats about 2 out of 3) but because the two central relationships between John and Kuniss tough tender Lori and between John and Ted feel real -- or real enough. Ted really is that friend you cant outgrow even when you want to who shares your taste for bad 80s movies  and who believes adulthood can be avoided if you just dont show up for it.Around that core dilemma MacFarlane scatters characters and comic riffs and a lot of famous people playing themselves. (Ryan Reynolds youd expect but Norah Jones?) Some of the plot tangents like a bear-napper played by an unctuously creepy Giovanni Ribisi dont go anywhere. Others like a rent-bash that spins out of control you never want to leave. MacFarlane is used to the confines of animated TV comedy and he can misjudge his tone A few of the live-action gags here play like cartoons. But all he has to do is put his reluctantly job-seeking teddy bear in a little black suit grumbling ""I look like Snuggless accountant"" and hes on inspired ground.""Ted"" is not for audiences who frown at juvenile humor clever or otherwise. On the other hand anyone seeking a filmed Boston that feels close to home will rejoice in the specificity of the locations. Not just the Zakim Bridge but the Hatch Shell and not just the South End but the corner of Chandler and St. Charles. Any director can end a movie at Fenway Park. To finish up atop the Green Monster you need to have lived here.Its not just the places that ""Ted"" captures but the accents and attitudes. When Ted asks John for a hug by saying ""Bring it in ya bastid"" I thought Id been transported back to the old Garden circa 1973. And when ""Ted"" opens with a mock-nostalgic Christmas flashback memorializing ""that special time when Boston children gather together and beat up the Jewish kids"" you know MacFarlane understands our civic disunions more clearly than any outsider. Better he knows how to nuke them with laughter.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. Follow him on Twitter tyburr. (c) Copyright 2012 Globe Newspaper Company.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Mark Wahlberg possesses a childlike sweetness that makes it surprisingly easy to believe that his best friend could be a foul-mouthed pot-smoking yet adorable talking teddy bear--and that such a friendship would be a pairing of equals. The feature directorial debut of Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane Ted makes inspired use of the ingratiating innocence behind Wahlbergs working-class toughness resulting in an incongruously cute interspecies buddy comedy thats powered alternately by the pixie dust of boyhood imagination and the ruder cruder urges of adolescence. Wahlberg stars as a 35-year-old slacker in a go-nowhere job at a rental-car place. His life as the adoring boyfriend of the gorgeous Mila Kunis and roommate and best pal of a sentient wisecracking teddy bear (voiced by MacFarlane who also co-wrote the script and produced) gives him little reason to grow up. That changes however when the otherwise insanely patient Kunis (making the most of an underwritten role) asks Wahlberg to lose Ted as a roommate as a means of kick-starting Wahlbergs tardy voyage to maturity. Making matters worse the pals face an outside threat in the form of an even-creepier-than-usual Giovanni Ribisi. MacFarlane has received a lot of criticism much of it justified for favoring pop-culture references over character-based comedy but the funniest moments in Ted are rooted in Wahlbergs relationship with his furry buddy. As a stunted manchild and his incorrigible best friend Wahlberg and MacFarlane have a wonderfully lived-in chemistry that carries the film through intermittent rough patches. Even the pop-culture references serve the themes A running gag involving Wahlberg and MacFarlanes deification of cheesy 80s icon Sam Jones (Flash Gordon) for example is funny in its own right while speaking to the comfort the two soul mates find in never evolving beyond the goofy pleasures of boyhood. After the rollicking first two acts climax with a go-for-broke party sequence MacFarlanes film runs headfirst into a brick wall as thriller elements awkwardly introduced early in the film come to the fore. Ted is never stronger than when Wahlberg and MacFarlanes Ted hang out riff and luxuriate in an easy friendship but as it lurches to a conclusion Ted unwisely devotes far too much of its time to a plot it would be better off ignoring. Ted requires Wahlberg to grow up and prove himself as a man but he and the film are a lot more fun when theyre goofing around.

Joe Retaliation Spot Watch Seth MacFarlane Mark Wahlberg and a Swearing Bear in Ted Red Band Trailer ""Family Guy"" creator Seth MacFarlanes debut film is as erratic as you might think but the hilarious hits more than compensate for the muddled misses Grown-up boys and their childhood toys have been a recurring feature of American comedies lately from Steve Carrell finally unloading his vintage action figures in ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" to Jerry Ferraras enforced separation from his Voltron collection in ""Think Like a Man."" Making his big-screen debut as co-writer (with Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild) and director ""Family Guy"" creator Seth MacFarlane takes the idea to an insanely logical extreme in ""Ted"" a movie about what happens 30 years or so after a kid gets his wish for a talking living teddy bear. Whatever your feelings about ""Family Guy"" theyll be borne out by ""Ted."" Fans of the animated series will enjoy the outrageous scatological humor and dips into a vast pool of pop-culture obscurities including a snake-eating-its-own-head moment where MacFarlane satirizes a famous movie scene that is itself a satire of yet another famous movie scene. But even those less enamored with MacFarlanes scattershot style will admit that there are plenty of funny moments here surrounded by laggy airless bits. Either way the stuff that sticks to the wall is so outrageously hilarious that its ultimately worth enduring the films lackadaisical pacing and lazy misogyny (more on that in a moment). As a friendless young boy our hero John receives a teddy bear for Christmas and that night he wishes with all his might that the toy would come to life. The next morning Ted is walking and talking and after some initial horror from Johns parents Ted becomes a celebrity of the moment (as a talking teddy bear would) sitting on Johnny Carsons couch and making the cover of Entertainment Weekly. Decades later Ted (voiced by MacFarlane) is a happy (and potty-mouthed) has-been amiably slacking his way through life with adult John (Mark Wahlberg) despite being a cuddly metaphor for his human companions lack of maturity. Johns girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) wants Ted to move out to his own place but the cord between John and Ted isnt so easily severed not when there are bong hits and ""Cheers"" DVD extras to be shared. Also read Watch Seth MacFarlane Mark Wahlberg and a Swearing Bear in Ted Red Band Trailer From its references to film (particularly one very silly 1980s sci-fi cult flick) and TV to its clever gross-out humor ""Ted"" is very very funny when it wants to be. Wahlbergs often-underrated comic chops get a real workout here and hes thoroughly convincing as a man-child who gets frightened in thunderstorms and who hides his eyes when Lori has to clean up their living floor after one of Teds guests er befouls it. But when the movie isnt funny we have to endure stale homilies about friendship and growing up and the very talented Kunis gets stuck playing the nag who drags Wahlbergs character into adulthood. Lori winds up being the one mommy in a movie otherwise full of whores both literally and figuratively. (Kunis does at least score a few laughs along the way and her pairing with Wahlberg is certainly a step up from their last collaboration the dreadful ""Max Payne."") Like its cuddly title character -- the effects work that brings Ted to life is top-notch -- its impossible to stay mad at ""Ted."" It may slip up occasionally but it more than makes up for its mistakes with some of the biggest laughs Ive had at the movies in ages. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

John has a patient babe of a girlfriend in Lori (super-game saucer-eyed dream date Mila Kunis). But after four years of herculean tolerance Lori is getting tired of Teds loutishness and the whole threes-company deal in the apartment -- APAHTment -- they all share. Predictably breaking up with Ted and growing the eff up isnt easy for boy-man John. He may be 35 but hes got the life skills of a 9-year-old. Fans of the MacFarlane thumbscrew touch -- sexual raunch vulgarity gleeful political incorrectness mocking pop culture references -- get what they pay for here. The bear is aggressively boorish. John is a poster schlub for arrested development. A slapdash subplot involving bearnapping (and Giovanni Ribisi) adds nothing. The picture looks schlubby too -- all muddy colors bad interior decor hectic pacing and joyless scenes in which this clunky inexpressive CG-animated fuzz-toy goes postal. And yet. And yet Gawd help me the always surprising Mark Wahlberg throws himself into his thespian adventure with such radiant wacko energy so full of Boston beans that Ted is also kind of well impressively nuts. Kunis is cute. Celebrities who shouldnt have bothered turn up for a couple of nifty punchlines. So even though MacFarlane insistently references the cheesy 1980 sci-fi flick Flash Gordon like an annoying obsessive child and even though a lot of the movie is grating dumb-assery its something to behold. Stuffed with crap but something.

Ted Bad to fair Director Seth MacFarlane. Cast Mark Wahlberg Mila Kunis Seth MacFarlane. Rating R for crude and sexual content pervasive language and some drug use. In the case of ""Ted"" a boy named John played as an adult by Mark Wahlberg wishes in 1985 that the teddy bear he gets for Christmas could really talk to him be a real friend (John doesnt have any of the human variety). And so it does. If youre a fan of ""Family Guy"" and its particular brand of humor perhaps you have wished that the shows creator Seth MacFarlane would co-write and direct a feature film. And so with ""Ted"" he does. This might be a good time to mention something. I hate ""Family Guy."" And yet I didnt hate ""Ted."" Nor did I like it that much. The one-note joke plays out longer and better than you might expect at least for a while. But not forever. As with ""Family Guy"" MacFarlane and co-writers Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild make some pretty funny pop-culture references taking shots at well-deserved if easy targets. But they also indulge an odd tone-deaf mean streak Ive never understood. Its not one of those things where you feel bad for laughing. Its one of those things where you dont laugh and feel bad for the people who do. After a prologue in which Ted comes to life -- freaking out Johnnys parents is a nice touch -- and the bear becomes a celebrity (even appearing on Johnny Carson) we land in the present in which John Ted (MacFarlane provides his voice) and Lori (Mila Kunis) Johns girlfriend share an apartment. Lori has a good job at a public-relations firm but John floats along through life getting stoned with Ted watching the 1980 film ""Flash Gordon"" repeatedly and working at a car-rental place when he gets around to it. John and Ted are perfectly happy with the way their lives are going but Lori is starting to get restless waiting for John to make more of himself. When after a nice dinner celebrating their fourth anniversary John and Lori come home to find Ted sitting on a couch with a bunch of hookers one of whom has taken a game of truth or dare to a disgusting extreme shes had enough. Ted has to go. After being best friends for 27 years this separation takes its toll -- or would if John wasnt continually visiting Ted to get stoned watch ""Flash Gordon"" and ... well you get the idea. A subplot involving Joel McHale as Loris lecherous boss never really goes anywhere. But its better than the other subplot in which Giovanni Ribisi plays a creepy man who wants to buy Ted for his son (Aedin Mincks). And yet with nowhere else to go really MacFarlane spends a good bit of the last part of the film on this. Kunis is a funny actress though here she mostly just has to portray various levels of angry or outraged. Wahlberg has the tougher role and its a credit to his talents that ""Ted"" is as good as it is. Say this for the guy he doesnt go halfway.

Wonders never cease. Who ever dreamed I could (or would even on a dare) sit through a two-hour movie about Mark Wahlberg and a talking teddy bear? Or that I would (or could even at gunpoint) possibly enjoy it so much? But here is Ted--a genre-screwing Donnybrook that defies description and guarantees I swear open-mouthed hilarity. It is refreshingly oblivious to the kind of political correctness that is going to be the death of us all. It is rude raunchy and repellent to the point of almost being a send-up of the Farrelly Brothers Judd Apatow Adam Sandler and the rest of the ozone polluters giving movies a bad name. (Address your complaints to the nearest sewer.) It contains dialogue and depicts situations that cannot be described in a family newspaper--including the ones that are read only by the Addams family. It has nudity profanity and X-rated detritus unsuitable for anyone with an I.Q. of 50. It is also creative adorable ingenious and devilishly thigh-slappingly hilarious. Do not take my pulse. It must be the heat. Boston 1985. John Bennett an unhappy 8-year-old boy and victim of school bullying gets a teddy bear for Christmas. He kisses it names it Ted and vows to love it forever making only one wish--that Ted could really talk. The next morning when the neighborhood bullies are busy beating up the Jewish kids on Christmas Day a miracle has turned Ted into a talking Pooh that becomes a national celebrity and a popular guest on Johnny Carson. Nobody can shut Ted up including Seth MacFarlane the multitasking hyphenate power player responsible for the outrageous animated TV sitcom Family Guy. He is the voice of Ted and this is his feature-film debut as a director. I have never been a fan of the TV show but among his other talents Mr. MacFarlane has recently unveiled his secret passion for singing Broadway and movie show tunes and big-band jazz on a sensational new CD that has not left my player long enough to mix a fresh cosmo. His music is good and theres plenty of that too. Whatever else you think of the movie the soundtrack swings. But I digress. Twenty-seven years pass John grows up to be a 35-year-old Mark Wahlberg and Ted grows up to be a potty-mouthed pot-smoking beer-guzzling woman-chasing reprobate everybody would like to send back to any toy store that will take him. Ted does everything to break up John and his loyal long-suffering girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) but John is a grown man who still cant sleep in a thunderstorm without his stuffed teddy bear. Lori doesnt get a minutes peace even in bed. She even comes home from a lovely romantic anniversary dinner to find Ted entertaining four hookers one of whom has done something on the living-room floor no maid will clean up. Forced to choose John moves Ted into his own apartment but the funny antics (contrived I admit) are just beginning. A creepy guy with a humongous son who wants Ted for his own kinky nursery games stalks him in an ominous van. ""Who was that?"" asks John. ""That was Sinead OConnor"" says Ted. ""She dont look so good no more."" The script bounces off the wall like a rubber Cassius Clay doll while movie references abound. Ted talks like Little Caesar and takes bubble baths like cigar-smoking Edward G. Robinson. Jousting with sensitive subjects such as minorities and headline tragedies flaunting convention in a determined effort to offend just about everybody Ted (as the voice of Seth MacFarlane) mouths insults in the words of Seth MacFarlane (as the voice of Ted). In no time you cant tell one from the other. I ended up loving them both. The CGI Ted has digital features that morph into awesome expressions. He can look and act querulous hurt sensitive impish or obnoxious depending on the line. When the fat psychotic kid pulls his ear off Ted yells ""Back off Susan Boyle"" But while you roar at Teds aside to the audience (""Someone had to go Joan Crawford on that kid"") you can also feel the ""Ouch"" Peace is restored when Lori saves Ted from his kidnappers and Ted saves Lori from her oversexed boss an A-hole who collects lurid artifacts like John Lennons glasses and Lance Armstrongs testicles ""freeze-framed and bronzed."" Theres a guest appearance by an aging Sam Jones who played Flash Gordon a Norah Jones concert where Mr. Wahlberg reverts to his old Marky Mark days and sings ""The Love Theme From Octopussy"" and a vicious duck named James Franco. You had to be there. In fact most of Ted eludes description analysis and explanation. You just have to hold onto your own certifiable sense of humor and let Mr. MacFarlane take you where he wants to go. Then get out of the way and enjoy it. Will it make you wince with embarrassment? Thats a promise. Will you also laugh? In double-time like a Rockette. I dont want to see a string of sequels about Ted who has now worn out his welcome like Bonzo. But one time around this summertime sandbox has left me cooled off like a hydrant spray in a heat wave and limp with laughter. rreedobserver.com TED Running Time 106 minutes Written by Seth MacFarlane Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild Directed by Seth MacFarlane Starring Mark Wahlberg Mila Kunis and Seth MacFarlane 3/4 Comment Filed under Broadway childhood friendship Mark Wahlberg Mila Kunis movie Movie Review Seth MacFarlane Teddy Bear Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture The Man Who Made Blue Oyster Cult RIP Producer Sandy Pearlman Culture No Alarms No Surprises Why Buying Concert Tickets Is a Rigged System Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://observer.com/2012/06/ted-rex-reed-seth-macfarlane-mark-wahlberg-mila-kunis/,200,ted33,ted,com/2012/06/ted-rex-reed-seth-macfarlane-mark-wahlberg-mila-kunis/

(His voicework is equally all over the map with MacFarlane switching from 50s crooner to blue-collar lunkhead to baby-as-Bond-villain in a single beat.) That scattershot sensibility is all over his first live-action feature with punch lines involving Katy Perry Susan Boyle Lance Armstrongs cancerous testicle the theme to Octopussy and--the films most fertile running joke--the cheesetastic glory of 1980s Flash Gordon whizzing by at warp speed. MacFarlane may be the only person wholl blatantly ape the Zucker brothers style and make an actual Zuckers reference (one scene quotes Airplanes homage to Saturday Night Fever--a triple meta score) but the real comic payoff lies in Teds simple conceit a lonely boy miraculously wishes his teddy bear into becoming a real live friend. Cut to 30 years later the now-grown man (Mark Wahlberg) is doing bong hits and talking f-bombed trash with his enabling immature furry buddy (voiced by MacFarlane) much to the consternation of his long-suffering girlfriend (Mila Kunis). Feel free to shake your head all you want You cant overestimate how funny it is to watch a stuffed bear behave boorishly go on coke binges and engage in the greatest man-versus-plush-toy fistfight ever committed to celluloid--or how impressive it is that MacFarlane actually milks the movies high-concept premise for emotional resonance. But while the adherence to Family Guys obsessive-compulsive offensiveness and tangential gags will delight the shows fans everyone else will find the gratuitously incessant riffing grafted onto an Apatovian narrative to be a mismatched coupling. Was the absurdist idea of a talking boozing blonde-humping Teddy Ruxpin considered not enough grist for the hilarity mill on its own? Ted ends up undermining both halves of its whole as well as its creators clear intent to add something a little deeper to his crassness. You can leave childish things behind the movie tells us without having to give up the friendships forged during those years. MacFarlane may need to jettison his adolescent belief that cramming every moment with two winks and a zinger exponentially ups the gutbusting however before he can hit his real artistic stride.

Sign up for our Newsletters. Daily Edition Login to download Ted Film Review 900 AM PDT 6/22/2012 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Universal Vulgar and funny comedy about a potty-mouthed stuffed bear beats ""The Beaver"" by a long shot and transfers ""Family Guy"" humor to the big screen with ease. TWITTER Seth MacFarlanes comedy starring Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis follows a man and his teddy bear who comes to life as the result of a childhood wish. The merrily rude humor of Family Guy slides right into feature films with nary a burp nor a fart in Ted a raucously funny goof about a boozing pot-smoking foul-mouthed teddy bear who would be instant new best friends with The Hangover guys. Not too many films serve up laughs that just keep on rolling with regularity from beginning to end but Seth MacFarlanes directorial debut does so and without any feeling of strain. Theres admittedly something a bit weird about the premise that might keep away some viewers who would otherwise belly up for a good gross comedy but the comedy quotient is more than high enough to prompt upbeat word-of-mouth and solid summer business. PHOTOS 10 Inappropriately Sexy Cartoon Characters MacFarlanes wise-ass ecumenically offensive joke-making is recognizable from the first scene in which a bunch of suburban Christian kids celebrate Christmas by beating up the neighborhood Jewish kid who in the middle of things warns the unpopular kid not to help him out. Poor little John Bennett has no friends at all until his parents offer him his dreamed-of present a stuffed bear who fulfills the boys wish of coming alive. Naturally this one-of-a-kind walking and talking creature becomes a national celebrity in 1985 and a wonderful Zelig-like scene has Ted a totally credible CGI creation voiced in a thick Boston accent by MacFarlane appearing with Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show. But even a talking bear becomes old hat after a while and a quarter-century later Ted suffers the fate of many other child stars indulging in major substance abuse while living in the past and mooching off others. Teds main enabler is his lifelong ""thunder buddy"" John (Mark Wahlberg) who at 35 still spends way too much time getting wasted with his fuzzy friend whose coat truth be told is beginning to wear as thin as his act in spots. Johns dreamy girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) is more tolerant of the best friend than John deserves but their fourth anniversary of togetherness cues certain expectations in her that John is not yet ready to offer. STORY Seth MacFarlane and Mark Wahlberg Debut Scenes From Ted Like Family Guy the film serves up cutaway digressions that are hilarious partly for being so unexpected; a flashback to Johns first meeting Lori is cast in the form of homage to the Saturday Night Fever disco dance lampoon in Airplane The fact that some of the jokes sound as if they really belong in the mouth of cartoon characters might have something to do with the fact that Ted was originally conceived as an animated series but the script by MacFarlane and longtime Family Guy writers Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild acknowledges and adheres to traditional structural rules concerning emotional expectations and payoffs; it might even take one step too many in that direction at the close. The film finds its true nostalgic self in the 80s or least in a wildly unanticipated mining of its drugged-out ethos personified by Sam Jones the long-forgotten star of the much-maligned 1980 film Flash Gordon. Just when John has finally chosen Lori over Ted and forced the bear to find his own apartment Ted calls to insist that John join him at a bash with their all-time favorite actor the self-same Jones. The latter parties like its 1980 all right starting by downing shots and moving on quickly to mounds of coke in a wildly frenetic and pretty outrageous sequence topped by an irate Asian neighbors duck pecking the crap out of the obscene Ted. Jones who remains in excellent shape as he approaches 60 is very game and should get a nice little career boost by virtue of his genially gonzo turn. Singer Norah Jones also contributes a nifty cameo as herself freely admitting that she had a thing with Ted some years back and that he was pretty good for a guy without the usual equipment. An uncredited appearance and one so sexually unexpected as to provoke a double and even triple take to make sure its who you think it is is put in by Ryan Reynolds. STORY Mark Wahlberg Attached to Star in The Disciple Program for Universal MacFarlane has a great knack for getting all his performers to be loose and self-deprecating. The banter between John and Ted has a natural working-class shooting-the-breeze style just like the men in Family Guy while the relationship between John and Lori feels genuine and strong enough to make you root for it to work out with Wahlberg relaxed and very appealing as a guy whos postponed growing up as long as he can and Kunis absolutely adorable as his loyal and patient squeeze. Giovanni Ribisi and Aedin Mincks play a creepy father and son who plot to kidnap the stuffed former kid celebrity while Jessica Barth goes the extra mile with limited lines to grab laughs as a vulgar tart whos game for a wild fling with Ted. As did Ben Afflecks Beantown-set The Town Ted sets its unlikely action climax at Fenway Park.
