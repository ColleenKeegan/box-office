If I ever wanted to know what A Christmas Carol might look like as a high-end video game I need search no farther than this motion picture which takes the Dickens classic and converts it into something that looks and feels like it belongs on a PS3. I suspect devotees of the original story are going to be split over this movie. On the one hand some of the visuals are amazing and it remains largely faithful to the source text. On the other hand theres just enough inappropriate humor out-of-place action and animation showiness to give one pause. Theres little doubt that the visual razzle-dazzle usurps the emotional element - you can feel immersed in the world but remain distanced from the characters. Still the motion capture animation is top-notch and its hard not to be impressed with what Robert Zemeckis has wrought even if theres the occasional sense hes pandering to an audience that cant get through a 90 minute story without a few yuks and a chase sequence. When it comes to Christmas stories none is more ubiquitous than A Christmas Carol which has been adapted in just about every imaginable permutation. The two most beloved are arguably the 1951 version starring Alistair Sim and the 1984 made-for-TV one with George C. Scott. According to IMDb the first time A Christmas Carol reached the screen was in 1901. Since then there have been countless ""straight"" editions a musical with Albert Finney (1970s Scrooge) a parody with Bill Murray (1988s Scrooged) and even a loose romantic comedy adaptation earlier this year (Ghosts of Girlfriends Past). Patrick Stewart has done a fabulous one-man stage show. The Muppets have gotten into the act as have Mickey Mouse Mister Magoo and The Flintstones. And dozens of TV shows have used A Christmas Carol as the skeleton for a seasonal episode. So although Robert Zemeckis use of motion capture may be the first to apply this technique to Scrooge and company he has entered a very very crowded field. For anyone who improbably doesnt know the story here it is in a nutshell Money lender Ebenezer Scrooge (Jim Carrey) is the most miserly of skinflints - he complains about giving his clerk Bob Cratchit (Gary Oldman) a paid day off for Christmas. When it comes to celebrating the holiday his one-word refrain spoken to his nephew Fred (Colin Firth) say it all Humbug One Christmas Eve however he receives four supernatural visitors whose goal is to affect a fundamental change in Scrooge. The first ghost is that of his old business partner Jacob Marley (Oldman) now seven years dead. He arrives weighed down by the chains forged through long years of coldness and avarice. Next to arrive is the Ghost of Christmas Past (Carrey) who takes Scrooge on a tour of the Christmases of his youth. The Ghost of Christmas Present (Carrey) allows Scrooge to glimpse how Fred and Bob Cratchit are spending their day tomorrow. And The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come a voiceless specter points a finger at a lonely tombstone in a bleak cemetery. This is Zemeckis third motion capture animated film and it tops what he has previously achieved with Polar Express and Beowulf. Its available in 3-D but even in 2-D its easy to see that a lot of stuff is rushing by and being tossed at the audience. The figures in A Christmas Carol look almost real - pretty much on par with those I saw last weekend in a new PS3 game Uncharted 2 which once again reminds me of the narrowing gap between high-end video games and animated movies. The voice work is uniformly excellent with Jim Carrey and Gary Oldman essaying a variety of roles and Bob Hoskins Robin Wright Penn Colin Firth and Cary Elwes lending not only their vocal stylings to their parts but their physical likenesses as well. The design of Victorian London is masterful. During the opening credits I felt like I was undergoing an aerial tour of the long-ago city. Of all the great A Christmas Carols this one may be the most visually stunning. The production lacks a certain heart however. It hits all the notes but despite playing them with technical proficiency theres a lack of emotion. I didnt care about Scrooges transformation in this version the way I have in some of the others. Perhaps its because things are a little rushed. Or perhaps because there are some weird interludes like the sequence when a miniature Scrooge sounding like Alvin the Chipmunk is involved in an action chase. I found myself groping for my PS3 controller until I remembered that this was a movie not a video game. Maybe this sort of thing is necessary to keep younger children from becoming restless during what is essentially a character-based story. Then again there are enough disturbing images that its questionable whether any child under 10 should be taken to see A Christmas Carol in the first place. This is as ""hard"" as a PG rating can get. Alan Silvestris music merits a mention; its possibly the most ""Christmasy"" score I can remember incorporating cues from about a dozen popular Christmas carols (in particular ""Hark the Herald Angels Sing"" ""Joy to the World"" and ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"") with his own seasonally appropriate compositions. None of the tunes are anachronistic so they fit with the setting and represent an effective complement to the films impeccable visuals. In the ever-expanding pantheon of adaptations of Dickens beloved story Zemeckis A Christmas Carol is the most technically adept and probably the most sumptuous but its not the most engrossing or endearing. It replaces charm and depth with spectacle and bling. Its far from essential but its also not unwelcome especially at this time of the year when an accomplished version of A Christmas Carol is preferable a half-baked new holiday story. Theres something to be said for the power of a classic even if it has been given an imperfect makeover.

By Dana Stevens After youve seen A Christmas Carol listen to our Spoiler Special discussion on Zemeckis take on this holiday classic You can also click here to download the MP3 file or youll find this and dozens of other Spoiler Specials in our iTunes podcast feed here. A Christmas Carol Robert Zemeckis may have found the way to spend his late career making 3-D motion-capture versions of literary classics that while they threaten to vulgarize their sources wind up remaining curiously true to them in spirit. His adaptation of Beowulf wasnt perfect but it barreled along with admirable energy fueled by Zemeckis notion that the oldest poem in the English language was a predecessor of the superhero comic. With A Christmas Carol (Disney) though Zemeckis (who also wrote the screenplay) treads on more perilous ground. Rollicking though it is Beowulf is known to most of us as a high-fiber offering in high school or early college English classes. DickensA Christmas Carol is one of the most-read and best-loved short stories in the English language adapted for the screen some 20 times (depending on whether youre counting Ghosts of Girlfriends Past) and its iconic phrases--""I wear the chain I forged in life."" ""Bah humbug"" ""God bless us every one""--are as familiar to speakers of English as the 23rd Psalm. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The ominous words ""Jim Carrey as Scrooge"" cause a chill more glacial than a London Christmas Eve to run up a Dickens fans spine. But wonder of wonders Carrey isnt asked to mug pander or prance. He plays the heartless miser straight the already angular planes of his face digitally lengthened into sharp points. Nearly every line of dialogue in this adaptation of A Christmas Carol comes directly from the story. What interpolations there are have to do with juicing up the transitions between scenes with unnecessary but not obnoxiously intrusive action. When the Ghost of Christmas Past (played like all three ghosts by Jim Carrey and rendered as a kind of glowing humanoid candle) takes Scrooge to visit his childhood boarding school the matter-of-fact magic of the story ""They passed through the wall and stood upon an open country road""--turns into a high-speed flight over the rooftops of London with 3-D snowflakes falling in several planes of depth. All this looks very cool and will no doubt keep a few fidgety kids in their seats though parents might think twice about taking non-Goth children to this gloomy Victorian meditation on loneliness poverty and death. Advertisement In between these high-tech hurtlings Zemeckis slows the hectic pace to watch as Scrooge stands by invisible and powerless witnessing scenes from his life unfold. The struggles of Scrooges underpaid clerk Bob Cratchit (Gary Oldman who looks inexplicably adorable rendered in motion-capture) and his penniless but happy family alternate with the old mans memories of his onetime fiance Belle (Robin Wright Penn whos becoming Zemeckis mo-cap muse; she also played the female lead in Beowulf). Scrooges only surviving relative his nephew Fred (Colin Firth) convinces his fellow revelers to drink a toast to the old man whos never once said yes to a holiday dinner invitation. As a willing sucker for Dickens exquisitely calibrated sentimentality I waited in vain for these scenes to strike a false note but the tears welled up just in the spots they always do. Zemeckis may not be the most sophisticated filmmaker ever to take on this story but he has sense enough to stay out of Dickens way. The single best filmed version of A Christmas Carol the 1951 Scrooge starring Alastair Sim (if youve ever watched TV at 2 a.m. on Christmas Eve you know the one I mean) is more leisurely and melancholic than this punchy 88-minute retelling.  But in some respects theyre surprisingly similar. Both treat the tale more as a ghost story than a holiday frolic--and dont skimp on the spooky bits. And both retain Dickens concern with social injustice preserving the scene in which the Ghost of Christmas Present reveals the allegorical figures of Ignorance and Want crouched beneath his robe. Most incongruously for a Disney holiday release thats timed to sweep family crowds into the theater this Christmas Carol remembers that its much-recycled source material is less a childrens story than a fairytale for the middle-aged. The series of affects Scrooge goes through in the course of that Christmas Eve--the sharp pain of nostalgia the regret for irreversible mistakes the sudden realization that life is shorter than one thought--these are not the emotions of the young. How they made it into this Disney adaptation unprettified is a Christmas miracle in itself.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Disneys A Christmas Carol Animation. Starring Jim Carrey and Gary Oldman. Directed by Robert Zemeckis. (PG. 96 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The poster gives pause It says ""Disneys A Christmas Carol"" four words instead of the usual three a bossy corporate possessive staking claim to Charles Dickens story and his turf. Yet this Disney Dickens is altogether different - and altogether surprising. I dont mean the cutting-edge 3-D the performance-capture animation or the soaring breakneck action sequences that whoosh us under and over the streets of London. What I mean is the movies faithful regard for its source material. For all of its loop-de-loop kineticism and newfangled visuals this is in some ways one of the more accurate and authentically gothic ""Christmas Carols"" in a hundred or so years of adaptations. As usual the plot centers on Ebenezer Scrooge the tightfisted crank who bah-humbugs through the holidays and on Christmas Eve learns the error of his ways. In this latest interpretation the great rubber-mugged Jim Carrey embodies Scrooge and the ghosts of Christmas Past and Christmas Present. Hes also credited with the voice of the third but the bony-fingered Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come isnt all that talkative. Gary Oldman does triple duty as Marley Scrooges clerk Bob Cratchit and the hobbled angelic Tiny Tim. With ""Carol"" director and screenwriter Robert Zemeckis who has made three films with the performance-capture technique uses the technology (which digitizes footage of live actors into waxy simulacra) to illuminate the screen with the sparkle and joy of Christmas but with much darker material. Set in the impoverished gloom of Victorian England its both a ghost story and a morality play. Before Scrooge can shed his money-grubbing ways he must stare death and damnation in the face and have a full-on conversion experience heavy stuff for PG. Photo ""(c)ImageMovers Digital LLC.

All R Review Disneys A Christmas Carol 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Zemeckis film preserves much of Dickens original dialogue and detail while amplifying the utter ethereal strangeness of the ghosts. The motion-capture effect always eerie makes everything all the weirder. If some of the animation overdoes it a lot of it is downright gorgeous. Few images this year have followed me home like the Ghost of Christmas Past here imagined as a bright-flamed candle with the face of a child. It flickers. It whispers.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Nov. 05 2009 131PM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 318PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Disneys A Christmas Carol Directed and written by Robert Zemeckis Starring Jim Carrey Classification PG Confined in our personality our nature our genetic prison we struggle to change even as everything around us everything larger than us changes with lightning speed. Often then we feel like the only fixtures in a world of flux. Happily lifes recipe for frustration can be fictions hearty meal and no one prepared it better than Charles Dickens. The classic make-over tale A Christmas Carol says ""Yes we can"" to the possibility of personal transformation. Easily forgotten though is what fuels the change Crooked old Scrooge is scared straight terrified into niceness. Theres a lot of dark magic in this Dickensian Yuletide. To his credit director Robert Zemeckis doesnt flinch from that darkness and hews faithfully to the book. Too faithfully some might think. Kiddies beware because the Disney has largely been excised from this Disney flick. Instead fittingly Zemeckis applies to a story about change our most powerful instrument of change - technology itself. As in two of his earlier films the underrated The Polar Express and the underwhelming Beowulf  he uses the ""performance capture"" technique here where the visuals lie somewhere between animation and live-action. That makes for a happy marriage with Dickens a writer famous for creating flat characters who themselves fall somewhere between fantastic and real exaggerated cartoons one minute and entirely credible the next. This time though Zemeckis has another technical trick up his sleeve - 3-D - and for once the gimmick succeeds. Yes even the math works out a dimension for each Christmas ghost. The proof comes as early as the opening scene. A gorgeous aerial shot takes us giddily over the architecture and the alleyways of Victorian London with the snow seeming to fall right into our goggled eyes. Suddenly theres a plunge down and into the cold of a cramped office where in lieu of snowflakes we get a face-full of Scrooge - his sharp nose and pointed chin are twin daggers his jagged teeth complete the arsenal. Typically directors try to harness 3-D for expansive effects; in these ingenious frames however Zemeckis deploys it claustrophobically to imprison the audience. Like poor Bob Cratchit were hemmed in by humbug and trapped in a cage of meanness bound on all sides by a misers lethal protuberances. Then Jim Carrey clangs shut the door. The performance captured is his and Carrey never allows the pre-transfigured Scrooge to slip into safe caricature. The guy isnt comically nasty; hes truly madly deeply mean. Gary Oldman does similar work as Marleys chained ghost wrapping him up in the very human torment of regret. Marley of course is Dickenss device for introducing another transformation act whereupon the Christmas spirit morphs into Christmas spirits a trio of spectres taking Scrooge on his frightful trip through the Past Present and Future. Drawing on his rubber body and elastic tonsils Carrey plays all three - the first an ethereal candle the next a robust Eric the Red the last simply and ominously a palpable shadow. On the ensuing journey the bulk of the film Zemeckis borrows from other classics too. From Spielbergs E.T.  when rocketing up into the night sky the angular Scrooge is silhouetted against a full moon. And from Swifts Gullivers Travels  when before getting nice Scrooge gets small shrunk to Lilliputian proportions as his narrow future catches up with him. Yet these frames essentially an extended chase scene are a bit of a muddle the one occasion when Zemeckis seems at cross-purposes with himself and the book labouring to brighten its darker grain. But the correction is quick and pointed especially in an unnerving sequence that sees those allegorical twins the children of Ignorance and Want ""crying like a fire in the sun"" their wails punctuated by the steady tolling of a bell then the quiet ticking of a clock - Dickenss socially conscious warning that todays neglected prey will become tomorrows hungry predators. Here the sound is perfectly wedded to the sense. In fact throughout the cast members - including Colin Firth Robin Wright Penn Bob Hoskins - voice their roles well. But the silence too is memorable particularly the silence of that waiting grave. After all its the prospect of an unmourned death that frightens the life into Scrooge - not many Christmas yarns have their climax in a coffin. His redemption is just the brief denouement although most adaptations stretch out the reborn Scrooge and crank up the sentimental volume. Not here. Zemeckis like Dickens keeps it short knowing that too much turkey can leave us cranky and too much time in fiction no less than fact can erode our faith in the ""Change We Can Believe In.""

The 3-D production directed by Robert Zemeckis uses ""performance capture"" technology to blend live performances with computerized images.

Rebranded by the company Walt built ""Disneys A Christmas Carol"" opens today. Directed and adapted for a 3-D retelling by Robert Zemeckis the movie stars Jim Carrey as the hollowed-out soul who is given a redemptive talking to by four ghosts late one Christmas Eve. The agile actor also performs the Ghosts of Christmas Past Present and Yet to Come. Does this entertainment achieve a timelessness beyond its exquisite source material? Not even. Yet theres pleasure to be had and relief in feeling the filmmakers didnt Scrooge it up either. The technology used to render the myriad turns of Carrey and fellow cast members Gary Oldman Colin Firth and Bob Hoskins is called ""performance capture."" And it makes for an at-times zesty addition to a trove of ""Christmas Carol"" works and offshoots. Jacob Marley has been dead as a doornail for seven years when Scrooge is visited by four ghosts starting with his old -- and tormented -- business partner. Oldman performs Marleys ghost as well as Bob Cratchit and his son Tim. One of Zemeckis finer decisions is not having Carreys characters look too much like the actor. His mug is as well-known as his mugging. It would have been a distraction. Instead this minor annoyance arrives with Scrooges cheery nephew Fred performed by Colin Firth and looking just enough like himself to appear oddly squished about the face. Ditto Oldmans turn as Bob Cratchit. He looks just enough as he might in a live-action film to nag the viewer with that ""dont I know you from somewhere?"" frustration. Much of this is an adults lament. Classics refurbished for effects-stuffed 3-D-immersed kids often get the oldsters bah-ing and humbugging. The bells and whistles of pizazz resound. Scrooges long night of the soul has plenty of wild rides. He flies into the past. He hurtles into the future. Zemeckis came under the spell of the technology while making Chris Van Allsburgs childrens book ""The Polar Express"" into a movie. Actors do their peculiar magic wired to and recorded by computerized digital cameras in 360 degrees. A production photo of the working set is as reality-defying as images of an actor working in front of an FX blue screen. If they wanted actors could arrive to set in their skivvies do their work and call it a day. The outcome is not live-action though there are physical charms to it as when the luminous flame the Ghost of Christmas Past does winning little head jukes. Zemeckis who executive-produced ""Monster House"" seizes the countless opportunities for tricks and treats of of a ""boo"" nature. Perhaps thats why the film is being released right after Halloween and so in advance of the Yuletide season in which Dickens parable of greed and possibility is set. Parents of wee ones remember that ""A Christmas Carol"" is fundamentally a ghost story. Doorknobs morph into strange faces. The floors of rooms yawn to reveal a past a present or a future. Many of the zigs and zags are fine and dandy. For instance the snow-globe effect found in the 3-D version of ""The Polar Express"" is lovely if increasingly familiar. But by the final crescendo of action the film starts to feel like a gilding of the lily. Dickens tale of 11th-hour redemption remains the wintry bloom. When Scrooge throws open his window to ask the lad below what day it is tears well up still -- his and ours. The absurd ecstasy of an undeserving man given a second chance and deliriously transformed by that grace still holds sway. Thats a Dickens not a Disney triumph.

Comments click to enlarge A Christmas Carol 2009 Robert Zemeckis applies the 3-D motion-capture animation of Beowulf (2007) and The Polar Express (2004) to the well-worn Charles Dickens tale (19 screen adaptations and counting). The process uses live actors with sensors attached to their bodies and faces so that computers can record their movement and animators can elaborate on it. As a result the characters are often distracting in their near-perfection the facial expressions here are more precise than ever but still not human as if Zemeckis were following a square root into infinity. The real beneficiaries are the more fantastic figures Jacob Marley radiates green light like a glow-in-the-dark monster model and Ignorance and Want the wretched children who emerge from the robes of the Ghost of Christmas Present are fearsome images of Victorian poverty. Zemeckis captures all the storys terror but its pathos has always been the real challenge and it mostly eludes him.

Behold the teeth spaced like Stonehenge the body bent into a permanent comma. This is not the umpteenth remake of ""A Christmas Carol."" Umpteenth we hit around the time Mr. Magoo played Ebenezer S. Now the scoreboard reads umpteen plus a bajillion. Instead of freshening the setting (a la Bill Murrays ""Scrooged"") warming up the chilly tone (alas the perfect title -- ""Marley amp; Me"" -- is taken) or making the miser a fashionista (anybody want the film rights to my 2006 novel ""A Christmas Caroline""?) writer-director Robert Zemeckis whose recent credits include ""The Polar Express"" and the 3-D ""Beowulf"" devises a full-on horror movie. Starring er Jim Carrey. Carrey playing Scrooge and two of the ghosts isnt bad (he is also barely recognizable which is a bonus). But three problems undermine the project. One Rampaging goblins a man being skeletonized a chase with satanic stallions and a plunge into an infernal grave arent what you expect from a family holiday picture. Two The freaky humanoids created by the ""Polar Express""-style animation (real actors slathered with digital effects) create what psychologists call an ""uncanny valley"" that keeps the viewer at a distance of mild repulsion. You dont identify with Scrooge at any point nor is blatant fakery scary. Picture ""The Seventh Seal"" with sock puppets. Or considering all the soft plastic cheeks you may be reminded of Cabbage Patch dolls. Some of the frightening figures are like Austrian marionettes from a particularly severe period and the Ghost of Christmas Past though accurately portrayed as a dwarf child with a flame coming out of its head can be none other than the spawn of the Pillsbury Doughboy and Heat Miser. As in Carreys last effort ""Yes Man"" there is almost zero comedy though this time the choice appears to be intentional. The one play for big laughs is a bizarre newly imagined sequence in which a miniaturized Scrooge does slapstick with an ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" voice. This bit was seemingly thrown in at the last minute or invented for the trailer which relies heavily on it to make the film seem like a comedy adventure. The scene doesnt work (the horror and comedy cancel each other out) and doesnt belong. The third and largest problem with the horror approach How can you make viewers toes curl when every beat of the story is etched in the collective memory as deeply as a high school grudge? (Answer if youre Stanley Kubrick.) As for kids who havent yet paid their first visit to the offices of Scrooge and Marley Zemeckis stuffs their stockings with coal-black gobs of the original 1843 dialogue. (Would you even risk 1943 dialogue on a kid movie?) Waifs and urchins in the audience will be wondering how ""the treadmill"" could be a bad thing. (It was associated with prisons.) And what were ""Union workhouses""? Whats up with lines like ""Let me see some tenderness connected to death or this chamber will forever haunt me""? Zemeckis was determined not to do ""How the Scrooge Saved Christmas"" -- no goofy back story no smarmy one-liners no renaming the character Ben or chimichangas at the Christmas feast. Unless the director was aiming for a Victorian ""Black Christmas"" though he overshot his mark. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Game 6 scores high TV ratings Read Next Game 6 scores high TV ratings Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 71343 How Hillary blew her big moment 38013 Malia Obama skipped the DNC for Lollapalooza 20134 Judge blasts Nick Denton for lying about Gawker stock value Now On Jill and Joe Biden stop traffic on Fifth Avenue Ex-Focus Features CEO thanks company for firing him No pot for Snoop Dogg at DNC concert SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

This StoryDisneys A Christmas Carol Too much spirit too little heartDisneys A Christmas CarolDiscuss Too early for Christmas movies? The umpteenth iteration of the holiday classic -- about the miserly miserable Ebenezer Scrooge and his Christmas Eve redemption at the hands of a trio of ghosts -- gets a manic makeover under the direction of Robert Zemeckis who applies the same motion-capture animation he used to mixed effect in ""The Polar Express"" to create a fable that is by turns antic scary sweet and in the end slightly soulless. In other words its a heartwarmer that doesnt have much of a heart itself. Mostly thats the fault of the animation which renders everything and everyone in lavish (if somewhat cartoonish) detail yet misses that ineffable quality that makes a cartoon character human. Its populated by figures that are halfway between Wii Fit avatars and real people. This despite the Herculean efforts of the voice cast which includes Jim Carrey as Scrooge and the ghosts that visit him and Gary Oldman as Scrooges dead partner Jacob Marley Scrooges clerk Bob Cratchit and Cratchits son Tiny Tim. That the film takes advantage of the latest 3-D technology isnt entirely a bad thing either. The supernatural tale lends itself nicely to the eye-popping special effects in which Scrooge zooms all over England -- and jumps the bounds of the space-time continuum -- visiting not only his own happy past and wretched future but corners of the present day about which he has no clue. In fact the film is at its best when Scrooge guided by a jolly red-bearded Ghost of Christmas Present makes the floor of Scrooges house disappear. The two of them then fly hither and yon peering down into the impoverished dining room of the Cratchit family for instance where the stoic Tiny Tim feels the trickle-down effects of his fathers meager wages (not to mention Victorian-era health care). Just as Scrooge gets a taste of how the other half lives youll feel like youre in some high-tech glass-bottomed boat. And you will get verklempt when Tim raises his cup to say ""God bless us . . . every one."" Not so great is the sequence with the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. Traditionally hes the most starkly terrifying of the ghosts and thats no exception here. Decked out like the Grim Reaper hell scare the pants off most younger kids even as a protracted chase sequence -- in which a hearse pulled by red-eyed hell horses pursues an inexplicably Barbie-doll-size Scrooge through the streets and plumbing of London -- will bore parents to tears. Just because something can be done with computers doesnt mean it should be. Make no mistake. Dickenss story has good bones. And its lesson -- that its never too late to make a difference in someone elses life -- more than carries the day. Despite the Disney imprimatur though parents should think twice about whether to take the very youngest or the most impressionable to this version of ""A Christmas Carol"" which is far and away the creepiest Ive ever seen. When Scrooge is visited by the specter of his late partner Marley the ghosts jaw becomes hideously dislocated and his face splits open. Older kids will laugh. My 10-year-old couldnt get to sleep. Weirder still is the irony that this story -- which is all about the importance of the simple things in life and giving not getting -- is so overwhelmed by what are essentially video-game features. In fact look for it in stores now on the Nintendo DS system.  PG. At area theaters.

Even with its imperfections ""Carol"" is well worth seeing this holiday and next not solely because of its stunning technical achievements but also for Carreys measured performances -- he does eight characters about six of them wonderfully -- and Zemeckis contagious fondness for the story. Parents beware though This more literal version of ""Carol"" will spook the Dickens out the kiddies.Whats especially surprising about ""Carol"" is how the director and star refreshingly temper their predilection for going gonzo a change that allows for the iconic characters and Dickens rich prose to drive the train. Occasionally the manic duo cave to their overblown impulses -- notably when the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Be comes knocking and the action turns way too Road Runner frenetic and loopy for its own good.What ""Carol"" lacks in depth and range for adults it more than makes up for in jaw-dropping spectacle. From snowflakes that swirl so realistically in front of our eyes that you want to reach out and touch one to a camera that zips and bolts over a gloriously re-created London cityscape Zemeckis and company razzle-dazzle us with cutting-edge 3-D.Advertisement Even the quieter moments reveal painstakingly precise production values such as when we enter Ebenezer Scrooges cavernous home a treasure chest of character development with its Spartan look and shadowed walls. The scene is so chilly; you almost feel a goose pimple itching to show itself.Obviously Zemeckis and his team have added more polish to the ""performance capture"" process which digitally animates actors with computerized cameras. The technique remains a work-in-process with key characters unable to express complex feelings. Regardless its a vast improvement over the weirdness of ""Polar Express"" and the goofiness of ""Beowulf.""Nowhere is that more evident than in the form of Scrooge. With his beakish nose slouched back and rail-thin frame the crusty curmudgeon becomes a poster boy for how this process can work so well. (Carrey deserves credit too.) Other characters and actors are impressive except for one pivotal role.With his crutches faltering health and feeble voice Tiny Tims (Gary Oldman who also makes a fine Bob Cratchit) immediate appearance should trigger tears in our eyes. Instead we stare at him and wonder why his eyes look so freaky. Sadly it is this key sequence where we emotionally disconnect from ""Carol"" right when we should getting ready to blubber.But hey arent those 3-D snowflakes cool?""Disney""s A Christmas Carol""H1/2Rating PG (some scary moments with those ghosts)Cast Jim Carrey Gary Oldman Colin Firth Bob Hoskins and Robin Penn WrightDirector-writer Robert ZemeckisRunning time 1 hour 36 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Talend Silicon Valleys latest tech IPO has a strong debutSource Tesla looking at cameras radar in Florida crashCartoons Hillary Clinton makes history Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

"A Christmas Carol Disney dips Scrooge in digital goo | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsLifeA Christmas Carol Disney dips Scrooge in digital gooLike a Shakespeare sonnet or Beatles tune the Charles Dickens perennial A Christmas Carol is hardy enough to survive any abuse.Jim Carrey plays Scrooge as well as the three ghosts in a motion-capture 3-D adaptation of an old story for the high-tech generation but younger viewers may be scared by the spookier scenes.  (SUPPLIED IMAGE)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Nov. 6 2009Starring Jim Carrey Colin Firth Gary Oldman Bob Hoskins and Robin Wright Penn. Written and directed by Robert Zemeckis. At major theatres. PGLike a Shakespeare sonnet or Beatles tune the Charles Dickens perennial A Christmas Carol is hardy enough to survive any abuse.Everyone from the Muppets to Mr. Magoo to Matthew McConaughey have had their way with it sometimes bending the story almost beyond recognition. Yet the essential Yuletide message of redemption and goodwill always comes through.Thats the good news about Disneys A Christmas Carol a movie by Robert Zemeckis that turns a 19th-century morality tale into a 21st-century funhouse ride replete with digital greasepaint and 3-D gaping. Look past all the techno tinsel and the uplift is the same as always. You might even enjoy the 3-D faux snow landing in your lap.Article Continued BelowThe bad news is that all this glitter is not gold. This is the third film by Zemeckis using motion-capture technology the others being The Polar Express and Beowulf and he has yet to prove the worth of a dubious hybrid that is not quite live action and not quite animation.Indeed with A Christmas Carol he comes closest to disproving his own strenuous arguments in favour of the process and 3-D only serves to further gild the lily. Hes taken an immortal story and an A-list cast - including Jim Carrey Colin Firth and Gary Oldman - and nearly smothered them with the digital equivalent of cellophane.Its like taking a Christmas wreath and dipping it in wax or laminating a Christmas card in plastic. Zemeckis risks creating another Yule ghoul the Ghost of Christmas Without Soul. Most people might have judged it sufficient gimmick for Carrey to play not only Ebenezer Scrooge at various ages which he does well but also the ghosts of Christmases Past Present and Yet to Come who vex Scrooge on the path to seasonal enlightenment. Carrey has such an expressive face it seems almost a crime to hide it beneath the mo-cap process in which actors wear dozens of digital sensors while performing and then have their work translated to claymation-style animation. Fortunately for Carrey and the film hes as durable as the Dickens. His personality struggles to get through the digital goo but it largely does although hes much better as Scrooge than as any of the three didactic ghosts.Hes also luckier than Colin Firth Gary Oldman Bob Hoskins and Robin Wright Penn the supporting players in this mainly one-man show who all but disappear behind the digits. Oldman is almost as versatile as Carrey playing the hectoring ghost of Jacob Marley abused Scrooge employee Bob Cratchit and the ever-inspirational Tiny Tim but youd likely only know this from reading the credits.Zemeckis has at least found a way to eliminate the ""dead eye"" problem that made The Polar Express such an unnerving affair. Theres much more life to the characters in A Christmas Carol than previously achieved which is one small consolation if he insists on going forward with mo-cap moviemaking.But he tramples all over the wonderful sound of Dickens sabotaging moments where the ear should be favoured rather than the eye. The scene where Scrooges late partner Marley warns him of the dire consequences of putting profit ahead of charity (""Mankind was my business"") is drowned out by a ghastly face-snapping stunt that looks like a steal from a Tim Burton movie. One that might seriously frighten younger viewers by the way as will other spooky scenes.Zemeckis is also obsessed with motion. He hurtles Scrooge through his Christmas Eve nocturnal encounters with unseemly haste shooting him through the streets of London and even up to the moon. One suspects that the reason the Ghost of Christmas Past is weirdly presented as a candle carrying its own snuffer is not to enhance the story but to enable it to be used as a rocket to send Scrooge on that moon trip.And when did A Christmas Carol ever shrink Scrooge down to size like Alice in Alice In Wonderland? But method appears in this madness. Note the use of ""Disney"" in the title; how long will it be before this film becomes a real thrill ride at a Disney amusement park?In the charity of a season that is approaching all too rapidly let it be said that A Christmas Carol is neither the worst nor the better for this decorous telling of it and it might be just the ticket for people who dont object to digital Dickens or cellophaned Scrooges.Hence the extra half star pushing the rating from ""Bah humbug"" to ""God bless us one and all"" For most film lovers though the definitive A Christmas Carol experience remains the 1951 black-and-white version starring Alistair Sim which requires only a roaring fireplace and a mug of cocoa to push it into a whole other dimension of enjoyment.

Joe Neumaier Thursday November 5 2009 701 PM Title Disneys A Christmas Carol in Disney Digital 3D 3-D animated version of the holiday story. With Jim Carrey. Director Robert Zemeckis (136). PG Ghostly scares. At area theaters. If youre going to make another version of the iconic 166-year-old ""A Christmas Carol"" there needs to be a hook.Unfortunately the latest version of Charles Dickens 1843 novella from Disney and director Robert Zemeckis has a weak one the casting of Jim Carrey as Ebenezer Scrooge as well as two of the three ghosts. While Carreys animated performance as the old miser is serviceable he wasnt born to play him and to be frank audiences werent exactly clamoring for it. (His growly Grinch was quite enough.) And while Dickens message isnt lost this retelling never soars.Thats ironic since the vivid 3-D motion-capture technology thats created Scrooge and company -- the format Zemeckis used for 2004s ""Polar Express"" -- allows for flights above Victorian-era London. Those are big set-pieces that somehow never exhilarate. And ""mo-cap"" comes at a cost Like a dime-store holiday card this ""Christmas Carol"" is well-crafted but artless detailed but lacking soul.The plot -- if it needs recapping -- is simplicity itself Scrooge who hates Christmas a lot and people even more is in need of an otherworldly intervention. On Dec. 24 the ghost of his business partner Jacob Marley warns hell be visited by the Ghosts of Christmases Past Present and Yet to Come. The specters arrive on cue and show Scrooge his youth and future as well as the fate of Tiny Tim the crippled child of his employee Bob Cratchit (Gary Oldman).As the lead character Carreys CG-created body is spindly and bent and he has fun with his vocal performance turning every word into a strangled hiss. Hes less successful as Christmas Past -- a candle with an irritatingly moony face -- and as the burly bearded Christmas Present who here looks like the bloated late-era Jim Morrison.The motion-capture does no favors to co-stars Oldman Colin Firth and Robin Wright Penn since as in ""Polar Express"" the animated eyes never seem to focus. And for all the photorealism when characters get wiggly-limbed and bouncy as in standard Disney cartoons its off-putting.To his credit Zemeckis -- who should get in touch with his inner adult for a change the one who made ""Cast Away"" -- doesnt entirely dumb down the material Yes theres a chase featuring a needlessly miniaturized Scrooge. On the whole though he manages to rein Carrey in. When Zemeckis turns the most haunting scene -- Scrooges sighting of the ragged children called Ignorance and Want -- into a Tim Burton-esque moment the effect is startling but tonally consistent.Scares like that may disturb kids under 7 and thats typical of this Hollywoods first big-screen ""Christmas Carol"" of the millennium. Its neither gravy nor grave as Scrooge might say; creepy but with a family-friendly star at the center. Though not a humbug it likely wont be remembered in six years let alone 166. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Disney By Joe Morgenstern Updated Nov. 6 2009 1201 a.m. ET To put it bluntly if Scroogely Disneys 3-D animated version of ""A Christmas Carol"" is a calamity. The pace is predominantly glacial--that alone would be enough to cook the goose of this premature holiday turkey--and the tone is joyless despite an extended passage of bizarre laughter several dazzling flights of digital fancy a succession of striking images and Jim Carreys voicing of Scrooge plus half a dozen other roles. ""Why so coldhearted?"" Scrooges nephew Fred asks the old skinflint. The same question could be asked of Robert Zemeckis who adapted and directed the film and of the company that financed it. Why was simple pleasure frozen out of the production? Why does the beloved story feel embalmed by technology? And why are its characters as insubstantial as the snowflakes that seem to be falling on the audience? A catch-all answer--and by now an all-too-familiar one--lies in the unnature of that technology. Like ""The Polar Express"" and ""Beowulf"" which were also directed by Mr. Zemeckis ""A Christmas Carol"" employs a motion-capture process that translates the movements of live actors into fantasy images. For its advocates the process is cost-efficient and good enough. For its detractors including me motion capture has become synonymous with a special sort of semi-lifelessness--body language that is vaguely impoverished faces with limited mobility and dead eyes. In the global marketing push for his new film the director has dismissed such problems as essentially solved. But they havent been solved at all; theyve only been mitigated and partially masked by the novelty value of 3-D. Motion capture remains an impediment to capturing emotion. ""A Christmas Carol"" soars only when Scrooge is in temporal transit--one lyrical sequence flies him back to his boyhood village. And some of the action as well as a cataclysmic climax fueled by hellfires and hellwinds will scare little kids out of their little wits. Dickens framed his novella as a moral tale. Disney sells it as a thrill ride--""The Polar Express"" with a really bad Santa. Well its a free country and a public-domain property. Nevertheless you can almost see the various rooms on the Disneyland ride-to-be while the movie makes its way from Victorian past to fun-house future. (Maybe the rides sound design-to-be is why the Ghost of Christmas Present laughs so long and maniacally.) In the turgid stretches between action sequences the drama or whats left of it makes its way with such ponderous self-important artistry that Scrooges present threatens to become an eternity. This sad excuse for family entertainment tries to enshrine a classic while defacing it. Precious ENLARGE Gabourey Sidibe in Precious Lionsgate One of the most telling moments of a shockingly beautiful film called ""Precious"" comes toward the end and its hardly more than a throwaway--the heroine glances at a mirror and sees herself. Until then mirrors have reflected her desperate fantasies of who she might be--a svelte blonde a bejeweled black dancer or cover girl. Thats because Claireece ""Precious"" Jones (Gabourey Sidibe) has found the sight of her physical self--like the plight of her spiritual self--unendurable. A 16-year-old African-American in the Harlem of 1987 she is mountainously obese sexually and psychically abused illiterate almost mute and pregnant with her second child. The drama begins by giving her spirit voice--its another notion of ""A Beautiful Mind""--and follows her growth from a rageful child with a turbulent inner life to a formidable young woman with a life full of promise and hope. The full contractual title of the film which was directed by Lee Daniels is ""Precious Based on the Novel Push By Sapphire."" (Geoffrey Fletcher did the screen adaptation.) In addition to striking a blow for books and the written word the title serves as a reminder that ""Precious"" is a work of fiction by the African-American poet who calls herself Sapphire and something of a fantasy in its own right--an inspirational fable about the power of kindness and caring. (The producers include Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry.) ENLARGE George Clooney below is one of the stars of The Men Who Stare at Goats. Overture Films Thats not to diminish the fables value only to note the near-saintly devotion of an alternative-school teacher Ms. Rain (Paula Patton) and a social worker Ms. Weiss (Mariah Carey) and to acknowledge the time-lapse pace of the heroines blossoming under their care. ""Precious"" is genuinely and irresistibly inspirational. If the filmmaking werent so skillful and the acting werent so consistently brilliant you might mistake this production for a raw slice of life from a Third World country where movies can still be instruments of moral instruction and social change. If Ms. Sidibe werent playing the title role its hard to imagine what ""Precious"" would be. She doesnt play it she invades and conquers it with concentrated energy and blithe humor. (Referring to the sophisticated Ms. Rain and her lesbian partner Precious says ""They talk like a TV channel I dont watch."") And shes not the only spectacular attraction. The comedienne and actress MoNique is stunningly effective as the heroines monstrous mother Mary who makes a mockery of maternal instincts and comes undone in a ghastly confrontation that goes a long way toward explaining her monstrosity. This is a fine movie and a deep one. Its about unearthing buried treasure. The Men Who Stare at Goats ""The Men Who Stare At Goats"" stars George Clooney Jeff Bridges Ewan McGregor and Kevin Spacey. All of them look like theyre having lots of fun and their enjoyment promises to be infectious. After a while though the only sign of infection may be an urge to squirm. You may wonder if this screen version of the book of the same name is as unfunny and strangely mushy as it seems but trust your instincts. Theres no solid ground beneath the story of a secret U.S. Army unit that was dedicated to developing psychic powers. Its a goof about a bunch of goofballs. Jon Ronson the books author said the story was true; ostensibly sane citizens really did try to create a force of American soldiers with superpowers warrior monks who could make themselves invisible walk through walls or as a training exercise if nothing else kill a goat by staring at it. Yet demonstrable truth wasnt the issue. The pleasures of the book came from the craziness of the schemes the fervor of the crackpots who devised them and the steady skepticism of the prose. In the movie which was directed by Grant Heslov from a screenplay by Peter Straughan the two main crackpots played by Mr. Clooney and Mr. Bridges have become arch charmers and the tone is New Age whimsy with absurdist overtones by way of the Coen brothers and Wes Anderson. One of the superpowers under study involves remote viewing via extrasensory perception. I wish I could have viewed this movie remotely or not at all. The Fourth Kind Here are two true things about Olatunde Osunsanmis ""The Fourth Kind."" In the opening scene the actress Milla Jovovich introduces herself as the actress Milla Jovovich which she is--actually she says ""I am actress Milla Jovovich""--and announces that she will play a psychologist named Abbey Tyler which she does. What may be less than true is the actresss announcement that Abbey is a real-life victim of alien abduction and that scenes showing the real Abbey along with corroborating evidence from her terrified patients have been taken from really real documentary footage. Here are five other truths confirmed by the film whose title dares to one-up Steven Spielbergs (close encounters of the fourth kind going beyond mere contact with aliens into abduction by them) 1) Mr. Spielbergs reputation is safe. 2) Jittery hand-held cameras cant create drama only nausea. 3) Mr. Osunsanmis chutzpah exceeds his skill. 4) Mr. Osunsanmi is skillful all the same having made something out of little more than a clever idea in the hallowed tradition of ""The Blair Witch Project"" plus a couple of truly scary moments. 5) In the age of the Internet everything is true unless proven otherwise so ""The Fourth Kind"" will abduct a scary share of this weeks audience. The Wedding Song ""The Wedding Song"" takes place in Tunis in 1942 just as Nazis troops are occupying the North African capital. Karin Albous sensuous leisurely drama doesnt explore the setting so much as draw subdued energy from it. The center of the story is occupied by two girls coming of age in fearful circumstances Nour (Olympe Borval) who is Muslim and her best friend Myriam (Lizzie Brochere) who is a Sephardic Jew. Each girl envies the others life and their envy is equally misguided since the man Nour hopes to marry cannot match her romantic expectations while Myriams religion and the wealthy man shes being forced to marry threaten to be her undoing. A small-scale feature made with modest resources ""The Wedding Song"" seeks and finds larger meaning as a multipurpose parable of the Nazi message of hate that divides cherished friends of oppressed Arabs misapprehending the roots of their oppression and blaming oppressed Jews. The movies distinction however lies in two lovely performances and in the passion and pain of parallel lives--both girls suffering at the hands of men both struggling to understand the brutality of the world they must share. In a DVD recommendation last week I mistakenly said that Leslie Caron won an Oscar for her performance in the title role of the 1953 ""Lili."" The best-actress Oscar that year was won by Audrey Hepburn for ""Roman Holiday."" DVD FOCUS ""A Christmas Carol""(1951) ENLARGE Just in case you were wondering or somehow forgot this is the definitive choice among all the feature versions extant (though I do have a soft spot for Bill Murrays ""Scrooged""). Alastair Sim gimlet-eyed and gleefully acidulous is Scrooge Mervyn Johns is Bob Cratchit Hermione Baddely is Mrs. Cratchit Kathleeen Harrison is Mrs. Dilber and Michael Hordern is Jacob Marley in the flesh and as a ghost. The director was Brian Desmond Hurst. A colorized version is available for those who fancy heresy. For everyone else the black-and-white photography (by C.M. Pennington-Richards) does right by Dickens and puts subsequent shooters in the shade. ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (1977) ENLARGE Sometimes you just have to state the obvious. For all the times its been shown on TV re-released in theaters or repackaged on DVD Steven Spielbergs shining glowing masterpiece will never wear out its welcome. I watch it whenever it turns up and think of it whenever I drive the 405 freeway north from Westwood at night reach the crest of the hill and look down on the San Fernando Valley whose twinkling lights supposedly inspired the design of the films spaceship. Vilmos Zsigmond was director of photography and Douglas Trumbull supervised the visual effects. ""Days of Glory"" (2006) ENLARGE Foreign distributors found a forgettable English title for ""Indigenes"" an unforgettable drama about Algerian soldiers fighting in the French army in World War II. The French title translates to ""natives"" but with a strongly ironic connotation. The soldiers in question dust-poor volunteers from Algeria who had never set foot on French soil fought valiantly to liberate the motherland from Nazi rule. Yet their fellow French soldiers called them ""natives"" or worse used them as cannon fodder and saw them as subhuman scum. The spare sharp-eyed direction was by Rachid Bouchareb who worked from a splendid script by Olivier Lorelle.

"Robert Zemeckis Christmas Carol Bah humbug. Too many special effects - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Special EffectsMOVIE REVIEW Robert Zemeckis Christmas Carol Bah humbug. Too many special effectsJim Carrey plays multiple parts in the motion-capture animated re-imagining of the Dickens classic.November 06 2009|BETSY SHARKEY | FILM CRITIC Have you ever wanted to strangle a ghost?You may well feel the urge after seeing ""A Christmas Carol"" Robert Zemeckis exasperating re-imagining of the Dickens classic as a 3-D action-thriller zooming through Victorian London and the fever dreams of that most miserly of men Ebenezer Scrooge.The ""its better to give than receive"" moral to this story is almost lost under the snowdrifts of special effects. Then there is the blizzard of Jim Carreys theatrics to weather. The actor voices eight characters including Scrooge at all ages as well as the three ghosts who haunt him -- you can just see him in the recording studio pingponging manically around during one of the Scrooge-ghost tete-a-tetes.We wont linger on the story since youve no doubt caught one of the countless adaptations since the Charles Dickens piece was first published in 1843. We meet the grizzled grinch as a bitter old man hovering over the open coffin of his newly dead partner Jacob Marley. The fearsome image morphs from a book illustration into the weirdly life-like look that comes with motion-capture animation.Marley looks ghastly -- chain-rattling ghostly will come later -- as a sinister Scrooge plucks the pence off those sewn-shut peepers. Flash forward seven years and Scrooge is bah-humbugging his way through another yuletide cowing carolers lecturing his lackey Bob Cratchit (Gary Oldman who like Carrey takes on multiple voices including Marleys) rejecting his nephews annual Christmas dinner invitation (Colin Firth who does ""English gentleman"" awfully well) and generally grousing about the season.But we know judgment day is coming when Scrooges goose will be marinated in misery by our three ghostly Christmas cooks.It is here that Zemeckis love of all of his 3-D toys really gets wound up. The entry of the spectral Marley soon followed by the very un-merry past present and future fellows was designed by Dickens to create three stages of introspection for Scrooge. In Zemeckis version they represent the chance to infuse tons of extensively choreographed ""Mission Impossible"" moments -- think of that speeding train in the tunnel recast as a dunces cap that carries a clinging Scrooge on a rocket ship ride through the Milky Way.Which brings us to what the movie is really all about -- the special effects. The film really does work the 3-D application in remarkable ways possibly the best that weve seen from filmmakers almost making the cost of those weird glasses worth it.But the most affecting multidimensional moments are not the blown-out action sequences with this or that tumbling toward you which is what you might expect. Instead its the way you seem to float through the snow and over the rooftops of London the sensation of movement and depth making it feel as if youre perched on the cameramans shoulder as he swings the lens around capturing the city and its citizens from all sides.Within that enhanced perspective Zemeckis drops his ""performance captured"" central characters not really an appealing one in the bunch with the wizardly Scrooge the least likable even his post-ghost makeover doesnt help. The filmmaker has long been fascinated by the possibilities of motion capture which he played with exhaustively in ""Polar Express"" a mesmerizing experiment if you could get past its children-of-the-dead look. Theres a flicker of life in the eyes this time but something creepily Stepford remains.The technology adds an intensity to the experience that is likely to make some parents queasy and some young ones scream or squirm as the things that go bump in the night scurry about levitating through doors exposing the skeletal childlike visages of human want and need hiding under Christmas Presents robes and all the other horrors of a Victorian depression.The dialogue includes lines many of us could recite by rote from watching various tellings of the story over the years (an excellent version with George C. Scott is one of my favorites). Laced in between the familiar is all of Carreys comic business which has a familiarity all its own. Some of the funny bits prove a relief from Scrooges bitterness and the ghosts nasty grudges but like a very long laughing jag by Christmas Present they tend to go on far too long.What are in very short supply though are the central chords of Dickens carol Crachits generous spirit Tiny Tims sad plight Scrooges emotional arc as he finds his humanity. Oh the scenes are there amid the action but they are fleeting. By the time ""A Christmas Carol"" finishes piling its many shiny presents with their many bells and whistles under the tree theres no room left for tears for Tiny Tim.

AP ""A Christmas Carol"" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint You cannot ruin the essence of ""A Christmas Carol."" The example of a man who learns that wealth is not happiness but happiness is wealth is surely eternal. Its been Muppet-ified musicalized and Bill Murray-ed with great success. And yet its possible to wrap Charles Dickens entrancing story in layers of humbug that diminish it. The odious Matthew McConaughey romcom ""Ghosts of Girlfriends Past"" made viewers hold their heads and moan like Jacob Marley. Still the resilient tale survived. Better than that but not as good as the source material deserves is Disneys ""A Christmas Carol."" This is a holiday offering whose gaudy 3D packaging matters more than the old relic inside. Director Robert Zemeckis (the ""Back to the Future"" films ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"") favors thrill-ride effects that are more often the star than the servant of the story. Its like ""Silent Night"" played by Led Zeppelin. In this Christmas fable Scrooge zooms airborne across Victorian London like a cruise missile does skateboard-style slides along an icy rooftop and spends more time falling through the stratosphere than a champion skydiver. Hes shrunk to the size of a mouse and menaced by runaway carriage horses. If there was a way to work a flying DeLorean into the story Im sure Zemeckis would have leapt at it. Its not all razzle-dazzle however. The film uses 3D subtly to add depth of field to the action rather than to jab pokers in your eye and its most effective sections are rather somber. The palette is largely black and gray setting the tone for Scrooges world a place drained of joy. A CHRISTMAS CAROL  out of 4 stars Rating PG for scary sequences and images. Color arrives with the ghosts of Christmas Past (an unearthly beacon of living flame) and Present (a chuckling giant in robes of red white and green). When they convey Scrooge to the festivities at Fezziwigs ball and his nephew Freds Christmas party he literally begins to see the light. When darkness reasserts itself in the fearsome form of Christmas Yet to Come Scrooge is put into the only high-wire set piece that underscores the themes of the story a graveyard cliffhanger where the old miser dangles over a mineshaft to the inferno. Frequently though Zemeckis distrusts the story pushing vertigo-inducing effects that trump substance. Given a choice between Dickens rich prose and theme park razzle-dazzle he goes for spectacle every time. The vocal performances are fine. Jim Carrey makes a delightful Scrooge less the villain of the story than its misguided fool and his three Christmas ghosts are vividly realized. Bob Hoskins radiates hearty good cheer as kindly Mr. Fezziwig though he sounds vocally identical as a greedy tradesman come to loot Scrooges bedchamber. Colin Firth and Gary Oldman are better than fine as Fred and Bob Cratchit. But every voice is more distinguished than the motion-captured avatars representing the characters. While theyre better than the dead-eyed zombies of Zemeckis earlier computer-film experiments ""Polar Express"" and ""Beowulf"" theyre still in the range of Disneyland androids. Why do we need these blurry photocopies of real actors? Have you ever seen a film with Oldman or Hoskins or Firth and thought ""Id really rather see a computer simulation""? (Leave Carrey out of this; hes a human cartoon anyway.) These digital humanoids are less convincing than a man in a creature suit was when playing the unearthly Faun in ""Pans Labyrinth."" Watching this film is like watching an animated diorama in a department store window. And for that you dont need 3D glasses.

ABOUT THE MOVIEA Christmas Carol  out of four Stars Jim Carrey Colin Firth Bob Hoskins Gary Oldman Robin Wright Penn Cary ElwesDirector Robert ZemeckisDistributor Walt Disney PicturesRating PG for scary sequences and imagesRunning time 1 hour 36 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Charles Dickens was hardly a master of subtlety but its hard to imagine he would appreciate this frenetic in-your-face and vapid interpretation of his classic holiday tale A Christmas Carol. SLEIGH BELLS AT THE CINEMA Christmas movies already? While faithful to some aspects of Dickens original director Robert Zemeckis takes a story rich in nuance and renders it one-dimensional more antic than thrilling. The main thing that distinguishes this re-telling is its technique - in 3-D using motion-capture technology. What this means to the audience is mostly a lot of swooping - roller-coaster-style - over and around the rooftops of London. The soaring initially is exhilarating but used repeatedly it becomes monotonous. While the technology may allow for more whiz-bang effects it flattens emotional complexity. One of the main problems with motion capture is how it wrings the life out of faces. Rather than resembling their real-life counterparts characters have an inhuman appearance. Jim Carrey plays several parts Hes Ebenezer Scrooge as well as the ghosts of Christmases past present and future. In the process he runs through a range of accents and attitudes. But lots of acting doesnt equal good acting. As anyone surely knows Scrooge is a nasty miser. He hates Christmas and everyone who celebrates it. In Dickens tale Scrooge is offered a chance at redemption when visited by supernatural forces. The ghosts who visit Scrooge are surprisingly humdrum. Perhaps the most annoying is the spirit of Christmas present. As played by Carrey he spends most of his time guffawing. The film focuses on the fantastical at the cost of narrative depth and character development. Scrooges failed romance with Belle (Robin Wright Penn) was deeply scarring. In this incarnation their heartbreak is rendered as matter-of-factly as a business deal gone sour. A re-telling should either present a resonant or fresh thematic take. This Christmas Carol seems like a pale ghost of Dickens magical Christmas classic. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

Carrey also plays the three spirits.By Carrie Rickey Inquirer Movie CriticPosted November 06 2009As Ebenezer Scrooge (not to mention The Grinch) Jim Carrey aims to put a lump of coal in the Christmas stocking and a lump of emotion in the throat. That he fails is not for lack of effort.In Disneys A Christmas Carol Robert Zemeckis visually immersive but emotionally uninvolving spectacle Carreys performance as the miserly misanthrope is lost amid effects more typically encountered in theme-park and video-game adventures. (P.S. Is it just me or does it also peeve you that the Mouse House claims proprietary rights on Dickens title?)While Zemeckis is scrupulously loyal to the outlines of Charles Dickens ghost story the tone of his relentlessly macabre film is more Halloween night than Christmas morning. (Yes it is rated PG. But the only household in which this rating should be observed is Tim Burtons. For anyone under the age of 10 the experience might be too creepy.)As with his The Polar Express and Beowulf Zemeckis created the characters of A Christmas Carol by means of motion capture. This is the process by which the actors facial and physical expressions are translated onto digital models. Essentially the bone that imparts some human flavor to the animation soup ""mocap"" as motion capture is familiarly known is blended into digitally animated scenes.Yet set against Zemeckis photorealistic backdrop of London circa 1843 the stylized characters seen in the film at best resemble waxwork figures. (At worst Scrooge is wizened and knobby as a potato beginning to sprout.) While the filmmaker taps the considerable talents of Carrey Gary Oldman Colin Firth Bob Hoskins and Robin Wright Penn the end result is meltdown at Madame Tussauds.This despite Zemeckis keen eye for composition and sense for dynamic movement in a film that zooms in out over and through London like the applications enabling Google Earth.I admired the films carefully crafted elements especially its painterly use of flickering candlelight and shadow. But I was unmoved because Zemeckis failed to integrate these elements to dramatic effect.As spectacle the film is not uninteresting. It represents one road taken by filmed entertainment in that A Christmas Carol surrounds the viewer in a 180-degree panorama so suggestive that at some moments I thought the snowflakes falling on the London streets and onto Scrooges top hat likewise were dusting my lap. (Keep in mind that I saw it in Imax 3-D.)Though physically I felt inside the scene I couldnt have felt emotionally more distant. Blame this in part to the mocap process that simulates the human without capturing the human spirit.Zemeckis here is compelled more by his technological toolbox than by the moral conversion of Dickens most famous character. Just as Scrooge would rather live in the dark than spend tuppence on a candle in Disneys A Christmas Carol Zemeckis would rather push the technological envelope than balance effects with story.Lost in Zemeckis whizbang zooms and swoops and ghostly grotesquerie is the evergreen about the man who sees how his stinginess has spiritually deformed him and symbolically crippled others the man who ultimately chooses light over darkness.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Ebenezer Scrooge was born in 1843 but he will never die. Scrooge is indestructible because his story "" long-standing greed and last-minute redemption "" is infinitely malleable. It can be a cartoon a musical a movie or an opera. It can be brought to life by a man or a woman a Muppet or a cartoon character Alastair Sim or Bill Murray. It can even be acted by a motion-captured Jim Carrey. A Christmas Carol (PG) Disney (96 min.) Directed by Robert Zemeckis. With the voices of Jim Carrey Gary Oldman Robin Wright. Now playing in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys rating THREE STARS Ratings note The film contains some scary images ""A Christmas Carol"" "" billed as ""Disneys A Christmas Carol"" in an attempt to assert ownership "" is the latest version of the story. And in some ways for all its newfangled computer imaging 3D effects and big-screen Imax breadth its strangely old-fashioned. In fact at first it seems as if the film has merely stolen its script from the classic 1951 version with Sim. But it hasnt. What it has done much like that wonderful film is not only stick to Charles Dickens plot but use huge chunks of his dialogue. Good idea too. The man was funny. The one thing this film has done differently is use motion-capture a special-effects process in which an actors performance is recorded digitized and then animated. (Gollum that precious ring-bearer in ""The Lord of the Rings"" was a motion-capture job.) Robert Zemeckis who directed this ""Carol"" is the biggest booster of this style. In fact the man hasnt made a movie with live actors since ""Cast Away"" nearly a decade ago; he prefers this hybrid which he has used in ""The Polar Express"" and ""Beowulf."" Like any true believer Zemeckis remains blind to his new loves flaws. As with CGI animation motion-capture is fine for textures and mythical creatures but it fails with people Human characters tend to have glassy eyes and wooden teeth like mannequins come to life. But if ""A Christmas Carol"" survived a very-special ""Flintstones"" episode it can survive this. And it does thanks to the cast. Jim Carrey (who proved with ""Horton Hears a Who"" that hes far more likable off-screen) plays Scrooge and all three ghosts with gusto. Gary Oldman does a nice job with Bob Cratchit (and in an odd bit of versatility with Tiny Tim) though the character is drawn a bit too much like a Hobbit. Then there is Dickens wonderful playful language (the joke is more than 150 years old yet people still laugh at ""Theres more of gravy than of grave about you"") and his crisp details like the party at Fezziwigs the warmth of the Cratchits and the cold future predicted for Scrooge. Zemeckis unfortunately doesnt always trust the tale. He has all these modern tricks in his bag and hes eager to use them. So theres one long pointless scene that rockets Scrooge into outer space and another noisy one that has him shrunken down to a pipsqueak and pursued by a hearse. Its nice of Hollywood to go to all the trouble but honestly Dickens doesnt need the help. As soon as that bit of added nonsense is out of the way the story gets back to basics and what Dickens so artfully wrote. Not surprisingly theres nothing in this new ""Christmas Carol"" that improves on the original. Actually theres nothing here that improves on the 1951 version (itself out at last in a cleaned-up BluRay disc). That movie "" with its I-dare-you-not-to-cry third-act reconciliation scored to ""Barbara Allen"" "" is incomparable. But its also more than a half-century old and that can make it a hard sell to a younger generation. Even if old Ebenezer is immortal he still needs an occasional transfusion of new blood. This new version does that by adding all sorts of bells and whistles "" but never obscuring the lovely holiday carol at its core.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Every generation may get the ""Christmas Carol it deserves from the all-dancing all-singing horrors of ""Scrooge (1970) to the brash comic mugging of ""Scrooged (1988) to the sleaze of the recent ""Ghosts of Girlfriends Past. (The best? All votes for George C. Scott and Mr. Magoo will be counted but anyone who puts in the research knows the 1951 British ""Christmas Carol starring Alastair Sim is numero uno.)How does Jim Carrey fit into this? The early 2000s are a time of relentless technical whizbangery - if Dickens were alive hed probably be tweeting ""Martin Chuzzlewit - so the latest ""Christmas Carol is a thing of bits and bytes. More than that its filmmaker Robert Zemeckiss latest adventure in 3-D motion-capture technology in which live actors are filmed on a stage then ""redrawn with digitized skin and costumes and placed into wholly imagined wonder-worlds.""The Polar Express (2004) was Zemeckiss first stab at the process and the verdict is split between those who thought that was a fine movie and those who felt they were watching corpses at play. If youre of the latter persuasion (I am) youll probably head into ""A Christmas Carol with dread (I did).Shockingly the new film turns out to be very good at times close to brilliant a darkly detailed marvel of creative visualization that does well by Dickens and right by audiences - when its not trying to sell them a theme park ride. This ""Carol isnt for young children (theyll be bored and then terrified). The filmmakers still dont have the eyes right. But rarely has the potential for a new method of moviemaking been so convincingly even breathtakingly displayed.Early on theres a set piece shot (or ""shot since no actual cameras were used) in which Zemeckis shows exactly what the form can do. Scrooge has stepped from indoors into the frigid streets and our point of view lifts into the air and high above a London swathed in a sunny snow-shower then down into an alley where a dog steals a shank bone from starving urchins back above to course over the rooftops swooping through a bustling marketplace before settling once more upon the storklike antihero disappearing into his place of business.The shadows and architectural details are painterly the use of 3-D is intelligent rather than aggressive. Only the extras have a mannequin stiffness even as Scrooge himself is rendered down to the last wattle and mole. The shots not dramatically necessary - on one level Zemeckis and his gnomes at ImageMovers Digital are just showing off - and yet it is since it hints at the vast emotional and temporal spaces through which Scrooge will soon soar.And Carrey? Thankfully he dials it down without phoning it in giving a solid character performance that avoids Grinch-y grandstanding in both voice and body movement. (Only at the very end after Scrooge has had his change of heart do we get a bit of the old alrighty-then.) The script sticks so closely to the Victorian speech patterns of Dickenss original that it may prove a challenge to audiences used to todays dumbed-down dialogue but Carrey bites into the cadences with relish. Imagine a blockbuster where you have to pay attention to whats being said. ""A Christmas Carol eerily adapts its casts familiar features to their characters while lightly fictionalizing them The effect is somewhere between makeup and Photoshop. Scrooge is a crabbed stick figure with Carreys bone structure under a different face. Likewise Bob Cratchit looks like Gary Oldmans malnourished ancestor and Scrooges ebullient nephew Fred is Colin Firth with ruddier cheeks and sensibilities. When the Ghost of Christmas Past - an elfin candle-creature - brings Scrooge back to his youth were startled to meet a Fezziwig with the brio and bounce of Bob Hoskins and a Belle whos a more generic version of Robin Wright Penn.Not all of this works. Try as they may the gnomes continue to have trouble investing eyes with genuine soul. Scrooges amber peepers seem almost completely natural but Bob Cratchit and others look as cross-eyed as Tom Hanks in ""The Polar Express. The less important the characters the less detail has gone into them which at times leaves us in a world of Dickensian clones. Theres something almost metaphysical about this inability to go the final step in creating believable digital humans onscreen. If Zemeckis gets it right someday will he become God?I doubt it - ""A Christmas Carol isnt that good. When the film departs from its source and plays to the audience as in a noisy and tedious chase scene involving a spectral hearse or a bizarre sequence in which Scrooge shrinks down to the size of a chipmunk or when the jaw of Marleys ghost pops gruesomely loose it becomes merely the latest Hollywood gewgaw begging for our attention. The further the movie strays from Dickens the more pandering it seems; the closer it sticks (as in a harrowing vision of two feral children named Ignorance and Want hiding under the Ghost of Christmas Presents robes) the sharper it cuts.Still Zemeckis succeeds in making this much-told story seem almost as fresh as when it came out in 1843 and revived both the authors career and the yuletide tradition itself. As awkward as it can be ""A Christmas Carol finally lets us see what its director sees in the technology that obsesses him.

Share Tweet A digital Scrooge scowls through a digital London in Robert Zemeckis A Christmas Carol a new attempt to warm up Charles Dickens holiday chestnut using state-of-the-art technology. But the results feel like the product of a microwave instead of an open fire. A skilled director long infatuated with technological breakthroughs Zemeckis here makes his third excursion into the animation-meets-live-action world of performance capture. Zemeckis has described the process as offering the ""best of both worlds"" but in A Christmas Carol it feels neither here nor there never multiplying the warmth of human performances by the artistic freedoms of animation. It doesnt dip as far into the uncanny valley as The Polar Express--in which a train filled with zombie kids visited a dead-eyed Santa--nor does it offer much equivalent to Beowulfs paperback-covers-come-to-life thrills. The holiday spirit feels real but the film does not. As has to be expected from a director with Zemeckis filmography A Christmas Carol does have its share of memorable images. Among them a terrified Scrooge inching forward with only a candle as his guide a Victorian London realized in detail right down to the rats and some not-so-comforting ghosts. But the story is so familiar and apart from a couple of obligatory action setpieces Zemeckis renders it with the condensed dutifulness of a Classics Illustrated adaptation. He never makes the case for 2009 needing yet another new version of the story much less one starring Jim Carrey as Scrooge and all three Christmas ghosts. Carrey is more restrained than might be expected as Scrooge but he never feels like the right man for the job. His interpretations of the Ghost Of Christmas Past and Present as respectively a drugged leprechaun and a phantom pirate feel less appropriate. But mostly hes just another not-quite-alive element in an ultimately cold sparkling bauble of a movie. Even Tiny Tim that venerable argument for universal health care doesnt stir much pity. Its easy to feel sympathy for a real boy or a cartoon boy but not an in-between creature whose problems look more likely to disappear with a mouse click than with the intervention of benevolent ghosts.

(Nov. 6) Director Robert Zemeckis captures the fantastical essence of the classic Dickens tale with a 3-D twist. With Jim Carrey Gary Oldman Colin Firth Bob Hoskins Robin Wright Penn Cary Elwes and Fionnula Flanagan. (Nov. 6) (John Bramley / ImageMovers Digital) Roger MooreSentinel movie critic The new Disney A Christmas Carol is another epic achievement in motion-capture animation advancing the art form closer to photo-realism than The Polar Express or Beowulf. Dazzling ornate visuals take us to the snowy London of 1837 swooping over its digital rooftops and down its digital chimneys. Faces take on musculature expression and detail.But like those earlier films and certainly to a greater degree given the pathos warmth and wit of the story A Christmas Carol lacks and needs -- desperately -- that human touch. That cinematic literalist Robert Zemeckis who in Forrest Gump had a character say ""Im going to San Francisco"" and then scored the scene with the pop song ""If Youre Going to San Francisco"" gives us Dickens straight no chaser. He grasps the tone of the Charles Dickens novel (darker than most film versions). He lays out the familiar story beats and even more familiar touchstone lines.""Make some slight provision for the poor...Decrease the surplus population...boiled in their own pudding...Christmas? Bah humbug."" And of course that childs Cockney declaration -- ""Gaw-bless us every one""But as Jim Carrey slings an English accent for Scrooge an Irish one for the Ghost of Christmas Past and a vague Scots one for his Ghost of Christmas Present as his skinnier more curmudgeonly digital self does little Scrooge dances and collapses into grief I wanted to see the real Jim Carrey perform that.And I really missed having the great and real Gary Oldman as Bob Cratchit registering grief at Tiny Tims fate and heartfelt shock at Mr. Scrooges conversion.What Zemeckis delivers is a spooky Christmas Carol aptly released just a week after Halloween. A creepy quiet hangs over the tale of a wealthy miser who is taught the meaning of Christmas by a series of ghosts -- corpses come to life or in the case of the Ghost of Christmases Yet to Come a spectral shadow the literal Grim Reaper come to show Scrooge the error and evil of his ways. The laughs are few and very far between. Carreys Ghost of Christmas Past is a candle and the animated version of the actor goofs around with the idea of ""flickering."" But that begs the question -- ""Why cast Jim Carrey if youre not going to get him to be funny?"" Turning him into Bacchus (the standard way of interpreting Christmas Present) and making him laugh and laugh is no substitute for the playfulness each of those roles allows.The digital avatars for Carrey Oldman (Bob Cratchit) Colin Firth (as Scrooges nephew Fred) and Robin Wright Penn (as Fan and Belle) arent particularly flattering to the actors who are recognizable but given Dickensian features.But by Fezziwig that story still works and tugs at the heart. It would even if each ghosts visit werent scored with overly-suitable Christmas carols.The chilling moments are many as this gorgeous-looking Christmas Carol embraces better than most the novels cautionary and always timely message. When it comes to money love and compassion stinginess is no virtue. You simply cannot take any of them with you.A Christmas Carol Three of five starsCast The voices of Jim Carrey Robin Wright Penn Gary Oldman Colin Firth Bob Hoskins Cary ElwesDirector Robert ZemeckisRunning time 1 hour 36 minutes.Industry rating PG for scary sequences and images.

So indelible is the toasty magic of those twin Dickens films that I have never had much use for any other Christmas Carol -- like say all those family dinner-theater productions (""Judd Hirsch is Scrooge""). So when it was announced that writer-director Robert ? Zemeckis would do a new version for Disney using the same photo-realist motion-capture animation technique that begot The Polar Express and all its eager rubber-faced children (and starring the reflexively ironic Jim Carrey as Scrooge) all I could think was ""Not for me."" How wonderfully wrong I was Disneys A Christmas Carol is a marvelous and touching yuletide toy of a movie and the miracle is that it goes right back to the gilded Victorian spirit of those black-and-white films of yore. From the hypnotic opening shot which seems to travel through every nook and cranny of London without a cut Zemeckis signals that hes made a bold technical leap The faces are now fully expressive the streets and buildings so real you could touch them. Ebenezer with his drooping flesh and coldly fearful eyes is no caricature -- Carrey plays him with scolding sharpness and a plummy deep melancholy -- and his journey unfolds with a classicism that is only enhanced by Zemeckis spangly visual flamboyance. He makes the ghost of Marley for instance a figure of true terror. After this grisly bit of paranormal activity we can see that Scrooges redemption has already begun. A Christmas Carol as Dickens wrote it might almost be about the original case of psychotherapy with the ghosts as shrinks who reveal to Scrooge the dynamic interior forces that shaped him. Zemeckis stages the familiar episodes briskly with more jaunty showbiz than were used to -- he uses Carrey and Gary Oldman in multiple roles -- yet without sacrificing any emotion. The spirits have a spooky majesty (the Ghost of Christmas Past is a disembodied head of flame) and when Scrooges home gets turned into a roving hovercraft with an invisible floor that allows him to stare at his life the sci-fi-ish conceit doesnt distance us. It mirrors the dislocation of a man who is now dreaming with his eyes wide open. Zemeckis does hit one false note dropping an incongruous ""action"" scene into the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come episode. Thats the rare misstep though in a Christmas Carol that left me festive with delight not to mention in dire need of a holiday hankie.

Stuffed with simple souls winning over a stingy misanthrope to the view that life is a box of chocolates even when it manifestly isnt A Christmas Carol is nothing if not a meaty yarn. Its a lot more besides but Robert Zemeckis a cutting-edge animator who hasnt told a decent story since 1988s Who Framed Roger Rabbit? has a tin ear for Dickenss grand moral melodramas or just doesnt care much. What switched him on were the CGI possibilities of Ebenezer Scrooges journey back to the future which Zemeckis has folded into of all things a horror story so terrifying that even my hardened 11-year-old clutched my arm in fright. Or was that me clutching hers?A Christmas Carol is a whiz-bang 3-D thrill-ride with all the emotional satisfaction squeezed out of it. For what its worth the movies performance-capture digital tricks all but abolish the boundary between live action and animation. That gives Jim Carrey sunken into a great beak of a nose and a never-ending chin a chance to show off the full range of his india-rubber body language as he morphs from bent old Scrooge to fresh young Scrooge--in love and not yet warped by want and paternal abuse--and back again to the money-grubbing grinch whos so cheap that he stoops to filch the coins placed over the eyes of his dead partner Jacob Marley (Gary Oldman).But were not permitted to dwell on the old misers past life or his tyranny over poor Bob Cratchit (Oldman again only ruddy and round) or anything you might connect to with feeling rather than sensation. Zemeckis keeps pulling us away to where the action (and the tween-boy market) is at Scrooge in his nightdress hurtling over the rooftops of a beautifully rendered London winter whose falling snowflakes threaten to drift right up your nostrils or skiing down icy streets or tumbling down black holes into the abyss that was is and might be.While hes there hes beaten and bruised dangled and verbally abused for the good of his bitter old soul by Marley who flings chains in our faces and does Freddie Krueger things with his jaw that you wouldnt want to see in a PG movie. To say nothing of the ghosts of Scrooges life passages all flagellating the crap out of him all played by Carrey and none remotely like Dickenss vision of Scrooges own conscience For reasons unknown Christmas Past is whimsically realized as a cunning little critter with a severed head on fire while Christmas Present pitches up as a red-headed manically ho-ho-hoing giant who looks like a cross between Robbie Coltrane and Jesus Christ--at which point the effects team appears to have lost interest for the ghost of Christmas Yet to Come is a drug-store Halloween grim reaper in black sheet and clawed fingers while all the good-guy characters save one (Scrooges kindly former employer Fezziwig an enchantingly tubby eggcup presence is delightfully rendered by Bob Hoskins) have to make do with grimy replicas of the cabbage-patch-doll faces worn by the travelers on Zemeckiss Polar Express.When A Christmas Carol isnt carried away by its own frenzied motion its a ruinously stiff tableau vivant of good folk (Colin Firth wearing a squashed ColinFirth-face phones it in as Scrooges honest-to-God nephew) valiantly toasting the eminence grise in his absence and wringing their hands over the possible demise of Tiny Tim. Granted the priggish tyke is one of Dickenss more cloying creations--had Oscar Wilde not given his bitchy all to chortling over the death of Little Nell hed undoubtedly have sunk his molars into poor Tim a saint so blamelessly Forrest Gump-ish that its hard to resist the urge to club him with his own crutch.Many of Dickenss characters begin as caricatures but the best are so deeply felt so fleshed out and bred in the bone of their creators horrible childhood that they become universalized expressions of our own fears and our need to be forgiven. Zemeckis milks Tims pathos for every holy drop leaving little breathing room for the final chapters most powerful parable in which Scrooge does penance for a life squandered on avarice and acquisition.On the plus side Zemeckis avoids screaming parallels to recessionary villains we love to hate. Scrooge is no Bernie Madoff--hes an early-capitalist accumulator who would have thrown a visiting venture capitalist out on his ear. More to the point though hes a mensch in hiding deformed by an abusive father and by a terror of poverty so profound that it blinds him to the insight that you cant take it with you that wealth should be shared and that life is best lived with others. Thats the message that will make A Christmas Carol live forever as a novel. In Zemeckiss new and far from improved version it comes buried in software.

Shortchanging traditional animation by literalizing it while robbing actors of their full range of facial expressiveness the performance-capture technique favored by director Robert Zemeckis looks more than ever like the emperors new clothes in ""Disneys A Christmas Carol."" Charles Dickens 1843 novella and screen perennial has been retrofitted here as a so-called thrill ride in which Scrooge zooms above the streets of London and rockets halfway to the moon and back only because now he technologically can. But while curmudgeons here qualifying as anyone who might prefer earlier versions of the classic tale will frown bright-eyed younguns will ooh and aah from behind their 3D glasses resulting in bountiful early holiday B.O. tidings for the company that has now incorporated itself into Dickens title. Making his third consecutive feature in the hybrid format after ""The Polar Express"" and ""Beowulf"" Zemeckis seems almost stubbornly committed to the process. In regard to ""A Christmas Carol"" the director has made the point that the tales spectral manifestations and time-traveling nature (it was purportedly the first fictional work to shuttle both backward and forward in time) are ideally suited to being rendered in the latest high-tech fashion. But while its true that the various ghosts and geographically plausible aerial images of the British metropolis in mid-19th-century are arrestingly vivid there isnt a moment when it wouldnt be preferable to see Jim Carrey himself even slathered in old-age makeup as well as the real Gary Oldman Colin Firth Bob Hoskins and the rest of the cast rather than their airbrushed CGI approximations. Even as their vocal performances remain intact the elaborate technique drains the actors of their emotional warmth and expressive nuance rendering every moment obvious and uninteresting from a thesping p.o.v. So tidy are the snow-dusted holiday neighborhoods of industrial-age England here that the only malign element on view is the parsimonious personality of Ebenezer Scrooge (Carrey) who early on is seen pocketing the very coins covering the closed eyes of his late business partner Marley on the undertakers slab. Much of the general plot is familiar Scrooge begrudges his ever-suffering clerk Bob Cratchit (Oldman) Christmas Day off and is so antisocial he refuses a Christmas dinner invitation from his nephew Fred (Colin Firth). The stingy old accountant is surprised by three ghosts who separately present him with emotionally telling snapshots from his own life -- past present and future -- which fill the grumpy old grouch with regret fear and an overwhelming sense of the error of his ways. An excellent moral and an excellent Christmas tale which is why it has never faded from sight through the generations. But then as with ""Romeo and Juliet"" and other imperishables perhaps every generation gets the ""Christmas Carol"" it deserves The postwar British feature starring Alastair Sim was no doubt the best; next came a bloated musicalized post-""Oliver"" version; then in the 80s Bill Murray starred in a hipster ""SNL""-era modernization. In this context it makes a certain sense that the early 21st-century edition is dominated or more accurately dictated by technology; theres no other impulse running through it other than the desire to create shots and pull off effects that would have been impossible or at least prohibitively expensive prior to the invention of CGI the performance-capture technique and the rebirth of 3D. To capitalize upon the latter Zemeckis favors placing objects such as hands or chains in the extreme foreground so as to create a 3D deep-focus effect. Hes also developed many scenes with an eye to moving the camera constantly in relation to the characters and settings keeping editing to a minimum. But given the overall animated patina this doesnt create anywhere near the beauty or excitement that similar moves would in live-action cinematography. Also the diminishment in image brightness by at least 20% when the 3D glasses are put on is quite noticeable. For some the dramatically pointy nose and even more pronounced chin added to Carreys face would be 3D effect enough for any movie. In fact Carreys readings are entirely persuasive and the animated stick-like body given him would make Peter OToole resemble John Goodman by comparison. For fun if not for any urgent artistic reasons Carrey also gives voice to the three ghosts while supports Oldman Hoskins and Cary Elwes similarly do multiple character duty. The animated faces given Oldman Firth and Robin Wright Penn the latter as Scrooges youthful love are particularly bland and featureless neutering them as performers.
