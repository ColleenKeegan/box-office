It cares not at all for scientific accuracy or logic or narrative cogency and its most pressing structural concern seems to be the maximum amount of tension its characters physical attributes can impose on Lycra without their clothes giving up the good fight.Related Story In Tomorrowland the End of the World is Disneyfied All this acknowledged its enormously entertaining thanks to the undeniable charisma of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and the wanton CGI destruction of all of the West Coasts greatest landmarks (in 3-D no less). Johnson plays Ray Gaines a burly Afghanistan veteran who spends his days as a rescue-helicopter pilot for the Los Angeles Fire Department. His soon-to-be-ex-wife (Carla Gugino) has found new love with a gazillionaire architect (Ioan Gruffudd) his daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario) is heading off to college and the now-separated spouses are trying to move on from the death of another daughter Mallory. All is calm until an earthquake of unprecedented proportions forces Ray to go AWOL with a helicopter and rescue his family.Rays plot is juxtaposed with that of Lawrence (Paul Giamatti) a seismologist at Caltech who coincidentally happens upon a new method of predicting  earthquakes approximately five seconds before one comes along that happens to be 50 times more intense than any mankind has ever experienced. As far as timing goes its pretty rough. Still Lawrence joins forces with a local-news reporter (Archie Panjabi) to try and find ways to warn the state of California that the ground is about to fall out from underneath it presumably under the impression that way too late is better than never. If nothing else it adds him to a lengthy list of scientists in disaster movies who predict that Very Bad Things are about to happen (The Day After Tomorrow Dantes Peak 2012 Deep Impact etc).San Andreas for all its lumbering attempts at understanding and explaining something as complex as seismology is nevertheless breathtaking in its simplicity. Ray when told that his ex-wife is currently atop a skyscraper in the middle of an earthquake turns the helicopter around and tells her that hell be right there to save her (if not the thousands of other doomed people in the building one of whom bizarrely is the Australian pop singer Kylie Minogue). Blake is somehow guileless sweet-natured innocent and yet enormously practical in an emergency looting an electrical store a fire truck and a number of empty buildings while trying to get to high ground--with the bizarrely confident knowledge that her father will find her. The obvious bad guy who pretends to be a good guy quite convincingly for his first few scenes turns out to be a real heel after all. And when Ray needs a helicopter (or a truck or a plane or a boat or a parachute) lo and behold he finds one.The primary thrill of the film is in watching terrifying acts of nature pit themselves against The Rock and wither in their unworthiness.The screenplay by Carlton Cuse (Lost The Bates Motel) is perhaps the biggest disappointment only because it seems like such a clunker coming from an accomplished writer. The films extreme succinctness when it comes to dialogue is remarkable even for a dumb action flick ""Lets go get our daughter."" ""Im gonna get you out."" ""People need to know that the shaking is not over."" And yet somehow the whole thing is kind of a blast. The movie takes a sanitized approach to the theoretical greatest mass disaster in American history--there are no shots of bodies floating in the water or even so much as a lone kitten stranded in a tree. Theres no ethical complexity or nuanced storytelling and very few surprises. When Ray finds out Blake is stranded in San Francisco he deprives earthquake-leveled Los Angeles of one of its few rescue helicopters with nary a moments thought. Hes a man on a mission to save his daughter and God help the walls or steel gables or 100-feet tsunamis that get in his way.As Ray Johnson is intensely committed to his heros journey while making the case that hes as stolid and dependable a national treasure as Mount Rushmore. Gugino and Daddario are consistent if unexceptional but San Andreas finds more charm in two brothers with plummy British accents Ben (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) a wannabe architect and a love interest for Blake and Ollie (Art Parkinson) his younger sibling who provides much-needed comic relief. But the primary thrill of the movie indubitably is watching various terrifying acts of nature pit themselves against a 6 foot 5 260-lb leviathan of a human being and then promptly wither in their unworthiness.The secondary thrills are in director Brad Peytons gorgeous sequences of live-action ruin porn. Spoiler It all falls down. But in 3-D seeing the Hoover Dam crumble into obsolescence the Golden Gate Bridge shatter and downtown Los Angeles topple to the ground like a particularly unwieldy Jenga tower is eminently satisfying. Knowing that The Rock is going to do his best to add to the ongoing mayhem and destruction--when was the last time you wrenched a car door off to free a girl while dangling from a helicopter in a narrow precipice after all?--is just the icing on the cake.

Twitter previousChinese Democracy Isnt InevitablenextThe Great White House Goat Chase Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

After Khizr Khan spoke politicians and commentators on most networks said they were moved humbled inspired choked up. (Commentators on Fox did not say these things because their coverage cut away from the Khans for Brit Hume and Megyn Kelly plus a Benghazi ad.)

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

First there was the stinging Sony hacking scandal. And now we have the humbling image of the Hollywood letters themselves toppling to the ground as most of California is pulverized by an earthquake -- make that earthquakes plural -- in ""San Andreas."" If those letters toppling sounds like a pretty obvious image well duh. Everything in ""San Andreas"" which stars Dwayne Johnson and his amazing musculature as a powerful-yet-sweet rescue pilot is obvious over-the-top and occasionally laugh-out-loud cheesy. But really you werent expecting Ingmar Bergman were you? Summers upon us and you could do worse than watch the undeniably appealing Johnson try to save the day while uttering the silliest dialogue imaginable. Plus if you live far from the West Coast theres the juicy schadenfreude factor -- though we can count on the inevitable sequel (""San Andreas 2 Eastward"" perhaps?) to fix that. The movie directed by Brad Peyton declares itself proudly from the start. We begin as a winsome blonde lass drives her car off the road and finds herself dangling on a cliff. Ray Gaines of the LAFD to the rescue. With an easy calm smile Ray (Johnson) finds a way to total his helicopter yet scoop the lass to freedom. But we soon learn that there was one major failed rescue in Rays life that haunts him every day. In fact it destroyed his marriage to Emma (Carla Gugino) who as we meet her is about to move in with her new fiance a smarmy real estate developer named Daniel (Ioan Gruffudd in a truly thankless role). San Andreas movie trailer starring Dwayne Johnson Director Brad Peytons disaster pic opens May 29 2015 Meanwhile Emma and Rays daughter 19-year-old Blake (Alexandra Daddario) hitches a ride to San Francisco with her moms beau and asks why he never had children. Gazing at a plan for his latest skyscraper he says ""I guess I never had kids because I was too busy raising these."" And that dear reader is what we mean by cheesy writing. But then calamity strikes. And we do mean calamity. Anything this movie can do once it does twice no many more times. And so just for example twin earthquakes begin pummeling both Los Angeles where Emma is and San Francisco where Blake is almost simultaneously. This all a huge shock (pardon the pun) to everyone except one man a geologist at Cal Tech Lawrence (Paul Giamatti) who predicts much of the mayhem but cant get anyone to listen. Giamatti brings all his nervous energy but cant do much to liven up lines like ""This is NOT good."" Hes accompanied in many scenes by Archie Panjabi as a TV reporter who if were not mistaken doesnt remove her stilettoes once even when taking cover from the Big One. But back to Ray because while this movie is prepared to kill off thousands of people in seconds it cares deeply as does Ray about those close to Ray. In fact its better not to wonder why this professional rescue pilot is spending the entire film saving his family. Wipe that distracting thought from your brain The Who documentary Lambert amp; Stamp is The One (video review) Mike Scott NOLA.com | The Times-Picayunes movie critic picks one movie each week as the movie to see on The One. Once Ray has saved Emma from a crumbling rooftop in L.A. its up to San Francisco home of the famed Golden Gate Bridge -- er make that former Golden Gate Bridge. Its time to save Blake whos at least lucky enough to have hooked up with a shy-sexy-sweet British guy Ben (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) and his annoying little brother (Art Parkinson.) This rescue mission includes a tandem parachute jump into a baseball diamond. ""Its been a while since I got you to second base"" Ray says to his wife. Yes he really says that. But wait We forgot the tsunami Well its that kind of movie where so much happens that you can forget the tsunami part. But remember you werent expecting Bergman right? So roll with it. Note Jocelyn Noveck of The Associated Press wrote this review. ___________ SAN ANDREAS2 stars out of 5 Snapshot A big-budget 3-D disaster film about a massive earthquake that shatters the California coast. What works The visual effects are nothing if not big -- just what many want from a summer movie -- and the considerable charisma of Dwayne Johnson in the lead role goes a long way. What doesnt The script is pure formula making everything about the film obvious over-the-top and occasionally laugh-out-loud cheesy. Cast Johnson Giamatti Gugino Alexandra Daddario Ioan Gruffudd.

Entertainment Why ""San Andreas"" Killed The Disaster Movie A Los Angeles resident and a Bay Area native discuss what its like watching their respective cities get demolished on-screen. Adam B. Vary BuzzFeed News Reporter Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Los Angeles in ruins in San Andreas. Warner Bros. ID 5860323 Hollywood has been in the mass disaster business since at least the Irwin Allen movies of the 1970s and the genres fixation on capturing massive devastation has even earned it the nickname ""disaster porn."" But San Andreas directed by Brad Peyton (Journey 2 The Mysterious Island) represents a new benchmark in destructive realism. It purports to depict what would happen to Los Angeles and San Francisco if the titular California fault line cracked the state asunder in the biggest earthquakes in recorded history. Below BuzzFeed Senior Film Reporter Adam B. Vary who lives in L.A. and BuzzFeed Film Critic Alison Willmore who grew up in the Bay Area talk about why the films approach to this event left them feeling more disturbed than entertained. View this image > L.A. during an earthquake in San Andreas. Warner Bros. / Via youtube.com ID 5860328 Adam B. Vary Setting aside for the moment that its likely impossible for the San Andreas fault line to create earthquakes of quite that magnitude Peyton treats these seismic events straightforwardly tasking his visual effects teams with rendering them with shuddering rubble-strewn verisimilitude. He wants us to think This is how this could -- how it will -- really happen.Alison as a 13-year resident of L.A. -- basically my entire adult life -- Ive lived with the quiet but persistent knowledge that The Big One could hit my home at any time. And I found watching my home get pummeled during that very event as a form of popcorn-y summer entertainment to be a deeply unpleasant experience. Its as if The Impossible about the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami had opened in May with a splashy red carpet premiere and starred a sprawling cast that included Channing Tatum and a cameo by Rihanna. But I can be overly sensitive about such things. So Im wondering as someone who grew up in California if you think Im getting worked up over nothing? View this image > San Francisco in ruins in San Andreas. Warner Bros. ID 5860334 Alison Willmore I did grow up in the Bay Area which has been pummeled on-screen recently -- San Francisco is in ruins in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and gets trampled by kaiju in Godzilla. But thats nothing compared to what happens in San Andreas in which San Francisco is leveled by massive earthquakes then catches on fire then is hit by a giant tsunami. Los Angeles takes it on the chin as well but man does this movie have it out for San Francisco. I was in elementary school when the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake took place and it definitely evokes some of the footage that looped on TV back then -- especially the freeway and bridge collapses. That said for me this movie didnt take much time escalating from realistic depiction of a disaster to giant numbing CGI spectacle so any actual quake-related fears Ive had most of them revolving around getting smooshed by the crumbling of whatever building I was in faded into the background very quickly.As you said Adam Hollywood has a long history of disaster movies but what irked me about San Andreas -- beyond the way it managed to make even my beloved Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson dull -- is the lousy balance it maintained between its mass destruction and its relatable characters. You mentioned The Impossible a movie that for all its impressive filmmaking and acting also inadvertently suggested that audiences needed a set of white characters in order to care about a Thai disaster. And I felt like San Andreas turned that into a grander screenwriting problem -- in attempting to inject some smaller drama into widescale wreckage it ends up making it feel like California was devastated and millions of people were killed in order to get the Rocks family back together. View this image > Alexandra Daddario in San Andreas. Jasin Boland / Warner Bros. ID 5860340 ABV That disconnect is what was so disquieting to me I think. L.A. has also certainly had its share of cinematic calamity. In 2012 the city literally cracked apart in a fantastical doomsday event; the aliens of Independence Day seemed to relish their plan to lay waste to the city (as well as to New York and Washington D.C.); and I dont think anyone will forget that fateful day in 2013 when a shark tornado took a bite out of Santa Monica. In all of those movies the disasters were so outlandish -- and the acting and dialogue often so enjoyably terrible -- that you would be missing the point entirely if you tried to place yourself inside them. These movies are meant as engines for escapism not empathy.But San Andreas wants to deliver its pulpy fun with scenarios that feel genuinely plausible like getting trapped in a car in an underground parking structure or impaled by falling glass or yes caught in a tsunami. The good-bad elements from other disaster movies were in ready supply -- including Kylie Minogues blink-and-youll-miss-her-falling-out-of-a-building cameo -- but I derived no pleasure from them. The actors played their scenes so straight and youre right the Rocks family drama was so bland that Californias devastation became the only thing worth paying attention to. So I just kept thinking Yeah something like this might actually happen to me. And when things finally did get over the top like the Rock dodging a giant container ship as it crests over the lip of that aforementioned tsunami it just felt that much more callous and hollow to me.Like I said Im sensitive. But Im also trying to figure out which is more frustrating being jolted out of a silly disaster movie because the disaster feels too real or numbly enjoying a disaster movies bloodless PG-13 death and expensive CG rubble because it feels too implausible to be real? View this image > Paul Giamatti and Archie Panjabi in San Andreas. Jasin Boland / Warner Bros. ID 5860347 AW It does feel to me like every other big movie ends with a city getting destroyed these days. San Andreas is a bit of a throwback in that this now happens more often in superhero battles than by way of natural disasters but theres a point where it all looks like the same big pile of wreckage that was artfully created on a computer somewhere. Honestly Im more bothered by the callousness to spectacle this has created in me than the potential exploitation of real resonance in a spectacle meant for entertainment. I remember feeling a jolt of unease the first time I saw Cloverfield and its early scenes evoking 9/11 but I think it ultimately made the movie stronger -- the monster in Godzilla after all began as an embodiment of Japans fears of nuclear weapons after World War II so why wouldnt this creature terrorizing New York recall the terrorist attack that forever changed the city?But the bloodlessness in San Andreas is fascinating. The movie kills off millions of people in California alone. The earth buckles skyscrapers crumble the ocean comes pouring into the streets. But for all the death its dramatically free of dead bodies something that really comes through in a later sequence in which characters navigate a boat across floodwaters that should be just cluttered with corpses. Instead San Francisco looks dramatically empty as if everyone had been neatly Left Behind-style raptured right before the wave hit freeing the movie up to focus on its Alexandra Daddario rescue efforts. (Paul Giamattis professor character does issue a warning but the fuzzy timeline doesnt suggest nearly enough time to evacuate an entire city.) It actually made me think of Avengers Age of Ultron which unlike some other recent comic book-inspired flicks went out of its way in its own city-smashing sequence to show civilians being rescued and ushered out of danger. San Andreas doesnt spare these people but it does make their remains disappear. But what do you think of these halfway measures Adam? Does the abstraction of body count in big-screen destruction like this make it more disturbing or less? View this image > A digital tsunami bears down on San Francisco in San Andreas. Warner Bros. / Via youtube.com ID 5860363 ABV Oh more disturbing so much more disturbing. I mean theres even a disturbing thoughtlessness to this movies outwardly heartwarming story of a family reuniting -- the Rocks character rescues people for a living and yet he doesnt think twice about flying in a rescue helicopter over thousands of people desperately needing rescue so he can maybe rescue his daughter in San Francisco.You know I think youve helped clarify for me why San Andreas put me into such a foul mood. It wasnt just that it reminded me that Im basically doomed; it was that it reminded me how fucked up it is that we treat mass death as a form of frivolous entertainment. Todd VanDerWerff at Vox recently wrote about how superhero movies over the last 15 years or so have increasingly been post-9/11 allegories. But like you noted with Cloverfield disaster porn movies like 2012 last years Godzilla remake and San Andreas also qualify as a kind of twisted variation on the events of that day. But after surviving San Andreas Im not sure I will be able to find much pleasure anymore in such merciless catastrophe.

Comments click to enlarge San Andreas An IMAX 3D Experience Recommended Video Rated PG-13  114 minutes  2015 My resistance to summer blockbusters crumbled like a collapsing skyscraper in the face of this big loud exuberantly destructive movie in which a series of unprecedentedly large earthquakes erupt along the title fault line. Theres nothing novel about the plot--as usual thousands of people must die so that a white middle-class nuclear family on the verge of divorce can come together in the crisis and be healed (luckily for the daughter whos trapped in a chaotic San Francisco dad is a fireman with his own rescue helicopter). If you can tolerate the idiotic story though youre in for an endless succession of hair-raising natural disasters in which the fear of falling or being crushed becomes a constant and no matter how bad things get something worse always follows. Dwayne Johnson and Carla Gugino are the action spouses and Paul Giamatti holds down the expository subplot about a Caltech professor who sees the whole thing coming. Brad Peyton directed. By J.R.

""Its been a while since weve been to second base"" he tells her as they land safely on the field sharing a chuckle after an afternoon spent watching several thousand people be swallowed into the earth. The disaster movie is back. A bloodless and boneheaded orgy of computer-generated destruction San Andreas is the latest work from the visionary director behind Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore. The story such as it is centers around Ray (Johnson) a buff angel sent from heaven to save helpless women who are trapped by in or under heavy things. A former Army pilot who now flies a rescue helicopter for the city of L.A. Ray is in the cockpit of his chopper when he sees a highway implode beneath him. His first task is to rescue his wife downtown--once thats accomplished its off to the Bay Area to retrieve their college-bound daughter (Alexandra Daddario). Lest you think the unprecedented natural calamity wont bring Ray and Emma back together her sleazy new boyfriend is an architect and earthquakes sure do hate architects. Campy but never campy enough and far too numbingly artificial to ever drum up any real suspense or sense of awe the film has a scale thats squandered on visual witlessness. Despite having the destructive powers of God at his disposal director Petyon fails to conjure a single compelling set piece. Instead his movies appeal is limited to whatever charm Johnson can muster from thin air and the genius of seismologist Paul Giamatti who gets to look in the camera and say ominous things like ""People need to know that the shaking is not over."" Sadly you wont feel a thing.

By Anthony Lane Bill Pohlads film tells the story of Brian Wilsons troubled life.   Credit Illustration by Tony Rodriguez How many actors does it take to play Brian Wilson? The answer according to ""Love amp; Mercy"" is a minimum of two. Paul Dano plays him in his uneasy prime--the period of ""Pet Sounds"" and ""Good Vibrations"" at the heart of the nineteen-sixties. The older Wilson two decades on is incarnated by John Cusack who moves across the screen in a stunned and gingerly fashion. Bill Pohlads film hopping between the time zones makes room for extra Brians as it goes. A merry montage near the start shows him larking with the other Beach Boys--carrying surfboards in the spree of their youthful fame. We also get Brian as a kid already looking lost and footage of the true Brian over the final credits singing the lean post-traumatic number that lends the film its title. There must be more Brians out there I imagine calmly waiting their turn. The hazard whenever a story is told in two halves is that one half tends to suppress the other. The problem was acute in ""Julie amp; Julia"" for instance which could have dropped its present-day sequences completely and spoiled us with a souffle of purest Meryl Streep. That is not the case with ""Love amp; Mercy."" We need the before as well as the after not because the vibrations go from good to bad in a simple decline but because chords of exhilaration and distress seem to have echoed around Wilsons head like psalms in a cathedral from way back. ""I hear voices"" he admits in middle age. Asked when he first heard them he replies ""1963."" If there is nothing more eager than young Brian as he checks the timbre of his kettledrums there is nothing more dreadful than the sight of his older self at dinner barking out the precise tempo at which in boyhood he used to get beaten by his father. In more ways than one ""Pet Sounds"" was whipped into shape. The best place to find this mixture of moods is Paul Danos face. Usually gaunt it fills out here into the sort of rounded well-fed American mask that we associate with Charlie Brown and his collapsible smiles. Danos demeanor in movies like ""There Will Be Blood"" lies on the brink of a cringe but there is nothing wimpish in his fine depiction of Wilson and his grin as he gives a mock salute and falls into a pool would not disgrace ""A Hard Days Night."" It was the Beatles of course who helped to jolt Wilson toward the innovations of ""Pet Sounds."" Having heard ""Rubber Soul"" he urges on his fellow band members like a charioteer ""We cant let them get ahead of us. I can take us further."" The guts of ""Love amp; Mercy"" like those of his career are to be found in the studio and the movie is never better than when it shows him sliding bobby pins onto the strings of a grand piano to tweak the tone or forcing a pair of cellists to repeat a passage from ""Good Vibrations""--like a propeller he insists crying ""Ka-ka-ka""--until the rhythm has enough bite. It takes three hours but Wilson gets what he wants. The fact that he is encircled by unfunky types--expert session musicians some in cardigans and ties known collectively as the Wrecking Crew--only compounds the joy of these scenes confirming his impatience with the modish and his manic quest for the new. (The other Beach Boys arent sure. ""Who are you Mozart?"" one of them asks.) Too many music bio-pics breeze over the hard construction work of the creative act as if embarrassed by the taking of such pains. Pohlad to his credit digs in deep. For a film about the Beach Boys ""Love amp; Mercy"" is disturbingly short of fresh air. Its all about boxing in. We see Wilson suffer a panic attack on a plane after which he retreats to the recording studio like a knight to his castle. (When his overbearing father played by Bill Camp turns up there unheralded its an enemy invasion.) No image is more telling than that of a piano planted in a sandpit inside a living room; Wilson sits puts his feet in the sand and picks out a tune. Similarly in later life he gets into a motionless car in a Cadillac showroom and locks the doors. Beside him is a saleswoman Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks). ""My brother died"" he says apropos of nothing. ""O.K."" she says taking things gently. Outside through the windshield lurk his bodyguard and much worse Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti)--Wilsons doctor his legal guardian and if ""Love amp; Mercy"" is to be trusted the monster who ate his soul. Does the film stray too far in this tale of a West Coast Svengali who doled out drugs to his victim like jelly beans? It probably does; a single outburst in which Landy snatches a hamburger from Wilsons lips berating him as cruelly as his father ever did followed by Landys explanation of his duties (""I am the control"") gives us pretty much all we need to know yet there is plenty more controlling in store. Banks has a frailer role than Giamatti--Melinda is an essentially good woman who meets a shipwrecked person and makes it her mission to save him--but she handles it with care never lapsing into the saintly and the rest of this consuming film despite longueurs and moments of trippiness partakes of her benevolence. You feel both moved and exhausted by the distance that Wilson has to travel musically and emotionally before reaching the shore. That makes it I guess a happy ending. But then as one of the Beach Boys remarks on listening to ""Pet Sounds"" even the happy songs are sad. In a busy week for Paul Giamatti fans he also shows up in ""San Andreas"" minus a wig and plus a thoughtful beard. He plays Lawrence Hayes a professor of geo-enormities or something at Caltech who keeps telling us that our planet is about to crack like a piecrust. In particular he warns Californians should be getting ready to hide under the table. Somehow though for all his digital modelling Hayes fails to foresee the advent of the Big One--the earthshaker fated to make millions quail and gawp in disbelief. His name is Dwayne Johnson the only actor who looks bigger than whichever vehicle he just stepped out of and his character on this occasion is Ray. We first become aware of his talents when he tips the hat. Sadly this has nothing to do with white tie and tails. Ray flies helicopters with the Los Angeles Fire Department and to tip the hat means to tilt your chopper to and fro preferably inside a crevasse in order to rescue a blameless blonde. Who would suppose observing Ray at work that he is a soul in torment? His wife Emma (Carla Gugino) is about to divorce him to the dismay of their daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario) and shack up with an architect named Daniel (Ioan Gruffudd) who owns--but being a wuss does not pilot--a private jet. Daniel says that he was too busy raising buildings to raise kids; also he turns out to be a coward. Short of disembowelling a puppy theres not much more that he could do to firm up his credentials. The film directed by Brad Peyton is set at the intersection of the rift in Rays marriage and the far less notable rift that opens up along the San Andreas Fault. Without wishing for obvious reasons to pick a fight with Ray I have to question his whole approach to disaster relief. The man is trained to offer assistance and what does he do when an earthquake hits? He scoops his wife off a crumbling skyscraper in L.A. and they hasten to locate their child who is stranded in San Francisco. Towers tumble citizens are crushed and all that bothers Ray is family bonding. He could have skipped the major terrestrial event and spent two hours in counselling. Worst of all after his chopper is downed our hero--a public servant remember--steals both a car and a boat. What exactly is being held up for admiration here? The boat is required because in the wake of the quake a tsunami rolls up. This is excellent news for the flooded city has a genuinely haunted air like an urban mangrove swamp and also because Johnson in a revelatory scene turns out to act better when hes underwater. He is an engaging presence onscreen with an affable sense of humor but too often ""San Andreas"" flattens him like a human high-rise; the look on Rays face as he wrestles with his feelings suggests that he is trying to recall a foreign phone number. Once submerged however he comes into his own awash with decisive desperation. Do we care what happens to his daughter or to the annoying English brothers who rush to her aid? Nope. The allure of ""San Andreas"" rests entirely on the calibre of its pandemonium savored ideally with a brawling audience on a Friday night. Indeed it is the kind of movie that makes me want to campaign for the serving of alcohol in leading cinema chains--mandatory beer I propose with shots of Jim Beam to toast the dialogue. Most of this is defiantly monosyllabic ""My God"" ""Oh shit"" ""Go go go"" and for Hayes an undeserved ""You did good."" Film not bad. Star is huge. Day saved.

"San Andreas - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire San Andreas Posted by Christy Lemire on May 31 2015 3 Comments Warner Bros. Pictures Rated PG-13 for intense disaster action and mayhem throughout and brief strong language. Running time 114 minutes. One and a half stars out of four. The question isnt whether ""San Andreas"" is ridiculous -- of course it is its a disaster epic about earthquakes devastating California -- but rather how effective is that ridiculousness? Oddly the answer is not very. For a big splashy summer blockbuster about destruction and carnage starring Dwayne Johnson ""San Andreas"" is surprisingly dull. Theres a repetitive relentless sameness to the action without much scale or suspense. A massive quake rocks the Hoover Dam or downtown Los Angeles or middle-of-nowhere Central Valley or the streets of San Francisco. Buildings topple concrete and glass rain from the sky and frightened masses flee in terror. Then a series of aftershocks starts the process all over again. Then the quakes trigger a tsunami which levels everything once more. But director Brad Peyton rarely builds to these moments to maximize their potential tension. A powerful image like a gigantic wave flipping over a loaded cargo ship snapping the Golden Gate Bridge in two as if it were made of Legos doesnt wow us as much as it should. Its just one more event within a litany of mayhem. Peyton who previously directed Johnson in 2012s mediocre ""Journey 2 The Mysterious Island"" smothers all the action in thick glossy globs of CGI to such an extent that theres an emotional disconnect. We are detached from the stakes here; the fact that millions of people probably die and major U.S. cities are decimated feels like an afterthought like collateral damage. The Big One which we in Los Angeles have prepared for our entire lives basically serves as a catalyst for Johnsons character to reconcile with his estranged wife and become a family once more with their 19-year-old daughter. The normally charismatic Johnson is stuck in a ruggedly stoic role as Ray Gaines a Los Angeles Fire Department helicopter pilot. At the films start its clear he couldnt be more capable or commanding at work but his home life is a wreck. His wife Emma (Carla Gugino) has just served him divorce papers as she prepares to move into the Beverly Hills mansion of her new boyfriend a slick and insanely wealthy architect named Daniel (Ioan Gruffudd). Ray had been looking forward to driving his daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario) up the coast to college but Daniel takes over that part of Rays life too by offering to fly her there instead in his private jet. Even before the first hints of a rumble its clear that the earth ripping apart will bring them all back together. But first Ray must commandeer various vehicles in order to swoop in as Super Dad. Its like ""Planes Trains amp; Automobiles"" only with a catastrophic body count. First stop is the roof of a Los Angeles high rise where Emma had been lunching at a luxurious restaurant with Daniels disapproving sister (a barely-there Kylie Minogue). (Peyton does stage a long and impressive tracking shot through the shaky chaos here though.) Then the two head north as a team to find Blake whos trapped in a limo inside the collapsed parking garage at Daniels San Francisco corporate headquarters. (So much for his skyscrapers being structurally sound). But as Paul Giamatiti points out as Caltech seismologist Lawrence Hayes -- the lone voice of reason and a welcome source of beautifully understated melodrama -- the only thing to do in a situation like this is pray. Giamatti is the only person here who finds any subtext in ""Lost"" co-showrunner Carlton Cuses script giving his rather unimaginative lines more gravitas and camp than they deserve. Speaking of camp Johnson gets one brief shining opportunity to showcase his comic abilities when he unleashes a groaner of a pun in the middle of ATamp;T Park the San Francisco Giants home even as the city is collapsing all around him. ""San Andreas"" actually could have used more of that instinct. If nothing else acknowledging its own over-the-top nature provides a much-needed variance in tone. Mostly though this guy is all business. Theres never any concern that Ray wont save the day. Hes The Rock. Hes a behemoth. Although in his quest to rescue Emma and Blake he allows untold thousands to perish even though its like his job to help people. This being a PG-13 movie that aims to appeal to the widest possible audience ""San Andreas"" couldnt be bothered with realistic stuff like suffering. But the film does deserve credit for the strong female characters it offers in Emma and Blake. Thanks to all those years they spent with a quick-thinking and resourceful firefighter in the family they not only know how to keep themselves alive but rescue others as well. A pair of British brothers (Hugo Johnstone-Burt and Art Parkinson) not only survive thanks to Blake but also learn some first aid and emergency response tips. Folks in the audience can learn a little something too. For example The perfectly coifed television reporter (Archie Panjabi) whod been interviewing Giamattis character dashes for the doorway at the first seismic shift. He tells her not to do that -- to get underneath a sturdy table or desk and hold on tight instead. So ultimately this mindless spectacle is most effective in its traces of realism. How groundbreaking is that?

Not only was it full of action and adventure it also had a huge human element to it. I think this is by far the best movie Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson has ever done. Given that alone may not say much but he also has had great showings in the Fast and Furious Series. So taking that into account as well as the fact that at the end of the movie the audience in the theater actually clapped says something. I can think of only a hand full of movies where that has happened. Most recently was Furious 7 which also had Johnson in it. So on your review when you say ""-- but rather how effective is that ridiculousness? Oddly the answer is not very."" I dont know what you are talking about. Did you watch the movie or just take into account the other critics who obviously were in a bad mood when they watched the movie? In any case Im just a avid movie goer that sometimes relies on reviews before I watch a movie. Yet after seeing the movie and then seeing the ratings and reviews on Rotten Tomatoes it made me wonder if I should become a critic. It doesnt require any special skill-set other than paying attention and translating your thoughts and emotions into simple words. I have built not only one buy 3 ""multi-million"" dollar companies I think my next business will be this very industry. I digress I just wish you would have taken the time to write a better review. Respectfully Matthew J Carter Reply June 3 2015  by  Steve Miller     You nailed it more than any other reviewer with 1 paragraph Good job; The question isnt whether ""San Andreas"" is ridiculous -- of course it is its a disaster epic about earthquakes devastating California -- but rather how effective is that ridiculousness? Oddly the answer is not very. Reply July 2 2015  by  JozieLee     First off I love me some The Rock. Ok so now hes Dwayne Johnson but that doesnt diminish his appeal wow-factor and sex appeal. In my mind The Rock has achieved star status equal to Arnold Stallone Willis. The Rock drew me to the box office and that particular movie seat and Im thrilled to report I enjoyed every moment of him on screen. San Andreas is all I hoped it would be - action packed visually energizing and shmaltzy. From the opening scene where the negligent teen driver careens over the the cliff and hangs suspended for seconds before the MASH chopper comes to her rescue . . . to Hoover Dam where Sam tosses the little girl into the waiting arms of Quincy ME . . . to running down the Streets of San Francisco only to find Coit Tower surrounded by a cluster of Towering Infernos. Man this movie rocked. Ok so it wasnt original but I still dont care. Did I care that limbs werent flying thru the air or that no one lay dying in the streets cut in half blood gushing from a main vein? No. I liked the saccharine approach. Did we forget that Emmas ear drum burst and that her ear was covered with blood. Of course. That wouldnt be very sexy. Plus if she was deaf how could she and Ray share their intimate moments over the din of helicopter/airplane/boat noise? Maybe because I grew up watching Annie Get Your Gun and Lil Abner and Star Trek summer movies are all about suspension of reality massive doses of CGI mixed with stolen kisses and a chuckle or two. I LOVED this movie . . . not just because it starred The Rock . . . but because I LOVE The Rock And i enjoyed seeing him starring in a summer block buster. Hes worked hard to get where he is today - entertaining his fans maintaining his signature nice guy persona. Hana hou braddah Dwayne hana hou P.S. While I adore Paul Giamatti his character the seismologist who could predict earthquakes didnt save anyone with his information. The masses still didnt know where to go or what to do as aftershock followed aftershock and no one on the East Coast chimmed in with their plan to deal with the coming wave of destruction. All I gleaned from his character is to duck and cover something I learned in elementary school. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

"Whose Fault Is This? Learning to Like the Mega-quakes in San Andreas and the Sloppiness of Aloha << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Whose Fault Is This? Learning to Like the Mega-quakes in San Andreas and the Sloppiness of Aloha Warner Bros. Movies May 29 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print San Andreas has the same kind of preposterousness as its super-quakes You dont want to be crushed by a flying shipping container but what choice do you have? My brain ran for its life until it could run no more having been fully concussed by action ""plot"" and well-filled scoop-neck tank tops. You want to be better than this movie and you are. But when Dwayne Johnson and Carla Gugino are piloting a speedboat up the belly of a tsunami swerving out of the way of the ship from Captain Phillips all you can think is what and wheeeee and phew. ""Better"" feels pretty dumb. The earth of San Andreas cleaves itself open to us like the devils sunroof. Who are we not to leap into the void? This is a movie that in less than two hours merrily undoes almost every item on the U.S. Geological Surveys Earthquake Facts amp; Earthquake Fantasy page. For instance An earthquake on the San Andreas fault can cause a large tsunami. The USGS says hell no ""The San Andreas fault cannot create a big tsunami like the ones that happened in Sumatra in 2004 or Japan in 2011. Those earthquakes happened on subduction zone faults on which ... "" Blah blah blah counters San Andreas. The movie reserves its most prurient destruction for San Francisco where Im sure the filmmakers think subduction is a culinary trend gay bar or type of yoga -- or all three. In any case nobody involved cares about what earthquakes are or arent. They are something to behold especially in 3-D which the movie puts to relatively tasteful good use. So whats our story? This being a disaster movie you get a bunch. At the California Institute of Technology Dr. Paul Giamatti labors on an earthquake prediction model that his partner Dr. Kim Park (Will Yun Lee) has a hunch might be working. [You can totally hear the USGS Um guys ... ] They run off to the Hoover Dam where a cluster of tiny quakes turns into the Big One wrecking the dam and devouring Dr. Kim. Devastated Giamatti somehow gets back to his office in Pasadena and uses a news reporter (Archie Punjabi) to warn the world that this thing isnt over and is headed for the East Coast. [USGS Come on. Seriously?] Meanwhile Chief Ray Gaines (Johnson) saves lives as a Los Angeles Fire Department helicopter-rescue pilot. He had plans to drive his allegedly teenaged daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario) to a volleyball tournament in the Bay Area. But hes got to go to Nevada to deal with the dam which super-well-adjusted Blake is cool with. Anyway his divorce papers just came in the mail and hes sad having just run a hand over some old family photos of a trip to San Francisco which happened before their other daughter died in what flashbacks reveal to be some kind of whitewater rafting disaster that he couldnt stop. Now his ex Emma (Gugino) and Blake are moving in with Emmas new beau a businessman named Dan Riddick (Ioan Gruffudd living up to the ""dick"" part). Chief Ray is furious that he has to find this out from Dan who also boasts that hell take Blake to the tournament. And he does -- in a private jet. [USGS OK not our business here but are you kidding with this?] On his way to take the chopper for a tune-up before he heads to Nevada Ray calls Emma and apologizes for being mad. [USGS Hey is the dam an emergency or what?] He phones just in time -- not because the earthquake destroys the top-floor restaurant where Emma is lunching but because her lunch date is an icy bitch played by Kylie Minogue whos having a good time giving a terrible performance. (Her exit is the movies most wittily awful.) Ray flies over to pick Emma up from the collapsing skyscraper. But considering all the leaping and running and climbing that a very fit Gugino does he may as well be fetching her from the gym. Ordinarily Chief Ray would totally be headed for a Taken movie in which Dan would be a sex trafficker or a terrorist. Here in an earthquake movie hes the next best thing a real estate developer. On the flight up to San Francisco Blake asks why he doesnt have kids. I do he says and instead of adding ""You Blake"" he presents her with property brochures. [USGS Its us again. Forget it. This is amazing.] While hes upstairs doing deals she waits in the lobby and endures the timid advances of a mushy British guy named Ben (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) whos looking for a job with Dan. Hes so wobbly that she and his little brother Ollie (Art Parkinson) have to practically show him how to hit on her. When they wind up fleeing falling debris and weathering more quakes together Blake also has to show this pile of tears and fears how to survive. The depiction of British wimpiness is so vivid and unrelenting that it makes Magic Negro and Sassy Latina seem as noble as White Savior. (Gruffudd is Welsh doing another iffy American accent.) At some point poor Ollie says to pathetic Ben ""Blakes going to die isnt she?"" Its as if the films writer Carlton Cuse were trolling John Oliver to mock-identify with the accuracy of the depiction. Ben gets a girl whom he seems constitutionally incapable of saving. When he tries to smash a window another character waves him away in exasperated despair so that she can do it. Heres another action movie this season after Mad Max Fury Road that turns white men into hood ornaments for vehicles driven by women. (Asians though will still have to wait to put on a cape. The heroics of Lees Dr. Kim are completely self-sacrificing. He heaves a little blonde girl into Giamattis arms then tells her to avert her eyes before the rumbling concrete swallows him up. Lee lasts two early scenes so naturally the costume department gives him the Star Trek treatment and puts him in a red shirt.) Johnson mostly performs daring feats of pretending to drive things into and away from danger. (This guy changes his mode of transportation more often than award-show MCs change outfits. The parachute sequence with a petrified Gugino is my favorite.) Johnson gets to do a couple of borderline embarrassing emotional scenes save some people on the street and when Gugino asks ""What are we going to do?"" say stuff like ""Were gonna get our daughter"" in a tone that makes you think shes been kidnapped. But that line brings down the house in part because it highlights the ridiculousness of the stakes here all this determination trained on one self-sufficient girl. Its all so morally overblown that the movie is shoved into the disaster-movie camp of the Airport films Volcano and anything directed by Roland Emmerich. Really camp is visible right from the opening scene a cheap sub-Jan de Bont/Paul Verhoeven-style gag in which a blondes distracted driving is punished not by an oncoming truck but by rocks loosened by the fault lines idea of foreplay. The movie works at making Blake seem like a daughter worth the effort unlike the Kims of 24 and the Taken movies. What Blake appears to lack in Rays DNA (shes neither brown nor enormous) she makes up for in resourcefulness. Its not a great character but shes not insulting either which is interesting. The movie is a smart kind of stupid. Its 114 minutes whiz by along the way meeting many of the requirements for something like this to work Is the emotional center made of Velveeta? Will actual scientists carp? Does the White House explode or does an airborne cow go spinning across the screen? Yes some version of most of all that happens in San Andreas -- except the last one. A lot of what keeps the movie campy is that it feels oddly cheap. Its several rungs above last summers lousy tornado movie Into the Storm and far beneath the majestic dimensionality of George Millers Fury Road. Theres no standout set piece in San Andreas. Its an album with no single. I remember the boat on the tsunami but vaguely. The movie doesnt really stop to take enough of it in. Michael Bay would have found a way to get 15 minutes from those 15 seconds and the difference feels more like a matter of budget than a director capitalizing on the thrill of concision. The scale of Millers film might be an affront to the credibility of other movies productions. Fury Road seems handmade the stunts done on the spot. The movie is one set piece. Its all vision. You feel it. The effects in San Andreas might be state-of-the-art but theres something amateurish and hasty about the way theyre shot and assembled. At some point Gugino falls several floors and crashes onto a panel of concrete rooftop but you dont get to marvel at it. Its plow-plow-plow lots of dust cut away to her coming to as the sound design simulates her disorientation. Disaster movies dont need vision or filmmaking per se. Indeed the high of these movies -- why theyre better than postapocalypse films (Millers excepted) -- is that theres no time or reason to think whereas with dystopia stories theres nothing else to do. And all that lacking -- of vision of aptitude of acting (the performances here are a house over from those of Sharknado; sorry Kylie) -- compounds the straightforward and backhanded fun. Ive gone this long and havent even mentioned the director. His name is Brad Peyton and he seems to have cribbed from Verhoeven and de Bont and Renny Harlin. The sexy unfurling of an American flag will make Bay leap to his feet and recite the Pledge of Allegiance. Peyton furnishes shots of the unmolested San Francisco skyline that are like a wolfs watering mouth as the predator surveys a henhouse. But whats there left to do for a director on a movie like this? Peyton is making sure everyone meets the height requirement before pressing the button that starts the ride.  Columbia Pictures The weekend was supposed to bring two disaster films the other one being Aloha Cameron Crowes allegedly execrable romantic dramedy with Bradley Cooper as a military consultant in love. Since at least late last year people have been stabbing the movie in the front. Its messy and shapeless and entirely characterized by the grating alacrity of privilege. But its a safe distance from Crowes lowest moments including Vanilla Sky which made money and has its defenders and Elizabethtown which bombed and has virtually none. Crowes idealism needs a suitable home with actors who understand how to play it the way everybody did in Say Anything... and Jerry Maguire and some people did in We Bought a Zoo. I like Aloha the way I like say Steven Spielbergs Always in which the ghost of Richard Dreyfuss gets a hot firefighter to look after his girl (Holly Hunter). Its a minor entertainment thats got stars near the height of their powers. All of this sentimentality should be embarrassing yet its not only that. Aloha asks you to believe for instance that Emma Stone is a quarter Asian. (Daddario makes more sense as the daughter of the Rock.) And the major event that happens in space would have far more dramatic fallout than this one appears to. But charm is a powerful trait in a movie and this movie uses charm as a fragrant disinfectant of both criticism and cynicism which is probably cynical too. If you can get Cooper Stone and Rachel McAdams on the same page it shouldnt matter what youre using to do the creative equivalent of cleaning your house. The plot has the simple-yet-really-difficult quality of a Terrence Malick movie while having none of the artistry. After years away and some trouble in Afghanistan Coopers contractor Brian Gilcrest has come back to Hawaii to do the bidding of a billionaire (Bill Murray) who with the militarys backing wants to launch a satellite into space. Stay tuned for why (then explain it to me). Hes assigned Allison Ng (Stone) a chipper naive Air Force captain to remain at his side. She gets on his nerves and then improbably into his heart. They banter their way into some kind of relationship even as it seems like Brian is still stuck on Tracy (McAdams) whom he once dated. Tracy does high-priority work that necessitates a lab coat has two painfully adorable kids and is married to a cryptic pilot (John Krasinski) whos never home rarely speaks when he is and has a sinking feeling that somethings going to happen between his wife and her ex. All Brian does in this movie is negotiate whether its negotiating over land with a native Hawaiian tribal chief played by the actual nationalist activist Bumpy Kanahele (more or less as himself) or negotiating with the women. You can feel someone trying to shave away some of the films shagginess. Whoever did that missed some spots. But that person has also shorn what I imagine could be construed as filmmaker vanity. Whats left is like a deluxe high-calorie version of NBCs Wings or a show that would run for eight interesting 24-minute episodes on HBO. Otherwise it seems like a movie that someone had to sift for during editing. You get the sense that what the filmmakers were looking for was another Jerry Maguire a film whose earnestness has variety and some edge. Here self-congratulatory do-gooderism predominates in matters of both the heart and nuclear armament. Its like Food Co-op The Movie. You know Crowes not going to bite you (although Alec Baldwin does show up for three scenes as a general whose pot boileth over). What you want with Crowe is for the niceness to penetrate. Youd like to see the sap turn into a more refined sugar. You want lines like ""Your bad moods are unconvincing"" and ""I go hard I go deep and sometimes I break things"" not to send you to the dentist. Barring that someone who can speak Crowes language really helps. McAdams might be the best hes ever had. Cooper and Stone do all the requisite twinkling even though someone here seems to think Goldie Hawn would have been even better in Private Benjamin if Judy were too competent. Cooper has reached his cruising altitude as a star. He makes Crowes droopier dialogue work for him. McAdams puts the perfect amount of air in her lines giving the words a lightness that conflates optimism amusement and resignation. Shes never seemed lovelier more instinctive or more present even though you get the sense there used to be a lot more of her performance. None of this ""works."" But it usually worked on me. Crowe has come up with a couple of good spats and relaxed adult conversations (people talk here; they listen). Its true that Crowes films no longer appear to have much coherent to say. Honestly all I ever ask myself when I watch one of his movies is Why doesnt he just make a musical? Theres a long passage here set at a Christmas party in which Stone and Murray dance to the Gap Bands ""Outstanding"" which is six-plus minutes of mid-tempo heaven. Crowe lets most of the song play out and until Baldwins general cuts it off (for ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"") theres nobody elses mess Id rather be standing in.

By Peter Rainer Film critic May 29 2015 Save for later Saved About video ads About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide Im something of a sucker for disaster movies. ""Earthquake"" ""The Poseidon Adventure"" ""The Towering Inferno"" - bring em on. Im not sure theres ever been a disaster movie that was actually a good movie but thats almost beside the point. The point is to watch things blow up real big.""San Andreas"" doesnt have the accouterments of the genre at its best no cavalcade of slightly over-the-hill stars no scenes of panic in the White House etc. But its a respectable entry anyway. Dwayne Johnson - would it really be so terrible if he still billed himself as The Rock? - plays an active-duty Los Angeles Fire Department search-and-rescue helicopter pilot who once the Big One hits spends much of the movie rescuing his wife (Carla Gugino) who is divorcing him for a ninny billionaire and then mission accomplished saving his daughter (Alexandra Daddario) who is trapped in the rubble that used to be San Francisco. (This part plays out a bit like an apocalyptic version of ""Taken"" with Mother Nature subbing for the kidnappers.) The CGI effects in this film directed by Brad Peyton are quite remarkable and help take ones mind off the cornball disaster-brings-families-together underpinnings. Johnson is stalwart - boy is he stalwart - and the rest of the cast does a good job of mimicking fright while no doubt hollering in front of a blue screen inside a studio. Paul Giamatti plays a Caltech scientist who blows the whistle on the Big One though not with very much lead time at all. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time I do wish the film had played up a bit more how obnoxious these seismologists can be - theyre practically gleeful - when reporting the bad news on TV. And the film ends on an upbeat note that can only be called wishful thinking. If you were hoping for a sequel ""San Andreas - The Aftershock"" youre way too cynical for these auteurs.

Photo Credit AP / Jasin Boland advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A California earthquake epidemic sends a Los Angeles rescue worker searching for his family. Rated PG-13 (mild gruesome imagery). BOTTOM LINE Top-notch effects and a bottom-scraping script make this disaster flick a spectacular bore. CAST Dwayne Johnson Carla Gugino Alexandra Daddario LENGTH 154 Just over 40 years ago California got rocked to the ground in ""Earthquake"" part of a disaster-film epidemic in 1974 that included ""The Towering Inferno"" and ""Airport 1975."" The movies seemed to tap into the decades economic anxiety and pervasive pessimism and they tended to close with someone -- often Charlton Heston -- surveying the wreckage and trying to utter something that passed for meaningful. Not much has changed judging by the new 3-D disaster film ""San Andreas."" Like its 1970s predecessors ""San Andreas"" is basically a prime-time soap set against a cataclysmic event in this case a series of ever-escalating earthquakes. Named after Californias famous fault line ""San Andreas"" has a bigger budget and more megabytes than ""Earthquake"" (which used miniatures and matte paintings) but the payoff remains the same spectacular scenes of devastation chaos and death. advertisement | advertise on newsday Instead of Heston the film stars Dwayne Johnson who as Los Angeles rescue worker Ray Gaines speaks entirely in cliches His very first words are ""Just doing my job maam."" Rays wife Emma (Carla Gugino) is leaving him for wealthy developer Daniel Riddick (Ioan Gruffudd) a story line that goes exactly where youd expect. Rays daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario) is a resourceful type; Hugo Johnstone-Burt plays Ben the smitten Brit who gets her phone number before all hell breaks loose. These characters are so humorless and lifeless that we care less about them than about the doomed buildings in the background. Directed by Brad Peyton almost entirely from a helicopter seat ""San Andreas"" does a fine job of decimating American landmarks (the Hoover Dam the Golden Gate Bridge) but theres no human scale to it at all. Only Paul Giamatti as a Caltech scientist whose worst predictions come true can breathe life into overwrought lines like ""God be with you."" At least one thing has changed since the 1970s -- the terrorist attacks of 9/11. Ever since disaster films and even Marvel films (which have an uncanny tendency to take place in distressed skyscrapers) have felt like cathartic re-enactments. ""San Andreas"" ends with an unfurling American flag and someone uttering a new kind of line that passes for meaningful ""Now we rebuild."" 230 MoviesSan Andreas trailer Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

Photo Jasin Boland/Warner Brothers InA San Andreas San Francisco disintegrates while a disintegrated family is restored to wholeness which the movie presents as a net plus for humankind. Dwayne Johnson and his torso occupy their usual two thirds of the wide screen as an L.A. fire and rescue chief who comes home -- after swinging from a helicopter and pulling a blonde from a car perpendicular to the side of cliff a millisecond before the vehicle plunges thousands of feet into the crevice -- to find divorce papers waiting. It seems that his wife played by Carla Gugino is moving in with a Richie Rich architect (Ioan Gruffud) and bringing along their teenage daughter played by Alexandra Daddario whose luminous blue eyes make her plainly the child of neither of these people. Fortunately for Dwayne the San Andreas Fault cracks along its entire length sending millions of Californians and Nevadans to their deaths and giving him one last chance to prove that he can be more present in his wife and daughters lives. Patriarchal responsibility filial devotion big themes. Dwayne it turns out hadnt been able to save his other daughter Mallory from drowning on a rafting trip which led to the crisis of masculinity that led to the divorce that led to the earthquake (metaphorically). Now he must rescue his wife (still his wife barely) from the top of a crumbling L.A. skyscraper. (Did I mention that much of Los Angeles is also leveled?) Then he must fly with her to San Francisco to rescue their daughter. (Did I mention that the daughter was starting school there? Its every parents nightmare that his or her child will leave the nest and arrive at college on the exact same day as an earthquake of world-historic proportions.) Dwayne and Carlas journey from L.A. to S.F. is the films emotional spine considerably lengthened for a scene in which she muses on what life would have been like if Mallory had lived. Says Dwayne ""Shes gone youre gone whats the point?"" He might have added ""L.A.s gone San Frans gone most of Californias gone ... "" But the ""point"" it emerges is that Dwayne will not lose another daughter to drowning incoming killer tsunami be damned. Americans dont roll over not even when theyre hit by hundred-foot walls of water. Clunky as the movie is I cant laugh off the evolutionary needs to which San Andreas speaks. A child does indeed long for proof that its parent will not run away. A parent rehearses in his or her mind the rescue of a child. There might well be a desire -- rooted in an ancient region of the human brain -- to inoculate oneself against fear by envisioning the worst. There is also Im convinced a more modern yearning to watch a lab assistant gasp ""Professor you need to see this"" and the professor fasten his eyes on the read-out and say ""Oh ... my ... God."" I love that stuff. In San Andreas Paul Giamatti plays the Caltech seismologist who compels his students to hack into a live news feed so he can tell San Francisco (Im paraphrasing) Motherfucking run Giamatti is actually very good -- more credible I think than he is in the upcoming prestige indie biopic Love and Mercy in which he plays Brian Wilsons therapist Eugene Landy as a frothing Rasputin. He hits more realistic complicated notes as a nice guy than a jerk. San Andreas certainly delivers the goods effects-wise although no one over five will buy the part where Dwayne and Carla cruise through downtown San Francisco in a motorboat while managing not to hit the floating remnants of the whole frigging city. The PG-13 rating has the effect of making the most consequential element of the story -- the deaths of millions -- happen tastefully offscreen out of sight out of mind. Skyscrapers buckle highways crumple seas rise metropolises collapse ... But since were mainly concerned with whether Dwayne will sign his divorce papers (as if a divorce court would be in session anytime soon) and Hugo will summon the courage to ask Alexandra if she you know likes him its all a lot of CGI mood music. Though directed by Brad Peyton parts of San Andreas have the distinctively tin-eared vibe of Roland Emmerichs The Day After Tomorrow in which Jake Gyllenhaal nearly drowns in icy waters trying to swim to a pay phone to call his father and say hes okay. (Emmerichs brother Toby is one of the producers of San Andreas.) (Oops turns out Toby is Noahs and not Rolands brother -- though the sensibilities are sibling-close.) Daddario too has a drive to call Dad while buildings collapse all around her. The filmmakers give her an excellent B (maybe B+ possibly A-) story line in which a ditheringly abashed young Hugh Grant type (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) and his wisecracking little brother (Art Parkinson) save her and (this being 2015 when distressed damsels need to reciprocate) are saved by her. And Parkinson has the kind of cutie-freakie physiognomy you can sell as a delightful departure from the norm to talk shows -- his survival here is paramount. But the story isnt complete until Mom and Dad are reunited with Child in a world in which everyone else is an extra. Movies like San Andreas are more enjoyable if after every breathless hairs-breadth cliff-hanger you holler ""WHEW THAT WAS CLOSE"" and do a shot. The film is not when taken in the right spirit un-fun though getting in that right (derisive camp) spirit requires desensitizing yourself to the possibility that the horrors youre watching bear any relation to anything that could actually happen. Having been in both San Francisco for Loma Prieta and New York for 9/11 Ive set a higher bar than some for urban disaster movies. Steven Spielbergs War of the Worlds struck me as a powerful depiction of armageddon as seen through the eyes of a desperate father. And last years spotty Godzilla at least wasted San Francisco with the proper reverence for what was at stake. San Andreas has more mayhem than both of those films combined but its world is utterly disposable. I came away thinking the director had never been to San Francisco. Recently an acquaintance wondered about the larger cultural meaning of so many films in which cities are annihilated. Could this be -- as Brad Birds Tomorrowland argues -- the result of our collective resignation or worse our fetish for apocalypse? Er no. Studios make so many disaster movies these days because (a) the all-mighty Asian market wants them and (b) they can. Because disaster movies are easy. I dont mean ""easy"" in the sense that I could make one or that the artists and programmers who worked on San Andreas arent talented hardworking etc. I mean theyre easy because with CGI miracles are cheap. There are things in San Andreas that no one would have dreamed of seeing 40 years ago when Earthquake (with its tacky plaster-cracking ""Sensurround"") represented the state of the art. But nothing means anything. The spectacle feels less earned than Dwayne Johnsons biceps which are ludicrous but not hollow.A Tagsmoviesmovie reviewdwayne johnsonthe rock Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories John C.

Like watching things crumble? ""San Andreas"" is the crumbliest disaster movie in memory and skyscrapers ball parks and major monuments all get rocked before its credits roll.Its a movie that never lets up and keeps topping itself by elevating its own levels of ridiculousness. By land by sea or by air ""San Andreas"" is a movie that is out to entertain you and deliver a lot of bang for your buck and gosh darn if it doesnt deliver.The Rock er Dwayne Johnson stars as Ray Gaines an L.A. firefighter who specializes in daredevil helicopter rescues. Back on the home front his wife Emma (Carla Gugino) has just hit him with divorce papers as she and their daughter Blake (""True Detectives"" Alexandra Daddario) are preparing to move in with her new boyfriend Daniel (Ioan Gruffudd).Elsewhere we catch up with a college professor (Paul Giamatti) who has just discovered a new method for predicting earthquakes. And wouldnt you know it his readings are off the charts along the San Andreas Fault which runs 800 miles up the spine of California and has long been ready to deliver The Big One.Then the shaking begins. Los Angeles is hit first and though millions of people are at risk Gaines makes it his mission to save just one Emma. Whether or not this makes him a poor rescue worker is irrelevant ""San Andreas"" only has time to focus on a few characters and if we didnt meet them before the quake hit then were not going to at all.Gaines nabs Emma in a daring air rescue and then the two set off to San Francisco together to rescue their daughter because what better to do in the middle of a massive earthquake then set off on a 400-mile road trip. Blake who is a few years past the needs-rescuing-by-her-parents age (Daddario is 28 just 15 years younger than Gugino and 14 years younger than Johnson) is trapped in an office building and attempting to get out with the help of a cute British boy (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) and his little brother (Art Parkinson). Amid the unfathomable destruction around them a love story blossoms because ""San Andreas"" has to hit its marks.At its core theres an endearing earnestness to the movie and the way it adheres to its formula and genre conventions. It makes a point to show the Hollywood sign turn to rubble but it is every bit an old-school Hollywood disaster picture. You can be cynical about ""San Andreas"" but the movie plays it totally straight and its hard not to sit back and let it rock you.There is a crassness to the way the film appropriates 9/11-like imagery especially in the flag-waving closing moments but ""San Andreas"" never pretends to be any less subtle than the Rocks physique. Its a hulking mass of wanton destruction and a stupid-fun carnival of carnage.agrahamdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/grahamoramaSan AndreasGRADE BRated PG-13 for intense disaster action and mayhem throughout and brief strong language.Running time 107 minutes 55 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1HQlN5s MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/05/29/movie-review-rock-california-crumbles-fun-dumb-san-andreas/28095093/,200,sanandreas12,sanandreas,detroitnews

Julia Cooper Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday May 29 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday May 29 2015 1007AM EDT Comments AA Directed by Brad Peyton Written by Carlton Cuse Andre Fabrizio Jeremy Passmore Starring Dwayne Johnson Carla Gugino Alexandra Daddario Classification PG Country USA Language English A necklace with a heart-shaped pendant slowly sinks into deep blue water. An elderly couple clasps each other goodbye not bothering to scramble for survival. The large propeller of a sinking ship rips around in the wind as the stern bobs in the cold ocean. James Cameron is that you? No its Canadian director Brad Peyton whose melodramatic San Andreas bizarrely pays brief but recurring homage to the 1997 disaster epic Titanic. (Theres even a rich jerk who pushes bystanders out of the way to ensure his own safety - though hes got nothing on Billy Zane.) Despite the visual cues that harken back to Camerons box office spectacle there is no doubt that with San Andreas we are in present-day California awaiting a warmer calmer watered-down catastrophe. The fourth film in the Mad Max franchise starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron lands in theatres on May 15. Movie Preview Summer movie preview From Fantastic Four to Poltergeist 19 flicks coming your way The title of course refers to the San Andreas fault line that runs about 1300 kilometres long and whose seismic activity has kept Californians and their home-insurance rates on edge for decades. The twist here is that the fault is even vaster than we thought with an undiscovered segment lying beneath that concrete symbol of Great Depression era perseverance the Hoover Dam. Yet while Peytons film consistently lauds the hard work (and workers) that built America San Andreas lacks backbone. Between its steroidic CGI and emotionally vacant plot line the movie is all flex no muscle.This is especially odd as the film stars Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson that walking talking impossibly charming mound of sinew and bone. The former wrestler plays Ray a Los Angeles rescue helicopter pilot who despite his lifelong career as a first responder just wants to save his family when disaster strikes. Rays daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario) shares his self-reliant streak and evacuation acumen - when the cell towers go out it is Blake who knows what to do. Luddites will high-five here while the rest of us may feel like the film is shaking a wrinkled finger at our dependence on iPhones.In short innovative technology wont save you when the sky falls. It is on this pedantic note that San Andreas chastises the arrogance of Silicon Valleys tech boom and San Franciscos skyrocketing real estate market. The hero is a blue-collar man who labours with his hands instead of in abstractions like ""design"" ""brand"" and ""bitcoin."" His prize is not venture capital but the nuclear family. (Completing Rays family portrait is Carla Gugino as Emma the ex-wife-turned-reunited-love-interest.)Although there have been discussions around the films marketing and release in light of the recent earthquake in Nepal the crisis has had seemingly little effect on San Andreass premiere. Instead the films cloying hashtag WhoWillYouBeWith suggests how we face disaster is a matter of choice. Fortified only by a love of their daughter Ray and Emma approach a series of record-breaking earthquakes and a tsunami as though surviving them is merely a test of their willpower.With this fixation on exceptionalism San Andreas is at odds with itself and slightly anxious. What makes Americans stand apart from the rest of the world has shifted drastically in the past decade. The only nod to the emerging technologies that have shaped the countrys new economy is a hacking scheme that is quickly introduced by a Caltech professor (played by Paul Giamatti because why not?) and just as swiftly dropped.But there is another moment where the film seems to lap up - instead of sneer at - the glitz and bombast of our contemporary moment. On a hunt to find their daughter amidst the mayhem Ray and Emma parachute out of a plane and onto the pitchers mound of the San Francisco Giants stadium. This time the film does not evoke Titanic but rather the highly publicized engagement of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West which took place on that exact spot two years ago. It is as though Ray and Emma are attempting to keep up with the Kardashians and good old-fashioned marriage (not divorce) is the ticket. The scene perfectly captures the films warring sense of what makes the United States (and San Andreas) exceptional - it is glossy and ostentatious but sombre and traditional too.

"San Andreas | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; san-andreas ) San Andreas (United States 2015) May 28 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli San Andreas is exactly what one might expect it to be - no more and no less. Its as if director Brad Peyton (Journey 2 The Mysterious Island) and screenwriter Carlton Cuse assembled this movie after attending a Disaster 101 course. Although technically not a remake of the 1974 film Earthquake San Andreas features many of the same plot points a scientist predicting a quake a Mgt;9.0 tumbler leveling Los Angeles the rupture of a dam and various characters using the cataclysm to resolve relationship issues. Heaving earth fires and floods are all part of the mix but the advances in special effects technology allows San Andreas to provide one of the most vivid depictions to-date of mass destruction. Its an orgy for disaster porn devotees. Although the movie fits effectively into the overall disaster genre it might be worth considering whether real-world occurrences between 1974 and 2015 have altered our ability to enjoy the film as the escapist romp it intends to be. Can anyone watch the collapse of buildings in Los Angeles and San Francisco and not flash at least briefly to 9/11? Is it possible to view the tsunami hit San Francisco Bay (and destroys the Golden Gate Bridge) and not recall the 2004 Indian Ocean event? And with the earthquake in Nepal still fresh do the images of mass destruction take on a different shade? With the nightly news becoming a catalog of disaster images is there room for a hackneyed production like this one? Does San Andreas offer a release from reality or does it remind us of dark events of the not-so-distant past? San Andreas follows two separate storylines that never converge. Paul Giamatti is scientist Lawrence Hayes whose research into earthquake prediction has allowed him to forecast ""the big one"" just as its about to happen. Following the death of a colleague at an event that destroys the Hoover Dam Hayes has been able to validate his methods and the latest data tells him that a two-part disaster is about to unfold in California with both southern and northern epicenters.  After making his pronouncement Hayes spends most of the rest of the movie huddled under a table next to an attractive TV reporter (Archie Panjabi) who has come to the university to interview him. Meanwhile Ray (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) a L.A.-based helicopter rescue pilot finds his plate full once the first quake hits. His first task is to save his soon-to-be-ex-wife Emma (Carla Gugino) from a collapsing skyscraper. Then with her in the co-pilots seat its off to San Francisco to protect his college age daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario). Blake accompanied by her moms cowardly boyfriend Daniel (Ioan Gruffudd) becomes trapped and is left to fend for herself by her companion. Helped by a couple of British visitors Ben (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) and Ollie (Art Parkinson) she seeks a reunion with her Mom and Dad unaware that quake 2 is on its way. Paul Giamatti is perfectly cast as the rumpled scientist and his scenes are by far the most interesting. It causes one to wonder if San Andreas might have worked better if the entire film had focused on his character. The equally cheesy but more entertaining Twister adopted that approach by making its protagonists storm chasers seeking new ways to predict tornadoes. As rescue fireman Ray The Rock is miscast. The film not only fails to make use of his unique talents (he throws only one punch) but expects him to do some subtle emoting thats not one of his strong suits. Carla Gugino and Alexandra Daddario are on hand to provide eye candy with the latter making her first appearance in a bathing suit. Its possible to praise Guginos acting since it consists mainly of expressing shock and awe at images that were added in post-production. Whatever quibbles one might have with San Andreas and the list of problems is a long one (including a bastardization of physics and geography that will give the science community a collective apoplexy) it at least showcases the disaster. Granted all the most spectacular sequences are available in the trailer essentially making it unnecessary to sit through the entire 114-minute movie but at least the films budget is on screen. The central fault in San Andreas structure is a common one for disaster movies with all the attention on the cataclysm narrative and character development are victimized. As a result the world is populated by paper-thin caricatures navigating the devastation. What looks impressive in a 30-second TV spot or 2-minute trailer becomes tedious when its apparent were going to spend far too much time with the humans. And as any porn connoisseur will testify its all about the ""money shots"" not the passages of dialogue in between.

VPCDwayne Johnson and Carla Gugino star as an estranged couple searching for their daughter in San Andreas.(Photo Warner Bros. Pictures)The cleverest San Andreas gets is surrounding a guy nicknamed ""The Rock"" with a heap of falling boulders.Dwayne Johnson and his muscles come to the aid of Los Angeles and San Francisco when the two towns start to shake rattle and roll courtesy of humongous earthquakes erupting along the San Andreas Fault. But the cringeworthy dialogue and unmoving earnestness are the biggest disasters in this mostly forgettable action flick (  out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide).USA TODAYSan Andreas in safe hands with The RockRay (Johnson) is an L.A. rescue helicopter pilot unafraid of jumping out midair to save damsels in distress even when their car is hanging off a cliff. Things are arguably more hazardous on the homefront where he has a rocky relationship with his soon-to-be ex-wife Emma (Carla Gugino); he worries about losing his daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario) to her moms new rich boyfriend (Ioan Gruffudd at his smarmiest).USA TODAYScience a bit shaky in earthquake movie San AndreasAll that needs to be tabled when quakes annihilate the Hoover Dam and then move to California where skyscrapers fall and bridges tumble dramatically. Blake gets lost in the streets of San Fran with a pair of English kids -- one of whom (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) takes a shine to the girl even with broken stone pillars screaming down upon them -- and her parents reunite in order to bring her home safely. (It helps that Ray can drive pretty much anything with an engine.)Paul Giamatti co-stars as Lawrence a noted Cal Tech seismologist and the movies resident science guy that no one listens to about the impending doom. While that subplot is largely inconsequential to the emotional core of the film at least hes there for some of the scenes with true human peril.Alexandra Daddario is trapped in a car and faces various other earthquake-induced dangers in San Andreas. (Photo Jasin Boland Warner Bros.)Director Brad Peyton (Journey 2 The Mysterious Island) spends much of San Andreas running time on massive city destruction but its often a helicopters eye view looking down where humans are like ants simply falling to their fate. The most visceral scenes are when the camera is pointed up with chunks of building tumbling or a huge boat coming over the crest of a tsunami giving the audience a real sense of danger.USA TODAYEarth moves for Daddario post DetectiveIn a town thats short on macho action heroes these days Johnson is probably the only man in Hollywood who looks like he could take on an earthquake and win. There are a few instances of the signature cinematic bravado hes shown in the Fast amp; Furious films and other projects -- a cocked eyebrow here a lighthearted one-liner there -- but its sorely lacking overall.Johnson does what he can with the material though no one is helped by Carlton Cuses ham-fisted script. Many of the lines are met with a thud and the worst of them induce groans and laughs When Lawrence discusses historys biggest quakes in class one student chirps ""Do you think something like that can happen here?""Even for Rock fans and disaster-movie nerds San Andreas is unlikely to move anyone in any real seismic way.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShareTRAILER PARKTrailer Jason Bourne | 219Matt Damon is back as Jason Bourne.

Jasin Boland/Warner Bros. hide caption toggle caption Jasin Boland/Warner Bros. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson in San Andreas. Jasin Boland/Warner Bros. In the Universal Pictures release Earthquake one of the biggest hits (no pun intended) of 1974 The Big One takes a big bite out of Los Angeles -- Gods vengeance the film implies for Charlton Heston cheating on Ava Gardner with Genevieve Bujold. You could expect Moses to be held to a higher ethical standard than the rest of the pictures all-star cast which included George Kennedy Victoria Principal Richard Roundtree as a ""daredevil motorcyclist"" and Walter Matthau as a character identified only as ""Drunk."" The film was the first to be released in Sensurround designed to use low frequencies to create a rumble from the back of the theater. In his favorable New York Times review Vincent Canby said the gimmick ""acts on the eardrums like thousands of angry Magic Fingers."" Sensurround probably felt like a bigger deal 40 years ago than the familiar weightless ka-blammo of San Andreas does now. But the audience that will pay 14 to see the Hollywood sign tip over again and the Golden Gate Bridge once more sundered like a bag of Twizzlers ripped open by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson regenerates every six or seven years; just enough time for an incremental upgrade in computer animation. And thats pretty much the calculus behind the new Universal Pictures release San Andreas The Rock vs. falling rocks which sometimes seem like theyre really there but just as often dont. Helo-flown and hella-dumb the movie delivers what its ads promise and not a particle more Semi-convincing digital erasure of infrastructure. Extremely persuasive bone structure. On the summer movie Richter scale its a 5.0 grading generously. Johnson operating in Stoic Mode here by which I guess I mean that at no point does he lip sync ""Shake It Off"" despite the undeniable synergy of movie and song plays a Los Angeles Fire Department chopper pilot -- a gig in which it would seem that standing 6-foot-5 and weighing a lean-beef 260 pounds would be more a hindrance than an advantage. On this fateful day hes just received his divorce papers from Carla Gugino. (Every action hero needs a failed or foundering marriage unless hes a widower.) I note with approval that Johnson and Gugino are the same age in real life which makes her a cradle robber in Hollywood casting terms. Their college-kid daughter is played by Alexandra Daddario the True Detective supporting player whose face was at the top of all those blog posts about HBOs alleged nudity mandate last year. (She and everyone else stays decent here albeit in the finale soaking wet.) Daddario is only 14 years younger than her movie-parents but manages to pass thanks to the same acting powers by which she convinces us shes in the same frame as the crumbling Transamerica Pyramid. Just look at this trio with their eerily symmetrical mugs. No one ever utters the word ""eugenics"" in San Andreas but its clearly set in an alternate-universe Golden State where selective breeding regulations have been in force for some time. Q Who in this movie wasnt cast for their beauty? A Only perhaps Paul Giamatti who presumably got a genius deferment. He plays a Caltech seismologist who in the wake of a surprise disaster rigs up a pirate TV signal so he can warn the citizens of the state Gov. Schwarzenegger used to refer to as Cal-EE-for-KNEE-uh to expect a second even more devastating strike. ""They will feel this on the East Coast"" he says and its not a pickup line. Even though every last one of his students and fellow researchers are -- would you believe? -- ridiculously hot. The film has other dialogue too; mostly minor variations on the classics ""We gotta go"" and ""Get dowwwwwwn"" and ""DOWWWWWWWNNNNN"" But there is also the more somber and exotic ""It was my idea to take Mallory rafting that day"" because every action hero also must be haunted by The One He Couldnt Save. Subtext? None. Foreshadowing? Hey do you like movies or dont you? This is a film wherein a scientist rejoices that he has figured out how to predict earthquakes no more than 60 seconds before an earthquake makes him pay the ultimate price for his hubris. Predict that Poindexter it almost says. Then it crumples the Hoover Dam the first of many landmarks to be digitally struck from the landscape. Its too bad that first act of playfulness vanishes once the buildings start coming down. The makers of San Andreas have heard your complaints about the callous city-destroying in Man of Steel and Star Trek into Darkness two summers ago and responded by leveling two cities LA and then for the finale San Francisco. More astute specimens of the disaster-survival genre -- the Steven Spielberg War of the Worlds from a decade ago; last years Gareth Edwards-directed Godzilla -- evince some moral awareness of the massive death toll they imply while still being massively entertaining. San Andreas is closer to the cheerful style of Roland Emmerich the German filmmaker who came to Hollywood and then razed it three times in Independence Day The Day After Tomorrow and 2012. What San Andreas has in common with Emmerichs megadeath megahits is its conviction that though mostly-unseen millions perish if the half-dozen people were following pull through it counts as a happy ending. Costing a thrifty-for-its scale 100 million and clocking in at under two hours San Andreas hasnt time or money for the subplots and oddball supporting players that make even (other) middling disaster flicks so hard to turn off. Theres no cocky-but-supersmart Jeff Goldblum type. No wingnut survivalist Tim Robbins. No President Morgan Freeman. Bland and efficient it comes to us from Canadian Brad Peyton who previously teamed with Johnson on Journey 2 The Mysterious Island and also made Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore which sounds like even its title was neutered. (The voice of Kitty Galore was one Bette Midler a performer not known for prudishness.) So through austerity budgeting or by design San Andreas is a star vehicle. Johnson dialing down his Furious 7 arm-cast popping swagger is a calming presence his manner as implacable and mountainous as his cod-fed physique. Whether or not it counts as a great performance he has that Zen fearlessness Keanu Reeves had in Speed. One day hell have it in a better movie. Introduced via a thrilling cliffside chopper rescue he brings the opening line ""Just doing my job Maam."" Only he cant make that claim for long because the first time he glances down from the cockpit and casually notices a freeway overpass dissolving into dust he and his whirlybird go AWOL to save Gugino and then Daddario whos up in San Francisco with Moms rich land-developer boyfriend. (The movie encourages us to bay for his blood then only kinda-sorta delivers.) This rank dereliction of duty by a fire and rescue chief during LAs darkest hour might make for gripping drama if the movie took even the slightest notice that its hero -- a decorated Army veteran were told -- is committing a huge crime the kind that gets you court martialed and jailed and/or dishonorably discharged from the service. Look you cant count on the government in a crisis especially if we assume that every government employee who can swing it is going to steal a helicopter and go take care of his own. Why these parents believe their daughter needs rescuing during this statewide emergency is unclear Shes a resourceful kid who we see has learned plenty of valuable survival skills from her soldier-turned-rescue-worker pop. The two cute British boys she hooks up with once the quake hits San Andreas alternate-California Asian-American-free San Francisco -- Hugo Johnston-Burt and Art Parkinson as respectively an age-appropriate beau and his kid brother who looks and sounds like he just walked in from a production of Oliver -- take their marching orders from her. Still Daddario finds herself in watery peril just as her folks arrive from out of town so that Johnson can pump water from her lungs while yelling ""Dont you quit on me Girl"" Later he and his soon-to-be-ex-ex-wife gaze out at the tableau of devastation while someone unfurls Old Glory from the remains of a bridge. ""Now we rebuild"" says The Rock. Daddario and her new boyfriend are there too the four of them looking ready to put their superior genetic material to work repopulating a California from which all the quitters have been washed away. You better believe theyll make sure no busted-face Giamattis slip through this time.

But a determined Dwayne The Rock Johnson is focused on saving the day for his onscreen family proving once again that blood relations are critical in the midst of a movie disaster. There is no value in just saving strangers in a story like this one. It is also Johnson one of the genuine nice guys in the shark-infested world of Hollywood who gives us the reason to watch Brad Peytons earthquake thriller. Impossibly muscle-bound but never even remotely as stupid as the plots of most of his movies Johnson is a bonafide action hero who makes us feel safe in the middle of chaos and crisis. In this case in San Andreas the crisis is a double whammy of two gigantic earthquakes. They shake up California along the San Andreas Fault. Los Angeles where Johnsons estranged movie wife (Carla Gugino) is hanging out is destroyed in the first wave. Cue the rescue attempt by helicopter because Johnson plays a first responder copter pilot. San Francisco where Johnson and Guginos daughter (Alexandra Daddario) happens to be with her moms new loser boyfriend (Ioan Gruffudd) is going to get it in the second wave. A tsunami will add to the carnage generated by the earthquakes and their aftershocks. You need a movie hero like Johnson to handle the situation. The absurdity of San Andreas -- the movie and not the fault line -- is that Johnson his family members and two intrepid British friends that Daddario encounters in Frisco repeatedly escape death by split seconds by millimetres by a single last breath underwater by sheer happenstance and by Johnsons derring-do. He gets to defy logic laws of gravity and physics and any level of believability to outwit outrun outfly and out-whatever everything that comes his way. The weird thing about it is that we can enjoy it so much even while masses of ordinary folks -- and the occasional cowardly villain -- are wiped out in the aftermath of the multiple disasters that earthquakes can cause. Now is the time for a moment of reflection. The special effects that Canadian-born director Peyton employs are powerful expensive and relentless. They also suggest what it might have been like at least in part for the people of Nepal who have actually had to endure an earthquake double-whammy over the past five weeks. They say that art imitates life but San Andreas is not exactly art and life and death is far more brutal and damaging than images in a movie. Even when they are projected in 3D (although this is your choice San Andreas is also available in a 2D version). But we all know that San Andreas is just an entertainment even with the obvious body count from the ravages of the earthquakes the collapsing buildings the fires and the floods. Missing is a rain of frogs. The plot of San Andreas was concocted by Andre Fabrizio and Jeremy Passmore and then written up as a screenplay by Carlton Cuse (best known for Lost). Peyton a native of Gander N.L. pulled the pieces together for a typical action picture. He obviously has a rapport with Johnson and the other leads while working equally well with support players such as Paul Giamatti (as the seismologist) Archie Panjabi Hugo Johnstone-Burt and spunky child actor Art Parkinson. San Andreas does exactly what it set out to do Satisfy the thrill-seekers with a popcorn movie. If you want something more serious about earthquakes you have to watch the nightly news.

But a determined Dwayne The Rock Johnson is focused on saving the day for his onscreen family proving once again that blood relations are critical in the midst of a movie disaster. There is no value in just saving strangers in a story like this one. It is also Johnson one of the genuine nice guys in the shark-infested world of Hollywood who gives us the reason to watch Brad Peytons earthquake thriller. Impossibly muscle-bound but never even remotely as stupid as the plots of most of his movies Johnson is a bonafide action hero who makes us feel safe in the middle of chaos and crisis. In this case in San Andreas the crisis is a double whammy of two gigantic earthquakes. They shake up California along the San Andreas Fault.

"San Andreas is Taken but shaken review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesSan Andreas is Taken but shaken reviewWho cares about earthquakes levelling L.A. and San Francisco when family unity is at stake? San Andreas thunderously demonstrates the late Roger Eberts maxim about movies being an empathy-generating machine.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. May 28 2015San AndreasStarring Dwayne Johnson Carla Gugino Alexandra Daddario Paul Giamatti Hugo Johnstone-Burt Art Parkinson and Ioan Gruffudd. Directed by Brad Peyton. At GTA theatres. 114 minutes. PGDisaster film San Andreas thunderously demonstrates the late Roger Eberts maxim about movies being an empathy-generating machine.The science may be dodgy in this blockbuster multiplex shaker in which a series of massive earthquakes hit California reducing Los Angeles and San Francisco to heaps of teetering skyscrapers and collapsing bridges.Article Continued BelowBut the empathy is solid in the hero story of Ray (Dwayne Johnson) a helicopter pilot for the L.A. Fire Department. His determination to rescue his family establishes an undeniable audience connection along with a few chuckles over the cheesy plot and dialogue.Dwayne Johnson left is Ray and Alexandra Daddario is daughter Blake in San Andreas.  (Jasin Boland / THE ASSOCIATED PRESS)  Rays dogged quest to save his quake-trapped daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario) shares a paternal franticness with Liam Neesoms Parisian rescue rampage in the kidnap drama Taken. This includes the subplot about divorce tearing the family asunder and a smarmy new guy (Ioan Gruffudd) supplanting the stubborn old one in the marital bed.In this case however Rays estranged wife Emma (Carla Gugino) joins in the heroics which is a welcome change from genre norms.Hollywood has long had an almost perverse desire to make films about California catastrophes at least as far back as San Francisco in 1936 a musical-drama starring Clark Gable and Jeanette MacDonald that was based on the 1906 earthquake in the Golden Gate City.Technological advances have made each successive quake movie more realistic. San Andreas employs seamless CGI and 3D effects for an alarmingly convincing depiction of the all-too-plausible scenario of seismic disaster in California caused by shifting tectonic plates of the San Andreas Fault that crosses the state.This is a rare example of a disaster film that actually downplays the devastation. The real death toll caused by earthquakes of this magnitude -- exceeding 9 on the Richter scale -- would result in a body count many times higher than could be shown in a movie intended for popcorn audiences.Street scenes in San Andreas are thus often surprisingly empty and more damage is seen being done to structures than people.Thats all the better to help us focus on Ray who seems to be the only first responder left after earthquakes that began in Nevada (rupturing the Hoover Dam in one spectacular early sequence) rumble their way into California.A prologue demonstrates Rays helicopter flying skills and cowboy daring in the mountainside rescue of a woman trapped in a car establishing him as the unflappable go-to guy in any kind of crisis.When you think about it is there anybody else youd want looking out for you in times of trouble than Johnson? His former wrestling nickname ""The Rock"" barely describes what a mountain of beefcake this guy is and Johnson agreeably flexes his muscles on cue.His valiant Ray is always on the go and ready for action whether its happening on land in the air or on (and under) the water. Hes a great improviser hot-wiring cars ""borrowing"" aircraft and breaking all the rules as he first races to Emmas aid in L.A. and then to Blakes in San Francisco.Neither of the two women however are standard damsels in distress. Blake demonstrates resourcefulness of her own as she meets-cute and then teams with British engineer Ben (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) and his precocious kid brother Ollie (Art Parkinson) in a bid to reach higher ground.And Emma demonstrates pluck to spare after shes forced to fight her way out of a towering inferno in downtown L.A.A side story in which Paul Giamatti plays a prophetic seismology professor at Caltech attempts to establish the scientific bona fides of San Andreas with predictable grousing about lack of public preparedness for earthquakes.""No one listens to us until the ground shakes"" sighs Giamattis Lawrence who functions as narrative expositor and finger-wagger. He and his lab partners have developed a computer program to predict when quakes are about to hit based on his decades of study. Yet he seems surprised to learn how the tectonic plates of the San Andreas Fault are connected. Lawrence speaks to the threatened masses through the ready camera of TV journalist (Archie Panjabi as Serena) warning them about the danger of underestimating the wrath of Mother Nature but its always with fatherly concern and a divine blessing.San Andreas is efficiently directed by Canadian-born Brad Peyton (Journey 2 The Mysterious Island) from a screenplay credited in the main to Carlton Cruse a TV writer for Lost Bates Motel Nash Bridges and other series.Cruses background in episodic TV is evident in the start-stop nature of San Andreas in which a quake-related mishap is followed by a dramatic save and the inevitable first question ""Are you OK?""The movie wants us to ask the same about Ray and his family. The Golden Gate Bridge may tumble and L.A. towers may topple but who really cares about all that? What we really want to know as San Andreas generates empathy with seismic impact is whether Ray Emma and Blake are gonna be OK again as a family.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Skyscrapers crumble. Fires erupt. The letters of the Hollywood Sign topple. Dwayne Johnson stars as a helicopter-rescue pilot trying to save his family after a massive earthquake that is more ridiculous than impressive though the scale is enormous.Hollywoods favorite geologic bad guy is back in ""San Andreas"" starring Dwayne Johnson (left) and Carla Gugino. Its a fantastical look at one of the worlds real seismic threats.(Photo Warner Bros. Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics rating 1.5 stars (out of 5)Johnsons character is quickly established as a hero.The effects are overwhelming forcing you to submit to the absurdity of the story.Hahahaha.Really thats about all there is to say about ""San Andreas"" the brain-rattling disaster of a disaster film directed by Brad Peyton and starring Dwayne Johnson. (Dont worry systematic pummeling is all your brain will be used for during the film anyway.)To appreciate the effect of watching this movie here is a suggestion Go to your music collection and find the loudest angriest heavy metal music youve got (something where they use jackhammers for percussion) put on headphones and crank it up UNTIL EVERYTHING SOUNDS LIKE THIS. Its crucial that it be so loud that you cannot think straight. Otherwise you might pay attention.In many ways ""San Andreas"" is the summer blockbuster taken to its logical extreme. Its bigger louder and more effects-heavy than anything else out there. It wants to make you feel not in the emotional sense but in the tactile one.More Movie reviews and featuresMission accomplished. You definitely feel this film the way you feel a hammer hitting you in the head.The story begins with a death-defying rescue by helicopter in LA that quickly establishes Afghanistan veteran Ray (Johnson) as our hero. Hell hes practically Superman but we dont know that yet. Peyton shoots him with the sun behind him though so the halo effect is a hint that hes not your average dude.Ray is planning to drive his daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario) to college in San Francisco the next day. But in the meantime a massive earthquake strikes and destroys the Hoover Dam confirming the worst fears of seismologist Lawrence (Paul Giamatti). This is the side plot meant to give the movie a sheen of ... I dont know something other than buildings falling down.Ray and his team are going to fly up to the dam to help with rescue efforts so Blake flies to school with Daniel (Ioan Gruffudd) the ultra-rich oily developer her mother Emma (Carla Gugino) has been seeing on his private jet.Lawrence warns that the quakes are nowhere near over and boy does he know how to undersell the point. Massive quakes strike all along the San Andreas fault from Los Angeles where Emma is all the way to San Francisco where Blake has arrived. (Dont worry if you dont know much about the fault; this is the kind of movie where brilliant professors like Lawrence explain grade-school basics to their brilliant students at Cal Tech.)So thats it really. The rest of the film is divided between computer-enhanced earthquake disasters (with a tsunami thrown in for good measure) and the occasional timeout so that Ray and Emma can see the error of splitting up. They travel to San Francisco to find Blake and while its a pretty big city never sell short the power of absurd coincidence when it comes to Dwayne Johnson being a hero.Ray has taught Blake well -- she helps new friend Ben (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) and his little brother Ollie (Art Parkinson) navigate the chaos.AZCENTRALSan Andreas (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsOf which there is a gracious plenty. There are also presumably many millions of deaths but we only see one in any kind of detail and its a plot point.""San Andreas"" is a throwback of sorts to 70s disaster films like ""Airport"" (though in retrospect that film looks more and more like ""The Love Boat"" set on an airplane). This film is conservative in its approach in that man is not to blame unlike some of the environmentally charged disaster films like ""Frogs"" that enjoyed a brief vogue also in the 1970s. This is an act of God though a pretty angry God by the looks of things.But who are we kidding? The purpose of ""San Andreas"" is not to make us think but to make us gape to pummel us with effect and effect until we finally give in.Fair enough. Uncle.

"San Andreas rocks technically if not dramatically - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review San Andreas rocks technically if not dramatically San Andreas Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews San Andreas Starring Dwayne Johnson Carla Gugino and Alexandra Daddario. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews San Andreas Starring Dwayne Johnson Carla Gugino and Alexandra Daddario. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter San Andreas starring Dwayne Johnson wields compelling effects but by-the-numbers drama a review While residents of other locales can experience the new earthquake drama ""San Andreas"" with equanimity we who live in the Golden State are not so fortunate. Oh no.As temblors of unprecedented size and scope not to mention one towering tsunami turn California into a smoldering ruin causing the Hollywood sign to unceremoniously collapse and the Oakland Bay Bridge to undulate like a strand of spaghetti we have to ask ourselves do I really need to see this? Is the entertainment on offer going to be worth the sweaty palms sure to come? The answer is ... maybe. On one hand even though scientists are already lining up to debunk some of its suppositions ""San Andreas"" has the technical might to make the post-quake horrors it depicts all too plausible. VFX producer Randall Starr has used more than 1300 visual effects shots to such compelling effect that moving to Bemidji Minn. seems like a plausible option.On the other hand as directed by Brad Peyton and written by Carlton Cuse (from a story by Andre Fabrizio and Jeremy Passmore) ""San Andreas"" is woefully by-the-numbers from a dramatic point of view. Even by the non-Olympian standards of the disaster genre ""San Andreas"" is chock-full of cliche characters staggering coincidences and wild improbabilities. And its dialogue is so of the ""this is gonna hurt"" variety that I tallied close to half a dozen ""Oh my Gods"" before I stopped counting. San Andreas aims to shake up audiences with an up-close catastrophe Gina Piccalo When director Brad Peyton pitched Dwayne Johnson on ""San Andreas"" a relentless thrill ride that brings the Big One to the big screen for the first time in 40 years he promised to redefine the disaster genre. ""I want to create shots that truly immerse the audience inside the earthquake inside... When director Brad Peyton pitched Dwayne Johnson on ""San Andreas"" a relentless thrill ride that brings the Big One to the big screen for the first time in 40 years he promised to redefine the disaster genre. ""I want to create shots that truly immerse the audience inside the earthquake inside... (Gina Piccalo) Yet films this preposterous can be engaging if you know what youre getting in for especially if they have the advantage of Dwayne Johnson once known as the Rock in the starring role.An action hero with a rare kind of gravitas Johnson has a stabilizing influence on all the silliness that surrounds him. At 43 and a movie star for more than a dozen years he has a face that is showing signs of emotional erosion enabling him to convey a conviction that cant be easy given the implausible nature of the proceedings. Fight or flight? These stars are ready for any apocalypse. Johnson plays Ray Gaines who pilots a rescue helicopter for the Los Angeles Fire Department search and rescue unit. An all-business type who never gets flustered -- think ""Dragnets"" Jack Webb with arms like fire hydrants -- Ray has a chance to show us how he operates when a car driven by blond Natalie (Morgan Griffin) goes over a cliff somewhere in the Valley and he has to make it all right. Cut to the hallowed halls of Caltech where rumpled seismologist (is there any other kind?) Lawrence Hayes (Paul Giamatti) is showing his class unnerving footage of the 9.3-magnitude 1964 Anchorage earthquake. ""Could something that intense happen here?"" a student conveniently asks. You better believe it.Hayes is working on a theory about the possible predictability of quakes a hypothesis that takes him and a colleague to Nevada where in a hint of things to come a potent quake causes all kinds of mayhem even dramatically pulverizing the massive Hoover Dam.Back in L.A. Ray Gaines is trying to sort out his personal life. Rays estranged wife Emma (Carla Gugino) turns out to be keeping company with massively wealthy developer Daniel (Ioan Gruffudd). And Rays plans to take his daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario) up north to college fizzle and she ends up hitching a private plane ride with her moms new boyfriend.Then as Hayes has shrewdly predicted the entire San Andreas fault gets activated triggering a rolling series of quakes in Los Angeles and finally San Francisco causing more chaos than you can shake a stick at.Youd think that with all that damage caused by a 9.1 quake with freeways buckling and huge buildings crumbling into dust before our eyes chopper pilot Ray would be rescuing as many people as possible but you would be wrong. It turns out to be ""San Andreas "" peculiar plot dynamic that Ray spends the entire movie dealing exclusively with his immediate family.First there is Emma who is having lunch at a tony rooftop restaurant in downtown L.A. and has the good fortune to be on the phone to Ray when the quake hits.Up in San Francisco Blake is also in trouble though she also has a polite young Brit named Ben (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) and his younger brother Ollie (Art Parkinson) to keep her company. She too places a call to Ray who turns to Emma and says yes ""Were going to get our daughter."" Its that kind of a movie.Not that any of that turns out to be easy not with a second even bigger quake headed for the Bay Area and a tsunami that makes the parted Red Sea in ""Exodus Gods and Kings"" look like a kids wading pool. ""Pray for the people of San Francisco"" someone piously intones at one point. And while youre at it spare some good wishes for the viewers of ""San Andreas."" Theyre going to need them.kenneth.turanlatimes.com Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Earthquakes Dwayne Johnson Jack Webb Paul Giamatti Golden State Warriors Seeing the movie San Andreas?

The dumb stuff is the story strung out in a by-the-numbers script that gives special prominence to numbers on the Richter scale. But two additional elements intrude. One of them is obvious. The recent earthquakes in Nepal with their horrific aftermath remind us of the chasm between fiction and fact. The other is personal. Things always change when youve got skin in the game.

A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The San Andreas Fault stretches 810 miles up the Pacific coast roughly the length of a dozen Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnsons lying end to end. When it rumbles well need all 12 of him to spring into action -- although as Brad Peytons San Andreas warns that still wont be enough to save the day.Disaster films offer the thrill of an impossible enemy. Theres no hope of a hero who can stop the shaking soothe the tsunamis and snuff the fires not even the 260-pound Johnson who here rips off a car door with his bare hands. No these events could happen and these flicks let us grapple with chaos for 90 minutes and emerged unscathed like submissives gleefully cowering under a black leather boot.Film Details San Andreas RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time107 min. More Info Trailer Johnson plays first responder Ray a divorcing father of two who lost one of his daughters to a rafting accident and his wife Emma (Carla Gugino) to his inability to open up about that pain. His surviving child Blake (Alexandra Daddario) is leaving Los Angeles for college and Ray is unmanned to hand her over to British architect Daniel (Ioan Gruffudd) her stepdad-to-be whose private plane will fly her to school in Seattle with just a brief stop to visit Blakes new skyscraper in San Francisco. What could go wrong?Related StoriesA Massive Earthquake Would Subject L.A. to Furious FiresEverything of course. You would know even if you ignored the title and trailer as the film is thick with doom. In the opening shot Peyton pans over Los Angeles as if he cant wait for the apocalypse -- even the font identifying it as the San Fernando Valley is a war-blasted gun-metal gray. Minutes later a Caltech geology professor (Paul Giamatti) assures himself a failing score on RateMyProfessor when he scares his classroom with the news that the likelihood of a 9.4-plus earthquake hitting the city isnt ""a matter of if but when."" For a kicker he adds that its a century overdue.San Andreas cant wait for the carnage. The problem is its too chicken to ask us to comprehend it. Its all big distant unfathomable wreckage -- all shattering skyscrapers and rippling cityscapes -- with no sense of the human cost. Even Gareth Edwards Godzilla knew to zoom in on a desperate dog once in a while. And Roland Emmerichs unfairly maligned 2012 understood that its story was a tragedy. Emmerich gave us truly awesome images -- a battleship smashing into the White House -- and added gravitas and grief. He was willing to let characters die so that we knew that all his staggering visuals came at a price. But San Andreas wants the applause without the tears offering no emotional impact just cool shots of streets splintering apart.Our CG blockbusters have sanitized death as something sad and vague that happens to people without faces. In San Andreas victims dont die they simply trudge by like doomed zombies and disappear into the margins as the camera charges after Johnson and Gugino racing toward San Francisco to save their daughter. The film never doubts that Ray and Emma (or really just Ray) can find Blake in a city without cell service and swoop her up out of the flood. But Johnson is the wrong type of hero for a film like this. In the face of consuming disaster we dont need a superhuman jock. We need an average man or woman someone who looks like us just doing what he or she can.Peyton keeps the film so focused on Rays family that San Andreas begins to feel callous. Unlike Steven Spielbergs War of the Worlds a movie with the courage to ask if selfishness in a disaster could ever be morally excused Peytons film isnt trying to make us think. Instead it takes for granted that Rays concerns are our concerns. But when 8 million people could be dead who cares about this guys divorce?Though hes a rescue expert Ray rarely bothers to help strangers. In one scene he deliberately ignores two stranded grandparents on the side of a freeway until he realizes that the road ahead is blocked. Forced to turn around he apologizes. In return they offer him a plane. In another scene Ray and Emma blast through the streets of San Francisco on a speedboat screaming out for Blake past another boat whose passengers are trying to pull people aboard. Were meant to cheer but what about the civilians chopped up underneath them? Who are the real heroes? Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

This is after all a film where one of our most charismatic actors tandem-parachutes onto a baseball diamond with his estranged wife and jokes ""Its been a while since weve been to second base."" But it filled me with a deep chill that has nothing to do with glimpsing my actual neighborhood reduced to rubble. (After all it was just a bloodless aerial shot of crumbled buildings.)Still I recommend San Andreas as required viewing for every East Coaster considering a move West. No really the Big One could happen anytime.

Entertainment) Considered as pure spectacle ""San Andreas"" is gripping and effective as well as a somewhat interesting form of counter-narrative A vision of near-term apocalypse that has nothing to do with climate change monsters or alien invaders. This movie begins with a thrilling rescue sequence featuring debonair Dwayne Johnson at the controls of a Los Angeles Fire Department chopper saving an attractive young woman who is trapped in her car in a precipitous canyon off Mulholland Drive. The sequence of huge earthquakes that will reduce Californias two greatest cities to rubble and slurry hasnt even started and weve pretty much seen the movie. Danger and disaster are still a test of masculinity but the model of masculinity has shifted a little A new kind of manhood is in vogue or maybe its the old kind with a few moral and epistemological nips and tucks.So as you can already see ""San Andreas"" isnt just pure spectacle even if it contains some of the best scenes of CGI destruction in the recent Hollywood tradition delivered with much more weight and realism than in Michael Bays mind-numbing ""Transformers"" movies for example. Like nearly all Hollywood movies it carries an ideological message - and like all Hollywood movies in an age where most of Hollywoods money is made overseas that message is bafflingly vague. Theres a bit of flag-waving towards the end of ""San Andreas"" and a passing reference to the idea that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan might not have been entirely pointless - because crucible of manhood something something - but mostly the message is that dad-type guys are still cool in this era of modified gender relations and the nuclear family can still be redeemed.Ive got no problem with the biologically generated nuclear family honestly. Im the partial proprietor of one of them myself. But the disaster-movie template so rigorously observed by ""San Andreas"" - the first A-grade Hollywood flick for Canadian director Brad Peyton from a script by TV veteran Carlton Cuse - reeks of desperation or maybe just deeply ingrained ludicrousness and laziness. Thousands or perhaps millions die as Los Angeles and San Francisco are virtually leveled by a string of 9-plus Richter events along the San Andreas Fault. But Ray the Iraq vet turned LAFD rescue stud played by Johnson essentially throws away all his emergency-responder life-saving responsibilities to search for his estranged wife Emma (Carla Gugino) and their adult daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario).Is this the new model of manhood that the movie star formerly known as the Rock has been cooking all this time? Because its something like Maggie Thatcher on steroids Theres no such thing as society you jabronis Know your role Ray can fly fly a helicopter like a boss and a crop-duster plane too. He steals an already stolen pickup from some skinhead and ""borrows"" some rich dudes badass powerboat. He knows how to skydive how to outwit an incoming tsunami and where to stay safe in a collapsing stadium. (The San Francisco Giants overly precious waterfront baseball park is only one of the citys numerous landmarks to be shredded squished blended sliced and diced.) But everybody else in California can go jump in the states suddenly exposed central butt crack basically because Rays comin for his daughter.Among this movies casting oddities we have the fact that Johnson and Gugino are both 43 years old in real life making them an unusually age-appropriate couple for the movies - while Daddario who plays their daughter is 29. Interesting story there guys While I dont want to go deep on this question I will also mention the delicate topic that Blake is um pretty much white and does not look not as if she has a father who is part African-American and part Pacific Islander. Then again other peoples families even when fictional are arguably none of my business. So well leave that there. You Might Also Like Johnson is one of the most inherently likable figures in contemporary celebrity-land and the story of his improbable rise from NFL washout and pro-wrestling ""heel"" to avatar of manhood is an interesting one. Hes like a G.I. Joe doll implanted with a high grade of self-regarding artificial intelligence. From his early days on Vince McMahons wrestling circuit as the Rock Johnson always appeared to be in on the joke and to possess a strange combination of mockery and niceness that made him stand out. ""Finally - finally - the Rock has returned to Oshkosh"" he would announce with a beatific glow affecting not to notice the lusty boos raining down from the citizens of Oshkosh. All by himself Johnson almost rescued the incomprehensible mess of Richard Kellys unfinished magnum opus ""Southland Tales"" with pure good cheer playing the dim but endlessly supportive boyfriend to porn star and sports-drink entrepreneur Sarah Michelle Gellar.So the thing is as hoary and retrograde and pure-dee downright stupid as the story of ""San Andreas"" may be you cant help rooting for Ray to get back together with Emma and Blake and start life anew in a state with far fewer residents and its most important cities reduced to rubble. The drought problem and the Republican electoral dilemma both solved in one go (Im here all week but dont eat the three-bean salad) At the same time I cant help thinking that Johnson is just a little too smart and interesting for this kind of deeply forgettable formula fare which will make a ton of money this month and never be seen again by anyone. Paul Giamatti character schlub par excellence earns a decent paycheck as the seismologist who sees this all coming and Im sorry we dont see more of Kylie Minogue in a teensy bitchy cameo that threatens to eat the whole movie. Were not even quite to June - and this is the next-to-last of the really big summer flicks with only ""Jurassic World"" left to go (Whats that you say? ""Ant-Man""? Did you really just admit that youre gonna be scrunching up the beach towel with your toes and wishing it wasnt so long until ""Ant-Man""?) Theres a lot more to say about the way that Hollywood is pushing forward into new technical terrain - the effects here are awe-inspiring at times - while sliding backwards in narrative terms and at best sideways when it comes to depicting social reality. I dont begrudge anyone their desire to melt their brain with this bullshit extravaganza and dont begrudge Dwayne Johnson his exorbitant salary. But dont try to tell me that the naked wish fulfillment of ""San Andreas"" isnt profoundly messed up We know our country is doomed and I mean we know it on a bone level. But somehow or other we also think our kids will grow up and be cool and its all totally fine. The coming disaster is for other people. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Photo Jasin Boland Image 13 of 13 Disaster-flick fans get a fair shake in San Andreas 1 / 13 Back to Gallery Needless to say its a very big earthquake. It starts at the Hoover Dam snakes its way west to Los Angeles and then cuts north through Bakersfield on the way to the big enchilada San Francisco. With ""San Andreas"" audiences get a glimpse of the Big One only here theres not a single Big One but Big Ones. Taking into account aftershocks and the fact that various localities feel each others quakes the filmmakers figure out a way to keep things shaking for most of the movies 114 minutes. Credit must be given for truth in advertising. The movie promises earthquake effects and delivers them. Ten years from now these effects may be old stuff but in 2015 you will not find better. And while after about an hour the sight of buildings exploding and imploding starts to get numbing the movie stays alive by focusing on the micro-disasters as well such as what its like for a person to be inside a building as its pancaking or to be trapped inside a car in a basement garage right before a cave-in. The earthquakes are the stars of ""San Andreas"" and no one pretends otherwise but there are actual people in the movie because debris has to fall on somebody. Paul Giamatti walking a line between drama (on the surface) and comedy (what hes really thinking) plays a seismologist whose mission is to predict catastrophic earthquakes. At the start hes smart enough to forecast the Hoover Dam quake about eight seconds before it happens. Later he improves his method to the point that he can issue televised warnings ""I cannot emphasize this enough to the people of San Francisco. You need to get out -- now"" Related Stories Movies that destroy San Francisco Of course the safest route out is to the north over the Golden Gate Bridge ... uh-oh. Giamatti is the man of intellect. Dwayne Johnson plays the man of action a rescue pilot who at the start of the movie has the same family difficulty that Liam Neeson had at the start of ""Taken."" His workaholism has wrecked his marriage and now his wife (Carla Gugino) and loving daughter (Alexandra Daddario) are living in the Los Angeles mansion of a rich guy. Money usually means security. But when youre on the roof of a building thats collapsing its better to know somebody who flies a helicopter. Though no one will ever confuse him with Olivier Johnson is ideal in this kind of movie -- huge enough to compete with the special effects and with an aura of doggedness and competence that makes you believe hed never give up. For most of the action Johnson and Gugino playing ex-spouses travel across California to find their teenage daughter and their relationship is convincing and nicely built. Johnson is the kind of actor who needs a mission. Tell him his characters purpose is to save his family and thats what he plays -- every second hes onscreen. Theres not much nuance there but its a form of good acting. If anything the young people are even better -- Daddario as the capable daughter a chip off the old Rock; and Hugo Johnstone-Burt as the lucky young Englishman who will soon be her boyfriend if they can both survive the next 24 hours. Hoover Dam is the hors doeuvre; Los Angeles is the appetizer and San Francisco is the main course. The places in between are light snacks occasioning the odd remark. (She ""Where are we?"" He ""Bakersfield. Or whats left of it."") Say goodbye to the Hollywood sign. The Transamerica Pyramid is now the Transamerica Stump. The Bay Bridge finally gets its close-up and ATamp;T Park will soon have to adopt new rules. For example if the baseball drops through a crevice and falls to the center of the Earth thats a ground-rule double. By turns frightening exciting and ridiculous ""San Andreas"" is in the end more impressive than anything else. We take for granted that a movie can show a tsunami but when filmmakers come up with ways to make that tsunami particularly vivid and horrifying thats something else. (And isnt it nice that San Franciscans can have the Venice experience without flying to Italy?) Likewise a helicopter roof rescue is all well and good but how about one from a low building while taller buildings are collapsing all around it? Some movies are easy to mock but hard to resist. This is one of them. And as much as a barbecue by the pool with the ballgame playing on the radio ""San Andreas"" has the feeling of summer. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

""San Andreas"" ""San Andreas"" Despite its faults San Andreas is a thrill ride By Kevin C. Johnson / kjohnsonpost-dispatch.com Kevin C. Johnson May 28 2015 (...) Carla Gugino (left) and Dwayne Johnson in ""San Andreas."" ""San Andreas"" ""San Andreas"" ""San Andreas"" is going to do one of two things once the rubble clears It will either put an end to the disaster movie genre for a long while so catastrophic that nothing can follow it or it will open the floodgates to more onscreen calamity.What happens will most likely depend on how willing moviegoers are to seeing California nearly wiped off the globe after the long-promised Big One finally shows itself.In this roller-coaster ride of a disaster flick Ray (Dwayne Johnson) is a rescue-chopper pilot with a soon-to-be ex-wife Emma (Carla Gugino); a perky daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario); and a past family tragedy that feels completely unnecessary. Emmas moving on and in with boyfriend Daniel (Ioan Gruffudd) a building developer whose latest project is the tallest skyscraper in San Francisco. (Daniels character is reminiscent of one in ""The Towering Inferno"" nearly to the point of homage.)Meanwhile seismology professor Lawrence (Paul Giamatti) detects tremor activity in Nevada moments before the graphic destruction of the Hoover Dam. He predicts that its the beginning of something much worse and within moments the San Andreas fault lets loose. His prescience hardly seems helpful.Emma is lunching on the top floor of an LA skyscraper while Blake is in San Francisco flirting with young Brit Ben (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) when disaster strikes.Buildings collapse tsunamis cover cities bridges fall into the ocean ocean liners barrel into downtown streets and countless people perish. ""San Andreas"" is clearly concerned with the fate of only Ray and his beautiful family. Ray uses the company chopper to get to his own while the rest of the folks in danger be damned.The family members unusually spry for laypeople seem to get out of every predicament in the nick of time. If you want a more realistic family struggle during disaster check into the far superior Naomi Watts movie ""The Impossible.""The special effects and especially the 3-D are top-notch. Its rare these days to find a movie in which the 3-D version is actually more than an excuse to bump up the ticket prices. Directed by Brad Peyton ""San Andreas"" is an action film that hits viewers over the head.

EntertainmentMovies San Andreas Never fear The Rocks here Originally published May 28 2015 at 1203 pm Updated May 28 2015 at 104 pm A movie review of ""San Andreas"" This disaster movie starring Dwayne Johnson is no masterpiece but it nicely delivers the computer-generated goods. Rating 2.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic The underlying message of ""San Andreas"" is a simple one When disaster strikes you really want to be standing somewhere near The Rock. As rescue pilot Ray the actor now known as Dwayne Johnson employs not just his massive forearms but an impressive array of purloined transportation encompassing planes cars boats and parachutes all in the service of saving his teenage daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario) from a devastating earthquake. Along the way he reunites with his ex-wife Emma (Carla Gugino) saves a random girl from a car dangling vertically from the side of a cliff and constantly announces soothingly and against all available evidence ""Its gonna be OK."" And you believe him because somewhere along the way over a decade or so of moviemaking this former wrestler became not quite a nuanced actor but a relaxed and appealing good-guy screen presence. Hes just the right hero to anchor Brad Peytons disaster-to-end-all-disasters movie in which pretty much all of San Francisco and much of California is destroyed in a massive series of earthquakes described as I think ""seismic swarm activity"" by the movies resident scientist Lawrence (Paul Giamatti collecting what I hope was a very nice paycheck). Ray must rally to first rescue Emma (whos in L.A. on a crumbling rooftop) then Blake (whos in San Francisco in all manner of perilous situations) against all odds ""San Andreas"" is no masterpiece even by disaster-movie standards; its overwhelming overlong and not even the teeniest bit subtle -- this is the sort of special Hollywood earthquake that mostly kills just the nasty people. It features such cliches as the Heroine Pausing Mid-Disaster to Change Outfits (Ray and Emma make an emergency landing conveniently at a gutted-out clothing store) and the Implausible Last-Minute Revival of a Supposedly Dead Person. And the 3D effects as usual add more to the ticket price than to the film. But the movie nicely delivers the computer-generated goods -- the destruction of the Golden Gate Bridge is pretty spectacular -- and if Johnson doesnt quite make it sing at least it growls suspensefully. Movie Review 1/2   San Andreas with Dwayne Johnson Carla Gugino Alexandra Daddario Ioan Gruffudd Archie Panjabi Paul Giamatti Hugo Johnstone-Burt Art Parkinson. Directed by Brad Peyton from a screenplay by Carlton Cuse. 107 minutes. Rated PG-13 for intense disaster action and mayhem throughout and brief strong language. Several theaters. One last thought which I pondered during the slower parts of the movie With the recent devastating earthquakes in Nepal not to mention natural disasters within our own borders the timing of ""San Andreas"" as summer-movie entertainment feels a bit discomfiting. But what if everyone who attended and could easily afford to do so also made a donation to a disaster relief organization? Even small donations -- equivalent to say a movie-ticket purchase -- would add up. I just did so at redcross.org; took about 90 seconds. Moviegoing as a force for good? That sounds like something The Rock could get behind. Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 125pm on Thursday May. 28 2015 Thursday May. 28 2015 Thursday May. 28 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Well the filmmakers behind San Andreas deserve credit for at least one thing They didnt skimp on the effects.Not only do they have Los Angeles San Francisco and Hoover Dam getting razed to rubble in a series of giant continent-shaking earthquakes they even plant a sweet CGI cherry on top of all this seismic sundae in the form of a tsunami. The appeal of disaster movies like this is seeing civilization reduced to dust and on that score San Andreas delivers. When the earth is roiling and rippling like an angry ocean its an impressive sight. Its when the shaking stops though that San Andreas is a different type of disaster.Director Brad Peyton ( Journey 2 The Mysterious Island) working from a rote script by Carlton Cuse ( Bates Motel Lost) seems to realize this. He starts off in high gear with a white-knuckle mountain rescue as a way to introduce heroic chopper pilot Ray (Dwayne Johnson) and then quickly gets the ground shaking not long after.Ray in the process of getting divorced from his wife Emma (Carla Gugino Wayward Pines) has agreed to drive his college-bound daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario True Detective) from Los Angeles to San Francisco. But then Ray is pulled back to work when Nevada gets the shakes and Blake ends up flying to the Bay Area in the company of her moms rich new boyfriend Daniel (Ioan Gruffudd) a smooth-talking developer who just happens to be constructing the tallest building in San Francisco.While waiting in Daniels San Francisco office Blake has a meet-cute moment with a bright-eyed young wanna-be architect Ben (Hugo Johnstone-Burt Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries) there from England for a job interview and his younger brother Ollie (Art Parkinson Game of Thrones).Meanwhile back in L.A. at Cal Tech the Chief Seismologist Who No One Will Listen To Lawrence (Paul Giamatti) -- who predicted the Nevada quake that took down Hoover Dam and killed his colleague -- is now even more alarmed by new information showing that the entire San Andreas Fault is going to rip open like a cheap shirt. This could be the largest quake in recorded history one that will tear California apart and send tremors all the way to the East Coast.Its lucky then that he just happens to have a local news crew headed by Serena (Archie Panjabi The Good Wife) in his office interviewing him about his predictive abilities.Then the ground starts heaving forcing Ray to abandon all occupational responsibilties. Instead he uses his chopper to rescue his soon-to-be-ex-wife from the top of a collapsing L.A. skyscraper and then heads to San Francisco to save his daughter.With its stock off-the-shelf characters (shy but brave Ben has the heart of a lion; cowardly and wealthy Daniel doesnt) and contrived situations that strain credibility San Andreas fits right into the disaster-flick mold as more theme-park thrill ride than movie. Top it off with the requisite messages about family patriotism and rebuilding and the film touches all the bases.But theres one way in which San Andreas differs from its 70s predecessors such as The Towering Inferno or Earthquake. Those featured big famous stars of the day dealing with calamity while here -- with the exception of Johnson and Giamatti --the cast list is more likely to prompt such reactions as ""Hey dont I know them from [insert random TV series here]?""Thats not necessarily a bad thing. But it just shows where Peyton and crew wanted to spend their bucks. Judging from the results they got their moneys worth.

As we sat on his deck catching up over a beer I couldnt help but notice just how precarious this idyllic setting was--high up and supported by creaky timber stilts that felt as sturdy as chewed toothpicks. He must have noticed the uneasy look on my face because he then launched into a monologue about how folks out there had been talking a lot lately about their fears that an earthquake was long overdue. Not just a minor event but The Big One. When he was finished two thoughts ran through my head First if and when this major quake came this place was going to be toast. And second that the marketing team behind San Andreas had gotten their psychic meat hooks into him bad. Hollywood disaster movies have been around since the birth of moving pictures. The only difference between then and now is how much bigger and better our cinematic destruction has gotten. The most fertile wave of celluloid disaster porn came in the 1970s when maestros of mayhem like producer Irwin Allen churned out star-studded cataclysms like The Poseidon Adventure and The Towering Inferno. One of the best - and by best I mean most cheesily entertaining - was Charlton Hestons 1974 hit Earthquake which turned L.A. into a Sensurround pile of Styrofoam rubble. For audiences at a safe remove from Californias ever-shifting and cranky tectonic plates movies like Earthquake were pure escapism with a splash of schadenfreude. After all there had to be a price for all of that sunshine right? But for Angelenos these films cut deeper. They were a primal reckoning with Mother Natures wrath. San Andreas is just the latest shake rattle and roll tentpole to grapple with these anxieties. And as patently preposterous scientifically dubious and unapologetically corny as director Brad Peytons orgy of CGI devastation is its popcorn prophecy of the inevitable is a blast of giddy disposable fun. Its a ridiculously satisfying slice of summer disaster porn. Taking the reins from Heston the onetime posterboy of stoic can-do heroism is Dwayne Johnson. With his air of alpha-male invincibility hes given the chance to step out from the ensemble shadow of the Fast and Furious films and topline his own shock-and-awe laser show. And while the role isnt exactly Hamlet its a gig he seems born for. Johnson stars as Ray Gaines a cool-under-pressure Afghan War vet-turned-daredevil leader of the Los Angeles Fire Departments Search and Rescue team. Hes the kind of guy who can lower a helicopter into a ravine and snatch a young woman trapped in a hanging car from the jaws of death without breaking a sweat and later laugh the whole thing off like Evel Knievel. Hes also as the Hollywood disaster film playbook dictates a good man with an ex-wife (Carla Gugino) a college-age daughter he dotes on (Alexandra Daddario) and an unhealed tragedy in his past involving another daughter who he could not save from a white-water rafting accident. Hes a haunted hero with a heart of gold and biceps of granite. As he runs around saving lives trying to make peace with his past a Cal Tech seismologist (Paul Giamatti delivering grave arias of spurious scientific exposition) is busy mapping a spike in subterranean activity that threatens to turn the Left Coast into mincemeat. This impending apocalypse first strikes in Nevada destroying the Hoover Dam and taking the life of his trusty research partner. Then he quickly learns that this is all just an appetizer for something bigger...way bigger - a massive 9.0-plus event running up the spine of California. Los Angeles San Francisco and everywhere in between is about to be leveled by a quake of Shiva Destroyer of Worlds-like proportions. The race is afoot. Complicating matters for Johnsons Ray is the fact that his daughter has traveled up to the Bay Area with his exs snaky superrich fiance (Ioan Gruffudd). Shes too far away for him to do much to rescue her. Or is she? Disaster movies have always been to some degree melodramatic soap operas sandwiched between eye-popping action set pieces. And San Andreas written by Losts Carlton Cuse isnt very interested in messing with that formula. The plot essentially boils down to a family-values saga where husband and ex-wife put aside their differences to save their child and restore domestic harmony. But what makes the film work (to the extent it does) is its giddy stretches of rack and ruin. Skyscrapers topple like Jenga towers. Tsunamis level the Golden Gate Bridge. Cruise ships get tossed like kids bathtub toys. And it all delivers an uneasy primal jolt. In the wake of Mad Max Fury Road a lot of ink has been spilled about the superiority of old-school practical effects over pixelated CGI flash. And theres some truth in that argument. But between its groan-inducing human moments San Andreas shows that sometimes the fake stuff can get the job done beautifully. I dont want to make any claims that San Andreas is a great film. Its not. But as mindless sensory barrages go its fakery taps into something real It shows us just how impotent we all are to control our planet. Unless of course you happen to be The Rock.

"San Andreas review Demolition day - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies San Andreas review Demolition derby San Andreas Jasin Boland Carla Gugino left and Dwayne Johnson star in the earthquake disaster film ""San Andreas."" Carla Gugino left and Dwayne Johnson star in the earthquake disaster film ""San Andreas."" (Jasin Boland) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune A 9.6 on the Richter scale cant stop Dwayne Johnson from making his family whole again. The fault dear Brutus is not in our stars. The fault is the star of ""San Andreas"" a fairly entertaining weapon of mass destruction reminding us that lifes blessings come to those who receive preferential billing.We may as well call it ""Its a Mad Mad Mad Mad Earthquake"" though the tremors in ""San Andreas"" arent so much mad as disappointed. So many Californians to wipe out in only 107 minutes of screen time Thats 51 minutes shorter than Roland Emmerichs schlocktastic ""2012."" The screenwriter Carlton Cuse (""Lost"") and the director Brad Peyton respect the essential hypocrisy required by any half-decent disaster movie. Thousands may die anonymous painful deaths but as long as we give a damn-ette about the fates of the central characters then we can forget about the community at large.Director Peyton helmed ""Mysterious Island 2"" and ""Cats amp; Dogs 2"" two of the more grating sequels in recent memory. Its a small miracle therefore that ""San Andreas"" manages to sustain some interest along its narrative fault lines. Dwayne Johnson plays Ray the LA Fire Department rescue honcho whos on the phone up in his helicopter talking to his ex Emma played by Carla Gugino when one of a series of Big Ones unleashes its digital fury. Most of the film concerns Ray and Emmas attempts to rescue college-bound daughter Blake played by Alexandra Daddario from an untimely death. (Her sister drowned years earlier.) Blakes up in scenic soon-to-be-leveled San Francisco with her mothers sniveling developer boyfriend. The latters portrayed by Ioan Gruffudd who gets to say the crucial bad-guy line in any earthquake movie ""Get out of my way""Others behave nobly under pressure. Paul Giamattis the Cal Tech professor who can really holler like a pro when its time to encourage extras to take cover under the nearest desk. His character learns how to predict unspeakable seismic activity (i.e. ""a swarm event"" as he says invoking the glory days of 70s disaster movie impresario Irwin Allen) a little too late but you know. ""A"" for effort.

(Alicia Chang) ""San Andreas"" imagines the insanely destructive possibilities inherent in a 9.6 quake plus the inevitable tsunami. The effects are quite good which isnt the same as saying the scenarios are freshly imagined. The film has the usual 21st century disinterest in selectivity or pacing. It opens with a cliffhanger the result of an idiot motorist texting while driving. She plunges off a cliff deservedly in the films eyes though Johnsons crew is there when she needs them. As for the antagonist Gruffudd clearly took night classes in petulant villainy wherever Richard Chamberlain in ""The Towering Inferno"" received his training.I enjoyed large chunks of ""San Andreas"" largely because the actors give it a full load of sincerity and theres some bizarrely effective comic relief thanks to Hugo Johnstone-Burt and Art Parkinson as Brits who picked the wrong week to visit the Bay Area. I freely acknowledge that watching ""San Andreas"" took me back to my own misspent early adolescence. When I was 13 I saw ""Earthquake"" while sitting inside one of the massive Sensurround speakers. Kid you not. Havent been quite right since.

It was San Franciscos ATamp;T Park. This version has been updated. Directed by Brad Peyton ""San Andreas"" stars Dwayne Johnson as a helicopter pilot determined to find his daughter after a devastating earthquake hits California. The film premieres May 29 2015. (New Line Cinema) By Michael OSullivan May 28 2015 The disaster movie of the 1970s hasnt gotten any better just better looking. Set during a record-breaking 9.6 magnitude earthquake along Californias most infamous fault line ""San Andreas"" is a triumph of CGI mayhem as Los Angeles buildings topple like stacks of Jenga bricks a tsunami threatens San Francisco Bay and a yawning chasm opens in the earth between them as if a zipper had been drawn through Bakersfield. Its viscerally thrilling to behold especially in 3-D. Scarier still is how stagnant the genre has gotten in every other aspect. The dialogue in ""San Andreas"" is lame its plot both predictable and implausible and the character development beside the point. Even Dwayne Johnson that force of cinematic nature and rock-ribbed charisma doesnt have enough charm to dig this mess of a movie out of the rubble of cliche its buried in. [2015 Summer Movie Guide] Johnson plays Ray a hot-shot helicopter pilot with L.A. Fire and Rescue. Barely two minutes in he and his cocky crew are introduced to us as they pluck a teenager from her car after it has gone off the road and is hanging from a cliff. The situation is dangerous but the chopper crews breezy banter in the face of death keeps things light. Dwayne Johnson stars as Ray who leads his estranged wife (Carla Gugino) to safety -- hes still her rock in a crisis -- in ""San Andreas."" (Jasin Boland/Warner Bros. Entertainment) This is one of the most annoying things about ""San Andreas."" The dialogue is inappropriately jocular throughout which undercuts the genuine terror it attempts to muster. After the quake starts and Ray has deposited his estranged wife Emma (Carla Gugino) in the middle of ATamp;T Park via parachute he turns to her and cracks wise ""Its been a while since I got you to second base."" This as human beings all around them are being pancaked by chunks of falling masonry the size of train cars. One human being you might not mind seeing flattened is Emmas new boyfriend Daniel (Ioan Gruffudd). The films stock villain Daniel is a heartless developer who turns tail and runs as soon as the ground starts trembling leaving Ray and Emmas daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario) trapped under a cement beam in the parking garage beneath one of his buildings. Thankfully Blake is ministered to by a cute Brit named Ben (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) and his little brother Ollie (Art Parkinson). These characters along with Paul Giamattis Chicken Little-like seismologist get introduced one by one during a formulaic prologue -- as they always do in such things -- and before the film starts shaking them up. After that it matters little who they are or what their back stories or agendas may be. Theres plenty of downtime for Ray and Emma to talk about what went wrong with their marriage as they search for Blake -- who by this point is imperiled by some other nightmare -- but no one really cares. Ooh look at the Golden Gate Bridge get smashed In plot ""San Andreas"" parallels the climate-change thriller ""The Day After Tomorrow"" in which Dennis Quaids climatologist hero trudged preposterously from D.C. to New York in a blizzard to rescue his son (Jake Gyllenhaal). Here Ray travels from Los Angeles to San Francisco -- by chopper car plane and boat -- to save Blake. Never mind that he doesnt know where she is in a city of more than 800000 and with only 47 square miles to cover before the movie ends. As Ben says to Blake just before smooching her in gratitude for pulling a shard of broken glass from his thigh ""Youre absolutely unbelievable."" PG-13. At area theaters. Contains cataclysmic destruction and some crude language. 114 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

(Jasin Boland) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Thursday May 28 2015 1042 AM Title San Andreas Film Info A rescue pilot saves his family from earthquakes. Director Brad Peyton (155). PG Catastrophic violence. Area theaters. ""San Andreas"" is a disaster -- literally. Thats not to take a piece out of Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson. His charm and family-man-style fearlessness as the movies star is the only saving grace in this thuddingly repetitive badly written crash-a-thon. Johnson plays Ray Gaines an L.A. police and fire rescue pilot. He still loves his soon-to-be-ex-wife Emma (Carla Gugino) despite her divorce filing. But Ray is about to have bigger issues. The tectonic plates along the San Andreas fault are shifting and preparing to cause off-the-charts earthquakes as a bearded hysterical Caltech scientist (Paul Giamatti) tells a newswoman. San Francisco he warns is really in for it It happens that Ray and Emmas collegiate daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario) is being dropped off in San Francisco with Emmas awful rich boyfriend Daniel (Ioan Gruffud). Once skyscrapers start toppling Emma and Ray fly his copter drive and hop a motorboat to save Blake. Paul Giamatti (l.) and Archie Panjabi take cover in ""San Andreas."" (Jasin Boland) But Blake in a nod to 70s precursors ""Earthquake"" and ""The Towering Inferno"" is having a potential romance with twit-ish Brit Ben (Hugo Johnstone-Burt). Bens precocious little brother Ollie (Art Parkinson) pushes the young folks together even as they flee fiery falling steel. Are we still so wowed by standard competent CGI that we put up with stick-figure storylines? Is Hoover Dams destruction really such a big-ticket item? Johnson working with director Brad Peyton (they teamed on the enjoyable 2012 kids movie ""Journey 2 The Mysterious Island"") doesnt shirk his responsibilities Hes heroic funny tough and tender the qualities that made him a star. But everything else is a shambles. Daddario and Johnstone-Burts wide-eyed looks of fear arent convincing. (Blake at least is a survival-minded woman who can bandage wounds and find higher ground.) Giamatti spends a lot of time hiding from debris under tables. The barest of effort is made to make things believable. Carla Gugino and Dwayne Johnson race to safety in a scene from ""San Andreas."" (Jasin Boland) Granted this isnt a realistic film its a ride. Which is fine -- its just not a very good one. The urbanized mayhem with very few human faces endangered avoids potentially troubling echoes of last months deadly earthquake in Nepal. The major takeaway is a huge tidal wave that changes the California coast. That scene like a few others has a vapor-thin environmental message but not so much that any ticket buyers might feel alienated. Whats left is just destruction for destructions sake with cardboard characters impossible to knock down. If anyone says ""Whoa"" when water comes rushing down a street theyve probably never watched the Weather Channel. jneumaiernydailynews.com Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" throughout the day Thurs. - Sun. on New Yorks WOR 710 AM and at wor710.com.

San Andreas Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2015) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/san-andreas-2015,200,sanandreas34,sanandreas,rogerebert
"San Andreas (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review San Andreas (PG-13) Dwayne Johnson is wasted in this by-the-numbers spectacle starring lots of collapsing buildings. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com5/27/2015 Editor rating 1 In San Andreas The Big One finally hits California and not even Dwayne Johnsons mutant biceps can keep those infamous tectonic plates from separating (although it would have been great if the movie had thrown in a scene showing him try like Samson pulling down the pillars). This is pure Disaster 101 formula although distilled to the minimum amount of dialogue and characters possible. Compared to San Andreas 1974s cheesy epic Earthquake with Charlton Heston comes off like The Godfather (parts I and II combined). Instead director Brad Peyton (Journey 2 The Mysterious Island) settles for an endless series of shots of skyscrapers and bridges and highways crumbling sending millions of nameless faceless people to horrible deaths. But who cares about them when search-and-rescue helicopter pilot Ray (Johnson) is scrambling to save his soon-to-be ex wife (Carla Gugino) and their two kids who are somewhere in the city as its falling down like it did in Roland Emmerichs 2012? Yes the gigantic CGI effects are aces but at this point bungling this sort of thing would be inexcusable (and to give Emmerich props nothing in San Andreas beats that long sequence in 2012 of John Cusack driving his ex-wife and kids through L.A. as it collapses around them). Johnson the kind of rare action star who has genuine magnetism and movie-star chops spends half the picture inside his helicopter which is akin to casting Jason Statham to play a nun. Whats the point? San Andreas does score points for not throwing in any cheap villains for the sake of a plot Even though they are about to divorce Johnson and Gugino are so sweet and nice to each other that they might as well be on their honeymoon -- and thats long before the earthquake strikes. The only bad guy in San Andreas is Ioan Gruffudd as a wealthy land developer who is a cowardly cretin because in the destruction-film genre architects and designers are almost always cowardly cretins. At routine intervals the movie cuts away to a scientist played by Paul Giamatti whose sole purpose in the film is to make sure the audience understands just how serious this earthquake is by spouting breathless exposition disguised as scientific jargon (""Its a 9.5 on the Richter scale""). Giamatti also warns that even though the quake is originating in California the shock waves will be so monstrous that they will reach the East Coast. But either the screenwriters forgot to follow that subplot through or the filmmakers ran out of money because by the time the end credits roll every city from Miami to New York is still standing as if nothing had happened. San Andreas isnt bad enough to laugh at although I did chuckle at the scene in which singer Kylie Minogue suddenly popped up for no apparent reason. I was braced for her to break out into the Love Theme from San Andreas but before she could even clear her throat she falls off the side of a building never to reappear. San Andreas was shot partly in Australia so maybe her cameo was part of whatever tax incentives that country offers. But the bulk of this huge visually impressive and aggressively stupid movie could have been shot in someones basement and the overall effect would have still been the same Been there done that tired of it. Also whats with the films lazy approach to its few character deaths? They come off as afterthoughts as if the script supervisor said ""Oh yeah we forgot about this guy"" Even The Poseidon Adventure was decent enough to send off Shelley Winters with a great hammy exit. At least San Andreas does offer one new message Massive earthquakes can bring broken families together. When you manage to live through the biggest disaster in our planets history what is there left to do but go in for a group hug? Cast Dwayne Johnson Carla Gugino Alexandra Daddario Ioan Gruffudd Archie Panjabi Paul Giamatti Kylie Minogue. Director Brad Peyton. Screenwriter Carlton Cuse. A Warner Bros. release. Running time 114 minutes. Brief vulgar language depictions of mass destruction and peril that look a lot like outtakes from the big finale of The Avengers. Playing at area theaters.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Anyone wondering whether there might be a degree of artistry to what Roland Emmerich does should look no further than San Andreas an earthquake disaster movie made in the Emmerich style complete with divorced protagonist and obliterated landmarks but lacking the blockbuster crafters sense of scale or knack for composing mayhem memorably. Handsomely shot by Steve Yedlin Rian Johnsons regular cinematographer and boasting a typically likable Dwayne Johnson as its star San Andreas nonetheless struggles to drum up tension or interest even as skyscrapers topple like Jenga towers and massive tidal waves sweep through San Francisco Bay. Johnson plays Ray Gaines a Los Angeles Fire Department helicopter pilot who finds himself racing across California after a series of massive earthquakes and aftershocks leave ex-wife Emma (Carla Gugino) trapped in downtown L.A. and daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario) pinned down in an underground parking garage in San Francisco. Barring a cool digitally composited long take--in which the camera flies in through the window of a shaking building and follows Emma as she makes her way to the roof--director Brad Peyton (Journey 2 The Mysterious Island Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge Of Kitty Galore) cant seem to connect his characters to the destruction unfolding around them. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that he rarely frames them in wide shot instead intercutting close-ups with all-CGI spreads of crumbling destruction the scale thrown further out of whack by 3-D. Or maybe its just a lack of showmanship--that semi-disreputable P.T. Barnum craft of getting the audience primed to see a container ship crash into the Golden Gate Bridge or making them appreciate the idea of a toppling high rise narrowly missing the heroes. Here buildings collapse millions presumably die and a small handful of boring characters escape danger again and again. Meanwhile Johnson flashes his winning smile and Kylie Minogue repeats her Holy Motors role by appearing in one scene that ends with her falling off a building.The script by Carlton Cuse (Bates Motel Lost) trades in Relatable 101 generics framing a 9.5 Richter scale earthquake as the story of a nuclear family under attack both from within (see Emmas rich new boyfriend played by Ioan Gruffudd) and without. Even the above-average cast--with Paul Giamatti livening things up as the requisite concerned-scientist/exposition-delivery-machine--cant seem to make it work as anything more than a series of reasons to get from point A to point B. Which should be fine given that its how disaster movies generally play but Peyton cant sustain suspense past the first earthquake scene set at Hoover Dam.After that its hard to appreciate San Andreas as much more than a series of special effects vistas impeccably detailed completely plastic. A prop plane crashes into a mall full of looters speedboats race to get over the swell of a tsunami before it crests power lines hiss out sparks as they snap across a San Francisco hill and its all staged in a way that somehow manages to look good without being exciting. By the point when an American flag unfurls to a rah-rah swell before the cut to credits a viewers lizard-brain--the same part that appreciates parkour and clicky robots--has probably long checked out.

Photo Warner Bros. Pictures MOVIE REVIEW San Andreas Running time 104 minutes. Rated PG-13 (disaster mayhem and swearing). In the idiotic new disaster movie ""San Andreas"" a woman trusts her fiance to bring her daughter back to college -- only to have him leave the girl trapped in the parking garage of a crumbling San Francisco skyscraper when the Big One hits. Luckily for that mother (Carla Gugino) her estranged husband is a search-and-rescue helicopter pilot played by Dwayne Johnson. Not only can he pluck her from the top of a wrecked Los Angeles tower but the pair make their way to Frisco via the helicopter a stolen SUV a small plane and a ""borrowed"" speed boat for a reunion with their daughter that will involve even more much improbable heroics. Alexandra Daddario and Dwayne Johnson.Photo Jasin Boland Oblivious to both narrative logic and the laws of physics the cliche-filled ""San Andreas"" doesnt nearly have the star power of earlier better disaster movies it borrows from like ""The Poseidon Adventure"" ""Earthquake"" and ""The Towering Inferno"" -- which featured Paul Newman as the towers architect a role played here by an embarrassed-looking Ioan Gruffudd (as Guginos fiance). All of these movies made at least a pretense at characterization which in ""San Andreas"" consists pretty much entirely of Johnson and Gugino having soulful talks while heading north about the earlier drowning death of another daughter. But then this is what amounts to ""The Love Boat"" of disaster movies. Their surviving daughter (Alexandra Daddario of TVs ""True Detective"") is fortunate enough to have hooked up with a guy (Hugh Johnstone-Burt) who has a cute British accent and an even cuter younger brother (Art Parkinson) minutes before her would-be stepfather flees in a panic. Though shes only 19 she shows the amazed Brit brothers how to operate a rotary phone. Paul Giamatti and Archie PanjabiPhoto Jasin Boland Theres a romantic interest provided even for Paul Giamatti -- as an apparently widowed seismologist who saves vastly more lives than Johnson does by ordering the evacuation of San Francisco after the screenwriters fancifully decide Californias 800-mile-long San Andreas fault extends all the way into Nevada for the sole purpose of demolishing the Hoover Dam. Shes a beautiful TV reporter (Archie Panjabi of ""The Good Wife"") whom Giamatti invites to take shelter under a desk during tremors. The special effects arent bad for a lower-budget (100 million) blockbuster though director Brad Peyton and his writers often deploy them in downright laughable ways. At one point Johnson pilots the speedboat over the top of a tsunami then effortlessly cruises through newly flooded streets presumably filled with debris from toppled buildings. Even after Gugino smashes the boat through a huge plate glass window it remains astonishingly shipshape. The briskly paced ""San Andreas works as a sort of guilty pleasure -- but you may feel more guilt than you bargained for from a film where the Golden Gate Bridge is demolished primarily (minor spoiler here) as a colorful vehicle for karmic payback to Guginos slimy architect fiance.

"Review San Andreas is crazy stupid fun - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview San Andreas is crazy stupid funBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News correspondentPosted 05/27/2015 110640 AM PDTUpdated 05/27/2015 010129 PM PDT Its becoming a habit. Nearly every summer movie season means Hollywood will destroy San Francisco.Filmmakers happily pulverized the Bay Area and its landmarks in the 2014 ""Godzilla"" reboot. And they sicced avenging simians on the regions pricey real estate in 2011s ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" and 2014s ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes."" Now with ""San Andreas"" starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson"" Hollywood hammers the City by the Bay with the power of a Buster Posey grand slam. Director Brad Peyton and his special effects team work overtime at utterly and ridiculously annihilating San Francisco. They create a swarm of quakes along the San Andreas Fault that coalesce into a 9.6 behemoth and top that off with a gargantuan tsunami. (L-R) Carla Gugino as Emma and Dwayne Johnson as Ray in San Andreas. (Jasin Boland/Warner Bros.) ( Jasin Boland/Warner Bros. ) To be fair San Francisco isnt alone here. Los Angeles and even slabs of Nevada (the Hoover Dam turns to mush) also take it on the chin in the numbskulled snicker-worthy ""San Andreas"" a 3-D extravaganza with cataclysmic scoops of good-golly CGI Cheez-Whiz dialogue and one-note characters. Much of what happens on screen defies logic especially the derring-do antics summoned to get our heroes out of pickles. But that doesnt matter much. What does in this genre is mayhem -- towering buildings buckling and crashing to the ground terrorized folk running here there and everywhere. You get more than your fill of that here.Advertisement Fans of disaster films such as 1974s ""Earthquake"" with Charlton Heston Irwin Allens 1974 ""The Towering Inferno"" (also set in San Francisco) and Roland Emmerichs much better ""2012"" will get their itch for destruction scratched with ""San Andreas."" Others should stay home and work on their earthquake preparedness kit.With a screenplay that serves as a shaky bridge to the action this is a guilty pleasure that is manufactured more than crafted. Once you realize that your best bet is to go with the flow and enjoy the unintentional laughs for all they are worth.What makes this archetypical disaster film fun is its cast. Theres Paul Giamatti as the sweaty town crier professor and scientist Lawrence Hayes. After a quake slams Los Angeles hes figured out that the Big One is yet to come and hopes to get his warning heard nationwide via reporter Serena (Archie Panjabi).Both are supporting players in ""San Andreas"" as screenwriters Carlton Cuse Andre Fabrizio and Jeremy Passmore latch onto one familys ordeal. Which brings us to the immensely likable Johnson who plays heroic earnest and (of course) buff valiant family man and Los Angeles rescue copter pilot Ray Gaines. Ray is out to not only save his plucky daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario) who gets stuck in San Francisco with her moms sinfully wealthy beau (Ioan Gruffudd wasted in a nothing role) when the quake hits. He also is intent on mending his broken marriage with Emma (Carla Gugino). Thats a lot on his personal Richter scale to handle but this is the Rock and he can handle it. It helps that he seems be well aware that this is schlock and is having fun with it all.Per usual there are silly brushes with romance too including Blakes encounter with the handsome Ben (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) who is on a job interview/vacation with his brother Ollie (Art Parkinson). When the kiss finally comes between Blake and Ben you cant help but roll your eyes.As for the story line there are faults and cracks aplenty. But ""San Andreas"" does know where its epicenter must be overdone loud anything-but-realistic and enthusiastic destruction sequences. It is here that ""San Andreas"" stands on somewhat solid ground.

Mother Nature always gets the last word but dont tell that to the filmmakers of San Andreas who envision California bravely persevering after a series of earthquakes of unprecedented severity erupt along the titular fault line. West-coasters are known for their often nonchalant attitude toward disasters but Warner Bros. third big-budget release of May is far too upbeat in the face of catastrophe to spur any tectonic shift in perspective. While San Andreas wont exactly tip the Richter scale it will clearly inject some fresh PG-13 action into theaters and could still resonate with crowds gearing up for summer vacation. Any feature inclined toward a realistic depiction of a monster earthquake is wise to stick with first-responders so San Andreas gives us Ray (Dwayne Johnson) an Los Angeles Fire Department search and rescue helicopter pilot. Rays expertise aloft isnt matched by his interpersonal skills though as hes reminded when his estranged wife Emma (Carla Gugino) serves him with divorce papers and announces shes moving into her wealthy boyfriend Daniels (Ioan Gruffudd) fancy mansion along with their daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario). Rays plans for spending a final weekend with Blake before she begins university in the San Francisco area are dashed when a major earthquake hits Nevada and his squad mobilizes to respond -- while Daniel offers to fly Blake up north on his private jet. See more Watch the Trailers for 8 of Mays Most Anticipated Movies The LAFD isnt aware however that the Nevada quake is part of a ""swarm"" of tremblors headed toward LA as predicted by Lawrence Hayes (Paul Giamatti) a seismology professor at CalTech. Before Hayes can get word out to the public however the first big one hits downtown where Emma is lunching in a highrise restaurant as the building begins crumbling around her. Already airborne and flying solo Ray plucks her from the roof in his chopper and they impulsively zip off to retrieve their daughter. Blake has already reached San Francisco when another quake hits and she finds herself trapped in an underground garage. After managing to reach Ray by cell phone with her location shes rescued by handsome Brit engineer Ben (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) and his younger brother Ollie (Art Parkinson). The three quickly flee into the marginally safer streets of San Francisco and start developing a plan to rendezvous with Ray and Emma. Although the geological principals that underlie the plot are fairly solid the film predictably exaggerates them to apocalytic proportions as earthquakes split California apart with a zipper-like effect. Those particulars may be of little concern to audiences but some may raise an eyebrow at Rays dereliction of duty as an active-duty LAFD pilot who ignores orders and go AWOL on a personal mission with one of the departments helicopters. No matter the extended trip north gives Ray and Emma a chance to sort out their failing marriage as they make a beeline for their daughter. Read more DreamWorks Nabs Dwayne Johnson Sci-Fi Action Comedy Alpha Squad Seven Unpacking all of that personal baggage makes for an uneasy fit with the action-adventure scenario and the movie is at its strongest when it integrates family dynamics into the plot rather than indulging in extreme couples therapy. Johnson is totally up for it however remaining one of the few contemporary action stars who can reassuringly embrace emotional situations at the height of catastrophe. When hes not being vulnerable while hashing out his marital issues he gives the type of heroic alpha-male performance weve come to reliably expect along with the occasional twinkle of characteristic humor. Gugino and Daddario are no slouches either barreling full-bore through physically intense scenes that are no less demanding for all their liberally deployed special effects. Together with cinematographer Steve Yedlin and VFX supervisor Colin Strause director Brad Peyton achieves a persuasive blending of practical shots and superior CG techniques for the most complex sequences which may leave some viewers holding onto their seats for stability (the movie will be released in 3D in select theaters.) The scale of the spectacle is often disproportionate to the destruction depicted however with few scenes of the inevitable death and trauma that follow a major earthquake. So if San Andreas eventually emerges as a feel-good disaster movie it probably just reflects our aspirations for maintaining order in the inevitable chaos of a catastrophic quake. Wishful thinking indeed.

May 26 2015 | 1100PM PT California crumbles spectacularly in an action movie that quickly degenerates from blissfully stupid to fatally stupid. Of the many charges that can be levied against Brad Peytons ""San Andreas"" false advertising is not one of them. The disaster pic promises nothing more than the complete CGI destruction of California as foregrounded by Dwayne Johnsons jackfruit-sized biceps and it delivers exactly that. After providing some blissfully stupid B-movie thrills for its first hour the film suffers from spectacle overkill (you know whats cooler than an apocalyptic earthquake? Two apocalyptic earthquakes ... and a tsunami) and a fatal lack of invention in its second more concerned with toppling buildings one by one than ever drumming up a lick of suspense about the fates of those inside them. Still ""San Andreas"" boasts an undeniable sort of pre-verbal lizard-brain appeal that should make it a strong earner especially in territories far removed from the titular fault line. Hewing much closer to Roland Emmerichs teenage symphonies to Shiva than to the more conscientious disaster-pic approach of Juan Antonio Bayonas ""The Impossible"" ""San Andreas"" is the kind of film that can imply the violent deaths of millions of innocent people without batting an eye just so long as the five or six Californians who matter make it out with only cuts and bruises. The recent earthquake in Nepal might make that proposition a bit dicier offering a reminder that catastrophic natural disasters arent exactly well fun. (The film was forced to retool some of its marketing materials as a result.) But as thoroughly cheesy and mindless as it is ""San Andreas"" certainly isnt glib about its central calamity and no one is lining up expecting documentary realism anyway. In any case the five or six characters whose lives matter are as follows. Ray (Johnson) is a hulking heroic helicopter pilot who segued from flying missions in Afghanistan to performing search-and-rescue operations in Los Angeles. His soon-to-be-ex-wife Emma (Carla Gugino) has shacked up with uber-rich building developer Daniel (Ioan Gruffudd) who is busy constructing the tallest sturdiest skyscraper in San Francisco (this bit of information may be useful later). Ray and Emma have a college-aged daughter named Blake (Alexandra Daddario) who thumbs a ride up to the Bay Area on Daniels private jet where she meets cute with fumbling flustering British twentysomething Ben (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) and his obnoxious wisecracking younger brother Ollie (Art Parkinson). Meanwhile a Cal Tech seismologist (Paul Giamatti) prone to muttering science-y gibberish under his breath while drawing lots of diagrams heads off to Nevada to study a recent flurry of ""mini-quakes."" These jolts give him the data he needs to predict future earthquakes -- ""something-something magnetic pulses mumble-mumble"" -- moments before a sudden trembler takes out the Hoover Dam. Hes just arrived back in Pasadena to put his theories into practice when the entire San Andreas fault lights up with warning signs indicating the Big One is imminent. Well aware that it isnt the science thats bringing butts into the seats director Peyton makes the most of this first cataclysm. As the assembled characters dodge debris and do lots of screaming -- the quake demolishes L.A. and San Francisco simultaneously -- Peyton shows us both the computer-scaled chaos (well rendered if indistinguishable from the similar destruction present in every disaster pic and comicbook film of the past half-decade) as well as some glimpses at more immediate epicenters. Its the little details that are more memorable such as the unaware airborne Ray glancing down to see a freeway interchange silently crumble or a long tracking shot through a luxury rooftop lounge as Emma pushes past frantic waitresses and flaming kitchen staff in search of safety. (Shot partially in Australia the film carves out a strange cameo role here for Aussie pop star Kylie Minogue After ""Holy Motors"" ""San Andreas"" is Minogues second consecutive film in which she appears for a single scene then promptly falls off a roof.) Ray plucks Emma from the top of a crumbling building in his chopper while Ben and Ollie pull Blake from a crumbling parking garage. (For all the screenplays attempts to make Blake the resourceful survivalist of her little band shes still invariably the one getting saved.) After learning that Blake is temporarily safe Ray and Emma resolve to head up to San Francisco to rescue her themselves. With the earthquake having passed its here that the film ought to stir up some novel perils to test and develop its characters and the aftermath of an earthquake should provide plenty of dangers -- gas leaks explosions fires riots slightly worse traffic etc. Instead the film simply doubles down on its initial gambit as Giamattis scientist discovers that the biggest most devastating quake in American history is merely a precursor for a bigger more most-devastating quake that could turn California into Arizona Bay at any moment. Thanks to this lack of tension -- when two major world cities lie in ruins its hard to get too worked up over the danger of the rubble re-collapsing -- the film drifts off in its last hour. Ray and Emma have a few quiet moments together though theyre largely wasted dealing with the recriminations of a needless backstory. Meanwhile Blake and Ben develop a nervous sort of romance as they trudge through the streets with Blake losing a new article of clothing at every aftershock. Bay Area natives will surely chuckle at some of the geographic oddities here as the trio consult a map to find their way from Chinatown to Coit Tower a landmark that ought to be easily visible simply by looking up. Daddario maintains a bright screen presence and she manages to keep her half of the narrative afloat well enough yet Johnson is the main attraction. Best utilized when hes allowed to arch his famous right eyebrow at the tumult unfolding around him Johnson affects a more solemn Stallonian presence here and hes as solid an action hero as ever. Still one can almost sense the actor breathing a sigh of relief when after parachuting into the infield of ATamp;T Park with Emma he gets to quip ""Its been a while since I got you to second base."" The line is dumb forehead-slapping and totally out of sync with the rest of ""San Andreas."" Its also the best thing in it. Film Review San AndreasReviewed at Warner Bros.

Sandra Sean says July 17 2016 at 932 am Ahh...just finished watching this oh so predictable movie. The expressions on The Rocks face simply cracked me up (scuse the pun) Best laugh Ive had for ages. I imagine him getting into character by thinking to himself ""what am I doing in this crummy film?"" Well we all know the answer to that one; money of course. But heres the strangest thing this movie made a fortune at the box office If B.S. like San Andreas can be successful then ol Donald will be a shoe-in for Pres. Someone get me a rocket-I need to get off this dumb planet. San Andreas? Distracting pabulum at best. Reply Jack says December 2 2015 at 855 am I just cant care that much for a leading character a rescue pilot who basically steals the LAFD helicopter his is supposed to be using to help Angelinos during the worst catastrophe in the citys history. After pulling his wife (and no one else) from the roof of a collapsing building in downtown LA the couple heads to San Francisco a 5 or 6 hour flight for the sole purpose of rescuing their daughter and not giving a fig about anyone else. Reply Debbie Henry says October 27 2015 at 914 am This was by far the BEST edge of your seat film I have ever watched. Unreal yes cg generated yes. But all through the entire movie my hands were ringing and could not sit still to watch each action scene every rescue and the fast paced non-stop action throughout the movie. It left me wanting more. Reply Phil says November 4 2015 at 1005 pm good grief Reply Ethan says February 28 2016 at 101 pm GOOD GOD YOU HAVE NO BRAIN Please pull the heroin needle out of your arm and find the nearest education institute Abbey Scheer says October 17 2015 at 412 pm Your basic disaster movie...It focused in on 1 particular family to keep the story line going. If it branched out to a million other people saving others it wouldnt have worked. And you have to remember it was just a movie It didnt have to be detail accurate. Pretty good I only took 2 cigarette breaks. Reply Phil says November 4 2015 at 1008 pm Fortunately my Netflix DVD copy stalled during two (unimportant) scenes...at which time I managed to get in two extended back-porch cigar sessions. Reply Old Mate (o1dm8) says October 11 2015 at 838 pm Lighten up folks its a movie The SFX are incredible. Truly an awesome production highly recommended. Reply Maury Kei Manna says September 30 2015 at 834 am Can a fireman steal a rescue chopper and fly around saving just the people he wants? And then abandon his duty and go to another city just because he wants to? Reply Phil says November 4 2015 at 1011 pm Maury the answer is YES Anything goes in a flicker geared for the 13-25 year old crowd (25 is pushing it). Reply Joe says September 28 2015 at 104 am Im glad that i didnt see it in the theater the worst movie ever It doesnt even have a story the special effects are crapy specially in the beginning of the movie when the car falls off. Reply mm says August 28 2015 at 646 am i hated this movie. hated the characters in the movie. I was hoping for a twist at the end where they all die Watched it for dwane johnson. He was alright the rest of the cast had no personality. I also expected this movie to be about his character saving peoples lives he was too busy saving his own gang. Also the two ladies were self absorbed as fuck bitching about that guy who ran away when everyone else were dying outside. I felt that i ended up rooting for the guy instead. And whats the point of the lady leaving him the nasty message when he didnt even receive it? Story was really predictable too. they should have killed that lady in the end. It would at least have been satisfying. Kill her instead of the asian guy and the old couple. I dont understand the hate for 2012 i enjoyed it. Reply Gunther Wilderman says August 26 2015 at 822 am This film ends the genre started in the mid 70s by Irwin Allen with ""Earthquake"" complete with ""Sensurround"" big boom boxes strategically placed around the theater to rumble audiences with low frequency noise. Speaking of noise so is this soundtrack. Its the same as everything else. Marching computerized drumbeats and big brass sounds as in Capt. America every crime TV show TV ads. Is that all there is this same predictable noise that says absolutely nothing? For this alone I give the rather startling CGI fest as minus infinity -- oh and all the emotional sap between actors supposed to tug at heartstrings. It fails and looks contrived. Reply Warlord (truthfulwarlord) says July 25 2015 at 712 pm OMG i laughed so much thanks for a great review excellent great writing sorry people i loved it Reply Alex Greys says June 29 2015 at 241 pm I think that this over-view of the concept of the movie San Andreas is wrong. Firstly okay this film is not as realistic as some but it is not supposed to be. Films that are realistic are normally based on a true story where as San Andreas was made up purely from a story. Secondly it teaches young and old people that you can do everything when you put your mind to it and get people to help you out. Finally it altogether is just a brilliant film and is a definite must-see Reply Phil says November 4 2015 at 1014 pm oh my god Reply Sarah Goodwich says June 15 2015 at 235 am I checked out this movie despite cringing at the thought of Dwayne Johnsons egregious over-acting on screen being worse than in the ring (if possible) only to have my fears confirmed in the first minute where a blond bimbo is an obviously-distracted driver who goes on a one-minute thrill-ride over a cliff... and somehow survives (I guess because ITS A SUBURU)-- all as a set-up for the introduction the crew of a rescue-helicopter thats not only being sent to assist the mishap but somehow finds time to schedule a lenghty exposition-scene/interview to go along for the ride.... and that was all as a build-up for Dwayne Johson to be some sort of serious ""hero."" Thats when I stopped watching since I just got the plot- i.e. there should be a law against wrestlers acting in movies. ""Can you smell what the Rock is cookin"" Yep hes got some bad gas- which explains his one facial expression.

Way to over the top And I have never known a firefighter to not have a glass breaker on their belt or in their pocket (I am a retired paramedic I still carry one) so for him to not have a glass breaker when his daughter was drowning... really???? I wasted my money... Reply Human Cobras says May 31 2015 at 737 am Awful film. Just awful. Dwayne Johnson is an awful actor. Probably one of the worst ever. Pass on it. Youll save yourself.

Debi says June 5 2015 at 1027 pm We also loved it This wasnt suppose to be a reality movie. Its for entertainment only It was action packed and the special effects were incredible Thats why we go Nicely done Now on to Jurrasic World ) Reply Debi says June 5 2015 at 1037 pm Oh I forgot to mention Its in 3D  Cant get any better than that dan castor says May 29 2015 at 738 am Same disaster movie plot; Estranged father must go into ground zero of disaster zone and rescue family.

Ill wait for the Blu-ray. Reply Brad King says May 28 2015 at 527 pm They should have never made the movie because earthquakes are a thing of the past in California. Remember Proposition 69 (formally titled ""Never ever any Earthquakes in California and Enforcement Act of 2011) the California law passed by direct voter initiative in 2010 by a 98%-2% vote. In the words of Governor Brown "" This law will prevent and hold mother nature accountable for any earthquakes in California"" and "".....we will be the envy of the rest of the world as all good things start in the great state of California"" Reply Warlord (truthfulwarlord) says July 25 2015 at 717 pm haha good one Watch free says May 28 2015 at 1209 am ok Reply Eyeorr says May 27 2015 at 452 pm Sorry you do need a map to get to Coit Tower. Though you can see it the staircase is nealy impossible to find unless you know that that particular staircase is the one that will take you to the Tower.

Thats enough to terrify anyone No SFX needed. Reply Eddy Robinson says May 27 2015 at 1155 am I want to watch the zany screwball comedy that this highly entertaining review suggests is possible. Reply Mantle Head says May 27 2015 at 1144 am Sounds great... and there will be a big quake; too bad about Kylie Minogue but dont forget she did start out as an actor (as did her sister in Neighbors one of the biggest soaps of all time) before she became a pop-tart. Sadly has never been the same since she had cancer but who ever is... SF is pushing it with all the development going on up there... theyre building on what at one time was a seabed. Its going to be ugly when it goes down... Reply WizKid says May 27 2015 at 1128 am Methinks Julienne is Dwayne Johnsons PR rep trying to disguise as a troll. Why else would anyone come on this blog to fight so hard to defend a negative critique of this movie? Reply Julienne says May 27 2015 at 1102 am You know what bad reviews by critics mean? Its going to be a smash hit financially. Most critics are stupid peeps that never achieved their own goals so they bash others for a living. Twitter has over a hundred million critics on their site that makes movie critics obsolete. Reply Sarah Goodwich says June 15 2015 at 304 am Thats like saying youd only bash a Ford Pinto because you cant build a car.. i.e. stupid. A sign of a bad film is where the director expects the audience to like the ""hero"" just because hes stuck in their face for the entire film showing off how great he is. Hint WRONG That only works in wrestling. Film requires to an actor to WIN the audience over- and here Andrews had no business comparing Johnson (well-named since hes such a ____) to Stallone who won audiences by being sympathetic and vulnerable in his original roles... the only resemblance is that they both playes a fictional character named ""Rocky...."" but Johnson is more like Bullwinkle. Reply Moon says May 27 2015 at 1116 am like you are doing? ahhaha such a daft comment but your lack of knowledge of critics work made me laugh...seriously. By the way what are you doing on Variety apart from trolling of course ;-) if you dont respect film critics? Reply Marquiz says May 27 2015 at 1037 am Ive seen enough disaster movies to last a lifetime. Ill wait for this when it comes out on dvd and then give my review. Reply Julienne says May 27 2015 at 1103 am Okay. So you have a BIG Screen to see the SFX? Reply Mantle Head says May 27 2015 at 1153 am All do respect but I go to movies for a story; a film about an earthquake is not a story its the inciting incident that sets the story in motion. Will I go to see this movie..? I dont know if I can sneak in after a film with an actual story perhaps... like I did with Furious 7 which I view as one of the worst films of all time no story. It was so stupid but it made zillions but its the worst film of all time and it got good reviews. I think to do with Paul Walkers (sp?) death... Vin Diesel; yeah hes a success and has muscles but the man is so stupid (hes a finger painter) with his dumbass line ...Duh me no friends... me family... It was like watching an ape choke on a banana skin. Marquiz says May 27 2015 at 1123 am Well if Im willing to wait for the dvd then I guess that means I dont care about the SFX. commonsense says May 27 2015 at 853 am So the protagonist uses a public asset (helicopter) to selfishly rescue his own family instead of doing his job. Yeah thats CA culture. Reply Sarah Goodwich says June 15 2015 at 311 am Didnt you read the review ONLY THE MAIN CHARACTERS MATTER Thats the tone of the entire movie i.e. ego-driven as were somehow only supposed to care about these five or six people just because they were shoved in our face from the beginning of the movie with corny one-liners and Johnsons stone-faced comical implication that hes their ""boss."" Yep- they are the NATION- of DOMINATION Too bad movies dont work that way- he was better when he was being hung upside-down raped by monkeys. Reply Julienne says May 27 2015 at 1104 am Or....it could be just a movie? Yeah thats the ticket. Reply Sarah Goodwich says June 15 2015 at 314 am a SELF-INDULGENT movie. Carlo says May 27 2015 at 851 am Oh great another review from a sour grapes reviewer. He is one of those idiots that feels he has to destroy you to make himself look better. Thats why I dont like most reviewers; they are only out to make themselves look clever which they fail at most of the time. And besides its their opinion not fact and they are wrong most of the time. About the only intelligent reviewer I know is Leonard Maltin. Most these so-called critics have never even been on a set and have no idea what it takes to make a movie. They couldnt find a decent job so they have to bad mouth people who actually work for a living. If you dont like these kind of movies dont go. If enough people stopped going they will stop making them. Reply Moon says May 27 2015 at 1114 am The story that film critics are only good at snobbishly bad-mouth filmmakers and that the reason they do this job is because deep down are frustrated because they were unable to actually make films is an old one. It is you that doesnt understand the role of critics in cinema and in other fields. Every critic writes about cinema for different reasons and purpose. I like to do it as a hobby and never in my life I have desired to be a filmmaker. It is the passion and knowledge for the subject that motivates them. In simple terms think about critics as people that are debating (do you allow that?) and commenting about a film with the difference that they KNOW what they are talking about and have a broad KNOWLEDGE of the subject (unlike most people that comment and share their opinions on different things without knowing anything about it). Just find one that you agree with or respect or like the way he/she approaches the film dont read other critics reviews. Reply Sarah Goodwich says June 15 2015 at 330 am "" Being opinionated and fancying yourself smart is not the same thing as actually being smart and knowledgeable."" God knows youre living proof of that. Moon says May 28 2015 at 154 pm Richard I am sorry to say this and I am simply basing it on your comment but you do not seem to know much about the value of archival articles (in literature art cinema etc) nor about the tradition and value behind criticism (literary criticism criticism of cinema and so an). Secondly I am not saying that the tastes of critics are the only right one but the way someone looks at a piece of work (again a book a film an art work..) is different if such person has experienced a variety of this kind of work and more so if he/she has done it for a long time because they place that particular piece of work not only evaluating it on an aesthetic point of you but they are also placing it within an historical context. That is what we call knowledge. The internet is great because it opens up the opportunity to everyone to comment on a number of topics but that does not make criticism from people that have studied and seen films for a long time. The fact that there are some critics whose opinion or ways of looking at cinema do not match with yours is irrelevant. What will pass are the ideas and analysis that people that have proven to know what the heck they are talking about and that includes among the others critics bloggers amateurs reviewers etc NOT everyone that any Tom Dick and Harry writes on the internet. Think about it we do the same for political commenters but somehow many people get upset only towards film critics. Go figure. One last thing thank God for critics that like (or are forced because of their job) to go watch lots of different films otherwise all the small ones that dont have the funds for a strong marketing campaign would fall under the radar unless a critic vouches for it. richard says May 27 2015 at 1256 pm Knowledge? What knowledge is exactly that? Being opinionated and fancying yourself smart is not the same thing as actually being smart and knowledgeable. Usually quite the opposite. A critic is somebody who expresses an opinion in a public forum. it used to be in the media but now the web has blurred the line of what is a public forum and yes almost everybody is a critic since anybody can make their opinion public. Critics have all the right in the world to express their opinions and if somebody is willing to pay attention to them because theyre unable to think for themselves that is their business. But do not delude yourself into thinking you have some kind of special superior knowledge or ability just because you talk about what other people do. And yes many critics are failures and snobs who try to conceal their lack of accomplishment behind their pretension and condescending attitude toward ""the masses"" who need to be ""guided"" by this few select individuals who ""know"". Find something better to do with your life. It is quite sad to be somebody who just opines and does not contribute to society more than hot air. sammyglick says May 27 2015 at 1004 am What? Did you write the screenplay for this sure to be AWFUL summer movie? How can this be a sour grapes review or did you seriously think San Andreas would be an early Oscar contender? Reply calibabe712 says May 27 2015 at 702 am There are three things that I want when I go to see a movie. The first is to have action. I dont do chick flicks or any of that garbage. Secondly I want to have a reasonable story line that I can follow without having to do some type of retrospective insight to figure out what the movie is about. Just tell me a story and go from there. Third and finally I want to be entertained for the 90 to 120 minutes that I am sitting by backside in a movie theater seat. If I am going to a documentary then I expect accuracy. Otherwise Im not looking absolutely every scene to be accurate down to the building paint. I dont need overarching themes. I just want action an easy story line and some entertainment. I liked Twister so I will probably like this as well. Reply Frederick Louis Richardson says May 27 2015 at 953 am When the reviewer deride an earthquake as not being ""fun""...neither is the notion of shooting and killing people but that hasnt stopped movie makers from showing just that. Most diaster flicks are disasters so you watch for escapism -- like watching people getting killed. Good or bad its hard work making a film and at the end of the day its only a movie. Until violence is no longer fun...then it is. Reply J.E. Vizzusi says May 27 2015 at 419 am ""Its unbelievable that the name Mario Puzo for scribing ""Earthquake"" (1974) is forgotten or the Epic Film ""San Francisco"" that had Clark Gable ducking under tables. How many times can Hollywood destroy itself should be the question here? Or another question should be ""Who will fall into the hole first? Disaster Pics on the most part have become Disaster Pics at the B.O. Reply OodlesOfDoodles says May 27 2015 at 230 am I wonder how it compares to ""10.0 Earthquake"" (2014) made for a fraction of the budget I believe it was mentioned in another Variety article a while ago starring Henry Ian Cusick and Jeffrey Jones. Reply Shake Rattle and Roll says May 27 2015 at 855 am Yeah made for a fraction of the budget...and it looked it. Reply OodlesOfDoodles says May 27 2015 at 939 am Well thats a shocker. Im talking about fun-factor duh. charlesamiller says May 27 2015 at 213 am I knew that ""San Andreas"" was going to suck a hyenas ass as soon as I saw that Dwayne Johnson was the star. Pardon but Dwayne Johnson doesnt star in ""good"" films. Reply RobA1963 says May 27 2015 at 731 am Taste is relative. Ive liked him in quite a few movies. If I leave the theater feeling better than I did when I walked in then thats a good movie to me. Im not always looking for Daniel Day-Lewis and Meryl Streep. Reply Sarah Goodwich says June 15 2015 at 321 am Yes taste is relative if you dont have any then you hate those who do. maxwell says May 27 2015 at 152 am Do u people even have a good word for any film.. Its not like u invest hundreds and millions for making a film but just sit down and criticise. Reply sammyglick says May 27 2015 at 1009 am Dont worry Maxwell your buddy The Rock will be okay if his latest movie is a turkey. He can use his millions to cry himself to sleep Reply Sarah Goodwich says June 15 2015 at 327 am ""The Rock will be okay if his latest movie is a turkey. He can use his millions to cry himself to sleep"" Along with Hulk Hogan after HIS many bad films. Who ever told wrestlers they can act? It takes more to have talent than a steroid-inflated ego (and face/body); Arnold and Stallone know HOW to play to a film-audience not a wrestling-arena. charlesamiller says May 27 2015 at 207 am Maxwell WHY do investors sink hundreds of millions of dollars into Hollywood films? They dont do it for warm feelings and compliments okay? They do it for a significant monetary return on their investment -- and that monetary return comes from US the viewers. The viewers more than anyone have the ultimate right to criticize bad films. Reply Sarah Goodwich says June 15 2015 at 322 am Which is why producers and actors are pimps and whores. Andy says May 27 2015 at 1244 am Kylie Minogue famously played another character Astrid Peth who also fell to her death (heroically) in the 2007 Dr. Who Xmas special ""Voyage of the Damned"" Reply Josh says May 27 2015 at 208 am If theres ever a ""Jack amp; Jill Went Up The Hill"" movie they should cast her. Although to be fair her scene in Holly Motors (which is more of a segment than a scene) was far more significant that it seems to be in this film.

While the new film doesnt quite reach the level of the 1970s Irwin Allen disasters to which it aspires it does give you an idea of what Allen might have wrought if hed had a 21st century CGI paintbox at his disposal. The films characters mostly fall into tropes that disaster fans will find familiar Ray Gaines (Dwayne Johnson) a helicopter pilot with the Los Angeles Fire Departments Search and Rescue team is your basic Charlton Heston alpha-male-in-charge when disaster strikes while Paul Giamatti plays Dr. Lawrence Hayes allowing him to be the actor whos too good for this kind of film saddled with pages of science-heavy exposition. (""Rhubarb rhubarb tectonic plates."") See Video Dwayne Johnson Watches California Crumble in New San Andreas Trailer (Video) Rays also got a bit of the ""Taken"" about him since hes got a nubile-but-resourceful teen daughter (Blake played by Alexandra Daddario) and an estranged wife (Carla Gugino as Emma) with a rich and untrustworthy new boyfriend (Ioan Gruffudd). (In an act of both foreshadowing and hubris the latter is currently building San Franciscos tallest skyscraper.) Throw in British tourist Ben (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) as a love interest for Blake and Bens younger brother Ollie (Art Parkinson ""Game of Thrones"") to channel Eric Sheas precocious know-it-all from ""The Poseidon Adventure"" and youve got yourself some human drama once the titular fault line starts shifting and L.A. and San Francisco start collapsing. Thats the idea anyway if theres a ""San Andreas"" fault its that director Brad Peyton (""Journey 2 The Mysterious Island"") and screenwriter Carlton Cuse (""Lost"") present the effects of a massive global disaster on a mere handful of characters who have names and significant dialogue. Were not supposed to notice that Ray whos supposed to be helping victims of the collapsed Hoover Dam ignores his orders and commandeers a helicopter for the sole purpose of rescuing Emma and Blake. Also Read Dwayne The Rock Johnson Breaks Guinness World Record at San Andreas Premiere (Video) Thankfully the action set pieces are exciting enough and come at such a successive clip -- ""Oh s-t"" may be the films most repeated line of dialogue -- that its only afterward that you have the chance to pause and ask questions about the plot. There are big loud entertainments like ""Mad Max Fury Road"" that I find myself enjoying even with my critical-thinking cap on and then there are movies like ""San Andreas"" that somehow go straight to my lizard brain; this movies dumb and its portrayal of urban devastation borders on the pornographic but Id be lying if I said I wasnt entertained. Johnson plays most of the film in his usual stoic tough-guy style but he does lighten up a bit when he and Gugino reminisce about their characters daughter who died a subplot which mainly exists to underscore why theyre so hell-bent on rescuing their remaining one. Daddario and Johnstone-Burt have sweet chemistry between them and its fun to imagine what unscripted subtext Giamatti decided to play just to keep himself interested in a character whose main task is to give dire warnings to a TV interviewer (Archie Panjabi).

Macys The Layover (Exclusive) The real star here is of course the earthquake and while 3-D IMAX will no doubt accentuate its virtues its a pity that the distributor didnt attempt to bring back Sensurround for the occasion.
