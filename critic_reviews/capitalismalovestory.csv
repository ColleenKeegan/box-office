Toward the end of Capitalism A Love Story his latest documentary polemic about the iniquities of contemporary American culture he strides through Lower Manhattans Financial District enclosing the headquarters of various banks and financial institutions within yards and yards of black-and-yellow police tape marked Crime Scene - Do Not Cross. Its as satisfying an emblem of the rottenness at the heart of the system as you could hope for. Its also one of several neat touches in a picture that adheres to Moore form a thesis to which many liberals would be instinctively favourable (in this case that untrammelled capitalism is socially harmful) is illustrated with engaging and impactful stunts (turning up at the headquarters  of Goldman Sachs in an armoured van to ask for the bail-out money back) moving personal testimony (footage of victims of mortgage foreclosures and lay-offs) and an argument that wobbles between locally convincing detail dubious extrapolation and preposterously unfounded assertion.Capitalism is at its strongest when considered in its domestic context. Die-hard Economist readers aside few Europeans subscribe to the market-capitalist purism that is perceived in many parts of the US including some of the poorest as not just an economic good but a moral and patriotic duty. Moore does a good rhetorical job of questioning the compatibility of capitalism with democracy and Christianity - one priest calls the system a radical evil - in a way that is not controversial here but will shock some Americans. Theres a persuasive if simplified momentum to his potted history of post-war US economics that moves from the prosperity of the 50s through the growing inequality of the 80s to the current catastrophe illustrated with archive material that ranges from the telling (Reagans numerous spokesmodel gigs) to sub-Adam Curtis glibness. Moores own family home movies and the history of his home town of Flint Michigan are put to nice use too. And he presents some outrageous contemporary instances of capitalism gone wild such as judges locking kids up in exchange for bungs from private borstals and companies taking out profiteering life insurance - actually called dead peasant policies - on their staff.But when it comes to what should be the smoking gun - the subprime meltdown and the financial crisis and global slump it catalysed - Capitalism fires blanks. Moore offers no cohesive argument about how the mortgage crisis happened why the ramifications were so grave and certainly not why as he alleges the US government bail-out amounted to a financial coup detat. The thesis that rapacious capitalism has horrific social consequences is credible and well illustrated if hardly eye-opening to European viewers (or frankly to Moores likely audience at home); the suggestions that that same capitalism is undemocratic and currently vulnerable to more equitable alternatives require stronger arguments than Moore can rally here.

Paul Thomas Anderson had a bash and came up with the grimly salutary There Will Be Blood but love him or be irritated by him maverick documentary-maker Michael Moore has the genius to cut together a cohesive if wildly imaginative grab-bag of facts from ancient Rome to Bernie Madoff that makes sense -- show me an economist or politician who can do that in less than two hoursMoore is always visually playful and subversive and even when dealing with such serious and depressing topics entertaining; but hes also game enough to examine Americas mythology of prosperity anyone-can-make-it-and-youre-a-loser-if-you-dont (which must be why they are all pigging out on comfort food) framing the discussion in a historical context interwoven with the contemporary woes of ordinary people labouring under the inequities of the system.He plants a major stake in the heart of big banks in particular Goldman Sachs and its influence on the American political system right to the (former) presidents desk and gives us a conspiracy theory which the far right and the left can enjoy.

Filmmaker Michael Moore talks with a police officer outside Goldman Sachs headquarters in Manhattan in a scene from the documentary Capitalism A Love Story. Photo OVERTURE FILMS Capitalism A Love Story 1 / 1 Back to Gallery First I would like to open my review of Capitalism A Love Story with a hearty ""thanks"" to the Hearst Corporation for not taking out insurance on my life. After watching Michael Moores new movie I skedaddled home and checked out a Web site listing companies known to hold ""dead peasants"" policies against their employees. Apparently Hearst is not one of them. If I drop dead right now it wont make them any money. But plenty of other companies do rake in the bucks when workers die one of the more macabre revelations in Moores latest most impassioned diatribe against the rich and powerful. At this point viewers are either with him or against him so much so that anything I write here wont change anyones mind. If you hate him youll hate the movie. If you love him youll love the movie. But no matter where you stand theres no denying Capitalisms flat-out polemic wizardry. Itll frizz your hair and break your heart. What Moore does -- feature-length partisan invectives dressed up with comically apt archival footage -- he does better than anyone. Call them documentaries but I consider them essays one-sided hyperbolic heatedly persuasive works that broadcast a single viewpoint for a single cause. The viewpoint is his. The cause is a radical democratization of the American economic system -- not socialism exactly but a kind of populist financial suffrage that elevates the little guy and minimizes greed. Its safe to say he isnt in love with capitalism. Rather than focus on just one issue Moore cherry-picks from an assortment of topics the low pay of airline pilots; the decimation of unions under the Reagan era; the privatization of public functions; the widening gap between the richest and the rest; the financial collapse of late 2008; the foreclosure epidemic and the families who suffered; the Treasury Department which was seemingly joined at the hip with Goldman Sachs; and that 700 billion government bailout. Moore illustrates the last point by backing an armored truck up to various corporate headquarters (Goldman Morgan Stanley etc.) and demanding reimbursement of taxpayer moolah. He also wraps crime-scene tape around the New York Stock Exchange. These stunts like most of Moores guerilla tactics are nothing new. Neither is his use of parody newsreels and riffing cultural references -- or the wry apocalyptic edge to his narration. Hes always funny always gloomy and always personal. Yet Capitalism A Love Story has an evangelical fervor that may surprise partisans on both ends of the spectrum. Sure he takes the usual potshots at the usual targets (George W. Bush tell me youre stunned) and yes he gets distracted by Obamaphilia but hes driven less by his liberal politics than his Catholic faith. Interviewing bishops and priests who dispute the morality of free enterprise Moore gripes about the moneyed who speak of Wall Street in sacred terms. He even messes with clips from Franco Zeffirellis Jesus of Nazareth so that Jesus badly dubbed now instructs his followers to ""go forth and maximize profits."" He tells the sick ""Im sorry I cannot heal your pre-existing condition."" Smart-alecky and simplistic? Yeah.

Liam Lacey From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Oct. 01 2009 233PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 318PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Capitalism A Love Story Directed by Michael Moore Classification PG Michael Moore has described his latest documentary Capitalism A Love Story as a summation of everything he has been working on for the past 20 years since his breakthrough with Roger amp; Me . Theres some truth in this inasmuch as Moore replays some of his familiar strategies from empathetic portraits of working Americans who feel betrayed by the system to humorous animation to now iconic scenes of the filmmaker in baseball cap and windbreaker scolding CEOs with a bullhorn or arguing with security guards. As a statement on capitalism or anything else Capitalism A Love Story is often embarrassingly simplistic self-contradictory. The title might better be Here There and Everywhere as Moore skips about from case histories to stunts to personal stories to a potted economic history of the postwar years and even a bewildering cameo from actor Wallace Shawn to explain free enterprise to us. Once again Moore documents his familys background in Flint Mich. and the collapse of the auto industry. He also introduces us to a series of individuals who have suffered outrages perpetrated by corporations. Finally he calls for a popular revolution against the Wall Street bailout which he calls a ""financial coup detat ."" Though presumably a fan of more rather than less government involvement in the economy Moore sees the bailout as another example of the rich screwing the poor and rather unexpectedly ends up sounding like the anti-government zealots from the right. Similarly he mocks capitalists who invoke God in the same sentence as ""profit motive."" In a clever interlude he dubs a Bible epic so that Jesus utters free-market platitudes and declines to heal a cripple because of his ""pre-existing condition."" Instead he wants to claim Jesus for his side. Abetted by the support of a couple of Catholic priests and a bishop Moore says unequivocally that ""capitalism is evil"" and should be eradicated. But does he mean it? As a filmmaker creating a product for a marketplace supported by profit-seeking investors he obviously has some comfort level with capitalism in the sense of doing business. Moore seems to support a kind of New Deal society (Franklin Delano Roosevelt is evoked near the films conclusion) where health care accommodation and the right to work are ensured by the state. He shows examples of employee-run co-co-operatives but holds back from endorsing that model as a universal alternative to private ownership. In fact he waxes nostalgic about the good old days of (pre-Ronald Reagan) capitalism. The ""love story"" of the title refers to his own comfortable upbringing when his father worked for a company that supplied General Motors. Capitalism it seems isnt intrinsically evil; its just evil when it fails you. Moore is more persuasive when dealing with specific cases than political generalities. His muckraking talents are still strong and the centre part of the movie could easily be packaged into an investigative television series about the morally repugnant ways corporations make money. Wal-Mart and other companies collect life insurance on their workers in what are called ""dead-peasant"" policies. Airlines cutting costs to the bone keep pilots pensions and their salaries so low some even collect food stamps. Citigroup drew up a memo for its elite investors advocating a world ""plutonomy"" of the rich threatened only by pesky democracy. A crooked judge in Pennsylvania took kickbacks from a private prison company for illegally parking juveniles in jail. These things are shameful but what do they tell us about economics? Through inference we can guess that the capitalism Moore is angry about is capitalism gone berserk as the free-market theories of Milton Friedman and others became enshrined into the Reaganite neo-con ideology of deregulation anti-unionism and tax-cutting. Like pure socialism free-market capitalism seems like one of those single unifying ideas that have no place in the real world. In the end the best the weary-sounding Moore can suggest is that capitalism needs to be replaced by ""democracy"" which amounts to exchanging one slippery term for another. Admitting that hes grown tired of his own theatrics Moore urges the audience to ""join him"" in his cause. Well sure Captain Mike as soon as we can figure out what exactly thats supposed to be.

I want Moore to make movies that figure out ways to get those who hate him or dont trust him to think twice about what hes going on about whether its the Bush war in Iraq (""Fahrenheit 9/11"") or the health care morass (""Sicko""). Moore on the other hand isnt concerned with persuading his opponents of anything beyond their own opposition to Michael Moore. The American rights favorite two-word axis of evil will never make a sober meticulous documentary such as ""No End in Sight"" which no one -- no one -- who supported Americas war in Iraq could seriously question. Rather the progressive megaphone from Flint Mich. exploits many of the same tactics used by paranoia-monger and white-culture activist Glenn Beck a marketable blend of talking points scare tactics and rhetoric millions can agree with while millions more wonder how our borders will remain safe with him around. Moores latest and broadest effort to date is ""Capitalism A Love Story."" At its best this uneven work represents Moore at the peak of his argumentative skills. Roughly a third of its anecdotal and illustrative footage hinges on precise telling details strong enough to support Moores wider indictments of the Western worlds preferred way to make a buck and treat its citizenry. When for example the film lays out the concept of ""dead peasant"" insurance policies by which some employers reap millions from the premature demise of their workers you feel the impact of both the content and the presentation. Elsewhere in ""Capitalism"" Moore nails a remarkable example of privatization run amok chronicling the story of a Pennsylvania juvenile detention center whose success relied on force-feeding the institution with as many kids as a local judge could sentence and get away with it. Moores film -- a bookend in some respects to his 1989 breakthrough the first-person provocation ""Roger amp; Me"" -- takes those vignettes throws in a harried third-act explanation of last falls federal bailout and culminates with a conclusion that American capitalism has become ""evil"" and must be replaced with ... something else. Now you can agree with this or not. You can agree with Moores assertion that last years banking bailout was an inside job patched together by Wall Street insiders working in Washington or not. (Actually Im not sure you can argue that one.) You can buy Moores trademark singsong-y voice-overs (""the only thing we didnt know was when the revolt would begin"") or not. Or you can buy some of it a lot of it up to a point. I confess Ive grown weary of Moores more blatant methods. Broke tear-stained families sitting at a kitchen table in a house theyre about to lose to a bank arent best served by the same old pathos-dispensing musical score. An introduction setting up parallels between the fall of ancient Rome and the fall of Bush II settles for easy laughs. And while its amusing to watch Moore on camera plaster the entrance to the New York Stock Exchange with crime-scene tape when Moore goes through his customary security-guard harassment in another segment its hard not to think Here we go again. Moore thinks that too At one point he reminds us hes been trying to interview sequestered members of Americas imperial ""plutonomy"" (the word comes from one of the films best bits relating to an internal Citibank report on the ruling class and how the financial world can cater to it) for ""like 20 years."" On the other hand When Moore takes his camera inside the Chicago factory Republic Windows and Doors for a striking workers sit-in you feel like youre really watching something. I admired ""Sicko"" Moores previous film because Moore toned down the screechy sarcasm of ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" (a paradoxical monster hit -- the anti-Bush polemics didnt prevent Bush from being re-elected). Only the dubious Cuba footage in ""Sicko"" undermined Moores basic thesis in that film. ""Capitalism"" by contrast tackles everything under the sun about 40 documentaries worth of economic rancor and outrage. And half the time Moore himself loses the thread of his argument. On the other other hand It is the right time to be dealing with these questions. Who else has Moores platform his devotion to the vanishing middle class? Among American filmmakers he is among the most necessary mixed blessings we have. MPAA rating R (for some language)Running time 206Featuring Michael MooreAn Overture Films release.

Thats Moores MO and the combination is all too rare no matter the political perspective."" Living luxuriously and mkaing millions off the exact same things youre criticizing is ""taking a stand and backing it up?"" Im not just talking about how Moore profits from selling his movies in a capitalist society here Im talking about him doing that while owning stock in Tyco WorldCom and Halliburton. That is not ""taking a stand and backing it up."" Taking a stand and backing it up is what people like Dennis Kucinich or Ron Paul do everyday in Washington while their colleagues laugh at them and convince all Michael Moores viewers to instead vote for some flashy corporate crook like Bush or Obama. Some of you need to not wait for Michael Moore to make another movie ""What to Do About It."" In fact you shouldnt have sat around and waited for him to make this one to get upset. This financial collapse was predicted years ago and anyone who wasnt in a stupor fawning over Obama or Sarah Palin in 2007 could have seen it coming to a head. If you want to know ""what to do about it"" Ill tell you Stop watching political hacks and propagandists like Michael Moore and Sean Hannity and go seek out information for yourself on the internet and in books. Quit waiting to have some sensationalist message preached to you and check to see who your favorite candidates biggest campaign contributors are before you vote for them. Posted by J707 | October 23 2009 at 0512 PM The fall-of-Rome sequence in Moores film is not about the fall of Bush II; its about the fall of a once-great society through corruption. Also Moore may not have prevented Bush from being re-""elected"" but he may have helped prevent a war against Iran. Posted by Philip Callas | October 20 2009 at 0454 PM Your comments about the need for Moore to try to talk to those who hate him or dont trust him shows a fantastic disregard for todays political discourse and attitudes and the pathetic state of much of our public affairs reporting. See his opponents are not interested in the truth of his criticisms they only want to demonize and marginalize. Notice how he is always attacked on his political orientation without grappling with him on the facts of themes he portrays. That is how the radical right attacks any criticism or critic. If you want a fast and pretty easy update on todays radical right and their approach try ""The Wrecking Crew"" by Thomas Frank. As to the assumption that somehow his approach of focusing on the catastrophic impacts of policies that crush families is getting old- well if you feel that way it says more about you than him. You should try visitng some of these families after you read about whats really happened at the level of finance bankers bailouts and socialism for the financial industry. Then you might have more useful commentary. Posted by Tom Foss | October 17 2009 at 0700 PM Even my most conservative friends are thinking twice even when they are angry with this film. Instead of complaining how about we all get out and start helping Micheal Moore educate people in our own ways? After all the left and the right are not the issue any more are they? Isnt ignorance and irresponsibility what we the people suffer most from? Michael Moore is an entertainer and he uses his methods. How about we start acting like citizens in a democracy too? How about we educate ourselves and bring our voices to the table? We have exactly the government and the economic system we deserve right now. Michael has been going it alone for a long time where have we all been? It is our turn quit shooting the messenger. Posted by Charlotte Hutt | October 17 2009 at 1033 AM Moores Love Story sets the stage for his best film ever What to Do About It. Rather than leave theaters merely fuming at injustice we need movies that dramatize our power and success. There are many such stories to tell. Posted by Paul Glover | October 13 2009 at 0257 PM So you want Moore to get the haters to like him? Do you think before you write? I think you miss the point of his movies. He is an advocate who takes a stand and promotes his point of view. One documentary does not change the world. Id love to see your documentary that would get everyone to think about the message. Its not going to happen. That kind of movie would be so compromised that it would not only be pointless it would be boring. (Sleeper of the year) Michael Moore entertains. informs. and takes a stand. George W. Bush gave us eight years of bad leadership and comedy. Moore helps us laugh at those wasted years. He has a powerful message that wont appeal to everyone. Posted by Louise | October 08 2009 at 0634 PM This last commnet was unfair. Phillips was testing Moore on his ability to make the arguments no matter what they are. Moores indictment of the bailouts are something people on the left and right could both support but he bungled it in the movie with cheap stunts and hackneyed arguments. The scenes with people losing houses could be seen on MSNBC three nights a week. You may not like Phillips or most other critics opinions of Moores movie but it is pretty obvious to most honest ctitics on the right the left or from Mars. This was an average Moore effort. Better than Canadian Bacon but not up there with his best or even Farenheit 9/11. 2 1/2 stars sounds about right. Posted by Craig | October 04 2009 at 0210 AM Yo -- what in the movie does Moore claim that is implausible and not backed up??? You offer example after example of Moore making his case but then make the claim that he uses ""Beck-like"" talking points and rhetoric. What specifically did he get wrong or what specifically was unconvincing? Minus what the other commentator rightly calls ""chickenbleep attempts to be balanced"" this is a very pro-Moore review. Why did you feel like you had to hedge????? Posted by Egypt Steve | October 03 2009 at 0539 PM ""Our relationship""? Dont flatter yourself. Youre but a gutless critic whose lifes contributions amount to little and who hopes wishfully that ""those who hate him or dont trust him"" - or those who do - might pay some attention. Your efforts to be different from all the other reviewers actually read just like the others - a chickenbleep attempt to be ""balanced"" and position yourself firmly in the middle so no one can take offense. You could have written this months ago well before the film was released. Try taking a stand sometime and backing it up. Thats Moores MO and the combination is all too rare no matter the political perspective. Posted by Robin Buntam | October 01 2009 at 0645 PM The comments to this entry are closed.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor October 2 2009 Save for later Saved Filmmaker Michael Moore talks to a police officer outside of Goldman Sachs headquarters in Manhattan in a scene from his documentary ""Capitalism A Love Story."" Overture Films/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Michael Moores new documentary ""Capitalism A Love Story"" is a sob story laced with acid tears. Early on in the film Moore offers up home movies of himself as a happy tyke in Flint Mich. His auto worker father is comfortable in his employment; his pension is guaranteed. All is right with the world. Clips from 1950s educational films featuring crew-cut stentorian narrators proudly tout the capitalist way of life. ""If this was capitalism I loved it"" says Moore in voice-over in his most mock-satiric tone.According to Moore the advent of Reaganomics blighted this paradise and led directly to todays economic meltdown. Theres a hefty I-told-you-so factor at work here as Moore not so humbly inserts footage from his 1989 ""Roger amp; Me"" documentary about the closing by General Motors of Flints auto factory. The subtext to ""Capitalism A Love Story"" is ""If youd only listened to me back then.""Moore savages the people and institutions he feels are responsible for the depredations of the market system - including the usual suspects - Wall Street the banks Hank Paulson Countrywide Financial etc. - but also among others former Goldman Sachs head and Clinton Treasury Secretary and Obama adviser Robert Rubin and Obama Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? But Moore isnt just railing against the malefactors. The capitalist system itself has got his goat. And this is where the movie collapses into an ideological mass of contradictions and inconsistencies. For starters if pre-Reagan capitalism was so rosy then how can he justifiably attack capitalism as a system? Moore is doing the same thing here that he did in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" where in order to bolster the follies of the Bush war in Iraq he first shows us children gamboling happily in the pre-invasion streets of Baghdad. Moore could easily have pointed out that pre-Reagan capitalism also had its share of potholes on the superhighway to wealth - like for starters the Great Depression. But doing so would spoil his game plan - his love story. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Movie review Capitalism A Love Story And what does Moore wealthy from his movies and books propose as an alternative to capitalism? Something called a ""democratically run economy."" This is about as amorphous as Moores attack on capitalism itself. Hes on solid ground when he lances Wall Street the banks the pols. But when he hauls in anti-capitalism examples like a for-profit juvenile detention center in Wilkes Barre Pa. where school kids are incarcerated for snarking an assistant principal on MySpace hes simply being Michael Moore.Probably because hes already gone after Bush (in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"") and the healthcare system (in ""Sicko"") Moore skimps on the dramatic effect of the costs of the Iraq war and the for-profit health industry on the US economy. But this downplaying distorts his overall indictment and gives undue weight to his contention that the system itself is the root of all evil. He sentimentalizes FDR who in a fascinating previously unseen clip is shown near the end of life calling for a ""second Bill of Rights"" guaranteeing affordable homes healthcare and ""useful"" work for all as if no president since has issued the same call.Moore is much better at indicting culprits than providing solutions. He might argue that coming up with answers is not his job that hes a grass-roots agitator. But the disconnect in ""Capitalism"" between his righteous agitations and his piddling remedies is vast. The real love story here is between Moore and his bullhorn. Grade B (Rated R for some language.)

"Capitalism A Love Story Moore takes on greed | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsOpinionCapitalism A Love Story Moore takes on greedMichael Moores new documentary is subtitled A Love Story but its actually a ""Dear John"" letter to a U.S. capitalist system he considers corrupt broken and downright evil.In Capitalism A Love Story Michael Moore shows us the victims and vultures of the economic meltdown.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Oct. 2 2009 Capitalism A Love Story (out of 4)A documentary on the ethics and excesses of the economic meltdown written and directed by Michael Moore.120 minutes. At major theatres. PG Michael Moores new documentary is subtitled A Love Story but its actually a ""Dear John"" letter to a U.S. capitalist system he considers corrupt broken and downright evil. He wants nothing less than a grassroots democratic revolution against the banks and their political enablers a proposition that puts him in the crosshairs of every mad dog with a microphone. How dare he attack something as fundamentally American as greed?Moore does it because hes angry frustrated and frightened about the future of his country in the wake of the recent economic meltdown that cost 700 billion (U.S.) in taxpayer bailout funds to prop up distressed banks. Hes in good company with the majority of his fellow bruised and baffled citizens who have lost countless jobs and homes while Wall Streeters were given bonuses and lifeboats. The result is a film that stands as one of Moores finest arguments. Its also one of his funniest if you accept that the jokes are all of the gritted-teeth variety. Capitalism A Love Story rediscovers the wit that was so much in evidence in Moores early films and TV exposes and also the common touch that has been missing from his anti-Bush agit-prop of the past decade. For once hes not pretending that he knows all the answers.He returns to Roger amp; Me his 1989 breakthrough expanding the focus of that film from General Motors to America as a whole. This makes Capitalism seem almost like a sequel to a zombie flick the economic devastation of Moores hometown of Flint Mich. documented in Roger amp; Me has spread like a mutant virus to take down cities and towns across the U.S.We meet the victims and the vultures of a new American economy that seems based more on destroying than building. Or as Moore puts it ""This is capitalism a system of taking and giving mostly taking."" The victims include guys like Randy Hacker a former Illinois railroad worker who is forced out of his defaulted home by a bank which then hires him and his family to work as cleanup crew for the new buyers. Moores camera pauses to look at Hackers fearsome collection of guns and to listen to his thinly veiled threat of armed civil uprising.Not even airline pilots are above the scorched ground of the new America. Moore talks to pilots at discount commuter airlines who earn less than 20000 annually and who are forced to sell their blood for cash or moonlight as diner wait staff. At times Moore yields to his penchant for milking emotion to the final teardrop but for the most part hes restrained and respectful.Whose fault is the crisis? Using mirthful archival footage and testimonies from everyone from Everyman actor Wallace Shawn to the Catholic archbishop of Chicago Moore paints a persuasive portrait of how post-World War II Americans were sold a bogus dream of capitalist plenty by the false prophets of Wall Street. The vultures tracked by Moore include guys like Peter Zalewski the proud head of Condo Vultures a Florida realty firm that specializes in snatching up distress sales and flipping them to ""bottom feeders"" for a quick profit. But Moore saves his biggest ammo for some of the biggest names in recent headlines including U.S. Secretary of Treasury Timothy Geithner whom President Barack Obama has entrusted with solving the economic mess that Moore alleges - on solid evidence - was caused in the first place by Geithner and his former Wall Street cronies.Moore also does a first-rate job in backgrounding and explaining the crisis and such Byzantine concepts as credit derivatives that elude even Harvard economic professors. He shows how money men exploited the deregulation craze of the past 20 years to turn Wall Street into an ""insane casino"" built on loans that were more like bets.In doing so Moore points more than one finger. His favourite nemesis George W. Bush comes in for a pounding (including a hilarious sky-is-falling animated sequence) but the firebrand from Flint also scorches Jimmy Carter Ronald Reagan Bill Clinton and even the sainted Obama himself.The only president whom Moore seems to have complete respect for is Franklin D. Roosevelt the War World II leader who sought to create a second Bill of Rights to promote families and workers.Moores mourning for FDR gives an elegiac feeling to Capitalism A Love Story as does his use of Moore family home movie footage and his repeated returns to Flint and Roger amp; Me. He predicted 20 years ago that GM could go bankrupt which it did during the course of making this movie but Moore wisely resists the impulse to crow ""I told you so"" too loudly. He dares to invoke the ""s"" word - socialism - arguing that its more humane than capitalism and couldnt possibly be any worse.Hes genuinely concerned about what has happened to his country. Hes worried that people will resort to violence rather than civic action and he challenges viewers of Capitalism A Love Story to not just leave their resolve in their crumpled popcorn containers.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint With ""Capitalism A Love Story"" Michael Moore delivers his liveliest most radical film to date. Forget the weary debate over the lack of dissenting voices and balance in his work. Moore is a provocateur and ""Capitalism"" is a Molotov cocktail thrown straight at the heart of the New York Stock Exchange. The impact is spectacular. This is no eye-glazing tutorial on debt swaps (Moore shows us a tongue-tied Harvard economist unable to explain a derivative). Instead the film gives us a rollicking review of economic outrages and a scalding critique of insatiable greed. Capitalism isnt just a flawed theory Moore argues its evil a multiplier of all that is selfish and wrong in human nature. Fingers are pointed names are named. Democrats take almost as many lumps as Republicans. We meet families evicted from homes where they have lived for decades airline pilots paid so little they qualify for food stamps spouses stunned to learn that ghoulish employers took out secret insurance policies on their loved ones and made millions when they died. How did the Crisis of 08 come about? Moore rewinds to the heady days of World War II when government expenditures boosted Americas morbid economy and the 1950s when single-worker blue-collar households lived well. Moores Good Old Days came to a screeching halt when Ronald Reagan brought in Wall Street financier Donald Regan as his first Treasury secretary. Regan was the chief spokesman for the 1981 tax cut trimming taxes for low-income families while slashing rates for the wealthy. Moore is spare with charts and graphs but they clearly detail the greatest upward redistribution of wealth in U.S. history. Government connived with big business to reduce financial regulations and let the captains of the market steer whatever course they chose. Like over a waterfall. Moore recounts last years panic in scary detail connecting the dots between ballooning mortgage rates mass defaults and the near-meltdown of global capital markets. Inevitably the big-bonus crowd used the crisis to stuff their pockets with stimulus money ""Heads we win tails we win."" CAPITALISM A LOVE STORY  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for some language. After 20 years in the movie business Moore knows that Groucho Marx trumps Karl Marx. Laughs and hope sell better than anger and Moore tempers his attacks with prankishly re-edited old movies and plenty of good cheer. One of the films heroes is polio researcher Dr. Jonas Salk who could have enriched himself by claiming patent rights to his vaccine. He gave it away for free. Saving millions from paralysis and death was reward enough. Moore once again shambles through the story like Inspector Columbo asking naive questions and building his case piece by piece. Today the nations top 1 percent of households own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent. In 2005 analysts at Citigroup coined the term ""plutonomy"" to describe Americas massive wealth inequality. Given the wealth-friendly government policies in place the report concluded the rich were guaranteed to keep getting richer. The only cloud that Citigroups researchers spied on the horizon was the chance of indignant political backlash ""One person one vote"" worried the analysts. If Moore has his way the other 99 percent of voters will make themselves heard. ""I refuse to live in a country like this"" he declares ""and Im not leaving.""

Take a walk down his Hall of ShameThere is the real estate industry represented by opportunists such as Florida broker Peter Zalewski who buys foreclosed properties way below market rate and resells them (at a profit) through his company Condo Vultures.There is the airline industry represented by regional carriers who dont pay full-time pilots a living wage. One admits on camera to depending on food stamps. Even veterans of national carriers have seen their pensions entirely eliminated as Sully Sullenberger hero-pilot of the Hudson River miracle landing testified before Congress.Then there are the corporate vultures like those companies who take out life insurance policies on their employees (unknown to said employees beneficiaries) and profit from them in death - a practice called ""dead peasant insurance.""And why Moore asks are all these Wall Street refugees from financial-services giant Goldman Sachs (such as Hank Paulson and Robert Rubin) making economic policy in Washington bailing out bankers but letting most working Americans sink or swim?In other words the average American cant win. After the bank repossesses his house the Realtor profits from its resale. And after the company takes away his pension he dies and his employers profit on his death without sharing his life-insurance payout with his survivors. Or hes downsized - as downsized investment bankers get bigger and better jobs in Washington.In passages the movie is eloquent. In sum it is scattershot. Organization is not Moores strongest suit; indignation is. Hes angry about corporate vulturism angrier that hard-working Americans (such as his father a longtime General Motors employee) are victims of union-busting management and angriest that capitalism at the millennium enriches the rich and impoverishes the poor. (That GM failed to make fuel-efficient vehicles Americans wanted to buy is a factor that Moore does not consider.)Still his indignation is often righteous. He is furious and you might be too at the two Wilkes-Barre judges who received kickbacks for sentencing juveniles to a for-profit detention center.Amid his gloomy dispatches from the workplace Moore sees some hopeful signs. Like a successful union demonstration at a Chicago factory.Of the many sound bites in Capitalism A Love Story the most eloquent is from the man who quietly and firmly observes ""People who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of what dictatorships are made.""Now class identify the quote The speaker is not Karl Marx but Franklin D.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + The scope of Michael Moores documentaries gets bigger with each movie. Twenty years ago he told the story of how General Motors undid his hometown and went on to tackle gun control the Bush administrations handling of the Iraq war and health care. Now Moore is going after the entire American economic system. But ""Capitalism A Love Story is redundant for a filmmaker whose work has always dealt with the dismaying consequences of this countrys profit motive. Isnt every Michael Moore film ultimately about capitalism? This one just has a more facetious title.This love story lands amid a crisis thats been dubbed The Great Recession and Moores talent for on-time arrivals gives the movie a lot of its kick. But the subject is so vast that what ultimately Moore intends to achieve is vague. After opening with an amusingly juxtaposed montage of clips depicting life in ancient Rome mixed with highlights of the Bush administration (them again) the movie finds a couple of nice families whose homes are being foreclosed upon. It introduces us to a gentleman who spends his days promiscuously snatching up such repossessed properties. Moore delves into a Wal-Mart life-insurance scandal in which the company profits from dead employees. He shares a city bench with a former Wall Street whiz who has an impossible if hilarious time trying to explain certain financial instruments. He visits with Marcy Kaptur a congresswoman from Ohio who has called the governments bailout of failing banks a crime perpetrated against the American people. Along the way Moore continues to whack at the Bush administration which for his purposes is like a pinata that will never stop raining candy. These encounters and others in which Moore parts the curtain on his Michigan childhood certainly stoke the movies editorial fire. But the filmmaking doesnt build into a greater whole. ""Capitalism lacks the epic human scope of ""Bowling for Columbine the rage of ""Fahrenheit 9/11 and the farce of his most underrated outing ""Sicko. This one feels diffuse even for Moore.Part of the problem may be the fault of the economy itself. Had Moore waited for real improvement - well who knows when wed see the movie. Yet a narrower political universe like gun control for instance allows Moores roving imagination to make surprising observations to exhaust the subject. Here the hugeness appears to have wiped him out.Hes also better on the road. For all the different tales of malfeasance and woe ""Capitalism feels inert. You yearn for the inspired spirit of expedition that culminated in Moores taking a boatload of ailing Americans to Cuba for free medical care in ""Sicko. This time all we get is a finale in which the director runs a roll of crime-scene tape around the Merrill Lynch building. Its a hollow bit of comedy. As hes become a star of anti-corporate discontent Moore has put Average Joes on such a high pedestal that they cant get down. He is neither journalist nor talk-show host enough to really question his constituents. But really those kinds of challenges dont suit his brand of entertainment which often relies on conjecture and extrapolation to rouse or infuriate. Moore can turn a kernel of truth into a barrel of popcorn. Thats a peculiar skill. Even as you recognize that the nuances and finer points of arguments are being shaved away the conclusion he reaches feels about right. He simply cuts a lot of corners to get there. ""Capitalism is long on terrible stories of helpless families and officials profiting from the abuse of their power. But in creating this air of unstoppable cosmic oppression Moore makes us seem more helpless than we actually are. Greed is bad. The banks need reform. And many of the haves in this country have what they have at the expense of have-nots. But in asserting this Moore has made a movie about the inarguable ravages of the free market that omits the possibility of free will.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie review Capitalism A Love Story -- 4 out of 5 stars Capitalism A Love Story Michael Moore / via Bloomberg Documentary tackles the effect of corporate dominance on the everyday lives of Americans. Directed by Michael Moore. Overture Films Sept. 23 Documentary tackles the effect of corporate dominance on the everyday lives of Americans. Directed by Michael Moore. Overture Films Sept. 23 (Michael Moore / via Bloomberg) Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic With Capitalism A Love Story Michael Moore brings it all back to Roger amp; Me (1989) the essay/documentary that started it all. That cautionary Jeremiad about the export of American jobs overseas and the export of power and money from ""We the People"" to Wall Street is the warning at the beginning and the exclamation point at the end of Capitalism. And Moore being Moore he cant quite resist a bit of ""I told you so"" in the process.""I tried to warn GM that this day was coming"" he says of the bankrupt automaker. Its too much for one movie. Prize-winning newspaper series and books have been written about ""America What Went Wrong."" The unholy alliance between Big Bankers and the Treasury Department the politics of shifting the tax burden away from the rich and screaming ""socialism"" at those who challenge it the loss of jobs and rights from individuals to corporations -- Moore tries to get at all these currents in American unease in Capitalism.Moores camera watches evictions in North Carolina Illinois and Michigan and follows a predatory ""Condo Vulture"" showing clients foreclosed properties in Miami. We see people re-occupy their foreclosed homes in South Florida and demand their promised payoff from a shuttered factory in Chicago. There is weeping over lost careers and shattered lives over the widespread practice of companies taking out secret insurance policies on their employees so that they literally profit by your death. Wal-Mart loves these ""dead peasant"" policies the movie says.Theres a lot of depressing and readily available information in this Love Story about the depths of corporate wrongdoing and the lengths the villains have gone to in re-distributing wealth and power to a handful of people at a handful of Wall Street firms.Priests decry the ""immoral"" and ""radically evil"" ethos of capitalism. Secret memos from Citibank celebrate the new American ""plutocracy"" set up for and governed by the rich.Moore pulls a few stunts -- trying to stage citizens arrests at Goldman Sachs and AIG. He rents an armored truck and demands repayment of government bailout money. He names the usual suspects as villains -- Reagan Bush but also Clinton treasury secretaries and Obamas Timothy Geithner. Moore has homeowners workers and members of Congress plead for ""fairness."" He lets a Fed who investigated the vast savings and loan scandal of the 80s condemn ""the greatest wave of white-collar crime in history.""And then Moore calls for the pitchforks. Capitalism is alternately moving and disheartening energizing and enervating. Moore fan or foe if youve been paying attention you have to admit much of this information has passed before your eyes already unless you were too busy weeping with Glenn Beck to notice.

"Capitalism A Love Story | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; capitalism-a-love-story ) Capitalism A Love Story (United States 2009) September 28 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Perhaps Michael Moore missed his calling. He could have been a preacher. And not any kind of preacher - a fire-and-brimstone Jonathan Edwards sort. His movies ooze passion and come across like two-hour sermons. He doesnt just believe in what hes saying; he wants everyone who sees his movies to feel his outrage; whether or not they agree with it is another matter altogether. Hes a propagandist and his movies are more like cinematic op-ed pieces than conventional documentaries but thats alright. No one ever said there was no room for showmanship in non-narrative filmmaking. Capitalism A Love Story is the latest chapter in the Gospel of St. Michael and its a distinct improvement over his last two movies. Fahrenheit 9/11 was a muddled ""exposA(c)"" of the Bush administrations foreign policy sins and Sicko was an oddly low-key rant about health care. Capitalism seems to be coming more from the heart. Theres a simmering anger here that hasnt been present since Moore first burst upon the cinematic world with Roger and Me. Capitalism A Love Story is vintage Moore which means that it will enthrall many and enrage an equal number of viewers - not because of the subject matter but because its Michael Moore. For better or for worse thats what happens when youre a lightning rod. Capitalism works not because (a) it is more accurate or (b) it takes fewer liberties with the facts or (c) it provides the result of deeper investigative journalism than Moores earlier films. No Capitalism succeeds because it has the capacity to fuel thought and spur argument. This is something to be seen before dinner not afterwards. One does not leave this movie benumbed and feeling as if two hours of special effects have dulled the mind. Moores goal is not to have legions of sheep parroting his words but to generate discussion. And at least on this occasion his attacks cross party lines. This isnt an all-out frontal assault against the G.O.P. Moore takes aim at Democrats as well. In fact his thesis states that the U.S. Government from the Reagan era on (including Clinton) has systematically betrayed the American public with the highest point of this betrayal coming via the TARP bailout. He places the blame for that squarely on the shoulders of George W. Bush and the Democrat leaders in the House and Senate. (Pelosi and Reid this means you) And he lambasts Chris Dodd (D - Connecticut) with charges of hypocrisy most foul. Moore is not beyond showing a little favoritism however. He implies that Barak Obama entered the White House as a reformer but the purity of his mission and message of Change was quickly defiled by the money being tossed around by the denizens of Wall Street. This charge which is never explicitly stated is not pursued. Moore appears unwilling to make a statement that could be construed as an outright condemnation of anything associated with Obama. It is not mentioned for example that Obama was a fierce backer of the bailout and touted the familiar line that it was ""distasteful but necessary"" (a position that Moore vehemently opposes). So although one can argue that Capitalism is as close to non-partisan as Moore has gotten during the course of his filmmaking career his hands-off approach to Obama opens him up to criticism. Moores thesis reduced to its essence argues that capitalism at least in its current ""greed is good"" incarnation is evil. The love of money over all else is the root of everything foul and corrupt. This brand of ""capitalism"" makes the rich richer and the poor poorer. It uses taxpayer money to bail out banks and corporations that were in peril because of their own poor management and gambling. It results in salary decreases to workers massive job cuts and pay raises to CEOs. And the government is complicit in all of this with many of the people working to regulate the markets being former employees of the companies being regulated. Even discounting Moores penchant for hyperbole Capitalism paints a damning picture and thats because theres really nothing new in the film. Moore is drawing from mostly mainstream sources ABC NBC CBS Newsweek The Wall Street Journal etc. And its pretty compelling when two Catholic priests and one Catholic bishop declare that capitalism is immoral and against the teachings of Jesus. Moores movies follow a template and this one is not substantially different although the filmmaker restrains himself from too many on-screen appearances and his grandstanding is held to a minimum. The trailer highlights scenes of Moore approaching the corporate headquarters of various recipients of TARP funds and asking for the taxpayers money back but thats a minor sideshow - shtick that plays well in a commercial but absorbs about 2% of the actual running time. He still employs shock tactics and fires off the occasional cheap shot (he takes more than one at Reagan) and the gallows humor is never far from the surface. Moore manages to mix outrage and comedy better than most stand-up comics. At the heart of it all is of course a serious message and regardless of whether you worship the director despise him or are somewhere in between its hard to disregard his central question. So while Capitalism A Love Story is unlikely to change anyones opinion of Moore as a filmmaker and rabble-rouser some of the content may result in a deeper consideration of the influence that Wall Street has over Washington D.C. This is an important movie; it paints a bleak picture of the systematic destruction of the middle class and it may be the first entry in the directors filmography to echo the concerns not only of liberals but of conservatives.

Capitalism A Love Story Fair to good Director Michael Moore. Rating R for some language. Related Moore pulls no punches No more docs? Moore mulls post-Capitalism career Instead it serves both as a screed against capitalism and a sort of Michael Moore greatest-hits movie with the filmmaker revisiting some of his old tricks. What this means is that despite a few new wrinkles (going after Democrats as well as Republicans) the film isnt going to change anyones opinion about Moore. If you love the guy and his movies theres plenty here to delight you. If you think hes not just wrong but dangerously so you wont be disappointed either. One thing that cant be argued however is the skill with which Moore does his work. ""Capitalism"" may be flawed but it is nevertheless entertaining. Which counts for a lot. Much like Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity on the other side of the aisle Moores not necessarily out to win over converts. Instead hes preaching to the choir and the more fire and brimstone he can lay on the happier his congregation will be. For Moore capitalism isnt just a bad system its an evil one so much so that he brings on a couple of Catholic priests to say that its basically immoral. (""Capitalism"" contains by far the most overt religious references of any of Moores films.) He holds it responsible for dashing the idyllic lifestyle he and others enjoyed; his father worked in Flint Mich. at a spark-plug factory a good union man who had no real debt. Enter Ronald Reagan and the go-go years on Wall Street. To Moore this was the beginning of the end the start of a period when the rich got richer at the expense of everyone else. Moore suggests that the period might end with the election of Barack Obama an event that gives Moore hope so much so that one segment of the film would probably make the president himself blush. Along the way Moore revisits ""Roger amp; Me"" in which he used a quixotic attempt to interview then-General Motors CEO Roger Smith as a vehicle to get at the disintegration of Flint his hometown. Employing some of that films tactics he tries to enter buildings that house corporations hoping to talk to their leaders. Only now hes a known quantity and security is ready for him. One wishes that someday theyd let him in and see what happens then. Though they provide the bulk of the humor ""Capitalism"" works best when Moore lays off the tricks and gimmicks. Footage shot by a North Carolina family refusing to leave their home as authorities enter to seize it is harrowing and his examination of ""dead-peasant"" insurance in which companies take out policies on employees and then reap the rewards when they die is certainly eye-opening. This is also his most personal work. Moore shows us photos and home movies of his childhood and he takes his elderly father on a tour of the ruins of the plant where he once worked. Moore ultimately turns ""Capitalism"" into a call for action saying that he cant do this by himself anymore. Perhaps. But one gets the idea that silence is one thing that doesnt suit him.

By David Denby Michael Stuhlbarg plays a Job figure in the Coens new movie.   Credit Illustration by Tom Bachtell At the conclusion of their new movie ""A Serious Man"" the Coen brothers pull off a neat little joke. The picture is devoted to the travails of an unhappy Midwestern Jewish family--a real menagerie--in the sixties and in the end titles the Coens have inserted after the names of hardworking laboratories the words ""No Jews were harmed in the making of this motion picture."" Very good; first rate in fact. But Im not sure its true. I know of at least two Jews who were harmed--Ethan and Joel Coen. ""A Serious Man"" like ""Burn After Reading"" is in their bleak black belittling mode and its hell to sit through. The movie is a deadpan farce with a schlemiel Job as a hero--Professor Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg) a physicist at a local university whose life in 1967 is falling apart. Gopniks wife (Sari Lennick) is leaving him for a sanctimonious bastard (Fred Melamed) who covers his aggressions against Larry with limp-pawed caresses and offers of ""understanding."" Larrys kids are thieving brats and his hapless sick whining brother (Richard Kind) camps on the living-room couch and refuses to look for work. Theres more much more a series of mishaps sordid betrayals and weird coincidences but Larry a sweet guy and ""a serious man""--upright a good teacher a father--wont hit back. Occasionally his eyebrows fluttering like street signs in a hurricane he stands up for himself but he wont take a shot at anyone or try to control anyone verbally or any other way. He wont even sleep with the dragon-eyed but sexy and highly available woman next door who sunbathes naked. The Coens begin mysteriously with what feels like a Yiddish folktale. Long ago in a shtetl somewhere in Eastern Europe an elderly man supposedly dead wanders into the house of a married couple. The wife is sure that hes a dybbuk--a spirit possessing a humans body--and she sticks a knife in his chest. The troubles surrounding Larry Gopnik in suburban Minnesota many generations later can only be seen as the revenge of ""Hashem""--the word that Conservative Jews in this Midwestern community use to name God. (If that Old Country dybbuk was not God himself he must have been in Gods employ.) One model for the tale is obvious acting on his wager with Satan God drives Job to despair. Yet Job risking his life questions his tormentor and Larry does not. The Coens created him that way; they explicitly celebrate ""simplicity"" and resignation. But a schlep and a weeper is a hero impossible to stay interested in. The Coens themselves grew up in a suburban area outside Minneapolis. Like Larrys pot-smoking son Danny (Aaron Wolff) they were kids in the sixties when rock and roll and drugs kicked holes in the conformist patterns of American middle-class life. They may be remembering that repressive time and its breakup--assuaging old hurts settling old scores. Bored to death as a Hebrew teacher drones on Danny transistor radio plugged into his ear listens to Grace Slick raising the roof in ""Somebody to Love"" which certainly feels like a primal memory of entrapment and liberation. That song plus dope and ""F Troop"" on TV is all that keeps Danny going. He and his family live on a featureless sun-bleached suburban street where each house is fronted by a boxy patch of grass. Its the suburban nightmare that keeps showing up in ambitious American movies as the banality of evil itself. The low ceilings the schlocky decor are meant to be of a piece with the endless family bickering and emotional blackmail--satirically enhanced signs of mediocre soul-punishing middle-class taste Jewish division. As always the Coens shape their visual scheme into mocking juxtapositions sudden startling shifts of perspective; intrusive closeups of ears and mouths; scenes that end abruptly with cuts arriving like a guillotines blade. The brilliant cinematographer Roger Deakins uses super-hard focus and solid colors and when Larry perched on his roof tries to straighten out the TV aerial he looks like a forlorn figure in a nineties hyperrealist painting. Instead of paintings meant to look like photographs the Coens give us photographs that look like paintings and theres a touch of the uncanny in the hard-edged look as if Hashem had isolated and withered Larry with his gaze. As a piece of moviemaking craft ""A Serious Man"" is fascinating; in every other way its intolerable. What happens in Minnesota has none of the warmth and expansiveness of a folktale either traditional or modern. (Isaac Bashevis Singer would have been disgusted by the heros backing away from the babe next door.) The Coens humor is distant dry and shrivelling and they make the people in ""A Serious Man"" so drably unappealing that you begin to wonder what kind of disgust the brothers are working off. Whatever indignities the Coens suffered as teens they have hardly been hampered by those memories as adults. Philip Roths collection of stories ""Goodbye Columbus"" which tore into the timidity and prohibitions of middle-class American Jewish life came out in 1959 when Ethan Coen was two and Joel five. The Coens laughter is not exactly fresh. Dozens of popular comics in the past half century have worked in the same satiric vein. Larry applies to a series of local rabbis for help and the rabbis vain of their wisdom either miss the point of his troubles or tell elaborate parables that illuminate nothing; they have no idea why Hashem is pursuing this man. And who is Hashem anyway? I suppose one might say that all filmmakers distributing rewards and punishments come close to playing God. Surely the arbitrary and ruthless Coens are the only deity in sight. Larry Gopnik may teach the uncertainty principle in his class but his own fate is sealed in advance and were not surprised when at the end the apocalypse arrives in a dark whirl. Judging from ""A Serious Man"" one can only say without blasphemy that the cinematic Hashem is a malevolent son of a bitch. Theres a good documentary kicking around at the moment that connects the arrogant behavior of bankers in New York to the loss of homes and the destruction of neighborhoods during the economic meltdown--Andrew and Leslie Cockburns ""American Casino."" Michael Moores ""Capitalism A Love Story"" is something else--not a good movie or a coherent exposition of the meltdown but an emotional attack on capitalism as a system an attempt literally to de-moralize capitalism. Moore wants to end the notion that capitalism is good--benevolent creative-destructive the Lords work or anything else positive that has ever been claimed for it. Capitalism in this rendering lays waste to everything; its a power structure that allows the rich to steal from the poor. There is much talk of ""the rich"" and their bad behavior. Some of the taunts may be justified but improbably Moore has rich people and their bought-and-paid-for agents in Congress consciously planning every turn in the economy as a series of heists (Alan Greenspans recommending home-equity loans was the beginning of a scheme it turns out to get people ""out of their houses""). If thats the case Moore might have offered some explanation of how ""the rich"" as well as millions of others lost thirty per cent or more of their equity in the stock-market collapse of 2008. Undeterred he ridicules sordid practices--for instance a privately run juvenile detention center where kids committing minor offenses are put away for months increasing profitability. He uses old films like Zeffirellis ""Jesus of Nazareth"" for sarcastic fun Jesus dubbed recommends not care for the poor but deregulating the banking industry as the way to salvation. ""Capitalism"" gathers emotional force when Moore moves close to the victims.He uses a home video shot inside a foreclosed house that squatters have refused to leave; the police approach in force and then bash through the kitchen door--a scary moment. He joins the defiant workers at Republic Windows and Doors in Chicago who also squatted and won severance pay from a company that wanted to throw them into the street. Hes outraged that working Americans could be tossed out of a job or a house and no one can argue with that anger or with his grief over the fate of his home town Flint Michigan which was the subject of his first success ""Roger and Me"" twenty years ago. Michael Moore has never recovered emotionally from the closing of the G.M. plants in Flint. Once it seems there was a paradise memorialized in home movies his father worked at the AC Spark Plug plant the family had plenty to eat and enough money to send the kids to school. In the movies most touching moment Moore accompanies his father now very old as he stares in horror at the flattened wasteland where the plant once stood. But Moore is so mesmerized by Flints tragedies that he thinks G.M. went bankrupt because it closed plants in the eighties. Modern capitalism with its torrential flow of money across borders is beyond him. By the end of the movie baffled he resorts to his old gags trying to get Henry Paulson for example on the phone to hold him accountable; wrapping Goldman Sachss New York headquarters in yellow crime-scene tape. Its a sad movie--funny yet wounded and bewildered.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review This Time Its Personal ShareThis BACKSTORY Michael Moore says that the scene where he discusses President Obamas campaign contributors is very specifically targeted. I really see an audience of one for that scene Moore told the Times. I want [Obama] to know that we know that Goldman was his single largest contributor and what he does with that is his choicehe can choose to side with them or with us. Moore did not go on to add (as the conservative commentator Ira Stoll noted last week) that the Weinstein Company Moores executive producer was likewise funded with a billion dollars raised by Goldman Sachs. Say what you will about Michael Moore hes a riotously successful left-wing carnival barker in a culture that mostly rewards right-wing carnival barkers. His new circus Capitalism A Love Story is the film he has been building to for two decades sprawling and scattershot yet with a cumulative force. Moores other films focused on symptoms. This one tackles the disease. Lets start with his conclusion Capitalism is an evil and you cannot regulate evila jaw-dropper given the sorry history of other economic systems. But Moore certainly clinches the case against people who say capitalism and democracy are sibling-close. Jefferson and Adams didnt think so. Nor did Jesus whom Moore redubs in an old Bible picture turning away a cripple because of a pre-existing condition. Moore relates a half-century of fraud in singsong narration that makes him seem like Mister Rogers with 200 extra pounds and a Che Guevara T-shirt instead of a cardigan. But what a figure he cuts. In the final sequence he pretends to try to make citizens arrests on Wall Street. On one level groan. On another No one else seems about to make those arrests. The only thing that would scare Wall Street straight is the image of Michael Moore as the new sheriff in town. Like some of her acting Drew Barrymores directing debut Whip It is a mite too adorably ingratiating especially for a story of a 17-year-old (Ellen Page) groomed for pageant life who gravitates to snarling girl punks and roller derby. But Barrymore hovers over her actresses like the nicest most nurturing den mother imaginable and on its own Go For It formula terms the movie delivers. Page is softer than in Hard Candy and Juno. Without Diablo Cody comebacks shes even more marvelous. A Serious Man Directed by Ethan and Joel Coen. Focus Features. R. Capitalism A Love Story Directed by Michael Moore. Overture Films. R.

Share Tweet Michael Moores smugness and self-aggrandizement sometimes works against his arguments but the agitprop documentarian has a gift for provocation and he knows how to simplify (some would say oversimplify) complicated political issues. Moores latest cine-essay Capitalism A Love Story is typically Moore-like for good and for ill. From the moment his ironically lilting voice appears over stock footage from pro-business industrial films Moore-haters will likely feel the urge to punch something. And as Moore proceeds to trot out a series of disconnected anecdotes as ""proof"" that the free market is an outmoded concept even staunch lefties may bristle at the speciousness of his arguments. Capitalism is intended to convince Americans that theyve bought into an economic system designed to screw them over but the tone is so smart-ass that its bound to put a lot of viewers into a default defensive posture. Still Capitalism is intermittently engaging even persuasive. When Moore describes a Pennsylvania community that disastrously privatized its juvenile detention facility the story may not show definitively that capitalism is immoral but it does offer a sharp rebuttal to those who insist that privatization always produces better results than the government. But even that section of the movie--like nearly every other section--would be stronger if Moore allowed the other side to make its best case rather relying on blurry images from the news and whispered insinuations of conspiracy. In general Moore seems to put more stock in the opinions of actors and Catholic priests than he does in actual economic decision-makers. (Or maybe its just that almost no one in a position of responsibility will talk to him anymore.) The biggest problem with Capitalism though is that it feels oddly out of touch. In the current political climate the kind of angry average American that Moore has spent a lifetime championing is more likely to be out in the streets yelling for the heads of liberals like himself while the kind of people sympathetic to Moores causes are likely watching The Daily Show and reading The Daily Dish. Given that the ""tea party"" movement was gaining momentum while Moore was putting this movie together it wouldve been genuinely dramatic to see him take his cameras into that throng to argue the virtues of socialism rather than shooting yet another scene outside an inaccessible corporate office. Capitalism shows that Moore is still capable of making valid points in an entertaining way but too often the movie consists of Moore reading yesterdays headlines snidely.

Mr. Moore is nothing if not forthright and no one if not a self-appointed Everyman with an unerring sense of timing. His latest film isnt really a documentary though it includes shots of such documents as the Constitution but a freewheeling denunciation of the capitalist system that is often mordantly funny and by lurching turns scornful rambling repetitive impassioned mock-lofty pseudo-lowbrow faux-naive persuasive tabloid-shameless and agit-prop-powerful. Once again hes on his own barricades doing whatever it takes to drive home provocative points in a movie that manages shrewdly even brilliantly to capitalize on the populist anger that has been sweeping the nation in the wake of financial turmoil government bailouts and persistent unemployment. The title fairly brilliant in its own right is only semisardonic. As the son of a General Motors auto worker and a child of the 1950s--which he sentimentalizes as a time of modesty probity and frugality as well as secure pensions--Mr. Moore was brought up to believe that American capitalism would provide an ever-rising standard of living for ever greater numbers of his fellow countrymen. According to the bullet points of his current belief system capitalism is evil sinful predatory self-destructive and doomed; an alliance of giant banks corporations and brokerage houses has abolished American democracy and a workers rebellion is either simmering or has already boiled over. As an alternative to the profit motive the filmmaker cites the example of Jonas Salk who gave the public his polio vaccine rather than patent it. For his part Mr. Moore gives the public plenty of snake oil. He blames government and industry for the decline of American unions without mentioning foreign competition. He illustrates the scandal of subprime mortgages with glib cross-cuts between bank executives and Mafia thugs. He shows the anguish of an eviction which he characterizes as ""a robbery"" without a clue to its factual context and assigns far-reaching significance to a family of Miami squatters in the process of reclaiming their repossessed house ""Sometimes"" he says ""revolutions begin in unlikely places."" In the ever-expanding universe of talk-radio yammer and cable-TV pontification Mr. Moore may sometimes seem like just another flinger of opinions or bringer of recycled news; little of the reporting in his film is original with him and most of his interview subjects are like-minded critics of the system. (""Do you think its too harsh to call what has happened here a coup detat a financial coup detat?"" he asks Marcy Kaptur a Democratic member of Congress from Ohio. She readily agrees ""The people here arent really in charge. Wall Street is in charge."") ENLARGE Michael Moore confronts a security guard in Capitalism A Love Story. Overture Films But audiences love him and no wonder for hes a special kind of star a buffo--as well as boffo--provocateur who knows how to manipulate the movie medium. (In a clip lifted from some old religious drama a newly dubbed Jesus says to a pitiable sufferer ""Im sorry I cannot heal your pre-existing condition."") As in previous films his ambushes are both amusing and absurd. Arriving at the headquarters of Goldman Sachs in an armored truck he tells a guard ""Were here to get the money back for the American people."" Reprising his 1989 confrontation from ""Roger amp; Me"" he shows up at the now-bankrupt General Motors where a guard recognizes him and radios with a trace of too-hip weariness ""Its Michael Moore to see the chairman."" Beyond using comedy as a satiric response to folly and tragedy ""Capitalism A Love Story"" combines sometimes tellingly and sometimes befuddlingly what we know what we think we know and what we fear about regulatory failures revolving doors between corporate and public life the excesses of the financial sector and the human consequences of a distressed economy. And it whips the frenzied events of last falls meltdown into a montage that suggests nothing less than the Apocalypse. Mr. Moore aims to proselytize his friends and demonize his enemies. His movie hits both marks. Coco Before Chanel Clothes may make the man but the woman makes the clothes in ""Coco Before Chanel"" Anne Fontaines smart and sumptuous French-language account of the legendary designer during her early years when she like her couture was still ascending from basse to haute. Coco is played by Audrey Tautou and shes phenomenal--self-contained tightly focused sparing with her smiles miserly with her joy often guarded to the point of severity yet giving off a grave radiance at every moment shes in front of the camera. You may remember Ms. Tautou most vividly as the fragile gamine in ""Amelie"" but that was almost a decade ago. The quirky ingenue has become a stunning woman. Still young and strikingly attractive she can be calmly commanding with a quick sharp tongue and a gift for speaking volumes through silence or a seizing glance. ENLARGE Audrey Tautou center is the title character in Coco Before Chanel. Sony Pictures Classics Read More A Style Is Born As befits a biographical film about a designer the film is meticulously designed. That means most obviously Catherine Leterriers Chanel-inspired costumes which provide a climactic fashion show worthy of an MGM musical; Olivier Radots splendid production design and Christophe Beaucarnes lovely cinematography. But the overall aesthetic predicting the spare elegant style for which Gabrielle ""Coco"" Chanel would come to be known expresses itself equally in the restraint of Ms. Fontaines direction and Alexandre Desplats score the precision of the script (which the director wrote with Camille Fontaine and among others the reliably incisive Christopher Hampton) and the economy of the performers starting but not ending with Ms. Tautou. Benoit Poelvoorde is Etienne Balsan the race-horse owner who takes young Coco in and treats her as a toy if not quite a courtesan but a toy hes genuinely fond of; its remarkable that Mr. Poelvoorde finds such depth and emotional variety in a man whos outwardly--and maybe inwardly--a shallow playboy. Allesandro Nivola is Arthur ""Boy"" Capel the Englishman who might have been but for intervening fate the one true love of Cocos life. Emmanuelle Devos is Emilienne an actress who enhances her career by wearing hats that Coco designs for her. What was true in the heroines life could never be untangled from what was invented. Coco Chanel who spent seven childhood years in an orphanage created part of her legend from her bountiful imagination. And the movie ends long before her infamously cozy relationship with Nazi authorities in occupied Paris during World War II. All the same its a special pleasure to watch this vibrant Coco taking in the world around her and turning it to her use in her fashion. Disgrace ""Disgrace"" an implacably somber adaptation of the J.M. Coetzee novel stars John Malkovich as David Lurie a 52-year-old professor of Romantic literature in postapartheid South Africa. Mr. Malkovich gambles--successfully--that we will be not only interested in but eventually fascinated by a man who sees himself as a soul mate of Byrons Lucifer ""a monster"" as Lurie says with exquisite self-loathing ""not possible to love and condemned to solitude."" If Ms. Tautous approach is self-containment Mr. Malkovichs performance is self-sealing like a safety container filled with explosives. ENLARGE John Malkovich stars in Disgrace. Paladin/Everett Collection The film demanding but ultimately rewarding was directed by Steve Jacobs from a screenplay by Anna-Maria Monticelli who has honored the books meaning and dark mystery. (Steve Arnold did the striking cinematography.) The disgrace of the title is self-inflicted at least at first. Weary of his career and a compulsive womanizer who diagnoses his condition as a Byronesque ""mad heart"" Lurie forces himself on a student in a brief squalid affair that can only end badly. Even deeper disgrace follows violent events during a visit to his daughter Lucy (Jessica Haines) who lives an ostensibly simple life on a remote farm. In fact nothing is simple in this film which ramifies into parallel meditations on race the transformation of racial politics and lessons to be learned from the lives of dogs. But the figure of the professor stands stark at the storys center. ""Disgrace"" charts the voyage of a soul so lost as to be nearly unfindable yet still available for redemption. DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Venus Beauty Institute (1999) Audrey Tautou has a small role in this French-language comedy set in an upscale Parisian spa. Shes one of the spas employees an adorable gamine--the word came up often in her early reviews--named Marie whos having an affair with an older man. In keeping with the subject of women working or being worked on Tonie Marshalls wise and graceful film is before anything else an exercise in visual seduction. Nathalie Baye stars as Angele a beautician in her 40s with a broken heart chronic guilt and a passionate aversion to the possibility of new love. ENLARGE A Very Long Engagement (2004) This period piece (the French title of which is ""Un Long Dimanche de Fiancailles"") is not exactly a walk in the park. Daring mood swings--and theme swings--lend distinction to Jean-Pierre Jeunets romantic epic. The narrative has been forged from a stunning re-creation of the horrors of World War I an often whimsical borderline-indecipherable detective story and best of all a love story about Audrey Tautous indomitable slip of a girl who refuses to believe that her fiance has died in the fetid trenches of the Somme. Theres never been anything quite like it. ENLARGE LAuberge Espagnole (2002) Last week I followed my review of Cedric Klapischs ""Paris"" with a tip on the DVD version of his early chamber drama ""A Family Resemblance."" This subsequent Klapisch film with Audrey Tautou in another small but ingratiating role is set in Barcelona. The inn of the title is an apartment where seven international students living communally decide to bring a French exchange student named Xavier (Romain Duris) into their messy fold after an interrogation that would impress any co-op board on Park Avenue. The apartment is both a tower of Babel and a vibrant microcosm of the new Europe. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Obama Trump Is Just Offering Slogans and Fear RNC vs. DNC Sizing Up the Conventions Obama Ends DNC Speech Im Ready to Pass the Baton Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillarys One-Candidate Race Opinion A Disunited Partys Successful Convention GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% The Olympic Fantasy Confronts Reality Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

"Capitalism A Love Story reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Capitalism A Love Story reviewed. Capitalism A Love Story reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 24 2009 433 PM Capitalism A Love Story Michael Moores latest simplistic infuriating inspiring documentary. By Dana Stevens Michael Moore inCapitalism A Love Story If you already dislike Michael Moore Capitalism A Love Story (Overture Films) his latest documentary/provocation/performance-piece/decoupage project isnt likely to win you over. And if you love him without reservations this movie has nothing to tell you that you havent already shouted through a bullhorn at a ""Free Mumia"" rally. But is there anyone who falls cleanly into that latter category of unabashed Moore love? The hulking Michiganders 20-year career as an agitprop prankster his stalwart refusal either to go away or to hone the blunt instrument of his demagogic style has made Moore a problem for the left and the right. Even those who largely agree with Moores politics are often mortified by the delivery system the juvenile stunts the easy demonization of his opponents the deliberate donning of blinders when a cogent counterargument comes along. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. And yet and yet Theres something touching even a little bit noble about Moores eternal willingness to serve as our nations shame-free populist gadfly. Woven into the two hours of loosely--very loosely--connected anecdotes that make up Capitalism is some information about Moore that if I knew it already hadnt registered before Hes a lifelong Catholic educated at parochial schools in Flint Mich. whose childhood dream was to enter the priesthood. He interviews several priests in this movie including the one who officiated at his own wedding. Seeing Moore as a working-class altar boy somehow put his strident buffoonery in a different light Perhaps all the goofy posturing and put-on naivete is Moores way of playing the holy fool. Advertisement That rhetorical deployment of innocence works well for Moore when hes telling his own story or those of people close to him. When he and his aged father visit a ravaged former GM plant and talk about the 30-plus years his father worked there making spark plugs the film has a rare moment of elegiac quiet. When Moores cameras chronicle a successful sit-in at a Chicago factory the unimpeachable justness of the workers cause--they were abruptly terminated without severance pay benefits or even the remaining salary owed to them--leaves the viewer with a satisfyingly righteous glow. And a section on the steadily decreasing salaries of airline pilots is both depressing and informative as we see Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger the pilot hero who made that emergency landing in the Hudson River in January testifying before a near-empty Congress about the need to guarantee pilots a living wage. But as soon as Moore takes on larger and slipperier issues his gray-area-free moral clarity starts to feel like a dodge. The opening titles take place over security-camera footage of bank robberies making clear Moores opinion of the financial bailout In his eyes Henry Paulson and his former Wall Street cronies are stickup artists pure and simple. However outraged one may be about the corporate greed that led the banking system to the verge of collapse it seems disingenuous to imply that the collapse would not have happened had nothing been done. Even left-leaning economists argued for the necessity of some kind of rescue package a reality that Moore ignores entirely. (By chopping up her interview into unfairly small sound bites he even makes Elizabeth Warren the tireless watchdog who heads the Congressional Oversight Panel look like a do-nothing bureaucrat.) In the movies most painfully redundant scenes Moore approaches the Manhattan headquarters of Goldman Sachs and other investment banks and stands outside with a bag asking the doorman to let him in to reclaim Americas money. Now that 20 years have passed since his first film Roger and Me can we all just agree to tap into our collective memory of these moments when Moore is refused entry into corporate high-rises by polite and embarrassed doormen (all of whom belong to the working class he so loves to champion)? We get it Mike The head of GM will not see you. The chairman of Goldman Sachs will not see you. The secretary of the U.S. Treasury will not see you. Waste any more footage on this tired gag and your loyal fan base may start to feel the same way. One section of the film deals with so-called ""dead peasant"" insurance policies a malevolent practice in which large companies (including for a period in the 90s Wal-Mart) take out hefty policies on employees who seem unlikely to die essentially betting on the odds of their survival. Moore interviews the families of two Wal-Mart employees who were horrified to learn after their beloveds deaths that the company stood to profit by them (in one case to the tune of 1.5 million). The way Moore gathers one such family around the kitchen table then leaves the camera on the childrens faces while their father remembers their mothers final days feels exploitive and crass. The scene makes you cry yes--who wouldnt when hearing how a little girl asked whether she could cut a hole in the hospital wall to see her mother one last time?--but it seems like something you shouldnt be allowed to see. Once again Moores goodhearted aims come into direct conflict with his bludgeoning tactics. Despite his semi-ironic deployment of Communist signifiers (Stalin appears in one of his montages of Cold War footage and the closing credits are accompanied by a big-band version of ""The Internationale"") I doubt that the hammer Moore uses to drive home his ideological points is really accompanied by a Marxist sickle. The change Moore is advocating for is really increased regulation of capitalist excesses not an overthrow of the free-market system itself. (In the last sentence of the voice-over he claims that the ideal replacement for capitalism is ""democracy"" collapsing the economic and the political in typically unrigorous Moore style.) Moores choice to make ""capitalism"" his straw man (rather than say greed or Reagan-era deregulation) puts him in closer company than he might like with some pretty nasty world-historical bedfellows. More to the point it hurts his credibility with those who might otherwise be persuaded by his powers as a comic agitator a clown for social justice.

ABOUT THE MOVIECapitalism A Love Story   (out of four) Director Michael MooreDistributor Overture FilmsRating R for some languageRunning time 2 hours 7 minutesNow playing in selct cities. Opens nationwide Oct. 2.  WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Capitalism A Love Story may be the timeliest documentary in Michael Moores two-decade career. No matter what side of the political fence youre on or what you think of Moore as an activist and provocateur a film that explores the economic meltdown and its historical roots is something most of us can get our heads around. Capitalism is impassioned informative and entertaining if sometimes repetitive. Moore has never pretended to be objective. Few documentarians are. The minute a camera is aimed at a subject subjectivity sets in. Moore may be the most overtly biased major filmmaker and therefore a figure some love to hate. His facts and assertions will continue to be debated with Capitalism as they were with his past films. But his populist sensibility and lively filmmaking techniques are put to good use. Capitalism is as entertaining as Roger amp; Me and its critique skewers both major political parties calling into question the economic policies of Bill Clinton as well as Ronald Reagan. This is quintessential Moore with a clear-cut agenda Capitalism has superseded democracy encouraged corruption and greed and failed our nation. Political bigwigs and wealthy executives may love it but its not working for the majority of Americans. His thesis may enrage amuse or inspire depending on your ideology and your wallet. Moore makes his case with humor humanity and outrageous scenarios intended to get people fired up. His rallying cry is simple The country needs to return to its democratic roots. The film intersperses interviews with historical footage even unearthing a riveting address by Franklin Roosevelt. He travels from Wall Street to Washington and all around the USA documenting sheriffs forcibly evicting families from foreclosed homes. The recurring theme The rich have gotten richer and everyone else has suffered. He likens the fall of Wall Street to the decline of the Roman Empire juxtaposing absurdly funny visuals. But hes deadly serious. In an eye-opening interview Moore talks to a widow who discovered her husbands employer had taken out and cashed a huge life insurance policy on him. He also discovers the prevalence of this practice in corporate America. Its not all doom and financial gloom. Americans are not powerless his documentary posits. Moore traces the much-publicized story of striking workers at a Chicago factory who fought their layoffs and finally were compensated. Twenty years ago Roger amp; Me focused on disenfranchised General Motors workers and the financial ruin of Moores hometown of Flint Mich. He has since made films about gun control (Bowling for Columbine) the presidency of George W. Bush (Fahrenheit 9/11) and the state of health care (Sicko). The growing divide between the haves and have-nots is something Moore has railed about in all his films. Moore has the rare ability to present economics and history in an engaging and comprehensive fashion. Consequently his movies draw large audiences and spur debate. And films that inspire contemplation and elicit discussion are welcome relief in a medium increasingly dominated by formulaic and mindless diversion. (Rated R for some language.

""Capitalism A Love Story"" Movie Review -- Like every Michael Moore movie ""Capitalism A Love Story"" is supposed to make you mad. Like every Michael Moore movie I have seen it made me mad for some reasons he didnt intend. The frustrating thing is that I agree with Moore on a lot of the populist points hes making. I always do whether its that shipping jobs overseas is bad for the country (""The Big One"") or that our health care system chiefly serves the insurance companies (""Sicko""). Capitalism A Love Story (R) Overture Films (120 min.) Directed by Michael Moore. Now playing in New York. STEPHEN WHITTYS RATING TWO AND A HALF STARS Rating note The film contains strong language. But I didnt like it in ""Roger amp; Me"" or ""Fahrenheit 911"" when he juggled timelines or made reckless insinuations. And I certainly didnt like it when he confronted a doddering Charlton Heston in ""Bowling for Columbine"" (and then later classlessly suggested the actor didnt really have Alzheimers). No no matter how much Rush and OReilly hate him Moore remains his own worst enemy. And thats a shame because hes developed into a good filmmaker -- ""Capitalism"" is a terrifically edited movie full of strong sequences looking at the economic meltdown and at the very human face of all those dry statistics. Heres footage of people being evicted from their farm in the family for four decades. Here are close-ups of people sobbing one after another as Moore talks about their exploitation at the hands of big business faceless banks and Wall Street speculators. But Moores exploiting them too. One long sequence for example focuses on the practice of companies quietly taking out insurance policies on lower-rung blue-collar employees -- and then cashing in big if the people die. Ghoulish? Certainly. But the employers were the ones paying the premiums. How does this harm the survivors? It doesnt. But it gives Moore a chance to turn the cameras on and prod audiences into sobs. Another sequence focuses on evictions. A horrible thing of course. But typically Moore arrives just in time to film peoples possessions being thrown into the gutter -- but too late to really explore how they got into this mess. Is everything always the banks fault? Is it only the guys in suits who can get greedy? In Moores world yes it is. ""Capitalism A Love Story"" has individual moments of real power but no solid intellectual arguments. How could it when Moore keeps jumping around offering snapshots of everything from a hideous for-profit juvenile-detention center to the low pay of airline pilots to his usual show-up-unannounced shenanigans. Moore it seems doesnt want to offer solid intellectual arguments beyond the fairly radical assertion that capitalism is antithetical to democracy and that what the United States needs to do is move to some sort of socialist system of guaranteed housing and workers co-ops. Well -- fine. If thats the argument he really wants to make Id like to hear him seriously make it. But Moore wont stand still long enough. Instead hes off clowning around wrapping the facades of Wall Street buildings with ""crime scene"" tape. Or playing to the fringes on both sides calling the bailout programs a ""financial coup detat."" Or just shamelessly amping up the emotions giving us conflict without context. This isnt a documentary its a call to the streets shouted through a bullhorn. But whos listening? Who in the end is Michael Moore actually reaching by sneering at ""the profit motive"" and ""the free-enterprise system?"" Not the people who vote. Not the people who change things. Just the people who go to his movies -- and make him rich. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

BOTTOM LINE Shtick doesnt begin to describe Moores style; lazy doesnt begin to describe his thinking. CAST Michael Moore Wallace Shawn Bill Black Elizabeth Warren LENGTH 145 Proving that demagoguery can come as easily from the left as from the right Michael Moore has produced a jerry-rigged jeremiad about free enterprise that hands up some very legitimate indictments without really making a case. Or certainly not the case he thinks hes making. Stylistically Moore is spinning his wheels We get the same soft-spoken faux-folksy righteously indignant spokesman of ""Bowling for Columbine"" and ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" the same profiles of simple people shafted by the system the same implicit ridicule of other simple people who are just trying to keep their job by doing things Moore doesnt approve of. And enough convenient logic to bury the Federal Reserve. Happily for Moore ""Capitalism"" is likely to exploit the widespread anger over bank bailouts and profligate corporations but in attempting to make a grand gesture Moores reach exceeds his grasp. advertisement | advertise on newsday Most of what he rails against isnt about economic philosophy its about immorality; greed is certainly the lifeblood of capitalism but greed is eternal and its human failing that has Moore at the ramparts where he shrinks from making the big connections. That various corporations took out life insurance on employees and benefited from their deaths is low but it isnt criminal and it doesnt even victimize the survivors. But if Moore could have accused Wal-Mart of denying health care to its employees in an effort to collect death benefits that would have been something. While Moore is happy to imply the worst innuendo is all we get. MoviesTrailer Capitalism A Love Story Moore shares the blame for financial atrocities pretty fairly - he names Democrats as well as Republicans who have bellied up to the Wall Street-catered trough. But his trademark antics - wrapping Goldman Sachs in crime-scene tape using a bullhorn to order Wall Street malefactors into the street with their hands up or hassling security guards to give back ""Americas Money"" seem cheap hackneyed and trite. Too bad There was probably a good movie even a funny movie to be made here but Moore has too much contempt for his audience to think theyd understand anything beyond the cartoonishness that is ""Capitalism.""

Photo Getty Images CAPITALISM A Love Story"" sounded like my kind of film. I had heard Michael Moore found some exciting new historical footage and I was picturing hot steamy love scenes featuring Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan writhing atop piles of gold coins. Imagine my disappointment. The movie turns out to be like a 70s sitcom that starts normally but then somebody says ""Say this reminds me of that time Marcia got hit in the nose with a football . . ."" and we veer off into a clip show. So heres Michael trying to get into the HQ of GM and being turned away by security just as he was 20 years ago in ""Roger amp; Me."" Heres campy archival footage showing communist soldiers on the march and George W. Bush being silly at a photo op. Oh and here is busted logic self-contradiction tasteless jokes and ideas that are demonstrably empirically wrong. Then there are calls for armed revolution delivered in Moores trademark singsong Bolshie bedtime-story voice. The movie ends with Moore telling us ""Capitalism is evil and you cannot regulate evil. You have to eliminate it."" Then he plays the bloodthirsty Soviet national anthem ""The Internationale."" With one exception his biggest ""gets"" arent much. A North Carolina family (no identifying details are provided here or in most cases so theres no way of looking into the real story) has locked itself in a foreclosed house. Noises outside. Handheld camera. How Blair Witchy Except that the sheriffs enter in the most polite way imaginable delicately popping out a lock instead of busting down the door. A scarier foreclosure victim whom Moore lovingly shows gathering his guns (his antigun position of ""Bowling for Columbine"" has become inconvenient) mutters about how he understands why when it comes to banks ""People go in there with bombs blow em up shoot people . . . anything that happens to them they deserve."" Moore approves. He tells us in voice-over ""The only thing we didnt know is when the revolt would begin"" -- one of several cheers for armed uprising although what exactly his viewers in Santa Monica and on the Upper West Side will rise up against is anybodys guess. The return policy at J.Crew? Moore says he is the first to unearth film of FDR promising a ""second bill of rights"" which is a valuable historical find if a vapid one intellectually. Roosevelt thought he could guarantee a job for all and Moore says that Europe and Japan put that policy into practice. Spain though which has had a Socialist prime minister for five years has an 18 percent unemployment rate. At his most bizarre Moore waxes nostalgic about the lavish compensation of his dad a GM union man proving our host is the last person on the planet to comprehend that the UAW bankrupted GM. ""For 20 years I tried to warn GM that this day was coming"" Moore claims. Actually for 20 years he tried to hasten this days arrival by razzing GM for cost cutting that kept it barely afloat. Moore makes the same case for airlines which were also bankrupted by unions and blames the Buffalo commuter-plane crash last winter on the low pay of its pilots. This is science by anecdote Moore thinks one crash proves air travel is getting more dangerous. Statistics say he is lying. A longish segment stars Pennsylvania judges who sentenced kids to a for-profit juvie center in exchange for kickbacks -- but since this is illegal and the judges are being prosecuted (both pleaded guilty in February but then withdrew their pleas in September) doesnt this prove that capitalism coexists with anti-corruption laws? Moores guests are ventriloquists dummies he props up on his knee so they can present views he shares. Doll-size actor-playwright Wallace Shawn is shown as a sage of economics because apparently he took a course on it once. Moore asks Ohio Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur whether the financial bailout was a financial ""coup detat"" and she chirps the phrase back at him. Driving an armored car to financial firms Moore demands his money back -- but isnt it Washington that took money from the taxpayers? Shouldnt Moore run his yellow crime-scene tape around the White House instead of Wall Street? Anyway President Obama said this month that in cases where the government has fully sold its TARP bank holdings it has gotten back its money plus 17 percent. Damn those capitalist barons breaking into our treasury and filling it with their filthy money. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Starr report Read Next Starr report Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 26604 How Hillary blew her big moment 16713 Malia Obama skipped the DNC for Lollapalooza 11143 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary Jill and Joe Biden stop traffic on Fifth Avenue SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

The back-scratching greed and corruption the cult of Wall Street as a casino for elites the subprime mortgage vendors who operated like loan sharks Moore pulls the big picture together and much of the movie (about three-fifths of it) is urgent unsettling and mischievously funny. Yet I wish -- oh how I wish -- that Moore had restrained himself from painting Americas sins with too broad a brush. Pointing his finger at ""capitalism"" Moore sounds a little too much like Rush Limbaugh getting hot under the collar about ""socialism."" In both cases they?re not making an argument -- they?re demonizing a word. Early on Moore who narrates the movie in his trademark tone of bedtime-fairy-tale sarcasm creates a memorable montage of the 50s and 60s taking us back to a more secure and in some ways egalitarian America. For Moore the transformative moment was the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980. Capitalism A Love Story is most potent when it shows us what the financial desperation and ruthless corporate squeezing that descended from that era now look like. Theres an astonishing section about companies that take out life-insurance policies on their employees profiting from their deaths and Moore squeezes a great deal of symbolic mileage out of the fact that airline pilots have been reduced to beleaguered wage slaves who routinely make less than 20000 a year. Then theres the federal governments 700 billion bank bailout which for Moore is a conspiracy an officially sanctioned robbery. Here as in the health-care doc Sicko (2007) Moores real subject is the collapse of the social contract. Thats a powerful theme but why did he have to make the films villain nothing less than?capitalism itself? Moore depicts the very concept of American free enterprise as inherently unjust. But even if you believe that deregulation in the 80s went too far that unchecked capitalism is a voracious beast that can eat a culture alive you may have a hard time swallowing the films finale in which Moore trashes our system as ""evil"" and pushes for a citizens ""revolt."" At its best Capitalism A Love Story is a searing outcry against the excesses of a cutthroat time. At its worst its dorm-room Marxism.

"Capitalism A Love Story - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-CapitalismMOVIE REVIEW Capitalism A Love StoryMichael Moore tackles a big subject with a scattershot approach. But some of the individual parts prove classic.September 23 2009|KENNETH TURAN | FILM CRITIC Say what you like about Michael Moore he certainly knows how to pick his subjects. ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" was so au courant about the invasion of Iraq it won the 2004 Palme dOr at Cannes and 2007s ""Sicko"" got the jump on the current healthcare imbroglio. Now barely a year after the Wall Street meltdown ""Capitalism A Love Story"" examines in typical love-it-or-leave-it Moore fashion the causes of the collapse of the century.""Capitalism"" is not just Moores latest documentary it is as the filmmaker himself has said ""the movie Ive been making for the past 20 years."" He lays the ills of American society that hes chronicled over all that time at the feet of an out-of-control free-market system he so detests that he puts priests on camera to talk about capitalism as morally evil.Clearly Moore has not lost his provocateurs gift for stirring the pot and it is heartening to have a filmmaker take on a subject this all-encompassing and almost taboo. But not even Moores skill can quell the suspicion that ""Capitalism"" misses the narrower focus that gave his earlier films some of their punch.In a sense ""Capitalism"" comes by its wide-ranging scattershot approach naturally. After all this is a heck of a big subject Just ask Karl Marx who spent 18 years researching and writing his multi-volume ""Das Kapital."" So its perhaps inevitable because of the ton of territory ""Capitalism"" covers that this film ends up as the sum of its parts nothing more."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""160""gt;That said Moores scattershot is a lot more interesting than some filmmakers focus and many of those individual parts are classic. For one thing Moore retains the instincts of a shrewd stand-up comedian -- the astonished baffled looks he often wears are a case in point as is his decision to include under the rubric of ""When did Jesus become a capitalist?"" the dubbing of a section of a biblical epic with free-market platitudes.And Moore has not lost his zest for confrontational antics. He asks New York financial workers to explain derivatives drives an armored car up to AIG corporate headquarters and demands the company return federal bailout funds even surrounds all of Wall Street with yellow ""crime scene"" tape to emphasize his low opinion of the areas activities.One of the things that is new about ""Capitalism"" is an emphasis on the filmmakers personal life. He talks about how inspired by Daniel Berrigan he wanted to be an activist priest and he goes with his dad to the site of the former AC spark plug plant in Flint Mich. -- now a vacant lot -- where his father spent satisfying decades as a union-protected assembly-line worker.The main point Moore wants to make the thing that drives him craziest is his notion that capitalism far from being a system that rewards excellence is a scheme set up to make a profit on absolutely anything. He fears it has in recent decades turned American society into a culture that says money is the only value and he has a number of cases he wants to use to make his point. These include The scandal surrounding a for-profit juvenile detention center in Wilkes-Barre Pa. in which two judges got millions of dollars in kickbacks from the owners for sending more than a thousand juveniles to the establishment. The little-noticed portion of the congressional testimony of Chesley B. ""Sully"" Sullenberger III the US Airways pilot who miraculously landed his plane on New Yorks Hudson River who told legislators that his pay has been cut 40% in recent years and his pension terminated. The strategy of major firms to take out life insurance policies on their employees -- known in the trade as ""dead peasant insurance"" -- that pays off to the companies not to the employees survivors.Though he started on ""Capitalism"" before last years Wall Street meltdown Moore delves into that collapse as well. While another documentary Leslie Cockburns ""American Casino"" does a better job with the questions surrounding massive housing foreclosures Moores film aided by strong statements from Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) raises questions about the nature of the multibillion-dollar government bailout.At the end of the day perhaps the most startling thing about ""Capitalism"" is that Moore stands revealed not as some pointy-headed socialist but as an unreconstructed New Deal Democrat who admires Franklin D. Roosevelt believes in increased democracy and opportunity and feels that the decades-long weakening of unions has fatally weakened America. The fact that this will be a controversial stance says as much about todays political culture as it does about Moores place in it."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""110""gt;--kenneth.turanlatimes.com--Capitalism A Love StoryMPAA rating R for some languageRunning time 2 hours 7 minutesPlaying At the ArcLight in Hollywood and the Landmark in West L.A."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""110""gt; MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement "");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""300"" height=""250""gt;MORE STORIES ABOUTCapitalismMichael MooreCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-capitalism23-2009sep23,0,178374.story",200,capitalismalovestory27,capitalismalovestory,latimes

(Overture Films) Joe Neumaier Wednesday September 23 2009 1134 AM Title Capitalism A Love Story Holding his country close but wanting things to be better is Michael Moores approach in ""Capitalism A Love Story."" The same reaction may greet the movie which contains a target that may be too big even for the Oscar-winning documentarian and veteran rabble-rouser.Unlike his last work the more-urgent-than-ever health-care takedown ""Sicko"" (a re-release right now would be perfect) ""Capitalism"" is like watching a man wrestle a dozen octopuses. Moores far-reaching approach was used far more successfully in ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" and ""Bowling for Columbine.""""Capitalism"" begins with a funny but hackneyed comparison of present-day America to pre-fall Rome before focusing on families in the midst of home foreclosure. Then Moore sits ridiculously with playwright/actor Wallace Shawn the films first talking head. While its always great to see him Wallace Shawn should not be the opening salvo on the dangers of free enterprise.Still Moore is in top form as he tracks the countrys ""love affair"" with the capitalist system from the 50s through the Reagan era then attacks -- sometimes physically -- Goldman Sachs Citigroup the Congressional bailout and greedy CEOs. Unfortunately in-between are narrative asides worthy of their own movies (underpaid airline pilots corporations profiting from the deaths of workers) but which distract from more pertinent scenes including fired workers staging a sit-in strike until they receive their final paychecks or interest-rate-gouged citizens paid to move their own furniture so a bank can resell their home.Its as if Moores seething at corporate greed flustered him making him flail furiously at shadows. Its telling that the films hardest-hitting points are made by Franklin Roosevelt (in a 1944 presidential address which the right wing might today call ""socialist indoctrination"").The film works best when Moore sits with representatives of the 99 percent of Americans vulnerable to financial freefall - potential ""dead peasants"" to use an insurance term he highlights - and visits his rust-belt-beaten hometown of Flint Michigan. Flint has been part of Moores movies since 1989s ""Roger amp; Me"" and here as ever it represents what makes him tick A very real anger at the trickery and tragedy visited upon the countrys blue-collar working people by politicians propaganda and a modern capitalist system that allows for inhumane repercussions.Thats at the heart of ""Capitalism A Love Story."" Too bad its wide net ultimately results in diminishing returns. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

The shirts and the movie are brought to you by those filthy Reds Overture Films--which is owned by John Malone the Limbaugh-loving media magnate who was fined a hefty 1.4 million this summer by the Justice Department for illegal stock purchases.Such are the contradictions of late capitalism and I wish that more of them had made it into this scattershot lazy slice of agitprop which recycles Moores usual slice-and-dice job on corporations while bobbing a curtsey to the current crisis.Less a movie than a traveling circus Capitalism is cobbled together from the directors usual toolbox of film clips pseudo-triumphalist choral scores potted labor history and staged stunts with the directors left-leaning pals--in this case a downright baffling shopping trip with a bemused Wallace Shawn to illustrate the oxymoronic doublespeak of free market.Moore is a skilled court jester and theres some bitter fun in the sight of a Harvard economist tying himself in knots trying to define a derivative or Moore wrapping the perimeter of AIG headquarters in crime-scene yellow tape like some unhinged Christo. But if youve seen his other films--the footage of former Treasury Secretary Donald Regan whispering to a speechifying President Reagan to ""speed it up"" or Reagan the actor slapping a woman on screen intercut with footage of marching feminists--a dubbed-over Jesus spewing corporate doublespeak feels like old hat. Mostly Capitalism is a point-by-point retread of Moores 1989 film Roger amp; Me with Moore trying and failing once more to gain entry to the offices of General Motors. He notes but doesnt much pursue the fact that the company is now bankrupt. Instead he goes on pummeling the corporations and the legislators who sit in their laps in the usual way. If Capitalism feels stale its partly because Moore isnt trying very hard but more crucially because one way or another now everyone knows about or has felt the sting of the current crisis firsthand.If economic collapse has done anything to change Moores position it has been to push him further--or at least more explicitly--to the left. Contrary to its strategically ambiguous title whose irony is designed to make hip liberals nod their knowing heads without scaring off the hard right (as if theyd show up for anything with Michael Moore in the credits) Capitalism is the most purely Marxist film Moore has ever made. Its purpose is not just to go after corporations and their sidekicks in Congress but also to fully come out of the closet and acknowledge free enterprise as evil. Quite an admission from a man who on this side of the Atlantic never identifies himself as a socialist--unless hes talking to Canadians.Predictably Capitalism played well with Moores most loyal constituency the college-educated young blades at my screening who clapped when Dennis Kucinichs face filled the screen and gave the movie a standing ovation. Will the lifelong Republicans and conservative Democrats whose lives have been shredded by the worst slump since the Great Depression show up assuming they can still afford a trip to the multiplex? Unlikely but if they did theyd see their daily plight writ large in the movies genuinely touching moments unadorned by Moores cloying habit of milking pathos for every last drop.We see Moore walking his elderly but still sharp father around the razed lot that was once the spark-plug factory where he had worked all his life visiting companies that are making a go out of profit-sharing and chatting with the sheriff who put an end to foreclosures in his town. Though theres little here that we dont see already on TV news youd have to have a heart of stone not to be moved by the victims of foreclosure and shady bank deals who allow the director into their shattered lives. The last word goes to a gun owner whom we watch packing up his home and then heartbreakingly being paid a measly 1000 to clean up the site by the very bank that foreclosed on him. ""Theres the people thats got it all and the people who dont have nothing"" he says bitterly. Charlie Marx must be shouting ""Toldja"" from his grave.

By returning to his roots professional gadfly Michael Moore turns in one of his best films with ""Capitalism A Love Story."" Pics target is less capitalism qua capitalism than the banking industry which Moore skewers ruthlessly explaining last years economic meltdown in terms a sixth-grader could understand. That said theres still plenty here to annoy right-wingers as well as those who however much they agree with Moores politics just cant stomach his oversimplification on-the-nose sentimentality and goofball japery. Whether ""Capitalism"" matches ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" or underperforms like ""Sicko"" will depend on how much workers of the world are ready to unite behind the message. Pic reaped mostly ecstatic applause at its first press screening in Venice -- no great surprise given the largely leftist persuasion of film-fest auds especially in Europe. Still ""Capitalisms"" worldview is resolutely U.S.-centric apart from the odd approving mention of some foreign nation. Nevertheless pic is likely to make considerably more offshore where ""socialism"" isnt considered a cuss word than at home. Another commercial factor to consider is whether by the time the Overture release rolls out Oct. 2 most auds might feel too bored with or depressed about the economy to engage with the pic despite its ultimately upbeat power-to-the-people message. A release six months ago when the crisis was still very raw might have been surfed the zeitgeist more effectively. Ironically given the current debate over President Obamas health-care plans ""Sicko"" might have suited the times better. Sticking largely to the template laid down in his earlier films particularly ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" and ""Sicko"" (""Roger and Me"" and ""Bowling for Columbine"" had more linear structures with specific stories to tell) ""Capitalism"" skips around considerably laying down a mix of reportage interviews and polemic. In the opening reels alone auds are introduced to ordinary folk whose homes are being repossessed; a gleefully unabashed real estate agent who specializes in finding bargains on foreclosed properties; immaculately researched archival footage presenting crew-cut 1950s squares extolling the virtues of capitalism; and homemovies showing Moore as a tow-headed child visibly overjoyed to be visiting Wall Street on a vacation to New York from his hometown of Flint Mich. The helmer is a very visible onscreen presence here throughout which detractors will decry as self-indulgent. But the decision is justified given how relevant the damage done to the American automobile industry is to the banking crisis as well as the the central role GM played in ""Roger and Me"" excerpts of which are shown here and the fact that Moores father worked in the motor biz. Theres genuine poignancy even surprising restraint and dignity in a scene where father and son visit the vacant lot that once housed the factory where the elder Moore worked. Unfortunately elsewhere Moore strives so hard to manipulate viewers emotions with shots of crying children and tearjerking musical choices that hes not so much over-egging the pudding as making an omelet out of it. While it could be argued that Moore needs to milk the human-interest stories for all their worth to get auds to engage with his denunciation of capitalism more often than not such tactics just patronize the audience and descend into cheap sentimentality. Moore all but stops short of holding up dead puppies Hank Paulson personally murdered. Moore is on much more persuasive ground when he holds back and lets a good story tell itself in drier terms recalling his best muckraking work in the tube series ""TV Nation"" and ""The Awful Truth."" Theres a horrifying yet absurd account little known outside the U.S. of judges bribed to send as many juvenile offenders as possible to detention centers in Wilkes-Barre Pa. some for offenses as trivial as ridiculing an assistant principal on MySpace. Also recalling the grassroots activism of his TV work are rousing segments of workers protesting Bank of Americas refusal to pay them money owed when the company goes into receivership along with calls elsewhere to if not arms at least civil disobedience. No Michael Moore film would be complete without scenes of the writer-helmer arguing with security guards in glassy office-building foyers as he attempts to have an impromptu word with the companys CEO. Predictably ill-fated attempts are made to storm the citadels of various banks and financial institutions that survived the crash. In perhaps the funniest moment Moore tries to find a banker who can explain what derivatives are; he corners one and says he wants some advice to which the reply comes quick as a flash ""Stop making films"" Moore shows no signs of heeding this injunction and ends the pic on a combatative note vowing ""I refuse to live in a country like this and Im not leaving."" Its a pugnacious riposte to his right-wing critics but in the end Moore also fails to answer his left-wing doubters who will have plenty of evidence here that Moores argument is less with capitalism as Marx and Engels understood it or even as the North Koreans and Cubans do than with capitalisms most egregious excesses in the U.S. His ideal is not the end of private ownership just more cooperatively owned businesses where everyone shares the wealth and makes collective decisions. Moore merely flirts with counterpointing socialism with capitalism and ultimately sets up an inoffensive-to-the-point-of-meaningless notion of democracy as capitalisms opposite. Original footage looks almost deliberately cruddy as if shaky camerawork were a badge of authenticity. Sound was also a bit muddy at the screening caught but editing credited to seven different names is aces throughout.
