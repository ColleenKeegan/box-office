Returning from military school delinquent son Michael (Penn Badgley) finds his mother (Sela Ward) living with creepy superficially charming stranger David (Dylan Walsh). His mother is smitten her friends are sceptical but supportive and Michaels two siblings try to rub along. But Michael thinks David is too good to be true especially after the crazy cat lady remarks on the interlopers resemblance to an FBI photo-fit of a guy who slaughtered his entire family six months before. Thanks to Terry OQuinns chilling central performance and a script by crime novelist Donald E Westlake Rubens version emphasised the irony of a real estate agent obsessed with creating the perfect family home. Dylan Walshs one-note portrayal of the sociopathic David is a poor substitute while director Nelson McCormick and hack writer J S Cardone have replaced savage social comment with lame thriller cliches. The best they can come up with is a few modern plot gimmicks to do with mobile phones. Spare a thought for slender actress Amber Heard who as the suspicious Michaels neglected girlfriend Kelly is reduced to modelling a brief bikini. At least she was spared the gratuitous shower scene that earned Jill Schoelen her short-lived teen scream queen status.

Drawn from two Earhart bios Mira Nairs dull hagiography comes in about 111 minutes too long. Swanks Earhart is all grinning can-do at fault for nothing her only conflicts coming through the misunderstanding of a chauvinist materialist society unprepared for her barnstorming beauty. Beyond her record flights the film covers Earharts courtship with and marriage to publicist G.P. Putnam (Richard Gere) an architect of the Lindbergh legend and her free-love affair with Gores dad Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor). Amelia is pinned uncomfortably between ""chase your dreams"" PG-safe and aspirations of sophistication. For a woman to write as we see Earhart doing a prenuptial condition that ""I shall not hold you to any medieval code of faithfulness to me nor shall I consider myself bound to you"" would be gutsy in 2009 not to mention mere years after suffrage theres little sense of the emotional risk Earharts taking with that declaration and the resulting menage a trois lacks heat. Period details from 1928 to 1937 are so cliched that someone might as well announce onscreen ""Gosh these 20s certainly are Roaring"" (Citywide) (Nick Pinkerton) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - AS SEEN THROUGH THESE EYES Its an angle many Hitler historians cant leave alone As a young aspiring painter the fuhrer was rejected by the Vienna Art Institute; as a murderous dictator he remained an art lover looting Europe of its greatest treasures. The facts are there yet their melodramatic invocation does more harm than good to As Seen Through These Eyes a documentary about the creative impulse that sustained many young prisoners of World War II concentration camps. Distractingly tortured metaphors are given a distractingly affected narration by Maya Angelou the embittered Hitler ""refocused his passion for painting into a new art form"" and soon ""no one was safe from his sweeping paintbrush of death and destruction."" Inside this hackneyed frame are the actual subjects of the documentary many of whom are Auschwitz survivors who discuss their experiences and display their powerful wartime drawings and paintings. It must be tough being the worlds 7000th Holocaust documentary; there arent a lot of fresh angles left and recorded Holocaust images -- occasionally used here without identifying context as if they were interchangeable -- have become so codified that one wonders if that interchangeability is the ultimate sacrilege. But the artwork -- the product of individual experience and expression rather than an anonymous camera -- returns the horror of the camps to its proper piercing register. (Music Hall; Town Center 5) (Michelle Orange)ASTRO BOY Is it impossible to bottle childhood nostalgia in a movie? On the heels of Where the Wild Things Are comes Astro Boy a CGI-animated origin story for the legendary cartoon hero of the same name who first appeared in Osamu Tezukas 1951 futuro-Pinocchio manga comic. Westernized and sterilized the still-nippleless rocket-thrusting robo-kid now wears pants flies without his classic theme song and all but ignores his cult following to focus on merchandising to next-gen kiddies. But the fable stays intact After smarty-pants schoolboy Toby (voiced by Freddie Highmore) -- son of the genius Dr. Tenma (Nicolas Cage) -- is accidentally killed while presenting an experiment to the villainous General Stone (Donald Sutherland) Daddy builds a tricked-out android version made from his sons memories. But Astro is not Toby and so ends up treated like the robotic servants who wait on humans hand and wheel throughout this shiny metropolis hovering in the sky. Further class struggles erupt on the discarded Earth surface where junkyard urchins wave their fists up at those metro types and Astro ends up fighting baddies in both realms while looking for a family to call his own. Corny but goodhearted the film tries hard not to annoy parents with animation more fizzy than frantic and nerdy references to Asimovs law of robotics Kant and Freaks ""One of us one of us"" (Citywide) (Aaron Hillis)THE CANYON Another one for the bad-stuff-happens-to-stupid-people file The Canyon might at least offer the satisfaction of a few squirmy thrills if it werent so insistent on treating its central couples plight as the stuff of high tragedy. When newlyweds Nick (Eion Bailey) and Lori (Yvonne Strahovski) find their dream of riding mules through the Grand Canyon thwarted by local prohibitions they enlist the weird grizzled dude they meet at the bar to serve as their guide. But after leading them far off the beaten path Henry (Will Patton) falls prey to a snakebite and offering up a lame warning about nature taking its revenge on mankind dies leaving the two to fend for themselves. As they become progressively more lost the blandly handsome young couple find that the blandly handsome Arizona wilderness -- filmed by director Richard Harrah with picture-post card banality -- isnt as bland (or as handsome) as it seems. But despite the obvious dangers -- and a gruesome amputation -- the film goes light on action and suspense alike so that most of its running time is spent focused on two dullards spouting inane dialogue or doing dumb shit like trying to make cell-phone calls while climbing a massive crag.

Sep. 13 600pm CIRQUE DU FREAK THE VAMPIRES ASSISTANT The vampire trend continues but the only authentic bloodsuckers in Cirque du Freak are its producers and studio execs. Drawn from the young-adult books by U.K. author Darren Shan Cirque du Freak has F/X creatures teen angst and romance mysterious back stories and a brewing war between beasties. On paper its a perfect formula -- Twilight meets X-Men meets Harry Potter -- but the onscreen result is not the sum of its parts. Cirque du Freak opens in sunny suburbia where bland high-schooler Darren (Chris Massoglia) hangs out with his neer-do-well buddy Steve (Josh Hutcherson). Something wacky this way comes The titular freak show is in town for one night only. The two sneak out to meet the freaks including sardonic spider-tamer Larten (John C. Reilly) whom Steve recognizes from one of his occult books to be a 220-year-old vampire. Soon enough Darren becomes a half-vampire (?) whose new love interest -- a cute girl too insecure to show her monkey tail -- teaches him that ""being human is not about what you are but who you are""; Darren battles the now-evil Steve who is also now-jealous because Darren got to become a vampire; and Willem Dafoe shows up looking like Vincent Price resurrected. Some of you are thinking That sounds rad And Cirque might have worked if it were either straight dark comedy or actually dark like its source material. Directed by Paul Weitz (American Pie) the movie suffers from the same tonal schizophrenia of that other recent goth wannabe Jennifers Body Is it meant to be scary or funny? Oops its neither. (Citywide) (Aaron Hillis)HANNAH FREE In perhaps her biggest role since her work on the iconic 1980s cop show Cagney amp; Lacey Sharon Gless stars as Hannah an elderly woman denied permission to visit her dying lover Rachel (Maureen Gallagher) even though theyre residents of the same nursing home. Hannah and Rachel have been in love for 40 years even during Rachels marriage to a man. In flashbacks Hannah recalls their life together which it must be said isnt terribly interesting. Adapting her play screenwriter Claudia Allen presents each woman in the broadest of strokes -- Hannah is a free spirit obsessed with traveling the world while Rachel is homespun and responsible. Rather quickly the flashbacks become repetitively lovey-dovey; only near the end does Rachel in a fine moment for Gallagher let loose giving Hannah a piece of her mind and the film itself a much needed blast of energy. As directed by Wendy Jo Carlton Hannah Free is as predictable as a Hallmark Channel movie although theres undeniable pleasure to be had from watching Gless mumble and grumble and generally chew the scenery. Cagney lives and shes as cranky as ever. (Music Hall) (Chuck Wilson)THE JANKY PROMOTERS amp; FROM MEXICO WITH LOVE Two films opened unheralded last week at the Beverly Center--and may well be gone by the time you read this. That is whats called ""a contractual release."" It used to be that when a studio changed heads only those unlucky pictures that were produced under the previous regime would be given such a grim reaping a bare-bones ad campaign or none at all; a debut in some dimly lit plex sandwiched between extinct mammoths that once enjoyed the dignity of a fairly promoted first weekend. ""Straight to video"" used to mean forgettable martial arts stars or formerly viable actual stars whose careers were in turnaround or still-sexy ex-flavors of the month condemned to premature afterlives. These days however such bitter fates also greet filmmakers whose audiences are firmly established and wildcatter indies whose efforts in fairer times would at least be given a visible sendoff. Written by and starring Ice Cube and released (nominally) by The Weinstein Company The Janky Promoters is farce in the unpretentious vein of BarbershopBarbershop2FridayNext Fridayand Friday After Next. That is also its problem in hard Darwinian terms. Cube and Mike Epps play a pair of concert-promoting hustlers who in a single 24-hour period are repeatedly busted in their shameless lies by other shameless liars. Despite the music of Young Jeezy (playing himself) and the smoldering menace embodied by a local druglord (an outstanding Darris Love) everything builds to a fairly careless climax. In the theater across the hall FromMexicoWith Lovespins a more tightly constructed yarn from its equally familiar elements imposing the feel-good arc of Rocky (underdog-boxer-with-heart goes the distance against a privileged opponent) upon the gritty well-drawn texture of life among migrant workers along the border near Laredo Texas. Director Jimmy Nickerson was previously a distinguished stunt and fight coordinator (RockyGladiator Fight Club); the boxing here feels enjoyably lived in. Gummy bits of backstory may cling like Post-its to the undersides of the dialogue--we never lose sight that our hero (Kuno Becker excellent) is the son of a dead boxer who could have been one of the greats etc.--but the screenplay (by Glen Hartford and Nicholas Siapkaris) otherwise promotes reliable tension and lumps in ones throat. As villainous father to the spoiled gringo boxer Stephen Lang might easily have been a mere cipher of ill will but instead gives us a man who has painted himself into a corner psychologically--and so is more tormented and dangerous. Are movies as we know them dying that two such generic canaries as these should keel over in the cultural mineshaft? Both would pull you in if you caught them while channel-surfing--The Janky Promoters has good laughs (theres a welcome intrusion by the crew of the reality show Cheaters at one adulterous impasse); and whatever its surface predictabilities From Mexico With Love has the virtue of coaxing you to care about its people. Trouble is neither picture does anything new. Whatever large paradigm shift is transforming motion pictures here are two hapless proofs that economy be damned lack of originality is the silent killer. (F.X. Feeney) MOTHERHOOD Casting against type is one thing but putting Uma Thurman -- an unheralded character actress; the more extraordinary the character the better -- in the role of an unkempt New York City mom goes against the cinematic gods. And the gods are angry at Motherhood writer/director Katherine Dieckmanns ode to the trials of Manhattans downwardly mobile breeding bourgeoisie. Thurman in a scruffy brown wig and dingy housedress has been cursed with a mannered ""comic"" performance and that funky flutey elocution she uses when shes trying to speak like a real person. Thurman plays Eliza the mother of two young children and wife of a hapless editor (Anthony Edwards). Together they live the kind of shabby-groovy life -- ruled by preschool pickups and parking shenanigans -- familiar to half of Brooklyn. Dieckmann nails the look of a certain niche of urban neo-middle class living but the films hyperearnest tone and reliance on ""day-from-hell"" New York cliches overwhelm those details. Eliza formerly known for her ""fiercely lyrical fiction"" wants to win a mommy blog contest because ""nobody talks about this stuff."" Alas the deadline for the contest looms as several major dramas unfold including the organizing of a kiddie birthday party and Elizas swift bloggy betrayal of a fellow moms confidence about using her sons bath toy as a dildo. (Monica 4-Plex; Town Center 5; Playhouse 7) (Michelle Orange)ONG BAK 2 Youre not always entirely sure what is happening in Tony Jaas new movie but there certainly is a lot of it. In this in-name-only sequel the martial-arts maven plays Tien a scion avenging his family in a 15th-century Thailand marked by arcane hybrid fighting styles and a numbing sepia murkiness. Flying-fist connoisseurs may appreciate his journey from training with bandits to battling the warlords who killed his father but the crossover fans tickled by Ong Baks spark and humor will be disappointed here. While Jaa clearly hasnt lost any of his stamina in the six years since starring as a different underdog in the original his first outing as a director is confusing with distractingly muddy storytelling and wildly varying styles from scene to scene. Thrills do come from acrobatic antics with an alligator and on an obliging elephant; a kick fight conducted mostly on the ground; and an engaging assortment of pummeling in a multilevel thatched village. The movie would work better as a highlight reel. While the first Ong Bak replayed shots from a second angle here the gimmick is replaying in slo-mo -- which only calls attention to the films slog. (Sunset 5; Playhouse 7) (Nicolas Rapold)SAW VI If you havent followed the series up until now theres not much point in trying to catch up with the agonized convolutions of the Saw sagas plot line. Somebody tried to explain the plot of Saw III or IV to me once and it took a half-hour -- this film presumably like its predecessors is a bumblefuck involving a serial killer Jigsaw (a thin-lipped Tobin Bell now intoning from beyond the grave) who devises Fear Factor-/Pit and the Pendulum-style deadly dilemmas for his victims. Taken just as an objet dart Saw VI -- gray grisly solemn stupid -- would be about the most dismal thing Ive ever laid eyes on the argument against film preservation. But it vaults into the realm of real detestability through pretensions of relevance having Jigsaw go after faddish bad guys such as usurers made to cut their own pound of flesh and a team of insurance-company employees looking out for the bottom line. Yes Saw VI youre a vehicle for positive social action. Suggested plot for the inevitable Saw VII Jigsaw captures and tortures ""artists"" and studio execs who have money and access to a supple potentially transcendent and ennobling medium but instead make a lot of Saw movies. (Citywide) (Nick Pinkerton) STAN HELSING There is not a single frame of funny in Stan Helsing. A flaccid excruciatingly tedious spoof of contemporary horror films that according to press notes was ""written and directed by one of the guys who brought you Scary Movie"" (said guy is Bo Zenga) SH traffics in wan sight gags lethargic pacing and a plot that can be summed up as ""and then some other lame shit happens. ."" When quipping slacker video-store clerk of the title (Steve Howey) heads out for a night of Halloween partying with his best friend (Kenan Thompson) his ex-girlfriend and a stripper-turned-massage therapist little does he know that before the night is over he will discover he is descended from a legendary monster hunter -- which comes in handy as he and his motley crew do battle with a whos who of horror-flick baddies. What Zenga doesnt half-ass recycle (oh check out the wisecracking black folks talking shit to the video screen as white folks in a horror flick stumble into harms way) he simply fumbles. The generically attractive young cast gamely tries to pump life into the script to no avail. Leslie Nielsen in waitress drag however looks like hed rather be having a colonoscopy. (Mann Chinese 6) (Ernest Hardy)THE STEPFATHER Awkwardly chummy guys with weird glasses who disappear into darkened rooms with your laughing mother to listen to Donald Fagen solo albums -- the stepfather was a ready-to-villainize archetype for the kids-of-divorce who saw the 1987 Terry OQuinn thriller. That Stepfather was Donald Westlakes reworking of Hitchcocks wolf-in-the-suburbs Shadow of a Doubt and now Westlakes screenplay has been rejiggered. The kickoff is good -- the finale effectively literalizes the expression ""broken home"" -- but director Nelson McCormick doesnt keep things ""taut"" in between. Rather than do scenes right the first time he tends to deja vu them (this usually involves Amber Heard wearing not-too-much). Menaced family and friends include a Gossip Girl guy and a bunch of actors who look faintly like other more-famous actors but The Stepfather is finally only as good as its stepfather -- and Dylan Walsh aint bad. Hes nondescriptly handsome in a subdued strong-jaw line L.L. Bean-fashion shortish-as-bullies-will-be and oversensitive and overpolite in a hard-to-pinpoint way. Still comparison with Jaume Collet-Serras recent and superior Orphan -- also about a breached family -- shows the difference between a by-the-numbers journeyman and a serious student of genre. Anyhow closing on a butt-rock cover of ""Happy Together"" should leave em laughing. (Citywide) (Nick Pinkerton)(UNTITLED)(Untitled) aims wide and misses its satire of the contemporary-art scene seemingly lifted from the transcripts of late-80s Senate debates about the NEA. Two highly competitive brothers -- Josh (Eion Bailey) a successful painter of dull hotel art and Adrian (Adam Goldberg who also serves as executive producer) a perpetually indignant brow-furrowing composer of atonal music -- fall for wildly ambitious New York gallerist Madeleine (Marley Shelton). Director Jonathan Parker who co-wrote with Catherine DiNapoli (the duo behind 2001s Bartleby) wants to have it both ways snidely mocking his protagonists and then granting them happy art-affirming endings. Adrian scribbles furiously in his Moleskine Madeleine wears noisy textured clothing (though Sarah Lawrence tees are her preferred sleepwear) and crybaby Josh wonders ""When did beauty become so fuckin ugly?"" Tepid spoofs of Damien Hirst and Charles Ray creations fall flat as finger-wagging proof of contemporary arts aesthetic bankruptcy a Warholian-like aphasic thrown in for more laffs. (Untitled) tries to reignite who-gets-to-call-it-art debates that havent been taken seriously for at least a decade -- which may explain the recurring presence of a plastic bag that appears to have blown in off the set of American Beauty.(The Landmark; Sunset 5; Town Center 5; Playhouse 7) (Melissa Anderson) Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Once upon a time in a far-off land called 1987 there was a B-movie thriller called ""The Stepfather and it was very good smart and witty and scary as hell. That was 22 years ago though and in 2009 there are millions of teenage girls willing to spend their parents money to be scared silly - and not by a movie thats like you know old. Thus this weeks unnecessary remake. As such things go its not bad slick and proficient ""The Stepfather 2.0 gets the adrenaline pumping but the original has the brains.How can you tell the remakes aiming for the ""Gossip Girl crowd? For one thing one of that shows dreamboats Penn Badgley stars as Michael Harding a troubled teen who comes back from military school to discover that mom (Sela Ward) has married a man she hardly knows. The PG-13 rating also promises a far less bloody time than the R-rated original. (To appease the target audiences dates Amber Heard wears as little as humanly possible as Michaels girlfriend. Who knew there were so many backyard swimming pools in Portland Ore.?)Dylan Walsh plays the title character David Harris a squeaky-clean square who only wants a perfect family and is so disappointed when he has to serially murder his latest step-clan and start all over again. Where the first movies Terry OQuinn (now Locke on ""Lost) had a mad merry gleam in his eye this stepfather is all grim business. Walsh deftly plays up the characters generic cheerfulness though; David has adopted so many identities over the years that by now he has none of his own.Under Nelson McCormicks smooth direction ""The Stepfather works up a decent number of eeks but this is still lazy almost Pavlovian moviemaking with a dud new ending and a musical score that pre-announces every scare. Another tip-off to the films target demo almost all the suspense is cellphone-related from dead mens handsets that ring inconveniently to batteries that fall out - OMG - at the worst possible times.""The Stepfather is probably the first movie to use the Google search fields automatic-fill capability as a plot device to generate chills.

Cardone; Release Date Wide 10/16/2009; Runtime (in minutes) 101; MPAA Rating PG-13 Posted October 14 2009 -- 1200 AM EDT Back in 1987 when the embrace of neo-traditional family dynamics had become all the rage among baby boomers The Stepfather was a nifty little Hitchcockian thriller -- a slasher variation on Shadow of a Doubt -- about a psycho who insinuated himself into the lives of divorced mothers married them and began to violently blow his top after he discovered that each new family hed joined couldn?t live up to his ""perfect"" dreams of wholesome domestic bliss. Terry OQuinns performance as this Boy Scout master with a secret piece missing was itchy and twitchy coldly funny and subtle. He set quite a standard though Dylan Walsh (Nip/Tuck) in the new remake of The Stepfather shows a few flashes of that same menacing satirical spirit. Walsh has the aging-choirboy look of a suburban David Keith and he gives the character a snappish smugness. If the original film was like Father Knows Best starring Ted Bundy the new Stepfather emerges from the era of shows like 18 Kids and Counting where the preening heartiness of the Duggar family is presented as a kind of G-rated emotional gold standard for the rest of us to live up to. After moving in with Susan (Sela Ward) and her two sons Walshs stepfather uses his bogusly square caring-dad veneer to oppress anyone who strays from the straight and narrow. The trouble with the movie apart from its rather monotonous dourness of tone is that everyone in the family especially the reformed-delinquent high school son (Penn Badgley) comes off as tougher smarter and quicker on the draw than the stepfather whos supposed to be outfoxing them. As a result although theyre the victims the movie ends up making them look like saps. Theyre enablers?not of an ominous fake father but of too many hamhanded plot mechanics.

The label ""family film"" doesnt quite stick to ""The Stepfather"" helmer Nelson McCormicks virtually bloodless remake of the 1987 horror-thriller that spawned a mini-franchise although it does deal in issues both domestic and psychotic. But the films target aud will likely care less about social subtexts than about why the movies villain comes off as a homicidal Ned Flanders. Sony/Screen Gems release may slay on opening weekend but will succumb to ""Saw VI"" on Oct. 23 after the slasher crowd realizes this stepdad is a far too civilized animal. McCormicks ""Stepfather"" boasts a decent script by J.S. Cardone but it seems to have been made in a bubble as if nothing had transpired in the world of slasher/horror since the late Donald Westlake (""The Grifters"") wrote the much-respected original. In that film a memorable Terry OQuinn played a serial killer pathologically attached to the American Dream Looking for an instant perfect family OQuinns Jerry was always disappointed and moved on to his next brood after killing the last. The setup in the new version is identical David (Dylan Walsh) is seen cutting his hair changing his eye color with contacts and then departing his Salt Lake City subdivision with a wife and three stepkids slaughtered in the dining room. (News reports describe the horror of the crime scene but gore is almost completely absent.) The viewers questions immediately commence If Davids motivation is disappointment -- in his family in the whole suburban dog-and-pony show -- why would he pack up and leave as if hed just performed a contract killing? If youre going to make a psychological thriller give us some psychology. Although intelligently shot by Patrick Cady and well edited by Eric L. Beason the film continues to raise irksome questions of motive Susan Harding (Sela Ward) recently divorced from Jay (a solid Jon Tenney) is apparently desperate enough to be picked up in a supermarket by David whose charms are elusive if not absent. Shes presented as savvy; he destroys that notion. Regardless Susan takes him out and brings him home and six months later her once-troubled son Michael (Penn Badgley ""Gossip Girl"") returns from military school to find this very suspicious character sleeping with his mother blathering on about the importance of family and looming in the doorway every time someone turns around. The cast is uniformly good even if the edges of their characters dont quite interlock. Badgley like a taller better-looking Elijah Wood is thoroughly convincing as a son who would normally be territorial under the circumstances but whos trying to atone for a dubious youth. As his girlfriend Kelly Amber Heard is utterly natural though kept (as usual) in a state of semi-undress. Paige Turco has a nice bit as a suspicious friend who makes the mistake of crossing Davids path. Its Walsh whos the wild card here playing David as a nerdy psychopath and not one whos thought things out particularly well He tells lazy lies and as soon as his cover starts to get blown he kills someone -- again not with much guile considering how many impromptu families hes presumably put together and taken apart. For all its easy dialogue Cardones script doesnt really give us an inkling of whether Davids career as a killer goes back much beyond Salt Lake City. And its hard to get absorbed in a story with so many unresolved issues. Production values are topnotch.
