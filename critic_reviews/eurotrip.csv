Both had me chortling - but only one was meant to. Whatever else Eurotrip is good value for money seemingly for producers as well as punters since scenes set in locations as diverse as Ohio London and surreally Slovakia were all filmed in the Czech Republic. Inspired by the striking idea that America was founded by prudes appalled by all the crazy European sex were having our American friends set out having more in common with Houellebecqian sex tourists than the Jamesian innocents of Le Divorce. Condemned to repeat their forebears rejection of Catholic Europe they end the film humiliating the pope himself. This is the National Lampoon Griswold saga continued by other means. Not for the faint-hearted.

As the story moves on you learn more about the characters and it ends up a pretty funny tour of Europe in all the places youd expect oh and Bratislava LOL in each one some sort of strange unfortunate event happens providing some great moments of laughter. The main cast are pretty much unknown but there are some random faces you might know like Matt Damon and Vinnie Jones having small roles but its refreshing to see the bigger actors take a back seat. I dont think I would recommend this film to those are easily offended with catholics Germans and basically the whole of Eastern Europe with it being the poorer looking part gettting a few jibes but nothing sinister Id recommend this film in a heartbeat much better than other teen movies and well worth the watch I am actually shocked it wasnt bigger and more popular Only thing you wont like is the annoyingly catchy theme song that crops up every now and again I have been singing it for days now....

"Tasteless Eurotrip Doesnt Travel Well washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Tasteless Eurotrip Doesnt Travel Well Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 20 2004 If youre going to make a gross-out comedy you cant just be gross. Youve got to be to be funny as well or the movie will be DOA. Which is why ""Eurotrip"" should be toe-tagged and shoved into the deepest and coldest of video vaults. An uninspired and cheesy attempt to reprise the camaraderie and bawdy spirit of films like ""Road Trip"" or ""American Pie"" its one prolonged torture session in the flickering darkness. There are jails in Guatemala resonating with more chuckles than this. This movies only dramatic dilemma is this Should you cringe first at its painful mediocrity or the storys half-baked tastelessness? Some other things you might mull over while sitting through ""Eurotrip"" Are you close enough to the aisle to escape without attention? Have you called your dentist lately for a cleaning? What is the sound of one hand not clapping? Scotty Thomas (Scott Mechlowicz) has been exchanging enjoyable e-mail messages with a German pen pal for years. Amazingly hes never found out that ""Mike"" -- as he calls his Berlin pal -- is not a guy but a gal. Her name is Mieke which doesnt sound or even look like Mike. After corresponding with someone for years he doesnt know the persons gender? Audience meet your central character. When Mieke (Jessica Boehrs) sends a come-hither message to Scotty he panics. Assuming this was a gay overture he tells her never to message him again. Too late he discovers Miekes true identity -- Ive already forgotten how -- and realizes she may be the girl of his dreams. But shes so upset she has e-blocked him for good. He decides to fly to Berlin to make amends and win her back. His best friend Cooper (Jacob Pitts) comes along for the ride. And two other friends planning to go to Europe -- twins Jenny (Michelle Trachtenberg) and Jamie (Travis Wester) -- promise to meet up. Unable to afford a flight Scotty and Cooper sign up as air couriers. This takes them to London where they run into a group of unruly Manchester United soccer hooligans led by English screen heavy Vinnie Jones who has fallen a long way since his memorable appearances in ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch."" (Pardon me for being a soccer fan but why would a group of fans from a northern English region speak in London-area accents unless they were the so-called Cockney Red variety of Man U. fan? And why would they be wearing shirts that bear no resemblance to their club colors? Just curious.) After an embarrassing run-through of every held cliche about ""soccer hooligans"" the ""story"" takes us to the Continent where our foursome now reunited burn an Ugly American path through Europe. Debuting director Jeff Schaffer and writers Alec Berg and David Mandel -- the three coughed up the hairball that became ""The Cat in the Hat"" -- are clearly trying to offend every European on the planet with all the stereotypes they can muster. This could be deliciously funny in the hands of a greater trio. If you want to use stereotypes the filmmakers display the imagination of say middle-school rednecks throwing beer bottles in a 7-Eleven parking lot. Thus our friends run afoul of an Samp;M sex club in Amsterdam trudge through trash-filled streets in Eastern Europe and encounter a German boy sporting a painted Hitler mustache in Berlin. And in Rome (where Scotty is pursuing the ever-elusive Mieke) they run riot inside the Vatican during which time Scotty accidentally pulls the bell that is supposed to signal the demise of the pope. And the less said about a Matt Damon cameo the better. Funny? Too bad someone already used the title ""Dumb amp; Dumberer."" Eurotrip (92 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for sexuality nudity obscenity and drug and alcohol use.

Ditto for teen sex comedies. But put the two together in Eurotrip and the tired conventions seem fresher than they have any right to be. What distinguishes this movie from the Road Trip/American Pie school of predictability is a handful of scenarios that feel comically original. When in Rome er somewhere in France the Eurotrip boys go au naturel. DreamWorks Youll find plenty of dirty jokes and sexual innuendo bathroom humor and nudity. But mixed with the sleaze is the unexpected and occasionally inspired. The cast is largely unknown but there are some notable cameos. Matt Damon has a funny bit as the pierced and shaved lead singer of a Smashing Pumpkins-style band. Lucy Lawless guests as a dominatrix whose disciplinary methods reach new lows. Larry Sanders Show alum Jeffrey Tambor plays the clueless dad of the affable Scotty (Scott Mechlowicz) around whom the movie revolves. About the show Eurotrip 1/2 (out of four) StarsScott Mechlowicz Michelle Trachtenberg Jacob Pitts Travis Wester Director Jeff Schaffer Distributor DreamWorks Rating R for sexuality nudity language and drug/alcohol content Opens nationwide Friday Upon graduating from high school Scotty is dumped by his girlfriend. He becomes a laughing stock his cuckolding commemorated in a catchy rock anthem by Damons band. Scotty plans to spend his summer in his usual responsible way taking a job and preparing for college. But when he realizes that his German cyber pen pal whom he took for a guy is actually a blond babe he flies to Europe to apologize. Hes accompanied by his best friend a sex-obsessed joker (Jacob Pitts) and a pair of bookish twins played by Michelle Trachtenberg and Travis Wester. Raucous adventures and mayhem follow. Before hooking up with his e-mail flame Scotty and pals spend time in London in the company of soccer hooligans; in Paris where Scotty has a strange duel with a gilded mime; and in war-ravaged Bratislava where the four sample the good life in a luxurious hotel for a dollar and change. True these young Americans fall into the category of ugly but the kids silly antics generate genuine laughs. And thats something to write home about.

A bunch of American stereotypes go to Europe where they meet a bunch of European stereotypes -- the molesting Italian the French mime the British soccer hooligan -- and theres much sex and drugs and insipid behavior. Party. Yet ""Eurotrip"" isnt awful. At times its even funny. Most recent raunchy comedies trailing forever after the Farrelly brothers try to be outrageous with the worst kinds of bathroom humor. Look Poop Funny Movie review Showtimes and trailer  ""Eurotrip"" with Scott Mechlowicz Michelle Trachtenberg Jacob Pitts Travis Wester. Directed by Jeff Schaffer. Written by Schaffer Alec Berg and David Mandel. 92 minutes. Rated R for sexuality nudity language and drug/alcohol content. Several theaters. ""Eurotrips"" outrageousness is less scatological -- like when they take the concept of the dumped boyfriend to new heights. On the day Scotty (Scott Mechlowicz) graduates from high school his girlfriend Fiona (""Smallvilles"" Kristin Kreuk the first of many cameos) coldly dumps him while his obtuse parents proudly videotape the episode. To forget her Scotty attends a graduation party where a punk bands lead singer (cameo Matt Damon) dedicates their next song to you guessed it Fiona who promptly jumps onstage to French-kiss him. The song is all about having sex with Fiona behind her boyfriends back. Its called ""Scotty Doesnt Know."" Everyone sings along while he stands in the crowd stunned. His best friend ""This band rocks"" Now thats pretty funny. Another example? Theres not only Tamp;A in the film but P. The male P. True the female nudity is young and nubile while the male version tends toward middle-age and elderly but full-frontal male nudity in a mainstream American picture? Distributed in the U.S.? Astonishing. Many of the outrageous jokes (a goose-stepping German child) fall flat; Scottys backpacking friends are like junior versions of sitcom actors David Spade and David Hyde Pierce (the sly horny one; the anal-retentive one); and the film is often shallow and predictable. But its not painfully stupid in a ""Just Married"" kind of way. And the film definitely hits its target audience. ""This is so wrong"" a teenager sitting next to me at the screening said. Happily.

Starring Marina Golbahari Arif Herati. Directed and written by Siddiq Barmak. (PG-13. 82 minutes. In Dari with English subtitles. At the Lumiere and Cinedome in Fremont).. Life for women under Taliban rule offered no prospect of happiness just degrees of misery. Faced with zero economic opportunity the 12-year-old heroine of ""Osama"" poses as a boy out of pure necessity not boldness. It is with great sympathy and even greater pragmatism that filmmaker Siddiq Barmak presents this heartbreaking powerful drama inspired by a real- life cross-dressing girl. The first film made in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban ""Osama"" indicts the former extremist government by portraying oppression as part of the fabric of everyday life. The horrors of ""Osama"" are pervasive not acute so they take longer to sink in. But once in they stay there. Barmak opens with a sea of blue burqas -- women protesting their inability to hold jobs or leave their homes unchaperoned. Government agents respond to the peaceful protest by blasting the women with water hoses further dehumanizing them. Women widowed by the many Afghan wars have no options. When the preteen girl (Marina Golbahari) and her single mother lose their hospital jobs they have no means of feeding themselves. The plan hatched by the girls mother and grandmother is not elaborate. They cut her hair outfit her in a boys robe and send her into the world. Young Golbahari is affectless -- hauntingly so -- as the girl now renamed Osama. The fear and confusion clouding Golbaharis gamine face seem genuine; this kid doesnt appear to be equipped for major deception. Osamas high voice provokes suspicion at her Taliban boys school though an orphan boy (played with streetwise elan by Arif Herati) tries to protect her. He urges the girl to stay cool and not give herself away but she cant help shrieking after she climbs a tree and cant get down. When Osama is suspended over a well as punishment the girl emits agonizing cries for her mother. Barmak injects lyricism into the picture in small but highly evocative doses. We see from the girls point of view her barely formed views of the two genders. The thought of womanhood brings an image of those soaked female protesters but the male vision is of herself face uncovered and skipping rope before a cluster of women in burqas. But men and boys were tormented by the Taliban as well. In ""Osama"" men live under constant fear of reprisal when they are not being called upon to fight wars. The orphan boy is risking his freedom by assisting Osama as is a shopkeeper who briefly employs the girl. Life under the Taliban it seems was good only for the Taliban. -- Advisory This film contains violence adult situations. EUROTRIP Comedy.

An unbilled Matt Damon shows up as a punk rocker in ""Eurotrip."" He provides the freshest moment in this pedestrian teen-sex travelogue -- and he appears before anyone ever crosses the Pond. Damons tattooed singer gloats about snagging recent high school grad Scotts (Scott Mechlowicz) girlfriend. His song ""Scotty Doesnt Know"" becomes a running joke worth a few chuckles as it follows Scott through Europe on the radio and in a nightclub dance remix. Scott and his buddies want to track down his German pen pal Mieke whom he has just discovered is a girl (he thought her name was pronounced ""Mike""). The gang hits tourist favorites like Big Ben and the Louvre while the script written by Jeff Schaffer Alec Berg and David Mandel (the team behind the dreadful ""The Cat in the Hat"") taps every European cliche. Theres a sleazy Italian a tiny Hitler aficionado English football hooligans and an ugly American who picks up his free T-shirt from the Amsterdam sex club where hes just been defiled. The winning young cast buoys the film for stretches. Newcomer Mechlowiczs regular-guy handsomeness makes him believable as a romantic lead and as the butt of his pals jokes. Mechlowicz shows a flair for physical comedy when his character duels with a ""robot"" sidewalk performer outside the Louvre mimicking the guys cheesy maneuvers and hydraulic voice effects. As the tourist armed with an expensive camera and chained to his Frommers guide (a constant plug) Travis Wester makes a likable stiff. Michelle Trachtenberg (from TVs ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"") as his twin sister is a bit too careful in her appearance to be plausible as just one of the guys. Her character is supposed to be so dudelike that the boys forget shes a girl. When shes looking for a rich European playboy one of the boys tells her that sounds gay. That brings us to a very prominent theme in ""Eurotrip"" gay jokes. The Italian molests the boys on the train and Scott is warned (when he thinks Mieke is a man) that the German is out to kidnap him. Teen sex comedies always have more homoerotic moments than you can shake a ... whatever ... at but ""Eurotrip"" seems overly concerned with penises and predatory men. This brand of humor a time-honored crutch for comedy writers is both lazy and unseemly. -- Advisory This film contains nudity sexual situations. -- KITCHEN STORIES Comedy. Starring Tomas Norstrom Joachim Calmeyer. Directed by Bent Hamer. Written by Hamer and Jorgen Bergmark. (Not rated. 95 minutes. In Norwegian with English subtitles. At the Opera Plaza Act theaters in Berkeley and the Rafael).. Scientific observation takes patience and intense focus. So does ""Kitchen Stories"" a Norwegian comedy that lacks an engine for its first 30 minutes. The film pays off eventually with a lovely story of friendship between two lonely men. Filmmaker Bent Hamer whose name suggests satire as a birthright based ""Kitchen Stories"" on postwar domestic studies in Scandinavia. Out to devise more efficient kitchens researchers observed 1950s homemakers performing daily tasks. The studies were conducted by an outfit called the Swedish Home Research Institute by the way and not by Ikea. ""Kitchen Stories"" imagines that these studies were instead performed on older bachelors. The films laboratory subject is Isak (Joachim Calmeyer) a Norwegian farmer of questionable hygiene who volunteered for the study because he thought it came with a free horse (it does but its a figurine). The Swedish researcher (Tomas Norstrom) assigned to Isak is so set in his ways that he is nauseated by having to drive on the right side instead of the left in Norway. The farmer is hardly a comfort cooking in his bedroom instead of the kitchen so the researcher cant do his job. That sums up the action in the first third of the film which is also short on dialogue. The researcher is forbidden to interact with the farmer whom he regards from a ridiculously high chair in the kitchens corner. (Dressed in a suit the researcher looks like an umpire at Wimbledon.) The visual gags alleviate the boredom of the first part of the film then the actors give the story its juice. Calmeyer lends a quiet glee to a scene where the farmer spies on the intruder via a hole hes drilled through a floor. As the staid researcher Norstrom turns the act of borrowing Isaks salt shaker into something illicit. The no-contact rules actually help the two reserved men start a friendship freeing them of the burden of small talk in getting acquainted. After several silent days the researcher notices that the farmers pipe is empty and tosses him a bag of tobacco. Isak responds with his first words ""Its time for coffee."" Once these two realize that theres an antidote to solitude they delight in their friendship and dismay the researchers boss. Norstrom loosens his expressions as it dawns on the researcher that life isnt all drudgery. But Calmeyer goes deeper portraying the farmer as a man who long ago shut the door on joy only to see it pried open by a Swede bearing a toy horse.

"Eurotrip travels in familiar teen-sex territory - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Eurotrip travels in familiar teen-sex territory By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  February 20 2004 In light of our recent crackdown on runaway nudity the steady stream of exposed breasts in the gnarly ""Eurotrip"" give it a nostalgic feel. When one randy guy lands himself in a hot tub and talks a girl into removing her bikini top it feels like 2003 all over again.Raunchy teen comedies meanwhile never go away long enough to miss them properly. ""Eurotrip"" has allegedly been brought by the producers behind 2000s ""Road Trip"" and last years ""Old School"" and its a credible if runty addition to the family.Those two movies were absurd circuses of male hormones and identifiable universes where college kids were eager to grow up and the grown-ups were depressed that they had. The makers of those films Todd Phillips and Scot Armstrong skipped a third episode and made the upcoming ""Starsky and Hutch"" instead. Its just as well ""Eurotrip"" is just ""Road Trip"" with a ratty passport.The gears of the plot remain unchanged and unpolished Boy drags three friends on long-distance quest for girl. The wrinkle here is the discovery by Scotty (Scott Mechlowicz) that the affectionate German pen pal whom he spurns for being a dude is actually a chick. So Scotty and his sex-crazed pal Cooper (Jacob Pitts) agree to spend their last summer before college making their way to Berlin to win back the lass (Jessica Boehrs).Each of the gawky boys in this movie seems very far from any sort of manhood. They dont even seem bound for the 10th grade let alone college. Cooper who looks and thinks like a young mangy David Spade actually has the poignant ancestral goal of rekindling his European sexual heritage. As far as hes concerned America was founded by prudes and all the repressions got him down. (This might be the first teen comedy to suggest that the house that the Paris Hilton sex tape and the Coors Light twins built is not a home.)""Eurotrip"" which appears to be disillusioned with how juvenile and teasing American notions of sex can be celebrates its R-rating like a kid on his 21st birthday. It ups the physical-contact ante enough for you to forget that some of its writers are the nincompoops who loaded ""The Cat in the Hat"" with sex jokes.In Paris Scotty and Cooper meet up with their sibling pals Jenny (Michelle Trachtenberg) and Jamie (Travis Wester) whom Cooper describes as ""the worst twins ever."" In Amsterdam uptight Jamie gets lucky (and robbed) in a dark alley while Cooper (always Cooper) is treated to the whims of Lucy Lawless in an Samp;M parlor called Club VanDerSexxx. The Europe these kids discover is a pop-up book consistent only with other peoples exaggerations of trips taken when they were 18.Scotty and Cooper run into Vinnie Jones leading a bunch of crazed soccer hooligans whom they tame with a singalong to an old Sheena Easton chestnut. (Its a welcome antidote to the soundtracks pimple rock.) Theres also a nice mime-off between Scotty and a Parisian (J.P. Manoux) in silver body paint some naughty stuff at the Vatican and a hilarious flagrant assault on the Eastern European outlook namely Bratislavas. There apparently 1.83 gets you the royal P-Diddy treatment.The movie couldve lived without the molesting Italian (Fred Armisen) and it wouldve been stronger with more than one fully developed female character. It even offers scores of male frontal nudes in a beach scene that turns into a riff on zombie movies. Its in keeping with the movies cheerful homophobia and its sunny misogyny. Still ""Eurotrip"" is sort of admirable Unlike its peers its tired of talking about sex and is ready to have some.(""Eurotrip"" 1/2) Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

"Eurotrip | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; eurotrip ) Eurotrip (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli It boggles the mind to consider that the fertile writing team of Alec Berg David Mandel and Jeff Schaffer all of whom spent time scripting episodes of ""Seinfeld"" could turn out something as abysmally unfunny as Eurotrip. Then again these guys were also responsible for The Cat in the Hat so perhaps its not all that surprising. At any rate in the genre of teen sex films Eurotrip doesnt set a new standard for lack of quality but it comes close. The problem isnt that it spends 90 minutes marinating in lewdness and bad taste - those things are mandatory for this kind of movie - but that so many of the desperate jabs at humor fail to find their mark. Sex comedies need two obvious ingredients sex and comedy. Eurotrip has some of the former (plenty of bare breasts and buns) but almost none of the latter. The strange thing about watching this movie is that you can see the things that are supposed to be funny and they arent. Every joke is carefully telegraphed but the punch lines are strangely punchless. There are two solid laughs (one occurs at the expense of David Hasselhoff and the other is during the end credit outtakes) and a couple of mild chuckles. The film also doesnt understand the concept of overplaying a joke. Instead of moving along to the next bit of would-be humor Eurotrip lingers on gags that arent especially funny to begin with until they become tiresome. (The ""robot battle"" is a prime example.) The premise got me thinking which is a bad sign for a movie where thought is one of the least desirable activities for a human being to engage in. Eurotrip opens by introducing us to the protagonist Scott Thomas (Scott Mechlowicz who appears to have learned acting by studying Hayden Christensens interpretation of Anakin Skywalker) a high school senior who has been corresponding for some time with his electronic pen pal a German named Mieke (Jessica Boehrs). Somehow however despite having engaged in numerous lengthy e-mail discussions and even possessing a picture of Mieke Scott doesnt realize hes a she. Sorry to say but even in a genre where believability is frequently stretched way beyond the breaking point in the service of humor this is extreme. So from the beginning rather than identifying with Scott we view him with disdain. How could anyone be so stupid??? Eventually Scott ends up traveling all over Europe chasing his beautiful blond would-be soulmate. (Actually what hes after isnt that ethereal - one would think he could get it elsewhere with a lot less hassle.) Accompanying him is Cooper (Jacob Pitts) a guy who looks (and acts) astonishingly like a young David Spade. In Paris the hormone-driven pair meets up with a couple of friends tomboy Jenny (Michelle Trachtenberg Harriet the Spy all grown up) and her twin brother anal Jamie (Travis Wester). Now a quartet they head for Rome with stops along the way in Amsterdam (for hash-brownies and wild sex) Bratislava (for Eastern European hospitality) and Berlin. Along the way we get cameos from the likes of Matt Damon Vinnie Jones and Lucy Lawless. For a movie with so many off-color elements including (but not limited to) a creepy homosexual predator a scary-looking anal probe dozens of ugly men doing the full Monty sex in a confessional a child lampooning Hitler and Pope bashing (good thing the Catholic Church is too busy gearing up for the release of The Passion of the Christ to have time to complain) Eurotrip comes across as surprisingly tame. It doesnt have the outrageous verve displayed by the likes of American Pie and Road Trip. The lead characters progressive stupidity makes him infinitely less likable. Eurotrip is stale and showing signs of putrefaction - an unwholesome cross between National Lampoons European Vacation and Freddy Got Fingered (without Tom Green and animal masturbation).

Promising young cast flounders amid comic material thats staler than week-old bread. Drop-off should be sharp followed by a long ancillary afterlife. Billed as ""from the producers of Road Trip and Old School"" but lacking the antic sensibility of director Todd Phillips ""Eurotrip"" is an instantly forgettable transplanting of ""Road Trip"" to overseas locales. Promising young cast flounders amid comic material thats staler than week-old bread. Ad campaign pitched at college-age auds and the lack of any similar fare in the marketplace may lead to an initial burst of B.O. But drop-off should be sharp and quick followed by a long ancillary afterlife. Young Scotty Thomas (Scott Mechlowicz) life is quickly going from bad to worse. In the midst of his high school graduation his girlfriend tells him that shes leaving him for another guy because hes ""too predictable."" Then at a post-graduation party Scotty discovers his exs new beau is the heavily pierced-and-tattooed lead singer (an almost unrecognizable Matt Damon) of a punk rock band whose latest song is entitled ""Scotty Doesnt Know."" But the icing on the cake comes when a drunk Scotty abruptly breaks off contact with his German e-mail pen pal Mieke believing Mieke has made a homosexual pass at him. Turns out Mieke isnt another guy as Scott thought but rather a really gorgeous girl (German pop star Jessica Boehrs making her film debut) Inconsolable over the error Scotty decides to ditch his summer job and head for Berlin with vaguely goofy pal Cooper (Jacob Pitts) to find Mieke and beg for her forgiveness. But when these intrepid travelers find out theyll have to wait a full week to travel to Berlin they opt instead for an immediate flight to London. Once in Europe duo meets up with two other friends anal-retentive brother Jamie (Travis Webster) and sexy sister Jenny (Michelle Trachtenberg) who are also spending the summer overseas. And the rest of ""Eurotrip"" is devoted to the now-foursomes increasingly wayward efforts to make it to Berlin bouncing from one European city to the next. Instead of the carefully escalating farce of ""Road Trip"" (or of ""National Lampoons European Vacation"" which remains the absurd high-water mark for this type of pic) writer-director Jeff Schaffer and his co-writers Alec Berg and David Mandel fall back on a parade of broad one-note potshots at various nationalities most of which wouldnt pass muster at a comedy club amateur night. Schafer Berg and Mandel conceive situations that seem to spring from Americans most provincial notions of traveling abroad. To cite just two weary examples In Paris Scotty has a violent encounter with a silver-faced mime; and in Amsterdam Cooper finds himself at the hands of a sex-club dominatrix (Lucy Lawless). Pics most (and perhaps only) inspired sequence involves an Italian train passenger (""Saturday Night Lives"" Fred Armisen fittingly billed as Creepy Italian Guy) who has a tendency to get a little too friendly with his neighbors whenever the train passes through a tunnel. But this gag is so subsequently overplayed that even viewers whove only seen the ""Eurotrip"" trailers may already have tired of it. Pics four leads have an easygoing natural chemistry together but needed a smarter script. In particular Mechlowicz shows real star quality in his second major lead role (following his acclaimed and radically different turn in Sundance entrant ""Mean Creek""). Tech aspects are adequate with Oscar-winning production designer Allan Starski (""Schindlers List"") trying his best to disguise the city of Prague (where pic was almost entirely shot) as a variety of familiar Western European locales.
