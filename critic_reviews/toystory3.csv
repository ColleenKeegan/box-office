Its irresistible conceit and snappy good humor remain largely intact though now it also hauls a saltier and more anxious sensibility. Inanimate figurines dont age but they do get nicked up and discarded and that tension between immortality and irrelevance remains the central conflict in Lee Unkrichs Toy Story 3.Andy is all grown up and about to drive off to college leaving the fate of his toys uncertain. Will they be stored in the attic left on the curb for sanitation pickup or delivered to the local day-care center? All of the above it turns out as the whole gang gets caught in an odyssey of compounded indignities. Fears of the unknown of neglect and abuse are gradually eclipsed by the threat of disposal. Identifying with plastic figures has always been essential to the series playfully perverse aptly adolescent allure but here that empathy mutates into macabre existentialist dread. How many kids movies lead their protagonists to the precipice of a flaming pit of hell?As in TS2 this sequel begins with a flashy blockbuster parody prologue replete with Troll doll hostages and a mushroom cloud of blood-red monkeys before its revealed that the carnage was all born of young Andys imagination. Fast-forward to the present where Andy has matured into a lanky sensitive young adult (you can trace Pixars animation development on the progressively less-dead-eyed faces of the series humans). While Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) was the favored playmate in TS2 Andy chooses old pal Woody (Tom Hanks) as his college companion. But before he can depart Woody tries to save his scorned pals from Sunnyside Daycare initially presented as a heavenly vision of constant grateful play and communal living. Alas their utopia turns out to be a veritable penal colony presided over by a despotic pink huggybear called Lotso (Ned Beatty) and his two henchmen a lumbering lazy-eyed baby doll and Barbies swishy soul mate Ken (Michael Keaton). After suffering the abuses of rough-housing toddlers the group embarks on an extended inspired prison break made possible by Buzzs daredevilry and Mr. Potato Heads reconstitution as a floppy tortilla. Yet danger persists beyond the bounds of day care.Consistent with the advanced maturation of kid culture this 21st-century childrens story features faster louder more intense action saucier sexual innuendos (""Nice as-cot"" is how Barbie greets Ken) more romantic pairings than Loves Labours Lost (do toys really need life partners?) and escalating evocations of death. From cardboard-box coffins and pulverizing machinery to the aforementioned fiery pit--which our heroes approach with solemn hand-holding resignation--this might be Disneys most morbid family movie since The Black Holes grim voyage to nothingness in 79.TS3 like its predecessors is a clever engrossing adventure and like any sequel it tries to balance continuity with novelty the latter provided by a cadre of shiny new characters (led by a plush-toy improv troupe) in superfluous 3-D. Pixar has always wedded technological innovation to classic storytelling and despite some unwelcome steps toward snarky Shrekification this latest film still manages to bulls-eye the primal emotions that resonate with children of all ages. When teenaged Andy plops down on the grass to share his old toys with a shy little girl the film spikes with sadness and layered pleasure--a concise deeply wise expression of the ephemeral that feels real and yet utterly transporting.

"Toy Story 3 knocks it out of the playbox - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon LinkedIn Toy Story 3 knocks it out of the playboxBy Tom Charity Special to CNN In ""Toy Story 3"" Woody and Buzz Lightyear leave Andys house for Sunnyside Daycare. STORY HIGHLIGHTSThe original ""Toy Story"" started Pixars remarkable run 15 years agoIn the film Woody and Buzzs owner Andy is 17 now and moving on to college""Toy Story 3"" is likely to be the most hilarious and heartfelt blockbuster all summer RELATED TOPICS Pixar Animation Studios Movie Reviews Entertainment (CNN) -- How should a tortilla move? Trust Pixar to ask the important questions and to come up with the most inspired answers too. Unsteadily at first in a floppy folding undulating furl on detachable legs accustomed to the rotund corporeal bulk of Mr. Potato Head (the potato being indisposed at the time). Nobody speaks body language more eloquently than Pixar. In another inspired touch space ranger toy Buzz Lightyear is inadvertently rebooted for the Hispanic market. Not only does he switch to fluent Spanish he accompanies his newly ardent protestations of love to cowgirl Jessie with flamboyant flamenco finger clicks and swiveling hips. Hes an intergalactic toreador of love. Nifty moves are one thing but everybody knows that by the second sequel -- or ""threequel"" if you prefer -- even the strongest film franchise is venturing onto shaky ground. (Not to say there arent exceptions.) But in any case conventional wisdom never seems to apply to Pixar the digital animation giant that only ever seems to produce winners ""WALL-E"" ""Cars"" ""Up"" and ""Monsters Inc."" to name just a few. It was ""Toy Story"" that started Pixars remarkable run 15 years ago but the angsty devotion of Andys cowboy doll and his friends (a slinky dog a cowardly T Rex and a piggy bank named Hamm among them) as they await their inevitable retirement remains as poignant today as it did then. Maybe more so now that a generation of kids have grown up with these characters and in some cases probably have grown out of them. iReport Kids review ""Toy Story 3"" In ""Toy Story 3"" Woody and Buzz (voiced by Tom Hanks and Tim Allen as always) remain unchanged as good as new in fact but their owner Andy is 17 now and moving on to college. His mom wants his room cleared and a misunderstanding consigns the toys to Sunnyside Daycare. Initially the idea of all-day play seems too good to be true but Sunnyside has a dark side its ""a place of ruin and despair"" a pre-kindie pastel-colored gulag presided over by Lotso (Ned Beatty) an avuncular pink teddy bear who smells of strawberries (so were told the movie is discreetly 3D but not in smell-o-vision). Its at this point that a slow-starting story hits its stride. Loveable huggable Lotso makes a terrifically malignant bad guy a tin-pot dictator whose loathsome lackeys include a baby with a beady eye and a head capable of 360 degree rotations right out of ""The Exorcist""; a scary cymbal monkey who doubles as an alarm system; and -- yuck -- a Ken doll. Lotsos wicked plan? To confine the new guys to the toddler room a charnel house of free play just a short hop from the landfill. A great escape movie ""Toy Story 3"" funnels the series abiding separation anxiety into a succession of ingenious feints and evasions climaxing in an apocalyptic vision of the gaping inferno. Thrilling enough to goose smaller kids the film is more likely to give sleepless nights to their parents. After all its the older folk who are left behind like Woody when the kids head off to college. So now youre abandoned and redundant wondering whether its OK to go see the latest Pixar without a youngster in hand. Yes its OK; you owe it to yourself. I seriously doubt there will be a more hilarious and heartfelt blockbuster all summer.

Other than a bit of stuffing seeping from a split seam at one leg he seemed in the pink/""gt;pink. Well not quite in the pink/""gt;pink -- his matted fur is now a dingy gray. Holding this faded version of Mr. Bunny again made me both happy and sad. It was the same mix of emotions I felt watching ""Toy Story 3"" the latest installment of the animated series that so dazzlingly launched Pixar when the first ""Toy Story"" arrived 15 years ago. Thats the key to the best of Pixars films -- the movies can put the adult you in touch with your inner child even as you view the emotions evoked with a grown-up clarity. As a child ones reactions to most things are simple. Happy. Sad. Mad. Meltdown. Or as my nephew once memorably complained when he was 3 ""I not happy"" As an adult our emotions become more complex as our concerns extend beyond the next meal and just ourselves to jobs family finances world affairs etc. We come to understand that we can -- and frequently do -- experience multiple emotions simultaneously that it is possible to laugh and cry at the same time. Just ask anyone who has been to a memorial service where the humorously endearing antics and personality quirks of the recently departed were recalled. When a Pixar film fires on all cylinders it gets to you in exactly the same way. Consider the miraculous silent montage in last years ""Up"" which showed the decades-long arc of the elderly male heros marriage. If you werent smiling through tears while watching that your heart is made of solid granite. Pixar movies have offered plenty of other similar evocative moments through the years moments of pitch-perfect emotional distillation a fish fathers panic at losing his son in 2003s ""Finding Nemo""; parents rediscovering their superhero purpose in 2004s ""The Incredibles""; and cowboy toy hero Woodys unwavering love for Andy his owner in any of the ""Toy Story"" films. ""Toy Story 3"" is about what happens to toys -- specifically Woody spaceman Buzz Lightyear cowgirl Jessie and the rest of the familiar gang -- when Andy outgrows them. Do they remain loyal to Andy and wait in a box in the attic for the day when he returns from college and maybe unpacks them or do they find new lives for themselves and transfer their loyalties to new pipsqueak wholl play with them? It never quite reaches the heights of the first ""Toy Story"" or its even better 1999 sequel. The story isnt as fresh and some of the emotions feel recycled. But its still more inventive clever and laugh-out-loud funny than any other movie out there now. Really. And ""3"" finds its heart as its various threads come together in the final 20 minutes when the toys -- spoiler alert -- survive a harrowing journey through a landfill are rescued by a literal dues ex machina and learn that life is about change and moving on even as one treasures ones memories of the past. The ending is bittersweet. It left the 7-year old sitting next to me bereft. ""But I dont want to give away my toys ever"" she wailed through her tears. Adults will have a more complicated reaction. Many will tear up (OK I did) knowing that the toys finding a new owner is indeed a happy ending but being sad that Andy has to grow up. Inevitably though we all grow up and outgrow our playthings. We discover that there are real villains in the world not just ones made of plastic and that the would-be fleshly versions of Woody and Buzz Lightyear cant save or fix everything. It is the wonder of Pixar films that they recognize and put us in touch with that duality that inside the hardened adult most of us have become lurks that still innocent child and we long to get back to that more uncomplicated time even as we know its impossible. Mr. Bunny is still Mr. Bunny and hes waiting for me in his box. I guess maybe it really is time for me to give him away. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

But like the best childrens stories theyre also about something seriously scary the separation anxiety with which all kids (and plenty of adults) are familiar and the spectre of its extreme extrapolation total abandonment. It doesnt take a sociologist to work out why such themes might strike a chord at a time when family life is so fragile for so many; the Toy Story cycle broaches the subject with an emotional honesty that allows young viewers to exercise those anxieties in safety - even if it stops short of the kind of traumatic wallop associated with say Bambis mum. This third outing finds the gang - Woody the cowboy (voiced by Tom Hanks) space ranger Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) cowgirl Jessie (Joan Cusack) timid dinosaur Rex (Wallace Shawn) and various other dog pig and potato-based playthings - facing the reality of their long-indifferent owner leaving for college. The toys fear indefinite leave in the attic or - worse - the trash; the middle ground is relocation to Sunnyside a day-care centre where perhaps they can serve new owners. All seems well on their arrival - sweet kids welcoming new toys - but jeopardy is of course around the corner.The film is in 3D but hang-gliding escapades notwithstanding in-your-face effects take a back seat to more subtle applications such as environmental immersion mock-heroic playfulness and suspenseful contrasts of scale. That said the opening adventure sequence is an assured stereo set piece and the short preceding the main feature Day amp; Night a high-concept gem.There are several elements in Toy Story 3 that echo its predecessors the outside-world escape plot the reversion of Buzz to factory-setting-level naivety the trustworthiness of new pals. But there are also many witty novelties from a when-Barbie-met-Ken subplot to a 2D makeover for Mr Potato Head and gags about toys as Method actors. This is also a film willing to flirt with darker matter including mortal jeopardy at a landfill freaky clown monkey and baby toys and a flashback in which a toy feels abandoned. Emotional responsibility is mutable in the toy-owner dynamic at some points the toy feels like the owners vulnerable child at others like its diligent parent. Either role these reassuring movies recognise at their darkest moments can yield the kind of despair that prompts one character to growl Were all just trash waiting to be thrown away.

Photo Credit MCT advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT With Andy going away to college Woody and the gang face an uncertain future. BOTTOM LINE Scarier than you might expect but still fun enough to be the best film of a so-far lackluster year. CAST Tom Hanks Tim Allen Joan Cusack Ned Beatty. LENGTH 138 No one said ""Toy Story 3"" would be the end of the beloved Disney-Pixar franchise about a group of toys with lives of their own. But a sense of closure gives the latest movie a surprising power and poignancy. Its sadder and scarier than its predecessors but it also may be the most important chapter in the tale. It opens by acknowledging the inevitable Andy the human owner of our toy heroes for the past 15 years is growing up. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? ""We all knew this day was coming"" the lanky cowboy Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) says as Andy packs up for college. It looks like trash time for Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) cowgirl Jessie (Joan Cusack) and the gang but instead theyre donated to Sunnyside Daycare - a potential paradise for love-starved toys. Unfortunately Sunnyside is actually more like the Georgia prison in ""Cool Hand Luke"" ruled with a smothering paw by Lots-o-Huggin Bear (Ned Beatty). Even without the 3-D this would be a vivid and chilling place; one villain the dead-eyed Big Baby doll seems almost like a symbolic nightmare. John Lasseter the franchises creative force hands the reins to director Lee Unkrich (a Pixar collaborator making his solo debut) and writer Michael Arndt (""Little Miss Sunshine""). As a result the zippy humor (like a metrosexual Ken doll voiced by Michael Keaton) takes a backseat to moments of almost overwhelming emotion abandonment abuse brushes with death. Like it?

Audiences who were kids when Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) first burst out of the box are now off to college and so too is boy Andy (John Morris). Buzz and Woody (Tom Hanks) have been replaced by the most popular adult toy a cell phone. Every Toy Story film is about abandonment. In each the tie between human and toy man loosens; here its undone altogether when mom (Laurie Metcalf) plunks down a cardboard box and tells her son that now is the time to leave behind childish things. And he throws in cowgirl Jessie (Joan Cusack) Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head (Don Rickles and Estelle Harris) Rex (Wallace Shaun) and Hamm (John Ratzenberger) callously--the way John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton have continually shown kids treat their toys. Five-year-olds dont stand for sentiment not when they have a bottle of glue and some glitter handy. Boys and toys are in an emotionally abusive relationship--now when the gang is unceremoniously dumped at a daycare Woodys insistence on rallying everyone back to their bedroom makes him the toy box Tina Turner and the flick is smart enough to know it. With only each other to count on Toy Story 3 makes the most of its ensemble even giving Barbie a handful of actual jokes and her own story arc after shes seduced by Ken and his dream mansion. What happens next is best kept a surprise but make haste for a smart sweet comedy that treats everyone--heroes villains and its audience--with empathy and respect; rare qualities both in condescending kiddie cartoons and on the playground. 0 Comments Be the first to comment You must be logged in to post a comment.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Sweet Escape Pixars Toy Story 3 is a blockbuster with heart as splendid as the previous two and tinged with the same ache of nostalgia that drives summer memories. _ By David Edelstein Published Jun 21 2010 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Disney/Pixar) Back in the sixties and seventies before films became franchises and tent poles before Jaws and Star Wars and corporate-studio ownership changed everything the summer blockbuster wasnt a genre unto itself a megabudget cartoon tooled to help us escape from our lives. It hadnt been commoditized yet. And escapism took different forms. I spent my childhood in an upper-middle-class suburb one of those doomed artificial constructs in which the outside world is kept vigorously at bay. Isolated from the counterculture the war the racial upheavals of the big cities I went to blockbusters like In the Heat of the Night Easy Rider and Woody Allens Bananas to escape to reality. There was lots of crap but of a different order than this seasons The A-Team and Killers and Shrek XXV and Iron Man 2which cost hundreds of millions and are not so much made as microengineered. Ive never blamed Jaws for what happened Its the best summer movie ever made. People forget how real it seemed. It was shot in a beach resort (Marthas Vineyard) in the days when Steven Spielberg was forced to use the world as he found it instead of building one from scratch. I loved the tension between the texture of life and his smooth beautifully modulated movie-ish technique. I saw it opening night in a sold-out electrified house. The movie has whats still my favorite scare Roy Scheider shot from above (with plenty of water behind him) calling out Why dont you guys come down here and shovel some of this shit? and just when were starting to laugh (He said shit) the shark comes out of the blue no preamble no music just teeth and the sound of a crowd shrieking as one. No the beginning of the end was Star Wars synthetic then as now clever but never exhilarating infinitely merchandisable. With any luck this summers most merchandisable blockbuster Toy Story 3 will be the last of the Toy Story movies. Yes there will be pressure on Pixar to squeeze out sequels. But the chances of topping this one are infinitesimal. Its another paradoxical Pixar beauty the high-tech ode to the old-fashioned the vintage the stuff of childhood fantasy play when kids and not computer programmers supplied the imagination. I dont think of the Toy Story pictures as escapism even though theyre rooted in a childs dream of what happens when the lights go out and the toys come to life. At heart theyre about aging impermanence loss and death. Pixar likely borrowed the premise from Thomas M. Dischs The Brave Little Toaster Objects once prized lose their newness and become disposable. But they have spiritual properties and to discard them carelessly is to dishonor the past that shaped us. Its almost Buddhist in how it invests all matter with a life force worthy of reverence. Toy Story 3 has another dimension probably the upshot of creators John Lasseter Andrew Stanton and director Lee Unkrichs getting older and having families. The toysespecially the cowboy Woody (with the voice of Tom Hanks)see the boy who owns them Andy through the eyes of parents with kids who are ready to move on. After a wild prologue with Woody and Tim Allens Buzz Lightyear and Joan Cusacks cowgirl Jessie saving a trainload of orphans from the evil pig mastermindwhich comes to a halt when young Andy is called to dinnerwe jump a decade ahead. Andy no longer plays with toys; hes going off to college. His room is being cleared for his younger sister with her MP3 player and computer. Should the toys be stuck in the attic? Donated to Sunnyside a childrens day-care center? Or left on the curb for the garbage truck? The gang which includes the sisters cast-off Barbie (voiced by Jodi Benson) is scared by the prospect of all those possibilities. After mix-ups and chases they end up at Sunnyside where the toy who calls the shots is the formidable huggy bear Lotso with the great southern stentorian voice of Ned Beatty. Lotso is a character with staturea toy shattered by abandonment who has purged himself of sentiment. And soon our gang discovers he runs Sunnyside as a kind of prison. The big bald baby doll functions as a spooky enforcer and looks like the Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson in Ed Wood movies. A cymbal-clashing monkey is the prison guard of nightmares. Horror of horrors Buzz is reprogrammed to be his old pompous self to help Lotso keep everyone in cages. Suddenly thrillingly Toy Story 3 becomes a prison-break movie. As usual with Pixar the little things win your heart like Woody escaping out the bathroom window but pausing to put down a sheet of toilet paper before stepping on the seat. At Sunnyside Barbie meets Ken (Michael Keaton) and all our cultures Ken-is-gay jokes get a new spin Hes a metrosexual elated at finding someone to whom he can show off his disco wardrobe. The gags are all of a piece right up to the forlorn yet enchanting finale. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 18 2010 1201AM EDT Last updated Monday Mar. 10 2014 613PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Country USA Language English Toy Story 3Directed by Lee UnkrichWritten by Michael Arndt John Lasseter Andrew Stanton and Lee UnkrichFeaturing the voices of Tom Hanks and Tim AllenClassification GTheres one question dangling over the new Toy Story 3 Can Pixar do it again?Fifteen years ago the animation studio initiated a new era in childrens movies with Toy Story the first feature produced entirely by computer-generated imagery. The film about toys that come to life when their boy-owner isnt present featured an almost photo-realistic look and a snappily written script which tapped directly into the imaginations of children young and old. Since then Pixar has earned a reputation as Hollywoods most consistent artistic outfit with nine more films several of which have been among the best films - for children or adults - that Hollywood has produced in the last decade.Their strategy in this third film has been to create a toy-sized action movie designed not only for kids but also for teenagers who were imprinted by the Toy Story universe back in their pre-school days. Written by Michael Arndt ( Little Miss Sunshine) from a story by John Lasseter Andrew Stanton and director Lee Unkrich the script is a smartly calculated mixture of emotional bonding moments humour and elaborate Mission Impossible-style sequences.Measured against such superb Pixar films as Ratatouille Wall-E and Up the new Toy Story has to be seen as a letdown. Occasionally unusual in a Pixar film you find yourself questioning the writers judgment Sticking to the modern action formula this is an overly dark childrens film with scenes of imprisonment torture and a weirdly grim moment when the toys silently hold hands as they face their collective incineration.Some of the humour suggests Shrek-ian smart-alecky double entendres ""Nice As-cot"" says Barbie when she meets the dandyish Ken (voiced by Michael Keaton) who is portrayed as gay and in the closet which seems unnecessary and borderline homophobic. The lapses arent frequent but given Pixars history theyre all the more jarring.At its best most moving moments Toy Story 3 is a story about the pang of a young adult moving away from home and leaving child-like things behind. An overture sequence shows the six-year-old Andy playing out an elaborate action fantasy game in a story of trolls cowboys astronauts and a giant flying pig all leading to narrowly averted catastrophe. We then move to the present day when Andy now long-limbed and 17 is ready to go to college.The fate of his toys lying neglected in a chest is uncertain Will they be thrown out stowed in the attic or donated to a local daycare centre? Each of the toys - including Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) dinosaur Rex (Wallace Shawn) cowgirl Jessie (Joan Cusack) piggy bank Hamm (John Ratzenberger) and Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head (Don Rickles and Estelle Harris) are worried. Woody (Tom Hanks) taking his leadership role tries to comfort them.""All toys go through this"" he explains convinced that Andy will remain loyal or at worst that their future life in the attic will be carefree.Through a series of mix-ups all the toys end up at a daycare. The place appears to be a toy paradise but is soon revealed as a brutal prison. Director Unkrich and the animation team do a superbly creepy job of rendering a daycare as hell complete with wire-framed cages monstrous toy-mangling children and even surveillance cameras monitored by a cymbal-crashing monkey.The warden of the joint a sinister pink plush bear called Lotso (voiced by Ned Beatty and modelled oddly on Big Daddy from Tennessee Williamss Cat on a Hot Tin Roof) is accompanied by a gang of hench-toys. They include a duplicitous Ken doll an octopus and most memorably an oversized baby with one broken eyelid and crayon tattoos.Woody (who sneaks back into the daycare after a sojourn in another house) leads the toys on a version of The Great Escape involving a set of stratagems and several reversals. Along the way Buzz Lightyear gets his computer chip scrambled and Mr. Potato Head briefly becomes Mr. Tortilla Head before they narrowly avoid being turned to ashes.Somewhere behind the Toy Story films is the idea that toys are magic our first guides into the world of imagination. Eventually Toy Story 3 finds its way back to that theme of the power of childhood play. There are a few worrisome moments en route though when not only the characters but the filmmakers seem to have lost their way.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Consider the oft-amusing terribly clever G-rated sequel ""Toy Story 3"" as the brightest student in the class delivering a very fine B paper. Any other year the fact that animation powerhouse Pixars grand summer offering is a sequel -- and a 3D one at that -- wouldnt rankle quite so much. But summer 2010 is turning out to be Hollywoods season of shame in which no studio saw it worth its while to dream afresh. ""Expect the Expected"" might be the tagline. ""In 3D"" So Pixar the outfit that so often does story with brio has gone for the pleasantly familiar over its customary astonishing. That Pixars geniuses are as good as they are means that ""Toy Story 3"" featuring the voices of Tom Hanks Tim Allen and Joan Cusack among others is still likely to work its magic on young uns -- and those adults nostalgic for the amiable company of Woody Buzz Mr. amp; Mrs. Potato Head Hamm and Rex. For the rest of us already tuckered out by the march of the familiar it serves -- as enjoyable as it is -- as a cautionary reminder that even the most gifted filmmakers wont always make incandescent films. The second sequel proves that clever is not the same thing as inventive. That something can entertain without being even a smidge original. Last summers ""Up"" -- a bright true melancholy affair -- is a masterwork in comparison. The loyal toy companions of a kid named Andy first made their sweet presence known in 1995s ""Toy Story."" (Jessie the Yodeling Cowgirl voiced with crackling spunk by Joan Cusack arrived in the 1999 sequel.) In this outing Andy is headed off to college. Hes got choices to make about what stays in the attic what goes with him to college what gets trashed and what gets donated to a day-care center. Andys quandaries are his loyal playthings existential crisis. If hes willing to kick them to the curb for morning trash pickup why should they be dedicated to him? Favorite Woody argues for fealty even as they all wind up at a day-care center. Sunnyside the center in question is either haven or hell. Leader of the day-care toys Lots-o-Huggin-Bear (Ned Beatty) ambles into a room leaning on a cane and offering cane-sugar welcomes. This sad-news bear recalls Burl Ives snowman in ""Rudolph the Red- nosed Reindeer"" only with a whiff of the suspect. And Sunnyside has the feel of that TV specials Island of Misfit Toys. Escape is a must. The delights in ""Toy Story 3"" -- and there are still a number of them -- are primarily situational. For instance how does one say ""hoot"" in Spanish? Because es un grito when Buzzs factory settings are rebooted. Barbie (Jodi Benson) makes a love connection with Ken natch. As the ascot-wearing rigid-moving metrosexual (voiced by the comedically agile Michael Keaton) hes master of his pastel dream house and owner of a walk-in closet full of retro duds. Some things are just meant to be. This sequel introduces other new toy personalities some charming others a bit disquieting. A new fave the unnerving Big Baby a shirtless doll with a lazy eye and a clumsy infant way about her. And little kid Bonnie whose mother works at the day-care center not only has a terrific imagination but introduces us to her own crew of sweetly game toys. There are also pleasures in the snappy repartee of the still-winning toys. Wallace Shawns Rex remains jittery and amusing. The Potato Heads (Don Rickles and Estelle Harris) have some spud-acular scenes. Still the story itself is a bit well plastic. With all the hankering for the old stuff -- by studios not by audiences -- perhaps it makes a kind of poetic sense that ""Toy Story 3"" is very much about nostalgia The toys ache for the now-grown youngster who enjoyed them; college-bound Andy looks on at them with fond but conflicted feelings about letting go. Its real emotion; its just not new to the franchise. How much value children find in nostalgia is debatable. Their memory lane doesnt even run a mile yet. And if filmmakers dont provide them with new journeys wont it run shorter still? Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com.

One might add in a related vein that the attics are full of indispensable toys--once central players in a childhood fantasy now upstaged outgrown and consigned to the corrugated purgatory of a cardboard box. Such is the cruel afterlife facing the eponymous heroes of Toy Story 3 as the film opens. In the 11 years since the last installment of the Pixar franchise their half-pint custodian Andy has grown up and as he prepares to debark for college retirement looms for Buzz Lightyear Jesse Rex Ham the Potato Heads and the rest of their narrow Toyverse. (Though not Woody who initially appears fated to accompany Andy to school as a childhood memento--a touching plan but one that if my own collegiate memories are any guide would likely entail Woody being refashioned into a bong by sophomore year.) Andy however makes the mistake of putting his attic-bound ex-playmates into a plastic garbage bag and his mother makes the mistake of assuming this was not a mistake. After a brief flirtation with the sanitation department (it will not be the last) the gang finds themselves delivered to a local daycare presided over by a Strawberry-scented pink bear named Lotso (short for ""Lots-o-Huggin Bear"") who promises them an endless stretch of play-filled days with a rotating cast of kids who will never grow old. This Paradise is no sooner found than it is lost though and the bulk of the film delightedly toys (so to speak) with the conceits and conventions of the prison-break genre. By Pixars lofty standards Toy Story 3 is not a particularly ambitious film. Unlike most of the studios offerings it lacks any particular ideological infrastructure (The Incredibless quiet embrace of individualism Wall-Es indictment of consumerism Ups exploration of grief and renewal). Though it reprises the originals metaphor of disposability as mortality it does little to extend it--as Toy Story 2 did by weighing a pristine immortality against the everyday messiness of love and loss. Nor does it mark a visual milestone in the manner of Wall-E. But if Toy Story 3 doesnt quite represent the transcendent whole of recent Pixar pictures it boasts its share of transcendent moments a fashion show put on by Barbies new Ken; a flamenco display by Buzzs Latin alter-ego; a baby doll playing Darth Vader to Lotsos Emperor; and (trust me on this) Mr. Pita Head. The returning vocal cast--Tom Hanks Tim Allen Joan Cusack et al.--is characteristically excellent and the newcomers are if anything better still. As Lotso Ned Beatty offers the most compelling portrait of avuncular villainy since well Ned Beatty in Network and Michael Keatons Ken is the quintessence of himbo-ism. Tucked away in smaller roles are such talents as Jeff Garlin Timothy Dalton and Whoopi Goldberg. And as it has done before--who can forget Brad Birds glorious Edna Mode?--Pixar saves a few gems for contributors who typically find themselves on the other side of the lens (or rendering machine as the case may be). As sad clown Chuckles artist/animator Bud Luckey (last heard as the narrator in the Pixar short ""Boundin"") has the films best monologue the chilling tale of a good bear gone bad. But a close runner-up is the jailhouse wisdom of the Chatter Telephone voiced by Teddy Newton (who also directed the marvelously high-concept short ""Day amp; Night"" that precedes the feature).Toy Story 3 may be relatively speaking a simple pleasure. But a pleasure it remains by turns earnest and ironic wistful and wicked. For all its clever allusions the movie never descends into idle knowingness or manic jokery. And if its closing scenes tip somewhat further toward sentimentality than is customary it is an understandable indulgence. Toy Story was after all Pixars first-born and the 15 years of ensuing maturation seem to have passed in the blink of an eye. As it should Toy Story 3 offers a worthy heartfelt sendoff to Woody Buzz and the gang--from Andy from Pixar and from all of us. See also Christopher Orr on the secret to Pixars success.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics. Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P. McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Gary Cameron / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 62 A Man Who Can Be Baited With a Tweet James Fallows None Last night in her overall very successful acceptance speech Hillary Clinton said with ruthless precision about her opponent Ask yourself Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading daily sunny/Flickr What an Introvert Sounds Like Olga Khazan The World Well-Being Project uses Facebook updates to correlate language with personality traits. Do our Facebook posts reflect our true personalities? Incrementally probably not. But in aggregate the things we say on social media paint a fairly accurate portrait of our inner selves. A team of University of Pennsylvania scientists is using Facebook status updates to find commonalities in the words used by different ages genders and even psyches. The so-called ""World Well-Being Project"" started as an effort to gauge happiness across various states and communities. ""Governments have an increased interest in measuring not just economic outcomes but other aspects of well-being"" said Andrew Schwartz a UPenn computer scientist who works on the project. ""But its very difficult to study well-being at a large scale. It costs a lot of money to administer surveys to see how people are doing in certain areas. Social media can help with that.""

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Sanderson on how men and women experience marital satisfaction differently Whenever Im walking around D.C. with friends on sunny Saturday afternoons we inevitably see lots of babies adorable fat charmingly bald babies. Its not uncommon to hear sighs of ""oh my gosh hes so precious"" and ""I want one"" from my companions; I too have been accused of being a baby stalker from time to time. But at The Atlantics One Day University event on Saturday Amherst psychology professor Catherine A. Sanderson made a convincing case that cute kids (and cute husbands and wives) might seem different when theyre yours to keep. She gave a witty lecture on what social science can tell us about happiness and these were my three biggest take-aways First I will no longer have to worry about being awesome if I get married because my husband will probably be happier for having taken vows regardless of how great I am. In studies of marital satisfaction over time Sanderson said ""there is in fact a positive correlation for some people. Guess who those people are? Men. For men yeah being married makes you happier and the good news is it doesnt matter at all who youre married to. It could be like a mail-order bride from Russia--does not matter at all.""

The studio has certainly earned the right to revisit the films that put Pixar and computer animation on the map with a vastly entertaining sequel that will doubtless pour untold hundreds of millions into Disneys coffers. GALLERY The Best Animated Movies After more than a decades absence from the big screen Woody Buzz and company return in style. Before the opening credits theres a rip-roaring fantasy train chase through Monument Valley that alternately pays homage to and skewers the work of Disney stable-mate Jerry Bruckheimer. We then see a series of home-movie clips of the toys owner Andy (John Morris) growing up that seems perhaps a tad too determined to tug at the heartstrings of several generations of moviegoers. Andy leaving for college in a few days impulsively decides to take Sheriff Woody (delightfully voiced once again by Tom Hanks) with him -- and throws the rest of the toys he hasnt played with in years (including Tim Allens Buzz Lightyear) into a garbage bag bound for the attic. After a narrow brush a trash collectors Buzz and the rest -- except for those little green soldiers who go AWOL -- decide being donated to a day-care center is preferable to sitting untouched in the attic. Woodys loyalties are torn between his master and his friends and basically the themes of loss and transition so beautifully portrayed in the second film (which topped the original) are replayed. Also replayed is the still-amusing concept of the blustery Buzz having multiple personalities -- in this sequel one of them speaks in subtitled Spanish. This felt like a three-star movie to me until the last half-hour when director Lee Unkrich (an assistant director on the second film) takes a delightfully dark turn that brings ""Toy Story 3"" closer in spirit to the more recent and sophisticated Pixar classics like ""WALL-E"" and ""Up."" The day-care center Sunnyside turns out to be more like a prison camp presided over by a seemingly jovial stuffed bear named Lotso (Ned Beatty) who has been twisted by loss in his past. The writers -- including Pixar honcho John Lasseter (who directed the two previous installments in 1995 and 1999) and Michael Arndt (""Little Miss Sunshine"") -- have a truly inspired idea for Lotsos chief henchman Barbies Ken portrayed as a preening closet case in Michael Keatons hilarious voice performance Ken and Lotso are abetted by an ominous damaged Betsy Wetsy knockoff straight out of a horror movie. The films most inspired section is a brilliant thrilling Woody-led version of ""The Great Escape"" with a junkyard climax that may actually be too scary for sensitive little ones. Although Little Bo Peep -- the least interesting of the original characters -- vanished in a yard sale the filmmakers have not neglected to provide funny dialogue and moments for fan favorites. These include feisty cowgirl Jessie (Joan Cusack) the dyspeptic Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) the neurotic dinosaur Rex (Wallace Shawn) the silly Hamm (John Ratzenberger) and the airheaded Barbie (Jodi Benson). Timothy Dalton has a very funny cameo as a Shakespearean hedgehog and Emily Hahn voices young Bonnie who takes the same delight in her toys that Andy once did. ""Toy Story 3"" (which is pointlessly being shown in 3-D at most locations) may not be a masterpiece but it still had me in tears at the end. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Late Warhol souper-sized Read Next Late Warhol souper-sized Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 43044 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 29331 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops 17915 Braves Brian McCann interest may pave way for Gary Sanchez Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

""Toy Story 3"" from the ever-reliable purveyors of digital charm at Pixar is a bona fide summer delight loaded with action humor nostalgia a veritable blizzard of pop-culture references and general good vibes. Add in the extra revenue from widespread 3-D projection and the dismal Hollywood summer of 2010 has finally found its zillion-dollar windfall.Should I be reviewing ""Toy Story 3 as a business trend instead of a movie? Well of course not but its tough to resist when the two are virtually inseparable. I enjoyed this latest and perhaps last episodic odyssey of Woody Buzz Lightyear and friends tremendously -- lets face it the voice cast is getting pretty long in the tooth -- especially because preview screenings for family-oriented movies like this are about the only occasions when critics and media pros bring their kids and the experience is very different. (My 6-year-old twins are curious but cautious about ""TS3; they wanted me to check it out first.) Some early and mildly intense action scenes scared the bejesus out of a quite little girl behind me aged 3 or 4 which is as close as Im going to get to a parental advisory.""Toy Story 3 will play tremendously well to a big mixed crowd and will keep on doing so deep into the summer no doubt. Its a beautifully animated film loaded with rich and atmospheric detail (to which in my judgment 3-D projection adds almost nothing). Its got just enough readily accessible gags and emotions for the younger set and a high enough ""aww"" factor for the most movie-averse grandparents. But of course its real audience is twofold young adults who look back fondly on the first two ""Toy Story"" films and somewhat older parents who may be watching this yarn of childhoods end through a double glaze of nostalgia and life experience. (Given that the first ""Toy Story"" came out 15 years ago its definitely possible to belong to category A and category B simultaneously.)Much of the charm of Pixars productions to be sure comes from this mode of cheerful collective calculation. You never get much sense of individual authorship in Pixars movies -- this ones directed by Lee Unkrich co-director of three earlier Pixar titles from a script he wrote with Michael Arndt John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton -- but there is a central impish sensibility behind the studios storytelling. Pixar pictures are all about splitting the difference Movies for kids loaded with jokes for adults or vice versa; traditional storybook archetypes mixed with conventional social satire; ""family values"" yarns infused with a faintly left-liberal communitarianism. Perhaps consciously its a next-generation update of the way the Disney studio made movies during Walts lifetime.Certainly theres more than enough mix-and-match jammed into ""Toy Story 3."" It begins as a pell-mell action movie (causing that little girl behind me to announce loudly that she wanted to go home) out of D.W. Griffith by way of a ""Superman"" serial then quickly becomes a bittersweet family yarn about the putting aside of childhood things. (Can it be argued that the entire ""Toy Story"" series is a meditation on themes of loss and mortality? Im pretty sure it can.) Thats all before it becomes a prison movie or rather a prison movie mixed with one of those sci-fi stories about a future utopia with a dark secret.It even -- or so some critics more imaginative than I have suggested -- channels bits of minimalist French director Robert Bressons ""A Man Escaped."" And maybe Auschwitz movies. Just to scramble away from that interpretation as quickly as possible I havent yet mentioned the hi-frickin-larious Ken-and-Barbie disco number which is completely irrelevant to the story but might be the best thing in the movie. Or the stretch when Buzz Lightyear is transformed into a flamenco dancer a faintly xenophobic one-note gag extended to sadistic length.I guess its a good thing that ""The Brave Little Toaster"" was also a Disney film (and one made more than 20 years ago) because for anybody who happens to have dragged that VHS tape out of storage recently the plot of ""Toy Story 3 might seem a tad familiar. Now I know -- the story of toys (or appliances or whatever) who come alive and must embark on a dangerous and harrowing homeward quest is not exactly copyrightable. Just off the top of my head you could also cite Margery Williams ""The Velveteen Rabbit"" Russell Hobans ""The Mouse and His Child"" and Kate DiCamillos ""The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane"" among the childrens literature faintly echoed in ""Toy Story 3."" But Ill just invite you to consider the scope and extent of ""Toaster"" influence herein and then come back and talk about it. You Might Also Like So Andy (still voiced by John Morris who in real life is 25) affectionate owner of Cowboy Woody (Tom Hanks) space ranger Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and their entire cohort of pals is heading off to college. The toys havent been played with in years and are more or less prepared for an ""orderly transition"" to life in the attic. Theres already a racetrack up there as Woody hopefully points out ""And those guys from the Christmas decorations Theyre kind of fun right?"" One day after all Andy might have kids of his own and then ... This is one of several scenes in ""Toy Story 3 where kids may feel slightly bored or baffled while the parents in the audience sniffle quietly.Calamity strikes of course and all of Andys toys except Woody -- the ensemble includes Cowgirl Jessie (Joan Cusack) Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head (Don Rickles and Estelle Harris) Rex the dinosaur (Wallace Shawn) and Hamm the piggy bank (Pixar in-joke John Ratzenberger) -- are erroneously donated to a day-care center. At first it seems like an earthly paradise for orphaned toys whose population is ruled by a benevolent purple bear called Lotso (this is Ned Beatty delivering the movies standout performance) and his lieutenant Ken (Michael Keaton) who boasts an eye-popping collection of 70s and 80s leisure wear.But oh no indeed not. Lotso and Ken are not as genial as they appear and they promptly imprison Buzz Jessie the Potatoes et al. in the dreaded ""Caterpillar Room"" there to be assaulted munched painted and dismembered all day by the most fearsome creatures of all toddlers. But the fellowship of toys thus divided in Tolkienesque fashion must be reunited Woody must somehow break into the day-care center -- and no sane toy would willingly enter that place of suffering -- and then contrive to get all his buddies out past Lotsos borderline-sinister minions and back home to Andys before its too late. Its a rich and heartfelt adventure yarn if perhaps a little too scary for the youngest children that brings these abandoned toys to the brink of a final and terrifying doom and then finds a wonderful resolution to what seems an impossible dilemma. Andy really is too old for Buzz and Woody after all; how can a distracted 18-year-old possibly reward their loyalty? Pixars animated humans are still no match for their animated objects but Morris does a lovely job of finding an essential sweetness in Andy. He is still able amid a wider world of electronic gizmos and school and girlfriends to reconnect with his younger self just long enough. I can remember that acute teenage sensation Youre excited about leaping forward into adult life but you dont always want to let go of childhood altogether. (OK lets be honest The feeling persists for decades and perhaps indefinitely.)Theres a certain middle-aged wistfulness in the last several Pixar films that verges on postmodern decadence. Only ""Cars"" and ""Ratatouille"" among the studios recent output actually seem like movies primarily made for young viewers. (My kids found ""Up"" alternately tedious and frightening and I cant imagine too many kids under 12 enjoying anything about ""Wall-E."") ""Toy Story 3 is no exception despite its heritage; its about the pain of leaving childhood behind like the agonizing last chapter of A.A. Milnes Pooh books.Whats a little more troubling at least to me is the way that Pixar movies honor the very things they themselves are replacing. Its a little like the way shopping malls are often named after geographical features now buried under the parking lot Cottonwood Creek Centre or Sawgrass Mills. ""Cars"" might be the epitome of this Pixar tendency a story about an old-fashioned small town inhabited by automobiles -- that was doomed by the rise of the automobile. In the same way the ""Toy Story"" films depict children who play imaginatively with old-fashioned low-tech toys like Buzz and Woody all day instead of zoning out in front of ""Toy Story"" films. Im not sure whether to call that hypocrisy or self-criticism or appealing fantasy; I can only wish it resembled real life. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

"Toy Story 3 movie review A Story that just keeps getting better |       NJ.com comments Toy Story 3 movie review A Story that just keeps getting better Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on June 18 2010 at 1237 AM updated June 18 2010 at 929 AM View/Post Comments Disney/PixarBuzz Lightyear and Woody get acquainted with Lots-o-Huggin Bear at the day care center the toys now call home.If you want to blame the decline of everything on anything you can start -- and end -- with the words ""good enough."" Its the shrugging excuse that accompanies every slipshod effort from a piece of legislative ""reform"" (which changes nothing) to a ""custom-built"" home (made of toxic drywall) to a ""value"" meal (packed with re-heated sludge). Ah well. Yeah not great. But you know. ""Good enough."" I dont think thats something thats ever said at Pixar.Toy Story 3 (G) Disney (97 min.) Directed by Lee Unkrich. With the voices of Tom Hanks Tim Allen. Now playing in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys rating Four stars Ratings note The film contains mild plastic peril.Their latest film for Disney ""Toy Story 3"" even offers a great excuse for not-so-great filmmaking. Its a sequel. Its in 3-D. It has no kiddie-flick competition. Really how good does it have to be? Apparently as good as Pixar can make it. Its not that every Pixar film has been wonderful -- the character design in ""Cars"" was ugly and obvious and ""Ratatouille"" was sort of unpleasant. (Rodents stirring stockpots? No thanks.) But even those films never felt like the animators were cutting corners. And movies like ""Up"" ""WALL-E"" ""The Incredibles"" and the original ""Toy Story"" were as good as it gets. This sequel stands next to them. Its been 11 years since the last ""Toy Story"" some of that the result of a nasty fight between Pixar and the Mouse Factory. And the new film acknowledges that gap. Now Andy our toy-loving hero is a teenager about to leave for college. Misunderstandings ensue and eventually Andys old playtime friends -- and ours -- end up in a day care center. Which for a toy is apparently one step down from a Turkish prison. The situation offers an opportunity for a few movie jokes a Pixar favorite (expect lots of ""Cool Hand Luke"" references). But mostly its a chance to see and hear these characters again -- like Tom Hanks brave and true Woody the cowboy Tim Allens deliriously heroic Buzz Lightyear and Joan Cusacks wry cowgirl Jessie. A chance to encounter new friends too as Barbie meets the man of her dreams. (And yes he comes with a pastel leisure suit and the kind of varnished self-regard rarely seen outside of Ryan Seacrests bathroom mirror.) Its all fun but also artfully done with an attention to detail thats obsessive -- in a good way. The Ken doll moves just as a Ken doll would; the wind-up monkey hits his cymbals in perfect mechanically joyless spasms. Scenes are nicely paced; climaxes build upon climaxes.Its all artfully done but also full of raw feeling. This is a computer-generated animated film about toys -- it could feel triply artificial. Yet its theme of loyalty is beautifully drawn. And the connection you have to these creatures is astonishing. Really watching it I realized I owed some old G.I. Joes an apology. Especially for that incident with the Zippo. So yeah maybe the tomatoes on your super-saver sub seem to be made out of the same pressed cardboard as that bookcase you bought at the big-box store. Maybe the garbage guys leave your cans in the street and nobody -- nobody -- can make a classic daiquiri anymore. But so what? Its all good enough right? Well no its not. And ""Toy Story 3"" proves just how good something can be -- if somebody simply cares.

Starring the voices of Tom Hanks Wallace Shawn Tim Allen Michael Keaton and Ned Beatty. Directed by Lee Unkrich. (G. 103 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Like the best of fairy tales ""Toy Story 3"" is more serious than it seems and hardly seems serious at all. This third installment in Pixars ""Toy Story"" series is fun and lively and will please the kids. But in spirit it really completes another trilogy - one that includes ""Wall-E"" and ""Up"" - with its moving contemplation of mortality human value and memory. ""Toy Story 3"" is a better film than ""Wall-E"" and ""Up"" in that it succeeds completely in conventional terms. For 103 minutes it never takes audience interest for granted. It has action horror and vivid characters and it always keeps moving forward. Its also less obvious in its ambition. ""Wall-E"" and ""Up"" were like experiments in profundity. In ""Toy Story 3"" everything meaningful is just part of the flow. Youll feel it before you see it coming. At the same time ""Toy Story 3"" ultimately cuts deeper than those earlier attempts. Andy who once played with toys as a child is about to go off to college and the toys are worried about their future. Will they accompany Andy to college? Will they be stored up in the attic? Or will they - horror of horrors - be thrown away? Woody (Tom Hanks) tries to put a good face on things assures everybody that they wont be thrown out and talks up the idea of the attic but hes not too convincing. The situation will speak to children because it echoes the powerlessness of kids in the face of adult decisions. But it will speak to adults too who are much more aware of their inevitable obsolescence and who know that fellowship and good intentions provide no escape from the plastic bag and garbage truck that awaits us all. Seemingly effortlessly - but it couldnt have been effortless - the filmmakers lay out a situation guaranteed to hit everyone where they live and they do this within minutes. The story really starts when the toys find themselves donated to a day care center which at first seems like an ideal fate. At least theyll get played with. But thats how things often are A situation that seems idyllic turns out to be awful. A host (in this case a stuffed bear voiced by Ned Beatty) who seems relaxed and genial turns out to be a damaged monster. ""Toy Story 3"" might be a childrens film but the older you are the more youll know its true. The story mixes comedy drama and action with impressive skill except this is beyond skill - this is inspired. The scenes in which the toys attempt their escape are as exciting as anything found in the best prison movies. The concentration camp metaphor - the daily torture and the ongoing threat of annihilation - cant have been accidental. A harrowing scene inside a garbage-processing plant removes all doubt of that. Yet so much of the movie is funny and tied to the specific foibles of the characters. A Ken doll (voiced by Michael Keaton) whos a self-serving henchman at the day care center is revealed as having a fatal comical weakness vanity. Weve gotten this far with no mention of the visuals. I saw the ""Toy Story 3"" in 3-D and its impeccable though for this movie two dimensions will serve just as well. Pixar doesnt make a fetish of its three dimensions and ""Toy Story 3"" has a lot more going for it besides good looks. Its technologically and philosophically sophisticated honest about life yet hopeful ultra-modern and yet as old-fashioned as its toys. Its a kind wise and very beautiful thing.

Disney/Pixar By Joe Morgenstern Updated July 16 2010 1201 a.m. ET When the strains of ""Youve Got a Friend in Me"" swell up in ""Toy Story 3"" Randy Newmans now-classic song speaks for the toys as always--for Woody Buzz Lightyear Mr. Potato Head and all the other treasured playthings who have basked in the love of their owner Andy and given the little boy their devotion in return. By now though the song can also speak for a studio thats become our friend. In an era of increasingly cheesy sequels churned out by entertainment conglomerates Pixar has been the Fort Knox of honest feelings and so it remains. Fifteen years after ""Toy Story"" burst upon the scene as the first full-length animated feature created completely on computers the third film of the trilogy turns out to be gorgeously joyous and deeply felt. Only the toys are essentially unchanged albeit scuffed and worn in a family thats been transformed by the passage of time. Andy no longer a boy is college-bound. Buster no longer a pup is so old and fat he can hardly walk. Since no one seems to want the toys any more they find their retirement prospects looking grim until theyre consigned to a local day-care center called Sunnyside. Watch a scene from the film ""Toy Story 3."" Video courtesy of Disney/Pixar. Throughout the evolution of the series Toy Story storytellers have put forth powerful themes in the gift- wrapping of animation. (This film was directed by Lee Unkrich from a particularly resonant screenplay by Michael Arndt who wrote ""Little Miss Sunshine."") Sunnyside provides a perfect place to explore some new ideas starting with the perils of fidelity versus the benefits of emotional detachment. Woody Buzz and the others including a distraught Barbie have suffered the pain of being cast off by their beloved Andy (though the facts of the case are more complex) but all of the toys at Sunnyside are castoffs and as one of them says no owners means no heartbreak. At first the day-care center looks like toy heaven. The permanent residents--the toys not the pouncing shrieking toddlers who come and go--could not be more welcoming. In gauzy slo-mo Barbie meets a too-hip narcissist named Ken who wants her to live with him in his dream house. (He models his wardrobe for her in one of the movies funniest bits though its topped by a moment when she impersonates him with ambiguous results.) Barbie is not the airhead she seems to be--at one point in the hallowed tradition of ""Legally Blonde"" she declares that ""authority should derive from the consent of the governed""--but neither is Ken a trustworthy toy. And trust mustnt even be used in the same sentence with Lotso an ominously unctuous old teddy bear whos the eminence grise--plus fraise; he smells of strawberries--of the daycare centers playthings. (Lotso or more formally Lots-o-Huggin Bear is voiced by Ned Beatty whose flavorsome characterization reminded me of Andy Griffith in ""A Face in the Crowd."" Among the other superb vocal performances are Tom Hankss Woody Tim Allens Buzz Don Rickless Mr. Potato Head and new to this crowd Michael Keatons Ken.) I dont want to make ""Toy Story 3"" sound like ""Darkness at Noon"" when its one of the most entertaining films since well ""Toy Story 2"" but the Sunnyside section has pungent things to say about the nature of dictatorships before it morphs into a blissfully anarchic variation on the theme of ""Stalag 17."" (Two of the scarier jailers in the joint are a mindless cymbal-clapping monkey and a blank-faced bottle-sucker called Big Baby though the scariest thing for Woody and his buds is the change that comes over Buzz.) Spectacular escapes and stirring reunions constitute the sine wave that has pulsed through all of the Toy Story films. Still the climactic escape here ranks as one of the most remarkable creations in the history of animation. (Its a sequence whose relentless intensity will be frightening to very young children yet theres hardly a hint of it in the movies many trailers.) And it isnt talking trash to say that Pixar has a special way with garbage--planetary piles of it in ""WALLE"" and now toward the end of this film concentric circles of it surrounding an iconic inferno. But then to state what is pleasurably obvious Pixar has a special way with every phase of making movies. Psyches scan without seeming schematic. (Lotsos behavior we learn from touchingly witty flashbacks springs from having been abandoned too.) Inspired set pieces succeed one another with remarkable regularity Buzz exploding into action as a Spanish-speaking flamenco dancer and incipient Lothario; Woody taking woozy flight beneath a hang glider; Mr. Potato Head his body parts in disarray and his head pressed flat as a tortilla struggling hilariously yet nobly like Chaplins Tramp to put himself right. Curious minds will want to know how ""Toy Story 3"" compares to TS1 and TS2. Inevitably it lacks the startling novelty of the first one Since the break of that dazzling dawn in 1995 weve come to believe that computer animators can do anything they please which they can. Its possible that nothing could have matched the authentic heartbreak of Buzz Lightyears earlier discovery that he is not a real space ranger on an alien planet but a piece of plastic powered by batteries and made in Taiwan. (If you want to know what superlative storytelling looks sounds and feels like theres a scene to study.) In every important sense though the new film proves worthy of its predecessors. The pace is swift without being oppressive. (Other producers of summer fare please take note.) The production is strewn with visual and verbal zingers along with silent moments of great eloquence. (As a young man about to go out into the world Andy takes Woody and Buzz from his toy box for one last time and gazing fondly at them relinquishes his childhood.) To appreciate the magnitude of the achievement its useful to remember what ""Toy Story"" was and what the trilogy has come to. From the start its essential elements were friendship innocence retained in the face of adversity and abiding love dramatized with beautiful clarity--the love between Andy and his toys that fostered a similar relationship between the movies and their audience. Here we are a significant part of a lifetime later and almost miraculously the filmmakers have sustained their original impulses and found an ideal ending for the characters in their care. I wont tell you what that ending is but it took my breath away and Ill bet it takes yours. Do see this lovely film sooner than later. As Lotso tells Buzz ""Youve got a play date with destiny.""    ENLARGE The title characters in the short Day amp; Night. Disney/Pixar ""Toy Story 3"" is being shown in both digital and IMAX 3-D as well as in conventional 2-D projection. I saw the digital version and found its illusion of depth agreeably understated. Just in case youre wondering about the depth of the studios bench the feature presentation will be preceded in all theaters by a short as is Pixars custom but a sensationally original short ""Day amp; Night"" that was made by a rising star of animation named Teddy Newton. The six-minute film which combines 2-D and 3-D techniques and was scored by Michael Giacchino looks like nothing youve ever seen and plays like a dream of glories to come. Cyrus As if one terrific movie werent enough this week also brings us ""Cyrus"" a dulcetly crazy certifiably hilarious and eerily mysterious little comedy written and directed by the Duplass brothers Jay and Mark. The films structure is a skewed triangle. John C. Reilly is John still a lost soul seven years after his divorce. (It doesnt help that his ex played by Catherine Keener is about to remarry.) All the same hes trying to find himself in the wistful hope that theres someone to find and Marisa Tomeis Molly convinces him that there is. Coming out of nowhere at a party John has forced himself to go to she is everything he could have wished for--smart kind pretty and in his ecstatic phrase a sex angel in the bargain. The only complication is her tangled relationship with her 21-year-old son Cyrus who lives at home and is played by Jonah Hill. ENLARGE Jonah Hill as the title character Marisa Tomei as his mother and John C. Reilly as her boyfriend in Cyrus. Fox Searchlight So far you know no more than you may have learned from the movies marketing campaign and thats the way its going to stay--not just because I dont want to tell you more but because I couldnt tell you without discussing the pathology of it all which the film scrupulously avoids doing. Whether its a folie a deux or a trois the Duplass brothers want us to savor the spectacle of John Molly and Cyrus not understand it to death. And theres so much to savor The quicksilver tone sometimes guarded and sometimes confessional but always perfectly controlled; a sense of danger that ebbs and flows like a toxic tide; a quasidocumentary technique that seems to capture reality--or the trios alternate realities--on the fly and three brilliant performances that revel in the shimmering weirdness of the script. Mr. Reilly has made a specialty of playing appealing nebbishes but this John is something else--charmingly plaintive quite consciously witty and improbably good company. Ms. Tomei can be touching without batting an eye but her tough and tender Molly has a dreamy side that can turn her suddenly opaque. And Mr. Hill a ubiquitous presence in youth comedies these days shows himself to be a casual master of ambiguity; a chasm yawns between what Cyrus says and what he means. Ive seldom seen a film in which three intelligent articulate people make so many penetrating observations about themselves and address their bizarre situation so directly without providing or indeed possessing the slightest clue to whats really going on. On the surface ""Cyrus"" operates as a bright brittle farce that Feydeau might have enjoyed. Deeper down though lies the haunting question of whether honesty and candor--and the naked anger that flashes between the two men--can change that situation at all. Maybe theyre all exactly as crazy as they need to be.

"Movie review Toy Story 3 - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Toy Story 3A welcome love note to movies that has fun with its endearing characters yet isnt afraid to put genuine emotion onscreen.June 18 2010|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Movie Critic If Pixar is the only sure thing in movies today a and it is a then the ""Toy Story"" franchise is its most reliable component. So while its not exactly a surprise to say that ""Toy Story 3"" is everything you hoped it would be it is something of a relief. For as survivors of say "" The Godfather Part III"" remember the third time can be the death knell for a much admired series. ""Toy Story 3"" has prospered where others have faltered because it has simultaneously stayed true to its roots and expanded its reach. And because in ways both small and large the people behind the franchise simply love movies to death. Directed by Lee Unkrich and starring the familiar voices of Tom Hanks Tim Allen Joan Cusack Don Rickles Wallace Shawn and the rest of the toy gang ""Toy Story 3"" pays attention to the reasons we return again and again to the motion picture experience. As written by Michael Arndt an Oscar winner for ""Little Miss Sunshine"" ""Toy 3"" manages to offer jeopardy and thrills plus unexpected moments of melancholy while never forgetting to have the most fun possible. Best and most characteristic of Pixar overall it understands genuine emotion and is not afraid to get it up there on the screen. On one level the story of a group of toys trying to live up to their responsibilities and deal with change on another a treatise on the end of childhood and the importance of love and meaning in life ""Toy 3"" continues to do the impossible by making us believe that toys are people too idiosyncratic individuals with lives and minds of their own. The films unobtrusive 3-D version enhances this reality without calling attention to itself. Director Unkrich was an editor on the original ""Toy Story"" and co-directed ""Toy Story 2"" but that is not the only way franchise continuity has been maintained. A ""Toy Story"" brain trust including executive producer John Lasseter and producer Darla K. Anderson met to block out the main action Andrew Stanton (who co-wrote the first two scripts) then did a treatment and finally Arndt whos worked for Pixar since 2005 took on the script. Given that its been more than a decade since the previous chapter ""Toy Story 3s"" core notion is nothing if not organic Andy (John Morris) the young boy who owns all the ""Toy Story"" toys has quite simply gotten older and is in fact only a few days away from heading for college and leaving his toys behind. As Lasseter has explained in the toy world ""when youre broken you can be fixed; when youre lost you can be found; when youre stolen you can be recovered. But theres no way to fix being outgrown by the child."" Not that Andys toys have given up far from it. Led as always by top gun Sheriff Woody (Hanks) and intrepid spaceman Buzz Lightyear (Allen) the gang launches Operation Playtime a desperate maneuver to remind Andy of their existence and get him to play with them one more time. Needless to say it doesnt work and that sends the toys into a tailspin. ""This is just sad"" one of them says dinosaur Rex (Shawn) moans that he ""hates all this uncertainty"" Buzz Lightyear suggests everyone get ready to go into ""attic mode"" but Woody steadfastly insists that ""Andys going to take care of us."" Furthermore he maintains that it is a toys responsibility to always be there for Andy no matter what sacrifices that entails. Through a series of mistakes and misadventures Andys toys end up in Sunnyside a cheery-looking daycare center where they are welcome with open arms by Lots-o-Huggin Bear Lotso for short the head toy in the place voiced with a folksy silver-tongued brio by Ned Beatty. Forget those fears of daycare as a dumping ground for unwanted toys Lotso says. ""No owners means no heartbreak"" the bear proclaims. ""We own ourselves we control our own destiny."" Despite these assurances Woody escapes from Sunnyside because of his loyalty to Andy but before he can reach home he is adopted by a little girl named Bonnie (Emily Hahn) and gets to hang out with her toys who view themselves as a kind of amateur theatrical troupe. ""We do a lot of improv here"" Woody is told and the very proper Mr. Pricklepants ( Timothy Dalton) a hedgehog in lederhosen approvingly inquires ""Are you classically trained?"" Its at Bonnies that Woody finds out some dark truths about Sunnyside a ""a place of ruin and despair"" says the morose Chuckles the Clown (Bud Luckey) a and determines in his best all-for-one-one-for-all mode to attempt to rescue his beleaguered friends. This is but the merest outline of a plot ""The A-Team"" team would envy but even though theres a great deal of atmosphere and suspense in ""Toy 3"" (the production design team visited Alcatraz to get in the mood for Sunnyside) its the films comic moments which linger longest. To see Lotsos pal Ken ( Michael Keaton) show off his extensive wardrobe for Barbie ( Jodi Benson) or to witness Buzz Lightyear when he goes into an unexpected flamenco mode is to be in the presence of the unforgettable. Lots of connections to other films dot ""Toy Story 3"" nods to the westerns of John Ford the animation of Hayao Miyazaki and the kind of prison films where someone plays the harmonica on death row. But more than that by creating the emotions we have always counted on and so rarely find anymore this film becomes the kind of love note to movies we want and need. kenneth.turanlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESThe Good Dinosaur moved to 2015 leaving Pixar with no...September 18 2013Ellen DeGeneres Nemo sequel Finding Dory set for 2015April 2 2013For John Lasseter Pixars boyish visionary Cars 2 is a...June 21 2011Cover Story A whole life out thereDecember 7 2010Toy Story 3 director Lee Unkrich can breathe easyJune 18 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesPixarJohn LasseterAndyCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-toystory-20100618,0,2489391.story",200,toystory319,toystory3,latimes

His cowgal pal Jessie rides to the rescue and space ranger Buzz Lightyear is as always eager to take his friends ""to infinity -- and beyond"" But even they may be no match for the spaceship that descends and when its doors open reveals ... ... Reveals in the first scene of Toy Story 3 that the boy Andy has a terrific time playing with his toys. In a bedroom strewn with all kinds of characters from cowboys and astromen to a Slinky dog and Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head the 7-year-old mashes genres together to accommodate them all. Toys trigger what the movies director Lee Unkrich calls a childs ""crazy non sequitur imagination."" They unlock his creativity let him play out elaborate scenarios inspired by films and TV shows hes seen and then remade in the wild innocence of a young mind -- one that knows all the rules of narrative but doesnt mind smashing them with Dadaist abandon. (See a photographic history of Pixar.) Thats the creative strategy at Pixar which produced the first computer-animated feature Toy Story in 1995 and has bloomed ever since through Finding Nemo WALLE and last years Up. Pixar filmmakers have to be able to tap into their vestigial child their inner Andy. In that sense the Toy Story series is their collective autobiography. Like Andy the Pixarians -- from creative director John Lasseter on down -- are smart kids who never renounced their childish belief that anything is possible. Why to make an instant classic like Toy Story 3 it just takes an unfettered imagination several hundred artists and technicians about 200 million and four years of nonstop work. Childs play. In 15 years the Pixar unit has produced just 11 features. The first 10 -- Toy Story; A Bugs Life; Toy Story 2; Monsters Inc.; Finding Nemo; The Incredibles; Cars; Ratatouille; WALLE and Up -- are not just some of the best computer-animated films but some of the liveliest brightest most heartfelt movies of the recent past. That they have earned lots of money (5.6 billion worldwide) for Pixar and its parent company Disney is almost beside the point. Like the earliest Walt Disney fables Pixar films are for children and their parents and everyone who can be touched by moving images. ""We dont make movies for kids"" Unkrich says emphatically. ""Our mission statement is to make films for everybody."" That includes the Motion Picture Academy Pixar has won five of the nine Oscars for Best Animated Feature and the last three in a row. (See the top 10 voices behind Pixar characters.) Okay but a third Toy Story from a studio where nine of the first 10 features were total originals? Lasseter who directed and co-wrote the first two Toy Story films and whos supervising second episodes of Cars and Monsters Inc. allows that some people ""make sequels as a way of printing money and they tend to rehash the same idea."" He insists Pixar returns to favorite characters because ""they are alive in us. We think of them as friends and family. We want to see what new deeper emotions we can find."" For Toy Story 3s screenwriter Michael Arndt (who won an Oscar for writing Little Miss Sunshine) that meant rethinking each old toy and finding unsuspected human wrinkles. The films visual style bracingly clear in its 3-D version is both state-of-the-CGI-art and faithful to the simple design of the first two films. ""I wanted it to look great"" says Unkrich who served as editor on the first Toy Story and co-director on the second. ""But it also had to look like Toy Story."" Whats more potent is the upping of the emotional ante. TS3 puts its characters and the moviegoing children who love them in their severest crisis yet. Not since the early Disney classics have cartoon characters faced so dire a threat with such heroic grace. Lasseter recalls a meeting of the Pixar brain trust for the first reading of the story. ""By the end"" he says ""I had tears streaming down my face. I looked around the table and we all had tears."" Watch TIMEs video ""How to Be a Cartoon Voice."" See the best movies of the decade.

It gave me time to blot away my tears before entering the lobby. Yes I cried and laughed and bit my nails and felt my heart expand a little bit in my chest. Once again the wizards of Pixar have turned a gaggle of old playthings into some of the most captivating fully realized and touching characters onscreen today. The third (and likely final) episode is a funny sentimental and unexpectedly thrill-packed payoff for the series that began 15 years ago. The human characters have aged in approximately real time. Andy the toys owner is now 17 and heading off to college. His neglected toys kidnap his cell phone in a ploy to recapture his attention and lure him back to their storage chest. But Andy is putting aside childish things. The toys hope for a life of plentiful playtime when theyre donated to Sunnyside Daycare Center. Woody Buzz Lightyear dinosaur Rex piggy bank Hamm and the gang get a guided tour from Lots-o-Huggin Bear the folksy foreman of the preschool playthings. The change of venue introduces a raft of new characters to the mix including Barbie and her clotheshorse pal Ken and creepy cockeyed Big Baby. When their new humans prove to be abusive age-inappropriate droolers Andys toys learn that Lots-o is not as warm and fuzzy as he seems and the story becomes a sly suspenseful homage to prison-break pictures. Oscar-winning screenwriter Michael Arndt (""Little Miss Sunshine"") honors the standard Pixar template and extends the themes of the earlier ""Toy Stories."" Like all Pixar films this generates a playful friction between high-spirited humor and serious themes. Every Pixar story revolves around childhood issues of separation anxiety and the grownup need to find a meaningful identity. What makes Pixar the worlds best film studio is its dedication to meticulously crafted stories. Those dramatic dilemmas back there in the shadows ensnare our emotions making us fret for the characters when theyre in peril and cheer when they do something clever. TOY STORY 3  out of 4 stars Rating G Gag-a-minute DreamWorks films have a higher humor quotient theoretically but Pixar movies delight on a deeper level. In keeping with the idea of outliving ones usefulness ""Toy Story 3"" adds a thread of tension with the threat that the toys could end up as landfill. The movie finds moments of honest pathos in the prospect. In ""The Wrestler"" Mickey Rourkes over-the-hill grappler calls himself a piece of meat no one needs anymore a sentiment anyone past age 50 can understand. Substitute ""plastic"" for ""meat"" and youve got the toys predicament. The white-knuckle finale bringing the toys face to face with a monstrous recycling shredder may be overwhelming for the youngest viewers. It certainly agitated me. But if that sounds like heavy stuff it isnt. This is a dazzlingly inventive film overflowing with flash and fun. There are superb sight gags -- Mr. Potato Heads plastic features transposed onto a floppy tortilla for instance or Buzz capering like a caballero when hes switched to Spanish-language mode -- and showers of verbal wit. Barbie has a standout moment when she says something surprisingly philosophical and well-reasoned. Director Lee Unkrich (co-director of ""Toy Story 2"" ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Monsters Inc."") doesnt even need words to tickle us. I shouted with laughter over one joke that paid off with a sigh and another that concluded with an infant blowing raspberries. As always the production details are flawless. ""Toy Story 3"" is presented in 3-D and the effects are subtle and appropriate. Tom Hanks continues to give sincerity a good name as the steadfast Woody and Ned Beatty makes Lots-o superficially welcoming but secretly cynical. Thats a lot of layers for a stuffed bear. The fade-out is an affecting farewell to the classic characters and adults who find themselves identifying with the dear old castoffs may want to wipe their eyes before the lights come up. Those darned 3-D glasses have a way of misting up sometimes dont they?

And that passage of time is the emotional cornerstone of the new ""Toy Story 3"" a smartly conceived beautifully executed sequel that rounds out a ""Toy Story"" trilogy. Early on in ""Toy Story 3"" you can tell that things have changed a lot in the world of the toys and their owner Andy. After a rousing opening sequence that re-establishes our connection to the main characters we realize that Woody Buzz and friends have actually been in box in Andys room for what appears to be years. Some of the toys from the two previous films (notably Bo Peep) are gone having been donated or thrown away. The last of the plastic soldiers desert in search of someone who will play with them. The toys are feeling unloved deprived of their raison detre playtime. ""Come on lets go see how much were going for on eBay"" grumbles Hamm the piggy bank at one point. But the worst is yet to come. Andy now 18 is going off to college and the toys (with the exception of Woody still the most beloved toy) have no place in that world. So Andy packs up Buzz Jessie the Potato Heads Hamm Rex and the others to store in the attic. Barbie a doll his younger sister no longer plays with gets tossed in for good measure. But instead of being banished to the attic the toys first have a brush with disaster (getting tossed in the trash) and then are donated to the Sunnyside Day Care center by Andys mother.Advertisement At first Sunnyside -- preceded over by the folksy Lotso a Care Bear-esque stuffed animal -- looks like toy heaven on Earth a place where toys are played with (and loved) all day. Theres even a Ken for Barbie who apparently has never had a mate. But things are not as they seem which Woody -- who goes in search of his friends after theyre sent off to Sunnyside -- realizes before the rest. To go into detail would spoil some of the movies twists so lets just say that the rest of this ""Toy Story"" movie turns into a lavishly imagined prison break that pays mini-homages to such live-action films as ""The Great Escape"" ""Cool Hand Luke"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption."" It is intense emotionally rich and -- at key moments -- scary to the point that it makes you wonder how ""Toys Story 3"" got a G rating when the last two Pixar films ""Wall-E"" and ""Up"" received PGs. Director Lee Unkrich -- who worked on the first ""Toy Story"" and co-directed ""Toy Story 2"" -- and scriptwriter Michael Arndt (a Pixar outsider who won a best original screenplay Oscar for ""Little Miss Sunshine"") have done a good job of combining the classic (and much-loved) characters of ""Toy Story"" with new toys that quickly establish their own personalities. They also generally manage to inject a darker tone without losing the warmth and humor that made the first two films instant classics.Find things to do Browse our event listings Restaurant listings Movie listings | Movie theaters Concert listings Performing arts listings As always the voice work is impeccable whether its Tom Hanks reprising Woody and Tim Allen who gets some of the funniest moments as Buzz or newcomers Ned Beatty as Lotso Jodi Benson as a not-so-ditsy Barbie and Michael Keaton as a Ken who really wants to be a boys toy and overcompensates. And visually the film is positively stunning with chase sequences that eclipse anything in the first two pictures. Pixar is the one studio that really knows how to use 3-D to its best advantage never allowing the technology to overwhelm the storytelling. Still its hard to shake the feeling that some of the sheer joy and charm of the first two movies are missing from the third installment. There was an emotional glow to what came before that simply isnt burning as brightly. Perhaps its that ""Toy Story"" and ""Toy Story 2"" set such impossibly high bars that the creators of the third film forced some things in an effort to go even higher. Whatever the reason some of the magic is missing. Reservations aside ""Toy Story 3"" is a terrific film that ends with an emotional payoff that should satisfy all who have invested in the characters over the past 15 years. In a summer that will be littered with bad sequels bad 3-D and bad storytelling it is a movie to be heartily embraced.

Disney Pixar/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Pixars ""Toy Story"" movies just keep getting better. The latest and I hope not last installment ""Toy Story 3"" has more emotional power than either of its predecessors. Come to think of it it also has more emotional power than most of the live-action movies out there. Expertly mounted in 3-D the movie begins with the 6-year-old Andys toycentric imaginings complete with thrill-ride-type pyrotechnics for his favorites including homespun cowboy Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) comically stalwart Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and the rest.What makes this sequence so thrillingly comical is that it parodies the Jerry Bruckheimer-Joel Silver school of blam-pow filmmaking even as it tops its effects. Its also a marvelous demonstration of how movies can inspire kids to create entire fantasy worlds. (The ""Toy Story"" films certainly serve that function.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? But the pyrotechnics turn out to be a prequel to the central story. Andy now 18 is college-bound. Excepting Woody he packs up his toys for the attic but his mother mistakes the bag for trash. This sets in motion a series of events that lands the lot including Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head (Don Rickles and Estelle Harris) and Jessie (Joan Cusack) inside the precincts of the suspiciously cheery Sunnyside Day-care Center. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Looking forward to a lifetime of playtime with an inexhaustible supply of tots Andys toys soon realize to their horror that Sunnyside presided over by a strawberry-scented plush named Lots-o-Huggin Bear (Ned Beatty) is no refuge Its more like a prison. Woody initially smuggled into Sunnyside with his friends must ride to the rescue as ""Toy Story 3"" which began as a riff on hypercharged action movies turns into a jailbreak escapade - and a surprisingly effective one too.Director Lee Unkrich and his screenwriter Michael Arndt understand that whimsy and slapstick in this series can only take you so far. The almost nightmarish scenes of confinement at Sunnyside are keyed to an even darker subtext the sadness of Andys toys at being abandoned. Once they were happy. Now their only choice even if they break free of Lots-o and his minions is the attic.Before he turns savior Woody in yet another mix-up finds himself ensconced in the playpen of little Bonnie (Emily Hahn) whose gaggle of toys rivals his old pals eccentric charms. (I particularly liked Timothy Daltons Mr. Pricklepants.) Much later Bonnie and Woody and the rest will figure in a denouement that is one of the most moving leave-takings Ive ever seen in an animated film.It never fails to amaze me - though given all the precedents it shouldnt - how animated and computer-generated creatures can trigger such deep-seated human emotions. The ""Toy Story 3"" filmmakers dont play down to their audiences young or old and perhaps this is why they are able to move so effortlessly between hilarity and sadness without missing a beat. They understand that life is a rollercoaster continuum.Kids watching ""Toy Story 3"" will recognize right away that this is something special. It speaks to them in their own language which of course turns out to be everybodys language. The best childrens films arent only for children.

"" Toy Story 3"" I said. ""I mean grown-up movies"" she responded.Therein is the lingering misconception about Pixar films including this third chapter of the companys flagship franchise. Yes kids love the characters and the whimsy and of course they love toys. But any discerning moviegoer can watch Toy Story 3 and marvel at the perfect execution of every set piece and the unforced warmth of inanimate characters come to life. Or appreciate the life lessons and big themes - in this case loyalty and change - embedded in the story so carefully that they never come close to sermonizing.Ive said it before and I hope to say it many times again in years to come Pixar makes grown-up movies you can take the kids to not kids movies the grown-ups might happen to like.Times are changing for Woody Buzz and the rest of the toy crew. Andy is heading to college (typical Pixar nuance characters that age in real time) so its time to bid farewell to his old playthings. A mix-up diverts the toys from their destination in the attic to a local day-care center where they look forward to being played with again at last. This is after all what a toy would live for if a toy could in fact live. If you let it Toy Story 3 actually works as an existentialist parable. Once you accept that the toys have lives which takes about a nanosecond you want those lives to count for as much as possible. These toys need a purpose that lies beyond their owners childhood love.Well you know what they say about the best-laid plans of mice men and Mr. Potato Head. It turns out Sunnyside Daycare is ruled by an avuncular but despotic Lots-o-Huggin Bear (voiced by the great Ned Beatty). Lots-o has serious emotional scars and abandonment issues and hes quick to consign the new arrivals to the dreaded Caterpillar Room where rough youngsters use toys as battering rams glue depositories and other unseemly functions.This gives Toy Story 3 occasion to become the best prison-escape movie in recent years or at least since Aardman Studios sublime stop-motion adventure Chicken Run in 2000.Comparing Toy Story 3 to the flabby line of sequels belched from the Hollywood conveyor belt doesnt seem fair. Theres nothing recycled about the story and the new characters including Ken (Michael Keaton) a hulking (and kind of scary) baby doll-enforcer and a toy telephone-prison informant keep the dramatis personae fresh.If Toy Story is the new gold standard for the proper care and feeding of a movie franchise then Toy Story 3 may be the best example yet of Pixars knack for creating vibrant new worlds in miniature. A junk-food vending machine becomes a secret hangout for scheming toys to play cards and plot dirty deeds. A garbage dump becomes a fiery inferno (with a friendly nod to the trash compactor scene in Star Wars). The mastery of scale and timing is breathtaking as everyday places and things morph into magical or treacherous kingdoms. You have the option of seeing the film in 3-D but the visuals will pop off the screen in any format.The technical wizardry only enhances Toy Story 3s emotional resonance. Those that were shocked to find themselves sobbing through the opening moments of Up will recognize the sensation of following animated characters that seem more human than humans. Like the best fairy tales Toy Story 3 distills the most elemental feelings - friendship loss forgiveness - into a shimmering nugget.This is where other filmmakers and production teams could learn a thing or two from Pixar. The story part of the Toy Story movies should never be underestimated Director Lee Unkrich and his co-writers Michael Arndt John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton simply know how to weave a timeless tale and you get the feeling they could do it in any movie medium. They dont just take us back to when we were kids. They bring childhood to the present day where we can view it through the prism of adult experience and understanding.Beneath all the excitement Toy Story 3 is about growing up and the challenges of saying goodbye to all that. The irony is that we dont have to Toy Story 3 excels as a magical movie-going fountain of youth. Meanwhile the Pixar folks remain the closest thing we have to genuine movie magicians. Long may they ride.Director Lee UnkrichStarring The voices of Tom Hanks Tim Allen Joan Cusack Ned Beatty Michael Keaton Jodi Benson Don Rickles Wallace Shawn John Ratzenberger Estelle Harris and othersRun time 103 minutesMPAA rating G (some mildly crude humor) editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Starring Tom Hanks Tim Allen Joan Cusack Don Rickles Wallace Shawn Estelle Harris John Ratzenberger Ned Beatty John Morris Laurie Metcalf Director Lee Unkrich Running time 143 Release Opened Jun 18 2010  Editorial Review Toy Story 3 is an emotional roller coaster youll want to ride again By Ann HornadayFriday June 18 2010 ""For every laugh a tear must fall"" was one of Walt Disneys most famous nostrums. The secret of Disneys success hasnt been lost on Pixars John Lasseter who has taken those words to heart since teaming up with the studio. Last year ""Up"" reduced viewers to blubbering sobs in the first heartbreaking 20 minutes. In ""Toy Story 3"" Lasseter and his team plunge the audience into a collective case of empty- nest syndrome with a dash of mortal terror thrown in for grins. And again they make it work. ""Toy Story 3"" still possesses the enchantment and wonder of the first movie which when it was released in 1995 unleashed untapped potential in the forces of Baby Boomer nostalgia mythic storytelling and the aesthetic and expressive depth of computer animation. ""Toy Story 3"" builds on that tradition presenting ""Toy Story"" rep players Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) Buzz (Tim Allen) Jessie (Joan Cusack) as familiar if gently used old friends. (Their now-grown owner Andy is voiced by Jon Morris.) This is Pixars first Imax movie and its also in 3-D. Although the benefits of technical bells and whistles arent immediately apparent the color scheme and bold visual design look terrific right down to the little details for which fans have come to adore just about anything Pixar sprinkles its magic dust on (like the yoga studio bumper sticker on Andys moms car or the way they infuse dull VHS tape with a burnished nostalgic glow). Cannily the producers and screenwriter Michael Arndt have set ""Toy Story 3"" during the week before Andy goes to college which just about fits the generation of kids who came of age with the first two films and strongly chimes with the anxieties and bittersweet feelings of their parents. The story revolves around fears of abandonment and the inability to let go with Buzz and Jessie and the gang being sent to a day-care center that winds up being as one survivor puts it a place of squalor and despair ""run by an evil bear who smells of strawberries."" That bear voiced by Ned Beatty heads up his own gang of left-behinds including a hilariously vain Ken doll (Michael Keaton) and a terrifying baby doll who does her masters bidding like a battered once-cute-now-creepy toddler zombie. The toys breakout from the day-care center winds up being the ballast of ""Toy Story 3"" which takes its cues from ""Cool Hand Luke"" and assorted prison-break flicks and culminates in a scene of near-death which after several episodes of darkness and peril seems gratuitously excessive. But for every tear a laugh a new group of toys Woody meets includes a veddy serious hedgehog named Mr. Pricklepants (Timothy Dalton) who approaches pretend tea parties with the thespian seriousness of Daniel Day-Lewis. ""We do a lot of improv here"" explains a unicorn named Buttercup (Jeff Garlin). Later one of the original toy characters undergoes an amusing change in character that leads to ""Toy Story 3"" being the first of the franchise to need English subtitles. Ultimately every ""Toy Story"" movie is about story not just the films plot or narrative but the stories the characters want to be in when Andy plays with them. Its just this deep sense of longing -- inevitably giving way to loss and acceptance -- that will bring adult viewers to that Disney-approved point of smiling even as they weep openly. Its an emotional dissonance Pixar has always been supremely comfortable with as ""Toy Story 3"" once again proves with knowing humor wildly imaginative visual virtuosity and bittersweet rue. Why choose either glee or despair they insist when you can have both? Contains some themes that may be frightening for the youngest viewers.

"Toy Story 3 is the best Toy Story of them all. Slate Sign In Sign Up Toy Story 3 is the best Toy Story of them all. Toy Story 3 is the best Toy Story of them all. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 17 2010 503 PM Tear Story The wonderful highs and lows of Toy Story 3. By Dana Stevens After youve seen Toy Story 3 check out our Spoiler Special discussion You can also download the program  here or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed  via iTunes or directly with our  RSS feed. Toy Story 3 In a montage midway through Toy Story 2 (1999) Sarah McLachlan sings ""When She Loved Me"" (a song that like all three of the Toy Story scores was written by Randy Newman) while a cowgirl doll named Jessie tells the story of Emily her former owner. Emily treasured Jessie above all else until she began to grow up. Gradually nail polish replaced stuffed animals on Emilys dresser and Jessie languished un-played-with beneath the bed until a teenaged Emily put her in a box and dropped her off at Goodwill. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Moments before the screening of Toy Story 3 (Disney/Pixar) began my viewing companion and I were remembering the waterworks that inevitably accompany that montage. (I just watched it online before embedding the link above and yep cried again.) Stories about the waning of childhood fantasy the process by which our earliest playthings are divested of their once-magical aura touch on an experience of loss thats familiar to everyone but thats seldom depicted in art. ""That kind of story gets to me more than any other"" confessed my friend as the lights went down and we donned our 3-D glasses. Advertisement He had no idea what he was in for or how grateful we would both be for the glasses to hide behind. Like the marriage montage near the beginning of Up the last 10 minutes of Toy Story 3 seem to have been developed in collaboration with an ophthalmologist specializing in the production of tears. Maybe Pixar has one on staff? The mournful message of Jessies song which takes up only a few minutes of screen time in the otherwise boisterous adventure that is Toy Story 2 makes up the entire theme of Toy Story 3. This may be the most emotionally grueling film ever aimed at children. (Though keeping in mind that Toy Storys original child audience has now grown up the film has been designed to appeal to adults as well.) In Toy Story 3 our now-beloved cast of playthings confronts the irreversible forward march of time the pain of abandonment the loss of love. These are some existentially engaged friggin toys. And yet the overwhelming mood of the movie is one of ebullience generosity and joy. That weepy ending combined with the laugh-per-second energy of the hour and a half that preceded it sends the viewer out of the movie in a state of cathartic uplift as if shed been Rolfed. (But dont float out before the final credits--theyre packed with high-quality Pixar Easter eggs.) For those who havent seen or dont remember the first two films (its been incredibly 15 years since the first one came out) the toys in question are owned by Andy a little boy who was perhaps 7 when the series began. Hes now 17 and packing his room to leave for college. (The director Lee Unkrich catches us up on his life with a cleverly conceived home-video montage.) After some deliberation over whether to donate his old toys or keep them in the attic Andy sentimentally opts for the latter--but his mother thinking the unmarked bag of toys is trash carries it out to the curb. Its up to Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) the one toy Andy has set aside to take to college to sneak outside and save his friends. What follows is an intricately plotted chase that eventually lands the toys at a day care center called Sunnyside--a place where all is not as it seems. Woody Jessie Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and the rest are welcomed by the seemingly benign Lots-o-Huggin Bear (Ned Beatty) whom another character will later refer to in a fearful whisper as ""that evil bear who smells like strawberries."" Lotso assures them that at Sunnyside theyll once again find children to care for them. Instead Andys former toys are banged and splattered by a roomful of hyperactive toddlers and when they try to escape held prisoner by Lotso his silently menacing sidekick Big Baby and a clothes-mad Ken doll (Michael Keaton) whose morality isnt the only ambiguous thing about him. Advertisement The idea-generating table at Pixar must be one lively and raucous place because if theres a toy-related visual gag conceivable by the human imagination its somewhere in this movie. Shot after shot bursts with whimsical weirdos popping out of boxes and scuttling atop shelves Theres a Fisher Price rolling telephone who communicates only by ringing up his interlocutor. A monster robot guy who toggles in between two expressions--happy and mean--by pounding his own head. A lederhosen-clad hedgehog (hilariously voiced by Timothy Dalton) who fancies himself a gifted thespian. And a brilliant long-form gag that raises the ontological question In what feature of a Mr. Potato Head (voiced by Don Rickles) does the spuds spiritual essence reside? But somehow the profusion of characters jokes and action sequences never feels disorienting or excessive. Through it all the toys motivation remains simple and crystal-clear They must get back home to the boy who grown up or not still loves them. As for that last sequence after they do--hold up. I need a moment. Go ahead and sneer it Is there anything wrong with Toy Story 3? Well the addition of 3-D to the franchises universe does seem like a move motivated more by marketing than artistic necessity (which was also the case I thought with Up). The depth effect looks crisp enough but with a couple of somewhat gimmicky exceptions it rarely gets used. (That weakness is more than overcome in Day amp; Night a wordless short that precedes the movie and is the most inventive use of animated 3-D Ive ever seen.) And I guess--racking my brains here--that a few of the newly introduced characters are a little underwritten. (Though Ken is a marvel--one of the most complex characters animated or otherwise to appear on screens this year.) Anyway nitpicking a movie this abundantly stocked with wonderments feels like an act of ingratitude. Toy Story 3 is a near-perfect piece of popular entertainment a childrens classic that will be watched and loved when my daughters (and one day her daughters) now-beloved toys are gathering dust in a basement.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + When it comes to movie sequels the third time is rarely the charm. Threequels are usually a desperate attempt to squeeze life out of a fading brand and theres not much in the first half of ""Toy Story 3 to make you think any differently. How can this be? Were talking about Pixar the gold standard not just for family films and computer animation but pop culture as a whole. How can John Lasseters gang of super-geniuses fall asleep at the switch?Turns out theyre only playing possum. After an hour or so of going through the motions -- albeit entertainingly -- ""Toy Story 3 rouses itself rung by rung of visual and conceptual invention until it can stand close to the level of Pixars best. More than that The heart still beats in this franchises digital chest.Not to scare you off but ""Toy Story 3 is also about death and life after death. Its certainly about endings. What happens to toys when the child grows up -- when the beloved Andy (now voiced by John Morris) heads off to college? Most of his playthings are headed for the limbo of the attic spaceboy Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) cowgirl Jessie (Joan Cusack) timid Rex (Wallace Shawn) doughty Hamm (John Ratzenberger) the Potato Heads (Don Rickles and Estelle Harris).Only Woody (Tom Hanks) is granted entrance to Paradise Andy wants to take him along as a dorm-room mascot. Before that can happen though mistakes and misadventures result in all the toys being rerouted to a place that only looks like heaven a local day-care center run by an after-hours cabal of toys with an ax to grind. Chief among them is Lotso (Ned Beatty) a plush strawberry-scented huggie-bear whos a little too reminiscent of Andy Griffith in ""A Face in the Crowd. In other words dont turn your back on this guy.Up to now the movie has been engaging but not close to Pixars usual game especially since the company upped the stakes with ""WALL-E and ""Up. (By contrast the short that plays before ""Toy Story 3 is a breathtakingly ingenious comic collision called ""Day and Night -- so inherently visual I cant describe it in words -- that announces a new Pixar talent in writer-director Teddy Newton.)Despite Lasseter gaining control in 2006 of Disney animation in general and this sequel in particular theres an ordinariness to the dialogue and too many contortions to get the characters where they need to be. The jokes seem old. The toys do too. Thats the point but its also beside the point.Its when ""Toy Story 3 becomes a jailbreak movie that it comes into its own. Playing with genre always gets the Pixar juices flowing and the writers (director Lee Unkrich plus Lasseter Andrew Stanton and Michael Arndt) mount our heroes escape from their day-care Alcatraz with fiendish wit and enough complexity to flatter 6-year-olds and their parents. Everything starts clicking into place not with far-fetched plotting but the sort of exalted higher thinking of ""Monsters Inc. and ""The Incredibles. The movie starts to lift off then to soar right over the walls of the family-movie ghetto. The 3-D that in the early scenes seems merely a gimmick becomes a subtly drawn stage in which grander gags and fresh emotional resonances can unfurl. The newer characters come into focus too. Michael Keaton has been drafted to play a Ken doll as a preening metrosexual fop one whose bravado crumbles when his vintage collectible Nehru jacket is threatened. Theres a stuffed hedgehog with a Laurence Olivier complex voiced by Timothy Dalton a depressive clown (Bud Luckey) a screeching mechanical jailhouse monkey an eerily silent Baby Doll (shades of the mutant toy in the original ""Toy Story) and a tough-talking toy phone (Teddy Newton) out of a noir classic. Someone has even thought to throw in a stuffed Totoro on loan from Hayao Miyazakis dreamy universe.Woody and his friend go through a few changes too. ""Toy Story 3 hits a high point of comic surrealism when Mr. Potato Head is forced to reinvent himself as Mr. Pita Bread Head -- its harder than it looks especially when a pigeon turns up -- and Buzz goes through more personalities than Joanne Woodward in ""The Three Faces of Eve. A mistimed electronics reset turns him into Spanish Buzz Lightyear an achingly funny Latin lover hankering for a paso doble with Jessie. (The soundtrack obliges with a flamenco remake of ""Youve Got a Friend in Me courtesy of the Gipsy Kings over the end credits.)Unkrich and company keep pushing the envelope though and ""Toy Story 3 ultimately brings the characters to a Stygian recycling plant -- a junk underworld worthy of WALL-E himself -- where theyre forced to contemplate an annihilation that is total and complete. This is heady stuff for a kiddie flick evidence of Pixars larger recent concerns and at first glance it sits uneasily with the make-believe whimsy of the ""Toy Story franchise. How metaphysical exactly do we want Buzz Lightyear to be? (A dad I talked to after the screening said his 7-year-old handled it fine but that he was glad he left the 4-year-old at home.)Yet the tale needs to go that far into the dark to come back into the light and for the first time in a ""Toy Story installment the twists of the climactic scenes and the emotions they conjure up carry a weight that feels deeply and powerfully earned. Its a sign of the innate grace of the Pixar philosophy that this feels like it could be and should be the last ""Toy Story movie and that our final glimpse of Woody and his friends is in the only afterlife a toy could ever want.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Here was this vivid color-saturated dimensional piece of animation. The contrast between its brilliant textured digital images and the tried-and-true toons audiences were accustomed to was profound. (That years traditionally drawn entries A Goofy Movie and Pocahontas.)Toy Story went on to earn kabillions and made Pixar a household brand.And now after 10 hugely successful and innovative films (including Toy Story 2 in 1999) the studio has brought astro hero Buzz Lightyear pull-string cowboy Woody and their gabby gang of toy pals back for another round.And Pixar wants us to pay premium prices to watch em with 3-D glasses on.It kind of defeats the purpose. CG-animation technology has gone into hyper-drive over the last 15 years - the images are more dimensional more detailed more alive. Donning those black plastic stereoscopic glasses may enhance the visual experience here and there but more often it detracts The tinted lenses rob the film of its brightness and even the illusion of depth becomes less satisfying. Disney-Pixar rereleased Toy Stories 1 and 2 in 3-D last year to prep audiences for Toy Story 3 - and the added gimmick felt like just that a gimmick.As for the second sequel - 3-D or 2-D - it may not have the emotional resonance of its precursors but it certainly dazzles When Woody clambers onto a rooftop framed by leaves and sky its an exhilarating cinematic experience and the new character Lotso (voiced by Ned Beatty) a strawberry-scented plush toy bear has ""fur"" thats slightly grimed from years of use and abuse in a day-care center. The mix of photorealism and playful design elements is beyond deft.And speaking of that day-care center its called Sunnyside; one of its longtime toy residents describes it as ""a place of ruin and despair."" With Andy Buzz and Woodys no-longer-a-kid owner packing up and heading for college his toys (Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head Hamm Jessie Rex Slinky Dog et al.) find themselves in this new unfamiliar home. It looks pretty good at first until a swarm of terrorizing tots descends hurling banging and madly maiming Andys collection of trusty playthings.And Lotso it turns out isnt as welcoming a figure as he first appears. Theres something sinister going on at Sunnyside. And Buzz Woody and company need to figure out how to get back home.Although Toy Story 3 plays with themes of aging and obsolescence its really a straight-ahead action pic with the toys planning and attempting their escape and rescue missions. (Hey its The A-Team) Theres a pretty scary sequence on a recycling-plant conveyor belt thats like some nightmare Disneyland ride. A battered doll dubbed Big Baby wobbles around with a wonky eye and pen tattoos on its arms - definitely creepy.And even Mattels Barbie boyfriend Ken (Michael Keaton) here to provide comic relief and an eye-popping array of 80s-era mens fashions turns out to have a dark side. Toy Story 3 may in fact frighten more than a few younger ones in the audience. Despite its G rating there are intense moments.With the reliably amusing voice work of Tom Hanks (Woody) Tim Allen (Buzz) Wallace Shawn (Rex) and Joan Cusack (Jessie) and some clever comic conceits (Buzz accidentally switched to Spanish-language mode for one) Toy Story 3 is solid smile-inducing stuff. But by the inherent nature of a sequel and our familiarity with the main characters the glow of originality has dissipated. Theres something generic about this Pixar property and that third-act recycling plant looks an awful lot like a metaphor with or without 3-D glasses.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

ABOUT THE MOVIEToy Story 3    (out of four)Stars Tom Hanks Tim Allen Michael Keaton Director Lee UnkrichDistributor Walt DisneyRating GRunning time 1 hour 43 minutesOpens midnight Thursday in select cities; nationwide Friday By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The 3-D horn-rims necessary to fully experience the masterpiece that is Toy Story 3 serve an additional useful purpose a way to hide the tears any sentient being will surely shed by the films heartfelt conclusion. TRAILER Whats in the Toy box? VOTE What is your favorite Toy Story scene? How the animation wizards at Pixar keep coming up with innovative and rapturous stories is one of the miracles in modern film. How director Lee Unkrich veteran Pixar writers John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton and Little Miss Sunshine co-writer Michael Arndt devised a fresh plot and enchanting characters in this third Toy Story go-round is perhaps the most impressive feat of all. This installment the best of the three is everything a movie should be hilarious touching exciting and clever. The voices behind Woody (Tom Hanks) Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and the rest of the playthings contribute mightily to the character development in what is easily the summers best movie thus far. The tale touches the heart as no movie in recent memory has done. Who would think a movie about plastic toys could speak so powerfully to audiences of all ages? Years have gone by since 1995s Toy Story. The toys boy Andy is now 17 and about to leave for college. His sister Molly is an iPod-listening tween and the once-peppy family dog has slowed to a crawl. Andys toys have been amusing themselves though consigned to a toybox. But the gangs future is uncertain Will they get played with again or languish in lonely obscurity in a dusty attic? Following a few twists the toys end up at Sunnyside day care center ""a place of ruin and despair"" according to the dramatic Mr. Pricklepants (Timothy Dalton). The movie segues into a prison escape thriller with apocalyptic undertones the suspense always leavened with laughs. The beloved characters are back Woody Buzz cowgirl Jessie Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head Dinosaur and Barbie. But their character arcs take new turns. Buzz goes bilingual and Mr. Potato Head sheds his spud for a tortilla. They tangle with formidable foes including an ascot-wearing Ken doll the wonky-eyed Big Baby a worn purple teddy bear named Lots-O-Huggin and a screeching Monkey. The movies message is simple Despite time and distance family and friends are what count most. Change is not to be feared and even mortality can be faced with pluck and dignity. These themes fuel but never overpower the adventure. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Standards Editor Brent Jones.

Share Tweet Deep into Toy Story 3 theres a moment where some of the toy protagonists realize that in spite of all their cleverness and determination theres no way out of the fatal trap into which theyve fallen. In any other childrens film this would be a time for comedic panic long-withheld personal confessions or dramatic statements that would immediately turn out to be ironic. In any other childrens film the moment would quickly peak and pass. But Toy Story 3 director Lee Unkrich (Finding Nemo Monsters Inc.) holds for long excruciating moments on the silent characters as they pass from disbelief into sorrowful resolve then take each others hands and wait. And wait. And wait. Its a shockingly grim sequence but this is what Pixar films do best find a place of deep emotion and explore it without blunting it overexplaining it or passing it off with a laugh. Toy Story 3 never gets darker than this moment but time and again it similarly finds real resonant emotion in the antics of a bunch of childrens toys having adventures when nobodys looking. That emotion starts with the toys pathetic desperation as their owner now 17 and headed to college fails to play with them no matter what ruse they try. While loyalist cowboy Woody (Tom Hanks) insists they should stand by the boy even if he wants them all in a trash bag in the attic his blinkered devotion is more creepy than sweet. But the film never plays this for humor either; his dedication is as real and important to him as his friends burning desire to move on find new kids and get played with again. Which sets up a lot of conflict and frantic hijinks involving a day-care center separations and reunions and action that playfully evokes films from The Great Escape to Cool Hand Luke. TS3 doesnt entirely dodge some of the current kid-movie standards; Unkrich brings in an astonishing crowd of celebrities to voice even the most minor characters and lets a pop song express the comedy of one moment. But the film never lets banter visual gags or the usual manic kid-flick running about interfere with its more delicately handled thoughts on loyalty longing broken relationships and generational continuity. It honestly earns its emotion moment by painstakingly executed moment.

CLICK PIC for more toys on screen. (Disney Pixar) Joe Neumaier Thursday June 17 2010 205 PM Title Toy Story 3 Seeing the big world through the eyes of its tiny characters in ""Toy Story"" back in 1995 we knew the folks at Pixar were in touch with what childhood feels like. And with its 1999 sequel they showed us they really understood what its like to grow up.Yet in ""Toy Story 3"" working with millions of pixels and with feelings so large they take your breath away the filmmakers actually capture what it means to be alive. And then to literally face infinity and beyond.Thats quite a job for a bunch of playthings but never fear The studio that made ""Wall-E"" ""Up"" ""The Incredibles"" and a game-room full of other great movies never lets sentiment overwhelm the witty excitement and precision zoom-n- whir thats become the Pixar trademark.However while bittersweet melancholy has always hung over the ""Toy Story"" films this last time round contains something more. Viewers under 10 wont get the existential underpinnings until many years and viewings later. And then theyll likely choke up too.As Andy heads off to college Buzz (Tim Allen) and Jessie (Joan Cusack) along with Rex Hamm Barbie Slinky Dog and Mr. And Mrs. Potato Head are anticipating being put in the attic. Mistakenly donated to a day care they meet the disarmingly sweet strawberry-scented bear Lotso (as in Lots-O-Huggin voiced by Ned Beatty). Lotso it turns out is keeping the schools toys in line telling his right-hand plastic man Ken (Michael Keaton) to send them to the toddler room where the most slobberfilled damage occurs. (When Ken meets Barbie unpredictable results occur.)Wheres Woody? Having a parallel adventure since the pull-string cowboy (beautifully voice-acted again by Tom Hanks) was meant to go away with Andy but winds up blocks from home. Then a meeting with a kindergartener reminds Woody of what a toys life should be and he goes to save his pals.The crystalline 3-D adds to the eyepopping look and while most kids films dont know how to put their heart where their hi-tech is Pixars continued visual and emotional evolution is amazing to witness. Of course they dont just make movies for children; this one has references to Jean-Paul Sartre and ""Cool Hand Luke"" and a sophisticated structure with more twists than a Rubiks Cube.While the vocal performances of Hanks Allen and company make up a perfect ensemble and its visual leaps astound ""TS3s"" real power sneaks up on you. By the time its poetic ending arrives encapsulating the transformative continuing power of play we recognize that none of us move from one stage of life or beyond without help from our friends.

"DVD Reviews Toy Story 3 and Ladies amp; Gentlemen The Rolling Stones | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesDVD Reviews Toy Story 3 and Ladies amp; Gentlemen The Rolling StonesMovie critic Peter Howell reviews new DVD releases of Toy Story 3 and Ladies amp; Gentlemen The Rolling Stones.Toy Story 3 is out on DVD Tuesday.  (HANDOUT)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Oct. 28 2010Toy Story 3(Walt Disney)(out of 4)This Toy Story threequel is a movie for our Age of Anxiety a time much more unsettled than when Toy Story 2 came out in the comparatively idyllic pre-9/11 world of 1999. Even the toys realize it ""I hate all this uncertainty"" says kindly dino Rex (Wallace Shawn).Directed by series veteran Lee Unkrich its every bit as delightful as its predecessor but there are darker elements -- including a genuinely fearful villain -- that could frighten very young children.Article Continued BelowWritten in the main by Little Miss Sunshines Michael Arndt the film addresses issues of aging abandonment and loneliness with greater directness and clarity than in the previous two films.Time hasnt stood still in the real world and neither has it in the seemingly placid Elm St. home of toy-loving Andy (John Morris).Andy is now 18 and headed off to college a man who must put away the toys of his youth. He is planning to take with him only trusty cowboy Woody (Tom Hanks) leaving his ever-efficient Mom (Laurie Metcalf) to do whatever she wants with his other playthings.Woody and his plastic pals including Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) Hamm (John Ratzenberger) Jessie (Joan Cusack) Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head (Don Rickles and Estelle Harris) and Barbie (Jodi Benson) now face challenges both obvious (the garbage truck and recycling furnace) and hidden (a daycare called Sunnyside).Woody and his friends get a big hello from Sunnysides snuggable mascot Lots-OHuggin Bear (Ned Beatty) and from the resident jock doll Ken (Michael Keaton) who naturally would gravitate toward Barbie. But theres more than meets the wooden eye about Sunnyside where evil comes with the scent of strawberries.Toy Story 3 so successfully conjures up drama for Woody and his pals viewers of sensitive dispositions may choose to watch parts of the film through their fingers. Its that scary at times.Its also very funny (Keaton is a hoot). No cheap knockoff in dramatic terms either Toy Story 3 beautifully assesses how our sense of belonging to someone is so much a part of our happiness in life even if were only made of plastic.Extras are numerous especially on Blu-ray included a directors commentary making-of featurettes a peek at Cars 2 and the superlative short Day amp; Night.Peter HowellLadies amp; Gentlemen The Rolling Stones(Eagle Rock Entertainment)(out of 4)Just in time to accompany Keith Richards tell-all autobiography comes this long-shelved film of the Rolling Stones at their filthy best.Those accustomed to the Broadway-style productions and expanded band lineup of recent Stones show will marvel at the leanness of this 1972 tour chronicle which has previously been available on DVD only by bootleg.It shows the band as essentially the five-piece it was at the time Mick Jagger (vocals) Keith Richards (guitars) Charlie Watts (drums) Bill Wyman (bass) and Mick Taylor (guitars). There was sonic assistance from Bobby Keys (saxophones) Jim Price (horns) and Nicky Hopkins (piano) but its the front five who count here dominating a tiny stage that is free of the inflatables and pyro of later tours.The rawness of the production and relatively primitive 1970s recording technology dont always favor Jaggers vocals -- this was recorded mid-tour during a four-night Texas stand. You also miss the female back-up vocals of ""Gimme Shelter"" and ""Tumbling Dice"" as Jagger notes in a 2010 interview added to the disc.But this is the band at its legendary peek with ace axeman Mick Taylor firmly in command. The Stones were touring behind Exile On Main Street the album many fans consider the bands finest.Extras include tour rehearsals an Old Grey Whistle Test interview and a new Jagger interview.P.H.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Toy Story 3 brims with style confidence Pixar magic - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 3 starsToy Story 3 brims with style confidence Pixar magicJune 17 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticIf ""Toy Story 3"" had sprung Slinky Dog-like from any creative think tank besides Pixar Animation Studios it might be considered a classic. As is its a good sequel to the 1999 ""Toy Story 2"" and the 1995 original. After a rather shrill and conventional first half more in the DreamWorks style it recaptures the old comic spark with a splendid ode to ""The Great Escape"" as cowboy Woody spaceman Buzz Lightyear cowgirl Jessie Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head and the rest of the principals bust out of the plastic-and-plush-toy gulag in which they find themselves. Make no mistake This Disney/Pixar release represents a franchise taken seriously by its custodians. The guiding notion of the story picks up on a theme from ""Toy Story 2"" that of the existential conundrums faced by toys who know why theyre here (to please their owner) but who must worry about the bigger questions of life death and self-awareness just as humans do. Young Andy now 17 has long since sidelined his old pals. Hes heading off to college and the long-neglected toys are headed for the attic. Mistakenly theyre bagged and thrown to the curb as trash; screenwriter Michael Arndt (""Little Miss Sunshine"") belabors the complications that ultimately reroute the gang (minus Woody) to a day care center where the toys are led by a grandfatherly plush-toy a bear named Lotso (voiced by Ned Beatty) who welcomes the newcomers with open arms. What they find there is horror in the form of toddlers on a rampage. The film itself directed by Pixar veteran Lee Unkrich (co-director of ""Toy Story 2"" along with John Lasseter) offers its share of sheer terror as well. The perils some more inventive than others culminate in a fiery near-death experience for the ensemble (like the end of ""Titanic"" with flames instead of water) a sequence that may send very young viewers straight into therapy. Then again I thought ""The Lion King"" (Disney not Pixar) was too much for young kids as well. I come to ""Toy Story 3"" admiring the first two a great deal without quite cherishing either of them. Many millions of course do cherish them. For me its partly because the pictorial style of this series computer animation strikes me as antiseptic. Compared with the riches of all kinds in recent Pixar masterworks such as ""Ratatouille"" ""WallE"" and ""Up"" ""Toy Story 3"" looks and plays like an exceptionally slick and confident product as opposed to a magical blend of commerce and popular art. But the story finds itself around midpoint and by the end its combination of thrills and sentiment defies resistance. Tom Hanks Tim Allen Joan Cusack Wallace Shawn Don Rickles and the others return for some choice vocal characterizations. My favorite newcomers include the Chatter Telephone who serves an important communication function late in the game. In addition to Beattys cuddly bear (inspired casting even if the role itself deserved sharper writing) Michael Keaton is most welcome as the voice of Barbies petroleum-based soul mate Ken whose yen for fashion goes to infinity and beyond. The Pixar folks some of them at least clearly are ambivalent about the 3-D craze. Do you need to see ""Toy Story 3"" in 3-D? Not really. The films visual universe offers some of the things 3-D does best (flying sequences for one) but the filmmakers dont over-rely on the usual show-offy stuff designed to justify the 3-D admission markup. Though uneven and less witty than the first two ""Toy Story 3"" delivers quite enough in two dimensions. And theres a lovely coda in effect a curtain call for the characters we know so well. 3 stars MPAA rating G (all ages admitted) Voice cast Tom Hanks (Woody); Tim Allen (Buzz Lightyear); Joan Cusack (Jessie); Ned Beatty (Lotso); Don Rickles (Mr. Potato Head); Michael Keaton (Ken); Wallace Shawn (Rex); Jodi Benson (Barbie) Credits Directed by Lee Unkrich; written by Michael Arndt; produced by Darla K.

Toy Story 3 Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2010) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/toy-story-3-2010,200,toystory335,toystory3,rogerebert
Toy Story 3 (G) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Toy Story 3 (G) The third time is really a charmer. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald6/17/2010 Editor rating 3.5 In Toy Story 3 the wizards at Pixar Animation Studios dust off their most iconic characters for a spirited playful rumpus. The movie has a noticeably irreverent energy as if the filmmakers had decided to indulge themselves after cranking out so many masterpieces (Ratatouille WallE Up) and make something purely for sheer fun. And what great fun it is Eleven years after Toy Story 2 Woody (Tom Hanks) Buzz (Tim Allen) and the rest of Andys beloved toys are fretting about the boys having grown up. Andy preparing to leave for college is cleaning out his room. Will his childhood playthings get stored in the attic to collect dust? Will they be put out on the curb with the rest of the trash? The story hook of Toy Story 3 co-written by Michael Arndt (Little Miss Sunshine) is that Woody Buzz and the rest wind up being donated to a day-care center where manic toddlers smash them against walls and find out how far theyll stretch and bend. The concept is ingenious -- a playground as torture chamber -- and the movie essentially becomes a prison-break picture complete with an evil warden a pink teddy bear (Ned Beatty) who isnt as kind as he seems. Toy Story 3 which was directed by Lee Unkrich (Finding Nemo) introduces several other new characters including an amusingly vain Ken (Michael Keaton) who seduces Barbie (Jodi Benson) with his extensive wardrobe and a beat-up baby doll with a droopy eye that the movie occasionally uses to strike a note of fun cartoonish horror (new territory for Pixar). A surprising darkness lurks beneath the bright colors and vivid 3D animation -- this is really a story about aging and death -- although the subtexts are subtle and young viewers wont be disturbed. This is also the most hyperactive of all of Pixars films The entire second half is essentially one long action setpiece that keeps raising the cliffhanger stakes like an Indiana Jones picture. And the movie also has a taste for absurdist humor such as a long funny scene in which Buzzs inner machinery is reset to Spanish. That sequence like so much of Toy Story 3 is self-indulgent but irresistible -- a loving tribute to characters who have become engrained in the popular culture as deeply as Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny once did. And the movie saves its biggest wallop for the last scene a surprisingly moving depiction of the transition from childhood to young adulthood that will put a lump in the throat of many grown-up viewers. Even at their most playful the folks at Pixar know how to give any story emotional gravity and weight. Toy Story 3 is a worthy and delirious final chapter to this hallowed animation franchise.

"Toy Story 3 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; toy-story-3 ) Toy Story 3 (United States 2010) June 16 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Seen in standard (non-IMAX) 3-D. Pixar has done it again extending an amazing streak of successes that stretches all the way back to the original Toy Story which changed the face of feature length animation when it reached theaters in 1995. Now 15 years after their original debut and 11 years after the first sequel Toy Story 2 Woody (voice of Tom Hanks) Buzz (Tim Allen) and their fellow toys have returned to the screen for another adventure. Although aspects of Toy Story 3 echo similar elements from the previous films making this the least original entry in the trilogy the movies final act will resonate deeply with many viewers making this chapter in many ways the most heartfelt. Toy time has passed a little more slowly than real time but it moves forward nonetheless. When we last met Andy (John Morris) he was a kid. Now hes packing for college. What to do with those childhood playmates that have been relegated to a spot in an old chest Woody Buzz Jessie the Cowgirl (Joan Cusack) Mr. amp; Mrs. Potatohead (Don Rickles Estelle Harris) Rex the Dinosaur (Wallace Shawn) and Hamm the Piggybank (John Ratzenberger)? Andy decides to relegate them all to the attic except for his good friend Woody whos coming with him to college. But a snafu occurs and the toys (except Woody) are donated to a day care center. At first this seems like paradise a benevolent place with an endless group of children for playtime ruled over by a gentle pink teddy bear called Lotso (Ned Beatty). But theres a dark side to this sunny place the youngest kids whose idea of ""playing"" is banging smashing and doing other unspeakable things. Soon all Buzz and friends want is to re-join Woody on the outside but that proves to be more difficult than it sounds. The daycare center is locked down like a prison but when Woody learns of his friends predicament he organizes a jailbreak. The story which is simple enough in its essence affords opportunities for action (the Great Escape) comedy (Ken amp; Barbie Buzzs Spanish personality) and pathos. The ending which is surprisingly affecting will speak more deeply to adults than children. Those in the latter group will understand the importance of friendship but older viewers will perceive other bittersweet things the fleeting nature of childhood and how all things pass seemingly in the blink of an eye. Children are only peripherally aware of the passage of time but adults sometimes recognize little else. Theres a moment in Toy Story 3 when Andy experiences an epiphany that brings this all home. The scene which may go unnoticed by the core demographic will bring lumps to the throats and tears to the eyes of some parents. This is the kind of thing Pixar does so effectively and the reason why their films achieve greater respect than those of their less ambitious competitors. From a purely artistic standpoint Toy Story 3 is superior although not vastly so than its predecessors. At the time of their releases Toy Story and Toy Story 2 were cutting edge but the bar hasnt moved much in 11 years. The problem with this movie is the 3-D which is the ""preferred"" format for its screening. The bright rainbow of colors becomes murky and washed out with grays withering the kaleidoscope of hues. In addition the 3-D appears to have been employed as an afterthought - there are lengthy sequences in which it either isnt used or is used minimally. I was surprised to find I could take off the 3-D glasses and for stretches not be confounded by blurred or double images. In the case of Toy Story 3 3-D adds nothing except a box office surcharge. All the old favorites are back with voice actors slipping into their roles as if no time had passed. Even John Morris who played Andy as a child in the previous films has returned. The only missing cast member is Jim Varney who died in 2000; his part as the slinky dog is filled by Blake Clark. Newcomers to the Toy Story universe include Ned Beatty as Lotso and Michael Keaton as Ken. Jodi Benson (Ariel to her many fans) who had a small part in Toy Story 2 as Barbie sees her role expanded with the introduction of her plastic soul-mate. Some of the most amusing moments during the course of Toy Story 3 relate to the romance between Ken and Barbie. As with the best material in animated movies this works on two levels. With most franchises animated or otherwise the well has run dry by the time the third episode is under consideration which explains why so many second sequels fail to meet expectations. In a way the same may be true of Toy Story 3 but it doesnt strain to be different to the point where it loses sight of its strengths. Instead it focuses on the reasons for its popularity and amplifies those. Our familiarity with the characters and their interaction becomes an asset making the action scenes more than displays of pixels zipping across the screen. The writing shows a deftness of touch that provides Toy Story 3 with emotional depth. And director Lee Unkrich a Pixar fixture who co-directed Toy Story 2 (among other films) shows the same mastery of elements evident in the other Toy Story films allowing for a seamless continuity. Toy Story 3 enhances the legacy of its brand while providing exceptional entertainment value for viewers of all ages especially for those who favor the brighter livelier 2-D iteration over the 3-D gimmick.

Weve got Toy Story 3 ((c) Disney/Pixar) A Toy Story 3 Genre Animation; Starring Tim Allen Ned Beatty Tom Hanks Don Rickles Wallace Shawn; Director Lee Unkrich; Author Michael Arndt; Release Date Wide 06/18/2010; Runtime (in minutes) 102; MPAA Rating G; Distributor Walt Disney Productions Posted July 31 2012 -- 1200 AM EDT You wont be alone if you go to see Toy Story 3 with ginormous expectations. After 15 years the original Toy Story remains -- to me -- the most ticklish delightful and transporting of all Pixar films; its menagerie of innocently devoted jabbering bedroom toys has become as beloved a part of the American pop culture family as the Simpsons or the Seven Dwarfs. Walking into this second sequel I knew what I wanted to be carried away yet again by the antic charm of Woody the noble common-sense cowboy (voiced by Tom Hanks with his trademark acerbic snap) the irresistibly self-adoring action figure Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) the cranky Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) the mouse-that-roared dinosaur Rex (Wallace Shawn) the squeaky-cool alien LGMs and the rest of the gang. I yearned to be dazzled and touched by the speed and repartee and by action scenes that have a kiddie Indiana Jones ingenuity. I wasnt disappointed. Yet even with the bar raised high Toy Story 3 enchanted and moved me so deeply I was flabbergasted that a digitally animated comedy about plastic playthings could have this effect. Andy the boy owner of our toy pals is now all grown up and about to head off to college which leaves the toys feeling like relics. All they want is to be played with; thats how theyre made. Will they now be stowed in the attic -- a slightly depressing if still acceptable fate? Or will they (gulp) be thrown out? When Andys mom mistakes an attic-bound trash bag full of them for well garbage they end up being carted off to a day-care center. Upon arrival they meet a new batch of playthings who look like they belong on the Island of Misfit Toys. They also meet the stuffed animal who runs the place a drawling Lots-o-Huggin Bear named Lotso (Ned Beatty) who explains that they will now be played with every day by an eager crop of kids. It sounds a little too good to be true -- and it is. Besides theyll no longer be Andys toys. They know in their synthetic joints that theyre being put out to pasture and the awareness that they are not wanted creeps up on them and us like a giant swelling teardrop. All of a sudden a Pixar movie has the poignance of a Tennessee Williams play and that sense of fragility -- of once-loved now-outdated toys fighting for dignity and survival -- haunts the entire movie. Yet Toy Story 3 isnt soggy. Its as madly mischievous and inventive as Toy Story and its sequel from the mushroom cloud of a Barrel of Monkeys that caps the films Wild West fantasy prelude to the brilliantly skewed suspense sequences that transform the day-care center into the set for an elaborate childs-play version of a prison-escape thriller. (When a Fisher-Price Chatter Telephone started to talk like a film-noir informant I knew I was in movie heaven.) Toy Story 3 represents a virtuoso performance by the Pixar team led by director Lee Unkrich (the codirector of Toy Story 2 and Finding Nemo). I think its the studios greatest achievement since The Incredibles and -- just maybe -- since the original Toy Story. The beauty of the Toy Story films is their special two-tiered vantage. We experience most of the action from a toys-eye view. But were always reminded that theyre living in a much bigger universe than they know -- that theyre characters and objects at the same time. Thats why theyre never more winning or psychologically rich than when they flaunt their (deluded) egos. Buzz gets so full of himself this time that he turns into a Latin lover literally speaking Spanish when hes reprogrammed. Woodys tug of valor and vulnerability has never been more affecting and Lotso makes a memorable heavy exquisitely devious with a Dixie-senator courtliness and a backstory worthy of the Phantom of the Opera. If youre wondering where the fresh jokes are fear not. The movie has delirious fun with Big Baby a damaged infant doll whos a rubbery droopy-eyed zombie. And then theres Ken -- yes the Ken (voiced by Michael Keaton having a ball) whos a different sort of zombie a polyester-brained dandy who lives in a dollhouse and wishes that it were still hip to be square. Like every other toy in the film he comes with his own hilariously specific mental universe. Fifteen years after Toy Story its heroes look more old-fashioned and analog than ever. They really are relics in a world of techno gizmos. Yet all theyve ever wanted is a home and in the supremely moving final scenes of Toy Story 3 their simple desire to be played with is the furthest thing from selfish. It mirrors a childs own essential need to indulge her imagination through play. Toy Story 3 is a salute to the magic of making believe.

Toy Story 3 Good to great Director Lee Unkrich. Cast Tom Hanks Tim Allen Ned Beatty. Rating G. RELATED Toy Story and other movie trilogies The toys are back in town Spotlight Tom Hanks Disney/Pixar movies ""Toy Story"" established Pixar as not just another animation studio but a creator of real art for audiences of all ages every bit the equal of Disney in its creative heyday. ""Toy Story 2"" took the concept further exploring themes of friendship and betrayal (real or imagined; when you feel betrayed it doesnt really matter which). The first film was great the second maybe greater - its the ""Godfather"" vs. ""Godfather Part II"" argument for the preschool set. But continuing the story carries with it inherent dangers. You run the risk of besmirching your legacy. We all remember ""The Godfather Part III"" however much we try to forget. Happily that isnt the case with ""Toy Story 3"" another terrific film in the series. As good as the first two? Well thats another question. It had to happen Andy (voice of John Morris) has grown up. He has graduated from high school and is headed to college a destination not typically associated with a toy collection. So Woody (Tom Hanks) Buzz (Tim Allen) and the rest of the toys are understandably anxious about their future. As we learned in previous installments after all a toy isnt really fulfilled unless its played with. As first among equals Woody is in a somewhat better position than the rest. For them the choices seem limited to the attic or the trash. It quickly becomes clear that the attic with its possibilities of rediscovery (maybe even by Andys future children) is the best option. As it turns out theres another possibility. An honest mix-up leads to another world entirely day care. They arrive at the Sunnyside Daycare Center to a warm greeting from the toys already there. Toys here are played with every day. It seems too good to be true. And of course it is. The constant playing quickly turns into a careful-what-you-ask-for situation. More troubling something darker lies beneath the warm-and-fuzzy (and strawberry-scented) exterior of Lots-o-Huggin Bear (Ned Beatty) the leader of the day-care toys. Without giving too much away Woody Buzz and friends will have to rely on each other if they hope to escape what isnt the idyllic situation it seems at first to be. And if ""escape"" implies getting away from danger meaning an exploration of darker themes thats appropriate. The danger the toys find themselves in is real particularly late in the story. How they face it is one of the most satisfying and moving moments in the entire series. The film looks great using 3-D as a tool not a crutch. Much (though not all) of the old gang returns including Jesse (Joan Cusack) Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) and Hamm (John Ratzenberger). Among the new toys the most interesting is Ken (Michael Keaton) who of course lives in the Dream House has closets full of fabulous clothes and hits it off immediately with Barbie (Jodi Benson). But can you really trust a man in an ascot? Although the notion of day care as a sort of prison camp is intriguing and innovative the core theme explored in ""Toy Story 3"" is togetherness the power of friendship. But is it as good as the first two? In a word no. But thats just one word and it doesnt really explain things. Seen in a vacuum youd think ""Wow this is a great movie."" But you dont see it without the memories of the first two and their game-changing creativity. Perhaps thats an unfair burden but its no less true. ""Toy Story 3"" is very much a worthy entry in the series a movie well worth making (and seeing). It continues the legacy. It just doesnt expand upon it.

(Andy is off to college and his mom has broken out the Hefty bags.) But in the sternly orotund warning of one Mr. Pricklepants (ex-Bond Timothy Dalton) its ""a place of ruin and despair"" peopled with violent drooling tykes and ruled with a plush fist by Lots-o-Huggin Bear (the extraordinary Beatty) whose strawberry scent and harmonica-swaddled folksiness hide a sadist. Clearly Pixars genius for adventurous storytelling continues unabated; a prison film would seem to be the furthest idea from safe but the tale (by director Lee Unkrich John Lasseter and Wall-Es Andrew Stanton) poses a serious challenge to the old saw of terrible second sequels. As always the fun with this franchise comes from elaborate sequences of escape stressing the plastic resourceful nature of our heroes. This third chapter has some doozies especially the jaw-dropper where spy Mr. Potato Head slips out of his skin reassembling in the body of a floppy tortilla. (Watch out for that pesky pigeon though.) Why then are we not quite at the highest rank? Theres no avoiding the dark twinge of rejection that such a story inevitably courts; there are moments---the toys wandering through a dumps wasteland of fire and swirling trash---when you might be reminded of Steven Spielbergs depressing robot fantasia Artificial Intelligence. Still humanity shines through the brighter comic lines. ""Authority derives from the consent of the governed not by force"" shouts a small firm voice; her name is Barbie and even Ken is stunned.

""Toy Story 3"" is a gorgeous film -- funny sweet and clever in the tradition of the best Pixar movies -- but because it comes from that studios nearly flawless tradition including two ""Toy Story"" predecessors the expectations naturally are inflated. Excluding ""Cars"" Pixar has a perfect track record of animated classics with the innovative ""Toy Story"" starting it all in 1995. And so the pressures on to come up with a tale that makes a sequel worthwhile. The storytelling in no way is in question; it never is at Pixar which is the fundamental reason their films are so strong. Neither is the voice cast led once again by Tom Hanks Tim Allen and Joan Cusack with formidable newcomers like Ned Beatty thrown into the mix. The details are as vibrant and tactile as ever the textures and expressions the use of light angles and perspective. And the core concept -- that toys have a rich complex interior life when people arent around -- still holds up and resonates all these years later. If ""Toy Story"" hadnt come out in 1995 and ""Toy Story 2"" hadnt followed it in 1999 ""Toy Story 3"" would stand on its own as a breakthrough. Trouble is those earlier movies do exist. And by comparison this third installment doesnt feel quite so fresh. And then of course there is the 3-D -- the trend of the summer the thing that makes this ""Toy Story"" different from the first two. Its not intrusive. It doesnt consist of stuff being flung at you and plopped in your laps in gimmicky fashion. But as is so often the case its also completely unnecessary. Thats especially true with the kind of strong writing you have here. The script comes from Michael Arndt an Oscar-winner for ""Little Miss Sunshine"" based on a story by director Lee Unkrich Pixar chief John Lasseter and ""WALL-E"" director Andrew Stanton. The words and the characters pop off the screen just fine on their own. The premise is compelling Andy (voiced by John Morris) is no longer a kid playing all day in his room with Woody (Hanks) Buzz Lightyear (Allen) cowgirl Jessie (Cusack) and the rest. Hes heading off to college and as hes cleaning out his room he must decide what to do with his old friends. Mom (Laurie Metcalf) gives him two options stick them in a box for storage in the attic or throw them in a trash bag for the garbage men. The toys including the neurotic dinosaur Rex (Wallace Shawn) know-it-all piggy bank Hamm (John Ratzenberger) and wisecracking Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head (Don Rickles and Estelle Harris) are understandably freaked out by both prospects. Plus theyre just sad to see their friend go and have all the good times end. It raises the kind of deep existential question you dont often see in a kids movie If no one acknowledges you do you still exist? Through a couple of mix-ups (and some ""Mission Impossible""-style maneuvering) they wind up instead at a day care which seems awesome Kids play with you all day And new kids are constantly coming through so the toys will never be bored or lonely Its paradise -- until theyre placed in the room with all the wildly grabby toddlers rather than the older kids who play a little more gently. And the whole place is run with a firm fuzzy paw by Lots-o-Huggin Bear (the excellent Beatty) whos all Southern charm at first but is actually a Machiavellian tyrant. Hes like a pink strawberry-scented Tennessee Williams character. Among the other new cast members Timothy Dalton is a total scene-stealer as a hedgehog in leiderhosen named Mr. Pricklepants a preening British actor and Michael Keaton is perfect as pretty-boy Ken whos just as obsessed with clothes as Barbie (Jodi Benson) is. Its some of the best work Keatons done in years and a great reminder of how funny he can be. Unkrich who was a film editor on ""Toy Story"" and co-director on ""Toy Story 2"" plays the petite prison elements of the situation for tons of clever laughs. Theres also a beautiful sepia-toned flashback that explains the origin of Lotsos anger as well as the back story of his chief enforcer a creepy doll named Big Baby. But then ""Toy Story 3"" turns unusually dark as it heads toward its climax -- it might be too intense for littler kids -- before turning heavy-handedly sappy at the absolute end. Adults in the audience will undoubtedly shed a tear or two. But thats how good the folks at Pixar are They make you feel genuine emotions for hunks of plastic.

Andy outgrows his anthropomorphic amigos Buzz and Woody in ""Toy Story 3"" the franchises third (and final?) installment -- and as it turns out 15 years after launching the computer-animated toon revolution Pixar has outgrown them too. Whereas ""Toy Story 2"" treated auds to a character-based sequel that handily justified its existence this tertiary adventure delivers welcome yet nonessential fun landing well after its creators have grown up and succeeded toying with more sophisticated stories. Nevertheless the stereoscopic 3D release which reportedly out-tested all of Pixars previous efforts should dominate summer playdates. From the outset we can sense different hands at the reins. Like the original pic opens with 6-year-old Andy acting out wild narratives for Woody (Tom Hanks) Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and the gang -- only this time director Lee Unkrich (who came up through Pixars editorial department and handled co-helming duties on ""Toy Story 2"" ""Monsters Inc."" and ""Finding Nemo"") plunges us into Andys imagination which follows childhood logic but looks more like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie. Andys toys are fiercely loyal to their owner with such playtime being their raison detre (though the ""Toy Story"" movies have long hinged on a rather arbitrary notion of what qualifies as the healthy treatment of toys). Homevideos advance us through a dozen years disposing of Bo Peep and a few other key players along the way. Its gutsy to see Pixar stripping back its ensemble -- the Green Army Men effectively desert rather than be donated -- in contrast to the unwieldy ever-growing ensembles of most toon sequels (though Disney Consumer Products has plenty of new characters to be excited about). Now 18 Andy is packing up for college. Clearly oblivious to the Roundup gangs value he tosses all but Woody into a garbage bag which his mom mistakes for trash and takes out to the curb. So begins a convoluted adventure that leads the toys to Sunnyside Daycare Center which at first appears to be an improvement The toys havent been played with in ages and here theyll get daily attention. Plus theyll have plenty of new friends including ""Big Baby"" and a Dream House-dwelling Ken (Michael Keaton). But theres a dark side to Sunnyside which is overseen by a folksy strawberry-scented pink plush named Lots-o-Huggin Bear (Ned Beatty). ""Lotso"" lost his owner years ago and now he runs the place like a prison. Where the first two ""Toy Story"" installments served as rescue movies with characters nobly putting themselves in danger to save their friends from harm this one instead follows the jailbreak genre. Take a step back and the film seems to be about the idea of toys coming to terms with being outgrown by their owners -- however everyone but Woody seems perfectly fine with being donated at the outset (and Jessies song already addressed such abandonment issues quite poignantly in the second movie). As character arcs go this one doesnt seem particularly compelling Woody must convince the others to break out of Sunnyside and find their way back to Andys attic where they can wait until he needs them again -- as delusional thinking goes this tops even fresh-out-of-the-box Buzz Lightyears identity issues. Pixar has essentially set an impossible standard for itself having previously delivered the rare sequel that improves on the original then followed that up with a run of exceptional work. This latest script written by ""Little Miss Sunshines"" Michael Arndt from a story by John Lasseter Andrew Stanton and Unkrich feels more gag-driven than the studios previous efforts -- essentially borrowing a page from DreamWorks Animation chasing snappy humor over heart-on-their-sleeve sentimentality within a few months of DreamWorks going the Pixar route with the sincere storytelling of ""How to Train Your Dragon."" (Its worth remembering that former Disney CEO Michael Eisner once intended to make ""Toy Story 3"" sans Pixar involvement when relations between the two studios broke down in 2004.) The visuals look gorgeous as ever making classy use of 3D to enhance the drama while staying true to the original aesthetic. Humans are notably improved especially young Bonnie (Emily Hahn) who takes Woody home at one point and introduces him to the films most appealing new characters including Shakespearean hedgehog Mr. Pricklepants (Timothy Dalton whose perf amusingly suggests another level of split-personality delusion among toys) and scatterbrained triceratops Trixie (Kristen Schaal). The latter bodes well for Rexs romantic prospects which seem far better than Barbies since Keaton plays Ken as an effeminate closet case (imagine the outcry had Pixar attempted an equivalent racial caricature). But the pic wants laughs and its willing to dilute the respect Lasseter showed this borderline-absurd world to get them goosing auds with punchline-driven cutting pop-song montages and throwaway silliness. Surely kids could have done without the bathroom humor though much of the comedy takes the high road such as an inspired bit in which Buzz is accidentally switched to Spanish-language mode. But ""Toy Story 3"" is best when its being serious and the final 15-minute stretch -- from the moment the toys are dumped at a landfill through the tear-jerking finale -- pays off feelings auds invested 15 years ago. Still theres no reason these scenes couldnt have come 80 minutes earlier (had the toys not escaped their first brush with the garbage truck) which would have left room for the film to explore the curious ontology of being a toy after escaping such a near-death experience. Pic is preceded by Teddy Newtons visionary six-minute short ""Day and Night"" an invigorating blend of stereoscopic CG visuals and old-school hand-drawn animation. Set against a black background two characters serve as windows to opposite halves of the day their playfully layered dance of sound and spectacle suggesting exciting creative directions Pixar could explore in the future.
