Well it seems the bars been raised with the companys latest which not only retains the same level of quick-fire jokery as Ice Age but anchors it all to some of the most imaginative and impressively detailed computer-generated imagery ever produced. The film is set in a mechanical retro-future world inhabited entirely by robots. Its never explained how we got here but we do discover how every new generation is spawned. Rather quaintly (and in one of many comic references to our own world) prospective parents make babies by assembling them from kits. Ah 12 hours labour but it was worth it says Mrs Copperbottom (Dianne Wiest) to her enamelled dishwasher husband as the films hero is born. Cut to years later and Rodney (Ewan McGregor) has become a budding inventor whos itching to show his Wonderbot to soft-hearted corporate investor Bigweld (Mel Brooks). But on his arrival at Robot City (where he bumps into future pal Fender voiced in a predictably manic manner by Robin Williams) he discovers that his prospective financier has been sidelined by a suave megalomaniac with an eye on a profiteering scam involving upgrades. Revolt RevoltRobots is basically a coming-of-age pic but one that also addresses notions of capitalism consumerism greed individualism and all that. Granted it doesnt always connect with the emotions but its an absolute stunner to look at briskly paced cute and hilariously funny throughout.

"Robots | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; robots ) Robots (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Robots is every bit as visually engaging as the best of the Pixar (or Dreamworks) digitally animated fare. The landscapes are stunning the characters are intricately formed theres plenty of break-neck action and Robin Williams provides a helping of belly laughs. Despite these positive qualities Robots never seems more than passably entertaining. In fact it more often resembles the template for a video game (with the interactivity removed in theaters - no doubt that will be restored for the X-Box and PlayStation 2 discs) than a fully realized motion picture. It doesnt take long to uncover the culprit for Robots lack of inspiration. The pedestrian plot is aimed squarely at five-year olds. Screenwriters Lowell Ganz amp; Babaloo Mandel have never been known for their subtlety (even their best work - like Splash Parenthood and A League of Their Own - employs shameless manipulation). In Robots they beat the audience into senselessness with the films message. The only way a viewer could walk out of Robots not realizing the importance of following ones dream is if sleep overtook that audience member a few minutes into the film. This kind of approach is fine for children; adults will find it tiring. Leave it to Robin Williams to save the day. While his vocal performance isnt quite up to the standard he established in Aladdin its only a rung lower. It brings life and energy to Robots. Most of Williams dialogue has an improvisational quality to it - as if he was told the substance of his dialogue but was given carte blanche as far as word choice and delivery. The result is a sense of spontaneity. Were never quite sure what Williams animated alter-ego is going to say or do next. That element of the film will keep adults interested long after the storyline has shifted into autopilot. Unfortunately when it comes to vocal performances Williams is the only actor worth mentioning. None of his co stars - Ewan McGregor Halle Berry Drew Carrey Jim Broadbent Mel Brooks or Greg Kinnear - offer anything more memorable than a generic performance. They read their lines but dont do more. Next to them Williams seems fresher than he might in more favorable circumstances. The story is familiar fairy-tale stuff a boy leaves home to pursue his dreams and ends up doing great deeds. Its Pinocchio crossed with The Wizard of Oz. In this case the boy happens to be a robot named Rodney Copperbottom (voice of McGregor) an ""outmode"" (older less streamlined model) who leaves the sleepy hamlet of Rivet Town for the metropolis of Robot City. His goal is to seek out Bigweld (Mel Brooks) his hero. But when he arrives Rodney learns that Bigweld has disappeared and things are being run by the sleek vain Phineas T. Ratchet (Greg Kinnear) and his evil mother the spider-like Madame Gasket (Jim Broadbent). Those two unsavory robots are pursuing a Hitler-esque plot of eliminating all outmodes so that the surviving population of ""upgrades"" looks a lot like Ratchet (the underlying reasons have more to do with greed than ethnic cleansing however). With the help of some new friends including the irrepressible Fender (Williams) and the obligatory love interest Cappy (Halle Berry) Rodney sets out to find Bigweld and rescue the city from the clutches of Ratchet. If the plot doesnt grab you the look of the film will. Directors Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha who were in charge for Ice Age (to-date the least impressive of the digitally animated features) have fashioned a robot world to stir the imagination. With sets looking like a wild hybrid of early Amazing Stories cover illustrations and erector sets gone mad Robots amps up the eye candy factor to an astonishing level. Each of the robots is unique and clearly not designed using the ""form follows function"" rule. (Many appear to have been inspired by the Star Wars droids.) Gaudy colors run riot. Rube Goldberg contraptions abound showing up everywhere from the citys transportation system to the domino games in Bigwelds abode. The ooh/aah factor is greater in Robots than in many of its digitally animated kin but that only partially compensates for the hollowness of the story and the lifelessness of all but one of the characters. The movie is peppered with content guaranteed to guard against the encroachment of boredom for those with short attention spans. An action sequence intervenes about every five-to-ten minutes (most of which feel like animated roller coaster rides). There are plenty of pop culture throw-ins like James Earl Jones voice intoning ""The Force is strong with this one."" (For those seven words Jones earns a spot in the opening credits.) And of course theres the humor. 90% of this comes from Williams (and a few lines are off-color although the innuendo will go over the heads of most young viewers) but there are also things like the mandatory staple of child-centered movies the fart joke. And many gags come at the expense of the character named ""Aunt Fanny."" If you have kids theres little chance that youll escape seeing this movie and when you go youll probably enjoy yourself. But Robots is not one of those dont-miss animated digital movies that works as well for adults as for children. The journeys of Shrek and the adventure of The Incredibles (to name but two) put Robots to shame. This is passable disposable spring entertainment and welcome more because of the paucity of family-friendly films currently available in theaters. Robots is more than a load of spare parts but there are some sprockets and rivets missing.

This adult joke will surely be lost on the kids in the audience. But theyll be too busy enjoying the rest of this bright computer-animated movie which takes them into a fantasy world of robots of every shape and size. In this movie ""having a baby"" means ordering an assembly kit full of tin plates springs and other doodads and putting together your new child yourself. Thats exactly what robot mom-to-be Mrs. Copperbottom (voice of Dianne Wiest) and her husband (Stanley Tucci) do for their new creation Rodney. _____More in Movies_____  Robots National Showtimes  Movie Trailers  Current Movie Openings  Arts amp; Living Movies _____Desson Thomson_____  More Reviews  Live Online Behind the Screen  Arts amp; Living Movies Free E-mail Newsletters Washington Entertainment GuideSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now MoviesSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now TravelSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now At HomeSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now ""Only 12 hours of labor"" sighs Mrs. C as they admire their metallic newborn. ""But it was worth it."" Yes it was it turns out. Rodney (voice of Crawford Wilson and later Ewan McGregor) grows up to be a brave resourceful hero a budding inventor with aspirations to put together new robots out of old parts. His first invention is Wonderbot a hovering device with eyes and hands that can wash dry and put away dishes many times faster than his father who had himself refitted to be a dishwasher. Determined to make something of himself Rodney heads for Robot City. ""If you can make it here you can make it anywhere"" says a red tin hustler named Fender (Robin Williams). ""But if you cant join the club."" But in this ever-modernizing world reconditioned robots -- known as outmodes -- are rapidly obsolete. Rodneys dream to make new life out of old junk puts him at moral odds with the dastardly industrialist-controller Phineas T. Ratchet (Greg Kinnear) who plans to turn everyone into a revamped and of course expensive model. His company slogan is unequivocal ""Why be you when you can be new?"" (A metaphor for our materialistic world? Oh surely not.) ""Robots"" directed by Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha moves along at an entertaining if increasingly familiar clip. Following the lead of such other computer-animated hits as ""Shrek"" ""Monsters Inc."" and ""Ice Age"" it goes through all the requisite motions. That means for instance rolling out every conceivable pun verbal or visual to do with its subject. (""My dream"" declares one robot student in a school yearbook ""is to end world rust."") It also means taking us on vicarious thrill rides whenever possible. Rodney and Fender (who becomes his guide) take their share of uphill-and-down-dale helter-skelter rides through Robot Citys automated landscape. And there are the always dependable one-liners from Williams. ""Inside you is a model waiting to throw up"" he chatters manically as Fender takes feverish snapshots of Rodney trying to con him into paying big money for a photograph. Fender even does a ""Singin in the Rain"" routine except its a more robotic theme ""Ahm singin in da oil."" The comedians jillionth appearance in an animated feature completes the feeling of sameness and familiarity for sure. But it also amounts to dependability for audiences simply looking for easy entertainment and some neat-looking robots along the way. ROBOTS (PG 91 minutes) -- Contains some slightly risque sexual humor and bathroom gags. Area theaters.

Thats because its made of nuts and bolts belts and links gizmos and gewgaws pins and screws all bathed in a soothing lube of WD-40 or possibly simple lithium grease. Thats the world of ""Robots"" a kids movie that should delight everyone except the screwdriver-challenged or the story-nostalgic. As a piece of production design ""Robots"" is the aces. It begins with a delirious concept a human-free world of machines but not so much a Tomorrowland as a Yesterdayland specifically a 1939land. In other words the machines havent descended from the machines of today with their bland plastic hulls their nanocircuitry and digitalization their mysterious software. Fender right exemplifies the throwback style of robot embraced by computer animator Chris Wedge as he designed his dynamic ""Robots.""

Its central unexamined premise is something like this All life has descended from a Supreme Being who has a strange resemblance to the Tin Man. Yes that Tin Man steam-driven with a funnel for a hat and a riveted jaw and alas no heart; it seems he created the world in six days saw that it was good and created everything else on the seventh that is more Tin Men. More and more Tin Men and as they replicated they deviated they specialized they mutated until the world of ""Robots"" was birthed and you could say sincerely ""I have a feeling were not in Kansas anymore."" Thus the ever-fascinating spectacle of ""Robots"" as created by the computer wizard Chris Wedge of ""Ice Age"" fame a mechanical universe rooted firmly in the pre-computerized engineering of 1939 (when ""The Wizard of Oz"" came out). Steam seems to be the power modality and hydraulics still the principle of movement. Lubrication is the essence of life oil the elixir; nothing like pouring a nice cocktail of petrochemical extract to end the day and sitting around drinking it neat or on the rocks with some of your fellow chitty-chitty-bang-bangers. The Little Engine That Could would be right at home in this land of anthropomorphized machinery as would the mechanical rabbit from any greyhound track. This is the somewhere over the rainbow where even the humblest can opener has a soul wishes hopes and dreams and a paint job usually peeling. Theres so much to see in ""Robots"" and plenty of time to see it because the story wont preoccupy you and the characters have the personalities of toasters. Cleverness for its own sake is still cleverness Perhaps the dizziest ride in the film takes place when our hero Rodney first gets to the Big Town -- Robot City this Gotham is called -- and steps aboard a public transportation system that appears to be based on a pinball machine fused with a Tilt-a-Whirl. Its all spinning gears spronging arms stunning feats of timing and flying as Rodney and his new pal Fender spin through the air in some kind of ball-like vehicle that bounces plunges is captured as it hurtles through guts of gears and cams slides and chutes and finally comes to rest perfectly captured at its destination. The ingenuity goes on and on Every machine is a fantabulation of valves and pipes and treads with magical mechanical possibilities. One fellow is part dishwashing machine; theres a street sweeper that looks like a giant threshing machine crossed with a Sherman tank. Theres even a hellish chamber where worn-out machines are sent to die. Its one of those conveyor belt-dominated plants where the tin elderly are disposed of in the maw of a furnace spewing orange tendrils of napalm. Wahhhhhh. It was scary. Me want mamas bosom in which to hide but my the strange woman sitting next to me got soooo huffy Like wheres the love? Anyhow as miraculous as the setting is and the realization of Wedges vision the story fails to really engage on any level save the kinetic. The narrative seems ripped not from L. Frank Baum but from Case No. 243-A/II at Harvard Business School. The issues in play are Detroit-style planned obsolescence vs. Havana-style perpetual repair. Naturally Big Business prefers the previous for the new upgrade units increase profits; naturally the girl and boy common-man bots prefer the latter because they want to retain their essential identities even if theyre washing machines. Into this little-guy/big-biz malaise comes Rodney a dreamer from the sticks (way out in Rivet Town). Hes come to the big city because he feels some powerful need Gotta invent gotta invent. But the kid thinks itll be easy. You just go to Mr. Big Welds plant and he makes you a star. What he doesnt realize is that Big Weld has retired and the evil Phineas T. Ratchet has taken over and is pushing the planned-obsolescence campaign forward. If he has his way all the bots will be like new model cars replaced every year. Okay lets take a deep breath now. Are we really watching a movie about can openers with souls who worry about going to can opener retirement villages and living on can opener social security? Yes it appears we are and if it could be worse it could be better. For one thing see one machine and maybe youve seen them all. Wedge and his crew of technicals labor mightily to give each pile of nuts and bolts a distinct personality style of movement and physical identity but it all comes up pretty much a wash. The actors dont really help keep the parts in their separate bins. Rodney is read in too high a pitch by Ewan McGregor his girlfriend by Halle Berry the evil industrialist by Greg Kinnear. In lesser parts are Mel Brooks Drew Carey and Amanda Bynes. All fail to register. Only Robin Williams as Fender makes an impression because his line readings are so Robin-Williamsesque in that patented stream-of-consciousness methodology. Hes always funny always outrageous always Robin Williams. And hes the only human thing in ""Robots."" Robots (95 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for some suggestive humor.

Hughley Conan OBrien and Amanda Bynes. But too much reliance is placed on their star power and not enough on an interesting and fresh idea. Rodney Copperbottom (voice of Ewan McGregor) and Fender (Robin Williams) team up in Robots to fight evil at Big Weld headquarters. 20th Century Fox/Blue Sky Studios Robots chronicles the adventures of Rodney Copperbottom (Ewan McGregor) an engaging young bot on a mission to foil a plan to junk outmoded robots. Written by the veteran comedy writing team of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel (70s sitcoms Laverne amp; Shirley and Happy Days and the movies City Slickers and Parenthood) the movies one-liners are sometimes funny other times flat. Williams plays the scrappy scavenger Fender who befriends Rodney and the movies best jokes are his ad-libs and stream-of-consciousness patter but even those have a desperate quality at times. Robots visuals are its finest asset. The world populated exclusively by robots is an intriguing blend of the retro and the futuristic that often is dazzling particularly on IMAX screens where the movies also showing. But the innovative look is undercut by the predictable story and a drawn-out overblown ending. About the movie Robots   1/2 (out of four) Stars Ewan McGregor Halle Berry Greg Kinnear Robin Williams Mel Brooks Jim Broadbent Amanda Bynes Director Carlos Saldanha and Chris Wedge Distributor Twentieth Century Fox Rated PG for some brief language and suggestive humor Opens Friday nationwide Rodney is from a poor but loving family and his shabby parts are in constant need of replacing. He learns to live good-naturedly with hand-me-downs -- though it is a bit disconcerting when he gets his female cousins torso during his high school years. Rodney dreams of making the world a better place and he develops a talent for innovation. Hes convinced that one of his inventions can be marketed to Big Welds (Brooks) huge conglomerate. He also hopes to meet the master inventor himself. Rodney leaves his modest home in tiny Rivet Town which looks like a computer-generated version of Disneylands Toontown and treks to Robot City a Gotham-style megalopolis that is a feast for the eyes. When he gets to Big Welds headquarters he learns that the evil Ratchet (Kinnear) spurred on by his even more malevolent mother Madame Gasket (Jim Broadbent) has forced out Big Weld and taken over the company. Ratchet also has dastardly plans to dismantle and replace all tarnished outmoded bots. Rodney joins forces with a group of rusty robots to fight Ratchet and restore order and fairness. The computer-generated animation from Blue Sky Studios which also made Ice Age is technically impressive particularly in a scene where a massive construction of dominos is upended and also during Rodney and Fenders floating roller-coaster entrance to the skyscraper-filled Robot City. And the contemporary music is great but the allusions to pop culture figures seem unnecessary. Do filmmakers fear kids might not go to a movie if there are no references to Britney Spears or extended fart jokes? If so they are grossly underestimating their audience. Kids and adults flocked to The Incredibles which had neither.

Image courtesy of Blue Sky Studios Its a bucket of bolts that rattles agreeably. Robots mingles brass laughs and yes Robin Williams. 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Robots Animated comedy. With the voices of Ewan McGregor Halle Berry Mel BrooksGreg Kinnear and Robin Williams. Directed by Chris Wedge. (Rated PG 91 minutes. At BayArea theaters.) For an animated movie accompanied by its own line of Burger King toys and sugary breakfast cereal ""Robots"" certainly provides a lot of Kafkaesque moments for the kiddies. Along with rapid-fire comedy and amazing visuals the makers of ""Ice Age"" have created a sometimes bleak new world where anthropomorphic machines scrounge through junk heaps to replace missing body parts and evil corporate leaders scheme to kill the poor. Adults and children who arent emotionally scarred by the flatulence jokes and robot-in-peril plot turns will find a lot to like about Blue Sky Studios latest feature film. The computer animation movie presents Robin Williams at his genie-in-the-bottle best and the backgrounds are layered with the kind of entertaining details that reward repeat viewings. But ""Robots"" never stays in the same gear for long and the abrupt shifts in tone kill the movies chances of becoming a classic. The first 20 minutes are deceptively bright and cheery with only a few sexual innuendos to break up the good-time kid-movie mood. And it becomes immediately apparent that Blue Sky executives didnt blow their ""Ice Age"" profits on Courvoisier high-priced female escorts and Krispy Kreme stock -- every penny seems to have gone into making the animation look better than ""Shrek"" and close to the Pixar standard. Related Stories Robots a bucket of bolts that rattles agreeably Rodney Copperbottom (Ewan McGregor) is born in the working-class suburb of an all-robot world. Literally the son of a dishwasher Rodney is also a bumbling-yet-promising inventor and heads to Robot City to find employment with a Wonka-like businessman named Bigweld (Mel Brooks perfectly cast). Instead he finds Ratchet (Greg Kinnear) running the company like Pol Pot would run an HMO with diabolical plans to force expensive upgrades on those who can afford them and turn the lowest robot castes into scrap. Along with a manic hustler named Fender (Williams) and several other characters Rodney must lead the rusting masses against their oppressors. Theres nothing wrong with the current trend of PG-rated animated movies aimed at older children and adults even if it means the tiniest family members cant share in the fun. Most 3-year-olds probably dont care if theyre watching a new computer-generated film or the same creepy ""Thomas the Tank Engine"" video theyve seen 148 times before. But unlike ""The Incredibles"" which didnt waver from its mature animated action movie tone ""Robots"" never settles on a mood. While parts of the world are as shiny and kinetic and harmless as the inside of a new pinball machine there are darker interludes that dont match the cutesy characters -- imagine Kermit and Miss Piggy starring in ""The Muppets Grapes of Wrath."" If Randy Newman or Phil Collins were ever connected with this project they were swallowed whole by the robot-eating furnace in the movie and a scary Tom Waits song showed up instead. There are about five too many characters in ""Robots"" a movie where even the sidekicks seem to have sidekicks. Wasting the most space is Halle Berry who against all odds found a role thats even more nondimensional than her Storm character from ""X-Men."" Thankfully a lot more air time is devoted to Williams whose Fender is one part blue genie from ""Aladdin"" one part Cosmo Kramer and one part coffee grinder -- without seeming like a retread of his earlier comedy. Less audible but no less valuable is ""Robots"" production designer William Joyce whose attention to genius little details (including the wind-up toy pigeons and Rube Goldberg-style transit system) does a lot to mask any story problems. Blue Sky gets more help than expected from screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel who are old enough to have written for ""Happy Days"" -- the modern version of coming up in the Catskills -- but take a hip approach to gags that succeed more than they falter particularly in the rousing finale. Ganz and Mandel also leave a lot for parents to explain on the ride home. A panhandler robot holds a sign that says ""Got Screwed"" while a male robot is told to ""grow some bolts."" And its both funny and shocking when one of Fenders buddies is caught in the middle of robot urination. ""This is my third oil change today"" the robot quips. ""Something is wrong with me."" All thats left is for Berry to flash her robot breasts and McGregor to drop some opium into a filthy toilet and luge into the plumbing the way he did in ""Trainspotting."" But if that happened what would they do for the sequel? -- Advisory This film contains some frightening scenes adult humor and a scary Tom Waits song.

Rated PG (mildly risque humor and bathroom jokes plus a visit to a hellish scrap-metal plant) Were living in a golden age of animation and ""Robots"" is 24-karat stuff even if it has a soul of tin. With the voices of Ewan McGregor Robin Williams and Mel Brooks ""Robots"" is a giddy erector-set update of ""Toy Story"" with a splash of ""The Wizard of Oz."" The sophistication of its humor is at the level of ""The Simpsons"" and the computer animation is a wonder down to every scratch and screw. Director Chris Wedge (""Ice Age"") imagines his robots as lovably battered old rust-pots straight out of an Eisenhower-era toy box with chipping paint welding seams and appendages falling off at inconvenient moments. McGregor voices Rodney Copperbottom a bright young robot from a small town with a loving set of parents who stayed up all night making him -- from parts that arrived in a box. He travels to Robot City with hopes of presenting his dishwashing invention to the Oz-like hidden genius Bigweld (Brooks) chief of a robot-making corporation housed in an EPCOT-like giant ball. Rodney and his hyperactive hanger-on Fender (Robin Williams returning triumphantly to big-screen toons for the first time since ""Aladdin"") take a ride on a ramshackle mass transit system; when it socks passengers with a giant hammer many New Yorkers will have fond memories of the latest MTA fare hike. That clanging banging action sequence is one of many frenzied set pieces that will thrill the kids. The screen is wallpapered with sight gags A robot going through a metal detector has to take himself completely apart the symbols on restroom doors are a socket and a plug and nothing says morning like a hot fresh-brewed cup of grease. The bad guy is corporation man Phineas T. Ratchet (Greg Kinnear) a Kenny G-loving boardroom Terminator ruled by his monster mom (Jim Broadbent) a cross between Lady MacBeth and a trash compactor. The two of them have usurped Bigwelds powers and halted the production of spare parts so that existing robots will become doomed ""outmodes"" and the company can sell upgrades. Like ""The Incredibles"" ""Robots"" is all the funnier for taking fire at real-world targets; in this case every shill from plastic surgeons to Microsoft. Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel the unstoppable comedy-writing duo (18 movies including ""Splash"" and ""City Slickers"") were lured away from live action to write the script with playwright David Lindsay-Abaire. Now that three studios are hitting the animation jackpot is live action on its deathbed? Its a semi-serious question. The cartoon blockbusters have better action than the action movies and more laughs than the comedies possibly because Mr. Incredible doesnt demand script changes (or disappear into rehab). Is it a coincidence that sitcoms collapsed as ""The Simpsons"" was monopolizing TVs top comedy writers?

YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Robin Williams or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? (CNN) -- The eye-popping visuals of ""Robots"" swirl zing and ping right off the screen. Director Chris Wedge (""Ice Age"") and his talented team at Blue Sky Studios have created an entire world populated by robots of all shapes and sizes. Theyve also gathered an amazing group of talented actors to give voice to their unique creations.Unfortunately the script by David Lindsay-Abaire Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel -- while full of great gags and wonderful non-sequiturs -- isnt as creative as the inventive visuals.And while the film does manage to find some human emotion inside all the gears grease rivets and whistles overall it lacks the heart that was at the core of ""Ice Age.""The film begins with the arrival of Rodney Copperbottom (Ewan McGregor) who is delivered to his parents (Stanley Tucci and Dianne Wiest) in a cardboard box. The finally assembles their new baby boy after 12 hours of labor (get it?). As he grows older he gets replacement parts mostly second-hand.When he comes of age young Rodney grows tired of living in the confines of Rivet Town. He begins to dream of heading to the big time in Robot City and becoming an inventor like his hero the kind and wise Bigweld (Mel Brooks) who owns Bigweld Industries.Making his way in Robot CityRodney is dazzled by the multi-layered big city which is part amusement park part 1950s retro/art deco/futurist dream. He finally arrives at Bigweld Industries full of hope and optimism only to find that Bigweld has disappeared and a tyrannical corporate shark Ratchet (Greg Kinnear) has taken over.Backed by his evil mother Madame Gasket (a cleverly cast Jim Broadbent) who owns a robot chop shop Ratchet is determined to rid the world of all outdated robots by refusing to provide new parts. He believes in rampant consumerism and is determined to change the robot world into his vision where everything is new shiny and expensive. The conniving Ratchet (Greg Kinnear) has nasty plans for Robot City.He sends poor Rodney -- with his old-fashioned robot body -- packing but not before Copperbottom catches the eye of a slick female robot Cappy (Halle Berry). With his dreams shattered Rodney falls in with a group of other old-model robots known as Rusties living on the edge of society.This motley crew includes Fender (an out-of-control Robin Williams) who is constantly dropping body parts at the most inopportune moments; Fenders tomboy little sister Piper Pinwheeler (Amanda Bynes); and Crank Casey (Drew Carey). Theyve all taken shelter with Aunt Fanny (Jennifer Coolidge) whose big heart is only over shadowed by her extremely large rear end (get it? OK Ill stop now).Bonded by their mutual need for replacement parts the group - now joined by Cappy who cant resist Rodneys boyish charms -- sets out to find Bigweld and stop the nefarious plans of Ratchet and Madame Gasket.Script doesnt keep upVisually the film is astounding. The computer-generated animation is detailed and lifelike (well as lifelike as robots can get) and the colorful images (the robots themselves the crazily majestic look of Robot City) outdo each other for spectacle.But the script is rather pedestrian. Its missing the zing of the images or the emotion of ""Ice Age"" (or almost any Pixar film).Fortunately the vocal performances are all first-rate and parents will enjoy some of the films sly humor and visual puns.Children should enjoy it without reservation. After all in addition to the mind-boggling look of its mechanical characters the film manages somehow to include a few fart jokes de rigueur for a family film nowadays.""Robots"" is rated PG.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

Toy Story the feature-length debut of the form ushered us into a magical realm by mirroring the glossy synthetic sheen of plastic playthings and Ice Age with its zigzag-cracked glaciers was a winter-world fantasy as tactile as a virtual-reality ride. In a similar spirit Robots the second film from the Ice Age team is all about the metal. In this zippy enjoyable sci-fi slapstick jamboree the main characters arent sleek and shiny digital droids. Theyre nuts-and-bolts contraptions that look as if theyd been put together by a deranged mechanic working with whatever he happened to find on his garage floor. Early on Rodney Copperbottom (Ewan McGregor) the gee-whiz hero isnt born exactly. Hes built like an appliance assembled right out of the box by his parents. Rodney who grows bigger but still looks like he was made out of several old vacuum cleaners leaves home to seek his fortune as an inventor in Robot City which is like a Shanghai Oz designed by Frank Gehry entirely out of gleaming alloys. There he befriends a group of misfit robots who might have been banged together out of even scrappier Erector sets than he was. Fender (Robin Williams) their motormouth leader has a head like an ancient steam whistle and Piper Pinwheeler (Amanda Bynes) tosses pigtails that look like twin discarded light fixtures. Theres a bot with break-dance moves as smooth as his body is chunky and one with a torso like a car radiator grill. Most of the characters in Robots have at least a few screws loose -- literally. These walking talking piles of junk dont look or feel like the pop-fantasy robots of the 50s that heyday of technological optimism. If anything their designs harken back to the clunkier more primitive shapes of the 40s when the dream of mechanized middle-class living was still in embryonic form. Watching them you feel as if you could reach out and touch their rivets and mechanical eyebrows their ancient sprockets and corroded paint jobs. Robots is a high-tech marvel of low-tech love. The fluky charm of its chop-shop aesthetic is the embodiment of its theme which is that individuality in robots is a good thing even if its being stamped out by the evil Ratchet (Greg Kinnear) a towering corporate mamas boy with a pinstripe-suit torso conjoined to his head which is composed of razory layered symmetrical plates. He represents the new world of impersonal fascist design and hes behind a plot to trash the ""outmodes"" by denying them the spare parts they need. Robots is a fable of old-school values under siege The bots war for access to those spare parts could almost be a commentary on our health-care system and Ratchet and his cronies who look about as organic as tinsel Christmas trees are like the metallurgic products of cosmetic-surgery ""perfection."" (Ratchets mother who resembles a Jabba the Hutt built out of moving wrenches makes it clear he must have had a makeover.) Robots is crammed with madcap detail. There are terrific bits like the ingenious (and utterly nonsensical) Rube Goldberg ride that Fender and Rodney take in a spherical public-transport cage or the ritual drinking of morning ""coffee"" (i.e. hot grease poured over a robots body). Mel Brooks is the voice of Bigweld the famous inventor whose company has been taken over by Ratchet and the animators wed Brooks raspy grandpa-mensch delivery to the vision of a giant silver art deco Pac-Man that rolls into rooms. Overall however the visual comedy isnt nearly as unhinged as it might be. Considering the playful funkiness of its images Robots is too rote and square in the script department. Robin Williams doing his first voice in an animated feature since the ADD genie of Aladdin (1992) makes Fender a likable enough sidekick but the actor disappointingly spends most of the film in second gear. As appealing as it is Robots lacks the stoned crackpot wit of say Shrek 2 or The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie not to mention the virtuosic dazzle of The Incredibles. Yet the movie bops along with a happy jumping kinetic vitality. Is it a coincidence that R2-D2 looks as if he would fit right in with the misfit bots? Robots has visual motifs that echo back through the entire history of robots from the Tin Man to the jerry-built cutups of MST3K. For adults its part of the movies fun to make those nostalgic connections. And also to realize that yesterdays mechanical man of the future has become for kids todays mascot of the past.

Fox and Blue Sky Studios follow up their 2002 smash ""Ice Age"" with an even more vividly precise and inventively realized 3-D CGI package that should easily match and likely surpass previous pics 176 million domestic gross. Despite a script with more second-hand parts than many of its title characters ""Robots"" inspires sufficient wonderment to impress as spectacle and generates enough guffaws to score with every aud segment except the most toon-averse teens. Fox and Blue Sky Studios follow up their 2002 smash ""Ice Age"" with an even more vividly precise and inventively realized 3-D CGI package that should easily match and likely surpass previous pics 176 million domestic gross. (Day-and-date release of Imax version certainly will boost B.O. numbers.) Overseas and homevid biz will be nothing short of turbocharged. Working from concepts and character designs he initially hatched with William Joyce author of popular childrens books who gets producer and production designer credits helmer Chris Wedge leads an army of CGI wizards in the remarkably detailed rendering of a planet inhabited entirely by mechanical creatures. In the world according to ""Robots"" immense cityscapes appear co-designed by Fritz Lang and Rube Goldberg incorporating everything from art deco to futurism 30 kitchen appliances to 50s auto tailfins. Multitudes of mechanicals are balkanized according to class divisions are maintained in multilevel urban environments and public-transportation systems resemble super-sized pinball machines. Trouble is the narrative that drives the colorful characters through this eye-popping wonderland is something short of piping-hot fresh. To be sure the scenario credited to playwright David Lindsay-Abaire and vet scripters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel is serviceable enough as excuse to leap from one visually dazzling scene to the next. But even youngsters will experience a distracting sense of deja vu as familiar plot conflicts and stock characterizations loom large in this brave new world. Overall feeling of ""been there heard that"" is reinforced by Robin Williams typically motor-mouth antics while voicing a key supporting robot. Rodney Copperbottom (voiced by Ewan McGregor) a callow young bot from the boondocks of Rivet Town journeys to the vast metropolis of Robot City to find work as an inventor at Bigweld Industries. Unfortunately Rodney arrives in Robot City just as Ratchet (Greg Kinnear) a corporate mecha-shark replaces beloved old Bigweld (Mel Brooks) as company chief. To maximize profits Ratchet institutes a program to cease manufacturing replacement parts forcing worn-out robots to buy overpriced upgrade bodies. (New Bigweld ad slogan ""Why be you when you can be new?"") Unfortunately this means aging bots who cant afford upgrades -- like Rodneys father Herb Copperbottom (Stanley Tucci) a dishwasher (yes a real dishwasher) back in Rivet Town -- ultimately will be consigned to scrap heaps. But thats perfectly OK with Ratchet His malevolent old mother Madame Gasket (Jim Broadbent) runs an underground ""chop shop"" where obsolete and/or unrepairable robots are ripped apart and melted down. Naturally unassuming Rodney winds up leading a revolution against Ratchets chicanery. In this he receives help from such unlikely allies as Cappy (Halle Berry) a sleek yet scrappy Bigweld exec who rebuffs Ratchets unwanted advances; Piper (Amanda Bynes) a peppy girl-bot with pigtails shaped like shower heads; Fender (Williams) Pipers older brother a hyperkinetic hustler whos constantly scrounging to find replacement parts for himself and others; Aunt Fanny (Jennifer Coolidge) a motherly bot with an immense bottom; and silent Diesel whose search for a voice box cues a forceful cameo voicing by James Earl Jones. (Similar cameo vocals are provided by Terry Bradshaw Dan Hedaya Jay Leno Al Roker Stephen Tobolowsky and Harland Williams.) Its meant as high praise to say that very early in ""Robots"" the extraordinary starts to seem perfectly ordinary. That is Wedge and his artist-technicians do such a wondrous job of creating and sustaining the illusion of a matter-of-factly amazing world populated with meticulously detailed robots (complete with chipped paint unsightly dents and other signs of wear and tear) that its astonishingly easy for aud to quickly accept everything onscreen as if not reality then a persuasive facsimile thereof. Just as ""The Incredibles"" struck many as a rousingly exciting action-comedy that just happened to be an animated feature ""Robots"" often achieves the dramatic and emotional impact of the very best live-action sci-fi adventures. Vocal perfs are first-rate across the board from McGregors engaging earnestness as Rodney (whose head resembles a cross between an outboard motor and a faux-retro toaster) to Brooks robust bombast as the roly-poly Bigweld. And even though much of Williams shtick sounds recycled from his vocals for ""FernGully The Last Rainforest"" and Disneys ""Aladdin"" franchise hes undeniably delightful as he cuts loose with riffs on Japanese anime pop-tart musicvideos and best of all the glorious ""Singin in the Rain."" Climactic clash between good and evil feels more chaotic than comedic but laughs come frequently even during frenetic folderol. Pic overall abounds with clever in-jokey references to other movies -- note the guest appearance by a character from somewhere over the rainbow -- and other instances of sophisticated wit. On the other hand pic also includes ample dose of humor aimed at moppet level. Indeed even though ""Robots"" is about mechanical creatures you can rest assured filmmakers find ways to include fart jokes.
