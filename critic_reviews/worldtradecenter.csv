One minute its pure horror; the next its so daft and sappy that its laughable not least when the hallucinations of a semi-conscious policeman buried in the rubble of the collapsed World Trade Center threaten to evoke the LSD scenes in Stones The Doors. The events of 9/11 were told highlighted the goodness that we forgot could exist which alludes to the heroism of John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena) two policemen who entered the towers were pulled alive from the rubble and whose testimonies inform the film. Ten minutes in the first plane hits and the attack is depicted as an oversize shadow on the side of a skyscraper. But its sound not image that has the most impact creaks and groans crashes and thumps. Much time is spent within the tangled mess of the collapsed towers where the camera stays close to the faces of Cage and Pena. Their dialogue is of the tell-my-wife-I-love-her dont-you-dare-die variety which is credible if barely interesting. Beckett its not. The real banal soppy stuff takes place outside and with the policemens waiting worried families.World Trade Center is horrific and rousing and exactly as expected from a film that never threatened to be anything other than the first unchallenging reaction to 9/11 from Hollywood. It exists as the catalyst to a mass purge. If Stone werent in charge someone else would have made an identikit film. Destiny pervades the project and anyone who expected Stone to toe anything other than the company line was gravely mistaken.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? But ""World Trade Center"" is not your typical Oliver Stone lalapalooza. Starring Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena as Sergeant John McLoughlin and rookie officer Will Jimeno respectively two real-life Port Authority cops trapped beneath Tower 2 it strenuously avoids controversy. Even ""War of the Worlds"" was more worldly. What little political content there is can most accurately be described as flag-waving. (The films distributor Paramount specifically targeted the right-wing punditocracy in its marketing efforts.) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Atypical though it may be ""World Trade Center"" nevertheless fits squarely into the ham-fisted Stone tradition. Its about ""big"" themes brought down to human scale and it mainlines intensity. Stone is an intensity freak - the joke around Hollywood used to be that he was the only person who ever went to Vietnam to cool out. What better arena for him than ground zero?The movie begins eerily with McLoughlin making his way in the predawn to the New York Port Authority where he briefs his officers for what appears to be a routine day. When news of the first plane strike is confirmed - the loud dismaying thump of the collision heard in midtown fills our ears - he swings his team into action.Of the five officers buried beneath slabs of concrete and twisted metal only McLoughlin and Jimeno survive as they wait 12 hours trapped about 15 feet apart for help to arrive. Gravely injured and unable to move or even see each other they talk about their jobs and families in order to stay awake - to stay sane. They figure that if one of them falls asleep both will die.About half of the movie is taken up with these two men entombed in the dark like players in a Samuel Beckett mindscape. Their flashbacks such as McLoughlins memory of teaching his boy how to use a saw have a honeyed quality as if they had been ordered up from a family album catalog.For the rest Stone working from a script by Andrea Berloff schematically intercuts scenes of the officers families as they struggle to comprehend what is happening.McLoughlins wife Donna (Maria Bello) refuses to accept the worst. Like many a hardened cops wife she has steeled herself to believe nothing that is not confirmed. By contrast Jimenos pregnant wife Allison (Maggie Gyllenhaal) her extended family in tow is distraught to the point of near panic.Stone also works in a number of rescue subplots the most prominent being the true story of Dave Karnes (Michael Shannon) an ex-marine from Connecticut who sees what is happening on television suits up and believing he is on a mission from God ventures into the rubble.Karnes is the only major character in the film who speaks of payback. America is ""going to need some good men to avenge this"" he says and in the end we learn that he subsequently reenlisted for two tours of duty in Iraq. The implication is left standing that Iraq was behind the attacks. In moments like these I dont think the film can accurately be called apolitical.In many ways ""World Trade Center"" could just as easily have been about trapped miners. Stone wants to celebrate what he sees as the innate dignity of the common man. He is saying that people like McLoughlin and Jimeno and the others really do exist in this world. They represent the best of humanity because their love for family and faith allowed them to survive. (At one point in the blackness Jimeno sees a shimmering vision of Jesus.) Luck according to this film had very little to do with why these men are alive.The good that human beings are capable of is the message of the movie and perhaps it is the message that most people will want to take away from a 9/11 drama at this point in history. This does not mean however that the film should get a free pass just for being on the right side of sentiment. In the movies terms the heroism of McLoughlin and Jimeno is indistinguishable from their faith and love of family. The sanctimony here is laid on a bit thick. One wonders if the other survivors of the World Trade Center horror - only 20 made it out of the rubble - would be able to pass spiritual muster in the same way. If not are they any less admirable?Despite my strong reservations ""World Trade Center"" is strongly acted and has sequences of undeniable power. At its best it shares with Stones finest work a feeling for the imminence of death and salvation.But in the end as with Paul Greengrasss ""United 93"" one cant really discuss it simply as a movie. Its a phenomenon a morale-booster a barometer an exorcism a convocation. Grade B+ World Trade Center is rated PG-13 for intense content disturbing images and language.

Starring Nicolas Cage Michael Pena Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal. Directed by Oliver Stone. (PG-13. 125 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Moments of realization are inherently dramatic. Thats why theres no such thing as a boring Sept. 11 story. Ask anyone what he or she did and thought that morning and the story youll hear will always be dramatic and interesting. Indeed what makes a Sept. 11 story even better than say an earthquake story or a Kennedy assassination story is that a Sept. 11 story has five distinct moments of realization (1) hearing about the first tower (2) hearing about the second tower (3) hearing about the Pentagon (4) seeing the collapse of the first tower (5) seeing the collapse of the second tower. If this sounds like a cold approach to the discussion of a national tragedy please remember that the subject here is drama not the tragedy itself. ""World Trade Center"" is director Oliver Stones attempt to fashion drama out of that tragedy and the result is a sober responsible film that at times evokes not only the feelings of that day but also the mythic quality it has since acquired. Stone does everything he can to do justice to the real-life people hes depicting and yet nothing he does can cover up the films single but overarching weakness The personal story he uses to portray the larger event is limited in scope and impact. One would think that shouldnt have been the case. What could be more amazing than the story of two Port Authority police officers trapped under the rubble of the twin towers fighting to stay alive and to keep believing theyll be rescued? No question thats a remarkable story. Unfortunately its not a dramatic one. Looked at plainly what we get in ""World Trade Center"" is the story of two fellows who walk into a building and dont know what hit them. They have no idea the towers have collapsed and have little or no awareness that theyre victims of a terrorist strike. They spend three-quarters of the screen time covered in rubble unable to move. In story terms once the officers are pinned under the rubble the movie might as well be about a mine-shaft disaster. Theres the ordeal of the men inside and the increasing horror of their spouses and children a horror that spills out to their circle of friends and family. Stone renders this conscientiously even to the extent of replicating the cotton-mouthed blue-collar New York and New Jersey accents. Stone doesnt fail to remind us that this was something that happened to everyday people -- and yet it must be said Seeing actors who are anything but everyday people coming between us and the event with their actors craft and studied accents really does feel unseemly. It would be fine in a movie about a mine-shaft disaster but this was a national trauma. Just to be worthy of its title ""World Trade Center"" needed to provide (or come close to providing) a national catharsis. That it fails do so is probably because it doesnt take us through the tragedy step by step. It doesnt hit those dramatic touchstones mentioned earlier by which 300 million Americans came to realize they lived in a changed world. Obviously Stone couldnt have made a movie about Americans sitting around watching TV but there were better Sept. 11 stories out there -- for example that of David Lim a Port Authority cop who was rescuing people in Tower 1 with full knowledge of the collapse of the other tower. When Tower 1 came down on him he heard it coming and braced himself miraculously survived and climbed out to safety. Working with the story he had Stone does a fine job of blending the personal story with the larger story in the opening minutes. At 330 in the morning Port Authority Officer John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) gets up to go to work in Manhattan. Even on a good day this man does not have it easy. A little later Officer Will Jimeno (Michael Pena) leaves the house as the sun is rising and you can almost feel the cool humid air of a September morning. Stone cuts from them to shots of New York City waking up to what will be the worst day of its history. Its like the shots of Paris at the start of ""Love Me Tonight"" a far different sort of movie. At first the city is alone with itself and seems almost human and self-aware. Then slowly it loses its air of portentousness and self-consciousness in flurries of activity. Its in these early sequences that ""World Trade Center"" most seems like an Oliver Stone film. Thereafter his direction is restrained almost self-effacing and theres no political agenda. This is admirable though frankly I want a self-effacing Stone movie the way I want a modest Jerry Lewis. The first sign of the pictures limits -- and of the insurmountable limits of Andrea Berloffs screenplay -- comes as the tragedy begins. Stone drops the omniscient viewpoint that allowed for those dramatic morning shots of New York City and sticks slavishly to the perspective of the officers even though the officers perspective isnt all that interesting. After the collapse ""World Trade Center"" alternates between the guys under the rubble and their panic-stricken families interspersing static scenes with even more static reminiscences. Cage and Pena indicate a growing weakness but thats about all they can do with their roles. As the women Gyllenhaal and Bello swing from brave to flailing with fear and we almost believe them but not quite. Everyone tries hard in ""World Trade Center"" but somehow its all just a little too small and a little too Hollywood. -- Advisory This film contains disturbing images of destruction and death.

World Trade Center tells their story. John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) was one of two men rescued from the rubble on 9/11. World Trade Center tells their story. Photo Francois Duhamel Paramount Pictures World Trade Center a searing real-life drama 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The unthinkable has happened. Oliver Stone has made a film that is unrecognizable as an Oliver Stone film. Beyond a manifest passion for the material nothing about World Trade Center suggests Stone is its director. It boasts evidence of no outsize ego no conspiracy theories no virtuoso overkill no epic length. It displays optimism patriotism emotional frankness and faith. Detractors might call it sentimental. Most of all it exhibits no political slant whatsoever injecting only heartfelt empathy for the days many victims and heroes. Even its abiding masculine valor seems drawn from a deeper well of altruism -- something nobler than machismo something simpler perhaps than courage. Its the urge to do right. Its this urge that seems to motivate Stone who drained every last drop of auteurs bluster from this sincere and visceral tribute to the events of 9/11. Based on first-person accounts of the day it tells the true story of two first responders who were buried under the rubble when the towers fell veteran Port Authority cop John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and rookie William Jimeno (Michael Pena) whose harrowing subterranean entrapment forms the films central narrative. There are sojourns to the outside world -- families rescue efforts -- and flashbacks to the past as McLoughlin and Jimeno fade in and out of semiconscious reveries. For all the tragic enormity of the day World Trade Center is a resolutely small and inward film. The leads are filmed in shadows and up to their necks in debris turning an eye a mouth a cheek to the camera. And yet a searing drama unfolds simply and intimately drawing universal truths from the confided agonies of dying men. Cage has never been better Like Stone he seems to have stripped himself of affectation. Pena gives a wrenching star turn as the rookie Jimeno and the smaller character parts all bristle with idiosyncrasy; especially good are Michael Shannon as a steely ex-Marine and Stephen Dorff as a former medic two men who renewed themselves in the ruin of 9/11. As McLouglins and Jimenos wives Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal infuse stock roles -- the buttoned-up spouse and the distraught one respectively -- with note-perfect adjustments in psychic breakdown. Gyllenhaal could and should and (in a just world) will earn an Oscar nod for her work here. Unlike Paul Greengrass excellent temperate United 93 World Trade Center doesnt take a broad view of Sept. 11. It doesnt try to convey all the chaos just part of it using only those news clips and re-enactments (a Manhattan canyon is adrift with paper blanketed with ash) that give context to its characters. Some observers might question once more whether its ""too soon"" for a movie based on 9/11. Once more my response is no. Its not too soon any more than Back to Bataan was released too soon in 1945 four years after Pearl Harbor and three after the Bataan death march. Undeniably World Trade Center is tough to watch whether it shows a flailing body in descent or a grieving mother in a hospital. But the story it tells is worth repeating -- not just the attacks on American soil not just the evil that provoked them but the resounding humanity of every living soul who tried to help. All who remember 9/11 can recall both the horror of the day and the breathtaking epiphany that we were suddenly connected. As a victim says in the films reflective epilogue ""I saw a lot of good that day.""

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post The first thing to know is that there was laughter at a preview of Oliver Stones ""World Trade Center"" starring Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena as two Port Authority police officers trapped beneath what had been the World Trade Center. Yes there was sniffling and dabbing of tears. A number of folks at the Arvada Olde Town theater were first-responders. Still there were sporadic chuckles. These werent of the nervous variety. In the twisted wreckage that once was an elevator shaft near a bustling concourse of shops and subway entrances officers Will Jimeno and John McLoughlin share enough of their lives prior to the morning of Sept. 11 2001 to help audiences toward a smile. The two men do not know help is on the way. They hope it is. They do not know the worst of the news from above that both towers have fallen. On a bus careening toward lower Manhattan Port Authority Police Department officers trade news theyve heard - wed all started to hear - some of it accurate just as much wrong. Yet by relating anecdotes - and yes shouting in pain frustration and fear - McLoughlin and Jimeno keep each other awake a prerequisite to staying alive. They also provide a challenging solace for moviegoers. As we near the fifth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks McLoughlin and Jimenos story along with Paul Greengrass ""United 93"" (now on DVD) help mark where we are - and arent yet - in terms of those events. If controversy exists around ""World Trade Center"" its because no matter how many stories are told of that day others will go untold nuances will remain unexplored. ""World Trade Center"" approaches dramas potent promise finding in the story of two individuals and their families uncommon valor and common ground at ground zero. For depicting an events rippling effect through families ""World Trade Center"" recalls William Wylers ""The Best Years of Our Lives."" Not nearly as extraordinary as that 1946 film it is as caring. Directed with discipline by Stone from a script by Andrea Berloff ""World Trade Center"" has an agenda It intends to reconnect us to our better selves not our vengeful warrior or our too-comfy jingoistic selves (though those are hinted at). The movie wants to put us in touch with our loving generous selves. It often succeeds. There is a reason McLoughlin tells of wife Donna (Maria Bello) and the incomplete task of a kitchen renovation. A tender moral comes embedded in Jimenos recounting of his and wife Allisons gentle tussle about the name of their not-yet-born daughter. Our daily lives prove our foundation even amid ruins. Its a romantic notion one that Stone the director of the great (""Platoon"" ""Born on the Fourth of July"") and the disastrous (""Alexander"") has embraced with old-fashioned grace. Some directors might have wheeled their cameras through production designer Jan Roelfs claustrophobic rubble taking us where no camera has gone before. Stone and cinematographer Seamus McGarvey hew to the spirit of a nonflashy script about two men who began the day as rescuers and ended up survivors two of only 20 saved after the towers collapse. The movie opens with McLoughlin and Jimeno readying for another day in New York City. A police officers or firefighters fresh day may require slightly different rituals. Veteran McLoughlin opens the door to each of his kids rooms in the predawn darkness. Residents of New York have their own a.m. rituals. Stone captures the grime but also the sun and the commuter camaraderie that is part of that great city. Theres a fine parity to the screenplay and to the way Cages and Penas performances submit to a story. Rookie Jimeno is walking his beat making small talk with the usual Times Square characters when the roar of a plane startles and a shadow races across the side of a building. Stone believes in the human face. He trusts close-ups. Cage and Pena their characters pinned beneath concrete slabs work with each grimace each hard-fought word. There are also the varied expressions of loved ones beginning with those of Bellos Donna McLoughlin and Allison Jimeno (Maggie Gyllenhaal). Stone and his editor have created a touching quandary about flashbacks. Are they the memories of the trapped men or those of their wives? Are they an expression of a sort of magical-romanticism? No matter these memories become a ladder reaching from the abyss to the light above. Some ""World Trade Center"" personalities have wrinkles. Ex-Marine Dave Karnes is so driven to get to ground zero from his home in Connecticut one might imagine hes a rhetorical composite. But no. Actor Michael Shannon takes this actual God-driven man at grim-faced value. After Karnes makes a religious-poetic pronouncement about the smoke shrouding ground zero a firefighter calls him a nutjob. He is - and isnt. Faith has that ambiguous quality. He is also a rescuer. Film critic Lisa Kennedy can be reached at 303-820-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com.

World Trade Center Movie Review (2006) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/world-trade-center-2006,200,worldtradecenter13,worldtradecenter,rogerebert
"`World Trade Center is Oliver Stones touching tribute to those who did their duty on 9/11 - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Emotional rescue In `World Trade Center Oliver Stone creates a touching tribute to those who did their duty on 9/11 By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  August 9 2006 People mourn in different ways. Some lock their hearts in a box and nurse their grief in private; others head to the nearest public square to rend their garments. So too with 9/11 movies Some like this springs ``United 93"" distrust the urge to mythify and replay the tragedy with blunt fidelity. Others seek comfort in commemoration looking for stray moments of indomitability and building emotional statuary to the fallen.``World Trade Center"" builds a memorial to the risen actually -- two New York Port Authority cops who survived being buried for nearly 24 hours under the rubble of Tower Two. If that seems unduly rosy in the face of the 2759 people who didnt make it the movie has the grace to suggest we need those few who return carrying the tale. Honoring them only sharpens our grief for the others.Oliver Stone has made an honorable film in other words and almost the best thing I can say about it is that it doesnt feel like an Oliver Stone movie. There are no conspiracies here no pointing of fingers beyond a slow-rising anger at the perpetrators. ``World Trade Center"" is big and its sentimental and it thankfully resists the urge to fetishize the images that have been horribly familiar for nearly five years now. The film rarely goes wide to take in the larger picture; it sees the cataclysm quite literally from ground zero. In so doing it puts human faces on the hundreds of rescue workers who perished paying tribute to both their averageness and their astounding resolve.Well all right one of those faces belongs to Nicolas Cage movie star. As if shying from the spotlight though the actor plays Sergeant John McLoughlin with minimal show. Cage is rail-thin here hiding behind a mustache a uniform and the sort of competence that doesnt have to assert itself. When first word of the disaster comes to the Port Authority midtown command post McLoughlin simply saddles up and asks for volunteers to come with him and his worth can be gauged by the disappointment of those who arent chosen.Four PA cops head downtown with him and the magnitude of whats going on grows with every block. Yet the officers are too busy parsing rumor and responding to immediate problems to step back. ``World Trade Center"" relegates9/11 iconography to the background The ash-covered businessmen and bloodied office workers are glimpsed fleetingly and the film never stops to identify the source of the periodic crashing noises that startle the police and firemen. (After a while we understand theyre the sound made by falling human bodies.) Stone and writer Andrea Berloff turn the movie into a testament to professionalism and only then do they wonder where professionalism ends and panic begins. With the collapse of Tower Two ``World Trade Center"" becomes a survival film the sort of true-life saga that might make a decent TV movie if the surrounding event werent burned into our collective psyche. The men of McLoughlins team are pinned under concrete blocks that shift with dreadful impersonal unpredictability. One of the cops does something that looks like suicide; whether Stone muffs the scene or hes protecting the mans memory isnt clear.Finally it comes down to a handful of officers immobilized in darkness choking out banalities to keep each other alive. McLoughlin and the others are free from the neck up; its as if theyd gone to work and found themselves in a Beckett play. In this hell the audience and the other men come to rely on Officer Will Jimeno (Michael Pena) whose spirit seems uncrushable; Pena one of the faces in the crowd of last years ``Crash"" gives a performance for which year-end awards seem petty.Above ground Stone now switches his focus to the families. Maria Bello as Donna McLoughlin and Maggie Gyllenhaal as Jimenos pregnant wife Allison play their parts with weary grit and distress signals only we and their children can see. What sentimentality the movie doles out is reserved for the flashbacks the men use to keep themselves from faltering. Perhaps two scenes featuring a glowing Jesus is one too many but if thats what helped the real Will Jimeno stay alive then were almost beyond criticism here. (Anyway Stone has always been a director who scoffs at the notion of restraint; thats his strength and his big old Achilles  heel.)The movie also spotlights those who plunged into the wreckage to find the fallen officers Emergency Service Unit officer Scott Strauss (an unrecognizable Stephen Dorff) and paramedic Chuck Sereika (Frank Whaley making his character a touchingly uncertain man who rises to the occasion). The most startling character is Dave Karnes (Michael Shannon) a devout accountant and ex-Marine who the moment he saw the news reports walked out of his office  put on his military uniform and proceeded to ground zero to do what he could. In the scarily intense Karnes we see a righteous thirst for vengeance co exist with a tenderness almost beyond measure; Stone reminds the viewer of how the destruction of the towers fused hot contradictory emotions in us all.``World Trade Center"" proudly samples patriotism among its other core emotions; to do otherwise would be to play the day false. If you want a 9/11 drama that engages the political underpinnings of the event -- what led up to the attacks what ensued -- you should find another movie.Call this playing it safe or focusing on the things that matter the result is that Stone has made a less rigorous more comforting film than Paul Greengrasss monumental ``United 93."" ``World Trade Center"" barely references terrorism and acknowledges the rest of the world only through shots of horror-struck crowds in foreign countries (its as though theyre watching the latest most realistic Hollywood blockbuster). Stone and Berloff stick to the days damage and resilience and their faith in the innate goodness of average Americans is as genuinely touching as it is soothing.And if part of your brain wonders why we cant process a catastrophe like this until it has been turned into a Hollywood movie or why we sift an unimaginably horrific day for the few pinpoints of good news feel free to follow such thoughts wherever they may lead you. One reason ``World Trade Center"" is such a good healing cry is that it absolves us of the discomfort of thinking about everything that has happened since.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

"Oliver Stones World Trade Centerreviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Oliver Stones World Trade Centerreviewed. Oliver Stones World Trade Centerreviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Aug. 8 2006 1017 PM Stone Cold Oliver Stones World Trade Center is brutally effective. But what is he after? By Dana Stevens Listen to Dana Stevens Spoiler Special about  World Trade Center by clicking the arrow on the player below Nicolas Cage in World Trade Center Going in it was the last thing Id have expected that an Oliver Stone-directed movie about 9/11--especially one containing not one but two visions of Jesus--would make me cry four times one of them during a vision of Jesus. After United 93 a far more sober re-creation of the events of that doomed day left me thoroughly unnerved but strangely unmoved I had decided that perhaps as hecklers chided standup comics in the early days after the attacks it was still ""too soon."" And despite the undeniable power of Stones World Trade Center (Paramount) I still think maybe it is. Five years after the day that ripped up our country and our world in ways were still struggling to comprehend any fictional (or even thinly fictionalized) rendering of that days story feels ponderous freighted with the duty to be not a but the 9/11 movie. And that requirement in turn--that a piece of popular entertainment be the vehicle through which we understand and mourn our losses--feels somehow slightly obscene. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. When Stones movie is at its best it simply ignores the temptation to say everything about 9/11 instead keeping its focus tightly trained on the two domestic dramas at its center. In so doing it forfeits all possibility of suspense. We know going in that the two cops at the movies center John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena) will live through their ordeal pinned beneath rubble in the concourse between the two towers; after all McLoughlin Jimeno and their wives served as consultants on the movie and Stone has testified in interviews to his obsessive attention with getting the details right. Like United 93 World Trade Center proceeds with an airless Spam-in-a-can sense of inevitability; as the characters debate about whether the first plane to hit the tower was a light aircraft we wince with dramatic irony. The difference is that this time not everything will turn out as awful as we can possibly imagine at least not for the films two lucky protagonists. Advertisement The film cuts between the men languishing in the dark hole beneath the towers slipping in and out of consciousness and their frantic wives (Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal) waiting for word as cable-news anchors squawk in the background. McLoughlin and Jimeno exchange small talk about their families to keep each other going. Then they scream in terror as chunks of burning rubble rain down at random intervals onto their trapped and partly crushed bodies. These exchanges are surprisingly dynamic given that the protagonists are less than talking heads--theyre mere talking faces immobilized and caked with grime. The above-ground scenes serve as a periodic release from the almost unbearable intensity of the underground ones. But they also capture some of the wired atmosphere of those first days after the attack when whole families--even those who didnt have a relative in the towers--clustered around the TV set like cavemen around a fire. Its when Stone tries to get all world-historical on us that the movie stumbles. An example In one uncharacteristically fancy shot the camera pulls back from Cage and Penas concrete trap sails through the hole in the wreckage above them and continues to rise until it shows us all of Lower Manhattan and finally the whole Earth from space as seen by a satellite. Its an attention-grabbing but ultimately empty special effect and a betrayal of the intimate story weve been pulled into caring about. After all of that quiet painful face time spent with two trapped suffering men being hauled into outer space and reminded that this is an Event that Changed the World feels crass not to mention condescending. McLoughlin and Jimenos descent into hell makes for a hell of a story far truer and more moving than an attempt to represent the whole day on an epic scale like some dreadful remake of The Towering Inferno. In a panel hosted by HBO shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks Stone drew fire for envisioning a ""bullet of a movie"" that would give screen time to both the victims and the terrorists points of view; he compared such a movie to The Battle of Algiers the legendary faux-documentary about the Algerian struggle for independence from France. World Trade Center is assuredly not that movie. Nary a Middle Eastern character appears in the film nor a reference to al-Qaida or Osama; Im not even sure the word ""terrorism"" is ever uttered except perhaps by the TV anchors who natter in the background. Stone has insisted in interviews that his movie is resolutely apolitical. But the very decision to dramatize this subject matter is by definition a political statement however vague; how could there be a purely personal film about one of the most public events in world history? Stone is one of those rare polarizing figures with the ability to piss off both the right and left; the former for obvious reasons the latter because his paranoid bluster gives heft to the conservative caricature of liberals as a pack of crazies. Here he equivocates between the two; whatever the color of your state youre likely to choke up when McLoughlin and Jimeno are reunited with their weeping families. Is Stone pulling punches in the attempt to sell movie tickets after the debacle of Alexander and the general decline of his fortunes in Hollywood? I tend to think not. Nutty as he is Stones always struck me as a true believer even a swooner. You dont go from lionizing Castro (in his 2003 documentary Comandante) to lionizing the U.S. Marines out of a sense of political expediency. For all its crude effectiveness as a true-life melodrama of survival World Trade Center doesnt do much with 9/11 except to sentimentalize it for popular consumption. But sentimentality itself is a wildly useful political tool--one of propagandas ultimate aims has always been to make us cry. What exactly Stone is propagandizing for is another question one that we may have to wait for his next movie to answer. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

And toward the end the camera conveys the awful magnitude of the event when in a blighted blue light it pulls up and up from a smoking pit that could pass for the site of a meteors impact or the entrance to hell. In between the prelude and the coda though the action such as it is consists of a patchwork narrative to which the filmmaker and his colleagues have brought the sensibility of an old-fashioned Hollywood disaster movie and a mediocre one at that. The narrative is illuminated from time to time by flashes of genuine emotion. How could it not be since its basis was the true all but miraculous story of two Port Authority cops who found themselves trapped 20 feet below the rubble field and came out alive? Yet Mr. Stones stolid direction and Andrea Berloffs tone-deaf script manage to give truth the ring of hackneyed fiction. ENLARGE Nicolas Cage plays a Port Authority policeman in World Trade Center. What was meant to be inspirational is conventional at best manipulative at worst and quite incredibly repetitive to the point of tedium in the long passages during which the anguished heroes await rescue or death. Before the movies release concern was voiced in some quarters that Oliver Stone a vehement critic of American policies and in the conspiratorial coils of his ""JFK"" a twister of American history was the wrong choice for directing a film intended to celebrate the nations courage and patriotism in the face of catastrophe. But the problem isnt his politics or his revisionism; its the clumsy dramatics and cliches of the production as a whole. The real-life cops Officer Will Jimeno and Sgt. John McLoughlin are played respectively by Michael Pena whose performance is unremarkable and Nicolas Cage who has done something close to the role before -- as the haunted paramedic in Martin Scorseses ""Bringing Out the Dead."" Thats not a reason he shouldnt have been cast this time -- hes rarely uninteresting on the screen -- but he lays a heavy spirit and a familiar movie-star presence on a character that as written lacks variety and spontaneity. Mr. Cage does get a few lively moments in scenes of his family life. (McLoughlins wife is played by Maria Bello). Still the families of both men seem to be imports from network TV -- in flashbacks during the cops long entombment and in cutaways that depict the anguish of wives children and relatives who dont know if their loved ones are alive or dead. Again veracity is not the issue. The homely suburban details -- domestic quarreling the cancellation of a den mothers meeting -- may well be based on fact but theyre made to feel false. Movie DetailsLearn more about Oliver Stones World Trade Center. The sole survivor of this stultifying style is Maggie Gyllenhaal who plays Jimenos wife Allison. She avoids being actorly by applying brisk intelligence and restless energy. One of the movies few spontaneous moments comes when Allison on the phone with a potential source of information says impatiently ""Brian did he go in the building or did he not go in the building? Its basic."" Many moviegoers who see this film will care little or not at all about matters of craftsmanship. In these uncertain times theres a yearning for authentic heroism a hunger for entertainment that expresses love of country without apology. ""World Trade Center"" speaks to such needs though that doesnt make the drama worthy of the subject. The extended prelude certainly has great power -- a shadow crossing the sky as the first jet hits the shattering sight and especially the sound of towers collapsing on themselves -- yet even these sequences carry hints that the films resources will not be equal to its task. Pandemonium in the streets isnt shown so much as suggested by the expedient of slo-mo photography. Paper snowflakes fill the air but only one body falls through them; would the sight of many doomed jumpers have been too distressing? Then what promised to be an epic spectacle suddenly devolves into the narrowly focused relentlessly claustrophobic story of two men struggling to stay alive in the improbable silence of a steel-and-concrete tomb. That is of course the storys essence; one cant ask it to be something else. But the movie like the men becomes immobilized because the story cant sustain the time it fills notwithstanding those frequent flashbacks and cutaways gobs of sentimental dialogue elegiac music and an appallingly risible vision in which the parched Jimeno sees Jesus holding out a bottle of designer water. ENLARGE Maggie Gyllenhaal applies intelligence and energy to her role as Allison. A minor but significant character is also fairly appalling as the film portrays him -- Dave Karnes an accountant and ex-Marine from Connecticut. The real-life Karnes is the one who found the two Port Authority cops leading rescuers to where they were buried -- a hero of sorts in his own right. But the Karnes on screen played by Michael Shannon is unaccountably full of himself and given to such windy declarations as ""Im not coming in today. Were going to need some good men out there to avenge this"" or ""Looks like God made a curtain with the smoke shielding us from what were not yet ready to see."" A conspiracy theorist might wonder if Oliver Stone used this weird creation to subvert the patriotism and religiosity of his own film. In the wake of Paul Greengrasss ""United 93"" the first big-screen feature to dramatize the events of 9/11 ""World Trade Center"" is being marketed as an upbeat optimistic alternative with a happy ending in which the heroes emerge more or less intact rather than a tragic ending in which the heroes sacrifice their lives to save many others. But the differences go deeper. The hourlong preface of the Greengrass film used deft and agile techniques to tell us specific things we didnt know about the nations lack of preparedness; then ""United 93"" took to the air for a taut horrific drama based convincingly on very few facts. ""World Trade Center"" shows us many things we already know though with impressive flair then plunges underground for an unconvincing drama based on a multitude of facts. Its upbeat all right but badly off kilter. Mr. Morgenstern is the Journals film critic. Read his reviews this Friday and every Friday in Weekend Journal.

It also is a powerful film told without any discernible political agenda. There can be no more gripping subject to mine for cinematic potency and drama than what has come to be called in cliched shorthand ""the terrible events of Sept. 11."" And this film tells the devastating story in a more intimate manner than one might expect from the title. Because the focus is the true story of a pair of police officers trapped for more than a day in the towers debris we absorb the magnitude in a personal fashion. Director Oliver Stone deftly handles sights that are almost too much to bear (bodies hurtling from the top floors bloodied survivors staggering from buildings) in an almost matter-of-fact style never detracting from their haunting quality. When disoriented veteran Sgt. John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) trapped under 20 feet of concrete and metal asks fellow officer Will Jimeno (Michael Pena) where they are Jimeno sums it up in a way that in any other situation would be melodramatic ""In hell."" But those words emerge as an understatement. Pena last seen as the locksmith in Crash is pitch-perfect. He outshines Cage whose New York accent sometimes distracts from what he has to say. One particularly powerful scene The camera takes in the wreckage underground then pans upward as McLoughlin asks whether Jimeno can see any light. The camera continues to pan up until we are outside in a nightmarish mess of bent steel girders. The camera continues to zoom skyward to the unseen satellites beaming reports of the catastrophe around the world. It is an inspired way to encapsulate a global sense of shock and outrage. Stone does take some missteps The score has some overbearing moments and there is a fair amount of cliched dialogue. Also scenes featuring the officers families waiting for news are often wooden and can feel like a TV movie. But this is a tricky story to tell given the barrage of news coverage. Stones use of visual and sound effects are excellent and avoid sensationalism. Where United 93 was a superb example of masterful storytelling World Trade Center is a more conventional rendering. Some might have expected a more controversial angle from the director of films such as JFK and Natural Born Killers. Still in its celebration of the human spirit it is undeniably uplifting. Stone takes one of the most tragic events of this century and focuses on the hope humanity and determination that also held sway amid the darkness. (Rated PG-13 for intense emotional content disturbing images and language. Running time 2 hours and 2 minutes. Opens Wednesday nationwide.)

"World Trade Center | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; world-trade-center ) World Trade Center (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Turning back the calendar to the morning of September 11 2001 is a risky proposition for any director and not to be undertaken lightly. Paul Greengrass succeeded brilliantly with his United 93 and now Oliver Stone never one to back away from a challenge has decided to tell another story under the 9/11 umbrella. His film World Trade Center comes unencumbered by the directors baggage. There is no political message. There are no conspiracy theories. And the camerawork is straightforward lacking the over-the-top flourishes that have hampered some of the directors recent efforts. World Trade Center is Stones most potent motion picture since Platoon and may be the most accessible across-the-board since Wall Street. There are thousands of stories that could be told about the events that occurred in Lower Manhattan on that fateful day. Stone concentrates on two of them. In total 20 survivors were pulled from the wreckage of the Twin Towers. Two of the last were Port Authority policemen John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael PeA+-a). After entering the concourse between the North and South Towers shortly before 1030 am they became trapped in the wreckage after the collapse of buildings. While their respective wives Donna (Maria Bello) and Allison (Maggie Gyllenhaal) balanced on the razors edge of uncertainty John and Will struggled to remain conscious long enough for rescuers to find and free them. The movie details their experience from when they awoke in the wee hours of September 11 until they lay in adjacent hospital beds 24 hours later. Stone opens the film with a number of shots of ""old Manhattan"" - New York City as it was while the Twin Towers stood proud and defiant one of the defining landmarks of a world-famous skyline. Its an effective way to take us back five years to another lifetime. We relive the horror of the buildings destruction through a combination of news reports and the eyes of the first responders. The latter is a perspective that has not yet been explored in detail. Stone shows restraint in depicting the carnage. All of his shots of the burning towers are archived images of the crippled North Tower. When the World Trade Center falls our perspective is not that of an outside observer but of the men on the inside who dont realize the full extent of what is happening. Theres a lot of noise and dust and debris but John and Will surmise incorrectly that the concourse has collapsed and nothing else. During the second half of the movie with John and Will trapped and unable to move the drama forward by themselves Stone weaves in other plotlines. Theres the story of ex-Marine Dave Karnes (Michael Shannon) who drives from Connecticut to join the search for survivors. Then most affectingly there are the tales of Donna who tries to reassure her children while inwardly succumbing to uncertainty and Allison who wonders how to tell her four-year old daughter and the her unborn child that their father is dead. Oddly during World Trade Centers second half the portions of the narrative focusing on the families are more compelling that the claustrophobic scenes of John and Will struggling to remain awake and alive. The movie reinforces a theme highlighted by United 93- that heroism often rises from the ashes of tragedy. Many men risked their lives to free John and Will and millions of others prayed for them. September 11 was a day that rocked a nation to its core but it also brought the people of a city a region and a country together in a way that nothing else in the past half-century has done. It would be too facile to describe World Trade Centers message as being that every cloud has a sliver lining but the movie stresses not the evils of 9/11 that live after it but the good that is more easily interred and forgotten. (With apologies to W.S.) For the actors appearing in the film is a daunting task in large part because of their responsibility to the men and women they are playing. The four principals were involved in the production process although dissent was voiced by the widow of Dominick Pezzulo (Jay Hernandez) whose husband is shown shooting himself after being mortally wounded. The participation of the McLoughlins and the Jimenos put pressure on Nicolas Cage Maria Bello Michael PeA+-a and Maggie Gyllenhaal to be both accurate and sympathetic. They succeed. Their characters are shown to be decent human beings. They have flaws but those flaws are de-emphasized to place the focus on their strength and heroism. In its own way this movie is as wrenching and powerful as United 93. It deals in an uncompromising way with subject material that some viewers are not yet ready to confront in a movie theater. World Trade Center provokes a range of emotional responses resurrecting the horror of the moment but infusing it not only with a new perspective but with an element of hope thats as undeniable as the beam of light streaming through the wreckage. If theres a weakness - and its minor quibble - its that the hallucinations and flashbacks of the trapped men dont add as much to the narrative fabric as the filmmakers intend for them to do. World Trade Center makes an excellent companion piece to United 93. The films have different styles and they present diverse perspectives of a day that has limitless faces. Both are thoughtful intelligent and emotionally potent. They provoke and challenge asking us not only to face our memories but to question our future. By being less political than he has ever been Stone offers a movie that can be embraced by movie-goers who sit on the left side of the theater in the center or on the right. Its an achievement and it makes one hope that future feature films about 9/11 (and there will surely be more) will exhibit the same mix of dramatic force and tasteful restraint.

The camera pans not up at the sky but down the street to reveal the shadow of a low-flying plane climbing the face of a building. Stone never shows the planes crashing into the Twin Towers. Hes letting us know right from the start that we will see history unfold as it happened on the ground from the perspectives of ordinary men and women.The policemen portrayed in ""World Trade Center"" are real guys and Stone is telling a true story. His heroes are not prepared for the disaster that looms. Most of the cops in the little squad headed by Sgt. John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) decline to volunteer to go into the buildings but a few including Jimeno (Michael Pena) step forward. The men are obviously frightened especially when they hear the sickening thump of bodies falling around them. They dont rush boldly into the buildings like action heroes in a disaster movie but rather move slowly hesitantly. Still they do their duty in the face of terrible danger. Their bravery as well as the courage of their families and their rescuers helps to redeem the darkest of days.This is not the 9/11 story most people would expect from Oliver Stone. There are no conspiracies lurking in the background. No axes to grind. Five years ago in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 Stone was asked what kind of movie hed make in response to the attack. He invoked the classic French thriller about terrorism ""The Battle of Algiers."" He described a movie structured like a hunt which would show how terrorism worked from both the Arab and the American sides. ""And if it were done realistically without the search for a hero which is often required it would be a fascinating procedural"" he said. A ragged Stone who looked as if hed been up half the night was onstage at the New York Film Festival on a panel called ""Making Movies That Matter"" which this writer moderated. It was less than a month after 9/11 and passions ran high. Christopher Hitchens the acid-tongued English journalist jumped on Stone when he too-casually referred to the attack as ""the revolt."" Stone went on a tear about how capitalism had run amok and was destroying the movie business. He got pilloried in the press. Stone who never forgets a fight or a bad word written about him is still angry about the way the media twisted his words making them sound as if he said the attack was a specific response to the corporate New World Order. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week These days if Stone has a theory about September 11 hes keeping it to himself. Capitalism marches on. ""World Trade Center"" --made with the full cooperation of McLoughlin and Jimeno--is a far cry from ""The Battle of Algiers."" It has no interest in the terrorism. Its explicitly about heroism. It may strike some at first glance as a surprisingly conventional film from this controversial filmmaker. And its the rare Stone film he didnt write himself. But he knew when he first read Andrea Berloffs powerful screenplay that he wanted to make it and he petitioned for the job. ""The beauty of the script was that it had hope"" Stone says. He knew that after ""Alexander"" and other commercial failures Hollywood regarded him as tainted goods never mind his two Oscars. ""I guess I couldnt get arrested is one way of saying it."" But ""World Trade Center"" is anything but an impersonal job-for-hire. The passion that went into its making is pure Stone and many of its concerns--his fascination with men in groups with working-class camaraderie with the nature of courage--can be traced back 20 years to ""Platoon.""Piercingly moving and utterly unpolitical ""World Trade Center"" holds us in a fierce grip. At the simplest level its a rescue movie. McLoughlin 53 and Jimeno 38 were on a rescue mission themselves when the building collapsed around them. Stones terrifying re-creation of the towers imploding--the sound of it--is the first time a filmmaker has shown us what it must have felt like from the inside and the scenes impact is indelible. But its that deathly quiet moment after the screen goes black when we first see in the darkness the pinned immobile body of McLoughlin buried in the rubble of the tower that the viewer feels a stab of claustrophobic panic. We ask ourselves not just ""Will John and Will ever get out?"" but more selfishly will we?It was a question Stone anticipated as he plunged into the project. How much would an audience endure? The director had to figure out when and how often his narrative needed to return aboveground where we meet Wills and Johns families desperate for news of the missing men and follow the rescue workers searching the rubble for survivors. At what point would the viewer shut down? Stones calibrations reveal his superb storytelling instincts. Hes not interested in punishing us. But his worry could stand as a metaphor for the questions that surround the representation of 9/11 in the arts. How much can we bear? What can art illuminate about that day? Should an artist be constrained by the sensitivities of the survivors? Who is to judge what can and cant be said about that watershed event?The release of ""World Trade Center"" only a few months after Paul Greengrasss shattering ""United 93"" indicates a 180-degree turn in the five years since the attack--at least in Hollywoods response. Immediately after 9/11 all images of the towers were digitally erased from movies. Filmmakers rewrote the horizon line of New York for fear that a glimpse of those buildings in an innocuous romantic comedy like ""Serendipity"" would jar an audience out of the fantasy. A moment in ""Spider-Man"" that had featured the superhero spinning a web between the towers was cut. But by 2005 Steven Spielberg in ""Munich"" was digitally inserting the Twin Towers into the skyline at the end of the film linking the terrorism in his tale to the terrorist attack that was to come. Now Stone takes us deep into the charred heart of Ground Zero. A cultural psychoanalyst citing Kubler-Rosss five stages of grief might argue that this portends that we have moved from denial to acceptance. Perhaps. But nothing about our collective response to that day has been simple or neat.Forging art out of tragedy is a primal human response. In New York it began on Sept. 12. ""I was gripped by all the little shrines that had sprung up all over the city of New York"" recalls art critic Arthur Danto who curated a show called ""The Art of 9/11"" last September. ""The spontaneity the way in which everybody seemed to do it to express their feelings--right away right away--through these little shrines. It taught me something about how people respond to devastation through beauty."" Photographers were the natural first responders to document the searing images of a city turned upside down seemed the most direct urgent response. Songwriters of every stripe searched for musical balm. Later playwrights choreographers painters composers and novelists would weigh in trying to take the measure of a day that had changed the future. As Greengrass puts it ""Suddenly the world was never going to be free of fear for any of us."" The short-story writer Deborah Eisenberg would transmute that feeling memorably in her short story ""Twilight of the Superheroes"" ""O that day One kept waiting for that shattering day to unhappen so that the real--the intended--future the one that had been implied by the past could unfold. Hour after hour month after month waiting for that day to not have happened. But it had happened. And now it was always going to have happened.""From the first there was an acute self-consciousness about what was culturally appropriate. Some of the self-imposed restrictions were a matter of tact a response to the rawness of our feelings. Disaster movies were pulled from the TV schedule. Ultraviolent films in the works were canceled (temporarily). Clear Channel issued a long peculiar list of songs deemed unseemly for airplay on its radio stations. (""Imagine""? Really?) The Death of Irony was prematurely declared. Now finally it was predicted wed turn away from our frivolous preoccupation with celebrity. And people were told to watch what they said.As Stones movie reminds us in news clips of people around the globe watching in shock the sympathies of the world were with us. It was not to last. The politicization of 9/11 could not wait. In a climate of fear and flag-waving with a pre-emptive war soon to come the artist became suspect. The right-wing press accused Steve Earle of treason for writing ""John Walkers Blues"" a song that tried to get inside the mind of the young American Taliban fighter captured in Afghanistan. The left cringed at Toby Keiths bombs-away musical response to 9/11 ""Courtesy of the Red White and Blue"" (""Soon as we could see clearly/Through our big black eye/Man we lit up your world/Like the Fourth of July""). ""The fact that everybody felt they had to line up and march to the same drummer after 9/11 was a really sad moment in the history of art"" says Michael Moore. Cartoonist Art Spiegelman remembers the pressures that artists felt. ""At the end of 2002 there was a kind of fearfulness that went well beyond yellow or orange alerts"" says the author of ""In the Shadow of No Towers"" a book that records his personal response to the terrorist attack. ""There was a shutdown not just of irony but of comedy and political conversations that could be seen in some ways as disloyal."" By the time his 2004 book came out Spiegelman found there had been a thaw ""It was the beginning of a sea change.""Almost by definition artists make their own rules and are hostile to restraints. Whatever works. ""In art anything goes and if it goes it goes"" says John Updike whose new best-selling novel ""Terrorist"" concerns an 18-year-old Muslim suicide bomber raised in New Jersey. ""There should be no off-limits signs to the writers imagination. Kurt Vonnegut once said about the Holocaust that he thought only the people who were there are entitled to write about it. I dont feel thats the case with 9/11. I think most of the people who were really there cant speak now. We should not be afraid of trying to grasp it.""When previews of Greengrasss ""United 93"" appeared in theaters some shouted that it was ""too soon"" to relive this experience. But no one had asked if it was too soon for Ian McEwan to publish his novel ""Saturday"" for Jonathan Safran Foer to write ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close""--or even if it was too soon for the earlier widely viewed TV movie on Aamp;E ""Flight 93."" The question arose when Hollywood got into the act a testament both to the overwhelming visceral power of movies (lets not forget how often that day everyone kept repeating how much like a disaster movie the destruction of the towers felt) and to the publics perennial suspicions of Hollywoods motives.The outpouring of art about 9/11 underscores the centrality of that day in our national identity. How could an artist avoid it? What is less clear and more fraught with ambivalence is whether the publics appetite for 9/11 art matches the artists need to produce it. ""United 93"" was a brilliant piece of cinema verite-style filmmaking but many people knowing how the story ended understandably refused to submit themselves to the experience. It left the taste of ashes in your mouth.Stones ""World Trade Center"" is a very different kind of movie. For one thing its a story few of us have heard. More crucially it holds out hope its a story of survival and selflessness. What it does share with ""United 93"" is the desire to look at the event with eyes uncontaminated by politics. ""WTC"" should be embraced as readily by conservatives (whom Paramount is actively courting with advance screenings in Washington) as by liberals. For two hours and nine minutes at least it makes the distinction irrelevant.This will come as a surprise to those who think of Stone as the polemical director of ""JFK"" and ""Nixon"" and ""Salvador."" Straightforward classically paced this Stone movie has neither the feverish stylistic hysteria of ""Natural Born Killers"" nor the emotional overkill that sometimes marred ""Born on the Fourth of July."" ""The style of this movie"" says Stone ""is dictated by its subject--its simplicity its modesty its working-class origins."" One of his models was the austere French director Robert Bressons ""Diary of a Country Priest"" a story of a spiritual journey played out largely on the face of its protagonist.""World Trade Center"" is several things an act of commemoration an edge-of-your-seat rescue movie a moving tribute to all who risked and gave their lives at Ground Zero and a family drama that examines the marriages that in Stones view gave John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno reasons to live. (A blue-eyed Maria Bello all coiled tension plays Donna McLoughlin and Maggie Gyllenhaal pitched a hairbreadth short of hysteria plays Allison Jimeno. Both are superb.) For Stone the movie ponders one question ""What keeps people alive?"" As the reticent leader racked with guilt about the men hes lost and as the younger man who had grown up dreaming of becoming a cop Cage and Pena acting for much of the movie under the constraint of stillness do an extraordinary job of illuminating the inner turmoil of these plain-spoken men.""The consequences of 9/11 are enormous to this world not just to America"" says Stone. ""This movie is made for the world and if its what I hope it to be it transcends 9/11. Its about anybody anywhere who feels the taste of death whether it was a bombing in Madrid or an earthquake or a tsunami. Its the same theme of being trapped. And you are dependent on others for rescue. I was rescued one time by someone who saved me and my son from drowning in Bali. And there were a few close calls in Vietnam. It is all these things youre aware of at the last moment. I appreciated the chance to illustrate it.""As a Vietnam vet Stone is the rare Hollywood director of his generation whose knowledge of life doesnt come just from old movies. In that hes a throwback to the old-time moviemakers he reveres like Frank Capra. And like Capra he isnt afraid of heading into territory some might label sentimental. Stone was determined to be faithful to the factual details of John and Wills experience and that takes him places you may not expect an Oliver Stone movie to go. Jimeno was sustained in this long ordeal by an actual vision of Jesus and Stone shows us that vision as Will might have seen it. Pena puts a marvelous spin on the moment playing it not with pious awe but with an almost childlike delight.One of the two men who first found McLoughlin and Jimeno was Sgt. David Karnes (Michael Shannon) a character many preview viewers wrongly assumed was a pure Hollywood contrivance. Karnes an ex-Marine and devout Christian who was working as an accountant in Connecticut on 9/11 felt called to Ground Zero by God. He shaved his head donned his old uniform and drove to New York (in a Porsche 911--a portentous omen the movie omits for fear of stretching our credulity too far). Karnes then talked his way through the security lines and miraculously located the men buried in the wreckage. His eyes blazing with zealous righteousness Karnes will be seen by some as a moral paragon by others as a ""nut job"" as one of the rescue workers refers to him. What no one can deny is that his heroism helped save these mens lives. Stone makes no judgment.Stone himself was in need of a redemption when he discovered Berloffs script for ""WTC."" He had devoted years of his life to making his historical epic ""Alexander."" ""God what an experience"" he says. ""It was a highlight of my cinematic life and that includes a lot of highlights."" So he was ""triply crushed"" when the film was battered by the critics and crashed and burned in the United States. ""This town is ruthless unforgiving.""Producers Michael Shamberg and Stacy Sher were thrilled that Stone saw exactly the same movie they envisioned. (""WTC"" was originally launched by producer Debra Hill who died of cancer last year.) Within 20 minutes of their first meeting Stone and Berloff had a blueprint of the Trade Center on the floor and were tracing the path that their heroes had taken as they walked through the mall. The directors trademark intensity never let up. ""I remember the first time we took him to meet the McLoughlins and the Jimenos"" recalls Sher. ""It was like hours of cross-examination. He carries these legal pads. When you work with Oliver its like having the D.A. or the top prosecutor working for you."" Filming the rescue on an elaborate set that production designer Jan Roelfs constructed on an acre of land in Playa Vista Calif. Stone surrounded himself with the real firefighters medics and rescue workers who had been involved altering the dialogue if it wasnt accurate (Karnes wouldnt have said that he was at ""Ground Zero""--that term came later--hed say ""Trade Center""). He often replaced actors and stuntmen with the real rescuers who knew exactly how tight the crawl space was and how to maneuver through it.When test-screening the movie Paramount was struck by the enthusiastic response it elicited from teenagers. For some it seemed to bring into focus an event that had been a disturbing blur. Stone says the film has tested better with all ages than any movie hes made. The studio of course is fervently hoping that all those viewers who were afraid to see ""United 93""--which still made a very respectable 32 million--will flock to the 63 million ""World Trade Center.""Paramount is quite properly emphasizing the movies uplifting qualities. ""A lot of the conversation about 9/11 in the five years since its happened has been motivated by a political agenda. From all sides"" says Maggie Gyllenhaal. ""What thats done is make everyone really wary of talking about it and thinking about it. Which is why I think World Trade Center is so special. Somehow in the midst of all this Oliver has made a movie that doesnt seem to have an agenda either political or personal. It really is about honoring people.""""World Trade Center"" celebrates the ties that bind us the bonds that keep us going the goodness that stands as a rebuke to the horror of that day. Perhaps in the future the times will call for more challenging or polemical or subversive visions. Right now it feels like the 9/11 movie we need.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Then two Port Authority policemen John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena) wake up in darkness their bodies pinned by concrete and twisted metal. As their heads fill the frame the actors find a quiet touching connection. Stone has made a scrupulous and honorable film yet it lacks dramatic urgency. He earns his penance but at the expense of his art. Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

Attempting to convey a macro vision of Sept. 11 through a micro lens Oliver Stone is to be credited for presenting this challenging fact-based story with admirable restraint a quality that has not always characterized his past directorial efforts. Yet these events -- which require no dramatic embellishment -- by their nature result in a claustrophobic film as two port authority cops lie buried in rubble struggling to survive. As such ""World Trade Center"" yields lovely and touching moments but proves a slow-going arduous movie experience if more uplifting than Universals earlier test of that historic days box office potential ""United 93."" With the upcoming five-year anniversary of the towers fall as a somewhat arbitrary milestone Paramounts task to sell another movie steeped in 9/11 lore remains a formidable one. Thats largely because those harrowing images were shared initially through the prism of television and have been explored effectively and extensively within that medium from Jules and Gedeon Naudets CBS documentary ""9/11"" -- which most closely mirrors elements here -- to the various dramatizations related to United 93 and other aspects of the story. Stones film bears some thematic resemblance to ""Alive"" Frank Marshalls 1993 chronicle of a plane crash in the Andes. Both offer a tribute to human endurance under unimaginable conditions but watching young guys huddle together trying not to freeze to death or two cops pinned under tons of debris isnt exactly a cinematic thrill ride. The first produced screenplay from Andrea Berloff ""World Trade Center"" begins with a quiet powerful sense of foreboding as the characters go about what will be anything but another mundane Tuesday. Sergeant John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) drives through the early morning twilight to his job at the New York Port Authority where theres a ""Hill Street Blues""-type briefing before chaos erupts over news that a plane has struck the World Trade Center. McLoughlin and a busload of officers including Will Jimeno (Michael Pena) rush to the scene with scant sense of whats happening. ""Theres no plan"" for an evacuation of this magnitude the taciturn McLoughlin says in his rough accent as he prepares his team to ascend into the building which creaks ominously. Then suddenly the world comes crashing down around them belching out a huge cloud of dust that leaves McLoughlin and Jimeno trapped dozens of feet below ground desperately trying to maintain consciousness -- convinced somehow that succumbing to pain and exhaustion by falling sleep will mean certain death. So far so good but its at this point that the movie perhaps inevitably bogs down. Largely eschewing flashbacks (some are used sparingly) Stone alternates between the imperiled cops McLoughlins wife Donna (Maria Bello) and Jimenos very pregnant spouse Allison (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who waits nervously with her extended family for word regarding her husband. A fourth thread -- and surely the most interesting -- centers on Dave Karnes (Michael Shannon) a spit-and-polish former Marine who improbably dons his dress uniform and drives from Connecticut directly to Ground Zero where he wades through desolation that resembles the nightmare vision of ""The Terminator"" searching for survivors. Beyond this core Stone has populated his film with terrific actors in even minor parts from the various cops to Viola Davis as a worried mother with a missing son to Donna Murphy as one of Donnas friends. The fact remains though that long stretches are shot in tight close-up on John and more personable Will lying immersed in gray muck seeking to stay alive. While both actors deliver strong performances they are confined by the narrative figuratively as well as literally spurring a degree of impatience for the climax. For Paramount the saving grace could be that many who venture into the theater will do so with at best cursory knowledge of the storys resolution unlike the grim certainty of ""United 93"" which yielded modest returns despite considerable advance coverage and praise. Yet both this and the Universal film ultimately present an inspiring vision of can-do American spirit amid adversity exemplified by Karnes and the rescue workers (played by among others Stephen Dorff and Frank Whaley) risking life and limb to assist complete strangers. Technically Stones production is a work of superior craftsmanship highlighted by astonishing sound quality which captures the towers destruction with a staggering din as the buildings give way. Craig Armstrong also delivers an appropriately sensitive score. Among the pics credited producers is Debra Hill who developed the material before dying of cancer last year.
