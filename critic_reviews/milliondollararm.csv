Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; million-dollar-arm ) Million Dollar Arm (United States 2014) May 16 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Movies that arrive in theaters with the tagline ""based on a true story"" often stray far from the historical basis underlying the narrative. As its said ""Never let the facts get in the way of a good story."" Unfortunately in presenting the tale of sports agent J.B. Bernstein (Jon Hamm) and his quest to transform cricket-playing Indians into baseball prospects Disney has taken the skeleton of a potentially worthy motion picture and fleshed it out with an overabundance of feel-good clichA(c)s. The result is sappy saccharine and predictable to the point where its almost painful. Thomas McCarthys screenplay is an example of paint-by-numbers storytelling. When we first meet Bernstein hes down to his last few dollars. The sports agency he started with his partner Ash (Aasif Mandvi) is on its last legs. Their big name clients have all retired and their best chance for a new payday has signed with another agency. Thats when J.B. gets a brainstorm go to India and using a reality show called ""Million Dollar Arm"" to attract contestants find a few good men to bring back to the U.S. and whip into shape for Major League Baseball tryouts. In India with the help of a grumpy old scout (Alan Arkin) J.B. unearths his prospects in Dinesh Patel (Madhur Mittal) and Rinku Singh (Suraj Sharma) but harnessing their talent proves to be a difficult process even for coaching guru Tom House (Bill Paxton). In the end however because this is a Disney sports moviea| well you can guess what happens. Million Dollar Arm isnt completely devoid of value. Even though the overall story and various character arcs are soft-peddled the movie provides some interesting cultural contrasts in a way that evokes the 1986 film Crocodile Dundee. Its a reciprocal situation affecting J.B. in India during the movies first half and Dinesh and Rinku later in Los Angeles. Crocodile Dundee was smarter and funnier but at least give Million Dollar Arm credit for addressing the ""fish out of water"" aspect. That element works better than the awkward romance between J.B. and a female tenant on his property Brenda Fenwick (Lake Bell). I found it odd how little character the country of India displayed even though about 1/3 of the movies scenes transpire there. With the exception of a distant shot of the Taj Mahal the action might as well have transpired in Generic Foreign Country 1. Director Craig Gillespie does little to make India come alive. The film Outsourced about another American coming to India succeeded in part because of an immersive sense of place and culture - qualities mostly absent in Million Dollar Arm. For Jon Hamm this is an opportunity to step away from the character and TV show (Don Draper Mad Men) that have defined him as an actor over the last seven years. Hamm with his leading man looks has little trouble navigating the waters of J.B.s transition from self-absorption to all-around good guy. Disney is selling the movie as the true story of the first two Indians to sign American sports contracts but Million Dollar Arm is more about J.B.s redemption. The two young Indian actors Suraj Sharma (who was the title character in Life of Pi) and Madhur Mittal (who appeared in Slumdog Millionaire) do credible jobs. Alan Arkin and Bill Paxton steal scenes in supporting roles. At two hours in length Million Dollar Arm overstays its welcome. The story as related in this screenplay might have sustained a shorter feature but the one that reaches the screen is bloated and obvious. The movie is typical live action Disney family-friendly and simplistic with nothing controversial and an upbeat ending. Its a little old-fashioned. Unfortunately its also a little boring.

Comments (1) click to enlarge Million Dollar Arm Video Rated PG  124 minutes  2014 Youd never guess this Disney sports drama was scripted by Thomas McCarthy writer-director of such meaty independent releases as The Visitor (2007) and Win Win (2011); its a completely by-the-numbers affair about a sports-marketing agent (Jon Hamm) who sets out to recruit major-league baseball players from India but learns the sturdy lesson that sports should be fun instead of an exercise in moneygrubbing. The story is encrusted with formula the cute young doctor (Lake Bell) who rents the heros backyard apartment and appears on cue to offer one-liners and life advice the cranky old baseball scout (Alan Arkin) who comes along to India and rips on everyone in sight the wide-eyed teenagers with good arms (Suraj Sharma Madhur Mittal) who journey to America and get into trouble like naughty children. The movie was inspired by the real-life experiences of agent J.B. Bernstein but the story stretches all the way back to Disneys Jan-Michael Vincent comedy The Worlds Greatest Athlete (1973).

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post This months Vanity Fair cover guy Jon Hamm is busy. The seventh season of ""Mad Men"" is underway and he can also be found in the family-inviting ""Million Dollar Arm."" While Don Drapers portrayer is the star here hes hardly the sole reason the winning baseball flick connects. And so a quick backstory. It was a few years back but memorable just the same. Writer-director Tom McCarthy was in Denver doing publicity for ""The Visitor."" Accompanying him was the incomparable Richard Jenkins who would later be nominated for a best-actor Oscar for his performance as a widower whose New York apartment is inhabited by a couple of undocumented immigrants. McCarthy and Jenkins sat at Dixons restaurant on 16th -- since shuttered. Their heads were tilted at the same slight angle; their eyes riveted to the TV screen. They were watching SportsCenters countdown of the week. Ah the love of the game. Any game it seemed. A few years later McCarthy came to town again for the touchingly funny high-school wrestling movie ""Win Win."" Now hes written the sports-savvy ""Million Dollar Arm"" based on actual events with broad even global appeal not least because it concerns two guys hoping to become major league pitchers who hail from a vast population of movie-lovers India. Hamm plays JB Bernstein a sports agent who in a dire moment in his companys biz cooks up a pitching challenge to take to one of the last untapped markets for baseball. Tzi Ma plays Chang JBs savvy and terse backer. Dinesh Patel (Madhur Mittal) and Rinku Singh (Suraj Sharma) are the two young men who compete in the televised event then travel from India to Los Angeles in hopes of landing a major league contract though neithers ever played baseball. An eager to-please-imp named Amit (Pitobash Tripathy) comes along as interpreter chaperone and hungry baseball acolyte. Aasif Mandvi plays Aash JBs business partner. Their companys woes began in earnest when JB wasnt able to reel in a big-money client footballer Popo (Cincinnati Bengal linebacker Rey Maualuga). Aash is smart loyal a parent. That last fact may be why even more than his Indian heritage that he takes JB to task when he plays a little fast and lose with his trio of strangers in LaLaLand. Lake Bell portrays Brenda a medical resident and JBs tenant. Shes bright relaxed an authentic beauty though not in some flashy way. In other words shes not like the models JBs known to hook up with. A good listener she knows the yearnings and burdens of JBs wards long before he does. Actually a number of characters step up to the plate as the conscience of baseball the caretakers of the boys or both. Alan Arkin brings his pleasing cant-be-bothered crankiness to his role as the baseball scout who accompanies JB in India. Bill Paxton portrays the pitching guru whose wisdom is as celebrated as it is contested. JB is not the wisest of men and ""Million Dollar Arm"" makes no bones about him being a character in need of an upward arc. Even so the movie never sacrifices the other characters as mere handmaidens to his growth. Did we mention the screenwriter? McCarthy didnt direct ""Million Dollar Arm"" (Craig Gillispie did the honors) but his grip on the emotion and humor in this saga is unmistakable. Feel-good drama? Absolutely. But an ace skillset helped Hamm and a deep bench ensemble send this one soaring.

""Million Dollar Arm"" based on true events did a fairly good job of keeping me engaged even though I knew exactly where it was going every step of the way.Its about J.B. Bernstein (Jon Hamm) an L.A. sports agent who after making a fortune with a high-powered agency is struggling on his own. Then he has a brainstorm Recruit the best cricket bowlers (i.e. pitchers) from India and bring them into Major League baseball. He organizes the ""Million Dollar Arm"" competition and travels the continent from Bangalore to Mumbai looking for talent. Accompanying him is a retired baseball scout played by Alan Arkin who can make even narcolepsy seem funny.J.B. comes up with two candidates Rinku (Suraj Sharma from ""Life of Pi"") and Dinesh (Madhur Mittal from ""Slumdog Millionaire"" a movie this one often implicitly references). He flies them back to Los Angeles where they end up camping out in his fancy house and puts them together with a USC baseball coach (played by the great Bill Paxton). Can they quickly develop into big-league material? Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Even without resorting to Google you will have no trouble figuring out the answer to that one. Director Craig Gillespie and screenwriter Tom McCarthy crowd the India scenes with exotic bustle but its all good-natured; I never felt as if the filmmakers were being Hollywood colonialists. In the L.A. scenes they mostly dispense with the usual starry-eyed stranger-in-a-strange-land stuff in favor of a more melancholic tone. These guys are just kids and far from home. The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide Hamm gives an adept performance. (As J.B.s wisecracking tenant Lake Bell matches him.) It might have been better though if Hamm had brought out a bit more of J.B.s self-serving sharkiness. This movie is altogether too nice. I prefer sports movies with more sass and snap like the films Ron Shelton (""Bull Durham"") used to make or even parts of ""Moneyball."" ""Million Dollar Arm"" is enjoyable enough but its onto a bigger subject than it knows what to do with the money-grubbing globalization of American sports.

The fact-based story of a desperate sports agent who recruits two cricket-playing kids from India and tries to mold them into Major League Baseball prospects it has all the subtlety and grace of a Norman Rockwell finger painting. But it may still have you dabbing tears by the end. Youll probably hate yourself for liking it. I know I did. As J.B. Bernstein a former hotshot athlete manager now struggling to make ends meet Jon Hamm doesnt veer far from his comfort zone. J.B. may not have the character shading or style of Mad Mens Don Draper but he does have a facility with the dark art of the sell. In the films opening scene we see him practicing his pitch to a prospective client a football star named Popo. ""It is a simple fact that not everyone is destined to claim their page in the history books"" J.B. says brandishing a bobblehead doll. ""But a lot of people are willing to pay for a piece of it."" Under his confident veneer though J.B. has hit rough times; His small management company which he founded several years ago after a successful career with a big firm is on the rocks and he cant pay his bills. Desperate for a miracle J.B. has a revelation late one night as he switches back and forth between a cricket game on TV and Susan Boyle singing ""I Dreamed a Dream"" on Britains Got Talent. J.B. hates cricket (""It looks like an insane asylum just opened up and the inmates were allowed to create their own game"" he complains) but he sees the potential Bring an Indian cricketer to America groom him to be a baseball pitcher and youve just opened up Americas favorite pastime to a new market of 1 billion people. ""Thats a billion new fans. What do a billion new fans need? A billion hats. A billion T-shirts."" Okay it aint exactly Matthew Weiner but itll do. Several A.R. Rahman-scored montages later J.B. returns from India with two wide-eyed prospects Dinesh (Madhur Mittal) and Rinku (Life of Pis Suraj Sharma) along with goofball translator/videographer Amit (Pitobash). While the film hasnt exactly wowed us with originality up until this point the obligatory fish-out-of-water stuff is a low point as the Indians gawk at elevators (really?) women and just about anything else around them; that the film does little to give Rinku or Dinesh any individuality feels like an extra bit of condescension. When the three Indians are kicked out of their hotel and forced to live with J.B. what seemed like a cross between Jerry Maguire and The Air Up There suddenly starts to feel more like Big Daddy as the Indians presence stretches the emotionally immature and not-at-all-ready-for-surrogate-fatherhood J.B. to the breaking point. But true to form even though they may cramp his style these kids have a lot to teach J.B. about family and dedication. They also bring him closer to his neighbor/tenant the beautiful and sassy Brenda (Lake Bell doing way more than expected with a thankless love-interest role). At one point the five of them watch Gary Cooper in Pride of the Yankees together Brenda dabbing her eyes the three kids asleep at her and J.B.s feet. Its like a little family - and wed get the point even without lines like ""This whole alternative-family thing it looks good on you."" You keep waiting for the film to underplay something; its exhausting and futile. Director Craig Gillespie (whose filmography ranges from Lars and the Real Girl to um Mr. Woodcock) doesnt appear to have a subtle bone in his body but maybe thats not what a sports movie needs. There isnt a single scene of actual baseball in Million Dollar Arm but it seems to understand something fundamental about our attraction to sports that ritual is the key to building anticipation. So for all that I did find myself audibly responding -- sighing in frustration at their failure giggling like a dope at their success -- when Rinku and Dinesh finally got their shots at the big leagues. Million Dollar Arm might be simple scatterbrained and coarse but it knows a thing or two about the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat as they say.

SHAWNA RICHER The Globe and Mail Published Friday May 16 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday May 16 2014 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Craig Gillespie Written by Tom McCarthy Starring Jon Hamm Madhur Mittal Suraj Sharma and Lake Bell Classification PG Year 2014 Country USA Language English Craig Gillespie the director of Million Dollar Arm Walt Disney Studioss latest sports movie spent many years in the advertising racket crafting visual pitches for Altoids and Snickers bars Bud Light and boxer shorts by Fruit of the Loom.So its not a stretch that Gillespie (Lars and the Real Girl Fright Night) would land behind the camera for the kind of film that succeeds or fails on its ability to sell hard a number of things - hope dreams and inspiration packaged as blood sweat and tears. Million Dollar Arm is based on the true story of two teenage boys from Lucknow India Dinesh Patel (Madhur Mittal) and Rinku Singh (Suraj Sharma) and J.B. Bernstein the sports agent who tries to turn them into major league pitchers in the most postmodern way possible.Jon Hamm who has been televisions top leading man for more than six seasons as Don Draper on Mad Men is in his first leading role on the big screen. He is one star athlete away from losing his livelihood and the splendid lifestyle it bankrolls (Porsche impeccable bachelor crib fetching suits and an endless parade of dumb models smart enough to slip out the front door at dawn.)The movie opens with Bernstein desperate after watching his only potential signing a flaky NFL linebacker named Popo bolting for a rival agency when he cant deliver a million-dollar signing bonus.Bernstein who hasnt signed a new athlete in three years cant pay the rent on his office. He hasnt signed a new client in three years. He cant pay his bills. He likes nice things. His nice things are threatened. This is his motivation.One night while wallowing on his black leather sofa with a bottle of beer he becomes transfixed channel surfing between Britains Got Talent hopeful Susan Boyle and her show-stopper I Dreamed A Dream and an Indian cricket match. Inspiration strikes. Why not foist a talent search on an enormous untapped market of young men who can throw a ball?A Hollywood take on sports at least in Disneys hands only succeeds if we are made to believe that anything is possible that dreams are realized that adversity makes us stronger that any and all odds can be overcome. Baseball because it is historically seen as the most romantic of the sports has proven the toughest challenge for filmmakers. Purists are finicky. The game has inspired some of the best sports movies and some of the worst. Scripts can be saccharine full of cliches. Sort of like reality talent shows. A mash-up seemed natural. But this is no more a film about baseball than it is a film about cricket.Bernstein with the help of his assistant Aash (Aasif Mandvi) concocts a contest that will discover baseballs next great pitcher and save his career. Travelling across India with a narcoleptic major league scout (played for delight by Alan Arkin) is a nightmare. All the predictable problems - noise pollution crowds dysentery - ensue. What also occurs more slowly is the realization that cricket bowlers and baseball pitchers arent the same thing. None of the kids that come out - and the contest is mobbed everywhere they go - can throw over 40 mph (64 km/h) or within a mile of the strike zone.Then Bernstein meets Patel and Singh who despite their odd mechanics can throw a perfect strike more than 83 mph. They say farewell to their families and head to Los Angeles with Bernstein where they have six months to prepare for a major league tryout.After one unwise unsupervised night in a hotel Bernstein moves the boys into his place. They are befriended by his neighbour Brenda (Lake Bell) a medical student who becomes a den mother to the boys and romantic foil to Bernstein.Its not until they land in L.A. that Bernstein learns that both boys hate cricket - one is a javelin thrower and the other plays field hockey. He takes them to USCs baseball stadium to work with the team and watches them become acquainted with a baseball mitt. Singh has a Karate Kid-meets-pink-flamingo windup. Oh and they cant find the side of a barn with a baseball.The boys are homesick. Bernstein ignores them while he tries to reclaim his L.A. life. An eventual major league tryout in a strip mall is a disaster.Their coach Tom House (Bill Paxton) realizes they need to be having more fun. Bernsteins neighbour and love interest Brenda (played by Lake Bell) realizes they need to feel more like a family. It takes a village to raise a baseball pitcher.""If they are your last best shot why dont you pay more attention to them?"" Brenda asks J.B. ""You just need to commit.""And there it is in five words. Redemption begins in earnest. Bernstein trades his Porsche for a white mini-van starts cooking the kids breakfast does their laundry watches them practice. They start to perform better. Brenda and J.B. start to fall for each other. J.B. hustles another tryout for the boys which turns out much better.The role while hardly a stretch for Hamms acting ability doesnt challenge him either. Charming and easy on the senses Hamm seems comfortable and maybe thats what he was looking for in a big-screen debut.It doesnt fail but it never actually reaches its potential. This is more the fault of the script written by Tom McCarthy (The Station Agent) than the actor.Hamm and Bell are likeable actors with terrific timing. The location shots in Mumbai are beautiful chaotic and jarring. The script is amusing.Hamm recently told an interviewer that acting and athletics have no measure in common; that you can either hit a curveball or you cant but that acting is in the eye of the beholder. Hamm who plays catcher in a Hollywood mens league understands the game and is good but not great. It is how his role feels good but not great through no fault of his own.Disney has made a few sports films that tug right on the emotions - The Rookie Miracle Remember the Titans - and Million Dollar Arm is an easy addition to the canon.Sports at their best explore the soar and crush of human endeavour. Its what lifts fans from their seats and evokes cheers and tears. In real life it can be enough to embrace your team through its ups and downs. But in a film where the camera hones in on character those characters must come alive. And the best ones in the film - Patel and Singh - never quite reach their potential that way.The movie is about expectations the ones we have for ourselves and those we impose on others life lessons learned better late than never. Its a soft and sweet story a small film about big honest ideas about dreaming a dream. Its charming and inspirational.Where it falls short is that the films most compelling characters - Patel and Singh - are faintly unfinished and underexplored. It may well have worked better as pure documentary and it will send many moviegoers on a mission to Google where they will learn more about the real stars of the picture.Shawna Richer is Sports Editor of The Globe and Mail.

Grade C+ What happened to the old Hollywood-Broadway notion that movies about cultural exchange should show it going both ways? You could learn more about Thai history from watching ""The King and I"" than you glean about contemporary India from ""Million Dollar Arm."" This superficially affable movie tells the fact-inspired story of hard-driving sports agent J.B. Bernstein (Jon Hamm) who starts an Indian reality-TV show also called ""Million Dollar Arm"" to find raw pitching talent that he can refine and market back home to the major leagues. Accompanied by a comically saturnine American scout (Alan Arkin) and a farcically eager Indian assistant (Pitobash) he crisscrosses the Indian subcontinent and comes up with two winners Rinku Singh (played by ""Life of Pis"" Suraj Sharma) and Dinesh Patel (played by Madhur Mittal who was the heros brother in ""Slumdog Millionaire""). Unable to deal with the complexity of Los Angeles hotels - even elevators are new to the young Indians - they end up living in Bernsteins home. They erect a prayer shrine practice yoga and eventually get Bernstein to join in. But their real function is to open the agents eyes to the joys of family. Like Hindu cupids they nudge Bernstein into seeing that he should marry the medical student who rents his guesthouse (Lake Bell) though he usually dates supermodels. Of course Brenda is as svelte as a supermodel and also smart and funny. Especially as played by Bell she operates as emotional insurance for the filmmakers Whenever Bernstein acts too hopelessly careerist you figure well if Brenda likes him hell turn out OK. Hamm doesnt embarrass himself as Bernstein but the role is hollow - a savvy guy who needs to learn how nice and lovable he can be. Early on the movie wrings humor from Indian driving and bureaucracy. Bernstein learns that Indian businessmen love two things - honking their horns and ""bypassing the system."" But the only real jolt to his preconceptions comes when he discovers his two recruits dont play or enjoy cricket. He feels that hes giving them a shot at the American Dream and their one chance to dream at all. The movie views their work ethic as their way to lift their village families from poverty. It rarely connects their bravery commitment and idealism to any aspect of their native culture. Director Craig Gillespie and writer Tom McCarthy turn Bernsteins true story into one more upscale underdog fable about a Type A man who regains his professional zest after he kicks his addiction to work. (Can this truly be the most pernicious problem in Western life? Even in the ludicrously overrated ""Locke"" the heros obsession with pouring concrete blinds him to his family problems.) REALITY CHECK My post-viewing experience with ""Million Dollar Arm"" was similar to the one I had with ""Belle."" I read the nonfiction book designed to tie in with the movie shook my head over the altered facts and then was stunned by an afterword in which the author - in this case Bernstein himself - insisted that the movie ""feels authentic."" Really? Bernstein writes that he and Ash Vasudevan (Aasif Mandvi) were not partners in a struggling sports agency - Ash was and is a venture capitalist and Bernsteins agency had been a roaring success. Even on the movies own sappy terms wouldnt Bernsteins recognition of his need for a family have been even more powerful if he were shown already sitting pretty financially not desperate for a big attention-getting deal? As with ""Belle"" my point isnt that the historical truth is simply better. By changing the record in broad sentimental ways moviemakers divorce their films further from individualistic comedy and drama and propel them into a wispy fairy-tale realm. Bernsteins true love Brenda was ""a champion horseback rider"" and the founder of ""a multimillion dollar company"" not a med student and the boys didnt meet her until she and Bernstein started living together. But if Brenda in the movie werent a scrappy unpretentious medic the film wouldnt have yet another Cinderella story.

"Million Dollar Arm tosses out a nice softball - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Million Dollar Arm tosses out a nice softball Million Dollar Arm Ishika Mohan / Disney Jon Hamm in a scene from ""Million Dollar Arm."" Jon Hamm in a scene from ""Million Dollar Arm."" (Ishika Mohan / Disney) Critic Kenneth Turan says Jon Hamm is especially effective in the genial and enjoyable Million Dollar Arm You can see the stuff ""Million Dollar Arm"" throws at you from miles away but that doesnt stop this baseball movie from being genially enjoyable. An example of the pleasant things that can happen when a better class of people work on Disney family films it makes touching all the bases feel like fun.Based on a true story so improbable you might not believe it at all except for the reality footage shown at the end ""Million Dollar Arm"" is built around the charismatic presence of Jon Hamm ""Mad Mens"" Don Draper but its off-screen strengths include two people who are not household words screenwriter Tom McCarthy and director Craig Gillespie. McCarthy whose character-driven writing credits include ""The Station Agent"" and ""Win Win"" two fine films he also directed himself and Gillespie best known for Ryan Goslings underappreciated ""Lars and the Real Girl"" combine to give the film a spirit that is amusing and warm-hearted without being excessively cloying.""Million Dollar Arms"" focus is on J.B. Bernstein (Hamm) a sports agent who used to toil for the soul-destroying Procorp (he calls it ""the Death Star"") but is now working with Indian American good friend Ash (""The Daily Shows"" Aasif Mandvi) in his own small firm. The only trouble is said firm is not doing so well and efforts to sign a self-absorbed pro linebacker (former USC player Rey Maualuga) keep hitting snags. Then Bernstein (""desperate men try desperate things"") gets a brainstorm. Related story Million Dollar Arms real stars make wild pitch pay off Amy Kaufman The two Indian athletes on which the film is based parlayed their strong arms and an agents dream into security for their families. The two Indian athletes on which the film is based parlayed their strong arms and an agents dream into security for their families. (Amy Kaufman) Riffing off his partners childhood memories of watching cricket Bernstein determines to go to India find capable young cricketers through talent contests bring them to the U.S. and turn them into ace major league hurlers. ""A billion people play this game"" he enthuses. ""Thats a billion new fans.""Unmarried because of his penchant for dating supermodels Bernstein turns to Brenda the medical student who rents his guest house to watch over things while he is gone. Engagingly played by Lake Bell (who worked with Hamm on ""Childrens Hospital"" back in the day) Brenda is attractive funny and smart but given the demands of this kind of story and Bernsteins supermodel predilections the agent is initially blind to her charms. Photos (By Christy Khoshaba) ""Million Dollar Arm"" spends a chunk of its time in India vividly photographed by Gyula Pados to an A.R. Rahman soundtrack and its scenes of the crowds and competition give the film a bit of a ""Slumdog Millionaire"" flavor. Much more familiar is Ray Poitevint the cranky old major league scout Bernstein hires to help him figure out whos got talent. As played by the always amusing Alan Arkin Poitevint is so savvy he can tell how fast a prospect is pitching by the sound the ball makes hitting the catchers glove.Bernstein and company come up with two players Rinku (""Life of Pis"" Suraj Sharma) and Dinesh (Madhur Mittal) and bring them back to L.A. where the more serious part of the film begins. Never having so much as seen a major league game the guys have to learn to play which is where USC coach Tom House (Bill Paxton) comes in. Helped by enthusiastic translator Amit (Pitobash) the guys also have to learn about all the things ranging from elevators to pizza they have never seen in rural India.Because this is a Disney family film after all its not just the young ballplayers who will be learning a thing or two. Self-centered supermodel-dating (is there any family film sin greater than that?) J.B. will learn some stuff as well.Used to putting the deal before everything else J.B. will come to understand with a little help from Brenda that he has a personal responsibility to the young men he brought over from India and ended up installing in his own house. He has to pay more attention to these prospects as people if he wants them to perform well as athletes.While this sounds rather gee whiz as written by McCarthy directed by Gillespie and performed by a strong cast ""Million Dollar Arm"" doesnt push. Especially effective is star Hamm who displays an easy charm and nice comic instincts in a role that fits him like a broken-in glove. Watching someone become more of an adult is rarely painless but ""Million Dollar Arm"" makes the lessons go down easy.kenneth.turanlatimes.com------------Million Dollar ArmMPAA rating PG for mild language and some suggestive contentRunning time 2 hours 6 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Column Reviews Entertainment Foreign Exchange Market Bill Paxton Slumdog Millionaire (movie) Godzilla to devour weekend box-office competition Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-million-dollar-arm-review-20140516-column.html,200,milliondollararm8,milliondollararm,latimes

Ron Phillips/Walt Disney Pictures hide caption toggle caption Ron Phillips/Walt Disney Pictures Aasif Mandvi (left) and Jon Hamm check out the talent in Million Dollar Arm. Ron Phillips/Walt Disney Pictures Where does Don Drapers formidable presence come from in Mad Men? From his impeccable style sure and from his brooding good looks of course but also from his stillness. A few drug-induced exceptions aside Don is as restrained in movement as he is in his speech. The combination gives him an irresistible if unsettling allure; in meetings its his solid stare that holds your attention as much as his words. Jon Hamms stillness playing Don in Mad Men became particularly noticeable after I watched him in Million Dollar Arm which among other things lacks a noteworthy performance to ground an otherwise loosely constructed film. Hamm doesnt play Don in Million Dollar Arm of course but he does play another salesman the sports agent JB who after leaving a large agency to start his own business is struggling to sign a big-name athlete and pay his bills. In fact Million Dollar Arm -- based on a true story -- begins with a pitch from JB to a superstar NFL linebacker he hopes to represent. JB doesnt quite offer the same satisfactions as Don though. Hes something closer to Jerry Maguire in need of an editor concluding his promise to secure countless riches with a supplication ""Will you let me help you do that?"" JB leads a hurried existence rushing around LA in his Porsche convertible. Eventually he takes that energy to India where with the prospect of a billion new baseball fans on his mind he hopes to save his career by converting Indian cricket bowlers into professional pitchers. To that end he holds a contest called Million Dollar Arm offering two finalists an opportunity to try out for the major leagues in the U.S. And when the winners Rinku (Suraj Sharma) and Dinesh (Madhur Mittal) return with JB to LA one of the first English words they learn is the essence of JBs way of life hustle. Looking at Hamms previous roles you can chart his range by whether his characters default to a smile or a stone-faced stare. If deadpan hes Don -- assertive composed unflappable. With a smile -- which unlike most things about Hamm is generally strained and awkward -- he flips Now hes goofy and approachable characteristics he used to great effect on 30 Rock. Either way he has presence. In Million Dollar Arm he disappears. And hes not the only one Between director Craig Gillespie (Lars and the Real Girl) writer Thomas McCarthy (The Station Agent) and co-stars Bill Paxton Alan Arkin and Lake Bell (who is good enough to make you realize how wasteful her love-interest-as-motherly-sidekick role is) theres a lot of potential talent subsumed here by plain studio fare. Whoever you want to blame Million Dollar Arm is a film that like JB is in a needless rush. This isnt the hurry of a tense thriller. Instead with time to kill the film resembles a long car ride with McCarthy and Gillespie producing the closest approximations to excitement possible so no one realizes theyre bored. The scenes in India stuff a series of montages in between jokes about animals roaming the streets and a brief preposterous stop at the Taj Mahal. (A Disney movie isnt where one ought to search for nuanced multiculturalism of course and here at least both sides are reduced to stereotypes America is baseball luxury and cultural insensitivity; India is spicy food crowded streets and poverty.) In other moments when a montage is too clearly out of the question the film resorts to sudden leaps in time anything that is but a stop for breath. In the end Hamm is most affected -- theres a strain to his performance that suggests something about JB perhaps but also strips the character of any charisma. As a result Million Dollar Man may be the first hint that Hamm is unable to rise above mediocre material and demand our attention regardless (an essential feature of any leading Hollywood actor or actress). But before passing judgment Id like to see a film that lets him sit still and prove otherwise.

Starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson Elizabeth Olsen and Bryan Cranston. (Photo/Video Warner Bros.) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com May 15 2014 238 p.m. ET 0 COMMENTS Patience is a virtue and youll need lots of it during the first half of ""Godzilla"" which threatens to be a lizardly variant of ""Waiting for Godot."" First theres Bryan Cranston in full obsessive mode and a fright wig slowly sussing out a secret. No he isnt obsessed with cooking meth but with uncovering whatever it is Japanese authorities have been hiding on the site of a nuclear power plant that was destroyed by something--some thing--15 years ago. Then theres the schematic struggle between Mr. Cranstons Joe Brody who managed the ill-fated plant and his son Ford a military bomb-disposal expert who thinks his old man is completely bonkers. (Ford is played blandly by Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Elizabeth Olsen doubles down on the blandness as Fords wife.) When the film finally gets around to monsters on a rampage youll get both more and less than you bargained for. More because in the tradition of the 60-year-old series Godzilla is not the only oyster in the stew. Humanity must also contend in this version with giant MUTOs--massive unidentified terrestrial organisms--that look like they were sculpted by Louise Bourgeois; that feed voraciously on radiation with Paris and Las Vegas for dessert; and are in the mood for mating if not love. (You can tell from the atomic glow of their sexual organs. When these creatures are in heat they are really in heat.) And less because the star of the show doesnt have anything to do until almost an hour has drifted by. Before that we get plenty of speculation about whether hes mankinds scourge or savior. The latter notion is advanced by Ken Watanabes Dr. Ichiro Serizawa a Japanese scientist who believes Godzilla has been aroused from his primeval slumber to restore balance in nature and who advocates letting the big guy duke it out with the lustful MUTOs. And duke it out they do in a San Francisco where fires rage and panic spreads while skyscrapers fall like digitized dominoes. The climactic combat is very loud and fitfully impressive when it isnt being intercut with Strangelovian silliness about a nuclear warhead that only Ford Brody knows how to disarm. (The director was Gareth Edwards who made a name for himself four years ago with a modest but effective alien-invasion flick called ""Monsters."" Seamus McGarvey was the cinematographer.) No one can accuse ""Godzilla"" of lacking plot elements or themes. The patchwork script which is credited to Max Borenstein resonates with the meltdown at Fukushima and the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004; borrows freely from official behavior in ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind""; separates families reunites them finds Ford a little kid to protect when hes off on his own; and offers the ingenious theory that the hydrogen bomb tests in the Pacific in the 1950s werent tests but attempts to kill MUTOs. But the more elements the movie piles on the more diffuse and disjointed it becomes. Whether or not Godzilla returned to save us his series may finally be beyond salvation. Watch a clip from the film ""Million Dollar Arm."" Starring Jon Hamm Aasif Mandvi and Alan Arkin. (Photo/Video Disney) Million Dollar Arm Disneys ""Million Dollar Arm"" presents a particularly flagrant case of a true story reprocessed into a feel-good fable that rings false. A sports agent JB Bernstein (Jon Hamm) needs a fresh idea that will turn his languishing business around. Hes dismissive at first when an Indian associate points him toward the world of cricket. ""It looks like an insane asylum opened up"" JB says of the game ""and all the inmates were allowed to start their own sport."" Before long though hes in India staging reality-show competitions to find a cricket player who has the right stuff to become a Major League Baseball pitcher. The movie is grimly efficient on its own terms a string of ever more naked calculations. But it looks like a business school opened up and all the marketing grads were allowed to start their own studio. The main calculation concerns the agents character traits. (I was going to say his character but he doesnt have one until the very end.) Since Mr. Hamm is indelibly identified with Don Draper the deeply flawed but still charming protagonist of ""Mad Men"" the goal here was to fashion JB along the same lines. They got the deeply flawed part right. JBs flaws start and end with insensitivity. Its funny enough in a Don Draper way that he fixates on a plastic girlfriend and ignores his lovely tenant Brenda (Lake Bell) a physician who lives in his guest house. (Ms. Bell who made and starred in ""In a World..."" is too talented and original to be trapped in the nervous self-apologetic stereotype thats beginning to define her.) But it isnt funny at all only stupid and inexplicable that he treats his Indian athletes--he finds two promising candidates plus a would-be coach--with callous neglect after transplanting them from their rural villages to Los Angeles where they flounder like the out-of-water fish they are. ""Million Dollar Arm"" works as a parable of colonial exploitation but that may not be exactly what Disney intended even though theres a brief acknowledgment that throwing vast amounts of money at unworldly village boys isnt in their best interests. The movies obsessive intention is to dramatize JBs growth from insensitive clod to the nicest of nice guys. This transformation takes place belatedly and mechanically with the help of a crusty old baseball scout played--unfunnily--by Alan Arkin and with emotional coaching from Brenda who opens JBs eyes and soul to the plight of his tender new clients ""They just need to see that you care."" I needed to see that the movie cared about the boys Dinesh and Rinku theyre played respectively by Madhur Mittal from ""Slumdog Millionaire"" and Suraj Sharma who was Pi Patel in ""Life of Pi."" But theyre used as amiable sitcom props and never get to say a single word about baseball--how they feel about the new sport theyve been drafted to play how theyre able to throw a ball so well. (In fact the winners of J.B. Bernsteins real-life talent hunt had never played cricket. While the production respects that awkward fact Disneys marketing campaign suggests otherwise.) The film was directed by Craig Gillespie from a script by Thomas McCarthy though the coarse texture of whats on screen suggests that the studio imposed its iron will on two artists who have made fine independent films in the past and will surely make more of them in the future. The New York African Film Festival Watch a clip from the film ""Half of a Yellow Sun."" Starring Chiwetel Ejiofor Thandie Newton and Anika Noni Rose. (Photo/Video Monterey Media) With Nigeria beset by the savagery of Boko Haram the timing would seem to be right for ""Half of a Yellow Sun"" a drama set in the 1960s during the Nigerian civil war when that nations southeastern provinces tried to secede in a doomed effort to establish the Republic of Biafra. Whats more the film now in limited commercial release stars Chiwetel Ejiofor last seen in ""12 Years a Slave"" as well as the always appealing Thandie Newton. After seeing it as part of a series of African films presented by the Film Society of Lincoln Center Im sorry to report that Biyi Bandeles would-be saga based on the celebrated novel by Chimamanda Ngozie Adichie is disappointing a romance pastiche that muddles the politics of the period beyond comprehension. But the Lincoln Center series included other features and documentaries that deserve to be seen widely. Among them ""Bastards"" In Muslim countries illegitimate children are usually outcasts. Deborah Perkins feature documentary (not to be confused with the 2013 drama of the same name by Claire Denis) follows Rabha El Haimer a single mother in Morocco as she struggles for official recognition of her religious marriage which has no legal standing--she was 14 when her parents gave her away to a brute who beat her regularly. Once that is accomplished Rabha hopes her daughter Salma can have the full benefits of citizenship. The legal system moves slowly but in the end justice is done. ""Winter of Discontent"" The 2011 uprising that began in Cairos Tahrir Square is powerfully depicted in a 2012 fiction film by the Egyptian director Ibrahim El-Batout. The pace is deliberate so that the evil of the Mubarak regimes security apparatus can exude fully. (Neither the filmmaker nor his activist hero Amr played by Amr Waked could have guessed that the apparatus would survive the revolution intact.) The torture scenes are chilling but so in their way are the workings of the state-run television station which tries to keep a lid on a boiling cauldron by spewing shameless lies. ""Sarraounia"" This fascinating dramatic film by the Algerian director Med Hondo was produced sumptuously in 1986. Its a fictionalized account of the reign of Queen Sarraounia who battled French colonialists at the turn of the 20th century in what is now Niger. The French come off as contemptible swine. They arent defeated by the queen as much as by their own moral corruption but Sarraounia (Ai Keita) tall and supremely self-confident is a formidable force who enunciates a stirring credo. ""Our community is tolerant"" she declares. ""Everyone lives according to his customs and principles. Worship any god you please--sky earth fire lightning or the crocodiles. Pray any way you like. Your soul is your own responsibility.""

Bernstein (Jon Hamm) in ""Million Dollar Arm."" The prospects bring Amit (Pitobash) right with them to the states. (Ron Phillips) By Ann Hornaday May 15 2014 Follow AnnHornaday In a movie culture increasingly dominated by niche audiences theres a special place of honor reserved for that rare film that can appeal to just about everyone. ""Million Dollar Arm"" an easygoing and unpretentiously entertaining baseball drama is just that kind of film one that tells a terrific story by way of an appealing cast handsome production values and a warm unaffected tone. Jon Hamm plays J.B. Bernstein a Los Angeles sports agent who has recently started his own firm but faces imminent shuttering if he doesnt snag a major client. While channel surfing one night he toggles between an Indian cricket match and Susan Boyle warbling ""I Dreamed a Dream"" on ""Britains Got Talent"" and he hits on his golden ticket Hell stage a contest in India in search of a cricket bowler with enough speed accuracy and power to become a major league baseball pitcher. You can almost hear the Disney pitch meeting ""Its Jerry Maguire meets Slumdog Millionaire boss its gonna be huge"" Except this particular tale has its roots in a real-life story first brought to light by sports producers Neil and Michael Mandt. Beautifully adapted by screenwriter Thomas McCarthy (""The Visitor"" ""Win Win"") and director Craig Gillespie (""Lars and the Real Girl"") ""Million Dollar Arm"" doesnt break the familiar mold of come-from-behind sports movies -- indeed it obeys every convention of the genre. But it does so with understatement style and an exceptional group of actors who bring just the right balance of humor and restraint to their roles. Both of those qualities matter most when Bernstein travels to India where his local fixer immediately informs him that preparations for the contest are running ""on time and smoothly"" concepts that Bernstein soon learns are relative in Mumbai where negotiations are more apt to take place in a clogged city street with a quiet bribe than with lawyers and contracts. (As luck would have it Bernstein has left his Indian American partner Aash played by Asif Maandvi back in L.A. with vomiting twins.) Soon ""Million Dollar Arm"" hits the road in an eye-popping travelogue through the Indian countryside where Bernstein and his scout a grizzled compulsive napper named Ray (Alan Arkin) audition thousands of young men each seemingly possessed of a wilder weaker arm than the last. Eventually two possibilities emerge Rinku (Suraj Sharma) an eager javelin thrower who strikes a yogalike pose before throwing the ball and Dinesh (Madhur Mittal) a solemn laborer whose filial duties to his father cant compete with dreams of success in America. When Bernstein brings the guys back for training what might have been a facile fish-out-of-water romp instead becomes a sobering portrait of subtle and not-so-subtle exploitation as well as Bernsteins own dawning awareness of the wages of single-minded ambition. His tense face rarely breaking into a smile his voice a hoarse growl Hamm makes for an unusually recessive leading man in ""Million Dollar Arm""; he doesnt have the native charm of George Clooney or the sharp-edged charisma of Tom Cruise both of whom might have played Bernstein as a rakishly disarming sharpie. But if that vaguely unlikable persona doesnt make Hamm a natural movie star it suits his character who frankly isnt that sympathetic when hes briskly telling his charges to hurry up and work harder even as theyre clearly suffering from homesickness and profound isolation. Luckily Rinku and Dinesh have brought along their own fixer a motor-mouthed baseball fan named Amit played by the diminutive Bollywood star Pitobash. And Bernstein has some voices of reason in his own life namely a compassionate USC pitching coach played by Bill Paxton and the conveniently beautiful woman named Brenda who happens to be renting his carriage house. A scotch-drinking straight-talking medical student Brenda becomes an essential element in ""Million Dollar Arm"" not because of the obvious love-interest opportunity she presents but because she is portrayed by the magnificent Lake Bell who infuses an otherwise stock character with spiky spontaneous energy and tomboyish sex appeal. ""Million Dollar Arm"" doesnt delve too deeply into the inner lives or characterizations of Rinku and Dinesh preferring to skate along on a plot that involves the usual proportion of setbacks to moments of hard-won triumph. Still even fans who know how this story ends will enjoy a movie that choreographs the most predictable moments (such as a dinner party scene straight out of the rom-com playbook) with deftness and charm. ""Million Dollar Arm"" manages to be heartwarming and wholesome without condescending or pandering -- and tells a rousing good yarn in the bargain. For all those reasons it deserves a solid spot in the win column.    PG. At area theaters.

By Colin Covert Star Tribune May 15 2014 -- 247pm Disney Jon Hamm is more than just a charmer as a sports agent in ""Million Dollar Arm."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Million Dollar Arm"" is a baseball movie that pulls off a smooth triple play. Its a character-based comedy drama thats also a smart film about the business of sports. As if it werent difficult enough to work that double angle theres also an exotic international focus. The story concerns immigrant players struggling with social disorientation and homesickness an under-reported aspect of the game that has caused many a gifted recruit to fail. And by the way its all based on a true story. There are a lot of ideas in motion here but the thoughtful script by Tom McCarthy (of Pixars ""Up"") juggles them nimbly. McCarthy writes incisively about character and populates the story with people we like. He portrays the world of high-salary sports management as intensively competitive even cutthroat. We meet the films sort-of hero playboy sports agent J.B. Bernstein (Jon Hamm) at a point when his small firm is barely treading water. Bernstein is no idealist but neither is he a cynical jackal. Hamm makes him a complex figure a man with a conscience who also has bills to pay. And models to date. He can do wonders with the curve of a smile or an embarrassed silence. Unable to offer clients the million-dollar signing bonuses that big rival firms can deliver he scrambles for a new idea. With Alan Arkin on hand as a nap-prone retired MLB scout he travels to India on a talent hunt. Its an eye-opener for a man with a careerists tunnel vision. He cant fathom the game of cricket marveling ""It looks like an insane asylum opened up and all the inmates were allowed to play."" Eventually he harvests two stellar pitchers -- one a cricket bowler the other a javelin star -- and imports them to his Los Angeles home. He operates like an absentee father leaving them to their own devices at home while pushing them on the field. They dont thrive. Gradually he sees that his influence is not entirely healthy. Lake Bell plays the medical student who rents Bernsteins pool house and offers touchy-feely advice to the perplexed agent. Bill Paxton plays a sports psychologist who teaches the self-centered Bernstein to see his relationship with his young players as more than a simple business deal. The film unfolds as a coming-of-age story for a man who never quite grew up. MILLION DOLLAR ARM  Rating PG for mild language and some suggestive content. The film has its flaws. It dawdles to its foregone conclusion leaving viewers in need of a seventh-inning stretch. And it could devote more attention to the young Indian hopefuls. Madhur Mittal and Suraj Sharma are engaging but play almost interchangeable roles. Aasif Mandvi as Bernsteins confident amusing Indian-American business partner gets much more to chew on. Even so the finished product is clever and sweetly entertaining. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Million Dollar Arm the true story of Indias first major league players review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesMillion Dollar Arm the true story of Indias first major league players reviewJohn Hamm stars in Million Dollar Arm Disneys latest true-story sports movie about two rural Indian kids who get their shot at the American Dream baseball style.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. May 15 2014Million Dollar ArmStarring Jon Hamm Suraj Sharma Madhur Mittal Lake Bell and Alan Arkin. Directed by Craig Gillespie. 124 minutes. Opening Friday at GTA theatres. PGEchoes of Jerry Maguire and Slumdog Millionaire ping through Million Dollar Arm Disneys latest inspirational true-story sports movie (Invincible Miracle) which gets partway to home base but fades by trading scrappy for sappy.Initially Million Dollar Arm appears about to bypass the predictability of a typical Cinderella story in its tale of two young men from rural India who get their shot at the American Dream baseball style.Article Continued BelowScreenwriter Thomas McCarthy (Win-Win a superior showcase of his talents) and Mad Mens Jon Hamm dont pull back from letting real-life L.A. sports agent J.B. Bernstein come across as less than heroic. In fact hes self-obsessed impatient and occasionally a 14-carat jerk. Jon Hamm stars as a baseball agent looking for help overseas in Million Dollar Arm. (  (Ishika Mohan / AP)  As Bernstein Hamm works a Don Draper scruff and a distractingly perpetually husky voice to play a slick dude who is hardly hitting them out of the park after starting his own agency with pal Ash (Aasif Mandvi).Broke unable to convince a big-name football player to ink a deal and loath to experience a halt to his supermodel-luring lifestyle Bernsteins channel-surfing exposure to cricket and TV contest songbird Susan Boyle fosters an idea to look for a major league pitching sensation in an unlikely place India.Fuelled by visions of Yao Ming doing slam dunks while bringing a whole new audience to the sport Bernstein assumes there is raw pitching talent among the cricket-crazy population. An India-wide American Idol-style competition called Million Dollar Arm promises big bucks to a winner and runner-up a trip to U.S. training camp and an eventual major league tryout.Set to Oscar winner A.R. Rahmans energetic score the movie sees Bernstein arrive in India and struggle to keep his dinners down and his spirits up. Accompanied on a multi-city tryout tour by agreeable local fixer Amit (Pitobash) and American baseball scout Ray (Alan Arkin playing yet another curmudgeon) hes shocked to realize that cricket bowlers dont present a wellspring of golden arms.Director Craig Gillespie (Lars and the Real Girl and TVs United States of Tara) pulls heartstrings effectively when the lads with Bernstein in tow make a final stop in their village to say goodbye to worried families. Gyula Padoss (The Duchess) gorgeous cinematography is never less than lovely but is less effective when the action switches to Atlanta (standing in for L.A.).Bernsteins nightly Skype chats with his guest house tenant Brenda (an underused Lake Bell) start out being about broken washing machines but evolve into something more. Could it be hes falling for the non-model? But Bernstein isnt one for nuance. Hes got a business to run.Rinku (Life of Pis Suraj Sharma) and Dinesh (Madhur Mittal of Slumdog Millionarie) are charming and completely likable as the eager-to-please naive rural guys who make the final cut. Theyre only too happy to let Bernstein take them to L.A. and treat them like annoyances until they pay off. When one upchucks in Bernsteins Porsche you want to applaud.After the obligatory fish-out-of-water encounters with elevators and a hotel fire alarm they end up bunking at Bernsteins place along with the eternally optimistic Amit. Bernstein embraces the role of absentee dad in this new dysfunctional family as Rinku and Dinesh struggle with homesickness and fear of failure.They cant grasp the mechanics of baseball. Truth is they dont even play cricket at home something Bernstein failed to ask them until they were en route to the airport. They feel terrible about letting their patron down but Bernstein only sees fleeing dollar signs.With Bill Paxtons baseball training guru sagely reminding Bernstein this is supposed to be fun and Brenda being the one to actually listen to the rookies while letting Bernstein know hes falling down on the job of being a decent person Million Dollar Arm makes a sudden shift into Disney territory. The self-absorbed sports agent discovers his conscience and theres a romantic dinner a deux being served by the pool.It all makes Million Dollar Arm a simple sports movie that is pleasing enough yet all-too forgettable. But theres that terrific soundtrack and watching Jon Hamm for two hours is hardly a waste of anybodys time.Read more about IndiaThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 216 p.m. EDT May 16 2014Jon Hamm stars as sports agent JB Bernstein in ""Million Dollar Arm.""(Photo Ishika Mohan Walt Disney Pictures)Jon Hamm knows how to play an opportunist intent on reinvention.From his rise and fall as Don Draper in Mad Men to his latest role as a sports agent trying to keep in the game Hamm is convincing as a charismatic schemer.Based on a true story Million Dollar Arm (1/2 out of four; rated PG opening Friday nationwide) has believable lead performances and a crowd-pleasing premise as written by talented screenwriter Tom McCarthy (The Visitor). But it comes off somewhat like a Jerry Maguire wannabe with a touch of Life of Pi.REVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theaters Better than some inspirational sports movies due mostly to its humor quotient and exotic Indian locations this baseball movie is hampered by a predictable storytelling style and not enough curve balls. It should have been more winning given that director Craig Gillespie also made the charming Lars and the Real Girl.For starters Hamms character sports agent JB Bernstein could have used even half the dimension that has made Draper so fascinating.Bernstein is watching his career tank. He needs some big-name clients or his business and glamorous lifestyle will become has-beens. A former top agent with a big firm his persuasive way with corporate types and athletes propelled him to launch his own firm. But his business acumen sometimes pushes his humanity out of the picture.JBs partner Aash (Aasif Mandvi) is a big fan of cricket. JB doesnt get the appeal. Then one night he comes up with a scheme that is more public relations stunt than sports event. The idea is born as he channel surfs and toggles between a cricket match and the TV show Britains Got Talent.Why not go to India and stage a nationwide contest to transform cricket bowlers into top-notch baseball pitchers? From there the big leagues will snatch up the winners -- or so JB surmises. As the world of professional athletics becomes increasingly globalized the Indian contest seems a wise idea. If Ichiro Suzuki could come from Japan to play in the major leagues then the same could happen to a talented rookie from a small Indian village.JB signs a deal with a deep-pocketed investor and off he goes to India to find a baseball star tucked away somewhere in the sub-continent.The musical score courtesy of Slumdog Millionaires Oscar-winning composer A.R. Rahman helps brings Indian cities like Jaipur and Bangalore to vivid life. Indeed scenes in India are the lively heart of the film. The soul comes through when the Indian transplants arrive in Los Angeles. Instead of indulging in cliched fish-out-of-water scenes the guys fall into a slump homesick and lonely for their families.JB is too self-absorbed to notice their malaise. It takes the wisdom of his tenant Brenda a tell-it-like-it-is medical student deftly played by Lake Bell to jolt him into realization. Both delightfully natural actors Hamm and Bell have an appealing chemistry which helps mitigate the predictability of the life lessons JB absorbs.Three Indian actors stand out though their characters could have used more development. As eager translator Amit Bollywood comic Pitobash has an irrepressible enthusiasm. The two young men who eventually win the contest Rinku (Life of Pi star Suraj Sharma) and Dinesh (Slumdog Millionaires Madhur Mittal) are engaging performers.When it focuses on the clash of cultures laughs naturally flow. When it follows the familiar sports movie playbook too slavishly it grows tedious.But everyone loves an underdog and the story capitalizes on that.Like JBs persona Million Dollar Arm is flawed but also slickly presented and likable. 8 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1gsbzvu",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/05/15/million-dollar-arm-review/8321809/,200,milliondollararm15,milliondollararm,usatoday

Sports agent J.B. Bernstein (Jon Hamm) has lost his mojo. Or rather hes lost his Popo (Rey Maualuga) a Samoan NFL star who was on the verge of signing with J.B.s two-man agency before a rival company intercepted him.With impatient investor Mr. Chang (Tzi Ma) breathing down J.B.s neck like a blitzing linebacker he and his partner Aash (Aasif Mandvi) scramble for a new business plan. During a drunken night of brainstorming at J.B.s bachelor pad Indian-American Aash turns the television to a cricket match and extols the popularity of the sport in his ancestral homeland. And suddenly J.B. gets a Disney-style flash of inspiration that could rival Flubber. Hell travel to India stage a publicity stunt and find a strong-armed cricket bowler to play major league baseball.But Aash has to stay home with his wife and twins so after J.B. lends his house keys to med student Brenda (Lake Bell) he arrives in roiling India without a paddle. Soon hes offered free flunky services by a chipper little baseball aficionado named Vivek (Darshan Jariwala) and theyre joined by a grumpy old baseball scout from America (Alan Arkin doing his usual curmudgeon routine) but its clear that the nationwide publicity campaign is attracting thousands of entrants who dont know baseball from baba ganoush. Yet after a basic boot camp the televised competition with the million-dollar prize produces two worthy young men javelin throwers Rinku (Suraj Sharma of ""Life of Pi"") and Dinesh (Madhur Mittal of ""Slumdog Millionaire"").""Million Dollar Arm"" is a true story and the impoverished boys trip to America where they learn baseball from a legendary college coach (Bill Paxton) and survival skills from J.B. is the most promising part of it. But their struggles with elevators slang and the effects of alcohol are played for easy laughs and their experiences are less important to the script than J.B.s. detour from the fast lane. Fortunately the script is by the talented Thomas McCarthy and enacted by the rock-solid Hamm and although this is a Disney crowd-pleaser the star of ""Mad Men"" doesnt completely discard his Don Draper persona for Fred McMurrays. Bell as J.B.s neighbor international Skype buddy and eventual love interest has the relatively thankless job of teaching him that hes treating the boys like pawns in his career gambit. ""Million Dollar Arm"" is as predictable as a 3-and-0 pitch down the middle but when its baseball season who wants dark clouds?What ""Million Dollar Arm""  Three stars out of four  Rating PG  Run time 204  Content Mild language and some suggestive content Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

"Million Dollar Arm (PG) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Million Dollar Arm (PG) Jon Hamm (""Mad Men"") stars in this feel-good sports drama about redemption. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle cogleMiamiHerald.com5/15/2014 Editor rating 3 Bats are made for swinging pennants are made for winning and strikeouts are made to thrill you (unless youre Crash Davis in Bull Durham; then theyre fascist). But the real lifeblood of the baseball movie -- of sports movies in general for that matter -- is redemption. Million Dollar Arm is all about redemption though there may be less baseball in it than you might expect. This clean-cut movie tells the story of an ambitious sports agent (Jon Hamm) who must learn that some things are more important than money or fame (also that dating models means you have no soul). But before you roll your eyes and groan about sentimentality know that the film is based on a true story and many of the unlikely events actually happened. That knowledge goes a long way toward making you more forgiving of the movies foregone conclusion. Hamm plays agent J.B. Bernstein a wheeler-dealer whose company is down on its luck. He needs a Big Idea to save it and gets one after a conversation about cricket with his colleague (Aasif Mandvi of The Daily Show). The plan Theyll stage a competition across India seeking cricket players to try out their pitching skills. The winners will be flown to the United States trained by a pro (Bill Paxton) and earn an audience with a major league baseball scout. Bernstein will get the glory new clients and open up a lucrative market for what he hopes will be an eternally grateful Major League Baseball. Nothing goes quite as planned but youll hardly be surprised by what happens. J.B. will be overwhelmed by the noise and traffic and bureaucracy of India at first then come to appreciate its unique beauty. Hell find his winners (Suraj Shama of Life of Pi and Madhur Mittal of Slumdog Millionaire) and get them to America where fish-out-of-water comedy and drama will ensue. J.B. will soon start to think more about responsibility than success and the doctor-in-training whos renting his backyard apartment (Lake Bell) will stop looking like a tenant and more like a leading lady. The signs are not hard to read Happy ending ahead. But due to its good humor and terrific story Million Dollar Arm is always engaging; its power lies in its feel-good charm. Its formula is a proven winner and the movie has a formidable team behind it. The producers are responsible for Miracle and The Rookie two rousing crowd-pleasing sports films. Screenwriter Thomas McCarthy wrote Win Win The Visitor and The Station Agent. Director Craig Gillespie (Mr. Woodcock) helmed the quirky Lars and the Real Girl. Their teamwork runs smoothly and the cast is amiable and funny. The movie is warm and sweet and surprisingly short of speeches extolling the magic of baseball while still reminding us why our national pastime always looks so appealing in the movies. Cast Jon Hamm Aasif Mandvi Lake Bell Alan Arkin Bill Paxton Suraj Sharma Madhur Mittal. Director Craig Gillespie. Screenwriter Thomas McCarthy. A Walt Disney Pictures release. Running time 124 minutes. Mild language some suggestive content. Opens Friday May 16 at area theaters. Related Links Showtimes Jon Hamm talks about the making of ""Million Dollar Arm.""

Photo John Johnson Walt Disney Pictures Million Dollar Arm review A fake-true baseball tale 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Million Dollar Arm Drama. Starring Jon Hamm Lake Bell and Alan Arkin. Directed by Craig Gillespie. (PG. 124 minutes.) The funny thing about true stories is that they often seem phonier than fiction especially when the subjects are still alive and can sue or get angry or have their feelings hurt. Even when characters are imperfect and need to learn serious life lessons you see their perfection inside their imperfection like a diamond waiting to be liberated. Their lessons can only be easy and voluntary and their transformations complete. ""Million Dollar Arm"" is in that odd fake-true category. Its the story of JB Bernstein a sports agent and his plan to recruit from India two baseball pitchers that he would groom and ultimately sign to the major leagues. He found two guys who could really throw whod previously never before held a baseball. ""Million Dollar Arm"" is part culture-clash and part sports story taking place partly in India though mainly in the United States. Jon Hamm plays JB and he is the movies strongest asset and its only unalloyed advantage. Alan Arkin is in the movie too but he sleeps through the role - this time literally. That is he sleeps through the role of someone who is sleeping most of the time. And Lake Bell who seems to have been given one direction to be absolutely delightful cant stop smiling all over herself as Brenda JBs tenant. She is the saintly voice of happy truth. More in Movies Impossible Light The inside story of Bay Lights project Palo Alto review Truthful but not insightful Tasting Menu review Not a recipe for success Within minutes the movies ending is apparent and inevitable even to someone who knows nothing of the real story. (Actually the real story is a lot more complicated and mixed than the fairy tale you get here.) But the movie takes forever to get there. How could a little story like this get stretched to 124 minutes? Its at least 30 minutes too long. The fish-out-of-water stuff - JBs discomfort in India the ballplayers awkwardness in the United States - is squeezed for every laugh then squeezed twice more for laughs that arent there. It all feels labored. In fact very little of the comedy raises even a smile. Part of the problem is that its difficult to see JBs efforts as worth it. The idea of creating major-league pitchers from thin air seems far-fetched and its really hard to care about the solvency of JBs business. Yes we can wish him well but wishing him well enough to sit and wish for 124 minutes is too much wishing for anyone outside the immediate family. Yet if anyone can make us feel something for JB its Hamm who as on ""Mad Men"" has the ability to suggest something substantial beneath the superficial something real underneath the slick surface. Hamm makes ""Million Dollar Arm"" watchable but not so watchable as to quash the impulse to check the time every five minutes. Thats the problem with cell phones taking over for wristwatches. You cant check the time anymore without getting thrown out of the theater. By the way the name ""Million Dollar Arm"" does not refer to anyones arm in particular and no one gets a million dollars. Also note that getting signed to a major-league organization is not the same as getting signed to a major-league team. Look out for the smoke and mirrors.

Director Biyi Bandele (153). R Sexuality violence. Quad. Those who only know Chiwetel Ejiofor from his quietly powerful work in the Best Picture-winning ""12 Years a Slave"" should see him here -- to experience his range. In ""12 Years"" we saw a world of emotion play across his face. In ""Half of a Yellow Sun"" his performance as a volatile revolutionary conflicted professor shows other aspects of this great actors talent. Unfortunately the movie gets bogged down in soap opera-ish dynamics. Personal crises play out against a nation torn apart. In Nigeria in the 1960s twin daughters of a tribal chief go their own ways after receiving an education that includes Oxford and Yale. Free-spirited Kainene (a very good Anika Noni Rose) winds up a successful businesswoman linked to a weak-willed British writer (Joseph Mawle). Olanna (Thandie Newton) walks a line between domesticity and support for the rebel forces in Nigerias burgeoning civil war. Olannas lover-turned-husband is Odenigbo (Ejiofor) a man with a messy personal life but a fevered political soul. As the country falls to violence Olanna Odenigbo and their children must find a way to support the idea of -- and survive the actual creation of -- an independent state. Director Biyi Bandeles sense of tension here is solid and accomplished though a few too many actual newsreels are mixed in as narrative shorthand. Cinematic forerunners like ""Doctor Zhivago"" and ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"" come to mind. Like those ""Sun"" is based on a novel and the scope is at times too epic. The heightened emotions though are in the hands of a strong cast. On a mobile device? Click to watch the trailer.

"Million Dollar Arm movie review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Million Dollar Arm  Million Dollar Arm Ron Phillips Disney Jon Hamm in ""Million Dollar Arm."" Jon Hamm in ""Million Dollar Arm."" (Ron Phillips Disney) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Partly its the granite chin and the ever-so-slightly self-congratulatory grin just above it. Partly its his signature role the duplicitous hollow man Don Draper on ""Mad Men"" the role Jon Hamm has been fortunate enough to explore the past few years.Whatever the factors Hamm may always have to guard against a certain self-regard on camera a mild-to-moderate case of peacock-itis. The actor like many a well-known star before him has the blessing and the sometime curse of the ridiculously attractive. The curse of the ridiculously attractive is one that crosses genders and if the performer isnt careful -- if the performer appears to be living waiting dying for the next close-up -- ensnares performers all across the talent spectrum. Hamms talented though and has done all right in movies up until now in supporting roles often as the good-looking heel scuffing up the protagonist. In Disneys ""Million Dollar Arm"" a modest but heartening surprise he steps up into a comfortable leading role that of a canny sports agent who brings baseball to India and then brings a couple of promising teenage athletes to the strange and wondrous land of Southern California (filmed in Georgia where director Craig Gillespie shot ""Million Dollar Arm"" when he wasnt on location in India).The real-life entrepreneurial hustler J.B. Bernstein played by Hamm is no saint in this movie version. Hes up against it; his hotshot lifestyle lacks the high-profile clients he needs to pay the bills squire the models and wax the sports car. Hes out for No. 1 and often treats those around him like No. 2. In the crafty humane hands of screenwriter Tom McCarthy who wrote and directed ""The Visitor"" and ""Win Win"" Bernstein has a few things to learn. This is the way these inspirational sports movies go of course but this is why ""Million Dollar Arm"" is worth seeing. Its wince-worthy moments when people arent treating other people the way they should be treated feel honest and emerge naturally from the true-ish story.Bernstein was one of the brainstormers behind a reality TV contest known as ""The Million Dollar Arm."" The winner and runner-up in the first round of the contest Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel both new to baseball. They werent even much into cricket. But they could throw. Leaving their homes and families for the first time the young men traveled to Los Angeles and began training for a major league tryout.The film combines factual characters with fictional ones and keeps the sentimental uplift to a refreshingly tactful minimum. Arriving in Mumbai for the big promotion and contest which turns out to be an ad hoc scramble Bernsteins the belligerent fish out of water. Back in the U.S. Rinku and Dinesh are the ones wondering where theyve been plopped down with a map. Theyre more or less hung out to dry by an increasingly distracted and irritable Bernstein even though hes their sponsor and cultural ambassador. Obstacles are surmounted lessons are learned and the actors are shrewd enough to make it all work even when the last 20 minutes meander.As Bernsteins tenant and eventual lover Lake Bell is terrific funny truthful. Shes improved every movie she has ever been in and she has a way of interacting with everyone on screen that feels natural. Bill Paxton Mr. Relaxation has a few scenes as pitching coach Tom House. Alan Arkin makes tiny little comic mountains out of tinier comic molehills as a crusty nap-prone scout. With winning panache Aasif Mandvi plays Bernsteins partner in business whose densely packed family life is the opposite of Bernsteins fastidiously self-centered single-guy existence. Theyre not exactly benched by Bernsteins story but one of the weaknesses of ""Million Dollar Arm"" is its occasional sidelining of the baseball hopefuls themselves. Suraj Sharma from ""Life of Pi"" portrays Rinku; Madhur Mittal plays Dinesh. There are times in director Gillespies film when you wish the movie really was about them primarily and Bernstein secondarily; once they start playing goo-goo-eyed matchmakers for their pal J.B. its more than a little patronizing. McCarthy is following well-established story grooves here but scene to scene he allows the dialogue to breathe and reveal bits of character along with the more expedient bits of plot advancement. Like Disneys ""Invincible"" starring Mark Wahlberg ""Million Dollar Arm"" has a way with corn but it doesnt feel like one of ""those"" Disney movies. Even with some vocal distress following his recent surgery Hamm shoulders the movie with ease.mjphillipstribune.com""Million Dollar Arm"" - 3 starsMPAA rating PG (for mild language and some suggestive content)Running time 204Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Foreign Exchange Market Reviews Mark Wahlberg Madhur Mittal Win Win (movie) PG Rated Movies Latest movie reviews Review Godzilla  1/2 Review Chef  1/2 Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising73deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-million-dollar-arm-20140515,0,2633079.column",200,milliondollararm21,milliondollararm,chicagotribune

CAST Jon Hamm Lake Bell Suraj Sharma Madhur Mittal LENGTH 204 In ""Million Dollar Arm"" two teenagers in India enter a reality television show created by a wealthy sports agent. The contest is baseball a game theyve never played but the prize is a whopper a chance to join a major league team in America. ""Million Dollar Arm"" is based on a true story but guess whose? Not that of Dinesh Patel (Madhur Mittal of ""Slumdog Millionaire"") or Rinku Singh (Suraj Sharma ""Life of Pi"") who give up everything they know for a new life in a strange country but that of the sports agent J.B. Bernstein. Played by Jon Hamm retailoring his Don Draper role from ""Mad Men"" Bernstein is a likable if objectionable figure the rich Westerner who learns valuable lessons from poor natives. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Rudyard Kipling couldnt have written a more heartwarming blithely colonialist fairy tale than ""Million Dollar Arm."" Directed by Craig Gillespie from a feel-good script by Tom McCarthy (""The Visitor"") the movie is simultaneously offensive and endearing. It gapes at India like a friendly tourist carts home its two souvenirs and then in its awkward way tries to find common ground between East and West. Dinesh and Rinku may have hoped to find independence in America but instead theyve landed in a Disney family film -- and theyre the children. Fascinated by elevators and romping through fancy hotels like a couple of Curious Georges theyre referred to as ""kids"" or treated as such by everyone in the movie. Meanwhile Bernstein plays the neglectful dad leaving his charges to struggle through school (Bill Paxton plays pitching coach Tom House) while hes off courting the blinged-out football star Popo Vanuatu (Rey Maualuga of the Cincinnati Bengals). ""They just need to see that you care"" says Bernsteins casual girlfriend Brenda. Shes played with sharp intelligence by Lake Bell but even Brenda seems destined to become a mommy figure. Filling in this glowing picture are Aasif Mandvi as Bernsteins colleague Indian actor Pitobash as an eager-beaver translator and Alan Arkin not exactly stretching as a crusty scout. 231 BaseballTrailer MIllion Dollar Arm Its all a bit cringe-inducing but what can you do?

Share Tweet Million Dollar Arm is the kind of sports movie that crams everything subject-specific into quick-cut montages to make room for maudlin drama and fish-out-of-water comedy--a baseball flick where no one is actually shown playing baseball. It offers plenty of sideline pleasures--like seeing Jon Hamm do his disaffected Don Draper stare while watching Susan Boyles performance on Britains Got Talent--and a gaping hole in its center. Into this hole it tosses redemption arcs romantic comedy cutesiness business rivalry subplots--anything as long as it isnt directly related to sports.Hamms character J.B. Bernstein is a real person and the plot of Million Dollar Arm--which is based on Bernsteins involvement with a reality TV competition in India to find pitchers and turn them into MLB prospects--is more or less true. As the movie opens JB and his partner Ash (Aasif Mandvi) are struggling to nab new talent. When they score a meeting with billionaire investor William Chang (Tzi Ma) who wants to market American sports in untapped Asian markets J.B. comes up with the idea of scouting cricket bowlers in India for the major leagues. (As is often the case truth is kookier than dramatization; it was Chang who came up with the idea because he wanted to prove his hypothesis that great baseball players were like X-Men mutants with a certain percentage born into every population.)The episodic first act which follows J.B. around India intersperses travelogue-like widescreen vistas with the kind of advertising and business humor familiar from countless 50s comedies. But after J.B. finds his prospects--Rinku (Suraj Sharma) and Dinesh (Madhur Mittal) neither of them cricket bowlers--and returns to Los Angeles the movie immediately slips into the kind of unlikely-bond-helps-grump-soften-up scenario that is screenwriter Tom McCarthys stock-in-trade.McCarthy best known for writing and directing The Station Agent The Visitor and Win Win specializes in accidental-family stories with grouchy character-actor leads and quirky hooks; what keeps his work from descending into treacle is his generous handling of the cast a holdover from his own background as an actor. Unfortunately director Craig Gillespie (Lars And The Real Girl) doesnt place the same emphasis on performance. Despite a strong game cast (which also includes Lake Bell Alan Arkin and Bill Paxton the latter perfectly cast as pitcher-turned-pitching-guru Tom House) Gillespie never manages to overcome the flaws of McCarthys writing which tends to pile on characters and stock situations. The most hackneyed standbys of coming-to-America humor--the discovery of pizza confusion about relationships and religions--get trotted out and the selfish J.B. has to repeatedly redeem himself (to Ash Rinku Dinesh and Brenda the generic love interest played by Bell) through symbolic gestures. The lessons are broad familiar and largely un-compelling.

(If you dont know who either of those people were I suppose you lie outside this films target demographic.) She wants to know why J.B. Bernstein Hamms character is sitting there stony-eyed while the dying Gehrig tells the Yankee Stadium faithful that hes the luckiest man in the world. He tells her he cried the first 35 times he saw it.This moment has almost the opposite effect from the one director Craig Gillespie and writer Thomas McCarthy are presumably going for. Instead of connecting ""Million Dollar Arm"" to the sentimental mythological traditions of baseball lore it only emphasizes the vast unbridgeable gap between then and now. While professional sports may play an even larger role in American culture than they did in Gehrigs day they have been largely demystified and turned into realms of science business sociology and law of chronic traumatic encephalopathy and Wins Above Replacement and an NFL draftee smooching his boyfriend and ""Im taking my talents to South Beach."" The Hollywood sports movie has had trouble adjusting to this new reality and often seems mired in an unhappy-grandpa zone trying to recapture the lost magic of years gone by like Clint Eastwood talking to that chair. (The best baseball movies of recent decades I would argue are both indie films and fundamentally disenchanted ones like ""Sugar"" and ""Eight Men Out."")For some reason which may not be unconnected to the personal tastes and predilections of the men in late middle age who dominate film production the studios keep churning out middlebrow male-centric fare like ""Draft Day"" and ""Trouble With the Curve"" and ""Million Dollar Arm"" to little discernible result. Its not as if Hollywood executives fail to grasp that exceptions like ""Moneyball"" and ""The Blind Side"" were hits precisely because they didnt feel like ""sports movies"" because you didnt have to know or care about on-base-plus-slugging or Texas high school football to follow the story. ""Million Dollar Arm"" is almost too obviously trying to be that kind of movie a based-on-a-true-story blend of ""The Blind Side"" and ""Jerry Maguire"" with a side of chicken tikka masala and an exceptionally faint veneer of multiculturalism. But as that moment of Gary Cooper yearning tells us it also has its eye dolefully fixed on the glories of the past.""Pride of the Yankees"" is very likely a better movie than ""Million Dollar Arm"" but thats not the point. I havent watched the former film since I was 13 years old and dont plan to remedy that anytime soon. But good or bad the Cooper film spoke to its era capturing the innocent adolescent narcissism with which prewar white America viewed itself and its national pastime. ""Million Dollar Arm"" is a dithering uncertain film from an era of dithering uncertainty when baseball has become a thriving global enterprise but long ago lost its aura of specialness in American life. Its protagonist is a smarmy grown-up manchild protagonist lost in a highly uninnocent grade of narcissism whom even the charismatic Hamm cant render especially likable. As he begins the process of trying to shake his career free of Don Draper Hamm faces multiple dilemmas principal among them the fact that he oozes nostalgia from every pore and it contaminates his surroundings. Whether hes to become George Clooney or David Caruso very much hangs in the balance; I would suggest for the time being avoiding any character who wears a suit. You Might Also Like In ""Pride of the Yankees"" the most beloved male movie star of his era played one of the greatest players in baseball history who is presented as an iconic hero a man of action not of words who is not immune to tragedy but entirely free of introspection. In ""Million Dollar Arm"" the star of ""Mad Men"" plays an embittered 40ish agent who lives alone in a Beverly Hills ranch house. His once-thriving firm is sliding toward bankruptcy -- he cant even successfully seduce a mid-grade NFL linebacker without putting a million bucks up front -- and his Porsche-driving model-dating lifestyle is in grave jeopardy. Bernsteins stroke of genius -- his idea to troll India for cricket bowlers who can be converted into viable baseball pitchers -- is primarily successful as an entrepreneurial scheme. (In the real world none of Bernsteins supposed Indian discoveries have gotten anywhere near the big leagues a fact the movie evades. But the American Idol-style competition he devised remains a hit.)Bernsteins brainstorm also becomes the mechanism for saving his soul and hooking him up with the Right Girl but those things are essentially by-products of the fact that hes offered Major League Baseball an entry point into an untapped market of 1.2 billion people. J.B.s trip to India in the company of a senile baseball scout played by Alan Arkin is massively uncomfortable and gets more so the longer it goes on. We get bits of family back-story for both Rinku (Suraj Sharma) and Dinesh (Madhur Mittal) the young men who win J.B.s big talent-hunt competition. (Neither of them was a cricketer interestingly.) But this isnt their movie. The emotional narrative of ""Million Dollar Arm"" is entirely about Rinku and Dineshs redemptive effect on J.B. and not at all about the strangeness of their journeys from remote Hindi-speaking villages to Southern California let alone the bizarre neocolonial spectacle that brought them there and left the rest of India behind. It wasnt J.B. Bernsteins job to end poverty and cure inequality but presenting his encounter with those things as the keys to his own personal healing borders on the offensive. In fact the main thing Rinku and Dinesh bring into J.B.s life once a mishap involving a hotel elevator renders them his permanent houseguests is family values. Im not kidding about that; ""Million Dollar Arm"" is not just a Disney film but a Disney film that could have been made with minor elisions and different character names in 1963. Never mind whether these two guys are ever going to be viable baseball pitchers (Which theyre not.) Their real function in life is to travel halfway around the world and introduce spirituality romance and home cooking into the life of a jaded Jewish guy in L.A. who has overdosed on trendy restaurants 14 glasses of Chardonnay and 22-year-old girlfriends. With their help he will notice at last that the medical student next door (Bells character) is just as skinny as a model even if she wears less makeup. If he cant quite live up to the lost mythology of American manhood to the avatar of Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig at least he can show her the movie and pretend not to be bored while she cries.

Leave it to Disney to show us that dreams really do come true. In this case the American Dream. (Ron Phillips) B- Million Dollar Arm Genre Sports Biography Drama; Starring Alan Arkin Lake Bell Jon Hamm Madhur Mittal Suraj Sharma; Director Craig Gillespie; Release Date Wide 05/16/2014; Runtime (in minutes) 124; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Walt Disney Pictures Posted June 3 2014 -- 1200 AM EDT If starring in schmaltz were a crime Jon Hamm would be serving five-to-10 in a federal supermax facility for Million Dollar Arm. Its the latest male weepie cast from the same Disney mold as The Rookie and Miracle and its essentially Jerry Maguire Goes to Mumbai. Inspired by real events it tells the story of an arrogant sports agent named JB Bernstein (Hamm) who fails to land the superstar client who would save his struggling company so he hatches a desperate crazy scheme He heads to India to find a pair of cricket players (Life of Pis Suraj Sharma and Slumdog Millionaires Madhur Mittal) whom he can turn into the next Major League pitching aces. Sure the stranger-than-fiction tale has some spark but director Craig Gillespie manages to swing for every cliche and the two Indian stars are reduced to exotic fish-out-of-water cartoons as soon as they arrive in America. Lake Bell and Alan Arkin are likable but one-note as respectively the quirky love interest who makes JB want to be a better man and the cranky old scout who slowly reveals his own soft chewy center. Fortunately Hamm has practice every Sunday night playing a smirking jerk in need of redemption and he gives the film what little spiky bite it has. Id be lying if I said the movie didnt get me a few times. But thats the thing about schmaltz Just because you can see it coming doesnt mean you can resist it.

He comes up with a strategy to get talented Asian cricket players to play Major League Baseball. Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 1152 a.m. MST May 14 2014Jon Hamm plays a sports agent who hits upon the idea of turning Indian cricket players into baseball pitchers and making it a reality show. Predictable and cliched its also well-meaning.Jon Hamm in a scene from the film Million Dollar Arm. Credit Disney.(Photo Handout Disney)Story HighlightsThe trip to India to find players features some of the films best moments.The story loses some steam when everyone returns to the U.S.The film is riddled with predictable cliches but it also shows some heart (and theres Hamm).""Million Dollar Arm"" wears its heart on its sleeve which is fitting given the title.Its ostensibly a movie about a reality show that hopes to turns cricket players from India into baseball pitchers (and its based on a true story). But in reality it is a movie about a selfish man discovering through mistake after mistake what is truly important in life and since that man is played by Jon Hamm it attracts attention.Craig Gillespie directs a script by Thomas McCarthy and neither is usually this sappy. Gillespies credits include the wonderfully weird ""Lars and the Real Girl"" while McCarthy has written and directed such films as ""The Station Agent"" and ""Win Win.""INTERVIEW Jon Hamm on Mad Men Million Dollar ArmTheyre on more-traditional ground here with a movie that has feel-good written all over it. (Its a Disney film so thats not a shock.) Its all very pleasant very inspiring just not very surprising.Hamm plays J.B. Bernstein a successful sports agent who sets out on his own and finds the going difficult. After his one big-name client leaves him for another agency hes desperate.One night his partner Ash (Aasif Mandvi) comes over for beers. Ash is a cricket fan. J.B. thinks the game is absurd but while switching back and forth between the game and Susan Boyles ""Britains Got Talent"" audition J.B. hits upon an idea India is hugely populated with millions of cricket players. Two of them must be good enough to land a major-league baseball tryout with the proper training.So theyll hold a contest to find two such players -- and make it a reality show.So J.B. heads to India where we find some of the films most-intriguing moments. (Gillespie explores the exotic beauty but not in a show-off kind of way. More in a genuine you-are-there manner.)With the help of Amit (Pitobash) a baseball nut and Ray (Alan Arkin) a cranky aging scout they get the contest off the ground and find a couple of winners Rinku (Suraj Sharma) and Dinesh (Madhur Mittal).The film loses some steam when they head back to the U.S. The boys are trained by Tom House (Bill Paxton) the baseball coach at the University of Southern California. But thanks to the reality-show aspect of the contest House has to greatly accelerate the learning curve for the boys who find the game difficult (well duh).Meanwhile J.B. works to regain his lost client and begins spending some time with Brenda (Lake Bell) the med student who rents the bungalow behind his house but whom he has dismissed because shes not a supermodel.So yeah hes a little shallow.But hes also Jon Hamm A major star So you can guess where all this will lead not just for J.B. but for everyone.Fine fine. Only a cynic wouldnt root for Rinku and Dinesh. Though it isnt overly cynical to suggest that the movie might have been better served had it focused less strongly on J.B.s redemption and spread more of the plot wealth around to Rinku and Dineshs story.But ""Million Dollar Arm"" obviously means well. Its probably a cliche to describe a sports movie winning but in this context that means it fits right in.Review Million Dollar Arm  3 starsDirector Craig Gillespie.Cast Jon Hamm Aasif Mandvi Alan Arkin.Rating PG for mild language and suggestive content.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Bernstein (Jon Hamm) used to be the Big Man on the Block yet when we first meet him in Craig Gillespies paint-by-numbers baseball movie he can barely make ends meet. Then a fleeting moment of channel-surfing inspiration involving a cricket match and--no joke--Susan Boyles viral performance of ""I Dreamed a Dream"" gives him a career-resuscitating scheme Go East middle-aged man and run a talent competition to discover the first major-league pitchers from India. Million Dollar Arm aims to be our national pastimes Slumdog Millionaire a First World-meets-Third World melodrama with sports as the grand uniter. Every emotional beat is calculated which the film pretty much cops to when the characters--including imported fastball slingers Rinku (Suraj Sharma) and Dinesh (Madhur Mittal)--watch the Gary Cooper staple The Pride of the Yankees and remark on its tear-jerking effectiveness. What keeps you watching is the charisma of the performers Hamm does an amiable riff on his Don Draper persona (hes cynical before the big melt) Lake Bell is a delight as his tart-tongued love interest and Sharma and Mittal are all charm as the cultures-uniting underdogs.

Bernstein alongside Lake Bell as girl-next-door love interest Brenda in a scene from ""Million Dollar Arm.""       Photo Ron Phillips/Disney MOVIE REVIEW Million Dollar Arm Barely ""Maguire."" Running time 124 minutes. Rated PG (profanity suggestive content. Paid previews Saturday night at the Kips Bay the E-Walk others. Opens May 16. Striving to to be an Air India  ""Jerry Maguire"" by sending  a morally compromised sports agent to India in search of clients and redemption ""Million Dollar Arm"" gets buried under a thick layer of bland sweet Disney custard. Despite the pulsing South Asian score that gives the film some energy its not even a slumdog hundredaire. At the outset Jon Hamm does everything but sing ""Free Fallin "" as his sports agency flails. He hits on the desperate move of venturing into uncharted territory for pro baseball India. The sport is unknown there but cricket bowlers he reasons are kind of like baseball pitchers and anyway out of a billion people someone must be able to throw a baseball. Plus finding an Indian player would mean opening up the majors to a huge untapped market. ""Million Dollar Arm"" is a true story about two Indian pitchers who did indeed get discovered by J.B. Bernstein (Hamm) and signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates organization. You can tell some producer heard about the story and said ""Its just like a movie"" Yes a really dull and predictable one. It works only as the most undemanding kind of wholesome family entertainment. Madhur Mittal left as Dinesh and Suraj Sharma as Rinku.Photo Ron Phillips/Disney You can see every turn from the opening J.B. is kind of a jerk the girl next door (Lake Bell) is pretty and smart. India strikes him as smelly. This being a Disney effort though J.B. not only doesnt hit bottom he doesnt even hit the middle. Its hard to feel sorry for a guy who drives a Porsche and looks like Jon Hamm. The hint of decadence consists of this We hear him say he dates only models. Scandal. The film misses its opportunity to be meaningful in favor of a slow and factory-made Disney attempt.Photo Ron Phillips/Disney Writer Tom McCarthy has made some fine films such as ""Win-Win"" and ""The Visitor"" but this script is as deep as home plate and director Craig Gillespie (""Lars and the Real Girl"") matches him in betraying his indie background just as Hamm comes across as a gelded version of his sinister ""Mad Men"" character. In a laborious series of tryout scenes in India J.B. gradually becomes friends with the girl next door via Skype. (Why are they chatting so much if they didnt like each other when he left LA?) Alan Arkin brings a little wryness as a crotchety old scout but J.B.s and the films observations about India are shallow and trite. (Things stink Indians honk too much.) Its like hes a Victorian colonialist bemused by all these strange little foreigners. This makes him mildly unpleasant company but he should have been a full-on wiseguy who cracks wise about everything he sees. A hilariously derisive cynic who finally realizes what matters makes for a better arc than mild rudeness turning into mild niceness. When the two Indian winners of J.B.s ""American Idol""-style contest called ""the million dollar arm"" return to California the movie stumbles along with a series of woeful fish-out-of-water jokes. The boys (Suraj Sharma Madhur Mittal) and J.B.s Indian assistant (Pitobash) are likable enough but they dont even get distinct personalities. Instead theyre interchangeably childlike fellows who push all the wrong buttons on elevators and puke in J.B.s Porsche (which in the tortured logic of the script somehow costs him a major business deal the same one he already lost at the start of the movie). Jon Hamm as fallen sports agent J.B. Bernstein.Photo Ron Phillips/Disney ""Million Dollar Arm"" is certainly infused with the spirit of todays baseball It makes you check your watch a lot. Though Bell gives a charmingly laid-back performance the inevitable romantic scenes dont have much spark. The moral -- that pro baseball is about learning to have fun -- is nonsense and even the big finish is a letdown You expect to see the two boys pitching against each other in the World Series. In fact six years after they signed minor-league deals neither has even made it to the pros. (They signed for eight thousand bucks.) Fatally mild slow and factory-made ""Million Dollar Arm belongs somewhere less competitive than the multiplex. Like the ABC Family Channel -- the entertainment industry minor leagues.

All Rights Reserved. Looking for a chance to shout ""Only in America""? Only in America -- or an American movie -- could the story of the first two Indian players to be signed to a Major League Baseball team get spun as an L.A. sports agents journey toward realizing the importance of family and not only dating models. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - In Million Dollar Arms second half when it collapses like the 78 Red Sox Jon Hamms JB Bernstein has plucked two promising athletes from their villages on the subcontinent and then borderline imprisoned them in his austere California manse. Just months before these young men had never held a baseball. They need to be told on their first day of training why fielders wear gloves. Neither speaks English both are achingly homesick and theyre drilling each day with college-level American players for an upcoming MLB tryout. But the movie sidelines all of this real-life drama to put Hamm through the paces of a plot so old its grandkids are AARP-age by now The Businessman Who Stops Putting Business First But Is Rewarded in the End with a Great Success in Business Anyway.Heres how off the scripts emphasis is. Like all studio pictures just before the big finish there are several scenes of despair; our heroes have come so close to their goal but now it looks like they cant possibly make it until one of the characters does something great like give a speech or drive to the airport really fast. (This is only a spoiler if you have never seen the last 20 minutes of a movie.) In this case the Indian prospects -- Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel played by Suraj Sharma and Madhur Mittal -- feel defeated as it turns out going from newbie to pro in 10 months is really hard. But dont worry about them Screenwriter Tom McCarthy rings in the climax with a speech so preposterous even Jon Hamm cant sell it. Its gist JBs sorry that he forgot that baseball is supposed to be fun which of course stirs up just the belly-fire these boys need. Imagine the opposite Youve been spirited from America to Bombay drilled for months at cricket and when things got tough your big buck-up lecture is about what this baffling games supposed to mean to kids.Film Details Million Dollar Arm RatingPG GenreDrama Running Time124 More Info Trailer Meanwhile the prospects have devoted their time to cooking up a potluck and stringing Christmas lights in the backyard in order to set up a movie-magic date night for JB and his med-student tenant played by Lake Bell. If you didnt know Million Dollar Arm came from Disney that might tip you off -- these guys may as well be Cinderellas dress-sewing mice. Also before that for comedy they puke in his Porsche.That said much of Million Dollar Arm is pretty good for a movie committed to the wrong characters story. (Its like if The Pride of the Yankees were about a pushy guy Lou Gehrig crashed with once.) The much stronger first half covers JBs tour of India with his Million Dollar Arm pitching contest which is part dream-making reality show and part harvesting scheme. He sees this cricket-obsessed nation as an unexploited resource Surely some of its bowlers and hitters have MLB-level ""juice."" This plays as a bustling travelogue a splendidly shot comedy that tickles at a self-involved Americans frustrations at the differences between here and there. JB faces mad Mumbai traffic bribe-oiled local bureaucracy and mild intestinal distress but he also quickly takes to the place and its people both of which are presented with respect and wonder. Outside the contest montages director Craig Gillespie lets scenes unfold lets shots communicate more than just one thing lets our eyes make discoveries Is that a goat on a scooter? Is that the Taj Mahal behind the pitchers mound? Has Hamm really pit-sweated through his shirts or is that just ace wardrobe design? (Hamm our best-looking grumpy dad-type proves sturdily appealing in a prickly role.)Occasionally the film leaves JBs quest to check in with the players. They have a few tender moments with family none of whom suffer much stereotyping but we only get to see their most earnest declarative moments -- the movie endorses their values but has no time for specifics. Instead it cuts to JBs Skype flirtation with Lake Bells character who is at first dismissed by JB for not being model enough for him. Aasif Mandvi (assured and funny as JBs business partner) actually has to plead that shes ""cute"" which is the films biggest laugh. Shes Lake Bell And unencumbered by her unspeakable beauty she laces her go-nowhere role with winning offhand comedy. Hamms Indian adventures demonstrate that there are still rich stories to be told about (reasonably) normal people transplanted to lands they consider strange. If the filmmakers had been more daring with perspectives and narrative structure and afforded their Indian characters the screentime and agency JB enjoys on his adventure Million Dollar Arm might have distinguished itself. Instead it devolves into one of those family flicks whose only real drama comes from outside itself. For the last hour rather than worry that these guys might not make it I found myself wondering how deep in the filmmakers could get before their story fully departed this world for the land of sports-movie magic. This one makes it to about the seventh inning.1 Lake Bell(c) 2013 - Disney Enterprises Inc.

Its based on a sidenote in modern baseball history about a particularly far-flung search a hungry sports agent made for new prospects -- and how he found two in India. That they had never even picked up a baseball before? Well that was a minor issue. What was major was that they had some natural talent and that he had a lot of chutzpah. Its a predictably nice little story but thats the biggest part of its problem. It never strays from predictability and its niceness can feel forced. What might harmlessly fill 100 minutes gets stretched out over two hours and padded with some questionable material. Jon Hamm -- who rarely loses his cocky grin and never his perfectly groomed stubble even in rural India -- is J.B. the arrogant sports agent. (How arrogant? He doesnt think neighbor Lake Bell is pretty enough to date.) His confidence though is mostly a shield these days as his sports agency is nearly bankrupt. Thats when he comes up with his wild passage-to-India idea -- which he happily confesses is mostly a merchandising gimmick (imagine selling baseball caps to a billion new fans) And as this movie is about J.B. well we know he is going to be humbled a bit in the second act and humanized by the third as he finally realizes theres more to life and baseball than money. (Also that -- duh -- Lake Bell is kind of cute.) The problem is hes really not that interesting a character (the script by the better-than-this Tom McCarthy never makes J.B. bad enough for his later conversion to be particularly dramatic). Nor is his world view really one that many people will want to share. Seen through his eyes India is an either/or dump of foul-smelling slums and dirt-poor villages where the citizenry is smilingly servile (and clownishly incompetent) or loud and angry (and greedily corrupt). All the food makes you sick and absolutely nothing works. This perhaps makes the Indians preferable to J.B.s chief investor the mysterious Mr. Chang who is cold inscrutable and very very rich. But it doesnt exactly make any of them well-rounded characters and although the film casts Aasif Mandvi as J.B.s partner and pal it cant hide its own condescension. Nonetheless the actors try hard. Suraj Sharma (from ""Life of Pi"") is boyishly charming as one of the players and Madhur Mittal is intriguingly unknowable as the other. In fact it would have been wonderful to see the story told more from their point of view (like the very different ""Sugar"" a downbeat film about a Dominican prospect.) That of course is not the sort of film Disney is engineering here -- a simple inspirational sports movie which is not only family-friendly but in keeping with J.B.s dreams export-ready. Although theres a suggestion of off-screen sex prudish Indian censors will find little to object to here -- outside of the cultural stereotypes. But ""Million Dollar Arm"" never focuses on anything but its calculated marketing and formulaic plot or bothers to take a look -- a real look -- at the interesting world around it. The wisest person here -- an old coach played by Bill Paxton -- insists that the key to baseball is to relax and have fun. Its the key to making entertainments like this too. Ratings note The film contains some alcohol abuse. Million Dollar Arm (PG) Disney (124 min.) Directed by Craig Gillespie. With Jon Hamm Aasif Mandvi. Sneak previews Saturday night; opens May 16.

TWITTER In this true-life inspirational comedy Jon Hamm plays a sports agent who hopes to find the next great MLB pitcher in India. Dutifully covering all the requisite inspirational sports movie/fish-out-of-water bases yet still managing to throw a few fresh curves into the mix Disneys Million Dollar Arm assuredly hits a home run. As homers go it may be of the inside-the-park variety -- after all the true story of sports agent JB Bernsteins career-rehabilitating scheme to turn an Indian cricket player into the next great MLB pitching ace cant help but feel like a Jerry Maguire/Slumdog Millionaire combo platter with a hefty side serving of The Blind Side -- but its mighty satisfying nonetheless. Credit a rock solid turn by lead Jon Hamm that doesnt shy away from revealing a darker underbelly to his underdog character as well as a keenly-observed script by Tom McCarthy and deft direction by Craig Gillespie for the rewarding changeup. VIDEO Million Dollar Arm Trailer--Jon Hamm Scouts for Baseball Talent The result should have audiences cheering enthusiastically when Million Dollar Arm opens May 16 for what will likely be an extended home stretch. Back in 2007 Bernstein a driven agent who at one time represented Barry Bonds and Emmett Smith staged a contest in India with the intention of finding the baseball equivalent of Yao Ming from among the countrys legions of cricket bowlers with the winner receiving a 100000 prize and a shot at a major league contract. As portrayed by Hamm Bernstein is clearly feeling the pressure of a career that hasnt quite gone as planned since starting his own agency and that Million Dollar Arm reality TV competition is a last-ditch attempt to keep his business afloat. Recruiting an irascible retired baseball scout (Alan Arkin) with a penchant for napping and an overeager gofer/translator (engaging Bollywood actor Pitobash) Bernstein proceeds to comb the rural Indian communities with initially unpromising results. He eventually returns to Los Angeles with two contenders in tow -- Rinku Singh (Life of Pis Suraj Sharma) and Dinesh Patel (Slumdog Millionaires Madhur Mittal) a pair of 18-year-olds who know next to nothing about baseball and as it turns out not much more about cricket. Trusted with attempting to turn the culture-shocked teens into plausible players is USC pitching coach Tom House (Bill Paxton) who has less than a year to prepare the boys for the big leagues. THEATER REVIEW Sovereign Body Providing a sympathetic motherly ear for his house guests meanwhile is Bernsteins smart/sexy/funny next-door tenant Brenda winningly played by triple threat Lake Bell. In the hands of Lars and the Real Girl filmmaker Gillespie and The Station Agent and Win Win writer-director McCarthy it should come as no surprise that Million Dollar Arm is filled with richly-drawn characters and offbeat humor but it also doesnt avoid dealing with more uncomfortable issues -- specifically the exploitative nature of Bernsteins career gambit. Coming off of the final season of Mad Men Hamm makes a convincing case for big screen stardom here with a confident complex performance that makes you want to cheer him on despite those determinedly self-serving character flaws. Meanwhile Sharma and Mittal convey a genuine sense of alienation as the wide-eyed transplants for whom even elevators hold a sense of wonder wanting to make their benefactor and their homeland proud even as they become increasingly wracked with self-doubt. Rounding out those smartly-cast characters are The Dailys Shows Middle East correspondent Aasif Mandvi as Hamms pragmatic Indian-American business partner.

Still this ""based on a true story"" underdog tale is infectiously determined to make you fall in love with it like a mangy dog that plops its head in your lap and gazes adoringly at you until you scratch it behind the ears. Eventually you give in and scratch. And then you wash your hands. See video Jon Hamm Hunts for Indias Best Pitchers in Million Dollar Arm Trailer Jon Hamm stars as J.B. Bernstein a down-on-his-luck sports agent whos just lost a hot prospect to a rival agency. In need of a Hail Mary -- and inspired by late-night channel flipping between a cricket match and Susan Boyles ""Britains Got Talent"" audition heard round the world -- he and partner Ash (Aasif Mandvi) pitch an Asian investor on baseballs last great untapped market India. Theyll hold a nationwide talent search called Million Dollar Arm and find an Indian cricketer who can come to America and play baseball thus tapping into billions of potential T-shirt purchasers the way Yao Ming did in China. Even though it would make more sense to send Ash whos Indian-American he gets stuck at home with his wife and perpetually vomiting infant twins while J.B. heads off to South Asia in search of a pitcher. With the help of local baseball fanatic Amit (Bollywood comedy star Pitobash) and over-the-hill MLB scout Ray (Alan Arkin who seems determined to spend his twilight years giving the same performance over and over) J.B. sorts through thousands of players before he winds up with javelin tosser Rinku (Suraj Sharma ""Life of Pi"") and laborer Dinesh (Madhur Mittal); theyve both got strong arms and fast pitches but neither plays or even likes cricket a fact that J.B. doesnt learn until after theyve all touched down in L.A. After accidentally setting off a fire alarm in their hotel Amit Dinesh and Rinku have to move into J.B.s bachelor digs where they befriend his tenant Brenda (Lake Bell) a doctor-in-residency whos renting the bungalow behind J.B.s house. Dinesh and Rinku train with USC coach Tom House (Bill Paxton) known for his unusual methods but theyre far away from home and anxious about their futures. Also read Why Sports Movies Like Million Dollar Arm Draft Day Have Become Their Own Underdog Stories Will J.B. discover his paternal instinct and give his players the attention and nurturing they need to succeed? Will the scruffy rookies blow it on their first public tryout only to get a second chance to shine? Will skirt-chasing J.B. discover that Brenda has been his soulmate all along? Gosh what do you think? While ""Million Dollar Arm"" cries out for the light touch that John Lee Hancock brought to Disney sports biopic ""The Rookie"" -- Craig Gillespie of ""Lars and the Real Girl"" and the ""Fright Night"" remake directs here -- its excessive sentimentality will eventually wear down even some of its more hard-bitten viewers. Hamm knows exactly how to play a business type with a gruff exterior that hides a mushy center and hes got terrific chemistry with Bell who could also play this smart and sexy sassmouth in her sleep. See video Jon Hamm Mocks Dating Show Appearance Would You Have Picked Me? Sharma and Mittal dont even speak English until well into the film but their wide-eyed innocence plays effectively as does Pitobashs combination of enthusiasm and bewilderment. Its no ""Win Win"" the previous sports movie from screenwriter Thomas McCarthy but ""Million Dollar Arm"" offers up the sort of uncynical delights of Disneys live-action movies from the 1960s; all thats missing is the Flubber. If you like your baseball served up with a hot bucket of buttered corn ""Million Dollar Arm"" could satisfy you. Just beware of the tummy ache from all that goop. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

""Jerry Maguire Goes to India"" or ""Slumdog Fireballer"" must have been the high-concept pitch for baseball drama ""Million Dollar Arm"" but the highly enjoyable result isnt nearly as opportunistic as it sounds -- even if it is in part a portrait of a shameless opportunist. Drawn from the real-life efforts of sports agent JB Bernstein to turn Indian cricket bowlers into Major League Baseball pitchers this sharp slickly produced addition to the Disney sports movie canon works as both a stirring underdog tale and as a revealing look at the expanding global footprint of the American sports-entertainment machine. Deftly counterprogrammed against pre-summer tentpoles ""Godzilla"" and ""X-Men"" the pic stands to hit somewhere in the 60 million ballpark of the studios previous ""Miracle"" and ""Invincible."" Those two movies also repped the handiwork of ""Million Dollar Arm"" producers Mark Ciardi and Gordon Gray who by now know their way around this sort of movie as surely as Jerry Bruckheimer does a guns-blazing action spectacular. But much credit is also due here to director Craig Gillespie (""Lars and the Real Girl"") and screenwriter Tom McCarthy (""The Visitor"") who put across the movies many cliches with a certain verve and find room for unexpected detours and grace notes in an overall familiar trajectory. Its not just any movie after all that can make you feel warmly toward a vain fast-talking sports agent whos started to believe his own help-me-help-you hustle. But ""Million Dollar Arm"" largely pulls off the trick perhaps because said agent is played by Jon Hamm who possesses a special talent for ferreting out the humanity in seemingly soulless corporate suits. Even then theres surely a fair amount of dramatic license at work in the movies depiction of Bernstein as a former high-flyer at a big-time agency (where his clients included Barry Sanders and Emmett Smith) turned scrappy independent struggling alongside his partner (Aasif Mandvi) to hold together their fledgling operation. Its not just the ballplayers who are meant to be the underdogs in ""Million Dollar Arm"" but their representatives too which might have been a bit much to take had the filmmakers not wisely opted to leave Bernstein with a few character flaws the size of Wrigley Field. The importing of foreign-born sports stars to play for U.S. teams (aka ""sports capitalism"") has become big business in the era of the NBAs Chinese-born superstar Yao Ming and MLBs Japanese-born Ichiro Suzuki and Masahiro Tanaka. But like a prospector whos showed up late to the gold rush the Bernstein we first meet in ""Million Dollar Arm"" bemoans the lack of any remaining fertile ground for such discoveries -- Europe has been thoroughly canvassed East Asia has run dry. His eureka moment comes while flipping channels between a televised cricket match and singer Susan Boyles now-famous audition for ""Britains Got Talent."" In the mashup an idea is born and with the backing of a Chinese-American entrepreneur (Tzi Ma) Bernstein sets off to India to launch a reality TV competition designed to unearth the best baseball players on the subcontinent. This proves easier said than done as Bernstein traipses from Jaipur to Calcutta to Bangalore in the company of an enthusiastic volunteer assistant/translator (popular Bollywood comic Pitobash) and a narcoleptic retired baseball scout (a delightfully craggy Alan Arkin) whose finely tuned ears tell him all he needs to know -- that none of these cricket-bowling lads can throw a baseball anywhere near major-league speed and accuracy. Until of course a couple of promising prospects do emerge in the form of 18-year-olds Rinku Singh (""Life of Pi"" star Suraj Sharma) and Dinesh Patel (Madhur Mittal who played the wayward older brother in ""Slumdog Millionaire""). If the plotting is undeniably predictable the India scenes nevertheless give ""Million Dollar Arm"" a hearty dose of visual and narrative energy. As far as the films saturated color palette is concerned as well as its jubilant wall-to-wall song score by Oscar-winning composer A.R. Rahman Gillespie certainly takes his cues from ""Slumdog"" director Danny Boyle (who was himself filtering Bollywood through an Anglo prism). The country itself is depicted in largely the same chaotic exoticized terms that have become de rigueur in Western-made movies endless snarls of traffic stomach-upsetting cuisine poor sanitary conditions and those unflappable locals who throw their hands in the air and say things like ""Here in India we do things a little differently."" But even at its broadest the movie is careful to afford its Indian characters a certain fundamental dignity -- and in another intelligent move allows them to deliver much of their dialogue in their native Hindi. Singh and Patels ultimate fates wont come as much of a surprise to anyone who follows baseball -- or whos seen a baseball movie before -- but ""Million Dollar Arm"" is arguably more about the journey than the final destination and it takes us on one that is surprisingly smart about the business of sports and the business of being human. When Bernstein returns to L.A. with his two prize catches in tow the movie plays down the obvious fish-out-of-water humor in favor of a genuine sense of the loneliness and disorientation these rural boys feel upon arriving in a big American city. At the same time Bernstein finds his own pronounced desire for a Disneyfied happy ending pitted against the tougher realities of inventing two overnight sensations from whole cloth. So glimmers of selflessness begin to stir in the agents self-absorbed soul without quite sending the movie into that foul territory of mawkish sentimentality. Sometimes a hard-hitting expose sometimes a big-hearted crowdpleaser ""Million Dollar Arm"" wants it both ways to be sure but its instincts are mostly right on the money as are its actors. Sharma in particular has matured both physically and emotionally since his striking debut leaving no doubt about his natural movie-star charisma. One of the great utility players in American movies Bill Paxton shines as ex-Atlanta Brave turned USC pitching coach Tom House (the Mr. Miyagi of the piece). And Lake Bell has a nice flinty no-nonsense edge as the med student who might just be the cure for Bernsteins serial womanizing ways. Hungarian-born d.p.

In any case its up to you to deprive yourself if you so choose T.D. You will be the one missing out. The movie will survive your boycott trust me. Yes I see what youre saying about some reviews.
