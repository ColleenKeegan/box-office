Context and psychological insight are the major casualties of ""Day Night Day Night"" a dramatically limited but strangely powerful portrait of a young would-be terrorist who sets out to blow herself up in Times Square. By turns frustrating and impressive in its austerity Julia Loktevs experimental first feature is too radically minimalist to find much of an audience beyond the festival circuit although those willing to stick with it may find it an authentically harrowing if not especially revealing experience. A wiry young girl with sharp mousy features (Luisa Williams) holes up in a motel room where she eats bathes sleeps and receives occasional instructions from a trio of black-masked men. Pic proceeds at a slow uninflected rhythm that gives every ritual and interaction equal weight while stubbornly withholding any information -- i.e. the girls ethnic background or religious beliefs -- that might give viewers any insight into her decision to turn kamikaze. Livelier second half marks the girls arrival in New York as d.p. Benoit Debies handheld camera follows her restlessly down streets and into restaurants with explosives stashed in her back-pack. Filmed in broad daylight on the teeming streets of Manhattan these scenes deliberately confuse the issue of whether Williams is interacting with strategically positioned actors or unwitting extras. Delivering a very tricky performance within the tightest of parameters Williams ultimately succeeds in drawing viewers into identification with her plight that is genuinely disquieting. When her characters plan doesnt go quite as expected thesp gradually strips off the layers of cold calculation to expose a panicky recognizably human individual underneath. ""Day Night Day Night"" could serve as a working definition of a film that provides more questions than answers and some may justifiably question the value of a film that tackles the most urgent of contempo issues without the balm of insight or analysis. Dingy underlit cinematography is as grim and withholding as the film itself. Sound design is almost too crisp.

"Film follows a suicide bomber and every detail has meaning - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Events    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Film follows a suicide bomber and every detail has meaning Luisa Williams plays an unnamed American woman who plans to blow herself up in Times Square. (benoit debie/ifc first take) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  May 18 2007 ""Day Night Day Night "" an astonishing movie from Julia Loktev  begins in a state of heightened ambiguity. The camera trails behind a young American woman (Luisa Williams ) who is picked up by a stranger at a bus station somewhere. They ride in silence and have a meal in silence too. Shes deposited at a hotel where she has a bath eats a spring roll and dozes off. Later a group of masked men in knit hats and jumpsuits arrives to handcuff and blindfold her.Through it all she manages a gracious bearing. In fact her manner is delicate. The sweet softness in her voice creates a nice contrast with the deep sugarless intonations of the men who sit with her bring her clothes and pizza and put a rifle in her hands before recording her with a video camera. When she asks for a Kleenex to dab her nose (its too shiny) theres still time to think ""Day Night Day Night "" is a paramilitary comedy.Indeed waiting for the action to crystallize into meaning is like anticipating the development of a Polaroid  which is to say that in so many ways ""Day Night Day Night "" is old-fashioned. Those hotel scenes last for more than half an hour and as they unfold you realize with intense gratitude that Loktev is a shower not a teller. Only gradually does her movie confirm our worry that this woman (we never do get her name) plans to blow herself up in New York City which in the films second half she heads into Times Square to do.The most obvious question -- why? -- ultimately becomes the films least important one. The bomber has a face of many ethnic and racial possibilities which alters the movies politics Her organizations agenda is non denominational in a way that makes her determination to carry it out all the more chilling.Loktev  a 37-year-old Russian-born Brooklynite (her other feature is ""Moment of Impact "" a moving 1998 documentary about her incapacitated father) told Salon.com recently that she was partially inspired to make the film after hearing about a Chechen woman who stopped for bananas before detonating her bomb. Her movie she said is ""about the bananas not the bomb."" To that end Loktev has her bomber snacking on everything from those spring rolls to a candy apple. As the film changes course and darkens the initial whimsy of her eating becomes a kind of neurotic comfort.This is Williamss first movie as an actor (she used to work at New York magazine ) and she has an unforgettable face the way women in certain European art movies do. Theres nothing conventional about it Her dark tired-seeming eyes recede into their sockets her mouth and nose are almost beak-like drawn into a sort of permanent frown. She evokes Sandra Bernhard but you dont fear Williams the way Bernhard wants to be feared. And in the films agonizing last 20 minutes her severe and opaque countenance opens into a universe of transparent emotional distress.Even the hotel scenes with her falling asleep waking up eating trying on clothes could have been perfunctory stuff. But Williams emits a sort of radiance that tells you shes not going for a cipher even though there are crucial things about this character we dont understand such as how she got herself mixed up in any of this. Even that question becomes beside the point once its clear that shes unwaveringly committed to her assignment. That devotion of course gives the second part of the film its suspense and when her faith is challenged the film takes a powerful existential turn.It would be easier to dismiss ""Day Night"" as a cheap stunt if it were out to capitalize on public fears and the current political climate. But Loktev asks another question When youve been living for one cause is it possible to begin living for something else?Stirring sympathy for a terrorist makes ""Day Night"" in some ways a shocking film. But rather than overtly exploiting politics Loktev evokes the works of the great French director Robert Bresson. Like Bresson her subject ultimately is religion -- how it can inspire devout action but in certain crucial moments cant be explained at all. She captures the absolute power in that awe.In its painstaking attention to visual detail the movie also recalls the films of the Danish director Carl Dreyer  especially ""The Passion of Joan of Arc."" But Loktev meets these two masters halfway  then proceeds in the opposite direction one thats unimaginably bleak. She makes a transcendental moment -- a miracle probably -- seem horrific and terrible but in the holiest of ways. Hell on earth never seemed lonelier than it does here.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/ movies/blog.

Comments (1) 30 Days of Night Produced by Sam Raimi this atmospheric chiller is based on a horror comic by Steve Niles but feels derivative of 28 Days Later. Barrow a tiny Alaskan outpost hunkering down for a month without sunlight is besieged by frenzied vampires led by a butch Danny Huston and assisted by Renfield-like psycho Ben Foster who destroys every means of escape from the town. Forget about a stake through the heart sheriff Josh Hartnett discovers that decapitation is the best way to stop the bloodsuckers who suggest feral steroid-crazed gymnasts as they scale buildings and leap onto moving vehicles. Curiously most of them have vaguely Mongolian features which implies that unspeakable evil lies just beyond the Bering Strait. David Slade (Hard Candy) directed. R 113 min.

"30 Days of Night | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; 30-days-of-night ) 30 Days of Night (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Its a pleasant change of pace to get a vampire movie where the bloodsuckers are allowed to be monsters. You know what Im talking about - no more of this brooding tortured soul shit. The undead here are hardcore killers ripping apart their victims throats then walking around with the blood caked all over their faces. Even Dracula wasnt this cold-blooded. Too often of late motion pictures have defanged their vampires turning them into whiney pseudo-romantic figures. Thats not a mistake made by director David Slade. Finally - a modern vampire movie where audiences sympathize with the victims rather than their attackers. If you think these creature are sexy you need therapy. The setting is Barrow Alaska - the northernmost outpost of the United States - on the eve of the annual month without sunlight. Barrow doesnt have a large population during the summer but when the sun goes down for the long cold night only the hardiest souls - about 150 of them - stick around. By the end of 30 Days of Night most of them will wish they had followed the birds and flown south. Vampires have come to Barrow this winter with the dual goal of feeding and eliminating witnesses. Their initial attack is swift and brutal. Within a day most of the towns citizens have become fodder. A small group of survivors led by the sheriff Eben (Josh Hartnett) and his estranged wife Stelle (Melissa George) fight to survive moving from place-to-place while occasionally dispatching a vampire if it gets too close. In Halloween Dr. Loomis uttered the refrain that ""death has come to your little town."" Thats an appropriate phrase for Barrow in 30 Days of Night. The premise - providing vampires with a month of sun-free opportunity to wreck havoc - is clever and if its not fully realized at least enough is done with it for 30 Days of Night to represent two hours of solid gory entertainment. This isnt one of those neutered PG-13 horror movies. Theres enough blood and viscera coating the screen to earn the R-rating without things tipping the scales into the ""torture porn"" category. In many ways what Slade has wrought here is reminiscent of an amped-up version of a Hammer vampire movie. In fact Danny Huston alternates between channeling Christopher Lee and Max Schreck. Most vampire movies have their own ""rules"" and that applies here where there are variations on a theme. Theres no religious iconography and while a wooden stake driven through the heart might make an impression its never tried. The way to eliminate a vampire is to sever the spinal cord or destroy the brain. Hence the most effective weapon is an axe. Bullets only work if fired directly into the head. Humans killed by vampires will transform if given the chance. However the undead are jealous of their status and prefer to decapitate their victims before the transformation can occur rather than growing the ranks. Sunlight is fatal but holy water probably isnt. 30 Days of Night also doesnt provide a clue whether garlic does anything more substantive than causing bad breath. The movie which is based on comic book is set up more as an action thriller than a straightforward horror movie. Slade whose previous feature Hard Candy touched on a horror of a different sort establishes the framework largely as that of an extended chase. There are some ""boo"" moments but those are largely beside the point. 30 Days of Night is more interested in getting the adrenaline flowing than in scaring viewers although Hustons grim goth lord is pretty freaky. (This is arguably the most convincing portrayal Huston has ever given.) Viewers have come to expect a lot visually from comic book adaptations and 30 Days of Night delivers. Theres nothing here as radical or groundbreaking as can be found in the likes of Sin City or 300 but Slade crafts a number of scenes that stand out. Perhaps the most indelible of these is an overhead shot of Barrow as the vampires hunt down and dispatch humans. The final scene is also effective in the way it marries beauty and horror. One aspect of 30 Days of Night thats refreshing is that it doesnt require the survivors to have undergone frontal lobotomies in order to move the story forward. Yes characters occasionally do stupid things but theyre not unreasonably stupid and they dont force members of the audience to fight against the suspension of disbelief gag reflex. Im not going to claim that the screenplay is either airtight or brilliant but it is smarter than the average genre entry and thats a big plus. Theres even a moral question to be toyed with In order to defeat foes with no souls is it necessary to lose ones own soul in the process? This is the issue that Hartetts Eben has to debate. With Halloween just around the corner this is a seasonal way to spend two hours. 30 Days of Night works on its own terms which is more than can be said of most horror films these days.

"A Long Night Full of Fright washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On A Long Night Full of Fright Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints Friday October 19 2007 "" 30 Days of Night"" is the kind of gruesome but entertaining survival guide you pray you never have to follow how to stop vampires killing you during the darkest days of Alaskan winter. Hey it could happen. It certainly does in Barrow Alaska where vampires come to terrorize the isolated town as seasonal darkness descends for a loooong month. From a safe distance -- in our own pocket of darkness as it were -- its a visceral kick to watch as a group of ever-dwindling survivors led by young resolute Sheriff Eben (Josh Hartnett) figures out how to outlast these powerful predators. Until sunlight returns and reduces the nasty suckers to black confetti its time to lie low and plan occasional guerrilla attacks. To survive these guys -- are you taking notes? -- are going to need a good sharp ax to sever the invaders heads. (Forget about guns and bullets; theyll only annoy the vamps.) And as Eben discovers its vital to get a good clean cut or youll be Alaskan sushi in seconds. Directed by David Slade (""Hard Candy"") the action scenes are artful and terrifying; these killers move so quickly and decisively there seems to be no hope for humanity. And while Hartnett and Melissa George (as his estranged wife) make functionally appealing characters the real star of ""30 Days"" is Danny Huston. As the animalistic leader of the pack hes as disturbing as he is compelling a feral creature with all senses at full capacity. If theres an action figure Im ordering one. -- Desson Thomson 30 Days of Night R 108 minutes Contains scenes of terror and major gore.

30 Days of Night When hell freezes over | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMovies30 Days of Night When hell freezes overBased on the graphic novel of the same name 30 Days of Night delivers a graphic horror tale that aims to inject new blood into the vampire genre.By Bruce DeMaraEntertainment ReporterFri. Oct. 19 2007 (out of 4)Directed by David Slade. Starring Josh Hartnett Melissa George and Danny Huston. 113 minutes. At major theatres. 18A Based on the graphic novel of the same name 30 Days of Night delivers a graphic horror tale that aims to inject new blood into the vampire genre.Article Continued BelowSet in Barrow Alaska - the northernmost town in the U.S. - the land of the midnight sun is also the land of solid darkness for 30 days a year prompting a motley crew of enterprising vampires to show up for an extended UV-free feeding frenzy.Its an interesting premise and the opening moments show great promise as a parka-clad Renfield-esque vampires helper is set ashore from a ship and immediately sets about killing all the local sled dogs destroying cellphones and generally cutting off any hope of escape or communication with the outside world.But while the names of author Steve Niles and illustrator Ben Templesmith show up in the credits its clear the film script has gone through the standard Hollywood death-of-a-thousand-rewrites wringer to emerge as shadow of its former self drained of much of its creative synergy.There is the occasional bit of fun. As the last plane out departs a sheriffs deputy readjusts the population numbers on the town sign downward Its about to experience a far more propitious drop.The vampires are also compellingly creepy portrayed as Russian mobster-like Goth types with pointed teeth and glossy black marbles for eyes eager to tuck into anything with a pulse.But the film quickly becomes saddled with some predictable and unwelcome baggage.When Stella Olemaun (played by a spunky Melissa George) the estranged wife of the sheriff misses the plane forcing her to stay behind with ex-husband Eben (played by earnestly doe-eyed Josh Hartnett) were forced to endure an unexplored undefined subplot regarding their failed relationship.The storytelling descends from interesting to jerky spotty inconsistent and unconvincing.The vampires can smell blood but cant seem to locate the few survivors huddled in the attic of an empty house. While they can stalk along rooftops like acrobatic alleycats some survivors escape them easily by simply running away and hiding.If the head vampire played by Danny Huston is so concerned about humans discovering the existence of vampires how does he figure burning down the town is going to wipe out all traces of the bloody massacre? Who is the little vampire girl that nobody in the small town seems to recognize? Who is the other little girl who though blood-smeared seems to have survived a month in the frigid Arctic?While there are some genuinely tension-filled scary moments its the uneven storyand sloppy stupid inconsistencies and loose ends that rob the film of its power to truly frighten.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Starring Josh Hartnett Melissa George Mark Boone Junior and Danny Huston. Directed by David Slade. (R. 113 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The vampires in ""30 Days of Night"" dont waste time with romance like the ones in ""Interview With a Vampire"" go to techno-music rave parties like the ones in ""Blade"" or hang around near the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk like the ones in ""The Lost Boys."" Theyre an efficient killing force laying waste to an isolated town in Alaska as theyve done in other outposts for centuries. But they dont count on the resourcefulness of some of the sturdier residents of our 49th state who know how to survive a brutal winter - even one filled with bloodsucking fiends. ""30 Days of Night"" is the well-paced and entertaining horror debut of ""Hard Candy"" director David Slade who captures the coolest parts of Steve Niles comic book series on the big screen. The movie is filled with action and drama and buckets of gore and yet it has a certain intelligence that fans of ""28 Days Later"" and John Carpenters better movies will appreciate. While some horror enthusiasts will be turned off by all the talking and character development theres certainly enough killing going on as well - and thankfully even some heavy construction equipment gets involved. The film stars Josh Hartnett and those five words may be enough to keep you home watching old George Romero movies instead of this film. But try to find some forgiveness in your heart - with a few swings of an ax Hartnett makes up for ""The Black Dahlia"" ""Hollywood Homicide"" and ""The Guardian."" (Technically Ashton Kutcher starred in that last film but can anyone tell the difference anymore?) Sure Hartnett still owes us big for ""Pearl Harbor"" but at least hes trying to pay his debt to society. Its best to stay vague with even the setup for this movie because it takes so many turns - looking as if its going to be one kind of horror film before unexpected events force the characters in other directions. All you need to know is that some vampires have arrived in the town of Barrow Alaska which the movie says is the northernmost city in the United States which goes without sun for a month each year. Most of the townspeople leave during this time and theres no means of escape to the outside world. After a mercilessly quick siege the sheriff (Hartnett) his tough ex-wife (Melissa George) and a band of resourceful neighbors fight back Viet Cong-style. ""We have two advantages"" the sheriff says. ""We know the town and we know the cold."" Technically they have three advantages. While Danny Huston is appropriately creepy and menacing as the vampire leader the standout performance once again comes from Mark Boone Junior who plays a fearless town outcast who does the best construction equipment beat-down since Sigourney Weaver climbed in that ""Aliens"" forklift robot thing. Ben Foster is also at his feral best as a crazy drifter whose connection to the bad guys is uncertain. For a movie that is almost entirely devoid of sunlight a refreshing amount of action takes place in full view of the audience - without any of that shaky camera blood-on-the-lens nonsense that lesser directors use to mask their inability to shoot action scenes. There are close-ups wider shots and even a sort of Google Earth view of the carnage. Screenwriters Niles Stuart Beattie and Brian Nelson take the subject matter seriously thinking about how both sides of the fight might react in each scenario. As the movie heads into ""Dawn of the Dead"" survival horror territory the characters dont make stupid decisions and the plot turns dont rely on unrealistic coincidences. Those of you who dont read comic books will find some of the turns - especially an over-the-top twist at the end - a bit too much for a mindless night out at the movies. But at least the filmmakers arent trying to insult your intelligence. -- Advisory This movie contains adult language and gory violence. The vampires method of feeding - like that kid in the no-hands-allowed pie-eating contest from ""Stand By Me"" - is particularly gruesome. Apparently table manners arent a priority when you havent dined in 100 years.

Close your eyes and youll be scared out of your wits just by the ambient noise.Slades most intelligent move was to cast character actor virtuoso Danny Huston as the vampire leader Marlow who speechifies about his hatred of God and his utter contempt for humanity.In one particularly harrowing scene Marlow and his followers toy with a little girl pushing her back and forth between each other the way a cat bats around a half-dead mouse. They laugh with as much pure glee as sadistic menace.As if by reflex the girl invokes God the way we all do. (""Please God No"")With an almost gentle but ironic half-smile Marlow tells the girl ""No God."" Not missing a beat he tears out her throat.Like The Exorcist and Alien 30 Days evokes a direct visceral experience of evil in its purest form as the all-devouring empty movement of life without purpose or order.30 Days of Night  (out of four stars) Directed by David Slade.

The cast of the show would like to drive a stake through his heart for trying to save money by recording the show without them. The recording - which was being made on the sly until Melissa Errico one of the stars of ""Dracula"" heard about it from a friend - may also cause headaches for the shows producer Dodger Stage Holdings. Yesterday Actors Equity said it is investigating the matter to see if the recording violates the actors contract which states that a producer cannot make a ""sound recording"" of a show without using the original cast until 19 weeks after the production has closed. The critically clobbered ""Dracula"" closes Jan. 2. Cast recordings are notoriously expensive to make. For every eight hours they spend in a recording studio actors are entitled to a weeks salary. All told the cost of recording a Broadway show can run between 250000 and 500000. The producer of a show usually controls the recording rights licensing them to a record company which pays the recording costs. But because ""Dracula"" was so poorly received no record company picked it up. So Wildhorn decided to record it himself. And in an effort to keep costs down hes using performers who are not in the show and therefore do not have to be paid Equity wages. ""I dont have the kind of money it takes to use anyone from the show"" Wildhorn told The Post. What Equity wants to know is just who exactly controls the recording rights to ""Dracula."" If the Dodgers do then the recording violates their contract with Equity and they could be forced by the union to pay the actors whatever fees the actors would have received had they made a cast recording. The Dodgers may have waived their rights to allow Wildhorn to make the album on his own. But that wont satisfy the union. ""We have told the producers that we will hold them responsible if they waived any rights with Frank Wildhorn that impact the actors"" Alan Eisenberg the head of the union said. The Dodgers said ""We have absolutely nothing to do with any recording Frank Wildhorn is doing."" The matter will likely end up in arbitration a production source said. Wildhorn says he owns his songs and can record them in any way he sees fit. A ""Dracula"" album he contends is a valuable marketing tool that can be used to generate productions of the show around the world. ""I have to make this copyright valuable to myself and my kids"" he said. ""I can make records of my own stuff with my own money."" A recording industry executive speaking on condition of anonymity said Wildhorn is probably correct. ""Theyre his songs; he can do anything he wants to with them"" the executive said. ""As long as he doesnt call the record a cast album Equity cant stop him."" Still the executive said that recording the show without using the original actors ""was a pretty sh - - - y thing to do."" A least some of the actors feel that way too. They were stunned to learn one day after they were told ""Dracula"" was closing that they wouldnt get to record the show. Errico first heard about it from her friend the Broadway actor Raul Esparza who was asked by Wildhorn to record the role of Dracula (played by Tom Hewitt in the show) a theater source said. Esparza not wanting to take work away from actors in the show declined. A ""Dracula"" source says the cast feels ""hugely depressed by this"" and ""betrayed"" by Wildhorn. It doesnt sit well with the director of the show Des McAnuff either. Last week he went backstage and told the actors that he was sorry about the recording and that he had nothing to do with it. Wildhorn sent the actors an e-mail outlining his reasons for making the album without them. He told The Post ""I cant blame them for feeling the way they do. But as everyone in the show knows I spent months trying to find a record company to make a cast album. But unfortunately in this particular case I wasnt able to pull it off.""

Elizabeth Weitzman Friday October 19 2007 400 AM 30 Days of Night. Thriller about an isolated Alaskan town faced with an invasion of vampires. With Josh Hartnett Melissa George. Director David Slade (153). R Graphic violence and gore language. At area theaters. How do you know youre watching a true B-movie? If youre laughing and no one on screen is telling a joke. An anemic adaptation of Steve Niles and Ben Templesmiths creepy comic series ""30 Days of Night"" is lighter on horror than it is on inadvertent humor. Of course were not supposed to find anything funny about the predicament facing Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) sheriff of Barrow Alaska. The northernmost town in the United States Barrow goes days without seeing sun. This is so obviously the ideal place for a vampire its a wonder that head vamp Marlow (Danny Huston) never brought his gang of bloodsuckers here before. But hes clearly ready to make up for lost time since the movie barely has a chance to establish itself before Marlows wild-eyed protege (Ben Foster) drops in to warn of imminent destruction. After the first attacks Eben and his estranged wife Stella (Melissa George) gather the few surviving townsfolk and head for shelter where they chart their next move. That alas turns out to be the same move they repeat for the rest of the film They hide for a while rush a few vampires and race back to cover - assuming they survive such a plainly ill-fated plan. Then again if they didnt keep making the same ridiculous mistakes wed have no movie since director David Slade relies more on editing tricks than on plot to build suspense. (Those simply in it for the gore will have no complaints.) Aside from an appropriately stoic Hartnett the characters are so anonymous we barely notice whos gone and whos still around. As for the villains - whose attributes go little further than a thirst for blood an aversion to light and some truly unfortunate dental work - their high-pitched screams move from creepy to annoying in a matter of minutes. Which is a considerable problem since the film is far too long at nearly two hours. Slade may not be able to build a lasting sense of dread but we know just how his victims feel as the endless darkness stretches on. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

While the sun is away the vampires prey in 30 Days of Night. Photo Columbia 30 Days of Night 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Every other scene or so some unbelievable icky-sticky gross-out occurs in 30 Days of Night. Perhaps it is a decapitation by ax. Perchance it is the sight and sound of a precious girl munching on a corpse. It might feasibly be a little bit of both. But even as stage blood flows like water this wicked-mean vampire thriller pushes ahead with effective characters a fantastic visual schema and a terrifying plot. The whole thing scared the bejesus out of me whatever a bejesus is; all I know is I havent got one any longer. For that I blame the evil noggin of David Slade the director behind 2005s psycho-twisted stalker flick Hard Candy. Its much less graphically violent but both films leave a filmy residue of horror thats hard to wash off. It might never and frankly it shouldnt; a truly scary movie should do some permanent damage to the psyche. Nothing in 30 Days of Night looks all that groundbreaking. It calls on the usual blood-sucking stand-bys (neck bites gnashing teeth) and the usual narrative progression of a contemporary slasher film We enter a contained space with assorted characters who die hideously one by one until they dwindle to a handful. In this case the contained space is Barrow Alaska where the sun sets and stays there for 30 days of night. In this fictional town (which bears little resemblance to the real-life Barrow) roads are cut off for the duration. What an irresistible opportunity for a shipload of itinerant vampires who sneak in after sundown and prepare to snack for a month undisturbed by daylight. They send a runner ahead of them a half-bit weirdo (310 to Yumas Ben Foster current and undisputed king of the strange) who cuts the towns power and torches everyones cell phones in a pyre. There to investigate is Sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) standing on a ridge of snow as he bids farewell to one last dusk. He gets word of more odd doings -- vandalism slain dogs in a kennel. That weirdo from out of town shows up at a diner demanding a bowl of raw meat a hamburger of doom. Then an old mans head pops up on a stake and from that moment on were in for a feast of nauseous gothic carnage. Ah but its such lovely nauseous gothic carnage. Two things make it so Its genesis in Steve Niles and Ben Templesmiths ashen horror comics; and its cosmetic kinship with F.W. Murnaus expressionistic Nosferatu. Slades vampires all have the pale aspect and curling fingernails of Max Schreck in his signature role -- giving a classic look to the washed-out computerized palette of this contemporary nocturne. Like 300 and other graphic-novel adaptations 30 Days of Night boasts a stylized claustrophobia that yields some arresting visuals The best in my book is an aerial portrait of townsfolk fleeing the undead through snowbound streets stained with blood. All of this is competently acted -- by Hartnett as Eben Melissa George as his estranged wife and Mark Rendall as his younger brother Jake. The film gets small details just so from the squeak of boots in the bitter cold to the grungy facial hair that sprouts over 30 days of hiding. These arent complicated people this isnt a complicated film but it messed with my head in a major way. As Georges character says of Fosters ""Hes just trying to freak us out."" Jake replies ""Its working.""

"The Alaskan ghoul rush - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Events    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies Movie Review The Alaskan ghoul rush Melissa George and Josh Hartnett try to survive an onslaught of vampires in ""30 Days of Night."" (kirsty GRIFFIN/SONY PICTURES VIA ASSOCIATED PRESS) By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  October 19 2007 If youre a vampire I suppose finding the right vacation spot can be a pain in the neck. So many variables to consider an absence of sunlight hot and cold running blood beach access. For the undead in ""30 Days of Night"" the town of Barrow Alaska has everything but the latter. Two out of three aint bad.Based on a 2001 graphic novel ""30 Days"" is a proficient atmospheric fangfest that does nothing you havent seen before but still does it passably well. Itll freak out teenage first-timers sneaking in under the R rating even if wizened gorehounds who know their vampire-movie history will stick with 1987s ""Near Dark"" still the final word in postmodern Nosferatus.The concept is as elegantly simple as the films desaturated color scheme. Barrow the northernmost town in the United States is plunged into darkness one month each winter when the sun dips below the horizon and doesnt come back. The road and the airport are closed; the reduced population hunkers down and waits. For a coven of vampires Barrow presents an all-you-can-eat buffet.For the locals led by Sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett looking more than ever like a fetal Tommy Lee Jones) its wholesale slaughter followed by 3 1/2 weeks of hide and seek. ""30 Days"" builds slowly and eerily to an early pitch of cover-your-eyes carnage as Eben drives around on the last day of sunlight discovering evidence that something is planning entrapment. The sled dogs have been killed; cellphones have been collected and burned. (How? Dont ask.) A wild-eyed drifter (Ben Foster reprising his ""310 to Yuma"" crazy act as the movies Renfield) arrives in town muttering dire warnings.Then night falls and the undead emerge freakish and dark-eyed dressed in fashionable black with rows of dessicated dental work. They speak in shrieky vampirese and their features dont quite make sense as if drawn by a comics artist who hadnt finished the correspondence course. And theyre fast. They pull you under a house and chomp through your carotid before youve even been properly introduced.So far so ghoulishly good and the leader of the vampires looks so remarkably like Danny Huston that you realize with a start it is Danny Huston slumming with playful B-movie nihilism. As the movie settles down and the dark days roll on ""30 Days"" becomes a fairly dull 10-little-Alaskans suspense film with Eben and the other survivors crawling from house to house trying to avoid detection.The groups awfully standard a raw kid an old coot a blowhard chicken a noble ethnic an anonymous girl and Stella (Melissa George) the lissome county fire marshal and Ebens estranged wife. Apparently the undead have their uses in the marriage-counseling department too.The director is David Slade whose previous movie the controversial low-budget drama ""Hard Candy"" was in many ways scarier than anything he gets up to here. But ""30 Days of Night"" is stylish in a doomy shallow graphic-novel way and despite regular dips into gore its better moments are quiet ones a lone woman calling for help on Main Street while dark figures move just out of sight on the surrounding rooftops. Theyve staked her out as bait. If youve never seen a vampire movie before feel free to bite.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/ movies/blog.

After recent pics ""Into the Wild"" and ""The Last Winter"" Alaska is once again the go-to place for premature death in ""30 Days of Night."" Horror opus derived from a graphic-novel series charts the mayhem that ensues when vampires invade an isolated far-North habitat during its annual month of sunlessness. Mainstream bow by David Slade director of attention-getting indie ""Hard Candy"" excels at bloodthirsty action though dialogue and human-interest aspects are a tad anemic. Result is a mixed bag but has a catchy premise and quite enough splatter to satisfy gorehounds which should make this a solid Halloween-season earner. Opening titles intro Barrow as the northernmost U.S. town subject to a months unbroken ""night"" at the height of each winter. Much of the modest population choose to avoid that gloomy stretch by going south for a spell. But even as the last of them depart leaving hardier loved ones behind Sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) discovers a string of disturbing crimes -- stolen cell phones found burnt to a crisp local sled dogs slaughtered in their kennels -- seemingly committed by someone intent on cutting the town off entirely from the outside world. A scraggly ill-tempered stranger (Ben Foster) appears out of nowhere. When thrown into jail the Renfield-like figure taunts Eben kid brother Jake (Mark Rendall) and others that there will be no escape when ""they come."" They already have A band of pasty ravenous irregularly prosthetic-featured bloodsuckers first pick off a few snackables on the outskirts before launching full-scale slaughter downtown. This reduces the cast to the usual ever-dwindling cluster of quarreling survivors a bit too soon. One might think vampires would want to pace themselves with so many meals on hand. Those citizens not yet drained and beheaded hide out in an attic for some days then are forced to keep moving. Sacrifices are made including a big one by the sheriff that leads to a somewhat underwhelming final confrontation with the vampire leader (Danny Huston). Pic is at its best whenever the bloods flowing as David Slades direction Art Jones editing and Jo Willems widescreen lensing create blunt visceral action that makes the vampires speed strength and thirstiness vivid. A notable early setpiece has a middle-aged couple abruptly dragged out of and under their home. Episodes involving a little girl in a general store and the fate of deputy Billy (Manu Bennett) will please those who like their gore graphic. Punchy as it is at such moments however the pulse slackens considerably between them. Dialogue is humorless and obvious (including the vampires subtitled guttural verbalizations). Attempt to create some emotional tension between Hartnetts Eben and Melissa George as his estranged-but-stranded wife Stella falls flat with neither thesp bringing much charisma to the table. Pic also does a so-so job staying credible on fantasy terms. The number of vampires seems to grow but its never clear why. Mostly the vamps are fast-moving and near-invincible; then again sometimes not. Despite occasional titles announcing ""Day 7"" etc. the passage of time is murky. Of course this is the sort of movie that requires suspension of disbelief but its numerous slow stretches allow such nitpicking questions to fester. Tech package is sharp down the line. Pics look is slightly desaturated with the color drained from the darkened world after some beautiful initial daylight vistas. Brian Reitzells score is unobtrusive -- a high compliment these days -- save one unfortunate late moment when Hartnett faces his foe to a ludicrous arena-rock drum roll even KISS would find corny. Though there really is a Barrow Alaska pic was entirely shot in New Zealand. Tons of Epsom salts shredded paper white blankets and other elements convincingly stand in for a snowy subzero environment. 30 Days of NightProductionA Sony Pictures Entertainment release of a Columbia Pictures presentation of a Ghost House Pictures production in association with Dark Horse Entertainment.
