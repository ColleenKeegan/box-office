A flabby tale of the unlikely friendship between a high school football coach and a mentally disabled young black man. The gentle mood and positive message may attract older and family viewers but only if theyre not over-saturated with excessive exposure to co-star Cuba Gooding Jr. ""Inspired by a true story"" it may be but inspired its not. A doggedly uneventful and flabby tale of the unlikely friendship between a South Carolina high school football coach and a mentally disabled young black man ""Radio"" wends its way to the inevitable heart-thumping ending with all the energy of a lazy summer day in the Deep South. The gentle mood and positive message may attract older and family viewers especially in Heartland areas but only if theyre not over-saturated with excessive exposure to busy co-star Cuba Gooding Jr. The producing team of Mike Tollin and Brian Robbins appears determined to dominate the sports movie zone even more thoroughly than vet writer-helmer Ron Shelton. But unlike Shelton who offers an acidic populist take on the sports world their pics (Tollins first feature ""Summer Catch"" as well as ""Radio"" his second) tend to go for the inoffensive by coddling viewers. Although the source material for ""Radio"" is a Sports Illustrated story by Gary Smith about James Robert ""Radio"" Kennedys rise to acceptance by the football squad and town of Anderson S.C. in the early 60s whatever hard edges existed in the original events are smoothed down to the point of dullness. Like his script for ""Finding Forrester"" writer Mike Rich crafts stunningly predictable events that bring together an older Anglo man and a younger black man. But Sean Connerys crotchety Forrester at least put up some early resistance to tete-a-tetes with Rob Browns would-be pupil. Ed Harris commanding Coach Jones -- looking like a lean Bear Bryant as he barks orders at his high school pigskin team -- takes an immediate interest in the youngster with the wide buck-toothed grin (Gooding at least a decade too old for the role). Coach Jones later nicknames the youth -- who glances curiously at the football practice as he pushes a shopping cart carrying his beloved transistor radio past -- Radio. The script mechanically establishes Jones as a man who has little time for his family during football season including daughter Mary Helen (Sarah Drew) and wife Linda (an underused Debra Winger). An early promise of conflict appears when Jones finds Radio tied up by players in an equipment shed and though it solidifies the coachs idea of making the lonely young man an unofficial assistant on the team even a naturally cathartic scene like the punishment of the guilty players (led by Riley Smiths smirking Johnny) is nothing more than a standard languid crane shot showing players in pads doing laps. Radio is quickly at Jones side on and off the field doing various odds and ends even in his classroom where Jones apparently doubles as a poli sci teacher -- an interesting side to the man that pic barely hints at. Even Radios home life is a picture of peace and love as hes cared for by his adoring hard-working widowed mother Maggie (S. Epatha Merkerson). Attempts to introduce conflict barely raise a ripple on the placid surface of ""Radio"" including school principal Daniels (Alfre Woodard) worries about Radios safety and the school districts liability; Johnnys attempts to get Radio in trouble; and Johnnys banker dad Franks (Chris Mulkey) hounding Jones about dumping Radio because hes ""distracting"" the team. Nonetheless Harris handles the role of Coach Jones with impressive professionalism invoking emotional credibility where almost none is to be had. Gooding by contrast is grating although he keeps a lid on his worst hammiest instincts until the mid-point when he starts pouring on the cutes. An extremely classy roster of supporting actors from Merkerson and Woodard to Winger are wasted in pointlessly limited roles. Tollin films both dialogue scenes and football action with unvarying flatness. In an otherwise visually undistinguished pic a sense of the period of the early 60s emerges in the design departments. James Horners music shamelessly yanks at the tear ducts especially at the end when the real-life Kennedy is seen running on the gridiron.

One might fear the worst of a film based on the true story of a mentally retarded man adopted as a mascot by a South Carolina football team - but a lot of talent has been thrown at this inspirational story and it proves a pretty decent offering of its kind. Here he is Robert Radio Kennedy pushing a junk-filled shopping trolley around a small town while listening to his transistor radio. No one talks to this distracted off-kilter individual until the local high school squad enliven their training by locking him in the equipment hut. Their appalled coach (Harris) punishes his boys and resolves to involve Radio in helping out the team. A distinguished cast provides oppositional gestures with Woodard the stern principal and Debra Winger as Harris concerned but resigned spouse. Theres not a drop of syrup in Harriss fair-minded thoroughly admirable performance and Gooding adds an unsettling volatility to his parade of love-me buck-toothed grins.

Cuba Gooding Jr. and Ed Harris star in Radio based on a true story. By Michael Tackett AP The movie about an unusual friendship between a South Carolina high school football coach (Ed Harris) and a mentally challenged man with a fascination for vintage radios (Cuba Gooding Jr.) is described as ""inspired by true events."" The real man known as Radio is shown in the movies closing credits. Based on this brief glimpse one surmises hes a lot less sappy than the character Gooding portrays. More about the movie Radio   Stars Cuba Gooding Jr. Ed Harris Alfre Woodard Debra Winger Director Mike Tollin Distributor Columbia Pictures Rating PG for mild language and thematic elements Opens today nationwide The story as written by Mike Rich and directed by Mike Tollin is hackneyed and formulaic. The fault lies mostly with Richs screenplay offering such predictable drivel as ""We werent teaching Radio. Radio was teaching us."" Harris delivers a bored bemused performance and Debra Winger has the barest of roles as his wife. Their daughter (Sarah Drew) whom the coach inexplicably ignores fares the worst. Her role is to stand around and beam at the bond being forged between her dad and the ebullient Radio. The dialogue is wince-inducing. After the coach kindly encourages Radio (born James Robert Kennedy) to help out at practice attend games and cheer from the sidelines a redneck local denizen (Chris Mulkey) drawls menacingly ""You got yourself a distraction needs dealing with."" As an explanation for why hes opposed to Radios presence this boob merely insists ""Its just better if we do things the way we used to."" The cinematography makes the small town look drab and even the most hotly contested football games come off dull and occasionally tedious. James Horners score insistently intensifies the slightest emotion with an excess of orchestration. Remember the Titans captured the pace and excitement of high school football far better. Radio himself is allowed only one personality trait cheerfully childlike. His mother (nicely played by S. Epatha Merkerson) describes her beloved son as ""the same as everybody else just a little slower than most."" It feels as if the filmmakers wanted so much to beatify Radio that they created only the barest of conflict and avoided problems that may have plagued the real guy. Though probably well-intentioned Radio comes off as manipulative of its audience and exploitative of the mentally challenged.

That his courage doesnt make them champions is one of the welcome touches in this small good-hearted but ultimately undramatic film. I went to the screening expecting ""I Am Sam"" meets ""Remember the Titans."" A Southern football team adopts a mentally challenged kid as their mascot and they go about their winning ways. Yay team. For a while I was right. Its autumn 1976 in Anderson S.C. After every game coach Harold Jones (Ed Harris) stops by the local barbershop for a tete-a-tete with the towns men who want to give advice or a backslap or just talk about the chances of the kids making it to state. On the outskirts of town (both literally and metaphorically) James Robert Kennedy (Gooding Jr.) a mentally challenged young man pushes his shopping cart full of junk. One day a wayward football winds up on his side of the fence and he takes it over the protests of the players. The next day the players tie him up in the equipment shed and pelt him with footballs -- until coach Jones discovers whats going on and the players are punished. Movie review 1/2 ""Radio"" with Cuba Gooding Jr. Ed Harris Alfre Woodard Debra Winger. Directed by Mike Tollin. Written by Mike Rich from an article by Gary Smith. 109 minutes. Rated PG for mild language and thematic elements. Several theaters. Radio -- as he becomes known because of his penchant for radios -- is invited back. Out of guilt? Were not sure but slowly Radio becomes part of the team half equipment manager half mascot. This worries the townsfolk. There may be a residue of racism in their worries but mostly they fear Radio will be a distraction to the team. And they may be right. The team begins to lose and in at least one instance Radio lets the opposition know the upcoming play but still he keeps his place on the sidelines. We expect a turnaround for the team but it doesnt come. Suddenly the season is over -- they wind up a mediocre 5-5 -- and instead of awkward goodbyes until next season Radio becomes further enmeshed in school life riding the bus acting as hall monitor and announcing lunches over the P.A. system. Forces begin to gather against him the buttoned-up school board and the local banker whos (yawn) father to the star athlete. Even the principal (Alfre Woodard) is more fence-sitter than backer. ""Why on earth are you doing this?"" she asks coach Jones. Its the question we ask ourselves. Is he using Radio to avoid his 17-year-old daughter? Or to make up for the son he never had? When we find out an explanation -- 90 minutes into the film -- its reasonable but undramatic; more of a ""huh"" than a ""wow."" ""Radio"" is based upon a 1996 ""Sports Illustrated"" article by Gary Smith and contains its share of cliches. It could have been more sharply written and compellingly directed; the cinematography should have been grittier; and the acting beyond Harris and Gooding Jr. is no great shakes. (Even the long-MIA Debra Winger as Jones wife doesnt register.) But the story goes in unexpected directions. We live in a winner-take-all culture and ""Radio"" suggests there are more important things in life.

(PG. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . In ""Radio"" Cuba Gooding Jr. falls victim to the ""Nell"" syndrome in which a vibrant loquacious actor decides that the road to an Oscar nomination is to wear a slack expression and a set of ""Nutty Professor"" teeth. Here he plays a mentally challenged young man who is invited by the high school football coach to help out with the team. As a result an outsider finds a place within the community. ""Radio"" is almost as bad as it gets. That it isnt is thanks to Ed Harris who brings depth and focus to his performance as the coach. For Coach Jones helping Radio (Gooding) isnt a casual thing but a profound commitment and very nearly an irrational compulsion. He even leaves his wife and daughter at home on Christmas Eve to spend the evening with Radio. To the extent that its a character study ""Radio"" is a study of the coach whos awakened out of a spiritual slumber by the sight of this young fellow stumbling around outside the school pushing a shopping cart. The picture is based on the true story of James ""Radio"" Kennedy who became an assistant to coach Harold Jones at Hanna High School in South Carolina. Inevitably the nice people like Radio and the nasty people want no part of him. Actually the worst that could be said about Radio as played by Gooding is that hes annoying. Loud enthusiastic and annoying. To play someone mentally challenged is to invite bouquets but Goodings performance stays on the surface. Only Sean Penn in ""I Am Sam"" ever really got it right -- the way to play mental affliction is not to demonstrate your understanding of it but to be it in all its humanity and sadness. Do that and youve done something noble. Fall short and you end up looking silly really silly. -- Mick LaSalle BEYOND BORDERS Romantic adventure. Starring Angelina Jolie Clive Owen and Teri Polo. Directed by Martin Campbell. Written by Caspian Tredwell-Owen. (R. 127 minutes. At the AMC 1000 AMC Kabuki Metreon and Century 20 Daly City.) . ""Beyond Borders"" is a film with its heart in the right place. Unfortunately its head is stuck so far in the clouds that it dissolves into preachy do- gooder mush. Academy Award winner Angelina Jolie plays Sarah who is jolted from her cushy life by the raging-bull tactics of rogue doctor Nick Callahan (Clive Owen ""The Bourne Identity"") who confronts Sarah and her privileged English crowd with the horrors of refugee camps in Ethiopia. After shedding a single silver tear Sarah resolves to go to the camp despite warnings of danger and death. And if you arent clear on the concept stick around. It happens again and again in a two-hour-plus slog as Sarah follows Owens character from Ethiopia to Cambodia to Chechnya. In every case the situation is the same Children are dying the rebels are cruel and ruthless and Dr. Callahan is furious. Certainly the message is worth hearing. Camps like these exist the horror is real and the filmmakers spare no expense to make us feel the pain of the desperate threatened refugees. (It should be noted that the harrowing scenes of horribly malnourished children are created with the help of computer graphics.) But Dr. Callahan and Sarah are such bullheaded know-it-alls that it is hard to sympathize. Time and again they ignore perfectly sensible advice in favor of following their own headstrong convictions. Told that the violent Khmer Rouge are on the way to the Cambodian camp and will certainly kill refugees Dr. Callahan insists on lingering to administer vaccinations. He is told that they cannot spare the time. He pitches a fit starts giving vaccinations and sure enough the Khmer Rouge show up and kill people. Thanks for the help doctor. Without question Jolie the actress is deeply committed to this cause. After her involvement in this project she was appointed goodwill ambassador for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and was presented with the Citizen of the World Award for raising awareness of U.N. issues. But surely they wouldnt want to encourage more aid workers like Sarah who rolls into every camp with the moral certainty that she knows whats best. Shes not much for listening to good advice either. When Dr. Callahan is captured by Chechen rebels she marches right up to their mountain camp with no plan other than to tell them to let Callahan go right this minute. There is of course a romance between Jolie and Owen but the attraction is a puzzle. Dr. Callahan is such a shrill crusader fulminating and swearing that it is hard to picture him sweeping anyone off her feet. Meanwhile Sarahs husband Henry (Linus Roache) is such a soggy English crumpet that we are apparently supposed to believe that he doesnt deserve someone who happens to look like Lara Croft. - War violence language and unsettling images of malnutrition disease and death. -- C.W. Nevius THE REVOLUTION WILL NOT BE TELEVISED Documentary. Directed by Kim Bartley and Donnacha OBriain. (Not rated. 74 minutes. At the Castro through Thursday.) . The gods of cinema verite were smiling on Irish documentarians Kim Bartley and Donnacha OBriain when they arrived in Venezuela early last year to make a sympathetic documentary about the nations president Hugo Chavez. The populist leader -- a friend of Castro self-proclaimed champion of Venezuelas poor and enemy of the nations oil oligarchy -- granted Bartley and OBriain full access. But it was the extraordinary events of April 2002 that put them in a place they never expected to be trapped inside the presidential palace during a coup. The filmmakers kept filming and the result is ""The Revolution Will Not Be Televised"" which is instructive not only for students of South American (and oil) politics but also for anyone who questions the importance of the media in determining who gets power and how long they keep it. The film adopts the view of Chavez and his supporters that Venezuelas privately owned TV stations are simply tools of the countrys elite and have persistently tried to undermine Chavez because of his share-the-wealth rhetoric. (And it has been largely just that -- talk. Since his election to the presidency in 1998 Chavez has introduced economic reforms but the country has been hurt by general strikes and the gap between rich and poor remains wide.) Chavez a former army paratrooper is enough of a pragmatist to play the same game using state-run TV and radio to defend his policies and flagellate his critics. This is business as usual in a highly polarized society -- whoever controls the flow of information (and whether any information flows at all) has the upper hand. Media blackouts invective and innuendo and out-and-out lies are just ""politics by other means."" Bartley and OBriain who make no pretence of objectivity offer one particularly galling example of media abuse by Chavezs opponents of course. The anti-Chavez commercial stations repeatedly broadcast footage of what appeared to be Chavez supporters during the chaotic hours of marches and countermarches early in the coup firing on Chavezs opposition. But the filmmakers contend that the Chavez backers were actually shooting defensively at snipers and support their argument with footage that was left out of the broadcasts. Its a pretty brazen example of what a little editing can accomplish. In the end the coup only kept Chavez out of power for 48 hours (which says something about the efficiency and ruthlessness of his opponents) but at least 11 people were killed in the upheaval on the streets. Political invective and media manipulation have real victims. What sticks with you about this film is the disturbing sense of unreality inside the presidential palace during the coup of how quickly things can spin out of control -- what is really happening out there? Whom do you believe? What do you do now? The sensation is dizzying and you may feel relieved -- certainly the filmmakers do -- when Chavez re-enters the picture. Theres a feeling of order restored but the depiction of political free fall has been unnerving. Its a scary lesson and not just for Venezuela. -- Walter Addiego . GASOLINE Drama. Directed by Monica Stambrini. In Italian with English subtitles. (Not rated. 85 minutes. At the Opera Plaza.) . Theres no doubt that ""Gasoline"" is an earnest effort by first-time feature director Monica Stambrini. The 31-year-old Italian known by film festival- goers for her militant lesbian short films is skilled at wielding a digital video camera and she clearly loves her characters. But the finer less militant arts of screenwriting and plotting remain a work in progress. The setup is this Lenni (Regina Orioli) who works for her lover Stella (Maya Sansa) at a gas station receives a visit from her disapproving mother (Mariella Valentini) whom she hasnt seen in two years. La madre intent upon breaking up the relationship hits her in frustration; Stella comes to Lennis aid throwing a right hook at the mother who hits her head on a counter and dies instantly. Clearly an accident and a case of self-defense. By promptly calling the police the two would be exonerated. Instead Stella believes shell be sent to jail so she spearheads a plan to dump the body and drive off -- thus ensuring the police will be on their tail -- so the two can stay together. OK fair enough. They arent thinking clearly. It can happen. But what occurs after that goes from bad to ludicrous -- at one point Stella intentionally leaves her dog at the dumping place because the dog has wandered off and they need to get away before someone comes along. Then several hours later she decides they need to go back and find the dog. Stambrini whose bio lists her birthplace as Mountain View (although she seems to have grown up in Italy) captures some pleasing images edited adventurously on a low budget. She also has cast her film very well. Orioli and Sansa are energetic and bring as much complexity to their roles as their underwritten parts will allow. Oriolis wordless stares as she hears her mothers voice talking to her from the dead are pitch-perfect. The problem may lie in the source material -- Stambrini adapted ""Gasoline"" from a novel by Elena Stancanelli. However Stambrinis dialogue seems especially dull and the screenplay lacks dramatic urgency. ""Gasoline"" seems to indict a society that does not readily accept homosexuality. Aside from Lennis mother theres a group of doped-up young people who pop up occasionally -- like when the screenplay requires it -- to terrorize the couple. But that message is undercut by the fact that they begin hassling Stella before they know she is a lesbian -- so theyre not necessarily anti- homosexuals theyre just idiots in general. -- G. Allen Johnson This film contains scenes of violence and sex.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

I couldnt figure out at first why the uplifting emotion peddled isnt honestly earned in this feel-good weepie which is inspired by the real story of a white South Carolina high school football coach in a small town and the black mentally challenged young man he took under his wing as a friend and team assistant in the 1970s. ""Radio"" is assembled from small hard stones of ignorance and intolerance paved over by large mushy examples of community goodness. It stars Cuba Gooding Jr. in a busy display of halting locomotion as James Robert ""Radio"" Kennedy nicknamed because of the many discarded radios he collects and Ed Harris clad in a Bear Bryant hat and durable humanitarian ideals as Coach Harold Jones. And whenever audience compassion fatigue threatens to set in as Coach smiles anew at Radios childlike enthusiasm director Mike Tollin (who has produced a handful of sports-builds-character movies) and screenwriter Mike Rich (who hit a solid triple with ""The Rookie"") wisely cut to infectious small-town football fever shaking cheerleader pom-poms on behalf of tolerance inclusion and the ice-breaking effects of Radios color-blind sunniness on the local mostly white citizenry. The PR slogan though tips the producers hand. ""His courage made them champions"" it declares summing up the congratulatory tone that overcooks the message Dignity hard enough to come by must be ratcheted up to courage decency amped to the quality of championship. Its a mercy that no one gets called a hero and its a dodge that racism never speaks its name. (Only the commanding African-American actress Alfre Woodard playing a high school principal with her reliable blaze is allowed to mention Radios race in the course of voicing her concerns about his unregistered presence on school grounds. Her story is the one we want to see.) In a small supporting role Debra Winger plays Linda Jones the loving wife who leaves dinner on the table for when her Coach comes home late from his labors. And when we first see her Linda is holding a copy of Betty Friedans ""The Feminine Mystique"" - her feminist reading pleasure. The book choice is one more small primping detail in a movie overloaded with noble signifiers. In the spirit of inclusiveness her courage too makes for champions.
