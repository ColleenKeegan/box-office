"Cosmic Slop Death by Enders Game << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Cosmic Slop Death by Enders Game Courtesy of Lionsgate Movies November 5 2013 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print There are so many reasons to go to the movies -- too many to list really. But no matter how long the list one item would never be ""watching stars recite exposition."" Enough people attended Enders Game last weekend to place it at the top of the box office. But could any of them have known how profoundly unspectacular an experience they were in for? Could they have anticipated how much standing around and explaining would be required of Harrison Ford and Viola Davis? Ben Kingsley does a lot of talking too but he at least gets to cover his face in Maori tattoos and treat an Australian accent the way some cats treat a carpet. The movie is set at an outer space training academy toward the close of the 21st century. Harrison Ford plays Colonel Graff. Davis is Major Anderson. Theyve got their eyes on a cadet whose strategic acumen could save mankind from a forecasted alien invasion. The boys name is Ender. Hes played by Asa Butterfield a lithe yet runty British teenager with dark marbles for eyes and the sort of faintly American accent you encounter in some call centers. His manner of speech is meant to disarm. All it does is disorient. Anyway Ford and Davis spend all their scenes evaluating Enders psychological fitness and ability to lead. To perform these evaluations they must stand or sit and stare into monitors showing footage of Ender with his fellow cadets. Ender is the cleverest in an elite class of teen mission specialists. (""Young people incorporate complex data better than adults"" says someone.) Training involves a lot of zero-gravity floating in a giant glass orb called the Battle Room. I havent read Orson Scott Cards severely adored 1985 science fiction novel the movie is based on so I took a friend who has read it enough for both of us. He assured me that Cards version of events differs from the ones depicted in the film insofar as Cards is exciting. Ender and his friends practice remote-control warfare and its interesting that the real-world moral havoc that drones wreak now has a grim showbiz corollary. The drones are deadly yes. But in the wrong hands theyre also powerfully dull. Here those hands belong to Gavin Hood who directed the film and adapted the novel and brings a certain dreariness to the proceedings. Nothing feels original. Wheres the world-building wonder? Wheres the psychology? The characters interact as much with devices as they do with actual people. Its like watching someone play a video game instead of watching the game itself. This movie gets at the appeal of Cards novels which flatters kids who feel smarter than everyone else. But Hood doesnt bring out the thrill of that sense of superiority. He buries it in plot points and lifeless academy sequences. My seatmate called the meet-and-greet among the cadets Top Toy Gun. The actual training sequences are Quarter Metal Jacket. Even the poor young energetic actors have few emotions to play just pages and pages of declarative sentences and cheesy clunk. For instance a girl named Petra (Hailee Steinfeld) flirts with Ender and heres how some of that goes She At least you dont have any bad habits. He I dont have any good ones. She Ill give you those. The banter in Star Wars was almost as bad but at least George Lucas created a great intergalactic cracker upon which to spread his cheesiness. Ford Davis Kingsley and the big barking Englishman Nonso Anozie are reduced to nothing other than monitoring chastising and encouraging. Once in a while the movie accidentally allows some actors to tell you why theyre here. At some point for instance Ford and Davis have an argument about the cadets and she says ""Its my job to put them back together again."" Which of course is always her job. For Ford this assignment must be even more surreal. Hes in outer space looking more or less for the next Han Solo. If he seems ill-tempered and at times corpselike its understandable. His acting life is flashing before his eyes.

By Richard Corliss Nov. 01 2013 Share Read Later Send to Kindle Richard Foreman / Summit Entertainment Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) believes that love and war are not opposites but fraternal twins. ""When I understand my enemy enough to defeat him"" he observes ""then I also love him."" That could be the motto of a New Age soldier listening to Enya as he slaughters a foe; but Ender is barely scraping puberty. Still hes man enough to butt wills against Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford) the glowering officer who has recruited the boy to lead a platoon of misfit kids against a hostile power. ""Im not the enemy"" Graff tells him before one big battle. And Ender replies ""Im not so sure."" Herbert Hoover said that ""Older men declare war. But it is the youth that must fight and die."" Hoover addressing the 1944 Republican National Convention was casting the light of history on the carnage in World War II. Orson Scott Card in his 1977 novella and 1985 novel Enders Game was speaking as a prophet of both military strategy and pop entertainment. He saw the future and it was playing to the death. (READ The Simpsons Matt Selman on the Perfect Enders Game Video Game) Back when the big video game was Super Mario Brothers and decades before U.S. government technicians sent aerial drones half a world away to target enemies in civilian areas Card imagined war as a video game waged by the very young -- their reflexes sharp their minds malleable. Preteens commanded by the precocious Ender stare at a giant screen and aim drone strikes at a real or simulated planet whose insect inhabitants known as ""buggers"" or Formics appear bent on destroying Earth. Press a button and the buggers go BOOM The kids fight but do not die. No pain all gain. Since 1985 and especially in the past dozen or so years the real world caught up with Enders Game. The U.S. Marine Corps placed the novel on its recommended reading list for offering ""lessons in training methodology leadership and ethics."" (You have to wonder if the librarian in charge read the book all the way to the end.) J.K. Rowlings Harry Potter books and Stephenie Meyers Hunger Games quartet adapted Cards notion of a Battle School that instructed children in the dark arts of combat. In Kazuo Ishiguros more troubling novel Never Let Me Go and in the excellent movie made from it a group of children is schooled in preparation for the special sacrifice their nation demands of them. (READ Corlisss review of the film Never Let Me Go) The trope of young soldiers controlling their war machines from afar has become a fixture in dozens of SF movies from Avatar to Pacific Rim. Meanwhile the video-game universe has expanded indeed exploded in craft violence and popularity. Grand Theft Auto V earned more money in a day (800 million) than any movie including Avatar has registered in its entire run in North American theaters. Yet it has taken a long generation for Cards novel to be filmed. Lev Grossman TIMEs book critic and author of several acclaimed science-fiction novels has argued that Enders Game virtually cries out to be a movie -- and also that because of the young characters and daunting special-effects challenges the project is essentially unadaptable. (READ Lev Grossman on Why Enders Game Must Be a Movie and Why It Cant Be) Greed to the rescue. Summit Entertainment the studio that grossed more than 3.3 billion on Meyers Twilight Saga noted last years expiration date on the vampire series and figured that Cards franchise which comprises 13 novels (with more on the way) might fill the void. Hence Summits 110-million investment in a movie whose most prominent players are kids Butterfield star of Martin Scorseses Hugo and as Enders closest comrade in the childrens crusade Hailee Steinfeld of the Coen brothers True Grit. Never mind that Cards fulminations against gay marriage (""marks the end of democracy in America"") and Barack Obama (you know ""Hitler"") have stoked protests against the movie. Breaking news People with crackpot ideas can write important books (cf. Celine). Yes its probable that O.S. Card will not win an Oscar from the liberal members of the Motion Picture Academy. But the pictures target demographics are unlikely to be swayed by GLAAD or the Huffington Post; they just want to see a cool movie this weekend. (READ Orson Scott Card on TIME 100 honoree Stephenie Meyer) Cool -- in the sense of its emotional temperature and steely graphics -- pretty much describes director Gavin Hoods film version. Theres plenty of action both digital (Ender in zero gravity whirling and firing like a gunslinger on a carousel) and fist-to-face (Ender whups a bigger bully adding ""Just remember what I do to people who try to hurt me""). But the color scheme is neutral muted a murmur of institutional grays and pastels like that of the 1982 SF movie Tron and its 2010 sequel -- not surprising since production designer Sean Haworth and costumer Christine Bieselin Clark both worked on Tron Legacy. (READ Mary Pols review of Tron Legacy) The book and the movie both focus on the basic training of Ender and his fellow cadets with tough Sergeant Dap (Nonso Anozie from Game of Thrones) shouting at the kids as if this were a middle-school fantasy remake of Full Metal Jacket; say Full Metal Rocket. But Daps tone lacks the fury of malevolence. (Add an ""I"" to that word and you get male violence.) The sick passion of brutality is left to the teen boys who foolishly test Enders fighting skills and resolve. In fact the movies only verklempt moment comes when Dap smiles and salutes Ender -- a grunt acknowledging a genius. A gifted child or a sociopath or a bit of both? Ender is the youngest of three children and the books big question Is whether he more closely resembles his sadistic brother Peter (Jimmy Pinchak) or his sweet sister Valentine (Abigail Breslin)? The movie forfeits that suspense since Butterfield who turned 15 when Enders Game was being shot last year has the giant blue bathyspheric eyes and otherworldly winsomeness of Elijah Woods Frodo. Hes a star child on Earth. (FIND The Lord of the Rings on the all-TIME 100 Movies list) The movies Ender resorts to defending himself only when all negotiations have failed. The forces roiling his soul are mostly external his rival cadets and no less his commanders Graff and senior psychiatrist Anderson (Viola Davis) who engage in logorrheic debates over the boys state of mind and the legendary warrior Mazer Rackham (Ben Kingsley whos a visual and auditory hoot in Maori tattoos and his most curious accent since he played the Mandarin in Iron Man Three). Ender gets odder messages from the video game he plays in his brief spare time. The insect planet holds a secret and dear Valentine beckons to him. Rarely throbbing with preadolescent thrills like the old Saturday-matinee serials that most SF means to co-opt but almost always impressive the Enders Game movie marks an encouraging step up for its screenwriter-director. Born and bred in South Africa Hood won but did not earn an Oscar for the social drama Tsotsi then directed the somnolent political film Rendition and the non-whelming X-Men Origins Wolverine. (READ Corlisss review of X-Men Origins Wolverine) Somehow this time Hood found the resources to guide his child-dominated cast and his gifted visual-effects team. The film channels a hundred artifacts of pop culture -- antediluvian video games like Space Invaders and Tom Cruises orchestra-conductor gestures at a computer screen from MInority Report -- but in a contemplative almost dreamy fashion. Enders Game is like its protagonist sturdy wary and bright. And while the picture loses some plot tension by assuring the viewer that Ender is basically an okay kid it gains by showing the growth of the boy into his destiny as ""the One."" Orson Scott Card might disapprove of the connection but Ender is in no way Hitler. Hes more like the early hope of Obama.

Which for the record is straightforward a bit literal-minded very faithful to the book and largely compelling. On one level its just a coincidence of the calendar that ""Enders Game"" and ""12 Years a Slave"" and the Matthew McConaughey AIDS drama ""Dallas Buyers Club"" and the Polish thriller ""Aftermath"" are all hitting at the same time all of them in very different ways posing thorny questions about how we deal with traumatic events of the past. But not all coincidence is random and its human nature to see patterns in events we do not understand.The movie on that list you probably havent heard about is writer-director Wladyslaw Pasikowskis ""Aftermath"" - but you definitely would have if you lived in Poland where the picture has provoked outrage from right-wing nationalists. It depicts a sleepy bucolic rural village as a hotbed of sinister buried secrets epitomized by one farmers discovery that the headstones from a vanished Jewish cemetery have been used to pave a country road. Even though no living person in town directly participated in the persecution and murder of the Jewish families who once lived there the villagers have their reasons for not wanting the truth revealed and even for resorting to violence in order to suppress it. ""Aftermath"" almost feels like a horror movie with a pervasive mood of malice and fear about people whose parents and grandparents collaborated with mass murderers but who have convinced themselves that they are historys victims.Theres a strange and striking consonance between the themes of ""Aftermath"" and ""Enders Game"" even though you could hardly imagine more disparate kinds of films. Both stories are about a kind of historical dementia or myopia used to create insane justifications for inexcusable acts. (Yes Im likely to issue ""Enders Game"" plot spoilers; you are forewarned.) Boy-genius Ender Wiggin - played in the film by 16-year-old English actor Asa Butterfield (""Hugo"") although the character is meant to be much younger than that - has his own graveyard epiphany of sorts after leading a genocidal campaign against an antlike alien species that hes been told is planning an all-out war on Earth. (Card calls them the ""buggers"" a word not used in the movie.)Hoods screenplay cannot do this aspect of ""Enders Game"" justice in less than two hours; the hidden relationship between Ender and the buggers runs throughout Cards book as a dreamlike countercurrent to the surface story about the brutal training of a killer. (The buggers communicate with Ender through a surreal and disturbing video game one of various ways that Card anticipated the technological and cultural future.) Still the storys melancholy penitent denouement is a bizarre reversal not quite like anything else in the imaginative literature of war. Its as if an SS death-camp commander indoctrinated to believe that the Jews were a despicable alien virus in Aryan Europe had all along been listening to Mahler and Mendelssohn reading Kafka and Proust but only understood after the fact that he had a unique spiritual connection to the race he had labored so hard to exterminate.We never learn much about the future Earth society of ""Enders Game"" (again somewhat more in the book than the movie) but the military leaders who have selected and trained Ender have a lot in common with the backward Polish villagers of ""Aftermath."" Growly Col. Hyrum Graff (Harrison Ford) who serves as Enders surrogate father offers a chilling twist on the tough-love military archetype found in so many coming-of-age stories. Despite his paternalistic manner toward Ender Graff only cares about the boy as an instrument of destruction - the way Oppenheimer cared about the Bomb - and actively resists learning anything about bugger civilization or considering the possibility that humans have misunderstood the aliens intentions. Its always crucial for a genocidal murderer to present himself as a historical victim who is fighting for survival and has no choice. This was precisely Hitlers argument to the German people and exactly what the sadistic slave-owners wife played by Sarah Paulson in ""12 Years a Slave"" argues If we dont crush them they will cut our throats.Theres been considerable debate about the conflicted themes and messages of ""Enders Game"" over the years as well as about Cards peculiar personal politics and his open hostility toward homosexuality and LGBT rights. I think thats a tribute to the works enduring potency as well as a reminder that you dont have to be a nice person to write an important book. I also think that the moral and philosophical confusion of ""Enders Game"" is an aspect of its greatness; its a story not a political essay. At its core Cards book is about the psychic connection between war and child abuse two of the worst things that happen in human society. Yeah theres also a moral quandary slathered on top about human society confronting an alien species it cant communicate with and believes to be hostile. But theres no interesting solution to that hypothetical problem despite its accidental resemblance to the Cheney-Rumsfeld rationale for invading Iraq. Anyway that whole aspect of the story is not half as memorable as the tormented Christ-like ego of Ender an abused child who is simultaneously victim villain and saint -- historys greatest war criminal and the shamanic conduit to a vanished race. You Might Also Like As a devout Mormon and a direct descendant of Brigham Young Orson Card is well acquainted with the history of the Anglo settlement of the American West. ""Enders Game"" can definitely be read as an allegorical treatment of the other American original sin besides slavery the destruction and replacement of Native American society which stood in the way of our nations manifest destiny. The sentimental idea that whites who killed or uprooted the Indians became infused with their spiritual or moral essence did not begin with New Agers in the 1960s. It goes clear back to the invented legend of the first Thanksgiving feast and the apocryphal peace treaty between William Penn and the Lenape chief Tamanend (aka Tammany) in 1683. Indeed it was a staple of American popular literature in the 19th century. Some aspects of Joseph Smiths original Latter-day Saint theology which have been swept under the rug in Mormonisms corporate era relied on the then-popular hypothesis that Native Americans were actually the Lost Tribes of Israel.As I wrote two weeks ago one of the subjects of Steve McQueens Oscar-bound ""12 Years a Slave"" is the enormous psychic cost inflicted on Americans of all races by the legacy of slavery. It is one thing to become dehumanized as Chiwetel Ejiofors character is in that film because you are held in bondage beaten and forced to do or endure terrible things in order to survive. It is quite another to become dehumanized like the Paulson and Michael Fassbender characters by a pernicious ideology that teaches you that your freedom depends on the subjugation of others and to refuse for generations afterward any serious discussion of its consequences. Whatever Cards conscious intentions may have been in ""Enders Game"" and whatever degree of sentimentality or sadomasochistic fantasy we may see in the work it never flinches from the idea that a grievous historical crime has been committed whose consequences are dire and long-lasting and for which amends must be made.It does not strike me as entirely accidental that all these works about the price of the past are coming forward in the current political context when a significant but angry minority of Americans is committed to undoing or rewriting as much history as possible. It should be obvious by now that the right-wing fixation on repealing or defunding Obamacare is symbolic rather than substantive. Its a political dispute that appears to be about the present and about matters of policy but is really about the past. Most opponents of the presidents healthcare bill neither know nor care whether it contains elements of ""socialism"" (which it doesnt). Whats at stake is the ability to roll back reality as with a spell learned at Tea-Party Hogwarts. If this aspect of a hated new American reality can be undone then so at least in the world of right-wing magical thinking can everything else. Obama himself can cease to exist - in the pornographic fantasies of birthers he has never actually been president -- gay people and their marriages can melt back into the closet and women can vanish from corporate boardrooms only to reappear in the kitchen with an apron and a spatula. Civil-rights laws will unwrite themselves millions of immigrants will turn out never to have come here the entire federal government will be revealed as a useless and unnecessary fiction. The Civil War itself can be relitigated by other means with a different outcome (accepting for the moment the conventional view that the North actually won). None of this is even remotely coherent except that it all belongs to a fantasy narrative in which white heterosexual males are historys most persecuted and marginalized group having absorbed all the suffering of the African-Americans and Jews and Indians and women and improved upon it in their inimitable style.Forces that we thought were dead in American public life like the ideology of white supremacy and the legacy of the Confederacy have returned in zombie form imbued with bathos and victimology. If theyre not half as powerful as they once were theyre still too ugly to be ignored. As weve seen all too recently the deranged American minority that longs to ""take our country back"" from unspecified usurpers is zealous well organized and determined to befoul our political life into the indefinite future. Those forces remain dangerous like Col. Graff in ""Enders Game"" and the Polish villagers of ""Aftermath"" but like them cannot unmake reality. There is no blissful white-bread past to return to because it never existed in the first place; the roads everywhere are paved with tombstones. History literally is not on their side.

Writer-director Gavin Hood (X-Men Origins Wolverine) presents the material so solemnly that this big-screen adaptation feels like a biblical epic; theres no comic relief or even spontaneous behavior. If you dislike child actors you might derive a perverse satisfaction from seeing dozens of them look so unhappy to be onscreen.

The films young space warriors preparing for an alien invasion spend lots of time in zero-g training and simulations resembling video games so the special effects are plentiful and theyre dazzling. But ""Enders Game"" also says something about the morality of war. The movie is based on the popular 1985 young adult novel of the same title by Orson Scott Card. It posits a future when children because of their reflexes and ability to think intuitively are expected to lead the charge to rebuff an attack from antlike creatures called Formics who devastated Earth in a previous invasion attempt. Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield of ""Hugo"") is sent to Battle School after catching the eyes of military commanders by how he handles a bullying classmate - with dispatch. Hes extremely intelligent insightful about opponents and a master strategist which means he may be the leader they are seeking. The cadets are put into competing groups under tough drill sergeants (shades of ""Full Metal Jacket"") and play a combat game under weightless conditions that bears more than a passing resemblance to Quidditch - one of the films nods to ""Harry Potter."" Enders training becomes increasingly harrowing befitting the fate-of-mankind stakes. The school confronts him with ethical questions raised not only by conflicts with aggressive classmates but in large-scale military situations. The film is centered in the culture of video gaming which is at the heart of the cadets training and seems designed to bring out their killer instincts. The story implicitly criticizes that culture but at the same time the movie exploits its visceral thrills. Most viewers will envy Enders ability to negotiate gracefully every social situation - for him taunts are easily deflected and friends made and toughies are dealt with swiftly. But its to the films credit that Ender isnt quirkily likable - he has a darker and more calculating edge thats undeniable. The theme of bullying is a constant here and its seen as the root of Enders clear authoritarian streak. The key question Will he come to some sort of self-knowledge? The acting is good for this sort of megabudget FX effort. Notable young characters in Enders life include Hailee Steinfeld (""True Grit"") as one of his Battle School mates Abigail Breslin as his compassionate sister and Moises Arias as a squadron leader and bully. Among the handful of adults who help mold Ender are Harrison Ford aptly cast as the colonel who monitors his training with advice from a military psychologist played by Viola Davis. Later Ben Kingsley turns up resplendent in Maori tattoos and employing a curious accent as the brilliant military mind who rebuffed the first Formic invasion. Director Gavin Hood (""Tsotsi"" ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"") gives us an extremely good-looking film - you see every penny of the budget - and he handles the ethical questions with efficiency. There are times when a certain grimness weighs on the movie that you wish for more humor. But overall its an absorbing and thought-provoking spectacle. Enders Game Sci-fi action adventure. Directed by Gavin Hood. With Asa Butterfield Harrison Ford Hailee Steinfeld Ben Kingsley. (Rated PG-13. 114 minutes.) Walter Addiego is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

"Enders Game adapted from Orson Scott Cards novel reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Enders Game A Movie Only Card-Carrying Orson Scott Card Fans Could Love Enders Game A Movie Only Card-Carrying Orson Scott Card Fans Could Love Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 1 2013 614 PM Enders Game A future in which young people are both celebrities and cannon fodder. By Dana Stevens Ben Kingsley as Mazer Rackham and Asa Butterfield as Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggin in Enders Game. Film still courtesy Lions Gate/Summit Entertainment Its an odd week when you follow up a review of a movie about a homophobe--Jean-Marc Vallees excellent Dallas Buyers Club--with a review of a movie by a homophobe or rather based on a best-selling book by a very prominent one. Before the release of Enders Game an adaptation by writer-director Gavin Hood of the sci-fi novel by Orson Scott Card I knew of Card primarily as an anti-gay-marriage crusader and vocal right-wing crank. In a column from last spring that falls at the exact midpoint between sci-fi thought experiment and paranoid screed Card compares President Obama to Hitler and envisions him amassing an army of ""Brown Shirts--thugs who will do his bidding without any reference to law."" Where will this paramilitary force be recruited? Among ""young out-of-work urban men"" of course. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Thankfully none of that ideological ugliness finds its way into the film version of Enders Game. Nonetheless this effects-heavy but still slight-seeming movie has a strangely tractlike quality It seems to be intending some lesson or moral that as a nonreader of the book I never quite got. Like After Earth--another recent movie about a barely-adolescent boy forced to grow up fast on a dangerous voyage to outer space--Enders Game unfolds in an airless abstracted world that seems to have little relation to our own. Its a shame because Enders Games central premise--that in the future after a catastrophic planetary invasion by antlike aliens known as Formics Earths leaders will use children to lead the super-high-tech counterattack because of their superior brain plasticity and intuition--is an idea thats full of possibilities. First of all theres the dystopic fantasy common to the Hunger Games series of a future where the young people our culture now (at least nominally) shelters from harm have become both its cannon fodder and its media celebrities. And then theres the potential for satire in the films portrait of a hyper-militarized culture of heroism--or even perhaps a Matrix-esque religious allegory embedded in its story about a young boy Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield of Hugo) whom the head of the kid-training unit of the armed forces Col. Graff (Harrison Ford) believes to be in essence the One. Ender learns the rules of both zero-gravity combat and inter-adolescent social politics--the latter is significantly trickier. Advertisement Enders promise as a supreme military commander isnt derived solely from his badass first name. Hes a rare-in-the-future third child--the authorities made an exception for his birth because his siblings were near perfect genetic matches for the profile of the ideal leader. And while hes physically small--Butterfield is 16 but looks more like 12--Ender is both a brilliant tactician and when pushed to the limit a ruthless opponent. Its after he puts down a bully with such extreme prejudice the kid nearly dies that Col. Graff pulls him out of school--and off planet Earth--to join an elite training camp on a space station. The boot-camp training sequences that make up the bulk of the rest of the movie have their moments--particularly those having to do with the friendship that develops between Ender and a female fellow recruit Petra (Hailee Steinfeld). Petra takes it upon herself to familiarize Ender with the rules of both zero-gravity combat and inter-adolescent social politics--as you can imagine the latter is significantly trickier. As Ender moves rapidly up the ranks he comes to be resented and bullied by his teenage commander Bonzo (played by Moises Arias an actor so tiny he makes the not-at-all-strapping Butterfield look huge creating a comic effect Im not sure was intended in this studiedly serious movie). Theres a nice scene in which Ender and Petra visit the gravity-free chamber of the space station at night for some free-floating target practice but thanks to this PG-13 films aggressive squeaky-cleanness we dont even get the fun of a zero-gravity kiss. ""This is basic rocket science people"" an impatient professor tells her unresponsive class in one of their early battle simulations. But as battle school wears on the simulations grow ever more complex and the tablet-based ""mind games"" Ender plays as part of his special training grow ever trippier. (The sequences in which we enter into these creepy animated games from Enders point of view are among the movies best.) Viola Davis appears as a lower-ranking battle-school officer who tries in vain to convince Fords gruff honcho to incorporate the faintest tinge of compassion into their training protocols but both Ford and the movie treat her as window dressing. Sir Ben Kingsley also pops up for a short and rather silly cameo as a legendary Formic-destroyer with a face covered in Maori tattoos. The ending aspires to a moral ponderousness that the rest of the movie cant quite support (I will say no more for fear of spoiling a fairly guessable but not unclever final twist). Gay activist groups have proposed a boycott of Enders Game to which Card (who has a producers credit) has responded that he wont personally profit from the film having received a flat fee for the rights long ago. (Anyway Card already made his fortune from the 1985 best-seller in which the insectoid invaders are referred to straight-up as ""Buggers."") I can understand wanting to skip Enders Game as a matter of moral principle but you can also feel free to blow it off just because its not that good.

Richard Foreman Jr./Summit Entertainment hide caption toggle caption Richard Foreman Jr./Summit Entertainment Ender (Asa Butterfield) is a prodigy military cadet being trained by a team of adults -- including Mazer Rackham (Ben Kingsley) -- to fend off a hostile alien race in a much-discussed adaptation of Enders Game. Richard Foreman Jr./Summit Entertainment Enders Game Director Gavin Hood Genre Sci-fi action Running Time 114 minutes Rated PG-13 for some violence sci-fi action and thematic material. With Asa Butterfield Hailee Steinfeld Harrison Ford Ben Kingsley Viola Davis ""When the war is over we can debate the morality of what we do."" This sentiment expressed by Harrison Fords gruff Col. Hyrum Graff pretty accurately sums up what director and screenwriter Gavin Hood is trying to do in his adaptation of the widely read 1985 sci-fi novel Enders Game. If war is inevitable his film asks -- and if the enemy plays by no discernible rules -- then what lengths can and should a military go to in order to avoid annihilation? Does victory in the name of self-defense justify employing any and all means to survive? Or does a morally reprehensible victory permanently stain the victors? These are big questions for the first entry in what Summit Entertainment plainly hopes will be a franchise to fill the teen-fantasy void left by the wrap-up of the more thematically lightweight Twilight series. And its to the films credit that it tackles them at all without offering any easy or clear-cut answers. If only Hoods acumen for storytelling and characterization were just as lofty. To be fair the plot- and subplot-dense book isnt an easy candidate for adaptation so Hoods strategy is necessarily a reductive one. The world of the book -- a future Earth dealing with the aftermath of a devastating barely rebuffed alien invasion -- includes extensive forays into earthbound politics subplots concerning the family of the title character and a timeline that takes years to play out. i Enders primary trainer Col. Graff (Harrison Ford) employs a series of mind games and cruelties in an attempt to toughen the boy and sharpen his instincts. Richard Foreman Jr./Summit Entertainment hide caption toggle caption Richard Foreman Jr./Summit Entertainment Enders primary trainer Col. Graff (Harrison Ford) employs a series of mind games and cruelties in an attempt to toughen the boy and sharpen his instincts. Richard Foreman Jr./Summit Entertainment In adapting that source material Hood compresses it like coal into a diamond crushing in on the story arc of cadet Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) whos part of an adolescent army being raised by an international military authority. The theory is that the dexterity and malleability of young minds and bodies can be used to create a fighting force with near-instinctual tactical brilliance and adaptability. And Ender is a prodigy innately gifted in all aspects of command and combat referred to by Graff in messianic terms as ""the one."" But even a promised child needs some molding and Graffs agenda for Ender includes cruel psychological manipulations that isolate the boy during training and foster resentment among his fellow cadets and even crueler manipulations when battle is at hand. The morality of that handling is what Graff is putting off defending in conversation with Maj. Anderson (Viola Davis) the officer in charge of monitoring Enders state of mind. Their ongoing push and pull is one threaded throughout the film with rather annoying gender-tagged simplicity. Graff is always concerned with making Ender tougher; Anderson is mostly concerned with his feelings. Similarly Enders father supports Enders use of violence as a tactical strategy to deal with bullies; mom isnt convinced. Ender finds kindness from Petra (Hailee Steinfeld) a female cadet and cruelty from his squad leader Bonzo (Moises Arias). Meanwhile Ender tries to balance the dual natures he sees within himself -- one of sociopathic violence that he associates with his older brother the other of empathy which he ties to his sister. Look we get it already Men are thugs women are nurturers. The lack of dimension extends beyond the core characters to most of the supporting cast of largely interchangeable cadets. When theyre given any kind of characterization its usually to fulfill a one-note archetype the plucky misfit the bully with deep-seated insecurities. It would be nice if Hood had put as much effort into these characters as into the look of the film which is slick crisp and clean to the point of being antiseptic. The cadets do much of their training in virtual-reality simulators and their real world sometimes seems just as meticulously planned and constructed. That attention to detail does pay off in the training and battle set pieces and those sequences keep the film moving even when theyre weighed down by the grim pall that Hood keeps as the movies consistent tone. It may seem odd for a teen-focused action movie to feel so glum but thats actually something that the director gets right even if it threatens to make this a dull affair Enders Game is a dark story of a childrens crusade built on the crushed psyches of damaged youths and too much uplift would undermine it. As it is when the films young hero does get around to debating the morality of what hes done the movie is nearly over and the ensuing sequel-setup conclusion feels far too rushed to give the fundamental question of the movie its due. But at least Enders Game has the courage to ask it.

Grade B For readers of Orson Scott Cards best-selling sci-fi book the movie version of ""Enders Game"" should provide a swift punchy precis. For those who come to it fresh as I did it will register as a tantalizing ""what-if movie."" What if a childrens army were led not by Third World warlords but by a tough sage American - say Harrison Ford? What if he exploited his gifted kids abilities - their quick absorption of complex data and mastery of cutting-edge digital games - so that theyd be ready to fight real apocalyptic battles? Of course the army here goes to outer space and the ""real"" battles are waged against giant insect aliens. But the fascination of ""Enders Game"" lies in the way its far-out futuristic story mirrors contemporary reality. Kids power to outstrip grownups in a high-tech learning curve becomes the reason to overturn the traditional wisdom that ""you dont send a boy to do a mans job."" Whats unsettling is that Ender the child who may be humanitys savior really is fresh-faced and scrawny a beanpole of a kid. Asa Butterfield 14 when the film was shot plays him as a sensitive 12-year-old not even close to firming up his own identity. In Cards intricate mythology Ender knows the one reason he was born was to become a potential warrior. (Hes a ""Third"" at a time when couples are restricted to two kids.) His older brother Peter (Jimmy Pinchak) washed out of the program because he was too eager for violence. His older sister Valentine (Abigail Breslin) proved to be too compassionate for warfare. He must get things right. The movie toys with our sympathies in multiple ways. Ender can be a brutally logical tactician who uses overkill to prevent attacks whether by classroom bullies or alien ""buggers."" But hes also an empathic misfit who strives to understand his enemies and can mold other square pegs into a band of brothers and sisters. Fords character Colonel Graff manipulates him ruthlessly; psychologist Major Gwen Anderson (Viola Davis) questions Graffs attempts to toughen him up and isolate him as a leader. Yet if Graff comes close to breaking Ender he also brings out the boys strategic talent. With the help of his collaborator on ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" cinematographer Donald McAlpine writer-director Gavin Hood has made a sleeker smarter fantasy than that leaden superhero film. Like most movies ""Enders Game"" could use more laughs but theres some built-in black humor to seeing junior school and high school kids endure scenes derived from ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""From Here to Eternity."" Adult and youthful actors alike perform with bona fide conviction including Ben Kingsley as Earths previous savior Moises Arias as a tyrannical squad leader and Hailee Steinfeld as Enders best pal looking more at ease than she ever did in ""Romeo and Juliet."" The movies ""wow"" effects come when Ender and his mighty tykes pull off wily team formations in Earths orbiting Battle School. The final two-stage climax is a bit of a letdown aesthetically - and one huge save morally. The movie ends up specializing in a kind of dynamic ambivalence. It makes you distrust military triumph and hope for a stable peace.

We all have our own personal laundry lists of books we spent our childhoods poring over that wound up getting sapped of their original spark and power on the way to the big screen. I could be wrong but I suspect that diehard fans of Orson Scott Cards 1985 sci-fi allegory Enders Game might walk out of Gavin Hoods lavish eye-candy adaptation with a similar sensation -- that theyve spent more than two decades waiting for what ends up being an oddly lifeless and emotionally unaffecting film. For the uninitiated Enders Game is the story of 12-year-old Ender Wiggin (Hugos Asa Butterfield) a shy loner with a beautiful mind. His gift if it can be called that considering what happens in the last third of the film is that hes a bit of savant when it comes to strategy and analyzing thorny no-win situations. Hed give Captain Kirk a serious run at Star Treks Kobayashi Maru scenario. This is a particularly valuable skill set in the wake of a devastating attack on Earth years earlier by an alien insect race called the Formics. There are reports that these intergalactic praying mantises are about to launch a second assault and the military powers that be are scouring our planet looking for the best and the brightest to outwit these blood-thirsty beasties. Harrison Ford all gravel and growl plays Col. Hyrum Graff the head of recruiting. He sees in Ender the last best hope for Earths survival And a child shall lead them?and all of that. He taps Ender for a spot in the elite Battle School where he faces down bullies using his unique brand of psychological jujitsu. The problem is these initiation and training scenes go on forever. He forms a sort of chaste romance with a fellow cadet (True Grits Hailee Steinfeld) becomes an ace at an anti-gravity laser-tag variation of Quidditch and earns the grudging respect of his classmates. While the movie looks stunning its also all a bit dull. I kept thinking what Enders Game could have used was some of the fizz and subversive bite of Paul Verhoevens Starship Troopers. Cards public stance against gay marriage has been controversial but none of those views have made it into the film. The movie actually contains an anti-bullying theme of tolerance. Mostly its a harmless slightly clunky story in which the undercooked plot and unremarkable performances fail to match the visual ambition. The revelations in the films downbeat but satisfying final act hint at deeper wrinkles that were ironed out of the novel on its journey to the multiplex. But by the time the movie finally manages to get interesting audiences may be too numb and their retinas too fried to win back.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Oct. 31 2013 1244PM EDT Last updated Thursday Oct. 31 2013 1244PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Gavin Hood Written by Gavin Hood Starring Asa Butterfield Harrison Ford and Viola Davis Classification PG Country USA Language English Some chilly ideas trump conventional movie spectacle in Enders Game a promising if risky start to what is intended to be a blockbuster franchise for Summit Entertainment (producers of the 3.3-billion Twilight series).Directed by the versatile South African director Gavin Hood (X-Men Origins Wolverine; Rendition; Tsotsi) the film follows the education of an adolescent boy Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield of Hugo and The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas) in a dystopian future where gifted children are selected for their cunning and ruthlessness to lead humans in a war against ant-like alien invaders called Formics. Handout / AP Video Video Weekend movie pick Enders Game hits the big screen The story which provides an opportunity to grapple with issues of bullying violent video games and sociopathic leaders has parallels to the Harry Potter and Hunger Games series though Enders Game at least in its book form predates those blockbusters. The movie is adapted from a 1985 novel by Orson Scott Card the first in a bestselling series.While that kind of material is catnip for movie producers Card is a liability for his published anti-gay views. (DC Comics faced protests this year after selecting him to contribute to its Adventures of Superman series and put his storyline on indefinite hold). Yet compelling science fiction has often been created by novelists who were less than admirable people.The story starts five decades after a massive attack from an alien invasion was narrowly repelled thanks to the heroics of one young leader Mazer Rackham who apparently died in combat. Since then Earths brain trust has held to the maxim that ""the worlds smartest children are our best hope."" Theyve been on the lookout for exceptional individuals to counter the Formics swarming attacks.All kids are fitted with an implanted monitor to see if they demonstrate the right stuff and a select few are sent to a Battle School space station in Earths orbit. There they train in video-game-like simulators under the observation of military tactician Colonel Hyrum Graff (Harrison Ford) and psychologist Major Gwen Anderson (Viola Davis) who are attempting to locate the next Caesar or Napoleon.The leading candidate is Ender. Hes a puny unpopular kid who has demonstrated unusual resourcefulness against bullies. Though not as aggressive as his out-of-control brother Peter (Jimmy ""Jax"" Pinchak) or blessed with the emotional intelligence of his compassionate sister Valentine (Abigail Breslin) Ender can fight or outwit on a case-by-case basis. Butterfield with his cold blue-eyed glare and aura of wounded rage is a chillingly convincing dictator in training.His colleagues at the Battle School who have to be outsmarted or won over include the helpful Petra (True Grits Hailee Steinfeld) and unrelenting rival Moises Arias (Bonzo Madrid). Battle practices are like elaborate games of gravity-fee laser tag (the cool clean production design and costumes are from the team behind 2010s Tron Legacy) with contestants gliding about in aerial formations using girders as protection as they pick each other off. In the end Ender distinguishes himself from his rivals by his willingness to sacrifice teammates in order to achieve victory.In the last act when Ender graduates to Command School hes met by a mysterious new mentor played by Butterfields Hugo co-star Ben Kingsley. Enders progress is chronicled and debated by his military instructors. ""It used to be a war crime to recruit anyone under the age of 15"" worries Daviss Anderson who has allowed Ender to tap into a computer game to monitor his inner battle between aggression and compassion. In contrast Fords Graff is all about military training insisting the teen must face all rigours of war in preparation for the real event. The emotional core of the film is between Ender and Graff with the teen anxious to make his substitute father proud while Graff is trying to build a better killing machine.The casting of Ford draws inevitable comparisons to Star Wars another movie about a specially chosen space fighter but Enders Game has neither the humour nor naivete of George Lucass boy-hero pop-culture phenomenon arguably to its detriment.Ultimately the movie is not to paraphrase the U.S. Army slogan all that it could be. The climax is uninvolving generic eye candy and the sequel-friendly coda is unconvincing. Yet the desire to see how Enders killer-with-a-conscience character evolves and to see Butterfield develop as an actor makes this one of those rare movies where a sequel would be useful and welcome.

Its almost a relief that Enders Game has turned out to be a glum bore onscreen a far-future cadets-in-space military drama whose pretensions to moral inquiry boil down to the guilt a kid may feel after stepping on an anthill. If the film had turned out grand like the best of the novel its based on many potential viewers would have faced a true dilemma Is it ethical to support the creative work of a man who has loudly and proudly declared himself to be on the wrong side of the great civil rights battle of the day? A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Its not news that Enders Game author Orson Scott Card is a homophobic turd who has declared that anyone caught ""flagrantly"" engaging in gay sex ""cannot be permitted to remain as acceptable equal citizens within that society."" Or that in May of this year he posted to his website a ""silly thought experiment"" in which he likened Barack Obama to Hitler and predicted that the president will militarize ""urban gangs"" and ""send them out to channel their violence against [his] enemies.""Ill leave to you the question of whether its right to buy a ticket to an adaptation of this mans imaginings. Instead I ask you to consider how his personal failings compromise the work itself. One calling of the serious science-fiction writer is to craft a learned projection of what we and our universe might become. For all his smart work on future tech and the nature of war Card has failed to imagine the egalitarianism of even the human present much less that of centuries from now. Enders Game first published in 1985 offers one of those jumpsuit futures where all the clothes and people seem to have come out of a spigot like frozen yogurt -- its somehow less egalitarian than the real world just three decades after it was written.Film Details Enders Game RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time114 More Info In Gavin Hoods movie Ender gets shipped off to Harrison Fords Earth-orbiting ""Battle School"" a sort of Hogwarts for future war criminals. His mission to become the kiddo military officer so ruthless and savvy he can lead humanity to victory against the insectoid aliens who attacked Earth some 20 years prior. The gifted white kid is always surrounded by brown- and black-skinned classmates but the story gives them nothing to do but react to Ender -- to marvel at his intelligence to envy his victories to salute him warmly when hes promoted ahead of them.Briefly Ender is subordinate to a cruel Latino commander who keeps calling him ""pendejo"" a rare case of any character here expressing anything resembling an ethnic identity. That builds to many scenes of brilliant Ender showing up Bonzo the hot-blooded lug who eventually resorts to dumb violence not far removed from what Card dreams Obamas gangs might try. Ender of course prevails -- and then feels bad that he had to fight. If only Bonzo would have known his placeWhat makes Ender so great? Hes just born that way like Harry Potter Luke Skywalker or anyone who has ever believed that the color of their skin confers upon them some natural superiority. Card has envisioned a far-off tomorrow where most non-whites understand their subordinate position to white leaders despite the fact that even today white folks are a global minority. This guy wasnt writing of a possible future; he was dreaming of a lost South.Some of the movie isnt bad. Ford as high commander muckety-muck spends a lot of time scheming to harden and sharpen Ender to strip away his humanity and build a better killer. Hes amusingly gruff as he pushes Ender and the kids-club military not just to victory against the aliens but toward perpetrating a full genocide -- an ugly resonant idea the filmmakers make a hash of but that Card handles well in the book. Asa Butterfield plays Ender as a keyed-up kid who has learned to affect a persuasive calmness. He sells the many repetitive scenes of Ender outwitting everyone but hes not up to the high emotions of the final reels probably because the movie isnt either -- in the last half hour the most momentous events in the history of our universe pass by in a bewildering rush.The ridiculousness outweighs those few strong qualities. Battle School centers on one of those stupid Quidditch-style competitions whose rules include an automatic-win condition only Ender and Harry Potter are smart enough to go for. Everything comes so easy for Ender that his big challenge before the climax is to learn to delegate -- thats not drama thats an anecdote for a job interview. Attacked in the showers Ender manages to scald a boy with water from a nozzle he had just been standing nude beneath and we have to watch him play terrible personality-testing dream-vision video games that are even less engaging than all the scenes of him playacting as a space commander in combat simulators. The space battles dont have the usual problem of looking like video games; instead they have the unusual problem of looking like terrifically cluttered screensavers. Everyone still says ""email"" which I guess means theres hope for the postal service. And the big twist which I wont spoil manages to be simultaneously absurd and predictable.In the end our hero learns the encouraging lesson that alien races are worth trying to understand.

Its the kind of responsibility that could paralyze any man but Ender isnt any man. In fact hes not a man at all. Hes a 10-year-old boy. In some ways Orson Scott Cards ""Enders Game"" is Robert Heinleins ""Starship Troopers"" rewritten as a young-adult novel but with the same monstrous insect invaders and clear-eyed conformist defenders. Its about Us vs. Them and winning that war at all costs. Both books unsurprisingly are often on the reading lists at U.S. armed-forces academies (and occasionally questioned by liberal critics). Theyre full of military strategies and pragmatic morals. But thats what makes the big-budget movie of ""Enders Game"" a bit of a disappointment. It softens Enders actions. It nearly eliminates several important characters and downplays some of the books more complicated themes. And although the movies vision of drone attacks and pre-emptive war couldnt be more topical too much of the film is taken up with zero-gravity laser tag and point-and-click computer warfare -- genocide reduced to a videogame. Card once thought his book was unfilmable. Perhaps hes right. Its been brought to the screen here by Gavin Hood who started out well with ""Tsotsi"" but then did the obvious ""Rendition"" and -- his only other genre movie -- the poor ""X-Men Origins Wolverine."" Hoods credited with the screenplay here and he keeps the basic concept of a world where cyber-obsessed children have been identified as potentially perfect high-tech soldiers and are sent to boot camp while still grade-schoolers. The brightest of them though is Ender whose aggressive approach to conflict -- basically a willingness to come to every knifefight with a bazooka -- has marked him as the Earths greatest hope. The movies cast is a mix. There is real nostalgia in seeing a silver-haired Harrison Ford as the colonel in charge of training children to take his place (done better this could have been his ""The Cowboys""). Viola Davis is a warm mother figure and Hailee Steinfeld certainly looks more comfortable in outer space than she did in ""Romeo and Juliet."" But Ben Kingsley treads dangerously close to absurdity as a tattooed Maori military man and Moises Arias makes Bonzo Madrid no more believable than his name. And its strangely hard to warm to Asa Butterfield as Ender who -- despite his regularly teary eyes and rebellious provocations -- still seems a little too contained. The sets are marvelous particularly the rocketships and spacestations where much of the childrens training takes place. But when it comes to character and action Hood seems clueless. Like ""The Hunger Games"" and the Harry Potter saga this is a story about the maturation of a personality -- a misfit called to greatness -- yet we dont really see Ender learning anything let alone changing. Two major scenes revolve around war games yet we never really know the rules or where the players are in relation to each other. Its all weightless. It should be noted that as ""Enders Game"" neared release there was a movement against it because of the novelists public (and strident) anti-gay views. Activists studied the screenplay for bias and spoke of boycotting the film as a way of striking back. Personally I dont see any prejudice in the story (although Im very glad it uses the name ""Formics"" for the aliens and not the one Card first used in his story ""Buggers""). Nor does it seem that if were not boycotting Mike Tyson or Roman Polanski we need to shun Orson Scott Card. But as for ""Enders Game"" itself -- well I dont think people are going to need pickets to keep them away. Ratings note The film contains violence. Enders Game (PG-13) Summit (114 min.) Directed by Gavin Hood. With Asa Butterfield Harrison Ford Hailee Steinfeld. Now playing in New Jersey.",http://www.nj.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2013/11/enders_game_review_interplanetary_war_turned_into_a_videogame.html,200,ender'sgame16,ender'sgame,nj

Combined with timing thats not the films fault and one-dimensional characters that are Enders becomes a solemn march through material that could have been thought-provoking.VIDEO Game enjoys a star-studded LA premiereSTORY Lionsgate responds to calls for Enders Game boycottREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersSet in a dystopian future Earth (arent they all?) where kids serve as our elite soldiers Enders posits that mankind is girding for another alien invasion by the ant-like Formics who nearly wiped out the planet last time they dropped by.Enter Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) a scrawny genius who talks his way out of most disputes and ends the rest brutally and finally. The pre-teens steely nerve earns the attention of Col. Hyrum Graff (Harrison Ford) and Maj. Gwen Anderson (Viola Davis) who recruit the young Napoleon to the International Military. The result is a rushed introduction that removes much thats humanizing or sympathetic leaving us with taciturn kids marching to taciturn adult orders.Granted director Gavin Hood (X-Men Origins Wolverine) has a lot to plow through here to satiate book devotees and get Ender to Battle School where children are trained to be cold remote pilots.And whatever your feelings about Cards public anti gay-marriage statements its clear why the book resonated -- and could have been a prescient film paralleling a world of smartphones and drone aircraft.But where the novels allowed readers to imagine adolescents morphing into killer soldiers its a tougher task on film where our characters exhibit about as much menace as facial hair. Theyre too old to be playing Potter-like magic games and too young to reckon with the sexual tension that underscores Twilight and Hunger Games.Instead we get 12-year-olds threatening one another like theyre Shawshank inmates and a shower assault scene that not only looks unconvincing; its kind of weird.Certainly no outer space film wanted to be the first to follow Gravity the picture that remains in theaters and has become such a public sensation that SNL is doing skits about it. While the zero-gravity scenes are accomplished in Enders they still leave the movie looking like an echo to the sci-fi shot heard round Hollywood.Most Enders fans of course wont care about comparisons and consider the film adaptation a long-awaited victory in itself.Those fresh to the tale -- or at least expecting something fresh from it -- may wonder what the fuss was about. 58 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 20 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1bId5BTHoliday Movies Calendar NovemberTake a look at the films heading to the box office this November complete with trailers reviews previews and more.

"Review Enders Game captures the now in its futuristic tale - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Enders Game captures the now in its futuristic tale Enders Game Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews Enders Game starring Asa Butterfield Harrison Ford Ben Kingsley and Viola Davis. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews Enders Game starring Asa Butterfield Harrison Ford Ben Kingsley and Viola Davis. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Orson Scott Cards science fiction novel ""Enders Game"" has been a touchstone for adolescent readers for nearly 30 years and watching this earnest respectful film version its easy to understand why.Its not just that the story of the rise of underappreciated misfit Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggin to a position of power and respect in the adult world is every bullied youngsters dream. Its the added notion that although those wretched adults need you that wont stop them from being two-faced devious and deceitful. Whoever said it was easy being young? Written and directed by Gavin Hood and starring Harrison Ford and young Asa Butterfield ""Enders Game"" gains a lot from the ability of its story to touch a nerve. A film for young people to which adults can eavesdrop if they are so inclined its not any more sophisticated than it needs to be. But its strong special effects make its simulated battles effective and echoing the book its story line touches on a number of intriguing issues.PHOTOS Fall movie sneaks 2013 Those battles are simulated because the animating notion of ""Enders Game"" is that sometime in the future children who think outside the box can be trained via computer simulations to take the lead in Earths coming battle to the death with a race of insects from another planet called Formics.""Enders Game"" opens 50 years after the last Formic invasion when the invading insects (known as ""buggers"" in the book but thankfully not on screen) were barely stopped from taking over Earth. Those in power on the planet including Mazer Rackham (Ben Kingsley with Maori tattoos on his face) have placed their hopes on youth in general and on Ender Wiggin in particular.While the hero of the novel ages from 6 to 12 the filmmakers have compressed the books narrative into one year and convincingly cast 16-year-old Butterfield last seen as the title character in Martin Scorseses ""Hugo"" as a roughly 12-year-old Ender.Despite the age difference the intense skinny actor is believable as the young misfit. Butterfield looks appropriately young and has the ability to convey Enders awkward nerdiness and ability to empathize with the enemy as well as the Bad Seed moments when his strategically employed but genuine fury gets the best of him. PHOTOS Hollywood backlot momentsThe third member of his family to be chosen for warfare preparations after his always-angry brother Peter (a role much reduced in importance from the book) and his empathetic sister Valentine (""Little Miss Sunshines"" Abigail Breslin) Ender often feels like the runt of the litter.He has a powerful ally however in Col. Hyrum Graff the commander of Battle School an orbiting space station where serious warrior training takes place.Played by Harrison Ford in the gruff taskmaster mode that feels a bit left over from ""42s"" Branch Rickey the Colonel believes Ender is the hoped-for leader and overrides the doubts of his sensitive colleague Maj. Gwen Anderson (Viola Davis). Convinced that all Ender needs is to be toughened up the Colonel places him in increasingly difficult situations and monitors the results.Ender who has no idea any of this is going on gets sent to Battle School as a ""Launchie"" or first-year cadet at the Colonels insistence. A bullying superior named Bonzo Madrid (Moises Arias) makes his life miserable but Ender also gains the friendship of Petra Arkanian (""True Grits"" Hailee Steinfeld).PHOTOS Scene from Enders Game and director Gavin Hood on battle scenesMuch of this is as pro forma as it sounds but the film adds an interesting wrinkle when it introduces an unnerving video game Ender plays that incorporates elements of his own psyche into the proceedings. An eventual meeting with Rackham the hero of the previous Formic war leads to the twists that have made the books reputation.Writer-director Hood whose films range from the Oscar-winning ""Tsotsi"" in his native South Africa to the blockbuster ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" tends to make movies that like this one do without nuanced emotions. But ""Enders Game"" has a few ways to counterbalance that.Unusual in that it is co-produced by major effects house Digital Domain ""Enders Game"" is invariably worth looking at. Production designed by Sean Haworth and Ben Proctor the film does well at depicting the action in the zero-gravity Battle Room as well as the grander computer warfare simulations that Ender orchestrates (very much like a conductor would lead a symphony) as his training progresses.It also helps that Cards 1985 novel was prescient about issues that still trouble us. Not only are video games considerably more sophisticated today making the storys key premise that much more plausible but issues of drone warfare preemptive strikes and the morality of child soldiers are on societys mind more than ever. ""Enders Game"" turns out to be our game as well.kenneth.turanlatimes.com----------------------------------Enders GameMPAA rating PG-13 for some violence science-fiction action and thematic materialRunning time 1 hour 54 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Science Fiction (Movie Genre) Reviews Enders Game premiere in Los Angeles Enders Game to top Free Birds Last Vegas at box office Enders Game director Gavin Hood on why he changed Enders age Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad73deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-enders-game-20131101,0,456434.story#axzz2jEyeTTsa",200,ender'sgame18,ender'sgame,latimes
"Enders Game | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; ender-s-game ) Enders Game (United States 2013) October 31 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Enders Game long a staple of science fiction readers has had a strange winding trip to the silver screen. For many years Orson Scott Card refused to sell the rights to the book wanting to maintain control over the final product. This iteration the result of numerous screenplay rewrites (several of which were authored by Card) has the authors blessing. He is listed as a producer and is the uncredited writing co-collaborator to director Gavin Hood. Fans of the novel will understand that a sub-two hour running time necessitated numerous changes and the inherent difficulties of working with young children forced changes in characters ages. However the movie Enders Game is recognizable in tone thematic content and narrative progression as Cards vision. It has been developed as a stand-alone project with the potential for additional chapters thereby giving it the potential to satisfy regardless of whether the box office take warrants a sequel. Enders Game starts with a familiar sci-fi trope the alien invasion. Some 50 years before the movies first present-day scene Earth became Ground Zero for an attack from the space by giant ant-like creatures called ""Formics."" They came they saw and they would have conquered if not for a daring move by war hero Mazer Rackham (Ben Kingsley). The Formic were beaten but not destroyed and the population of Earth lives in fear of their return. So over the past five decades the military has developed a training program whereby the best and the brightest children are put through rigorous training. Weapons were developed and leaders honed in the hope that when it comes time for the final confrontation with the Formic Earth will be ready. Into that cauldron comes Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) the third child of a family in a society that limits most families to two offspring. Military leaders see much potential in Ender to be the next great battle commander the heir to Mazer Rackhams legacy. But can Ender pass through the furnace and emerge fully forged or will the experience melt and break him? Enders Game is uneven - at times almost maddeningly so - with the first half offering more enjoyment than the second. Perhaps thats because in military-style movies I often prefer the training segments to the battle sequences. For most of its first half Enders Game does a nice job of developing the main character and illustrating the sharpness and creativity that makes him a prized pupil of Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford). Ender doesnt just win; he dominates. During the second half however character development takes a back seat to narrative thrust. The movie speeds up and becomes almost clumsy in the way it rushes through things. The ""epilogue"" is an example of this - a significant incident reduced to an afterthought. The big battle while maintaining its surprise element works much better in the book than on the screen. Because of the way its established theres an element of anticlimax to the entire thing. Outside of Ender and Graff there arent many people who could rightfully be called ""characters."" Ben Kingsley plays veteran hero Mazer Rackham but hes not given much more to do than look tough never smile and speak his dialogue using what appears to be a hybrid cockney/New Zealand accent. Abigail Breslin plays Enders sister Valentine who is the embodiment of compassion. Hailee Steinfeld more at home here than as Juliet is Petra Arakanian Enders friend and quasi-love interest. The romance is kept very low key since its not found anywhere in the source material. Finally double Oscar nominee Viola Davis gets to stand around looking sharp in her military attire while contributing little else. The films biggest star is Harrison Ford and his take on Graff (who would have been more appropriately named Gruff) is akin to what might expect from a war-weary Han Solo who has lost his capacity for wisecracking. At least this is a better role for Ford than Paranoia. Meanwhile his young co-star Asa Butterfield capably holds his own adding his solid and believable performance here to an equally solid and believable performance in Martin Scorseses Hugo. The central themes of Cards book remain intact chief of which relate to the ethics of defensive genocide. There are no easy answers to the questions posed by this issue and Enders Game to its credit doesnt try to provide Hollywood-style facile resolutions. The movie never gets as dark as it might but neither does it ignore the implications. Theres also an interesting side question about whether we act the same way during a simulation (when we know its artificial) as in a real-life situation. When a commander knows his decisions have genuine life-and-death implications does he issue orders with the same detachment as when hes playing a ""game?"" Enders Game is visually delightful at times bordering on spectacular. (And its not in 3-D) The space battles have a scope and energy to them. Equally impressive is the spherical battle room where teams compete in a futuristic zero-G version of paintball. Whatever flaws Enders Game may possess in terms of pacing its never less than stunning to look at which makes the IMAX version the preferred format. Perhaps the most refreshing thing about Enders Game is that its about something. Too many science fiction films (Im thinking about Star Trek into Darkness among others) have become so obsessed with action that theyve lost track of some of the basic tenets of the genre. Enders Game manages to be exciting and engaging while conveying weighty ideas. Its nowhere as complex and involving as Cards novel but for those who prefer a little more meat on their sci-fi bones this is an appetizing entrA(c)e.

Photo Everett Collection MORE FROM Sara Stewart Into the Forest is an all too believable apocalypse You can bank on Equity Stranger Things is filled with 80s nostalgia-bait New Ice Age may induce you to hibernate Ab Fab The Movie earns its name sweetie darling MOVIE REVIEW Enders Game He shoots he scores. Running time 114 minutes. Rated PG-13 (some violence disturbing images). At the E-Walk 34th St. others. When aliens come gunning for us who better to devise a counterattack than kids whove spent their whole lives tethered to the Xbox? Thats the tween-minded fantasy of ""Enders Game"" a big dark film that should satisfy the many fans of the Orson Scott Card novel and engage newcomers too. In the near future 12-year-old Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield of ""Hugo"") is one of the elite child geniuses groomed to be warriors in a world thats spent decades recovering from an attack by an ant-like race of aliens called Formics. Director Gavin Hood lets you know right away that this aint camp like ""The Last Starfighter""; in an early scene Enders implanted head monitor is removed messily as he shrieks. Enders been targeted as leadership material by the programs commander Colonel Hyrum Graff played with weary gravitas by Harrison Ford. Its good to see Ford in space mode again if tough to imagine him as a gaming expert -- his character seems more the type to growl terms like ""newfangled."" But command the little geniuses he does with the help of Viola Davis Major Gwen Anderson who doesnt have a lot to do beyond furrowing her brow and saying ""That wasnt in the original simulation."" After a brief glance at Enders family -- in particular his close relationship with sister Valentine (Abigail Breslin) -- we get to the meat of the story as the recruits are rocket-blasted to Battle School. The space-based boot camp sees teams of kids pitted against one another in an enormous anti-gravity arena where they float around strategize and fire freeze rays at one another. It all looks highly fun except the part where Ender gets bullied Hes egregiously praised by Graff in front of the others so hell be forced to develop his skills as a singular leader (""We need a Julius Caesar a Napoleon"" Graff says before its pointed out that neither of those guys ended up all that well). Hood (""X-Men Origins Wolverine"") goes all out with the Battle Room and with the eventual war simulations Ender will command like a diminutive conductor. His spectacular 2-D visuals have a crispness and depth that ironically seems absent from many 3-D films. One triumphant scene in which Ender has a ""Matrix""-like moment of realizing his potential as a fighter has an almost ballet-like quality. On top of that the young Butterfield gives ""Ender"" depth beyond its video-game setup (something you could be forgiven for doubting if youve seen the underwhelming action-centric trailers). As he learns the art of command and cooperation -- and increasingly starts to second-guess the mission -- Ender evolves before our eyes into a true leader. With his wide-set eyes and unflappable gravity punctuated by subtle moments of wry humor the kids a magnetic screen presence. Theres scant time for other character development a shame in the case of Ben Kingsleys face-tattooed Maori war hero Mazer Rackham. He dispenses a bit of twinkly eyed advice then fades into the pantheon of adults who stand on the sidelines watching the kids fight their battles. Likewise neither Hailee Steinfeld as Enders friend Petra and Moises Arias (""Kings of Summer"") as his nemesis Bonzo are given enough screen time to really stand out. The film loses its way a bit in the home stretch; a climactic battle never really feels urgent enough and the final sequence is shameless sequel-bait. ""Enders Game"" is at its best when showcasing the evolution of Enders moral and strategic education. I bore in mind the controversy over author Cards anti-gay stance which stirred up boycott calls -- but theres nothing of it here. Theres a reason the novel has been such a universal favorite since its release in 1985 Its examination of our bellicose culture and the wisdom of youth makes it a timeless story regardless of your political views. Plus its kinda nice to see a boy at the heart of one of these dystopian sagas for a change.

"Enders Game and About Time -- Dad can I borrow the space ship? Reviews | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesEnders Game and About Time -- Dad can I borrow the space ship? ReviewsTwo unusual sci-fi movies opening in Toronto theatres Friday deal with the daddy issue. When Tim played by Domhnall Gleeson turns 21 his dad (Bill Nighy) reveals a family secret. Asa Butterfield left gets a little backup from Harrison Ford in Enders Game.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Oct. 31 2013Enders GameStarring Asa Butterfield Hailee Steinfeld Harrison Ford Ben Kingsley and Viola Davis. Directed by Gavin Hood. Opens Nov. 1 at GTA theatres. 113 minutes. PGAbout TimeArticle Continued BelowStarring Domhnall Gleeson Rachel McAdams and Bill Nighy. Written and directed by Richard Curtis. Opens Nov. 1 at GTA theatres. 123 minutes. 14ANo matter whether youre saving the planet or just trying to figure out your own timeline daddy issues must always be dealt with.Thats the subtext of two unusual sci-fi movies opening in Toronto theatres Friday Enders Game and About Time. The former is a franchise wannabe about a brainy preteen boy who is snatched from his parents and conscripted into saving Earth from invading giant alien bugs. The latter is a quirky time-travel story about a son getting to know his father and himself by bending the rules of the clock.Enders Game written and directed by Gavin Hood (X-Men Origins Wolverine) is based on the popular 1985 young adult sci-fi novel (and subsequent series) by Orson Scott Card the Mormon author who has come under fire for his outspoken statements about homosexuality.It stars Hugos Asa Butterfield (Hugo) as the title Ender a brilliant yet aggressive 12-year-old plucked from his family on Earth to train in space in an elite academy for like-minded kids. Hes always been the odd kid out being the third child in a future society that mandates two per household. His father and two brothers have already fought and failed in the long struggle against the invading insects known as Formics making Ender the last hope of both his kin and his planet. Hes shipped off to Battle School an orbiting training facility sort of like Hogwarts Academy but with ray guns instead of wands.Enders youth and advanced video-game skills are prized by Earths military elders played by Harrison Ford Ben Kingsley and Viola Davis. Fords Colonel Hyrum Graff thinks Elder can be trained to lead the squashing of the bugs because the child is a warrior ""the enemy would never expect."" Neither would most moviegoers it must be said but the young cast (which also includes True Grits Hailee Steinfeld) acquits itself well. Butterfield seems almost laughable at first and the scenario brings uncomfortable reminders of real-life child soldiers.But the kid has an air of authority about him much like a younger Christian Bale or Benedict Cumberbatch and it doesnt take much to buy into the premise especially once the not-bad CGI revs up and Ender and his pint-sized pals start their tiny engines. But can Ender stay true to himself while proving to his father (and other daddy figures) that hes the boy-man to get the job done?Perhaps most surprising is how convincing the adults are. Ford Kingsley and Davis are all seriously engaged with this otherwise generic material especially Ford who often seems bored by his movie choices. He and the other adults arent above working with younger actors especially when it may lead to a lucrative franchise as is the obvious intention here.About Time isnt nearly so frantic. In fact its downright lackadaisical in its approach to time travel which normally involves the use of a nifty machine or some rift in the cosmos to achieve.Not so in the family of earnest Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) whose male members possess the magical skill of being able to travel through time. Tim doesnt know about this until his 21st birthday whereupon his father (Bill Nighy) casually imparts the information with somewhat less gravity than a dad would muster while handing his son the keys to a prized sports car.The family time-shifters dont have to do much more than simply close their eyes and concentrate (""A bit of a stumble and tumble and a rumble"" Dad calls it). Tim is soon merrily doing the parlour tricks that make up much of the movie which include redoing sexual encounters over and over until you get them just right.There are a few tricky rules to this time travel business of course which will complicate Tims relationship with Mary (Rachel McAdams) the girl whom hes been awkwardly courting.The sci-fi angle is really just a gimmick to give writer/director Richard Curtis another life-affirming rom-com one that reminds us of the fleeting nature of time and the importance of professing love to those who matter to us especially shy and eccentric dads.At just over two hours the film runs too long. It likely wont top the box office of such previous Curtis enchantments as Love Actually and Four Weddings and a Funeral but like most soppy encounters itll do.And any movie is improved by the presence of Bill Nighy who is at his dotty best here along with such supporting lights as Withnail amp; I duo Richard E. Grant and Richard Griffiths who make their last-ever screen appearance together in a delightful cameo appearance.The great Griffiths died earlier this year so this stands as his final film. The thought could bring a tear to a glass eye an experience that could be relived over and over accordingly to the whimsical rules of About Time.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

At the Critics Academy the fleet commander gave us a warning Never send a man to do a boys job.I freely admit that I havent played a video game since I was a teenager and that the game was ""Pong."" In the several decades since then Ive been more puzzled than offended by the drift toward violent video games. With so many imaginative worlds to choose from why do kids keep picking the ones where they obliterate invaders? When the dominant worldview in popular culture is conflictual the armed forces couldnt ask for a better breeding ground than a so-called PlayStation.In the near-future world of ""Enders Game"" video tablets are a recruiting tool for the army. With the planet under threat from an insectoid race called the Formics who lost a battle 50 years earlier and are massing for another attack the leaders of this vaguely imagined Earth turn to teenage gamers for help. The most skillful combatants are recruited by the gruff Col. Graff (Harrison Ford in monotonous-barking mode). At his side is psychologically attuned Major Anderson (Viola Davis) the compassionate yin to Graffs vengeful yang.Graff and Anderson agree that the Chosen One (yawn) could be Ender Wiggin a bullied boy who is slow to anger but willing to finish a foe when provoked. ""Enders Game"" based on a book by Orson Scott Card is full of such middle-ground malarkey. Ender gets sent into space and trained with a multicultural crew of rookies (including Hailee Steinfeld as a platonic pal) in a zero-gravity laser-tag arena. The presence of Ford and of Ben Kinglsey as a face-tattooed Yoda is supposed to give this boot-camp boilerplate a sci-fi pedigree but some of the schematic ideas about focusing the Force make ""Star Wars"" seem as layered as ""Ulysses."" Directed by Gavin Hood the South African who won a foreign-film Oscar for the tough-minded ""Tsotsi"" before going Hollywood ""Enders Game"" is a blandly sanitized spectacle. Ender spends half his time playing tablet-based video games and the other half floating through training exercises that are based on them. While the images are as sharp as your neighbors new hi-def TV the line between real and simulated destruction is as blurry as your nephews conscience. So its a cheat when Ender decides that the Formics weve barely seen are not so different from humans after all.""Enders Game"" is part of a book series so it could take several sequels for the teen hero to unlearn the reflexive violence that the products themselves are promoting. That would be like having your angry birds and eating them too.What ""Enders Game""  Two stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 154  Content Some violence and action Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Also starring Jennifer Garner. (Photo/Video Focus Features) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Oct. 31 2013 150 p.m. ET Matthew McConaughey continues to amaze. Last year he was dazzling as a nightclub owner (named Dallas) in ""Magic Mike."" Earlier this year he was zestful and graceful in ""Mud."" Now in ""Dallas Buyers Club"" hes extravagantly funny and deeply affecting as Ron Woodroof a dissolute homophobic Texas electrician and sometime cowboy diagnosed as HIV-positive in 1985. That diagnosis at that time amounts to a death sentence. But Ron gives himself and other desperate sufferers a new lease on life by searching out alternative treatments--alternative to almost nothing since the government and Big Pharma have barely begun a response to the AIDS plague. Then reinventing himself as an entrepreneur in the AIDS underground he sets up a club that allows members to buy drugs he has smuggled into the U.S. from Mexico and farther-flung sources. This classic tale of a little guy taking on giants benefits from being essentially true and from accomplished filmmaking but most of all from the beautiful vitality of Mr. McConaugheys performance. WSJ Film Critic Joe Morgenstern reviews Dallas Buyers Club and lauds Matthew McConaughey for another dazzling performance. It isnt clear how Ron contracted the disease and the stages he goes through cant be found in Kubler-Ross except for a brief and lusty period of denial when a doctor tells him hes got 30 days to put his affairs in order. ""Heres a news flash"" the emaciated patient bellows. ""There aint nothin out there that can kill Ron Woodroof in 30 days."" This also proves to be true; the real-life Ron outlived his sentence by seven years. The lively surprising script by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack goes through occasional stages of schematic drama--shades of "" Erin Brockovich""--that make Rons adversaries more rigid than they may have been. And its vague on the subject of how effective his clubs drugs really are. For the most part though the writing is equal and then some to the quicksilver quality of its heros personality. Ron doesnt decide to join the gay community. He simply moves in by barely perceptible degrees. In the same way he loathes then loathes less then accepts as a business partner then cares for and finally loves a transvestite Rayon (superb work by Jared Leto) whom he first encounters when theyre hospital roommates. Gaining or Losing Weight for a Role Matthew McConaughey lost 47 lbs. for his role in ""Dallas Buyers Club."" A look at other actors who lost or gained poundage for their roles. Tom Hanks in Philadelphia TriStar PicturesPhotofest ""Dallas Buyers Club"" which was directed with flair and fluency by Jean-Marc Vallee is a showcase of fine performances some of them notable for their restraint. Jennifer Garners Eve Rons mainstream doctor is a compassionate woman who says more with her eyes than with her mouth. She is also a partially written woman with no noticeable life outside her profession but youd never know it from the warmth of Ms. Garners portrayal. Griffin Dunne is quietly grounded and intriguingly complex as Dr. Vass a defrocked American doctor running a scruffy clinic in Mexico. The cast includes Denis OHare Steve Zahn Michael ONeill and Dallas Roberts. At the center of the showcase Mr. McConaughey manages to be hugely entertaining and improbably heroic often at the same time. Driving through a U.S. border checkpoint with a trunkful of unregulated drugs from his Mexican connection Ron passes himself off as a priest. Returning from a drug buy in Japan he pretends to be a doctor. (These escapades are based on fact.) ""Do you ever wear any colors?"" he asks Eve who usually doesnt. He does--every color of the emotional rainbow from deep despair in the face of death to incandescent delight at being alive. Watch a clip from the documentary film ""The Square."" A group of Egyptian revolutionaries battle leaders and regimes risking their lives to build a new society of conscience. (Photo/Video Participant Media) The Square With the anguish of hindsight ""The Square"" is more than a microcosmic account of the events that have convulsed Egypt in the past couple of years. Jehane Noujaims stirring documentary focused on the demonstrations and protests in Cairos Tahrir Square is a chronicle of blasted hope and a demonstration in its own right of why the popular revolution against 30 years of Hosni Mubaraks rule was unable to prevail after Mubarak was driven from office. The film starts in February 2011 when protests fill Tahrir Square. Energized by their own courage in the face of a brutal police crackdown the demonstrators are seized by a kind of ecstasy. An Islamist identified only as Magdy declares ""We are one society."" A young firebrand Ahmed embraces a fellow protester. ""I am telling you good things are coming"" he says. ""Good things Thank God"" ENLARGE Egyptian activists Khalid Abdalla left and Ahmed Hassan in Jehane Noujaims documentary ""The Square."" Noujaim Films Magdy and Ahmed are the narratives protagonists friends whose shared dreams and divergent beliefs reflect those of their turbulent nation. Ahmed a secular Muslim in his mid-20s is a prodigy of eloquence and optimism. Magdy a father of four in his mid-40s is less articulate but no less joyous when President Mubarak suddenly steps down; Magdy had been abducted and tortured by the Mubarak regime for his membership in the Muslim Brotherhood. This structure may be simplistic but it serves the film well by personalizing the revolutions basic conflict. When good things fail to materialize and the military remains in charge long after Mubaraks removal Ahmed suspects that the Muslim Brotherhood has been using the demonstrations to hijack the movement while Magdy distances himself from the protests in obedience to Brotherhood orders. Ms. Noujaims sympathies are clearly secular. In the run-up to the elections that brought the Brotherhood to political power her film depicts a nation faced with bad alternatives--the Muslim Brotherhood or continued military rule. ""There are no decent political parties"" says Khalid Abdalla who also figures prominently in the narrative; hes the British-Egyptian actor who starred in ""The Kite Runner"" and who served as a media-wise spokesman for the uprising. Still ""The Square"" stands as a valuable document of a tormented time an anatomy of a revolutionary movement doomed by a paucity of viable institutions and by the movements failure to advance a coherent agenda. (Its all the more heartbreaking when a speaker at one of the protests cries fervently ""We will fill the world with poetry."") In the bitter aftermath of the elections and the militarys subsequent ouster of the Islamist government headed by Mohamed Morsi Magdy is bereft a man torn between country and party while Ahmed has regained some of the buoyancy he lost when the Islamists took power. ""The people"" he insists ""will continue to pull rulers out of power until we reclaim our rights and rebuild the country ourselves."" It would seem a wistful dream in the present circumstances but a dream that is shared by Mr. Abdalla the actor and ardent activist. ""I think whats happening is more powerful than any one individual or organization"" he says. ""Its something fundamental inside people that is moving them. I dont know how you kill that."" Watch a clip from the film ""Enders Game."" Young Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) is recruited and trained to lead soldiers into a battle that will determine the future of Earth. Also starring Harrison Ford. (Photo/Video Summit Entertainment) Enders Game Who could have guessed that ""Gravity"" would be topped--or bottomed--so soon after its release? Not only does ""Enders Game"" have many scenes in zero gravity but this zero-sum fiasco has zero drama zero suspense zero humor zero charm and zero appeal. It is however a genuine mystery--an expensive-looking sci-fi adventure rated PG-13 and aimed at younger audiences in which nothing of any consequence happens until the last few minutes when the plot takes a foolish twist and the film turns into a muddled polemic about the immorality of preventive wars. ENLARGE Left to right Ben Kingsley and Asa Butterfield in Enders Game. Summit Entertainment ""Enders Game"" was directed by Gavin Hood who adapted the screenplay from the Orson Scott Card novel. In the original source material government leaders breed child geniuses then give them military training as Earths best hope of defending itself against a recurrent threat of alien invasion. The cream of the movies crop Ender Wiggin is played by Asa Butterfield who was the blank-faced boy of the title in Martin Scorseses ""Hugo."" His face isnt as inexpressive as it was but his character is insufferably manipulative and generally dislikable and thats only the beginning of the movies woes. For one thing Ender doesnt seem all that brilliant despite his superiors belief that he like Keanu Reevess blank-faced Neo in ""The Matrix"" is The One. (The commander in charge of his training is played by Harrison Ford who infuses the role with whats become his patented gloom; the actors theme song should be ""Bring In the Frowns."") For another the geniuses who made this soulless spectacle have mistaken training in which little is at stake for genuine action. After Ender and his classmates go into training they go into another phase of training which is followed by more training for further levels of training through war-game simulations all of it as involving as the video-game abstractions of ""Speed Racer."" The games in zero gravity are meant to evoke Quidditch and Harry Potter but I kept thinking of splurge guns and Bugsy Malone. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE Mud (2013) Matthew McConaughey plays a charismatic drifter named Mud in Jeff Nicholss third feature which abounds in surprise unadorned beauty and unforced wisdom. Muds charisma lies in the wide eyes of his beholders a couple of 14-year-olds who come upon him hiding out from the law on a little island in the Mississippi River; his literal hideout is an abandoned boat nestled high in the branches of a tree where it was deposited by a flood. The movie belongs to the teenage buddies as much as to the title character and echoes of Mark Twain arent accidental. ENLARGE Control Room (2004) Jehane Noujaims documentary should be essential viewing for people who want to expand their understanding of how the U.S. has been seen in the Arab world. The film is an admittedly sympathetic appraisal of al-Jazeera the Qatar-based satellite channel during the second Iraq war. News management is the issue. ""Control Room"" shows how coverage is tailored to fit the audience both by al-Jazeera and its Western counterparts. Ms. Noujaims documentary neither justifies nor condemns this but lets us judge al-Jazeeras clearly partisan approach against the sanitized--and partisan--coverage on American television. ENLARGE Starship Troopers (1997) Heres a case of sci-fi training that leads swiftly to action when eager bright-eyed earthlings take on the arachnid hordes in Paul Verhoevens film based on Robert A. Heinleins angry militaristic novel of the same name. Our doughboys and doughgirls have gone through rigorous training but nothing could have prepared them for a planet crawling with thousands of giant bugs. Nothing prepared me for the films bold initially ironic stance toward using kids as cannon fodder. Yet the action eventually obliterates any traces of irony in this vast elegantly executed enterprise.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Asa Butterfield has a simmering presence in the title role of ""Enders Game"" and Harrison Ford is generally gruff as Col. Graff. (AP) By Michael OSullivan October 31 2013 Theres a moral heft to ""Enders Game"" that lends ballast to the science-fiction adventure about futuristic military-academy cadets. Based on the popular and award-winning 1985 novel by Orson Scott Card the film doesnt need added suspense bigger action or a better dramatic twist; its got all of those in more than serviceable amounts. But it benefits greatly at least for those who care about such things by actually being about something -- the morality of war and its methods -- in a way that most movies of this type are not. ""Wait a minute"" my 14-year-old son protested as we were chatting on the way home from the screening. "" Pacific Rim was about something too."" Thats right I admitted. It was about robots fighting monsters. (It was also about 20 minutes too long.) Other than that I pointed out there was not much ""there"" there. As someone who is perfectly content to have his adrenal gland stimulated instead of his brain my son and his adolescent cohort are a large part of the films target demographic. This is somewhat ironic considering that the films hero is a teenage whiz kid being groomed to lead a fighting force of similarly brilliant highly trained children against a race of buglike aliens. Asa Butterfield plays the 15-year-old Ender Wiggin a student soldier training to fight the Formics (or Buggers as they are known) who 50 years before the action of the film attacked Earth killing millions before being driven back to their home planet. Why children? Basically they can multitask. Because of their youth as the film explains these military prodigies can assimilate complex battle information and devise effective attack strategies more quickly and easily than adults. This is thanks to the same wiring that makes them so good at video games. And yes gaming figures prominently here. Several scenes feature a high-tech version of laser tag played in a weightless arena. Its actually kind of cool. Others show Ender playing a video game on an iPad-like device that he controls with his mind. These sequences will probably be of less interest to viewers old enough to have mortgages than to those with enough free time to spend 20 hours a week playing ""Call of Duty."" Be that as it may the gaming scenes -- and the way they illuminate Enders fiercely competitive streak -- are critical to the story which moves along briskly. Central to its narrative is this Ender is not just a brainiac; he also doesnt like to lose. In fact his nickname explained in the book as originating from a childhood mispronunciation of Andrew is a convenient description of his combat MO. Ender doesnt just want to win whatever battle hes currently fighting; he wants to end all future battles that might come his way. This old -- and highly debatable -- notion of the war to end all wars of course is precisely what the film grapples with with surprising depth. In addition to the climactic battle its a theme that comes up a couple of times in Enders tangles with bullies where he goes way too far in his attempt to forestall future attacks. Its precisely that killer instinct the film tells us and not merely Enders leadership abilities that make him teachers pet. One note There are a couple of deaths in the book that have been softened for the film. That seems a little chicken-hearted of writer-director Gavin Hood (""X-Men Origins Wolverine""). His audience can take it and it would have made for a better and tougher film. As Enders gruff mentor Col. Graff Harrison Ford is a bit one-note though the role doesnt call for much more than barking and scowling. Butterfield is pretty great though. Although scrawny the actor has a piercing intensity last seen in ""Hugo"" and deepening with adolescence that makes you believe he really could finish you if pushed too far. Moises Arias a performer whos usually known for playing goofballs also makes a surprising and powerful impression as the bully Bonzo. But ""Enders Game"" is more than a parable about bullying or a disquisition on the concept of the ""just war."" Its also a rousing action film especially in Imax. You may come for the candy coating but youll ruminate on the chewy nougat filling all the way home.    PG-13. At area theaters. Contains sci-fi action and violence. 114 minutes. goingoutguide true Please provide a valid email address.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Kicking off with a full-scale alien attack on Earth the science-fiction boys adventure ""Enders Game"" throws everything in the whiz-bang arsenal at us. Theres a satellite martial academy where child warriors train in free-floating combat. There are battles between interstellar fleets that litter the screen with more space shrapnel than a dozen ""Gravity""s. In the end we even get to see an entire planet disintegrate. And yet all the spectacle never works up your emotions. Many sci-fi fans swear by the greatness of Orson Scott Cards 1985 bestseller but this film adaptation aspiring to high seriousness is merely glum. The film plays like a dark solemn junior-high version of ""Starship Troopers"" and it leaves you bored senseless. The film is set 50 years after a catastrophic battle with an insectoid alien race put Earth on permanent (and totalitarian-tinged) military alert. Asa Butterfield (""Hugo"") plays gangly soft-featured Ender a star student in the military school that prepares kids to lead a counterattack against the ant-like Formics. His older siblings didnt qualify for the prestigious program. Sis (Abagail Breslin) was too empathetic and brother (Jimmy Jax Pinchak) had an overdeveloped killer instinct. In Ender the mix is just right. Hes sensitive enough to understand the enemy and ruthless enough to use that intuition to defeat them. Plus hes a whiz at computer combat games. J.K. Rowlings Harry Potter series was published years after Cards ""Ender"" but it came to the screen first with many similar scenes and parallel situations. Theres a sense of deja vu as were marched through the off-Earth boarding school where the students divide into rival squadrons and compete in Quidditch-like flying shootouts. They play so many rounds of float-and-zap that the first hour of the film feels like a laser tag documentary. The futuristic visual cues lifted from ""Avatar"" ""Independence Day"" and ""Star Wars"" are too numerous to mention. Theres even Harrison Ford doing his gruff thing as the battle schools growly headmaster. Where those earlier films sizzled with invention and gloried in the old tropes they borrowed ""Enders Game"" drowns in its somber undercurrents. The hazing Ender endures has a sour cruel edge and his aggressively violent retaliation is off-putting. The story eventually arrives at an antibullying moral but it takes a harsh path to get there. As Ender himself puts it before his change of heart ""Follow the rules you lose. Choose violence you win."" When Ben Kingsley appears with Darth Maul/Maori face tattoos and a zany New Zealand accent he gives the film a sudden lift. Playing the fighter pilot who defeated the first wave of alien invaders he brings a spot of high style to the movie his voice commandingly intense. ENDERS GAME 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for some violence sci-fi action and thematic material. But this new mentor arrives too late to save the films flagging momentum. The films other true acting sparkplug is Moises Arias as a rival youth commander determined to make Enders life hell. Strutting like a power-mad Junior ROTC officer he gooses every scene he appears in and there are too few before hes abruptly written out. Writer/director Gavin Hood (""X-Men Origins Wolverine"") doesnt condescend to the material in this young-adult space melodrama but he never gets a dramatic grip on it either. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

"Enders Game 3 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Enders Game 3 stars Enders Game delivers lots of action but lacks depth development found in book A screenshot from the first trailer for ""Enders Game.""Summit Entertainment SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED VIDEO Enders Game trailer By Kerry Lengel The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Oct 31 2013 1117 AM What ""Enders Game"" really needs is a good old-fashioned montage. No thats not the only thing missing in this long-anticipated film adaptation of the popular sci-fi novel by Orson Scott Card. Character development dramatic tension and emotional resonance all get short shrift in the checklist exposition by writer-director Gavin Hood. And there seems to have been coffee shortage on set too judging from the barely there performance by Harrison Ford as a gruff commander named Graff. But a montage or two no matter how hackneyed the technique would go a long way toward capturing some of the grueling detail in a story about a child prodigy recruited to an orbiting military academy bullied by his peers and forced to run a gauntlet of dangerous tests all in order to shape him into the greatest battle tactician in history and save humanity from a race of giant insects. ""Hugo"" actor Asa Butterfield 16 but looking more like 12 stars as the title character Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggin. We first meet the young genius at school where a computerized monitor implanted in the back of his neck records every interaction for scrutiny by Col. Graff on behalf of the International Fleet. The first of many dangerous tests comes when the monitor is removed and Ender has to face up to the class bully which he does with devastating effect. He didnt just want to win that fight he explains he wanted to win the next one and the next. This is exactly what Graff wants to hear and soon Ender finds himself in a shuttle full of new recruits dubbed ""launchies"" on their way to space and the Battle School. There he must figure out how to deal with pubescent rivals envious to the point of violence not to mention the bellowing Sgt. Dap (Nonso Anozie whose comic relief is less than welcome). The curriculum for the cadets includes such necessaries as orbital mechanics but the heart of their training takes place in the Battle Room depicted onscreen as a giant sphere with zero gravity where the kids compete in miniature armies to learn three-dimensional tactics along with the skills they need. Hood does a fine job of envisioning the mechanics of these war games but what doesnt come across are the tactical insights Ender gains that are so crucial to the plot of the book nor -- and even more crucially -- the intense pressure he feels to win as he faces challenge after challenge with the deck intentionally stacked against him. Indeed a sense of real danger both physical and psychological is the most important element of the book that fails to translate through most of the film. This changes only when Enders education culminates in a series of simulated space battles that represent his final exam supervised by a wily half-Maori guru played by Sir Ben Kingsley complete with facial tattoos and a dead-on Kiwi accent. The climactic dance of digitally animated armadas is worthy of the Michael Bay school of mega spectacle and ends with a dramatic twist that may be telegraphed but is nevertheless effective. This is followed by a coda cleverly adapted to fit the movies condensed timeline that some are comparing to the never-ending endings of Steven Spielberg and ""The Lord of the Rings."" And it might feel that way to casual moviegoers looking for a sci-fi joyride but to those to know and love the book it might be the most thrilling moment of all.

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com ENDERS GAME Share Comment Ironically given Orson Scott Cards foolish and futile opposition to gay rights his 1985 YA sci-fi novel ""Enders Game"" not only preaches tolerance but has also given solace to countless gay kids and other outsiders struggling with loneliness and alienation. So the good his book has done helping kids cope has probably more than balanced any damage the author himself has done with his outspoken homophobia. With so much to work with it is disappointing that Gavin Hoods adaptation is not much more than the worlds coolest video game. This version of ""Enders Game"" lacks passion and pain. Acted without affect in settings that are as devoid of humanity as the space station in ""2001"" this game plays out with cold precision but little team spirit.

(Richard Foreman) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday October 31 2013 131 PM Title Enders Game zero stars Film Info PG-13 Violence. Area theaters. On the dark side of the moon where awful cult sci-fi and fantasy adaptations are buried theres a special cave for ""Enders Game."" This movie of a 1985 outer-space military allegory is one of the dullest dumbest most tedious movies this year. It makes ""Battlefield Earth"" and ""John Carter"" look like ""The Godfather"" parts 1 and 2. ""Dune"" is ""Lawrence of Arabia"" next to this thing. Audiences of all ages avoid it. Brain cells are too valuable. Ironically it is the brain of young A. E. ""Ender"" Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) that were told makes him special. In the future 50 years after Earth repelled an attack by the bug-like Formics Enders gifts make him The One sought by the International Fleet and gruff commander Graff (Harrison Ford shh dont wake him). The IF wants Ender to lead a new offensive against the Formics using troops of children. Raised on war games the youths are adept at strategy and technology. Ender endures endless training sessions where he faces down bullies and bonds with a tough girl (Hailee Steinfeld). He misses his pacifist sister (Abigail Breslin) on Earth but rises in the ranks. The IF though has manipulated Ender to be the pawn in a final showdown the kid doesnt see coming. The insipid uninteresting boot camp scenes go on and on  and contain an excitement about zero-gravity that would be quaint in a 70s live-action Disney movie. Moises Arias (l.) and Asa Butterfield face off (Hailee Steinfeld rear) in Enders Game. (Richard Foreman) As if this all wasnt just Wii-time cinema anyway -- so much conflict simulation so little conflict -- there are long stretches where Ender plays a mind-reading quest-and-test computer program. Lucky us we get to watch The adolescent actors horribly miscast as well as misdirected by Gavin Hood (who once made a Best Foreign Film winner but now makes genre junk like this and ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"") fare no better than the adults. Ford so great earlier this year in ""42"" is a piece of wood in a beret; Viola Davis sympathetic psychologist is all sad-eyed looks and Ben Kingsley has Maori face tattoos and an accent that suggest he teleported in from ""Iron Man 3."" Hoods script from Orson Scott Cards book is cut-rate ""Top Gun"" for tweens. A last complaint though this incompetent project inspires so many Its more exciting to watch a hero -- King Arthur Luke Skywalker the Last Starfighter whoever -- find greatness than to hear someone repeatedly called a savior or as here ""a Julius Caesar a Napoleon."" Hailee Steinfeld and Asa Butterfield embark on space training in Enders Game. (Richard Foreman) ""Enders Game"" the book may have a special place in pop-lit.

Much of the hoopla surrounding the release of ""Enders Game"" writer-director Gavin Hoods adaptation of Orson Scott Cards 1985 futuristic science fiction tome has revolved around the authors anti-gay sentiments. Whether or not his ideology comes through in the original text the imperialistic story of ""Enders Game"" celebrates libertarian extremism more than any form of close-minded religious values. Hoods snazzy engaging treatment capably delves into the plight of young soldier Ender Wiggin (""Hugo"" star Asa Butterfield) as hes recruited by the worlds fascistic armed forces for an intense outer space training program to combat the bug-like aliens that invaded Earth decades ago. Yet even while it has the tropes of young adult fiction and accurately portrays the scrawny Enders burgeoning ferocity ultimately it plays up his individualism to the point where he turns against the very system that trained him to fight. That makes it not only the most subversive blockbuster of the year (a sort of ""Starship Troopers Jr."" if you will) -- but also an elegant if unintentional allegory for the public narrative of Edward Snowden. The parallels with the original scenario are so cut and dried its a surprise that hardly anyone (save for this essay in The Cassandra Times that draws on the original book) has picked up on them Enterprising child prodigy is trained by global superpower to strengthen its cause discovers corruption within and flees to the other side for the greater good. Thats precisely the arc that Ender endures and that has defined perceptions of Snowdens actions in the press. Hoods movie works so well because it manages to inhabit Enders perspective of the opportunities surrounding him so that we discover the problematic nature of the worlds military efforts along with him. The narrative opens with Ender as a lonely adolescent constantly teased by bullies while repeatedly defeating them in military videogame competitions while the stern Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford putting little effort into the role as usual but at least utilized better than he has been in recent years) monitors Enders resolve on a remote monitor. Thats not the only parallel with NSA-level surveillance tactics; once brought onboard the armys training ship Ender protests when he discovers that hes unable to send e-mails. ""You have the right to privately think whatever you want"" the colonel tells Ender ""but theres too much at stake for your unfiltered thoughts to leave this ship."" His look of astonishment at this admission marks the first crucial step in his path to becoming an interstellar whistleblower. Surprisingly tense if strangely humorless ""Enders Game"" is certainly the best looking science fiction effort this side of ""Gravity"" and presents an extraordinarily detailed world but Hood manages to position its sleek beautiful elements in contrast to the darker themes at play. A wide-open chamber where the recruits practice zero gravity combat contains a sense of wonder that only goes so far; when the stun guns come out and the kids rejoice in the possibilities of temporarily paralyzing each other the mood is more somber and borderline creepy than awe-inspiring. The effects are similarly provocative in their depiction of the enemy which for much of the running time remains off-screen represented solely by a series of drab brown ships that the recruits learn about only by watching military-sanctioned videos of the attacks. This one-sided perspective of villainy certainly reeks of familiarity when considered in the context of Snowden Wikileaks and others responsible for rebelling against the ramifications of professed ""nationalistic"" agendas that dictate how the public sees the world. However the biggest piece of the equation that transforms ""Enders Game"" into the worlds first fictionalized treatment of the Edward Snowden story (lord knows well see more of them) revolves around the twist of its final act. Its here that spoilers are essential so if youd like to remain at least a little bit in the dark as to the plot of the movie youre better off bookmarking this article and returning to it after youve seen the thing this weekend. Enders chief talent that catches the eye of the colonel and his colleagues involves his gaming abilities. Rather than playing by the rules he constantly defies them by using various dirty tricks to cheat the system. This talent is epitomized during one fascinating sequence in which Ender plays a seemingly basic 3-D game on his futuristic iPad in which he takes on the role of a mouse forced by a menacing troll to choose between two goblets with the knowledge that one of them contains poison. After figuring out that both of them do he breaks with the games logic and kills the troll so he can proceed forward. The colonel watches with glee Heres a guy willing to defy the apparent limitations of any given by challenge by simply cutting to the chase. That mentality comes into play during the penultimate showdown in which Ender leads an allegedly simulated battle against the aliens home planet and manages to destroy the whole thing by using a military ship as bait. While thousands of soldiers are killed as the bugs assail the ship Ender and his crew get a clean shot at the core of the planet turning it into a fuming mess. Then comes the shocker This wasnt a simulation at all. Ender unwittingly allowed untold innocents to die and destroyed an entire race without realizing it. After expressing his horror Ender is told by the colonel that the boys ignorance was a necessary evil. ""We won"" Graff says. ""Thats all that matters."" Ender isnt convinced for a second. ""No"" he replies. ""The way we won is what matters."" That assertion leads to the movies remarkable climax on the scorched alien planet where Ender tracks down the dying queen of the alien race and discovers her caring for her unborn child. In the final shot he has agreed to smuggle the creature back to Earth and already started his voyage. Does Ender go to the dark side or fight the good fight? The semantics of the scenario make this movie a rather stunning alternative to some of the other ostensibly bleaker genre productions aimed at younger demographics of recent vintage particularly ""Twilight"" and ""The Hunger Games."" While both franchises deal with mature elements involving institutional problems and burgeoning adulthood ""Enders Game"" is a coherent missive against the perils of confidentiality and unless one wants to make the case that it depicts its hero with shades of moral ambiguity -- the triumphalist finale suggests otherwise -- the plot represents a clear-cut celebration of revolutionary spirit. It also raises a chicken and egg question Is it possible that Snowden himself was driven to action after reading Cards book?  Either way anyone in Moscow hoping to spot the exiled man of mystery out and about may want to keep an eye on the multiplex.

This article is hogwash. Reply Taylor May 12 2016 104 pm This is just grasping at straws. The problem with this article is that it ignores the essential fact that we know EVERYTHING about Enders world. We know every nuance of the inner workings of the government and war in this film. We also know everything about Ender and why he does what he does since were LITERALLY INSIDE HIS HEAD the entire time. As for the Snowden sagawe know very little. I believe we know far less than people think. We dont know why he did what he did or where his true allegiance lies only what he told us. We cant get inside his head. As for the US government all we know is what was in the released documents. We dont know what the decision making process was what happened to spark these reactions what the government was actually trying to do with the intel they were collecting or whether or not their decision was justified in the end. We know nothing about what happened with Snowden but everything about what happened with Ender. Acting like you can relate a situation where you know everything to one where you know maybe 1% of the truth is asinine. Reply JF May 12 2016 104 pm This is just asinine. Reply forrestgump May 12 2016 104 pm I guarantee that any reference to Edward Snowden by the Hollywood establishment is going to come with a cautionary warning about the dangers of challenging authority. Reply Mel May 12 2016 104 pm Hmmm.... He doesnt take it to Earth -- he goes to find it a new home. Reply winston May 12 2016 104 pm A laughable effort to extract meaning from a stone.

AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Late nights convention takes Who did it best? LIer preps for next Americas Got Talent Why are we seeing these images? Because the original 1985 ""Ender"" novel (revised/reissued in 1991) by Orson Scott Card has already spawned an entire series of books and now it has birthed the first of what is set up to be a fleet of motion pictures -- a slow-moving-to-the-point-of-narcosis fleet of motion pictures judging by the first. It boasts not only unconvincing actors floating dreamily through space but also a color palette that belongs in a hospital music that belongs in an elevator and production design that -- like a fireworks display -- is flashy bright and devoid of either context or intelligence. Young Asa Butterfield the cute kid from ""Hugo"" is now less cute and less than engaging as Ender Wiggin a Battle School wannabe who comes under the gaze of the austere Col. Hyrum Graff (Harrison Ford fulminating). Graff sees in the boy the kind of talent and/or sociopathy that can save mankind from what is sure to be a second attack by the Formics a race of insectoids that have already wreaked havoc on mankind. 153 MoviesEnders Game trailer The story of ""Enders Game"" involves Enders adjustment to being a prodigy a leader of men/women and the savior of his race. Its all setup to a sequel. None of it is convincing in the least. advertisement | advertise on newsday And even director Hood (""X-Men Origins Wolverine"") seems to let his own attention wander becoming fixated on the shiny objects that float about the space station sleepily dreamily and with no fixed destination.

"Enders Game movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Playing to save the world in Enders Game  1/2Another sci-fi book series with a young hero hits the big screenOctober 31 2013|Michael PhillipsAsa Butterfield and Harrison Ford star in ""Enders Game."" (Richard Foreman )In step with its sensitive tactically brilliant 12-year-old hero ""Enders Game"" is a bit of a tweener neither triumph nor disaster a war-games fantasy with a use-by date of Nov. 22 when the new ""Hunger Games"" movie comes out.Its central action scenes unfold in a vast zero-gravity battle-simulation arena on a space station readying for an alien attack of enormous skittery bugs called Formics. The preteens and young teenagers being trained to save the world play dangerous rounds of laser tag and try to impress the authority figures played by Harrison Ford (a long way from Han Solo) Viola Davis and Sir Ben Kingsley. Asa Butterfield of ""Hugo"" is Ender Wiggins the relentlessly bullied boy with the Hobbitty-sounding name who becomes ""Earths ultimate military leader"" in the words of the films promotional materials. Hailee Steinfeld of ""True Grit"" is Petra his sympathetic best friend and training mentor. Theyre sweet together these kids. Already Butterfield and Steinfeld are learning the virtue of behaving on camera as opposed to acting each tense encounter into the ground.When a best-seller such as Orson Scott Cards ""Enders Game"" takes a generation or more to find its way to the screen the result can acquire an unwanted aura of retro-nostalgia whatever the storys setting or the directors approach. The look of this project reflected by the films poster settles for futuristic industrialism made generic. Still while writer and director Gavin Hood may not be Mr. Style or a science-fiction visionary he gets the story told with appealing actors at the center.Across nearly three decades many young readers have devoured Cards books (the original the four sequels plus two spinoff adventures) as expressions of rebellious outsiders with a cause. Ender is a freak by definition simply by being a ""third"" the third-born child in a near-future world ruled by a strict two-child policy. The violence in Enders life is nearly always justified since hes dealing with dead-eyed sociopaths his own age who wish to do him harm. Then comes the not-so-twisty twist near the climax of the story which asks the audience to grieve and question a different scale of violence. (Spoiler issues here so well keep mum.)Hoods adaptation streamlines the novel and its concerns only occasionally lapsing into trailer-speak as when Fords commander speaks to his recruits in the language of movie-trailer-ese (""and in the middle of the battle a legendary hero emerged""). At heart ""Enders Game"" relays a simple story of a little guy caught in a web not of his own making learning to stand up for his beliefs. The target audience could do worse. The old folk meantime can focus on the films most intense stare-down contest Though I dont believe they ever share a scene its astonishing nonetheless how Kingsley and the main Formic handle close-ups in exactly the same way never ever ever ever blinking.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Enders Game is a tightly plotted un-bombastic sci-fi movie that has the bad luck of being a relatively faithful adaptation of a novel by Orson Scott Card. Though it cant overcome the source materials problematic themes--namely Cards intentionalist morality which prizes a characters ideals over their actions--or its all-too-convenient characterizations the film manages a sustained sense of momentum and tone that is rare for a contemporary big-budget movie. The less viewers think about the movies ideological underpinnings the more likely they are to enjoy its restrained performances and immersive science-fiction visuals. Set half a century after an attempted invasion of Earth Enders Game follows tactical wunderkind Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) as he is trained and manipulated by an international military coalition to become a commander in a hypothetical future conflict with the aliens. Though indebted to 2010s Tron Legacyin terms of sound design and imagery the movie avoids IMAX-ready centerpieces in favor of focusing on the complicated social maneuvering of Enders instructors and peers. The effects-driven sequences--the students mock war games--are efficient and purposeful. Back-corridor bargaining and bullying are emphasized which underlines the impression that this is essentially a high-school story--with Harrison Ford and Viola Davis as teachers trying to decide what to do with a gifted student--in futuristic military drag. Though its largely a virtue writer-director Gavin Hoods brisk pacing proves to be something of a liability during the movies climactic twist. Hood handles the scene without patronizing; the characters never bluntly state what happened inviting the audience to realize its implications alongside Ender. However because Hood proceeds to the next bit of plot as quickly as possible (accompanied as always by the arpeggiated chords walls of synth-brass and big loud drums of the score) he robs the scene of any emotional potency. Though Hood significantly compresses the source novels epilogue and simplifies its background politicking and violence he retains the central idea that makes Cards book so troublesome. Ender is portrayed as a tragic superman who possesses immense destructive power but can never be held accountable for his actions. He is a victim-hero who can do evil but remains morally unblemished because of his good intentions--a characterization that appeals to the closet fascist lurking inside every angry teenage boy.

Since it took 28 years to get it to the big screen the fact that the end result feels rushed and hasty probably qualifies as irony. Not in terms of production value mind you. Adapted and directed by Gavin Hood (""Tsotsi"" ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"") this ""Enders Game"" is about as slick a spectacle as fans could have hoped for blending futuristic wonderment with recognizable human behavior. The zero-gravity capture-the-flag games are convincing (and fun) and the various spacecraft involved are rendered with crispness and clarity. This sucker was obviously not just slapped together. Its the storytelling that feels hurried. In the future some 50 years after an insectoid race of aliens attacked Earth and killed millions our hero Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) is one of many pre-teen boys (and a few girls) who have enlisted in the international military academy. The training facilities are on a space station orbiting the Earth and the technology is advanced but otherwise its not much different from a prep school or a Hogwarts. Before the movie even starts overseers Col. Graff (Harrison Ford) and Maj. Anderson (Viola Davis) have detected great potential in Ender. In a matter of minutes theyve determined that his willingness to keep kicking an already-defeated bully is evidence of his suitability for military command. Shortly after that theyre fast-tracking him for battle training. Graff goes out of his way to praise Enders intelligence and skill in front of the other kids so theyll resent and challenge him. Ender does indeed rise quickly in the ranks showing a skill for strategy in the war games that he and his fellow cadets practice day in and day out. He outfoxes his jealous team leader the delightfully named Bonzo Madrid (Moises Arias) and bonds with female recruit Petra Arkanian (Hailee Steinfeld). His other friends Bean (Aramis Knight) and Alai (Suraj Partha) are present but under-utilized while his family members back on Earth hardly get any screen time at all. Just what it is about Ender that makes the higher-ups so sure hell be their savior remains a mystery both to him and to us. Yes hes smart -- but surely the army has had smart leaders before. (One of them played by Ben Kingsley appears later.) Why are we putting all our eggs in the Ender Wiggin basket? Thats the sort of thing that might be addressed if the movie werent constantly chugging from one plot point to the next rarely stopping to explore or ponder. Elements that were critical to the book (like the ""mind games"" Ender plays the dreams he has and his relationship with his siblings) are glossed over or omitted so the movie will have time to hit the required story beats -- never mind that those story beats dont mean anything if the film doesnt help us understand why theyre happening. Dodgy American accent aside Asa Butterfield (from ""Hugo"") acquits himself well enough in the lead role as does the rest of the young cast. Harrison Ford seems to be awake and paying attention and Viola Davis adds crucial gravitas to her few scenes as a sympathetic officer. By all appearances this should be an excellent sci-fi adventure. But Hood keeps such a steady unvaried pace that the revelations of the final act -- which should be HUGE -- have the same dramatic heft as everything else. And when everything weighs the same nothing weighs anything.

TWITTER Harrison Ford Asa Butterfield Hailie Steinfeld Viola Davis and Ben Kingsley star in Gavin Hoods adaptation of the classic 1985 sci-fi novel. Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggin lives a horrible life. The world hates the saucer-eyed 10-year-old for who and what he is. The kids in his school hate him because hes brilliant a strategic savant with the rare gift of being able to analyze any situation and see the way to achieve the most positive outcome even if that means putting a bully in the hospital. ""I wanted to win that fight and all the fights after that"" he explains coolly. His older brother hates him because well his older brother is a sociopath who gets his pubescent jollies by causing pain. His parents hate him because they had to get special dispensation to have a third child -- in this unspecified future population control is in full effect -- and he doesnt seem to be living up to his potential which as almost every adult around Ender tells him is to be nothing less that the savior of all mankind. PHOTOS 10 Classic Sci-Fi Movies With Better Effects Than Modern Films Enders Game like Orson Scott Cards 1985 novel upon which its based is a story about a boy forced to become a weapon and the old man operating the forge. If only adapter-director Gavin Hoods movie had been tempered with craft and care and wasnt such a blunt instrument one that seems designed as a delivery system for CGI derring-do instead of the heartbreaker it should be. Audiences who show up undeterred by the stink around Cards public stance against homosexuality and gay marriage will find that this attempt by Summit to kick-start another sci-fi franchise carries none of that odor but still falls somewhat short of inspired. Ender (Hugos Asa Butterfield seemingly always red around the eyes) was born some years after mankinds first contact with an alien species called the Formics which went about as well as most cinematic first contacts go with an all-out attack on Earth by a swarming advanced fleet that almost resulted in humanitys extermination. That invasion was halted due to the brilliance of one man Mazer Rackham (Ben Kingsley) who discovered the Formics weakness and exploited it to a devastating result. Since then the brass who runs Earths International Fleet has been fearing reprisal from those aliens and preparing for it by scouring the planet for the most brilliant children around. Children it is explained by Harrison Fords Col. Hyrum Graff in one of his many speeches can make leaps of logic of intuition that adults cant follow. So the Fleet has built a Battle School in Earths orbit a rotating fluorescent cross between boarding school boot camp and prison for those children so that the childhood can be hammered out of them. Ender has the same brilliance that made his sadistic brother Peter (Jimmy Jax Pinchak) and empathetic sister Valentine (Abigail Breslin) candidates for Battle School but while their tendencies washed them out of the program his ability to blend both violence and compassion made him Graffs favorite. PHOTOS 25 of Falls Most Anticipated Movies And so Ender is admitted into Battle School in which the dozens of kids are sorted into ""armies"" and pitted against each other in a constant competition. This is but one of many ways Enders Game shares more than a few similarities with J.K. Rowlings Harry Potter stories. (And given that Card published his book decades before Rowling the inspiration can go only one way.) They both center around children who have spent years being brutalized enduring mental and physical abuse at the hands of grown-ups and kids alike -- and because we see their pain and feel their anguish we understand why they lash out with violence and forgive them when they do. Here Enders story is like a sci-fi passion play; we know him only by the depth of his suffering. Enders Game is a film about empathy and the power that resides in empathy. The reason Ender succeeds is because he understands what makes his opponents tick on the battlefield in the locker rooms and in the classrooms. Oddly the film doesnt seem to have much empathy for its hero. The first 40 minutes are a parade of exposition where instead it should be inviting us inside Enders world so that we care about the horrors that are visited upon him in ways that arent about the horrors themselves. As Ender evolves through Battle School from a raw ""Launchie"" to the commander of his own army showing off his tactical prowess in a number of zero-gravity skirmishes in the spherical Battle Room Hood (X-Men Origins Wolverine) skips across the surface of his emotional journey counting on Graffs discussions with International Fleet shrink Major Anderson (Viola Davis) to fill in the blanks. The final act of Enders Game is where the meaning of the title becomes evident Ender is promoted to Command School where hes directed to plan and carry out a series of virtual attacks on the Formic fleet  training simulations aided by the friends he made in Battle School -- including Hailee Steinfelds Petra --  instructed by the legendary Rackham himself. Only here does the film achieve some emotional resonance as we finally get a real sense of the impossible pressures put upon Ender by the coterie of adults whove placed the fate of a civilization in his hands; by his brothers in arms whove hitched their wagons to his; and by himself to live up to his own destiny. PHOTOS 30 Groundbreaking Sci-Fi Films I wouldnt dream of giving away the climax to Enders Game other than to say it is almost worth enduring the shallowness that precedes it to get there. I will say however that the 15 minutes that follow are about as pointless as the last stretch in Psycho -- you know the bit where its suddenly a chatty courtroom drama. Youll spot the moment where Enders Game clearly shouldve ended and gaze fondly in the rear-view mirror as it passes by. Butterfield does his best to bring you inside Ender Wiggin using his wide blue eyes to try and convey a depth that Hoods script just doesnt support. And Ford constructs a man whos bearing vacillates between being legitimately haunted by the trauma hes got to inflict upon a wee lad and being mildly irked as if he doesnt want to read the cue cards on SNL. Steinfeld has so little to do as Enders confidante she just kind of fades into the scenery instead of registering as the surrogate sister and nascent love interest shes designed to be. The special effects are fine but Enders Game has the bad luck to be coming on the heels of Gravity. In the book the scenes of combat in the Battle Room -- featuring as many as 30 kids streaking through zero-gravity executing formations and maneuvers on the fly -- seemed to be unfilmable. While Hood and his CG wizards do a more than decent job anyone whos seen Alfonso Cuarons wizardry will have seen it done far far better.

"Review Enders Game a stunning success - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Enders Game a stunning successBy Tony Hicksthicksbayareanewsgroup.comPosted 10/30/2013 030000 PM PDTUpdated 10/30/2013 044945 PM PDT Related StoriesOct 30Hicks Will Orson Scott Cards outspokenness affect Enders Game?For loyal fans of Orson Scott Cards classic sci-fi novel ""Enders Game"" the film adaptation might as well be subtitled ""As Good As It Gets.""Considering the weighty source material and complex sprawling story line with which director/screenwriter Gavin Hood was working ""Enders Game"" which clocks in at just under two hours couldnt have made its translation from page to screen much more convincingly.In the not-too-distant future Earth has been ravaged by an attack from an alien race called the Formics. Barely fighting them off thanks to the heroics of legendary pilot Mazer Rackham (Ben Kingsley) the human race has spent several decades preparing for the Formics return. Its been decided that only highly trained children will have the ability to defeat the enemy. Enter Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) a conflicted child-genius who possess the right combination of intelligence empathy and killer instinct that Col. Hyrum Graff (the appropriately gruff Harrison Ford) wants for his training program.Being one of the youngest and smallest recruits at Graffs in-orbit Battle School Ender is the underdog in every situation and thats partially by Graffs design. If hes going to save the human race Ender has to endure everything his fellow humans can throw at him to ensure him a chance against the Formics. His struggles bring about a moral dilemma Is it acceptable to turn a child into a killing machine even if its for the greater good? Its something over which Graff and his immediate underling Maj. Anderson (Viola Davis) clash.Advertisement Butterfield shines at the center of it all. He impeccably balances intensity with convincing emotion as a brilliant isolated child under intense pressure who really just wants to play computer games and be with his sister Valentine (played fantastically by Abigail Breslin in a role considerably smaller than in the novel). Hailee Steinfeld plays Enders Battle School companion Petra Arkanian giving the character more passion and humanity than originally written. But even with a smart story thats well-adapted and bolstered by good acting ""Enders Games"" top asset is its special effects. The Battle School scenes where ""armies"" of trainees square off in zero gravity are simply riveting (I cant wait to see the video games this movie spawns). Where some films spend too much time with computer-generated graphics ""Enders Game"" gives you just enough and they get better as the film goes on. One of the flaws of the story is its predictable outcome. So the question becomes not what happens but how it happens. The story involves a major twist (full of moral implications) that director Hood handles well pumping extra believable human emotion into the final scenes.Serious fans of the books may complain about what was left out while those unfamiliar with the novel may get a bit confused at times (I heard people espousing both opinions while leaving the theater). This was not an easy book to adapt to the big screen -- its one reason why it took years to make ""Enders Game."" One major subplot was left out and other ideas were tailored for a better fit. But give Hood credit ""Enders Game"" truly captures the spirit and intensity of what is one of the most popular sci-fi stories of all time.

An anti-bullying allegory writ on the largest possible scale ""Enders Game"" frames an interstellar battle between mankind and pushy ant-like aliens called Formics in which Earths fate hinges on a tiny group of military cadets most of whom havent even hit puberty yet. At face value the film presents an electrifying star-wars scenario -- that rare case where an epic space battle transpires entirely within the span of two hours -- while at the same time managing to deliver a higher pedagogical message about tolerance empathy and coping under pressure. Against considerable odds this risky-sounding Orson Scott Card adaptation actually works as director Gavin Hood pulls off the sort of teen-targeted franchise starter Summit was hoping for.This story first appeared in the October 29 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. Actually considering that the distrib behind ""The Twilight Saga"" was counting on ""Enders Game"" to supply the companys next YA powerhouse perhaps those hopes run a wee bit high (the ""Twilight"" pics have collectively earned 3.3 billion in global B.O.) though all involved seem to have adjusted their expectations in recent months between rumors of production woes and a publicity nightmare involving Cards anti-gay statements. Sequels seem less certain than they once did for this expensive effects-heavy feature though Hood has more than salvaged the initial assignment turning in an impressive thought-provoking astro-adventure that benefits from the biggest screen available (Imax where possible). Cards novel assumes a situation where in the wake of a massive Formic attack the worlds children are somehow best suited to protect their planet from an imminent second strike. The most promising young recruits train on elaborate videogame-like simulators while a pair of officers -- Col. Hyrum Graff (Harrison Ford) and Major Gwen Anderson (Viola Davis) -- monitor their techniques in search of ""the One"" a child with the strategic instincts to save his species. The leading candidate is Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) a runt-like outsider whose behavior toward his aggressive classmates reveals his true potential. Like ""The Hunger Games"" the pic peddles the unseemly idea of watching kids thrust into life-and-death situations. Though theyre not instructed to kill one another these moppets prime directive should also give parents pause raising the stakes from hand-to-hand combat to the potential genocide of an unfamiliar race. Fortunately Hood (who also penned the adaptation) factors these weighty themes into the story without making them the primary focus. Between the officers Graffs agenda is more complicated than he lets on while Anderson represents the voice of reason remarking ""It used to be a war crime to recruit anyone under the age of 15."" But these are not soldiers per se but highly skilled Junior ROTC types training on virtual conflict scenarios. Butterfield -- who has grown into his big blue eyes if not the rest of his body since ""Hugo"" -- makes ideal casting for Ender Hes scrawny and physically unimposing yet theres an intensity to his stare that suggests he might indeed be masking deeper (or darker) gifts. Its nothing so powerful as the Force or Neos Matrix-bending abilities though ""Enders Game"" dedicates nearly its entire run time to Battle School where our hero and his fellow recruits practice various drills including an anti-gravity game (the rules of which arent terribly clear) that looks like the next best thing to Quidditch. Despite the obvious ""be all you can be"" subtext ""Enders Game"" manages to make these training sequences compelling without veering into pro-military propaganda doing so by focusing on the interpersonal dynamics between the various squad members. Though Card may have publicly revealed his own prejudices the casting department has assembled a wonderfully diverse group of actors -- male and female they come in all colors shapes and sizes -- to serve alongside Ender including not only Latino best friend Bean (Aramis Knight) but also a fresh set of rivals and bullies led by the odd-looking Bonzo (""Hannah Montanas"" Moises Arias). Generally speaking these arent your typical Teen Nick selects; instead the pic counts two teen Oscar nominees (Hailee Steinfeld as squad-mate Petra and Abigail Breslin as his sister Valentine) among its solid young ensemble. So much youthful energy onscreen makes Ford seem tired and weary by comparison. Still its a treat to discover Han Solo all buttoned up and back to do more space battle -- not that anyone here is quite as lively or memorable as the characters B-movie fans discovered in ""Star Wars"" three dozen years ago. Butterfields ""Hugo"" co-star Ben Kingsley also pops up for a late cameo sporting an Australian accent and an elaborate Maori tribal tattoo across his entire face (a poor mans Darth Maul perhaps?). It might not seem fair to compare what Hood has created to someone as visionary in all things sci-fi as George Lucas and yet considering the sizable budget expended on ""Enders Game"" one could have hoped for something a bit more groundbreaking. Even so the sleek production design (by ""Tron Legacys"" Sean Haworth and Ben Procter) and costumes (created by another ""Tron Legacy"" alum Christine Bieselin Clark) suggest a sleek stylish future. Steven Jablonskys mostly-digital score which sounds like Daft Punk plus strings cements the films debt to that recent Disney reboot and yet ""Enders Game"" pushes the vidgame dynamic even further as the characters progress level by level game by game toward their epic showdown with the Formics. Sequences involving the swarming alien ships both in flashback to the earlier Earth invasion and in the pics white-knuckle finale look plenty stunning but somehow lack the sense of imminent threat the film sorely needs. The kids never seem to be in any real danger; nor does their home planet. Perhaps thats for the best considering how intense it already is for them to be marching about saluting and spouting dialogue that normally belongs in the mouths of grown soldiers. Certainly intergalactic war must qualify as what the MPAA calls ""adult situations"" and yet the film handles the showdown responsibly enough -- including an open-ended epilogue about the consequences of Enders actions -- that kids may come away from it better equipped to handle conflict on an interpersonal scale.

Steven Cluck says November 13 2013 at 201 am A film should be able to stand on its own without requiring someone to read a book first. Having said that Ive read almost all of Orson Scott Cards books. I know the story of Ender very well and have been looking forward to this movie. But as I watched the movie I could point to scene after scene which can only be understood if you had read the book first. The scenes make no sense in context to the movie. It reminds me of 2001 a Space Odyssey. Anyone who loves this movie has read the book everyone else like myself says what just happened? I saw Enders Game in an Imax theatre on opening night with maybe 10 other people in the audience. I would love to see sequels but the movie didnt have the character development of his siblings to show how they would fit into the other books. Again only if you read the book first would you see how strong a character Peter really is. Maybe on DVD this movie will be better. Im hoping the deleted scenes show the story better than what remained on the screen. Reply Eric says November 5 2013 at 852 am Serious? What the F do I care about anything in the review other than the Fn movie itself? Im looking forward to seeing it in the theatres. Its the only one this year that has interested me enough to NOT wait until DVD. As for PD keep your personal views about other people to yourself. I dont give a hit about your bigotry. Reply Pete says November 5 2013 at 514 am ""Though Card may have publicly revealed his own prejudices the casting department has assembled a wonderfully diverse group of actors -- male and female they come in all colors shapes and sizes -- to serve alongside Ender"" The reviewer has unintentionally beaten himself with the Irony-bat. He seems to imply surprise that Card hasnt let his biases into the movie. At the same time he lets his own biases into the review. Anyone who knows anything about Card would be aware of his statements that one shouldnt use ones writing to score political points - its all about the story/writing. In contrast the reviewer uses a poorly-written review (not even having read the book or hed know about the diversity of the characters) to showcase his own political beliefs. Instead like Card hed have been better served by focusing on the assigned task - writing a thorough review. Hows that bat feel? Reply Washington Nearsider says November 5 2013 at 336 am ""Though Card may have publicly revealed his own prejudices the casting department has assembled a wonderfully diverse group of actors - male and female they come in all colors shapes and sizes - to serve alongside Ender including not only Latino best friend Bean (Aramis Knight) but also a fresh set of rivals and bullies led by the odd-looking Bonzo (""Hannah Montanas"" Moises Arias)."" Its not the ""casting"" department thats responsible for the ethnic diversity of Enders Game. Its Card. All of those ""wonderfully diverse"" parts-Bean Bonzo Petra-were written as such by Card. Im slightly surprised Debruge doesnt know that. Reply J.ALBERT Leyes says November 4 2013 at 1055 pm Really ? Are you surprised that the ""reviewer"" didnt read the book? i am wondering if he has really seen the movie and if he did what he was on . Bottom line the CGI cinematics are very good the adaptation and the acting mediocre at best. This is a very forgettable flick if in the future you come across this movie flipping channels on the TV trust me you better of watching an old episode of Star Trek that you havent see before. The worse thing is that is set up for a sequel . Reply tiffanyscripsit says November 2 2013 at 1243 am Hopefully there will be a movie for the sequel. While Enders Game delves into the psychology of children in warfare Speaker for the Dead is more of an anthropological novel examining the consequences of ""othering"" and colonialism. Neither novel is for children-but the first one is about them whereas the sequel is about adults. James McAvoy could do well as an older Andrew Wiggin who has grown into his 35 years with fevered gaze intact. Reply amrtheamerican says November 1 2013 at 232 pm ""Though Card may have publicly revealed his own prejudices the casting department has assembled a wonderfully diverse group of actors."" The heck? The characters are diverse IN THE BOOK. Alai is an African Muslim Bean is Greek Bonso is Spanish Petra is Armenian Fly is Chinese Mazer Rackham is Maori IN THE BOOK. Card wrote a whole novel about Muslims and Africans going back in time to stop Christopher Columbus and the genocide of the Americans. This is simply slanderous. Reply Keith says October 31 2013 at 736 am This is really one of the most mis-informed reviews Ive ever read. I understand not reading the book before every adaptation but dont make sweeping generalizations if you dont know the source material. Reply John says October 30 2013 at 414 pm Hi Peter Did you not understand the premise of the book? "" The kids never seem to be in any real danger; nor does their home planet."" The kind were ""never"" in danger because they were playing a war game. Reply Corinne says October 27 2013 at 932 pm ""While Card had revealed his own prejudice...the _casting department_ has provided a wonderful diversity of actors""??? Are you kidding?? Have you at all examined the source material? Cards original novel has always been the hallmark of diversity lol and while full congragaltions are deserved for the casting department for finding excellent young thespians to fill the various roles its hardly their own invention In fact your statement is twice offensive not only did Card write the original diversity but the fact that it still REMAINS after this long in Hollywood-development-hell is a testament to his insistence on maintaining the storys integrity Reply dara says October 29 2013 at 458 pm Well said I fully agree Reply Bill says October 26 2013 at 1218 am Yes lets be thankful theres no pro-military propaganda."" Wed never want kids thinking that risking your life to defend Hollywoods right to hate them was at all worthwhile. Reply cullen says October 25 2013 at 719 pm I dont know how theyll make a sequel anyways. Will the continue on the next book in the Ender series which takes place centuries in the future with an older Ender and Valentine or will they take the story to Earth and follow Bean and his books? I personally wouldnt mind either series. I could see people put off by the rest of the Ender series because of how it drifts away dramatically from Enders Game. Theres virtually no action in the next two books and the last two deal with some insane metaphysical questions. Where as the Bean series will deal with a lot more action and be placed on Earth as various countries position themselves for power using Enders team as a commanders for their country. Plus the Bean books have the super villain in Achilles. Reply Benders Aim says October 25 2013 at 417 pm The movie doesnt have Wesley Snipes as ""Kusho"". So Im not going to see it Ill stick to Demolition Man with Sly Stallone Snipes and Sandrod Bullock Reply D.J. Schreffler says October 25 2013 at 116 pm A major point of the book is that it could not appear as though there were an immanent threat so that Ender could defeat it. If he knew it were real he would not have successfully commanded. To be true to the book that same dynamic has to hold true with it appearing as just a game until the dramatic reveal at the end of the final simulation. So for one who prefers movie adaptations to be true to the book the lack of immanent threat is a feature not a bug. Reply ty says October 28 2013 at 1108 am Hope nobody saw that comment who hasnt already read the book. Reply richard kraanen says October 28 2013 at 314 am I fully agree This is the only comment that makes sense so far. Reading all comments I really wonder whether many people have understood the underlying philosophical issues of both the Enders game novel and its fololow-up Speaker for the Dead. Reply Robert Penner says October 25 2013 at 948 am A few minor ethnic issues 1. In the novels Bean is Greek and Nigerian. The actor Aramis Knight is a mix of German Indian and Pakistani. Was there something in the film that implied Bean was Latino? 2. Mazer Rackham is half-Maori native of New Zealand not Australia. 3. Suggesting that a Maori face tattoo is ""a poor mans Darth Maul"" is puzzling to say the least. These tattoos are a sacred artform in Maori culture. The tattoo enhances Rackhams character as a Maori warrior. http//www.newzealand.com/travel/media/features/maori-culture/maori_ta-moko-significance_feature.cfm Darth Maul on the other hand exemplified neo-Lucas ""visionary"" style over substance. Darth Maul was barely a character. He spoke exactly two lines. ""At last we will have revenge."" Revenge for what? But since Darth Maul also has stuff on his face and looks cooler on a movie poster an actual character displaying the marks of a real culture somehow pales in comparison. Reply amrtheamerican says November 1 2013 at 252 pm Well said Reply Paul Crowley says October 25 2013 at 929 am I dont think the author of this article completely gets the point behind Enders Game. Certainly he doesnt understand the meaning behind the title. Why does the boy have the nickname ""Ender""? wondering about that question might lead a bit further.I want to see this movie. I want to see what has been made from the book. As far as I am concerned the book and its first sequel are all about monsters. What it comes down to is when you decide that the only way to fight a monstrous enemy is to create a monster well you end up with a monster. In this case a monster with a conscience. Reply Stephen Miller says October 25 2013 at 901 am ""Though Card may have publicly revealed his own prejudices the casting department has assembled a wonderfully diverse group of actors -- male and female they come in all colors shapes and sizes -- to serve alongside Ender"" I found the reviewers statement intolerant inflammatory and absent any form of critical thought. Trying to tar Mr. Card with a racist/misygonist brush because he doesnt affirm a homosexual agenda is just transparently pathetic. Reply E Heung says October 25 2013 at 1226 pm Well-said and true But what do you expect from so-called ""journalists"" these days whether they write for CNN CBS...or Variety Reply Geri McCall-Barrath says October 25 2013 at 901 am What a shame the author of the article felt the need to compare ""Enders Game"" with ""Star Wars"". SW was great special effects for its time - but in truth little more than a western set in space. EG is based on a wonderful book with an amazing story. Yes they both have a huge battle but whereas SW is all about the battle EG is all about the preparation. Im SO relieved to read that the majority of the film is set in battle school. The trailers make it appear as if its nothing but a space battle (yawn - been there done that). Ive been recommending the book for years but after seeing the trailers I stopped because I thought they had ruined the novel by focusing on the battle. So glad to hear they havent. Reply mel cohen says October 25 2013 at 836 am I support this Directors opinion about creepy homos but will prolly not see this movie. Dont ask dont tell and stop being so shrill. Reply D.J. Schreffler says October 25 2013 at 118 pm This appears to be a false-flag troll trying to make those who hold a view look bad because he actually supports the other view. Reply Michael Anthony says October 25 2013 at 755 am Sorry but no go for me. For decades Card has spread the word of the evils of homosexuality. His comments are deplorable and actually give ammunition to bullies. Now that the film is coming out he pleads for tolerance from the very people he has condemned many years. Card is entitled to his views. But when he repeatedly attacks a minority publically he deserves all the kickback he gets. Reply jongoffyahoo.com says October 31 2013 at 1240 am You have no idea what youre talking about. Card has never attacked homosexuals or homosexuality. In his book Songbird he does nothing to condemn homosexuals. He has a gay character who is a close friend and lover to the main character so you simply have no idea what your talking about. He has simply said he doesnt believe in gay marriage. A lot of people dont. If I avoided movies that involved people I didnt agree with Id never see another movie. Grow up adults can have disagreements without pitching a fit. Children however take their ball and go home because they are immature little brats. Which are you and adult or child? Reply James says October 25 2013 at 554 am Wheres the tolerance for discrimination??? I find it laughable when people say gay agenda- which is what exactly? And how is it being shoved down your throat exactly? The reviewer only mentioned because it was an issue and this really should only be about the movie not about what the authors comments were. Reply Ty says October 25 2013 at 144 pm The ""gay agenda"" includes targeting people who dont believe that homosexuality is right - a couple running Bamp;B in England who didnt allow non-married couples a young woman photographer in N.M. who didnt do gay weddings and bringing legal cases against them to force them to shut down or violate their moral beliefs. Craig James was fired from Fox Sports for having expressed an opinion a year prior alongside 50% of America that gay marriage was not good for our country. The ""gay agenda"" is about disregarding freedom of conscience for anyone with a differing opinion. Reply E Heung says October 25 2013 at 1230 pm ""...gay agenda-which is what exactly?"" Are you dead or asleep or just stupid James? Read much about ""gay marriage"" these days? Reply Chris Luther says October 25 2013 at 515 am Clearly the author of this article didnt read the book. Reply Doug Baggett says October 25 2013 at 619 am Actually Im more interested in what people see WITHOUT reading the book. Reply Sam says October 25 2013 at 555 am This is a review of the movie is it not? Reply Michael Barnett says October 25 2013 at 954 am Yes its a review of the movie but had the author read the book hed know that the diversity he doesnt expect from Card is you know EXACTLY HOW IT IS IN THE BOOK. See? secret says October 25 2013 at 434 am Agreed Reply Anthony Henriquez says October 25 2013 at 401 am Anti-bullying? Did anybody on your staff read the book at all? Its about destroying an alien species not anti-bullying. The government today in real life has a campaign against that. We dont need science fiction to start carrying their water. Reply Robert Penner says October 25 2013 at 953 am Ender was bullied for most of the novel. Reply Joe says October 25 2013 at 808 am If you read the next book Speaker for the Dead you can easily see the anti-bullying message from the stroy.

Directed by Gavin Hood (""X-Men Origins Wolverine"") from his own adaptation of Orson Scott Cards novel of the same name it sacrifices none of the source materials complexity in chronicling the eponymous heros journey from trainee to commander of Earths armies. In doing so hes successfully crafted an allegorical film designed to attract large numbers of kids -- even if many of them will miss the intricacies of its underlying message. Asa Butterfield (""Hugo"") plays Ender Wiggin a military trainee in a futuristic society where adults enlist children as the first line of defense against an imminent alien invasion. Chosen by Col. Graff (Harrison Ford) for Battle School because of his penchant for strategic thinking Ender quickly rises through the ranks but not without creating a few enemies and generally alienating himself from the others. See photos Enders Game Stills Harrison Ford Hailee Steinfeld Asa Butterfield After proving himself in the academys zero-gravity war simulator Ender is promoted to Command School and put through rigorous training to learn how to control entire armies in combat situations. But as the stakes for his simulations intensify he begins to question whether the complete and total destruction of his enemies - even if its to eliminate future conflicts - is truly the best strategy that he can use. Although it utilizes the same heros-journey boilerplate that provided the foundation for everything from ""Star Wars"" to ""Harry Potter"" ""Enders Game"" seems to come by it honestly at least insofar as Ender goes through real tribulations physical and philosophical to earn his spot as ""The One."" See video Harrison Ford Introduces First Enders Game Footage Ostracized for being the third kid in a world that mandates two per family he embodies the balance between his brother Peters aggression and sister Valentines compassion and Graff repeatedly tests not only his body but his problem-solving abilities and perhaps most importantly his resolve in the face of adversity. Thanks to Hoods sophisticated adaptation of Cards source material theres much topically to appreciate from an adult perspective not the least of which being the questionable morality of a pre-emptive military strike. But like a disillusioned adolescent discovering that his parents lie Ender experiences a powerful epiphany when he discovers that his superiors efforts to protect him from the repercussions of his actions have made him blind to the moral and emotional weight of his sacrifice-for-the-common-good strategies. Also read Enders Game Author Orson Scott Card Responds to Boycott Calls Gay Marriage Issue Moot Reunited with cinematographer Don McAlpine with whom he collaborated on ""Origins""  Hood seems more confident tackling this big-budget opus than his previous one skillfully navigating his character through the grown-up complexities of training exercises which outwardly seem like childs play. That said those deeper themes occasionally make the film feel like a bit of a joyless slog and even at two packed hours some of the mythology of this kid-based futuristic world feels rushed. As a young man placed in charge of responsibilities much bigger than himself Butterfield struggles with his characters destiny about as well as a child actor can lending him the right notes of naivete when necessary without undermining his believability as the most formidable military mind in the seventh grade. Meanwhile Ford offers a perfect foil in Graff (more like gruff) for Enders developing maturity applying the stick and the carrot in equal measures to simultaneously build confidence and nurture his leadership skills. See video Enders Game Trailer Asa Butterfield Hailee Steinfeld Are a New Kind of Soldier Bolstered by solid performances and a clean elegant visual style Hood ultimately delivers a film that actually earns the distinction of being for audiences of all ages. But he accomplishes this insurmountable task not by successfully tapping into his adult viewers inner children but by appealing to childrens inner adults -- not quite asking them to grow up but just begin to consider the more complicated world that lurks out on the horizon. Ultimately as much a polemic as tentpole entertainment ""Enders Game"" is a rare example of filmmaking with a scalpel at a scale that usually demands a hatchet. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

The cheerleaders of the geek-net already managed to talk gullible studio bosses into bankrolling flops like Watchmen and John Carter but their work is not yet done. Based on a moderately popular 1985 sci-fi novel Enders Game is yet another intriguing complex strangely unlikeable big-budget experiment destined to thrill the fans and befuddle the rest of us. The first half is crammed with ideas as 12-year-old strategic prodigy Ender Wiggin (a wonderfully frosty Asa Butterfield) is hand-picked to lead Earths military in the war against alien Formics. The cast are strong the effects well designed and the scripts interest in how violence influences and inspires children is timely and insightful. But it falters once the actual war begins Ben Kingsley shows up as a Maori warrior with the weirdest imaginable accent the final battle is uninvolving and theres an unconvincing upbeat coda. Enders Game ends up being fitfully engaging and endearingly odd.

It is difficult to decide where to start. On a positive point the film looks great though I might well amend that opinion if the actual film of Gravity is as amazing looking as the trailer hints at. Its just a shame it is backed by such a dull and monotone script. No doubt Ford and Davies looked at the cheque and held their nose at what they were being asked to do. Both Steinfeld and Butterfield need to get better agents if this is what they are being advised to do. There are a number of disturbing sub plots one of which involves the led character and his sister who may not be his sister but some form of alien and an underlying sexual sub plot between the two. Also the rather chaste but smouldering passion between Steinfeld and Butterfields characters despite Butterfields character being obviously considerably younger. I imagine the losses that this will make will prevent the sequel being made. Pretty to look at but otherwise very very disappointing. I felt like I needed a bath after watching it.

In the book you are led to believe something for the entire book and are then turned completely upside down in the final scene and the enormity of what was done hits you. The scenes of Ender in training being overwhelmed unfairly with odds stacked against him higer and higer and then going on to some sort of graduate school"" for further ""training"" all lead you down a path for WTF.
