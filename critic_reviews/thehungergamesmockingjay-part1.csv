However it is still very entertaining with strong performances all around. A good set up for the finale. See you there.

"The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 1 - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 1 Posted by Christy Lemire on November 23 2014 27 Comments Lionsgate Films Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action some disturbing images and thematic material. Running time 123 minutes. Two stars out of four. Despite its action and revelations its substantial political allegory and its strong performances from a tremendous cast ""The Hunger Games Mockingkay -- Part 1"" still feels like one long placeholder. Its an elaborate game of hurry-up-and-wait. And its the most shameless example yet of splitting the final book in a hugely popular series into two film adaptations. The ""Harry Potter"" and ""Twilight"" franchises took the same approach with some success. Actually the absolute last ""Twilight"" movie is so exciting in such an insane way that deviates so daringly from the text it almost excuses all the films that preceded it. ""Mockingjay -- Part 1"" features some tweaks and expansion of its own in bringing the third book in Suzanne Collins trilogy to the screen but they do little to enhance the story. More often they feel like filler and they make the split seem like a rather transparent attempt to cash in twice. (And it worked ""Mockingjay -- Part 1"" made an estimated 123 million in its opening weekend.) Director Francis Lawrences movie has some smarts and some thrills but too often it feels like a turgid repetitive slog especially compared to the excitement and the cliffhanger ending of its predecessor ""Catching Fire"" (which Lawrence also directed). Still as the heroic teen Katniss Everdeen Jennifer Lawrence once again engages us by finding that tricky balance between bravery and vulnerability. Considering the diverse and mature work shes done amid the ""Hunger Games"" movies from ""Silver Linings Playbook"" to ""American Hustle"" to ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" its a pleasant change to see her looking young and fresh-faced again. At the same time it feels like shes moved beyond this YA-novel futuristic dystopia by now. This time Katniss must serve as the reluctant face and voice of the revolution that is sweeping across Panem. The games are over and we now know that the man who devised the sadistic competition Plutarch Heavensbee (the late great Philip Seymour Hoffman to whom the film is dedicated) is a key figure in the rebellion. Katniss her mother and her younger sister Prim are now among the refugees in the secret rebel headquarters of District 13 a massive underground bunker led by the all-business President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore in an extremely different ""Boogie Nights"" reunion with Hoffman). The massively overqualified cast does so much to elevate this material beyond its familiar post-apocalyptic trappings. Theres a scene in which Hoffman Moore and Jeffrey Wright (returning as gadget guru Beetee) are sitting around a conference table in the District 13 war room strategizing with Lawrence as Katniss which feels way more substantive than it might through the sheer presence of these performers. The political satire element of ""Mockingjay -- Part 1"" is its strength. In order to rally the people to persevere and push on with their fight Katniss must star in a series of propaganda films. She must become the Mockingjay -- the physical symbol of strength and hope -- complete with a high-tech outfit special effects and inspirational (but fake) background footage. Hoffman serves as the shrewd and sardonic puppetmaster. But another key member of Katniss team is her old Capitol escort Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) now deglammed in the same drab wardrobe as the rest of the folks who are lucky to be alive in 13. Effie doesnt even appear in this section of the book but Banks playful flamboyance is a welcome source of humor in this otherwise dour setting. (And while this was probably unintentional her appearance in a makeshift turban is reminiscent of Jared Letos transsexual turn in ""Dallas Buyers Club."") At its best this subplot calls to mind the sharply cynical commentary of Barry Levinsons ""Wag the Dog"" with its fabricated war. But then ""Mockingjay -- Part 1"" believes its own hype and sends Katniss out into real scenes of battle and squalor in hopes of achieving a sense of authenticity. While Katniss willingness to set out among the people provides some disturbing and violent images it also smothers the film in a suffocating sameness. The carnage and destruction in District 8 looks like District 13 looks like District 2. Every place she goes Katniss scales a pile of bone and rubble only to reach the top and realize theres even more as far as the eye can see. While Lawrence is more than capable of displaying a fiery presence too often shes relegated to furrowing her brow in sadness. While the rebellions team is penetrating the airwaves with its feisty messages the creepy and tyrannical President Snow (Donald Sutherland) responds in kind airing interviews between game show host Caesar Flickerman (an underused Stanley Tucci) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) Katniss former competitor-turned-companion. Turns out hes alive and hes become the Capitols mouthpiece. Still Katniss finds herself once again torn emotionally between this twisted version of Peeta and good old reliable Gale (Liam Hemsworth) her childhood best friend. The hunky Gale is clearly the correct choice for her although both dudes remain woefully bland. The ""Hunger Games"" series has never been about Katniss inner conflict in the midst of a love triangle though. Its been about her being a bad-ass and defining herself not by a man but by her own actions either through a selfless gesture or her strength with a bow and arrow. Yet in the most dangerous sequence in ""Mockingjay -- Part 1"" shes stuck staring in frustration at a series of television monitors while the men carry out a ""Zero Dark Thirty""-style rescue mission. She -- and we -- will have to wait for her to reclaim her glory a year from now in ""Mockingjay -- Part 2.""

Seemed like filler in the filler. Rich Chambers Reply November 23 2014  by  Miguel Cruz     Not having read the books I suspect this one is almost scene for scene faithful. How else to explain how 85% of the movie consists of people describing offscreen events. You can get away with that when its words on a page. But cinema demands we be out into the actual scene and not hear someones recounting of it. Reply December 17 2014  by  Megan     It really is. Ive read the books several times and even some of the dialogue was taken word-for-word from the book. The only big deviation from what I remember of the book was the climax where we see Finnick talking while Gale and the others conduct the rescue. As I recall in the book shes just told that the rescue is underway and a short time later it cuts to her seeing Peeta. But yeah apart from that and the inclusion of Effie its the most literal adaption of a movie from a book that Ive ever seen. Reply November 24 2014  by  Evan     Really? THE most shameless example? I assume you didnt see the last two Twilight movies one of which was a 2 hour wedding. Reply November 24 2014  by  Evan     Oh yeah and the second of which included an added 45 minute dream sequence... Reply November 24 2014  by  Gary     The dream sequence is the one change everybody loved. Twilight and Harry Potter did well in their splits but MOCKINGJAY did not. Reply December 19 2014  by  mike     I finally saw mockingjay and couldnt disagree more regarding the split into 2 parts. I had no issues with where/how it ended and felt overall it was done just as well as catching fire (albeit with a completely different feel/pace). The ending wasnt all that much different in regards to leaving the audience hanging than fire was since it all pretty much picked up again after her learning of district 12. Sure this one was more mid scene but man what an emotional scene that was to leave us with. It personally made me want to take the ride again soon. Reply November 24 2014  by  Fred Arnold     You realize its exactly like the book. And the book was shit. So the movies will be shit too. Reply February 22 2015  by  Riley     Ditto. The last book only got read because of the first 2. Even catching fire wasnt as much fun as the first but at least it was still cool and interesting. I even reread this book series but could put myself through the last book. On the other hand the first movie felt like a censored censored plot accurate rendering of the first book. Reply November 24 2014  by  Gary     Both the Twilight and the Harry Potter films that were split into two films were 750+ page books. This was a 390 page book. What could have been put into 45 minutes was put into 2 hours. The movie was long and hard to sit through and its box office gross will suffer. I dont think it will even hit 240 million in the US. It is getting bad word of mouth. Reply November 25 2014  by  Heather R     This book didnt need to be split. If they remain true to the book no one is going to like the ending. I have a feeling the last movie is going to be awful just like the book was. Reply November 25 2014  by  Jon U     Miss Lemire I will be following your lead going forward with movie reviews. This review was spot on. Can I have the last two hours of my life back? So blatantly obvious this movie was all about making a few extra bucks... Reply November 27 2014  by  Rick Harris     Hunger games was like taking a sleeping pill .you are exactly Correct. Its all about the money Reply November 28 2014  by  Andre Hunt     I havent read the books. I personally enjoyed this movie because it gave me a much richer picture of the entire universe they are living in and all the dynamics associated with it. The first two movies were so much associated around the games that I didnt get a rich sense of the overall feel of the world the movies took place in. Now I get it. Reply November 30 2014  by  bigtruckseriesreview     The ""Zero Dark Thirty"" allegory is unavoidable. Im glad the series is drawing to a close. I have no idea what to expect - and I dont read the books for spoilers. Reply May 24 2015  by  Uday Jhunjhunwala     Umm the books are the originals. Try reading for a change. Better explanations of the universe and peoples moods. You just cannot spoil an adaptation of a book by READING THE BOOK. Reply December 3 2014  by  roxy     I respectfully disagree that its the most shameless split.Dont get me wrong they are all shameless splits made with the sole purpose of cashing in as much money as possible; and this movie is absolutely not amazing its clearly a bridge between the second and the final movie.But please do not try to tell me that this movie was worse than the two hours Breaking Dawn Part 1 movie which consisted of Edward and Bella getting married and having sex.That whole movie could have been done in 40 minutes tops.The fact that the final Twilight book had 700 pages is irrelevant.Most of those were filler pages with nothing exciting happening for entire chapters. Reply December 5 2014  by  Christian Toto     Its hard to get angry at Hollywood for splitting up the final story ... look at those box office figures Still its a shame to gather all this talent and not give them something energizing to do beyond keeping a straight face as they say each others names. Reply December 5 2014  by  Antonio Gutierrez     If you guys had read this book and understood it your perception of the movie would be different. The first two movies were action packed but mockingjay is different. The book is designed in a way to give you a backbone to the second half. Once part 2 comes out you will realize the importance of the slow-paced film. Part 1 is warming you up for Part 2 if you want action then get ready for part 2. The book has been so cleverly devised that you will overlook the fact that part 1 has less action and realize the importance of it. Reply May 24 2015  by  Uday Jhunjhunwala     Thank you for finally conveying the fact that this movie was a build-up to the action that is going to be part 2. I personally have not seen the movie but then the book up to this point was also pretty muck Katniss waiting around and her struggles in 13. Not much action there. Reply May 24 2015  by  Uday Jhunjhunwala     Sorry much instead of muck Reply December 6 2014  by  Gerald Egan     This review summed things up well. This film was awful. Reply December 9 2014  by  Ian kettle     Anyone going to way-in on The Hobbit... That is where shameful splits are out of controls For me this movie was in its own right a moving once of entertainment that did a lot about where we are all heading in the not so distant future... The costume department could do with being banged-up... But other than that... I am enjoying the series.. Reply December 15 2014  by  Larry Swearingen     Just saw Mockingjay 1 what a let down  The whole plot seemed contrived and stiff. Jennifer Lawrence seemed bored with her role and possibly suffering from moods attributable to PMS instead of the kick ass that she portrayed in the 2 previous movies. I couldnt wait for this film to be over. Yes it did also seem that it was just fluff and fill for part 2 to come but I dont know if I can tolerate another lackluster performance by this cast again... Reply Pingback Full ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 1 (2014)"" Movie Review Watch Online  FridayMojo January 1 2015  by  Abby     I understand that Twilight needed a two part movie but Harry Potter and possibly the Hobbit (I havent read the book yet) are the only two that deserves two parts. Harry potter did extremely well and they still had to cut certain chapters out to make room for everything. Mockingjay was a bore and the only great scene was the Hanging Tree. Hunger Games has always been greedy for money and this just proves it. Part 1 is boring and Part 2 will be laughable with the amount of action and death that people will be bored Turing a 360 page book into a two part movie is just another reason why Hollywood is greedy for money. Only bad part is that people adore this garbage and Hollywood keeps feeding it to the media.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Christopher Orr Nov 21 2014 Culture First it was the custodians of the Harry Potter franchise choosing to split J.K. Rowlings final ottoman-sized tome The Deathly Hallows into two separate films. A year later the Twilight folks followed suit. Then television execs caught on with AMC dividing the final seasons of Breaking Bad and Mad Men into two calendar years apiece--a cleavage that made nonsensical both the words ""final"" and ""season."" (The latter after all once had a meaning that extended beyond ""sequence of television episodes."") Even though the second Avengers movie wont be released for another six months weve already been informed that the final chapter of the ""trilogy"" (another word getting stretched beyond recognition) will be doled out in two installments. And please dont get me started on Peter Jacksons rampant--and ongoing--Hobbit inflation. At this rate we can expect the showrunners of Game of Thrones to divide George R.R. Martins (as yet unwritten) final volume into three ""seasons"" each apportioned over the course of four years concluding in 2038 when the actor playing the pubescent Bran will be entering middle age.Which is a long way of saying that the decision to split the final Hunger Games novel--which is not appreciably longer than the first two--into a pair of movies smacks of imperatives more commercial than artistic. And yet on the basis of The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 1 its difficult to get too worked up about it. Is the film a bit baggy in places? Sure. Might it have been better if theyd squeezed the whole book into one movie? Probably. Nonetheless Mockingjay Part 1 is a fine entertainment shot through with moments of surprising emotional impact.Related Story Catching Fire A Leaner Hungrier Hunger Games The Hunger Games novels by Suzanne Collins went steadily downhill from the first to the third. As a writer she simply didnt have the chops to carry her story along as it became larger and more politically fraught. But the movies at least so far have followed a more impressive trajectory. The second installment was already weightier than the first and in this outing the moral gravity has been ratcheted up once more. The movies themes of rebellion and civil war are inherently cinematic ones and the filmmakers involved--returning director Francis Lawrence and new screenwriters Danny Strong and Peter Craig--lend the story a grim urgency largely lacking from the novel. Most crucial of all of course is Jennifer Lawrence who plays heroine Katniss Everdeen. Her Katniss-on-the-screen is so much richer and more compelling than Collinss Katniss-on-the-page that it almost seems as though shes playing another character altogether.The movie begins with Katniss hospitalized and traumatized. Rescued from her second Hunger Games at the end of the last movie she is now hidden away in the massive underground bunker of District 13 the heart of the rebellion against the nefarious Capitol. Alas the love of her life Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) was not rescued with her and Katniss is furious at his abandonment. She is also furious that the leaders of the rebellion--the chilly President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) and her cherubic spinmeister Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman)--want to enlist her as a propaganda vehicle for their cause. Eventually though she relents. As Heavensbee advises ""Theyll follow her. Shes the face of the rebellion.""At first this seems like a severe miscalculation as the rebels efforts to feature Katniss in a few in-studio propaganda videos (or ""propos"") call to mind nothing so much as ads for a third-tier congressional candidate. They have better luck however when they take her on location to another District devastated by the Capitol. There in what is probably Lawrences best scene her righteous anger is at last channeled toward a worthy cause. What follows is largely a propo-war in which the rebels broadcast on-the-ground videos of Katniss and the Capitol counters with chat-show interviews with a suddenly docile Peeta. (Has he been drugged? Tortured? Or is he playing a longer game?)Mockingjay Part 1 is the darkest entrant in the series to date visually as well as tonally. Director Lawrence (no relation to his star) presents his somber fable in shades of gray and brown. No one is primping for parades in the Capitol this time out nor modeling incendiary eveningwear. Even reluctant rebel Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) must make do without her elaborate wigs--instead she dons a Rosie-the-Riveter-esque scarf--and marzipan wardrobe. (""Now Im condemned to this life of jumpsuits"" she moans.) The dispute between the Capitol and its outlying districts has moved beyond its bread-and-circuses phase. And while Katnisss image is still being used for propaganda purposes her persona is no longer the lovestruck tribute but the combat-hardened veteran.Hoffmans understated performances in this film and the prior one gave both a touch of class.There are only a few battle sequences in the film but they are deployed effectively--in particular a brief uprising by lumberjacks that called to my mind the bamboo-forest battle in House of Flying Daggers. Im pretty sure that there was an echo of the U.S.S. Indianapolis speech from Jaws in the description of the survivors (""915 out of 10000"") of a massacre in District 12. And while Im probably wrong in also detecting a nod to All About Eve (""Take a deep breath Mr. Heavensbee. Its going to be a long night"") there are enough traces of nuance in the script that it seems at least a possibility.Moore is a strong addition to the cast as President Coin her shock of white hair suggesting that perhaps she is not quite so different from the Capitols diabolical President Snow (Donald Sutherland) as we might hope. Indeed with the exception of Sutherlands preening tyrant the entire cast has dialed down the hamminess of the earlier films from Bankss Effie to Stanley Tuccis Caesar Flickerman to Woody Harrelsons Haymitch Abernathy. Its as if they are all following the lead of Philip Seymour Hoffman whose understated performances in this film and the prior one gave both a touch of class. In Mockingjay Part 1 Hoffman tragically offers something else as well a reminder amid all the make-believe carnage and heartbreak of what genuine loss feels like.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

"The Revolution Will Be ... Prolonged The Enjoyable Frustrating Third Hunger Games Installment Mockingjay -- Part 1 << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com The Revolution Will Be ... Prolonged The Enjoyable Frustrating Third Hunger Games Installment Mockingjay -- Part 1 Murray Close/Lionsgate Movies November 21 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print There are cliffhangers and then theres what happens with the third and next-to-last Hunger Games installment Mockingjay -- Part 1. We dont even get to the cliff. Just as the revolution against the Capitol is about to get good here come the closing credits with a brand-new dirge from the movies soundtrack curator Lorde. Yes the reward for watching Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) tour one bombed-out district after the next for seeing her weep and mewl for piles of the dead and for her poor pretend paramour Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) is having to wait to see what it builds to. So much skill and craftsmanship and good writing and acting and costuming and production design go into this movie that it feels churlish to respond with resentment. But its possible -- perhaps even necessary -- to enjoy the movie and despise how abruptly it ends. The previous installment concluded with Katnisss discovery that a handful of other characters were actually revolutionaries from District 13 and that the Capitol had captured Peeta. That was a cliffhanger. Suzanne Collins wrote three books. Lionsgate is making four movies. The fourth will feature the oppressed storming the property of the oppressor President Snow (Donald Sutherland). Or one can only presume that will be the case. Whos to stop the studio from subdividing Mockingjay until it becomes a kind of Zenos paradox a math problem that never gets you to the Capitol? Things could be worse I suppose. These movies could be divided by the chapter. By the page They could be ... The Hobbit. Luckily theyre not. The Hunger Games has turned out to be the best of these so-called long-term franchises. The first movie was an incoherent dud but the second Catching Fire really did catch fire. This third movie is cooler but equally tense. You feel as if somethings at stake in this world. Collinss postapocalyptic dystopia called Panem represents different American regions -- Katniss and her family and friends are from a kind of coal-mining Appalachia -- that were carved up and are now run by Snows totalitarian regime. In the backstory these 13 districts united and failed to overthrow the central government which in punitive retaliation instituted the Hunger Games a televised reality-competition show in which two adolescents from each district fight to be the last person standing. In the first two movies Katniss merged on-the-ground cunning and media savvy to keep herself and her fellow District 12 entrant Peeta alive. The broadcast masterminds tried to use the two competitors affection for each other against them while also riveting the Panemanians at home. In this third movie the aboveground districts -- what remains of them -- have risen up gone on strike and are ready to attack. Revolution is a malleable concept especially in fiction. Novelists and filmmakers can be as abstract or as pointed as they like. The Hunger Games films iconography evokes slavery and Nazism but also a fractious era of dictatorship grotesque income inequality and an ambiguous seemingly unwinnable war. Almost any people with a boot on their neck and rifles strapped to their backs are represented among the citizens of Panem. President Snow tries to appeal to a socialist ideal ""To refuse to work is to put the entire system in peril."" No ones having it. But the people require a leader. District 13s President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) has been too cerebral to galvanize anyone. She accepts this and leans on Katniss to forget Peeta and assume the symbol of Panems struggle -- the mockingjay. These films appropriate the imagery and terminology of uprising and oppression but they go for a treatment thats not merely allegorical. In Mockingjay Katniss and her crew try but fail to stop the Capitol from destroying a packed hospital in a war-torn District 8. Feel free to confuse this movies District 13 with that other District 13 the brutalist one from that set of French action films (2004s District B13 and a 2009 sequel both Luc Besson productions) in which public-housing residents strike back against a government that wanted to bomb it to oblivion. In Mockingjay 13 is a literal underground movement so deep below the earths surface that shots of the vertical tunnels look as if they run laterally. The oppositions propaganda videos (propos theyre called) infiltrate the Capitol TV broadcasts which here consist mostly of the campy emcee Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci) turning a brainwashed Peeta into a lovelorn antirevolutionary peacenik. Wardrobe in these movies is a thing. Lenny Kravitz spends the first two movies as the shows clothier. Every time Peeta shows up in these junket interviews his short hair is blonder and hes wearing a little more makeup and a more outrageous outfit. One getup has origami jutting into his chin. ""Look at what theyve done to him"" Katniss cries. I know girl. Its Panem at the Disco Soon the lumbersexuals in District 7 are leaping up and into the treetops and commencing assault on the Capitol troops. Yes the relationship between freedom fighting and fashion seems dumb or glib. But these movies make it work in the Tim Gunn sense. Effie Trinket Katnisss flamboyant bewigged Capitol-born Hunger Games escort is played by Elizabeth Banks with a bitchy snobbish 1940s piquancy. Caught up in the District 13 uprising and cut off from her Capitol spoils she sulks in her drab shift dress and head scarf. The characters appearance evokes the ravages of both the concentration camp and the cancer ward as vividly as anything else in the movie. The presumed-to-be-villainous gamesmith Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman to whom the movies dedicated) appeals to Trinket to help get Katniss aboard the leadership train. ""Everything old can be made new"" Effie says with a mix of pain and belief. ""Like democracy."" Its a touchingly wishful thought from someone dressed like one of the Beale women from Grey Gardens.  Most of these science-fiction adventures involve someone ""chosen"" a golden child -- a boy its always a boy -- who was born to lead the masses to freedom. Some of the thrill of The Hunger Games movies is that youre watching a woman become a leader by dint of survival. Over and over Katniss volunteers herself and the people in turn fall for her. Lawrence didnt give off much in the first film. She got stronger as the second went along. Here she actually gets to build a full performance that incorporates steeliness and anguish and humor. As Katniss is forced to bear witness to one atrocity after the next Lawrences face is kept raw registering new horror for each image. A film crew follows her to each new obliterated district and captures her outrage and grief with the intent to propagandize it to rouse the people to action. (Natalie Dormer plays the propos director which gives Mockingjay its own Laura Poitras.) I cant think of another set of Hollywood movies as predicated on the emotional state of their protagonist. Tears rage and compassion here are proof of strength. (Theres a thick irony in having a world-class emoter like Moore play a commander whos too stoic to follow.) Freaking out here is a virtue that people are encouraged to trust. Its ridiculous to have to wait a year to reap the violent result of all that emotion. By virtue of its being the first of two parts Mockingjay cant take off and in order to lend the film the hope of duration it risks redundancy. If Katniss and the propos crew visit two demolished districts they visit 30. How can you like something that feels snatched away from you? This is a movie whose climax requires Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) to stall for time by talking into a camera for what feels like hours. Mockingjay has more exposition than a TED Talk more rubble than a decade of The Flintstones and absolutely no nonmonetary reason to be Part 1 of anything. It isnt storytelling. Its a filibuster.

Audiences will have to wait a year for this franchise to finish unless of course it racks up so many billions that the filmmakers decide to venture into Parts unknown.As it is ""Mockingjay"" a big bore suffers from being the transitional event before the big showdown. Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) awakens to confinement in an underground rebel hideaway in District 13 where she is enlisted initially unwillingly to become ""the face of the revolution"" by rebel President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) and Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman to whom the film is dedicated). She also discovers that her Hunger Games cohort Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) is alive and apparently brainwashed by Panems President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and his nefarious minions. Peeta is the anti-rebel to Katnisss Joan of Arc. As an actress Lawrence has grown beyond this sort of thing and the entire enterprise directed by Francis Lawrence feels like a massive placeholder for the grand finale.

Her favourite boyfriend Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) is missing. Her home district has been destroyed by President Snow (Donald Sutherland). And the rebel leaders are looking at her to save the world. Her squirrel-shooting days in the forest are long behind her. Video Video Jennifer Lawrence finds Hunger Games premiere unbelievable The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 1- The penultimate movie in the franchise doesnt come out until next month but a new trailer is sure to stoke fan interest. When Katniss sees what those jerks at the Capitol did to District 12 she is going to be so angry. (youtube.com) news Coming soon to a theatre in China Delays disappointments - but not Mockingjay The rebel leaders literally in the underground include the ice-in-her-veins President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) the Machiavellian propagandist Plutarch Heavensebee (the late Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Jeffrey Wright as the gruff technology genius Beetee which reminds us that whatever else you may fault about Hunger Games movies they dont stint on acting talent. The effect of so many Oscar-calibre actors speaking the generic dialogue is like watching pro ballplayers play T-ball.Together they are contriving to make Katniss as ""the face of the revolution"" a sort of Joan of Arc with warheads for arrows who can inspire the downtrodden people of Panem to rise in revolution. In the bunker which also doubles as a studio Heavensbee tries to direct staged video shoots where Katniss tries to sound inspiring but comes off as shrill and forced. A true rebel she cant fake it.Katniss finally breaks out of her performance block when her old mentor the newly sober Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) suggests they really need to capture her spontaneously for this to work. To that end he proposes they put her onto the battlefield. After witnessing Capitol planes bomb a hospital she expresses her rage and her accompanying documentary crew nails the the moment. Voila a viral video for the revolution.In fact the central conflict in the film is represented not with weapons but by duelling television broadcasts which go back and forth like siblings wrestling for the remote control. Early on Katniss learns that Peeta is alive living in the Capitol and has apparently betrayed her. He pops up in a series of televised interviews with the campy talk show host Caesar (Stanley Tucci) urging the rebels to lay down their arms. Her confusion and pining for Peeta leaves poor Gale (Liam Hemsworth) now a rebel soldier to pout in rejection.At about the movies halfway point Lawrence sitting on a romantic mountaintop huskily croaks out a song called The Hanging Tree. The tune turns into a surprising revolutionary chorus and sets us up for the movies final showdown.But wait. And then wait again until November 2015 when The Hunger Games trilogy will reach its real conclusion.Mockingjay - Part 1 is too familiar to be a genuine disappointment. Weve seen this gambit before with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 and Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 1 movies that were stretched into two parts to maximize profits. If it helps you could think of it as one movie with a year-long washroom break.The narrative padding is mostly in the form of belaboured backroom planning and what might generously be called satire if YA fiction is where you look for media insight. Otherwise theres some maturity here. The child-on-child killing of the first two films has been replaced by a more familiar kinds of violence There are montages of an ISIS-like public execution of hooded prisoners; a Zero Dark Thirty-style special ops night raid on the Capitol; a suicide raid against soldiers dressed up like Star Wars stormtroopers.But that makes Hunger Games 2.5 sound more politically trenchant and action-packed than it is. Truth is Mockingjay - Part 1 looks depressing full of rubbled landscapes and parking garage interiors and prison uniform functionality. ""Im condemned to this life of jump suits"" says Effie (Elizabeth Banks) the former Capitol fashion plate who now finds herself down in the hole with the rest of the revolutionaries. Perhaps more than any other character you feel her pain.No doubt the grimness is calculated or perhaps over-calculated. The first Hunger Games movie began as a rustic medieval fairy tale; the second involved an end-of-an-empire world of flamboyant decadence; and now Mockingjay immerses us in totalitarian-grey concrete walls and backroom strategy meetings.That makes Mockingjay - Part 1 an experience to be endured like a prison sentence rather than enjoyed. By all means bring on the revolution It has to be more exciting than this.

There is no triumphant moment. All is frustration and indecision inaction and waiting. There is very little fire of any kind.All of which makes ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 1"" a more difficult and in some ways interesting movie than its predecessors. Based on the first half of the concluding novel of the ""Hunger Games"" trilogy -- major liberties have been taken with story and characters -- its a bridge movie that offers no climactic conclusions yet raises major questions.The biggest of which is are there any truly good guys in war? Is there any winning? Oppression is clearly evil but arent victors inherently oppressors?Asking or at least thinking these questions is our heroine Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence terrific as always). She ended her second Hunger Games by destroying the game stadium itself then was rescued and brought to safe haven in District 13 which turns out to be a militaristic society housed deep underground just waiting to lash out at the ruling Capitol and its President Snow (the sublimely snakey Donald Sutherland).Katniss partner and possible love Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) is held captive in the Capitol; indeed hes being brainwashed into spouting anti-rebel propaganda over the airwaves. Her hunting partner and possible love alternate Gale (Liam Hemsworth) has taken refuge in District 13 and is adopting its soldierly demeanor.Those in power -- mainly District 13s icy President Coin (Julianne Moore) and retired gamemaster Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) -- have a plan They want to promote Katniss already the symbol of rebellion as the figurehead of a coming revolution.Katniss mainly wants to get Peeta out of captivity. But she agrees to star in videos to bolster the growing fight. Problem is Katniss loses all her spark and believability when shes just reading lines. So she is sent out with a camera crew led by film director Cressida (Natalie Dormer) to interact with troops on the ground in what turns out to be the films one big action scene. Katniss of course sizzles when confronted with real action.But again real action isnt what this films about (the final ""Mockingjay"" if it lives up to the book should be downright breathless in comparison). Its about a confused and frightened young woman forced into situations decisions and even bonds not of her own making. ""The Hunger Games"" greatest strength is that even though its protagonist is awfully good with an arrow and even an impassioned speech she -- like most teens if not most people -- is generally unsure of herself romantically politically and socially. Shes just a kid.""Mockingjay - Part 1"" is substantially shorter than its predecessors at a little over two hours and fans of the novel will still note some padding. Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) has a place at the table in District 13; and a mission to rescue Peeta which is fairly invisible in the novel here becomes a major action piece. Note to director Francis Lawrence Major action pieces should always involve Katniss. Without her this looks like a ""Mission Impossible"" outtake.With all the question marks hovering and no defined ending ""Mockingjay - Part 1"" however well done cant compete with the first two films although it sets up what should be its stunning ending well enough.

By CHRIS VOGNAR Follow chrisvognar cvognardallasnews.com Culture Critic Published 20 November 2014 0840 PM Updated 20 November 2014 0908 PM Related Citizenfour goes inside the mind motives of Edward Snowden (B+) Ill Be Me is a moving farewell to legend Glen Campbell Low Down is a portrait painted with love and pain (B+) All-star comedy Reach Me feels overstuffed uneven (D) The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 1 is by definition a placeholder movie the front half of a fiction franchise finale cloven in two for the big screen.The math behind this is pretty simple Two separate releases equals two different sets of grosses equals more money for Lionsgate the happy Hunger distributor. The box-office odds are ever in the studios favor.Once you accept that the splitting of Mockingjay is a business decision not a dramatic imperative Part 1 comes off as a curiously satisfying nonaction movie. The fireworks will go off next time. This time we get a carefully dissected buildup to war a messy proposition in any circumstances dystopian or not. As a study in political sales craft Mockingjay knows exactly what its doing. If that doesnt get your young heart racing well wait til next November when Part 2 rolls around.Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) has thrown a wrench into the Games and been ensconced in District 13 where shes asked to foment and become the face of a revolution plotted by President Coin (Julianne Moore cool and restrained) and Plutarch Heavensbee (the late Philip Seymour Hoffman). She still pines for Peeta (Josh Hutcherson given less to do this time around) but sometimes a girl has to put love on the back burner and save the world.Or at least shoot some 30-second ad spots for destroying an oppressive government. The Hunger Games franchise has always generated a spark of intelligence by creating friction with the real world. Here we see how a PR campaign for war is put together. Canned spots wont do. The burgeoning revolution complete with documentary crew needs to film Katniss in the field where she can show her real fire. Her home district reduced to rubble she snarls for the camera and stays on message. Karl Rove and James Carville would be proud.Director Francis Lawrence creates a mood of tense anticipation (good practice for the next year of waiting) and envelops his characters in clouds of shadow that would make the late Gordon Willis a cinematographer nicknamed the Prince of Darkness stand up and cheer. Theres an apocalyptic somberness to Mockingjay -- Part 1 the quiet before the storm on the way.As usual for this series theres also a lot of good acting. In one early scene Lawrence sits down for a strategy conference with Hoffman Moore and Jeffrey Wright who plays the revolutions tech wizard. Here are four top-flight performers one sadly no longer with us deftly selling us genre fare as serious drama. That kind of thing sets a tone that has lifted the Hunger franchise above its ilk from the start.Lawrence remains the standout. Her range and conviction allow Katniss to emerge as both a fierce warrior and a conflicted young woman. One moment shes shooting down warplanes with explosive arrows. The next shes flickering a flashlight for a cats amusement. Whats next for our mockingjay? You could read the book and find out. Or you can wonder until oh about a year from now.THE HUNGER GAMES MOCKINGJAY -- PART 1 (B+)Directed by Francis Lawrence.

"Hunger Games The Mockingjay - Part 1 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; hunger-games-the-mockingjay-part-1 ) Hunger Games The Mockingjay - Part 1 (United States 2014) November 20 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Apologists will no doubt argue that bifurcating Suzanne Collins final novel in The Hunger Games cycle Mockingjay is the right way to go. Theres no doubt that stretching it over 4+ hours allows for a more complete adaptation but movies are different beasts from books and this luxury damages the narrative thrust and throttles the pacing. Neither of these flaws is fatal but Mockingjay - Part 1 is easily the weakest of the three The Hunger Games films to reach theaters thus far. (As always with divided films my overall opinion may change once the entire thing is available and can be seen in a single seating.) Mockingjay - Part 1 is the darkest chapter of The Hunger Games saga - a departure in many ways from the action/adventure flavor of the previous two installments The Hunger Games and Catching Fire. The pacing is more deliberate but thats as much a result of the text as it is the expansion of the material. Whats missing from Mockingjay - Part 1 is a strong through-story. The previous films were characterized by engrossing well-constructed story arcs but Mockingjay - Part 1 meanders. Most of the running length is devoted to set-up and when the finale arrives the movie doesnt really end; it just stops. Mockingjay - Part 1 picks up shortly after the end of Catching Fire which saw Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Finnick (Sam Claflin) being rescued from the latest games by a band of rebels and revealed that Katniss home district had been leveled by bombers sent by President Snow (Donald Sutherland). Now afflicted with PTSD and obsessed with whether her partner and love interest Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) is alive she has become listless and uncommunicative. The District 12 refugees including Katniss family and old ""friends"" Effie (Elizabeth Banks) and Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) are living in the secret military bunker of District 13 which is run by President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) with an assist from Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman). President Coin wants to use Katniss for propaganda purposes - call her the ""Mockingjay"" and turn her into a rallying point for rebellion across all the districts. To be part of this Katniss demands concessions the biggest one of which is that Peeta who is alive and making pro-Capitol broadcast appearances be rescued and given a pardon. President Coin agrees and Katniss becomes a figurehead for the dissidents. In that role she sees firsthand how ruthless President Snow can be. This is the first The Hunger Games movie not to chronicle an iteration of the duel-to-the-death title match. Mockingjay - Part 1 is more character-based and focuses on the consequences of starting an uprising against a totalitarian regime. To its credit the movie doesnt soft-pedal things. There are no ""rah rah"" moments. This is as grim as PG-13 can get; the darkness is comparable to that of The Empire Strikes Back. When the film arrives at its cliffhanger conclusion theres a sense of profound frustration regarding the mandatory 12-month hiatus before the rest of the story can be told. (For that reason Im tempted to recommend skipping Mockingjay - Part 1 in theaters and seeing it on video once Mockingjay - Part 2 has been released.) Jennifer Lawrence (wearing a wig thats as bad as William Shatners 1980s toupees) gets to take Katniss in new directions revealing a fractured conflicted personality. Other familiar faces have returned although some like Elizabeth Banks Effie and Woody Harrelsons Haymitch are subdued. Jeffrey Wright once again plays egghead Beetee; theres a scene in which he offers an homage to the James Bond series Q. Newcomers include Julianne Moore Alma Coin the leader of District 13 and would-be president of all Panem and Game of Thrones Natalie Dormer as Cressida the ""director"" of the propaganda films focused on Katniss. With darkness impinging on all aspects of the story theres little time for the love triangle between Katniss Peeta and Liam Hemsworths Gale Hawthorne to move forward. The kiss shared by Katniss and Gale lacks any semblance of emotion and the physical distance between Katniss and Peeta is an impediment. The romance has always been The Hunger Games least compelling aspect (it may have been shoehorned into the books because of genre reader expectations); downplaying it is not a detriment. More of the move/countermove games between the Capitol and the rebels would have elevated the stakes. Until late in the proceedings theres not much suspense. Before Part 2 is released its difficult to assign a final ""grade"" to Mockingjay - Part 1. As a stand-alone its worthwhile especially for fans. It advances the story expands the character arcs and introduces some daring elements. But it is in no way a complete movie in the traditional sense. As a result Part 2 will determine whether Mockingjay soars or crashes to the blasted dystopian earth with a thud.

"Review Oh Hunger Games Mockingjay 1 the suspense is killing us - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 1 is just a place-holder The Hunger Games MockingJay Part 1 Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews The Hunger Games MockingJay Part 1 Starring Jennifer Lawrence Josh Hutcherson Liam Hemsworth. Video by Jason H. Neubert Kenneth Turan reviews The Hunger Games MockingJay Part 1 Starring Jennifer Lawrence Josh Hutcherson Liam Hemsworth. Video by Jason H. Neubert Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Katniss is back in fighting form. But you already know youll leave this film with unresolved feelings Director Peter Jackson was in the room with New Line Cinema founder Bob Shaye back in 1998 or so the story goes pitching him on making J.R.R. Tolkiens ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy into a pair of films when Shaye stopped him with a question ""Why make two films when you can make three?""Fast-forward to today when not only do trilogies like the ""Divergent"" series routinely get three films but single novels if they conclude a popular series like the Harry Potter or ""Twilight"" books get split into two parts with the potential for increased earnings that motivated Shaye still a key driving force. As its elaborate title indicates ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 1"" is the latest franchise film to have taken the ""Lord of the Rings"" model to heart. Though everyone tries her or his hardest to make it otherwise this is by definition a place-holder film that exists not so much for itself but to smooth the transition from its hugely successful predecessors to a presumably glorious finale one year hence.While its unlikely that anyone who hasnt seen the previous films will be motivated to start here the hordes already pulling for the redoubtable Katniss Everdeen will be hard to keep away. Sticking closely to the plotting of novelist Suzanne Collins (who gets an adaptation credit here) director Francis Lawrence delivers on what dramatic beats half a novel affords him. You just wish there were more of them and that they provided a more complete more satisfying story arc. ""Mockingjay"" does benefit from the return of most of the cast from those earlier films notably Jennifer Lawrence as unquenchable flame Katniss whose dramatically shot arrow at the close of ""Catching Fire"" literally and figuratively breaks a glass ceiling assembled by the carefully regimented totalitarian future state of Panem. Hunger Games Mockingjay director on Jennifer Lawrence and Philip Seymour Hoffman Gina McIntyre Gina McIntyre Lawrence whos been nominated for three Oscars and won once (for ""Silver Linings Playbook"") maintains her tight hold on the fierce character of Katniss a rebel by instinct who insists always on being defiantly her own person.One reason the ""Hunger Games"" trilogy was so successful in print (more than 65 million copies in the U.S. alone) is the shrewd way the plot combines the personal and the political intertwining a kind of ""High School Confidential"" romantic triangle with serious bread and circuses concerns about spectacle tyranny and the manipulation of public opinion. The cast of ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 1"" travels the world to promote the third film in a four-film franchise. Here are a few snapshots. (Nardine Saad) Written this time by Peter Craig and Danny Strong ""Mockingjay"" opens where ""Catching Fire"" ended with Katniss having just been plucked from the Quarter Qwell arena. Shes been told that her actions have been the spark that has inspired a nascent rebellion against the totalitarian system run with evil efficiency by the way-devious President Snow (Donald Sutherland.) Katniss now finds herself in the militarized underground city that is the headquarters of the revolt the super-secret District 13 under the command of steely President Coin (Julianne Moore new to the series).Coins prime strategist is none other than Plutarch Heavensbee (the late Philip Seymour Hoffman) the former games maker himself. He and President Coin want Katniss to become the face of their rebellion to help them unite the put-upon Districts against the dread Capitol. ""To start a revolution we need a voice"" shes told and she is the consensus pick.Katniss being Katniss is not so sure. For one thing she is worried sick about one of her beaus her Hunger Games partner Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) whos a prisoner in the Capitol. Perhaps under duress of some sort hes turning out the kind of anti-revolt propaganda that makes him persona non grata in District 13.Though she doesnt say so explicitly we can tell that Katniss is not sure how far Plutarch and President Coin can be trusted. As someone who acts from the gut she is ill at ease with the calculation of her new colleagues even though she shares their disgust at President Snows depredations. You can almost hear the ""meet the new boss/same as the old boss"" lyrics of the Whos ""Wont Get Fooled Again"" going through her mind.Helping Katniss calm down is the presence of her other beau the hunky Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth) now a District 13 soldier and old colleagues from the games. Back in business is futuristic fashionista Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) determined to make Katniss ""the best-dressed rebel in history"" and her old mentor Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson at his relaxed best) now clean and sober albeit much against his will.Because this is the first Hunger Games movie without any actual game action in it ""Mockingjay"" is often slow going with not enough strong emotional moments (the one exception is Katniss visiting a rebel hospital) to compensate.Plus having the film end at a particularly dramatic en media res moment only underscores how frustrating it is to have to wait a whole year for the conclusion. If its going to be true as someone predicts to Katniss that everyone in Panem is ""going to want to kiss you kill you or be you"" it hardly seems fair to have to wait so long for all of the above to happen.kenneth.turanlatimes.com------------""The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 1.""MPAA rating PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action some disturbing images and thematic materialRunning time 2 hours 3 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Reviews Trailer The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 1 Hunger Games soundtrack leaves listeners sated The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 1 poised for biggest 2014 debut Hunger Games soundtrack leaves listeners sated At Mockingjay premiere glitz and glamour among the ruins Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad81deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-hunger-games-mockingjay-review-20141121-column.html,200,thehungergamesmockingjay-part111,thehungergamesmockingjay-part1,latimes

Murray Close/Lions Gate hide caption toggle caption Murray Close/Lions Gate Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen. Murray Close/Lions Gate When producers were laying track for the Hunger Games series years ago they couldnt have foreseen how discomforting author Suzanne Collins descriptions of a war-torn authoritarian state would look on the big screen in 2014. In The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part One Jennifer Lawrence witnesses and/or learns of towns reduced to rubble refugee camps next to mass graves public executions of innocents with burlap sacks over their heads law enforcement gunning down protesters in the street and a military bombing a hospital filled with civilians. All of these images have resonance in real events of this year generations before Collins predicted civilization would devolve into a regime that maintains control over its citizens with televised death matches. The series has always evoked real geopolitics but the earlier films offset those with self-parody an abundance of purple hair and oily camera-ready suits an outlandish imperial march composed by Arcade Fire. This playfulness is absent from Mockingjay which is laser-focused on the land of Panem quashing dissent by any means necessary. Its not that the film is ""too dark for kids"" -- that would drastically underestimate teenagers capabilities for darkness. Its that this degree of nastiness doesnt square with the empty-calories action scenes of the first two films where nothing that happened in the Hunger Games arenas (Look out Wild monkeys) seemed to impact the overall story. But maybe its a good thing to be more serious this time even if the progression wasnt gradual. ""A little on-the-nose but of course so is war"" remarks the dearly departed Philip Seymour Hoffman playing an architect of the Panem resistance movement. Hes referring to a tweak hes made to a rally song but he could also be discussing Mockingjay itself how a mass appeal sci-fi franchise chooses its war imagery. In a film about the role that visual communication plays in public opinion the on-the-nose approach is at once intriguing and exhausting. Strange to think this series used to be about archery in the wilderness. That anyway is where fiery revolutionary Katniss Everdeen (Lawrence) was at the conclusion of the previous film 2013s Catching Fire. Rejecting societys pressure to kill her friends for amusement a second time Katniss instead shot a hole in the sky through which she has been whisked away to the super-secret underground rebel stronghold District 13. In the first two films Katniss was a pawn of Panems dastardly white-bearded President Snow (Donald Sutherland forever sneering). Sadly shes still a pawn but of a nobler president the benevolent but still white-haired District 13 leader Alma Coin (Julianne Moore a hair too robotic). Coin needs Katniss to be her ""Mockingjay"" a symbol around which to mobilize the citizens of Panem a warrior whos no-nonsense yet down-to-earth. In short she needs Katniss to be Jennifer Lawrence. Until now the biggest strength of the Hunger Games series has been the careful construction of Panem a dystopia-lovers utopia. All the details from the first two entries were rich in cinematic absurdity like the party where the rich gladly vomit up their food or the gaudy stage sets that accompany Stanley Tuccis gleeful talk show host as he conducts cloying interviews with Games candidates. Having to trade such an expansive setting for a drafty underground bunker (District 13 must be sharing the lease with the Zion rebels from the Matrix sequels) is the weakest part of Mockingjay along with Katniss friend-and-maybe-more Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and his mopey ""I have feelings too"" jealousy. Theres also no escaping the fact that this film co-written by Collins and two others is a stopgap designed to string audiences along one year more than the source material requires. The artificial division of a narrative for the sole purpose of making money should not normally be cause for a creative success. But somehow chopping up Mockingjay a practice that has become the norm with final installments of YA series adaptations created some happy accidents. With less material than in Catching Fire director Francis Lawrence is free to be contemplative edit sequences patiently instead of frantically and linger over small visual details like a speck of blood on Snows cheek after his groomer cuts his face shaving. And Jennifer Lawrence has the freedom to interact with each of her allies in more subtle ways practiced patience with Elizabeth Banks fallen fashion maven Effie; steely distrust with Woody Harrelsons rakish mentor Haymitch; sheer annoyance with her cat. Josh Hutcherson a bit wooden in the other films is also doing something fascinating as Peeta Katniss on-camera boyfriend who was captured by Panems Capitol at the conclusion of Catching Fire. For much of Mockingjay we see him only via the Capitols authorized interviews saying questionable things about the revolution. Like Katniss we can only guess at his current state of mind. Hutchersons strong subtle performance lets us read any number of possibilities in his face and minimal line readings. Thats until the very end when he turns chilling. If any of this felt like Hobbiting -- defined as the practice of throwing useless fan-serving footage onscreen to bloat up a blockbuster franchise -- thered be a problem. But Mockingjay doesnt have that vibe because it follows one unmistakable theme from beginning to end an information war. Instead of physically dueling Katniss and the Capitol fling propaganda films like projectile bombs. The chess match of public opinion is a colder more calculated game than the testing of wilderness survival skills. Katniss reluctant viral video star hilariously fumbles her lines when shes in front of a green screen leading the CGI army from a Ridley Scott movie. But she draws tears when a tattooed documentarian (Game of Thrones Natalie Dormer who could have stepped out of a Copenhagen artists co-op) films her examining the rubble of her childhood home. Its the latter footage the on-the-nose war stuff that drives Panem to rebel rather than change the channel to Where Are My Pants? Collins and the Lawrences have crossed the uncanny valley separating imagined dystopia from actual horrors but theyre also delivering a life lesson in cinema to teens Things are stronger when they look real. Think about that when the Capitol beams out the next all-CGI superhero movie.

The greedy suits have made two movies out of the last book in the bestselling Hunger Games trilogy because well they can divide and conquer by suckering us to pay twice for the same thing. Hell the Harry Potter movies did it. Twilight did it. And Hollywood will keep on doing it until the golden goose gets vain about its stretch marks and stops laying golden eggs. More News Fall Movie Preview Finally the Good Stuff Jennifer Lawrence Gets Badass in New Hunger Games Trailer Hunger Games Victory Rings Hollow for Katniss in Clip Lorde Shares Alluring New Single Yellow Flicker Beat All Stories >> On the bright side The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part I comes out blazing. How could it not? Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence suited up again as the heroic Katniss Everdeen is a firebrand for the ages. Returning director Francis Lawrence (no relation) working from a script by series newbies Peter Craig and Danny Strong delivers the dazzle without sacrificing the smarts. The suspense is killer. Ditto the thrill of the hunt. The film uses the extra time to of all things develop characters and give this dystopian fable a human scale. Non-readers of author Suzanne Collins young-adult trilogy will be shocked to learn that there are no Hunger Games in this Hunger Games. The organized televised Olympic-like events in which young hotties annually fight to the death to delight the debauched audiences in the big bad Capitol of Panem are no more. President Snow (Donald Sutherland with a sneer that wont quit) must find another way to quash the 12 districts that rebelled against him. Katniss is badly shaken. Her home in District 12 has been obliterated. Her mother (Paula Malcomson) and sister (Willow Shields) are missing. Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) her stylist made the kill list. Her BFF Peeta (the ever-cheeky Josh Hutcherson) a love rival to homeboy Gale (Liam Hemsworth) has been kidnapped and maybe executed. And thats what you missed in The Hunger Games Catching Fire. If you skipped or blanked on the first Games as well prepare for a ""wait what?"" reaction to match that moment in Interstellar when Matthew McConaughey enters the space-time continuum. Patina Miller Liam Hemsworth Mahershala Ali Jennifer Lawrence and Elden Henson in The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 1. Murray Close Luckily Mockingjay -- Part 1 powers through on the strength of a tale thats always had more on the ball than the shoddy Games rip-offs (thats you Divergent). Katniss has been called to the underground District 13 to become the living embodiment of the Mockingjay the bird that symbolizes revolt. Rebel leader Coin (Julianne Moore) doubts that Katniss has the cojones. But her wingman Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) begs to differ. On the advice of the suddenly sober Haymitch (Woody Harrelson in full mischief mode) Katniss is deemed a disaster reading scripted lines for propaganda videos or ""propos."" Off she goes to real war zones with Cressida (a sly Natalie Dormer from Game of Thrones) a videographer skilled at finding the inner Joan of Arc in Katniss. Making Katniss a star isnt much of a sweat not with Lawrence in the role. At 24 she already ranks with the top talents of her generation. Beetee (Jeffrey Wright) builds Katniss three arrows for her bow regular incendiary and explosive. Lawrence can match that and raise the ante. She makes us feel every jab as Katniss reacts to Peetas alleged betrayal and her own fury at the Capitols terrorist tactics. ""If we burn you burn with us"" she shouts. OK theres less action in Games this time but whats there is prime. And the acting is aces. Cheers to Elizabeth Banks for adding humor and heart to Effie Trinket the fashionista chaperone now bereft of the wigs makeup and accessories that make life bearable. The Hunger Games has always attracted A-team actors. Moore is superb at suggesting the secrets buried in Coin as she plans a revolution beyond the reach of Katniss. And Hoffman in a final performance to be completed in Mockingjay -- Part 2 due next November goes beyond the call of franchise duty to find the bruised soul in a master manipulator. ""Anyone can be replaced"" his character announces at one point. Not this consummate actor. Seeing him go out with such playful panache is one of the unalloyed joys of Mockingjay -- Part 1.

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 217pm on Thursday Nov. 20 2014 Thursday Nov. 20 2014 Thursday Nov. 20 2014 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 1 the first installment in the last chapter of the popular franchise is all coil and no release. Its a taut dark portrait of a universe upended by revolution one where the flashy bread-and-circuses of the first two films have been replaced by anger and despair.If its more talky and less satisfying than its predecessor the propulsive The Hunger Games Catching Fire -- largely because the conclusion wont come until next year with Part 2 -- its still a sporadically involving adventure.As the movie opens the nation of Panem -- the future country where the story takes place -- is in an uproar. In the wake of the act of defiance at the end of Catching Fire from Hunger Games champ Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and her well-placed arrow everything is falling apart. The districts where the working-class and the poor are consigned are in revolt. District 12 from which Everdeen hails has been destroyed. Even the Capitol the elite beating heart of an evil empire that forces its young people to compete in its deadly hunger games is in trouble.Katniss has been taken in by rebels in District 13 including President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) and gamesmaker Plutarch Heavensbee (the late Philip Seymour Hoffman) from the last film who turned out to be a radical in establishment disguise. Their mission is to rain down blows against the empire though Katniss has her own personal mission of trying to save her fellow tribute and games partner Peeta Melark (Josh Hutcherson) someone she grew to love. He remains in the Capitol and is being used by the government in a media propaganda war against those involved in the rebellion including Katniss. She thinks hes being forced into being a mouthpiece; others such as her old friend Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth) think he has just sold out.Its this tug of war between the Capitol run by the always-plotting President Coriolanus Snow (Donald Sutherland) and the upstarts in District 13 that gives Mockingjay its tension. Unlike the previous two films where the running of the games provided much of the momentum there isnt much action in The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 1. Still the plot machinations promise things will get back to good old mano a mano in the next film.Working from a script by Peter Craig and Danny Strong director Francis Lawrence who directed Catching Fire but not the first movie manages to keep things moving. And there are moments that rise above being a mere setup a rebel incursion into a darkened Capitol in which our heroes descend like fireflies against a black sky is intriguingly suspenseful while the issues of political control and media manipulation -- at one point rebels are executed after having hoods placed over their heads -- bear obvious correlations to our own world.Lawrence delivers her best ""Games"" performance here as Katniss struggles to make the transition from player to power broker from a woman who cant bear to leave her boyfriend behind to fronting an uprising. And make no mistake this is Lawrences movie even more than the other films.Providing what few hints of comic relief there are is Elizabeth Banks as the formerly flamboyant Effie Trinket the woman who was the overly stylish chaperone for the District 12 games players. Now living in the more austere and spartan surroundings of District 13 -- where Katniss boozy mentor Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) bemoans the lack of alcohol -- Effie can only dream of her previous sartorial glories.But her fashion options fit Mockingjays mood -- gray and grim. For the next film she and the audience could do with a pop of color. Cary Darling 817-390-7571 Twitter carydar Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

Comments click to enlarge The Hunger Games Mockingjay--Part 1 Rated PG-13  123 minutes  2014 Likely the most self-reflexive blockbuster of 2014 this third installment of the Hunger Games series considers the creation of mass spectacle and how different groups employ the same showbiz tactics to advance different political aims. The story finds Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) once the pawn in a dystopian governments propaganda spectacle joining forces with a revolutionary army which turns her into the mascot of their rebellion. Its remarkably cynical for a movie aimed at young adult audiences presenting both politicians and revolutionaries as hypocrites more concerned with public image and consolidating power than with politics. The cynicism is never really convincing though since the filmmakers are in the business of creating mass spectacle themselves. In any case the impressive supporting cast (which features Philip Seymour Hoffman Julianne Moore Jeffrey Wright and Woody Harrelson) keeps this highly watchable. Francis Lawrence directed.

"Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 1 The story splinters but the camera never blinks review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesHunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 1 The story splinters but the camera never blinks reviewMuch of the first part of Mockingjay the latest sequel to The Hunger Games is devoted to setting up the second part due out in 2015. By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Nov. 20 2014The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 1Starring Jennifer Lawrence Josh Hutcherson Julianne Moore Philip Seymour Hoffman Woody Harrelson Elizabeth Banks and Liam Hemsworth. Directed by Francis Lawrence. At GTA theatres. 123 minutes. PGAs the awkward title implies theres a riot of things happening in The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 1.There are also a lot of things not quite happening.Article Continued BelowThis third film of the sci-fi adventure franchise starring Jennifer Lawrence as reluctant fight-or-die survivalist Katniss Everdeen has reached the point -- attained earlier by the Harry Potter and Twilight properties -- where commercial storytelling turns to pure greed.Jennifer Lawrence once again portrays Katniss Everdeen in the latest Hunger Games installment The Hunger Games Mockinjay - Part 1.  (Murray Close / The ASsociated Press)  While the first two Hunger Games movies tracked events in the first two books of the Suzanne Collins dystopian novel trilogy the Mockingjay movies (Part 2 is due a year hence) cleave the final tome into separate but not equal halves.And not in a great way since so much of Mockingjay -- Part 1 is devoted to setting up Mockingjay -- Part 2. But theres enough here to at least keep fans of the series involved and eagerly awaiting the grand finale.If theres a single big victory in this claustrophobic jumble of a film its convincing us that the series is worth keeping up with.Directed by the returning Francis Lawrence from a screenplay by Peter Craig and Danny Strong and titled for the hybrid chattering bird that becomes a symbol of rebellion for the oppressed people of fictional Panem Mockingjay -- Part 1 picks up from where Catching Fire ended last year.It also shifts gears from the survival game motif of the previous films while employing a palette of dreary shades of grey. Katniss awakens in District 13 the hidden outpost of rebels determined to stop the fascistic rule of President Snow (a majestically evil Donald Sutherland) who inhabits the Oz-like city called the Capitol.There she meets a host of new characters among them resistance leader President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore in silver-toned long locks) District 13 security chief Boggs (Mahershala Ali from House of Cards) and a documentary/propaganda film crew led by the punk-coiffed Cressida (Natalie Dormer from Game of Thrones).Katniss reconnects with evolving past characters her District 12 BFF/boy-toy Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth) her newly sober mentor Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) gamesmaker/strategist Plutarch Heavensbee (the late Philip Seymour Hoffman) ace hacker Beetee (Jeffrey Wright) and games escort/comic relief Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks).The fate of Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) her MIA Games co-winner and official boyfriend is teased out in a way that befits the media-manipulation theme of The Hunger Games something that keeps this franchise from getting too stale.Katniss is no longer a TV contestant who must amuse the masses with her struggles. Attired in drop-dead black body armour (""Everyones going to want to kiss you kill you or be you"" Effie coos) shes now a full-on warrior.Shes also the official face of the growing rebellion a mantle she has reluctantly assumed ""I never asked for this.""As such she needs to motivate the huddled masses of Panem by making inspirational videos that look for all the world like trailers for the very movie were watching.Katniss fights a couple of real battles including one where a hospital is attacked by the increasingly determined and violent forces of President Snow. She also makes an emotional visit to what remains of District 12 which has been flattened by government guns and bombs.The film works as well as it does thanks to the still-potent acting of Lawrence even though shes more of a re-actor than actor this time out.Like the defiant bird she symbolizes Katniss needs to be set free not cooped up the way she is for much of the movie.The story recognizes this and plays with it. When Katniss first starts making propaganda videos using green-screen technology in a studio theres an awareness both on and off the screen that shes faking it.She opts to tape messages out in the battlefield while the Capitol wages war prompting this worried question from a handler ""And if youre killed?""""Make sure you get it on camera"" Katniss replies uttering the definitive statement in this most media-savvy of movie franchises.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Updated July 30 2016  1153 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movie reviews Third Hunger Games makes a political point By Joe Williams / Film critic / joewilliamspost-dispatch.com Joe Williams Nov 20 2014 (...) After three movies the message finally strikes like an arrow ""The Hunger Games"" is a political allegory. And Katniss Everdeen is no Tea Partier.In ""Mockingjay -- Part 1"" the penultimate film of the series Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence growing stronger with each installment) awakens from a daze and dons battle fatigues to fight the power in the Capitol. (Note to author Suzanne Collins and the movies art department ""capital"" is spelled with two As unless youre talking about a domed building.)On the receiving end of her wrath are the fat cats who sent starving citizens like herself and true love Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) into the gladiatorial ring for the winner-take-all Hunger Games. Now Peeta seems to be a sell-out spouting propaganda for ultra-white President Snow (Donald Sutherland) on Panems nationwide video feed. So Katniss is enlisted by renegade TV producer Plutarch Heavensbee (the late Philip Seymour Hoffman) and rebel leader Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) to rally the rural troops.Yet in a promising twist the rebels are just as obsessed with staged messages as the mainstream media in the Capitol (embodied by Stanley Tucci as Hunger Games host Caesar Flickerman). And we almost feel sorry for carefully coiffed Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) when she becomes a wigless prisoner of the rebel army.As with ""Harry Potter"" ""Twilight"" and other boffo film franchises the last book in the series has been needlessly divided into two movies. So weve got a full year to guess whether its really revolutionary or marching toward some middle ground between Marxism and merchandising.

December 16 2014 -- 341pm Video (0159)  ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 1"" is the third of four ""Hunger Games"" movies. David Brewster Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert After its first two terrific installments the newest edition of ""The Hunger Games"" left me hungry like a feast thats stunningly prepared but flavorless and non-nutritious. I think ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 1"" delivered a dab of stomach acid too. ""Mockingjay"" is an extra-desolate chapter in the ongoing story more a setup for 2015s real finale than a complete chapter on its own. A minor work on a major scale it moves its heroine Katniss Everdeen from the strong brave compassionate female superhero of the future into regular-person territory. In the first two films she faced awful emotional crises but kept a stiff upper lip and fought back. Here shes introduced in a crying fit and returns there repeatedly like the emotion-pained protagonist of a young-love novel. For those new to the futuristic franchise Katniss (an extra-youthful looking Jennifer Lawrence) is a teen daughter of North Americas coal mining District 12. The dystopian nation of Panem dominates every poor region ethnicity and culture outside of the master race the ultrawealthy residents of the Capitol. Those who were oppressed failed to take action for nearly a century being frightened into submission by the leaders annual TV pageant of deadly youth combat the Hunger Games. When her child-age sister was about to be drafted into the next bloodletting contest Katniss volunteered to take her place. She and her partner Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) forced to fake a romance for the Capitols TV broadcasts fell in love for real when her skills as a woodland bow hunter brought them to unexpected victory. They became honest televised heroes deeply appealing to the rising revolutionary masses. She destroyed the Games and was rescued from the wreckage. He was taken hostage by the Capitol. Now Katniss slides from a woman who takes control of crises to a woman in despair. She lives in the underground bomb shelter of District 13s military insurgents who want to exploit her powers as a revered video propaganda star. Meanwhile Peeta is doing near-identical broadcasts for demonically evil President Snow (Donald Sutherland) uttering messages about the futility of war designed to silence his faraway sweetheart. It feels like half the film is about people watching screens. Murray Close Associated Press - Ap In this image released by Lionsgate Jennifer Lawrence portrays Katniss Everdeen in a scene from ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 1."" The pairs troubled relationship becomes more of a focus than the Capitols imminent doomsday attacks. A visit to her annihilated hometown shows Katniss a barren wasteland of skeletal rubble but her bitterest tears are for the absent Peeta. Because you know its like a breakup. She mostly thinks the outside world needs to take care of itself. Director Francis Lawrence who did such a bang-up job on last years fierce ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" (and I hope will do equally well on next years finale) swings hits and misses. Katniss devoted best friend and hunting partner Gale (Liam Hemsworth) shows up from time to time to offer her a possible love alternate but his appearances are shallow and temporary much like Peetas propaganda TV ads. Say what you will about the ""Twilight"" movies the passion triangle of the girl the vampire guy and the werewolf guy was a solid section of the script. The ever-frightening Sutherland delivers President Snows every line like a mean face slap. As President Coin leader of the military rebels Julianne Moore is cool proficient reserved and personality-free performing what feels like a sly Hillary Clinton impression. The late Philip Seymour Hoffman playing the Capitols former Gamemaker and now its shrewdest enemy Plutarch Heavensbee handles every scene with bulls-eye precision his line reading playing tag with Moores constantly. A juicy bit part goes to Elizabeth Banks as Katniss former PR mentor the kind of good slightly evil Effie Trinket. Theres a sassy wisecrack in each comment she issues including her fashion-focused note that District 13s dull jumpsuits can be reconditioned appealingly just ""like democracy."" Jeffrey Wrights scientist returns in a role like James Bonds Q giving Katniss arrows explosive enough to shoot a bomber out of the sky. Though theres not enough action here to keep ""Mockingjay"" flying high Lawrence does get a standout moment doing just that. And shes entertaining in a silly scene when her character fails to deliver Heavensbee usable political footage amusingly playing her hero as a clumsy actress. Her most outstanding sequence is the oddest as she sings on camera a dark country ballad that becomes a theme for the revolutions suicide commandos. But Lawrence here lacks enough solid life-or-death material to work with. This is deliberately the bleakest segment of the series trying to flood us with emotion. I expect the finish to focus on excitement. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 Colin Covert has covered films for the Star Tribune for 20 years interviewing Peter Jackson Kate Winslet Steven Spielberg Cate Blanchett Quentin Tarantino Neil Gaiman and John Travolta to name a few.

"Jennifer Lawrence in The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 1 reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Jennifer Lawrence Continues to Make the Hunger Games Movies Seem Way Better Than They Are Jennifer Lawrence Continues to Make the Hunger Games Movies Seem Way Better Than They Are Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 20 2014 1128 AM Love Among the Ruins Teen romance and armed insurrection make strange bedfellows in Mockingjay Part I. By Dana Stevens Liam Hemsworth as Gale Hawthorne and Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen in Mockingjay Part 1. Murray Close/Lionsgate Entertainment The contradiction at the heart of the Hunger Games stories is on full display in Mockingjay Part I the third chapter of the movie tetralogy based on Suzanne Collins best-selling novels. The series chronicles a horribly destructive civil war taking place in a dystopic future in which a small class of hedonistic oligarchs subjugate torture and murder the citizenry at will. Yet the franchises essential appeal for many readers and viewers centers on a teenage love triangle inarguably an issue of slighter moral and dramatic weight (unless of course you are a teenager). Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Reconciling the puniness of Katniss Everdeens boyfriend dilemma with the scale of the political violence erupting around her was somehow less morally vexing in the first two chapters The Hunger Games and Catching Fire. Perhaps thats because Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and her preternaturally loyal sweethearts baker Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) and game-tracker Gale (Liam Hemsworth) were the chief action protagonists of those films responsible for using their skill and wit to survive. (Katniss and Peeta were trapped in a digital biodome and forced to--do we really need to go over the plot of The Hunger Games at this point?) In Mockingjay Part I directed by Francis Lawrence from a screenplay by Peter Craig and Danny Strong the symbolic wars of the Hunger Games--staged as cathartic spectacles for a depraved aristocracy--have given way to real war state terror and armed rebellion on a grand scale. Its harder to care about the question of whether shes just that into him (or him) when an entire hospital is full of wounded civilians are being firebombed. Its not Jennifer Lawrences fault that Katniss is an oxygen-hogging drama queen. Mockingjay Part Is maundering pace may also be attributable to the fact that its only the first half of a two-part finale. Collins last book has been divided into two films a choice increasingly common among studio heads dedicated to giving audiences additional time to say goodbye to beloved franchises (and themselves additional summer homes). It isnt spoiling the ending to say that this slow-moving penultimate chapter comes to a jarring halt right in the middle of a climactic scene. The suddenness of this ending seems meant to leave the audience in a state of jangling suspense but the vibe I sensed in the room after the cut to final credits was less ""Whoa Cant wait till next year"" than ""Well thats one place to randomly end things."" Advertisement But if Mockingjays placeholder status is a little too evident in its choppy shapeless structure this dark third chapter does have stretches of somber beauty. War and teenage angst make for uncomfortable narrative bedfellows but at least the political violence that rips through the fictional country of Panem is neither glossed over nor trivialized. (The film is rated PG-13 but there are scenes of point-blank execution and mass slaughter that may be too upsetting even for some older children.) And Jennifer Lawrence is actress enough to invest even Katniss comparatively low-stakes struggle with some dramatic heft. Its not Lawrences fault that the fierce Katniss is something of an oxygen-hogging drama queen one of those fantasy-wish-fulfillment heroines (like Twilights Bella another victim of franchise penultification) over whom the rest of the characters inexplicably fawn even when shes at her most annoying. As we begin Katniss who became a state-sanctioned national hero over the course of the first two films has just escaped from the forces of the nefarious President Snow (Donald Sutherland all but twisting a pinky at the corner of his lip). In an underground rebel hideout in District 13 the rebel organizer Alma Coin--Julianne Moore in ironed-straight silver hair this years look for coolly benevolent dystopian leaderesses--is assembling a homegrown militia to take on the seemingly unstoppable forces of the Capitol. Coin along with Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman)--the head gamemaker turned chief strategist for the resistance--knows that Katniss with her Panem-wide fame photogenic face and defiant nature will make the ideal symbol for their rebellion. In a series of propaganda videos they release after hacking into the state television channel Katniss becomes known (after the bird that came to stand for the secret rebellion in previous chapters) as ""the Mockingjay."" So the stage is set for a grand battle between the forces of repression and those of freedom--but youll need to wait a year for that battle to begin in earnest. With the exception of one spectacular attack on a Capitol dam (scored to an eerie faux-folk ballad sung by Lawrence and co-composed by Suzanne Collins herself) not much of military significance takes place in Mockingjay Part I. Instead the characters all spend a great deal of time talking in small rooms in the bunkerlike rebel outpost clad in matching olive-drab jumpsuits (to the horror of Effie Trinket the Capitol fashionista turned political refugee played with sweet campy pathos by Elizabeth Banks). Many of these conversations are about whether Katniss will agree to be the Mockingjay and on what terms--she wants to secure the release of Peeta whos being held prisoner at the Capitol and groomed as a reality-TV star. Mockingjay Part I might be charitably termed ""workmanlike"" but that adjective has an honor to it when applied to a performer like Philip Seymour Hoffman who turns the less-than-developed role of Heavensbee into a real character a wily operative with a grudging respect for his stubborn unmanageable charge. In a way Lawrences performance in this series serves as a tribute to her late co-star; shes becoming an actor who as Hoffman could elevates a run-of-the-mill blockbuster just by fully investing herself in the part. Its only her ability to telegraph Katniss genuine horror at the suffering she witnesses that allows us to put up with this sometimes grating characters incessant romantic waffling. ""I cant lose them both"" she sobs when both Gale and Peeta are in danger and even though you cant help feeling she kind of deserves to lose at least one of them you find yourself rooting for the whole angsty trio to come back for one more crack at saving the world.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet District 12 is gone reduced to a smoldering heap of rubble. District 13 long thought annihilated survives below the wreckage of its old structures. And Panem is once again in the grips of revolution sparked by the defiance of a loosed arrow and spreading swiftly across the remaining districts. This is the new world order Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) awoke to in the closing minutes of last years dystopian blockbuster Catching Fire. Taking place days perhaps only hours after the events of that superior sequel The Hunger Games Mockingjay--Part 1 finds the heroic archer stepping out of the frying pan of a televised death-match and into the fire of its aftermath. The Hunger Games are over but her troubles have just begun.Katniss as it turns out isnt the only one facing new obstacles The makers of this surefire smash have erected their own daunting hurdle and thats the difficulty in finding a way to cleave one self-contained tome--the final book in Suzanne Collins bestselling trilogy--into two satisfying installments. This is the future of big-budget filmmaking a Hollywood hustle to turn profitable source material into multi-movie investments. Its good for business but bad for drama and the inelegantly titled Mockingjay--Part 1 suffers from an unavoidable sense of anticlimax. It doesnt build to an ending so much as just eventually grind to a halt like a video game demanding more quarters to continue playing.To be fair the last movie didnt offer much in the way of resolution either; it went out on a blatant cliffhanger hooking audiences with a final rush of big reveals. But at least there was some oomph to that outro a sense of actual punctuation. The worst thing one could really say about Catching Fire is that it was working from a structure too similar to that of the original as though Collins had simply struck the reset button on her own work. Mockingjay by contrast actually deviates from the established pattern and one is relieved to discover how much better The Hunger Games is without the Hunger Games. The stealth highlight of this franchise has always been the flavorful cultural satire which takes center stage throughout much of Mockingjays fleet runtime.There is of course plenty of action. Back in the Gamemaker chair director Francis Lawrence stages a rescue mission thats equal parts Mission Impossible and Zero Dark Thirty while fitting in a spectacular shot of Katniss felling two bombers with an explosive arrow. But the war for Panem is chiefly a propaganda war with both sides taking to the airwaves to win the hearts and minds of a restless public. Much of the film takes place in an underground bunker where District 13 President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) and the duplicitous Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman blessedly not a CGI avatar) convince Katniss to be the face of their rebellion. (Shes like Elvis a superstar who enlists to galvanize the troops.) Theres a slyly meta hall-of-mirrors quality to some of this material Lawrence an actress who became famous because of this series is playing a young celebrity whose body everyone wants to control and exploit. (At one point on-the-wagon mentor Haymitch played again by a terrific Woody Harrelson argues that plastering her in makeup obliterates her authenticity and youth.) And when the rebel PR team creates a call-to-action ad featuring Katniss the logo is identical to the one thats been used to sell the Hunger Games movies. Like the franchise-flick equivalent of No the film argues that revolution can be peddled in the same manner as a Hollywood blockbuster.Likewise the best moments of Mockingjay dare to suggest that Katniss is just a pawn for the other side now her image manipulated anew. That point would sting more though if the Collins future-shock world allowed for more ethical gray area. But just as the Hunger Games of the last two movies tended to divide combatants down clean lines of good and evil the battle here between the empire and the rebels is ultimately as cut-and-dry as the one in Star Wars--especially given the lip-smacking villainy of Donald Sutherlands bad president whose tyranny is so great that any means to end his reign would be justified. Furthermore the film seems to complicate its least interesting relationship only to then back-peddle. How much more exciting would it be if Collins entertained a real motive for the dismaying behavior of love interest Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) rather than chasing away the moral ambiguity with an easy explanation? Mockingjay is solid proficient entertainment but it lacks a spark of real emotional conflict--the little something that might have made it feel worthwhile to pay full price for half a story.

But whether Ive cracked the political code of Suzanne Collins bestselling young-adult novels and the hugely successful movie franchise -- essentially I read Collins as a Burkean conservative not a radical of either the right or the left - is certain to be a matter of dispute. There are many reasons to describe ""The Hunger Games"" as a work of calculated genius but one reason is that its parable of Empire and Resistance feels relevant without being specific and appeals equally to anarchists and Tea Partyers. (For this chapter and the next one the screenplay is by Peter Craig and Danny Strong based on an adaptation written by Collins herself.)But lets set aside the heavy lifting for a sec and acknowledge that for most of ""Mockingjays"" target audience those questions dont much matter. This is a classic story of an adolescent pulling away from her elders and asserting her identity; if this particular adolescent is a combo of Joan of Arc and the goddess Artemis who is tough as nails can bring down a fighter plane with a bow and arrow and looks amazing in a skin-tight outfit so much the better. I was all prepared to tell you that ""Hunger Games"" star Jennifer Lawrence and director Francis Lawrence (no relation) had gone over the top into inflated melodrama this time out but it simply isnt true. ""Mockingjay - Part 1"" is a penultimate chapter without a real ending but its also a thrilling ride full of potent emotions new characters and major twists of fate built around another commanding star performance. Of all the big-budget popcorn movies of 2014 this one holds the screen with the least requirement for apology and speaks to the broadest possible audience.This is the first of the ""Hunger Games"" movies not to feature an extended central episode set inside the Hunger Games competition which Katniss Everdeen the hero-turned-rebel played by Jennifer Lawrence destroyed at the end of ""Catching Fire."" I suppose potential viewers for ""Mockingjay"" divide into two groups Those who want to know almost nothing about what happens and those who have it all memorized already. Lets keep it basic Katniss and a few other Games contestants including techno-nerd Beetee (Jeffrey Wright) and third-string young hunk Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) were rescued by a rebel military alliance housed in an underground compound in District 13 previously thought to have been destroyed long ago. So yeah its a little bit ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and a whole lot ""The Matrix Reloaded"" but without the cute robots or Billy Dee Williams or the rave scenes.These rebels have been fighting a virtuous struggle for years against the tyrannical rule of President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and the Louis XIV decadence of his Capitol. (Im sorry to do this but A capitol is a building Ms. Collins. A city can only be a capital.) They want Katniss to serve as their revolutionary symbol or Mockingjay in a series of verite-style propaganda videos and when she sees the scale of genocidal scorched-earth warfare Snow has been waging against the Districts she is happy to oblige. Francis Lawrence manages these ambiguous and troubling scenes with terrific skill There is nothing phony about Katniss anguish when confronted with Nazi-like atrocities or about her passionate hatred for the Capitol. But its also being packaged and manipulated toward uncertain ends. There is certainly a difference between Katniss ""propos"" and the anti-rebellion interviews her onetime boyfriend and teammate Peeta Mullark (Josh Hutcherson) is doing for Capitol TV with radioactive Hunger Games host Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci). But is the difference fundamental or only a matter of degree? You Might Also Like The embattled and isolated rebels have built their own cult of personality around icy rational President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore the splashiest addition to this cast) and emanate a general vibe of jumpsuited conformity that is not entirely reassuring. Katniss old pal and Hunger Games mentor Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) is here to play a cameo role in the revolution - but cold sober since Coins regime is strictly prohibitionist. Former game designer Plutarch Heavensbee now Coins right-hand man is still the same canny untrustworthy operator as ever - and yeah Plutarch is played by Philip Seymour Hoffman and I was surprised how painful it was to see him on-screen one more time. Its a terrifically slippery role to go out with at least. (Capitol fashion maven Effie Trinket marvelously played by Elizabeth Banks has been dragged into the revolutionary cause as well but she cant do anything about those jumpsuits.) So just to oversimplify a tad weve got the Roman Empire on one side and the Khmer Rouge on the other - with one badass teenage girl in the middle stuck between two boyfriends. Much of ""Mockingjay - Part 1"" especially its latter sections are concerned with assembling the pieces for the forthcoming final chapter Katniss pines for Peeta who is evidently being tortured in the Capitol and mostly ignores Gale (Liam Hemsworth) the macho hunter-warrior type whose only pathway out of the Friend Zone requires considerable pain and suffering. Coin and Snow are locked in a murky strategic game of attack and counterattack where its not clear who is leading and who following or even which of them is finally more despicable.I brought up Edmund Burke earlier because he drew an important philosophical line in the sand between the American Revolution which he supported and the subsequent French Revolution which he despised. No doubt thats inflating the coherence of the ""Hunger Games"" universe quite a bit since its more like a combination of Burkes aristocratic Whig caution and the humanist idealism of Jean-Jacques Rousseau a major Burke adversary. Well have to see how Francis Lawrence and his team handle Collins violent and explosive final chapter which delivers several different kinds of endings. (The second half of ""Mockingjay"" is still a full year away.) If this all adds up to a subtly self-sabotaging fable of rebellion that foregrounds the individual over the community as I strongly suspect thats hardly a surprise. As a work of potent ambivalent and open-ended pop spectacle its first-rate. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Now in Mockingjay the third film (with a final to come) Katniss has ascended to the face of the Districts violent insurrection and in turn director Francis Lawrence keeps his camera close to star Jennifer Lawrences sad eyes as she strides through the rubble Katniss has triggered. Many have died in her name yet Mockingjay only occasionally shows us the corpses charred wraiths whose exposed ribcages look like mouths screaming for liberty. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Katniss has never been a big-picture thinker. Shes fought only for her family and friends. Freedom is an afterthought. So director Lawrence is right to pan away from the dead to where the franchises real war has always raged Katniss conscience.The last film ended with the shock-and-awe twist of Katniss rescue from the Hunger Games arena by a rebel group from the supposedly extinct District 13 which the Capitol had purportedly bombed into oblivion two generations ago. Since then the survivors have lived underground plotting their revenge.Film Details The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 1 RatingPG-13 More Info ""War never stopped for us"" says Colonel Boggs (Mahershala Ali). In fact its all District 13 has ever known. In peace they built bombs. In war they stockpiled them. Culturally to the more agrarian Districts theyre as foreign as the Capitol.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm Inside a massive subterranean missile silo District 13ers live like sacrificial cogs in a dangerous machine. Their leader President Coin (Julianne Moore her red locks dyed granite gray) speaks in a monotone and wears the same plain jumpsuits as everyone else. ""You know what could use a revolution?"" sniffs Capitol glamour queen Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks). ""That hair.""President Coin doesnt have the personality to stir citizens to war. She cant even convince Katniss who has every reason to fight -- the Capitol has captured her on-again crush Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and is forcing him to go on TV to beg the rebels to make peace with President Snow. To rescue him Katniss must agree to be Coins Weapon of Mass Propaganda a role shes served inadvertently for two films and now must do knowing the brutal human cost.Mockingjay is where author Suzanne Collins books go from solid to superlative. Like J.K. Rowlings Harry Potter series the novels have a self-congratulatory intelligence Neither author can resist naming minor characters as if shes trying to earn extra credit for Latin 101. But Hunger Games is by far the smarter franchise. Collins doesnt just divide people into good evil and good disguised as evil. This is a story about ethical compromise where the heroine is willing to kill and it asks its audience to recognize that even Katniss allies are a little bit rotten -- and to accept that maybe thats half-OK.Since Mockingjay has been divided up into two segments this film is all about the buildup to war. Next years installment will have most of the action -- here the battle is waged on TV.If you break down the script into plot points it sounds a little silly The narrative thrust is simply Katniss shooting several pro-revolution commercials. But it works because were fascinated by media fights -- thousands occur online every day.Despite the dystopian setting a story beat where a lullaby that Katniss casually sings on camera ripples onward to become the chant of four dozen civilians marching toward their own massacre feels like both high-concept tragedy and the next evolution of AlexFromTarget. Turns out that when Collins wrote Mockingjay in 2010 she was predicting not only America in two centuries but also the accidental overnight Internet instafame that was just four years away.Yet the films fixation on narrow-minded Katniss means that we still arent given a chance on-screen to explore Collins elaborate world. Katniss keeps the film human -- here even when elevated to an icon she looks away embarrassed as the District 13 crowd applauds her latest ad.Jennifer Lawrence can say more with a chagrined side-eye than most actresses could with a page-long speech. Still sometimes the attention the film itself lavishes on her feels absurd. Director Lawrence cant even let fellow Hunger Games arena survivor Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) confess that a pimping President Snow forced the winners into prostitution -- a revelation that should make people rally around this survivor too -- without splicing in Katniss ignoring him to watch a special-ops mission on a monitor.""Miss Everdeen this revolution is about everyone"" President Coin snipes.

Mockingjay the final installment in Suzanne Collins best-selling YA trilogy wasnt conceived in two parts. That was a decision made in Hollywood by a studio looking to double down and milk every last dime out of its blockbuster franchise. The suits probably thought ""Hey it worked for Harry Potter and Twilight so why not us?"" You cant blame them for wanting to keep the good times rolling. But its a pretty cynical business plan and its led to a film that feels needlessly padded. Mockingjay--Part 1 is like a term paper with the margins enlarged and the font size jacked up to reach the assigned number of pages. This is especially disappointing because the previous chapter 2013s Catching Fire was such a pleasant surprise. While the 2012 original laid out Collins dystopian death-sport milieu with flair and faithfulness it was also a bit flat. Catching Fire on the other hand gave the heroine Katniss Everdeen an adrenalized urgency. As played by Jennifer Lawrence Katniss developed into a character who was both brainy and badass. Now in Mockingjay--Part 1 shes become passive. The movie picks up after the incendiary conclusion of Catching Fires Quarter Quell when Katniss was rescued and brought to the rebels underground fortress in District 13. Here the anti-Capitol leaders plot their next strike against President Snow (Donald Sutherland) hatching a plan to turn Katniss into the fiery symbol of the resistance and spur the powerless citizens of Panem to rise up against the Capitol. Its a propaganda war and shes the secret weapon--a Che Guevara T-shirt made flesh. The rebel brain trust includes President Coin (Julianne Moore sporting silver Cruella De Vil locks) spin-savvy strategist Plutarch (Philip Seymour Hoffman to whom the film is dedicated) hacker Beetee (Jeffrey Wright) the newly clean and sober Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) and Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks channeling a drag queen). They send Katniss and Gale (Liam Hemsworth) to the front lines with a guerrilla film crew that records her battlefield heroics and beams it all back to the huddled masses. But Snow has a secret weapon of his own. Kidnapped by the nefarious presidents forces at the end of the last movie Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) reappears in the Capitol and in a series of interviews with the sensationalist journalist Caesar (Stanley Tucci) he denounces Katniss and urges a cease-fire. The betrayal devastates her forcing her to realize that her feelings for him werent a charade after all. With its Wag the Dog subplot and fist-in-the-air proletarianism Mockingjay may be the most harmlessly Marxist movie to come out of Hollywood since Reds. I suppose director Francis Lawrence and writers Peter Craig and Danny Strong deserve some credit for daring to sneak any political cheekiness into a movie thats as big and corporate as this. But overall their hands are tied too tightly. While the series first two films captured the grandeur of the outdoors during the kill-or-be-killed competitions Mockingjay is mostly bound to the bleak and claustrophobic bowels of a bunker. It suffocates the film. And when the story finally does manage to get interesting toward the end it just screeches to a halt and cuts off leaving fans wriggling on the hook for a finale they wont get to see for another 12 months.

(Murray Close/Associated Press via Lionsgate) By Ann Hornaday November 19 2014 Follow AnnHornaday By definition ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 1"" is only half a movie. As the first part of the last installment of the juggernaut adaptation of the wildly popular young-adult novel this dutiful glumly atmospheric placeholder feels like a long extended inhale a collective ""Here we go"" before the last triumphant hurrah. As the movie opens the series heroine Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is being held at a rebel outpost in District 13 where precinct president Alma Coin -- played by Julianne Moore with silver-haired seriousness -- is seeking to galvanize the remaining districts to overtake the capital city and rid the nation Panem of its fascistic leader President Snow (Donald Sutherland). Katniss having just destroyed the sadistic Hunger Games by way of her steady aim with a bow and arrow is the obvious choice to rally the rebels. As Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) keeps insisting to Coin Katniss has just the ""anger-driven defiance"" to be the perfect face of the burgeoning revolution. The choice of words is meaningful Although there are some explosive battles and grisly scenes of their aftermath in ""Mockingjay"" the war is primarily fought by way of televised pronouncements and carefully choreographed electronic propaganda. When an early attempt at an inspirational video featuring Katniss falls flat she winds up doing an extended video opp -- much like an electronic press kit for a movie like ""Mockingjay"" -- by visiting a field hospital receiving a welcome one might expect for Eleanor Roosevelt or Joan of Arc. ""The Hunger Games"" continues to set the world on fire with ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay--Part 1."" Directed by Francis Lawrence Everdeen fights to save Peeta Mellark in this film based on a novel that is the third in a trilogy written by Suzanne Collins. (Lionsgate) As a charismatic figure Katniss is a singularly reticent and unsmiling one Shes uncertain whether the allies she made during the Hunger Games have all died and shes in particular mourning for Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) from whom she became separated during the last chapter. Even her best friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth) cant seem to shake her out of her lugubrious mood. One of the only seemingly spontaneous moments in ""Mockingjay"" occurs when Katniss travels to her ravaged home in District 12 to retrieve her beloved sisters pet cat. ""Youre breakin my heart"" she mutters when she stuffs the squalling creature into her bag. Its just the kind of irreverent line that one would expect from Lawrence the bold often recklessly unpredictable young actress who has become fused with the literary heroine of a generation. As ever Lawrence is not only the best thing about ""Mockingjay"" but also probably the one thing that makes an otherwise dreary derivatively dystopian franchise worth watching. Even trudging through the post-industrial carnage and underground bunkers of the films blighted universe she radiates unaffected humanity and light. Thats all the more remarkable considering how much time shes forced to spend crying scowling and looking steely-eyed into cameras -- which as in Lawrences real life are omnipresent. Like the actress herself Katniss isnt one for cutesy canned promo shots. But she knows the value of projecting the right persona. Even though her stylist Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) is no more Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) is on hand a bit more drab for the wear but armed with cool designs for Katnisss next incarnation as the messianic icon of a new world order. ""We will make you the best dressed rebel in history"" Effie coos. ""Everyones going to want to kiss you kill you or be you."" Such is the stuff that all girls dreams are made of. Perhaps the cleverest feat of the ""Hunger Games"" epic has been to marry so seamlessly the shallow values of our own image-driven culture the virtues of fashion at its most self- expressive classic anti-authoritarian political ideals and the irresistible ungovernable force that is female adolescence. Lawrences Katniss is the perfect foil for all four her raw-boned beauty strength and steady focus just as compelling at their most unadorned as when theyre tricked out for maximum stage presence. Directed by Francis Lawrence from a script by Peter Craig and Danny Strong ""Mockingjay"" gains steam as it goes. Its retro-futuristic aesthetic lacks the flamboyance of past installments but possesses its own grim integrity and even contains one authentically shocking reversal that bears more than a whiff of a ""Manchurian Candidate""-like menace. Its a joyless surpassingly dour enterprise but one that fulfills its mission with Katnisss own eagle-eyed efficiency and unsentimental somberness. ""Mockingjay"" sets up the end Game with a grim sense of purpose.   1/2 PG-13. At area theaters.

Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 937 a.m. MST November 20 2014Jennifer Lawrence is again outstanding in a film that exists largely to set up the final installment in ""The Hunger Games"" series.Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Gale (Liam Hemsworth) take on the Capitol and President Snow (Donald Sutherland) in ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 1.""(Photo Lionsgate)Story HighlightsCritics review 3.5 starsJennifer Lawrence is again the best thing about the movie.Talented actors like Lawrence Philip Seymour Hoffman Donald Sutherland make the film compelling.It all sets up a showdown between Katniss and Snow which means Lawrence and Sutherland.One of these days a studio is going to leave well enough alone and not needlessly expand young-adult novels into extra movie sequels to make a few more bucks.OK a lot more bucks.But today is not that day as this title tells you ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 1."" Its a mouthful. Its also a pretty good movie that probably could have been a better one.More azcentral.coms newest movie reviewsSuzanne Collins wrote three ""Hunger Games"" novels. But in the manner of ""Harry Potter"" and ""Twilight"" we get four film installments. Sure its a license to print money but it dilutes the product. So while ""Mockingjay"" does an effective job getting us primed for a rebellion against the evil Capitol it necessarily leaves us hanging at the end waiting for the real battle to begin.But as they say in the Book of Sports Cliches it is what it is. The film picks up where the last one left off with Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) rescued from the Hunger Games by Plutarch (the late great Philip Seymour Hoffman). Shes living in District 13 which everyone thought was long gone but is actually a hivelike underground bunker that houses people who support the rebellion against the Capitol and its cold-hearted President Snow (Donald Sutherland).Katniss family is with her (she even smuggles in her sisters cat) and so is old friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth). But shes almost despondent over Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) being left behind.Related 5 essential films Jennifer LawrenceKatniss is by now a full-on hero the inspiration for rebellion in the districts; Plutarch and President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) want to turn her into the face of the uprising as well. Plutarch imagines a public-relations campaign with propaganda videos but a studio-shot green-screen version is awful (though its fun to watch the immensely talented Lawrence be a bad actor).So they hit the real battlefields with Cressida (Natalie Dormer) a director and her film crew in tow. This gives Lawrence a chance to display Katniss heroism and righteous anger but also her frustration and pain. A tragedy results in great footage that has the desired effect in the other districts.Interview Qamp;A with Natalie DormerBut Snow has his own PR machine with a secret weapon Peeta who shows up in videos looking slightly dazed and telling the rebels to stand down. Hes interviewed by the unctuous host Caesar Flickerman again played by Stanley Tucci who perfectly captures the vapidity of the TV interview. This too has the desired effect It shatters Katniss which Snow knew would happen.Donald Sutherlands performance as President Snow elevates ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 1."" (Photo Lionsgate)Its all building toward a showdown. Which you can catch next year.Director Francis Lawrence does a nice job capturing the claustrophobic environment of District 13 and has a good eye for action shots. But the actors are what really sell the movie. Their investment in sometimes-ludicrous dialogue and situations make the films stakes seem more real and more compelling. Hoffman to whom the film is dedicated is so good it takes you a minute to realize some of what hes saying is just silly.Related 5 essential films Woody HarrelsonMoore has the biggest challenge with some inspire-the-troops speeches that border on pabulum but shes a terrific actress. Sutherland excels at playing the crafty Snow who appreciates Katniss talents even as he works gleefully to destroy her and everyone around her.Of course it all comes down to Lawrence in the end. Without her the movies would be unwatchable. The difference in her performance here and in something like ""American Hustle"" is remarkable but not surprising. Shes great.I didnt read the books but its clear (certainly in the movies) that beneath everything else ""The Hunger Games"" comes down to a war of wills between Katniss and Snow which means a showdown between Lawrence and Sutherland.I cant wait for that. Which I guess is the point of ""Part 1"" alas.AZCENTRALThe Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 1 (2014) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsThe Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 13.5 starsDirector Francis Lawrence.Cast Jennifer Lawrence Josh Hutcherson Liam Hemsworth.Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action some disturbing images and thematic material.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

After 2013s thrilling and entertaining ""Hunger Games Catching Fire"" this third in a four-film cycle adapted from Suzanne Collins phenomenally popular trilogy moves glacially in spots and is a letdown for fans who got caught up in the surprises of the creative action scenes of the first two films. Its also notably more cynical and has a lot more talk. While it does deepen the development of secondary characters and makes us despise its villainous government more than ever it also poses the ultimate question Did Collins final book need to be cleaved into two distinct films? Given how stretched out it seems for its two-hour running time I suspect not.In ""Mockingjay"" the emphasis shifts from the children-slaying-children games to focus on political oppression and the psychological tyranny wrought by a violent futuristic government. If you dont already have an inkling of what Panem is or what a district means expect to get entirely lost in a dystopian haze. If youve not seen the first two movies best to plan a bingewatch beforehand -- or read the books. Advertisement As in the book ""Mockingjay -- Part 1"" is a nightmare-inducing storyline that shakes us awake to the evil that governments can do (read into it what you will). Feisty archer Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) a two-time Games winner finds herself getting packaged and propagandized into a Panem rebel idol. The goal? To muster more rousing defiance from the downtrodden districts. Her nemesis remains the dont-let-them-see-you-bleed President Snow (a deliciously evil Donald Sutherland) who uses white roses and her accidental boyfriend Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) in an attempt to kill Katniss spirit. The film opens with Katniss literally going underground to seek refuge with District 13 survivors who exist in a drab sunless environment in which even a fashionista train wreck like Effie (Elizabeth Banks sparkling per the norm) must dress down. The only one who looks good remains Gale (Liam Hemsworth) whose character is better defined here; hes still crushing on Katniss his best friend from childhood and takes a more commanding role as a soldier in the growing rebellion.A new character is introduced -- District 13s President Coin (Julianne Moore) -- who consults heavily with Plutarch Heavensbee (the late and great Philip Seymour Hoffman) to strategize how Katniss can become the lighting rod that jolts a government overthrow. These scenes are well done and give the film a dark and sly humor. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) in The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 1 (Murray Close/Lionsgate) ( Murray Close ) Katniss isnt onboard entirely with the plan and is still suffering from the effects of feeling responsible for the governments violence on its people. When she sees Peeta looking like an instrument of the government as hes interviewed on TV by Caesar (Stanley Tucci) her concern grows. To help her get her fire back a sober Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) arrives to dispense advice. Harrelson brightens the movie too.Despite its change of pace fans of Collins best-selling trilogy will likely understand that ""Mockingjay -- Part 1"" simply sets the table for the epic finale scheduled for release in November 2015. And lets be honest -- a big part of the franchises success is Lawrences portrayal of the tough but vulnerable Katniss and she gives another fearless performance here. Other plusses include the addition of the Moore who adds gravitas and a sharper focus on secondary characters. The political parallels that Collins and screenwriters Peter Craig and Danny Strong have drawn also give the series a strong sense of urgency. But in the final leg the film makes one doozy of a false move telegraphing what should have been one shocking smashing game-changer of a development. While it doesnt ruin the film this reveal along with the pacing clips the wings of ""Mockingjay -- Part 1"" thereby making it the least satisfying ""Hunger Games"" entry yet.

Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is a full-on rebel leader in The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 1.(Photo Murray Close Lionsgate via AP)In The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 1 Katniss Everdeen comes off like a cross between Che Guevara and Joan of Arc as she blossoms into a full-fledged leader of a revolution.Shes still an ace archer but her status as a compassionate warrior catapults her from being the symbol of the rebellion to spearheading the fight against the totalitarian regime that controls their universe -- once North America now known as Panem.This third Hunger installment (1/2 out out of four; rated PG-13; opens Thursday in select cities and Friday nationwide) is a nimbly constructed action-adventure blockbuster with a social conscience. It deepens the characters and further invests the audience in the saga of Katniss and her competing love interests Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) and Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth).As an adaptation of part of the third book by Suzanne Collins its easily the most political of the three films. It also is the most absorbing and best in the series. Last years Catching Fire felt like more of the same from 2012s original Hunger Games presenting more contests to the death among young ""tributes"" for the amusement of the powers that be. But this sequel burrows deeper into the concept of revolution.USA TODAYMockingjay lands in Los AngelesThe world is controlled by President Snow(Donald Sutherland) who issues orders for public executions mass slaughters and air strikes on rebel districts while ensconced in his elegant mansion in the ultra-decadent Capitol.Jennifer Lawrence reveals greater depth and emotional layers as rebel leader Katniss. and is bolstered by powerhouse supporting performances. New to the dystopian franchise Julianne Moore plays District 13 President Alma Coin with just the right blend of stern authority and humanity. Her right-hand man is the once-sinister now-wearied Plutarch Heavensbee played perfectly by Philip Seymour Hoffman.Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) is embroiled in the revolution in The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 1. (Photo Murray Close Lionsgate via AP)While the first film showed the power of propaganda as cleverly put forth by Snow Mockingjay explores it more fully. The universe is in a state of oppression and wretched despair. Civil unrest had grown in the last saga and reaches new heights here.A ragtag filmmaking crew led by Cressida (Natalie Dormer) follows Katniss and simply records her mushrooming anger as she surveys the devastation in her own district and others. A scene in which she visits a makeshift hospital for those severely wounded by the airstrikes in the Capitol is a key moment. This is not post-apocalyptic fantasy. It feels much more like a war movie than the previous films and has a timeliness lacking in the others.USA TODAYThe real reason why Jessica Simpson hit the Mockingjay premiereLawrence has always been perfect in the part. With anyone else in the lead role the franchise might have faltered. But she brings an authenticity thats striking. Shes the classic reluctant hero.More thoughtful and less action-packed Mockingjay also is subtly funny. Elizabeth Banks as fashionista Effie Trinket provides some of the funnier one-liners as does Woody Harrelsons Haymitch Abernathy who shows up late in the game.A well-crafted emotional cliffhanger concludes this third part of the four-part series upping the suspense and whetting the appetite for next years Part 2.Corrections amp; Clarifications An earlier version of this review cited the wrong district for District 13 President Alma Coin. 1756 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 13 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1uRnaJi",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/11/19/hunger-games-mockingjay-review/18102107/,200,thehungergamesmockingjay-part129,thehungergamesmockingjay-part1,usatoday

(AP Photo/Lionsgate Murray Close) Share PhotoLOS ANGELES (AP) -- All is not well in Panem. At the conclusion of ""The Hunger Games Catching Fire"" Katnisss (Jennifer Lawrence) force-field shattering arrow left the society in turmoil. The desperate act was perceived as subversion inciting populist uprisings and devastating counter attacks by the governing elite.Thus revolution is on the horizon in the franchises third installment ""Mockingjay - Part 1"" and it all hinges on Katniss the unwitting face and spirit of the movement. You see Katniss much like the movie star actress who plays her is just generally liked. Everything she does is slapped with meaning and significance regardless of her intentions. She has become the property of the people.This has always been clear to Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who aims to use her as a propaganda machine. But theres a problem the girl on fire has flamed out.In the chaos that followed the conclusion of the second film Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) was captured by the Capitol District 12 was destroyed (though Katniss mother sister and the steely jawed Gale (Liam Hemsworth) escaped alive) and Katniss was taken by the militaristic District 13. Their President Alma Coin (franchise newcomer Julianne Moore) needs her to be their poster girl.""Mockingjay - Part 1"" is ultimately a slow-burn portrait of the repeated rise and fall of dystopias most reluctant hero nimbly told through its examination of the mechanics of propaganda. With the help of Plutarch Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) and the toned-down (but still delightful) Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) Katniss attempts to serve the cause in her own way.But its not just a matter of convincing her to forget or at least shelve her past traumas. Katnisss confidence and devotion to the revolt is put to the test when she sees how the evil President Snow (Donald Sutherland) is manipulating Peeta and using him for his own propaganda needs.In the Games the goal was simple Keep Peeta alive. Now Katniss is powerless just a tool of the machine. Charred and fatally wounded bodies aside ""Mockingjay - Part 1"" is not for the faint of heart when it comes to the relentless emotional torture of its heroine.Director Francis Lawrence in his second outing in the franchise stays fairly true to the original text carrying over the war-torn bleakness of ""Catching Fire"" without any of the disturbing thrill of the Games. He sprinkles in a handful of fairly exciting action sequences (one of which was not actually described in the book) but he mostly allows the film to luxuriate in the quiet moments. Yet too many involve Katniss tearing up while sitting on piles of rubble.In its best moments the movie has a tense night before the battle feel. Only the battle is still a year away.Ever since the ""Harry Potter"" juggernaut split their final story into two separate films its become standard practice in Hollywood for every successful franchise regardless of whether or not the story is there. ""Mockingjay - Part 1"" is a serviceable entry into the conclusion of Katnisss saga. It boasts some imaginative visuals a few truly thrilling moments and standout performances from Lawrence Banks Harrelson and Hoffman to whom the film is dedicated.Still even with Hoffmans subtly brilliant reaction shots it does not seem to be the type of movie that fans will revisit on its own. This half is part of a whole in the most cynical way.You say you want a revolution? Theyll get to that next year.""The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 1"" a Lionsgate release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""intense sequences of violence and action some disturbing images and thematic material."" Running time 123 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.___MPAA definition of PG-13 Parents strongly cautioned.

You know because in an effort to make two movies from one very popular book theyve padded out this installment -- and in the laziest possible ways. Following Katniss Everdeens disruption of the Hunger Games in Catching Fire the militarized District 13 is attempting to rally the other Districts to rise up against the Capital. Wouldnt it have been fun to spend some time among the undecided watching them process the competing messages about liberty and security? Instead Here we are flying. Here we are sitting. Here we are walking. Here we are marching down stairs... Speaking of lazy for a film about the power of media to sway humanity in a desired direction its awfully leaden. (How on earth did Julianne Moores concrete slab of a character ever get elected President of a rebellion? No wonder they need the Mockingjays mug to serve as their Che T-shirt.) Director Francis Lawrence seems content to let star Jennifer Lawrence show you how you should feel during any given scene as opposed to presenting things with any kind of inherent drama. Shes a capable actress but at times the load is just too heavy and she can only break down into histrionics. What the film gets right is its portrayal of a Young Person full of Young Person concerns dealing with Old People and their Old People preoccupations. (Basically ""I want to rescue my friend"" vs. ""We want to win a war."") Also the vampiric nature of moviemaking (Natalie Dormer is great as a director chasing the shot above all else.) 2014. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

"The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 1 | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 1 An exciting slow-burn build-up to what is sure to be a stormy finale. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com11/19/2014 Editor rating 3 The most important thing to know about The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 1 is that youre only going to get two thirds of a movie. Mirroring the increasing trend in popular film franchises (Harry Potter Twilight) and TV shows (Breaking Bad Mad Men) distributor Lionsgate has split Suzanne Collins final novel in her bestselling trilogy into two films. That decision feels like a pure cash-grab this time around -- the book was no longer than the others which were comfortably squeezed into standalone single movies -- and you walk out of the theater vaguely unsatisfied at the lack of a third act a release of all the tension and suspense director Francis Lawrence expertly crafts. Imagine an Olympic track and field race in which the announcer shouts ""Runners on your marks ... get set ... come back next year"" Thats how you feel when the end credits pop up. Instead of going full-hog and sending out the series with a full-on three-hour epic the filmmakers have opted to squeeze every last drop from this money-minting rock. That said Mockingjay -- Part 1 still makes for dark grim and exciting entertainment. Picking up where Catching Fire left off Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) have been separated Shes been rescued by the rebels led by President Coin (Julianne Moore rocking long white hair) and her assistant Plutarch (the late Philip Seymour Hoffman) who hope to use Katniss popularity to fuel the oppressed population to rise up against their oppressors. Peeta meanwhile has been captured by the tyrannical President Snow (Donald Sutherland) who has brainwashed the young man into appearing on TV to convince people to obey their leaders and lay down their arms. Peeta becomes a propaganda tool a countermove to every small victory by the uprising to capture the hearts and minds of the public. Like the novel did Mockingjay - Part 1 eschews big action setpieces and the colorful spectacle of the previous two films for a graver tone that explores the effect of the media on the average person and how easily political messages can be manipulated to garner the intended results. Both sides are guilty of this Initially the rebels try to film a reluctant Katniss on a soundstage trying to fuel a revolution via scripted lines but she comes off fake and unconvincing. The only way to get Katniss to spark fire in the populace is to send her out on the battlefield and let her see the destruction the Capitol has wreaked on her former hometown as punishment for her behavior. Adapted by Peter Craig and Danny Strong Mockingjay - Part 1 could have easily become a talky and dull polemic designed to give the coming war some heft. But the actors draw you in making you forget almost half of the film takes place in a dank gray underground shelter. Moore Hoffman and Jeffrey Wright help lend gravity to what could have come off as silly and trite and Liam Hemsworth as Gale Katniss boyfriend is finally given more to do than form one leg of a romantic triangle. Returning players Woody Harrelson and Elizabeth Banks as Katniss trainer and assistant are no longer garish cartoons Over the course of three films they have become vital characters and youre happy to see them back. Lawrence continues to plumb depths of despair and anguish in Katniss without becoming tiresome; her transformation from a reluctant I-dont-want-to-do-this recruit into a willing political symbol is convincing and rousing. Director Lawrence once again proving how bad of a fit filmmaker Gary Ross was with the first cheesy film gives you a couple of suspenseful action setpieces but this is more of a prelude to the storm than anything else (its telling that Katniss only fires one arrow in the entire film although the shot brings down the house causing the audience at a recent screeening to explode into applause). Theres no point in whining about what could have been if Mockingjay hadnt been cleaved in two Whats done is done. But its a testament to how good Mockingjay - Part 1 is that the temptation for those of us who havent read the books to search Wikipedia to find out what happens next has never been greater. Unlike The Hobbit trilogy the film doesnt feel padded or drawn out (it has the shortest running time of any installment in the series clocking in at less than two hours without end credits). The down time spent with the characters in this movie will no doubt pay off in the final installment making the stakes count in a way they hadnt before. What began as a clever but superficial piece of dystopian sci-fi has developed into an engrossing and grave saga that no longer feels like it was written primarily for teenagers. Even the love triangle between Katniss Gale and Peeta which previously felt tacked on and unnecessary has taken on considerable importance. The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 1 isnt perfect but I suspect the film will play a lot better once we get the second half of the story and the seeds that have been planted begin to sprout. You say you want a revolution? Be careful what you wish for.

In theaters Nov. 21. advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In which Katniss Everdeen joins the revolution against Panem. Rated PG-13 (some strong violence). BOTTOM LINE Lawrences Katniss is mostly out of the action and playing dress-up for the revolution in this low-action entry in the popular teen franchise. CAST Jennifer Lawrence Liam Hemsworth Philip Seymour Hoffman Julianne Moore. WHEN/WHERE Area theaters with many midnight screenings Thursday. LENGTH 203 Slings and arrows are replaced by propaganda videos in ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 1"" the first of a two-part finale in a young-adult franchise that once seemed smarter and edgier than most. In this chapter Katniss Everdeen the working-class rebel played by Jennifer Lawrence mostly holsters her weapons and plays dress-up just as the movie itself gives up any higher aspirations of offering social commentary or insight. Its a disappointing third entry in a series that initially promised us so much. Lawrences Katniss a strong-willed survivor armed with a bow and arrow looked like a new feminist icon; Panem a downtrodden dystopia ruled by the elitist President Snow (Donald Sutherland still deliciously evil) struck a contemporary nerve; the Hunger Games themselves in which children killed each other for televised sport tested the limits of the PG-13 rating. A bit of swoony nonsense in which beau-hunks Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) and Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth) vie for Katniss affections seemed like a small price to pay. advertisement | advertise on newsday Here Lawrences Katniss has become The Mockingjay -- essentially the poster girl for a revolution led by President Coin (Julianne Moore) and her public relations guru Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman in one of his final roles). The only games here are between warring propaganda machines Katniss trailed by a reality-television crew shouts fiery slogans atop piles of rubble while the seemingly traitorous Peeta toes the party line on state-run television (Stanley Tucci returns as the toadying talk-show host Caesar Flickerman). The result is a series of long actionless stretches that director Francis Lawrence (of the previous film) cant seem to liven up. Whats more the movies main setting -- an underground city populated by soldier-civilians -- looks drab. Costume designer Trish Summerville who dressed Panems high society with kooky flair has been replaced by the duo known as Kurt amp; Bart who create some spiffy armor for Katniss along with several thousand identical jumpsuits. If ""Mockingjay Part 1"" feels Orwellian its because nobody in it ever wonders about the deeper truths behind the propaganda. Elizabeth Banks returning as Effie Trinket tells Katniss ""We will make you the best-dressed rebel in history"" which seems to be the main fantasy this franchise is selling.

The third ""Hunger Games"" movie starring Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson among many other big name actors does well as a pop culture phenomenon movie. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Haute couture is out and grey jumpsuits are in as the popular ""Hunger Games"" chronicles continue In honor of the title well break this part of the sentence with a colon and then use a portentous dash""The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 1"" is a worthy third movie in the Suzanne Collins franchise -- destined to satisfy the legions of filmgoers willing to swing with a lot of scheming and skulking in an underground bunker resembling the worlds most frightening Marriott in order to get to the revolution. The third book in Collins dystopian-literature juggernaut has been halved. As such following the lucrative blueprint of the ""Harry Potter"" and the ""Twilight"" film series this pentultimate ""Hunger Games"" chapter has what all such films have namely a few stretch marks and an ending that goes beyond ""cliffhanger.""And it works. The film works. The scale of these ""Hunger Games"" dys-lit film adaptations is large but not misjudged and theres always a new post-apocalyptic district to explore in detail. From the first they got the casting so very right with this ongoing project from Jennifer Lawrence (a crier but also a fighter and a fiercely talented performer) on down. In the second ""Hunger Games"" movie directed (as is this new one) with a gravely absorbing air by Francis Lawrence the fashion-runway frou-frou and hooraw dominated the action to the point of smothering it. All thats gone. Katniss Everdeen whose defiance of the dictatorial President Snow has ignited the masses across all the impoverished districts has become the symbol of the rebellion. ""Mockingjay"" charts her entry into war her initially reluctant usefulness as an propaganda tool and her glower of destiny egged on by close-ups of Donald Sutherland and those evilly arched eyebrows. Hunger Games Murray Close / Lionsgate Jennifer Lawrence stars in the movie ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 1."" Jennifer Lawrence stars in the movie ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 1."" (Murray Close / Lionsgate) ""We have a bigger issue than wardrobe"" says Philip Seymour Hoffmans Plutarch onetime gamemaker working for the state now a fellow revolutionary and a kind of image consultant for Katniss. That line delivered by the late Hoffman (he died during filming of the final ""Mockingjay"" film) sounds suspiciously like a dig at the flamboyance of the second picture. Now in the bowels of District 13 all is olive-green and gun-metal grey. Julianne Moore new to the series is ramping up the revolution as President Coin the good president. The underground lair doesnt do much for the former Hunger Games fashion maven Effie again played by Elizabeth Banks. She returns to a role that wasnt originally in the ""Mockingjay"" novel and its fun to see her at odds with her newfound inelegant surroundings. ""Im condemned to this life of jumpsuits"" she cracks at one point.In addition to the casting another more elusive component put the ""Hunger Games"" series on solid ground from the start. Even though ""Mockingjay"" contains scenes of mass graves and mass slaughter on the battlefield this isnt a movie or a set of characters built on bloodlust or the enjoyment of anonymous kills. Katniss remains a marvelous shot with a bow and arrow but shes just a young woman trying to keep whats left of her family together and rescue the baker boy Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) from the clutches of Snow. Much of the film is pitched at a conversational hush so its doubly striking when Katniss and Peeta reunite and the results ... well spoiler so ... Ill shut up. Hunger Games Murray Close / Lionsgate Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and President Coin (Julianne Moore) in ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 1."" Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and President Coin (Julianne Moore) in ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 1."" (Murray Close / Lionsgate) Not everything in ""Mockingjay"" is dynamic or remarkable. Director Lawrence working from Peter Craig and Danny Strongs screenplay occasionally mistakes somnambulance for solemnity. But having come through the ""Twilight"" movies more or less in one piece (not all of them stank for the record) its easy to appreciate how Collins world (a bit thin on the page but irresistible to millions) has been realized on screen. In ""Mockingjay"" Plutarch turns our heroine into a movie-style action heroine for the purposes of his revolution marketing campaign and its as if the movie is making fun of its own image in the popular culture. First Katniss was a feral woodland creature; then in the second movie she swanned into legend as a flaming fashion star. Now shes a warrior both for fake and for real and that double-headed assignment gives Lawrence and company a lot to activate. The series wraps up with the release of ""Mockingjay 2"" in November 2015. As the old Ira Gershwin lyric put it Comes the revolution all is jake / Comes the revolution well be eating cake.

Photo AP MOVIE REVIEW The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 1 Running time 123 minutes. Rated PG-13 (intense action violence). Thursday night at the Empire the Union Square others. How do you waste one of the most exciting young actresses of our time -- not to mention the time and money of millions of moviegoers? ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 1"" accomplishes this by turning Jennifer Lawrences groundbreaking woman warrior Katniss Everdeen into pretty much a spectator in this insufferably dull penultimate installment which thinly spreads a half-hours worth of plot over two plodding hours. Like the next-to-last episodes of the Harry Potter and Twilight franchises this snoozy slog arbitrarily cuts the third book in Suzanne Collins trilogy in half for no good reason other than cleaning up at the box office one more time. Not that that will stop diehard fans though those who get dragged along should be prepared for a good nap. The late Philip Seymour Hoffman and Julianne Moore star as Plutarch Heavensbee and President Alma Coin in ""Mockingjay -- Part 1.""Photo Lionsgate You probably know from the trailer that Katniss who has given up the Hunger Games to become a full-time revolutionary shoots down a bomber with an explosive arrow. Unfortunately thats about all Lawrence gets to do in the action department. Mostly she mopes makes speeches cries sings songs and tapes public service announcements on half of the revolution led by District 13 president Alma Coin (Julianne Moore slumming with what looks like Meryl Streeps leftover gray wig from ""The Giver""). Lawrence spends an unconscionable amount of time sitting in what resembles a huge parking garage listening to well-paid returnees Philip Seymour Hoffman Woody Harrelson and Jeffrey Wright delivering boring exposition. And watching her former fellow tribute and love Peeta Mallark (Josh Hutcherson) -- whos been brainwashed at the behest of Panem President Snow (Donald Sutherland) -- being interviewed on TV by smarmy Stanley Tucci. Donald Sutherland as the sinister President Snow in ""Mockingjay -- Part 1""Photo Lionsgate Aside from Tucci and Elizabeth Banks as Katniss stylist the camp and glam factor of the first two films has been dialed down to near-zero and theres the barest hint of political satire this time around. Instead what we have is a rather grim and humorless version of the lesser action films derived from young adult novels that have flooded the marketplace. And theres a positive famine of action in this ""Hunger Games"" -- the big set piece an attack on a dam is over almost before it begins. In the hands of returning director Francis Lawrence an invasion of the Capitol is a non-starter. Drab and dimly lit visuals dont disguise the fact that the special effects are very much less than state-of-the-art. ""Mockingjay"" meanders its way as a lame romantic cliffhanger but hopefully Jennifer Lawrence will actually be given something worthwhile to do next time around. That would actually be worth paying to see.

But which ones? If what you liked about the series was Katniss complicated love life -- the eternally broken heart of YA fiction -- well thats here. And if what you enjoyed were the colorful supporting characters theyre mostly here too (even if some of them like Effie Trinket have little to do). But if what you truly loved about the series was its fierce heroine -- our young Diana of the arena with her bow and her arrow and her unabashed willingness to lead even while carefully balancing the merits of sacrifice and survival -- then you may be let down. And in a series thats supposed to be about hope and courage and feminism thats a true disappointment. The story picks up after the cataclysmic events of the last film in which Katniss -- called upon to fight in modern gladiatorial combat for the amusement of a dystopian empire -- brought the games crashing down around her. Shes since been taken to the fabled District 13 an underground complex of ex-military leaders who have built an armory and an army and are waiting to lead the other districts in revolt. They just need a Joan of Arc and Katniss is made for the job -- or at least the propaganda videos. But the movie -- which obviously only covers part of the trilogys last book -- is all and only about that process. How Katniss at first resists the role. How shes coached to take it. How after seeing the effects of the Capitols attacks on the people she rises to it. Theres not much drama there. There is some humor as we see the good actress Jennifer Lawrence playing a bad one the late Philip Seymour Hoffman portraying a cranky director and a small bohemian crew of artistes (apparently even in the failing future hipsters still thrive) filming it all. But if you want drama and action -- and most especially Katniss in charge -- well buy another ticket next year. Jennifer Lawrence is back for the first half of Mockingjay but Katniss fearless leadership is absentLIONSGATE Whats here is amusing. Its also nice if bittersweet to see Hoffman again (the film is dedicated to him) Woody Harrelson shows up (too briefly) and Elizabeth Banks is back as Effie Trinket (even if her glitter-nails-on-a-chalkboard effect never appealed to me). And yes theres a lot of Lawrence crying and mooning over her truly beloved Josh Hutcherson (an attraction I confess I also never saw) and wondering what she should do. But this is never what I liked about ""The Hunger Games."" What I liked was a no-nonsense heroine a hunter a fighter a survivor. But who do we get here? At least twice big Liam Hemsworth has to pull Katniss out of harms way. The one time she goes into combat (and brings down a fighter plane with a single arrow) hes also there right next to her bringing down another. But when theres a big attack on a hydroelectric plant where is she? Back in the bunker. And when the rebels decide to launch a daring assault on the Capitol where is she? Back in the bunker. They may think they want a Joan of Arc but what the District 13 leaders really want is a symbol -- someone to cry on camera and sing sweet songs and give speeches. The real warriors are still the boys. Its true that the rebel leader here -- Julianne Moore in a wig that makes her look like Edgar Winter -- is a woman. And Lawrence still remains the lead and the films center and for an actress the opportunity to explore this character in a different context must have been appealing. But wheres the take-charge Katniss we fell for? I know of course that she begins the movie traumatized. I know shell be back next year in the films conclusion. I know that by cutting this last slim book in two the filmmakers ensured that all the buildup would come in Part 1 that all the action -- as Katniss finally soars back into combat -- would come later. But theres no reason this final book couldnt have been a single three-hour movie. No reason except the studios determination to squeeze every dollar out of the franchise -- even if it means delaying if not weakening the series positive message. And thats not a decision worthy of Katniss. Thats a decision worthy of President Snow. Ratings note The film contains violence and drug references.

Director Francis Lawrence. PG-13. There are moments when ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 1"" takes flight but overall this action-drama flits about wondering where to land. That leaves superstar Jennifer Lawrence shouldering the burden of lifting it aloft. Any fiery fierce moments in this cliffhanger franchise blockbuster are thanks to her. Readers of Suzanne Collins dystopian trilogy (the final edition has been split into two movies) know that the story is dour and despairing. Still this adaptation fails to get a grip on the muted murky proceedings. While its refreshing to not have more arena-set bloodletting in the futuristic fascistic U.S. known as Panem whats replaced it is dull speechifying and people staring at giant screens when they arent staring at rubble. When The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 1 threatens to succumb to sameness Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss draws us in with the power of her personality. (Murray Close/lionsgate) The latter is done by Katniss Everdeen (Lawrence) as she finds that her home District 12 was cruelly bombed by the Capitol and its evil President Snow (Donald Sutherland a white snake of devilry). The survivors including Gale (ever-dull Liam Hemsworth) live in the underground militaristic District 13 where Katniss was brought after she destroyed the arenas force field in the previous film ""Catching Fire."" In District 13 an insurgency against the Capitol is being planned. Rebel leader President Coin (Julianne Moore) and the Capitols ex-Gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee (the late Philip Seymour Hoffman) need Katniss to be the ""Mockingjay"" a symbol to spur Panems people to revolt. The survivors including Gale (ever-dull Liam Hemsworth) (left) live in the underground militaristic District 13 where Katniss was brought after she destroyed the arenas force field in the previous film Catching Fire. (Murray Close/lionsgate) The Capital however has their own symbol Katniss onetime partner-in-survival Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) now a pawn of evil president Snow whose fate preoccupies Katniss as the stakes grow larger. Director Francis Lawrence (no relation to the star) successfully upped the action ante in ""Fire"" but here seems to be marking time. The David-vs-Goliath storyline allows for Capitol jets to be taken down by Katniss exploding arrows yet what cant be captured is the epic genuinely scary tone established by the first ""Hunger Games"" (2012) a terrific sci-fi parable. The Capital however has their own symbol Katniss onetime partner-in-survival Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson pictured) now a pawn of evil president Snow whose fate preoccupies Katniss as the stakes grow larger. (Murray Close/Lionsgate) We do get more character turns as this franchise is to American indie actors what the ""Harry Potter"" films were to British thespians. Moore is coolly efficient and Hoffman is wily as her political consultant. The role of Katniss mentor Haymitch is still catnip to Woody Harrelson while Elizabeth Banks Stanley Tucci and Jeffrey Wright pop in quick turns. Natalie Dormer (""Game of Thrones"") comes aboard as Cressida a filmmaker escapee from the Capitol. Shes a welcome addition even though Cressidas propaganda commercials with Katniss become tiresome. Rebel leader President Coin (Julianne Moore) (pictured) and the Capitols ex-Gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee (the late Philip Seymour Hoffman) need Katniss to be the Mockingjay a symbol to spur Panems people to revolt. (Murray Close/lionsgate) More crucially there is a serious lack of action here which might be overlooked if the script were as smart as in the previous films. What passes for parable here is merely overplotting. Yet just when the film threatens to succumb to sameness Lawrence draws us in with the power of her personality. Always magnetic she gives Katniss a sparky soulfulness even when ""Mockingjay - Part 1"" feels like its winging it. Heres hoping ""Part II"" due next year flies higher. jneumaiernydailynews.com Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" throughout the day Thurs. - Sun. on New Yorks WOR 710 AM and at wor710.com.

Seriously stuff this bleak used to be in German or Japanese but now its lapped up by American kids whove finally gotten the message that whatevers coming isnt good. After nightmares and nightmares-within-nightmares Katniss heaves herself from her bed and trudges through the film on the brink of tears. Shes angry that the rebels abandoned her true love Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) in the fascist capital; angry that shes being used as a propaganda tool by the people shes angry at; and angry that she has to bargain with the chilly rebel president (Julianne Moore behind a sheet of white hair) who seems almost as much of a totalitarian creep as the wicked president (Donald Sutherland) who just incinerated her home district and more than 90 percent of its population. The film ends at the apex of anguish Thanks Lionsgate for cleaving Suzanne Collinss third book in twain to maximize your already staggering profits. Add to that the presence of Philip Seymour Hoffman -- reminding you yet again that the poor bastard went out at the peak of his talent -- and its tough to summon up the strength to say ""See it anyway. Its really good."" What works most smashingly is the movies meta side. Much of Mockingjay centers on selling. In the film the rebels sell a revolutionary icon Katniss in her Mockingjay wings clutching a bow and arrow. But its hard not to think -- Im pretty sure the screenwriters and director Francis Lawrence did -- of how Lionsgate is madly selling our nations No. 1 nobody-doesnt-love-her female movie star. (An inspired touch The rebels first commercial for the Mockingjay ends with the same whistled four-note motif that closes the Hunger Games previews.) The problem Katnisss handlers have is that shes too pure to strike phony heroic poses. When shes directed (by Hoffmans Plutarch Heavensbee the rebels media manager) to make like Liberty from the French Revolution she sounds like a bad high-school actress. Her former mentor Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) wanders in from rehab to suggest they get more Method-y and shoot her in the field whereupon shes placed in the hands of a film crew (the director is the delightful pert-faced Natalie Dormer) and told to do what comes naturally. Walking among the dead the dying the starving Katniss is suddenly every inch the Mockingjay of her publicists dreams the one who suffers and roars her defiance at President Snow wholl inspire the oppressed of the districts left standing to rise up and fight. The kicker is that underneath Katnisss genuine rage you also see her revulsion at helping turn tragedy into showbiz. A part with this much sobbing hand-wringing and mournful gazing into the middle distance could be in the wrong hands a laugh riot but Lawrences instincts are so smart that she never goes even a shade overboard. Shes a hell of an actress. Her adorable clumsiness in life suggests a reason shes convincing onscreen Spontaneity is all. She sings here in a lovely cracked voice with a touch of bluesiness sounding as unaffected as when she speaks. If only the Hunger Games movies could tap her comic gifts too. And if only her male-heartthrob co-stars gave more back. Liam Hemsworth has a big monologue in which he recounts the bombing of his district but all I could think was how slow he was saying his lines as if waiting for a flood of emotion that doesnt come. At least Josh Hutchersons captured Peeta is mostly seen in interviews with Stanley Tuccis camp talk-show host on TV screens (Peeta is being used as counter-propaganda) so the actor cant bring his lack of urgency to scenes with Katniss. In a harsh downbeat war film a few of the actors briefly lighten the mood. Elizabeth Banks returns as the chirpy escort/camp counselor Effie Trinket this time forced to wear a regulation gray rebel jumpsuit and no wig -- and mighty pissed off about it. Watch her tiny glance of horror at Moores non-coiffure and thank the gods of comedy for this tender mercy. I loved Sutherlands demonic smile whenever Katniss makes a new move In his psychotic way he loves her. Working beside the humorless rebel president Hoffmans Plutarch keeps his cards close to the vest. He muses he inveigles he tries to balance opportunism and decency. Hoffman underplays peerlessly layers of irony under layers of sincerity under layers of ... something unfathomable. The sting of his loss will never fade.

The incendiary female he refers to is Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) a victor in the last two Hunger Games and now a refugee from Panems President Snow (Donald Sutherland). Katnisss emotional temperature has cooled; shes dazed and confused depressed and logy and so is The Hunger Games Mockingjay--Part 1 the third in a four-movie adaptation of Suzanne Collins YA trilogy. The first two Hunger Games installments earned more than 1.5 billion at the worldwide box office so the new films makers--director Francis Lawrence and screenwriters Peter Craig and Danny Strong--dispense with a lengthy recap of the story thus far. Katniss simply whispers a skeletal precis of the plot in the first 15 seconds. In a sentence War is on; shes in the underground District 13; and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) her Games co-victor and public boyfriend is Snows captive and counterrevolutionary mouthpiece back in the Capitol. O.K. now what? Not much. In the greed-is-good tradition of the Harry Potter and Twilight movie franchises the overseers of The Hunger Games have split the last book into two films. You may recall that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 was the only lame episode in the entire canon and that Mary Pols titled her TIME review of the penultimate Twilight film ""Breaking Yawn Part 1."" Expectations for the artistic and entertainment possibilities of this half-Mockingjay should be at least as low though its likely to be the top-grossing movie of 2014. Hundreds of millions of people will go see it in the same way reluctant Catholics used to attend Sunday Mass under threat of the mortal sin of having to confess you skipped it. For a start in this Hunger Games there are no Hunger Games. The Survivor-for-real televised spectacle which started with 24 young contestants and meant to kill off 23 has been called because of war. And war games arent much fun especially when Mockingjay Part 1 allows for only one massing of troops one ISIS-style public execution of hooded men and one Navy SEALs-ish guerrilla raid in which Katniss takes no part. Shes back at District 13 HQ being schooled in the art of the propaganda video or ""propo"" by Plutarch costume adviser Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) and Katnisss old coach Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson). If The Hunger Games series were an actual dystopian reality show now available on DVD Mockingjay Part 1 would be the making-of extra. Were backstage with the star Katniss as she tries to rally rebels in other districts against the fatherly despot Snow. Like a famous athlete trying to make a public-service commercial she looks stiff and sounds shrill when the cameras roll. Wearing eye makeup that even a Kardashian would find excessive Katniss is a genuine military leader who cant play one on TV. Not until she ventures aboveground and sees Snows air force bomb a District 13 hospital does she explode into telegenic fury and make her big Joan of Arc speech proclaiming for all the districts to hear ""If we burn you burn with us."" Effie for one feels the magic. ""Everybodys gonna wanna kiss you kill you or be you"" she tells Katniss. ""Everything old can be made new again. Like democracy."" There might be some pizzazz or at least some satiric bustle in these scenes but theyre infected by Katnisss dyspepsia. Shes in mourning for her lost Peeta or maybe for the zippy woodland capers of the first two movies. The District 13 decor is drab almost colorless and the bad-taste splendor and gaudy gowns of the second episode Catching Fire have given way to a Stalinist poverty of the visual imagination. Even glam-gal Effie sports the ""no-makeup"" makeup look and her stab at making Katniss the best-dressed rebel in history falls far behind Che Guevaras fatigues as a fashion statement. So you hope for some erotic crackle between Katniss and her brace of swains. Her old beau Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth) should have pride of place; hes strong and sensitive and doesnt take advantage of Peetas absence to press his affections. Yet Katniss gives him just one soft kiss and that he cant help noting is ""because Im in pain. Thats the only way I can get your attention."" Our heroines guilt over leaving Peeta behind--even though or especially because hes been turned into a counterrevolutionary mouthpiece for Snow--overwhelms her fondness for Gale. Why would that be? Fess up Hunger Games fans Does anyone care about Peeta or find him attractive? Hes the Ron Weasley of the series he gets points for callow valor and sympathy for his run of bad luck but he remains a pasty earnest bore. (Contrarian opinions are welcome in the Comments section.) As in The Hunger Games and its first sequel Mockingjay Part 1 springs to life around the 80-minute mark. Hearing a flock of mockingjays chirp overhead Katniss sings a folk-song dirge ""The Hanging Tree"" which builds into a stirring thumping chorale and leads to some long-promised action sequences. But the number has no more impact than (as Gale observes sourly) ""a fight song at a funeral."" Its certainly not enough to make this film more than a placeholder for the finale Mockingjay Part 2 which is expected to hit theaters on Nov. 25 2015. The distinguished actors including Oscar winners Lawrence and Hoffman often deliver their dialogue in a flat disengaged tone as if at a first reading. And though we still believe that Lawrence who turned 24 in August can do no wrong she isnt given much opportunity to do anything spectacularly right here. Her performance is a medley of sobs and gasps in mournful or radiant closeup. This time her Katniss is as much a prisoner of her circumstances as Peeta is. She and the movie are both victims of burnout. ""Its the worst terror in the world"" President Coin tells Katniss ""waiting for something."" The two-hour foot-soldier slog through Mockingjay Part 1 forces audiences into mostly wasteful waiting for something special to happen. Coin and her idealistic minions have hurt Katniss in a way President Snow barely dreamed of by turning this military heroine into a celebrity spokeswoman. The same goes for Collins and the films makers they created the most popular activist-heroine in modern movies--with one of the biggest most gifted and appealing stars in the world--and make her sit this one out.

By chopping the trilogys final book into two this second-to-last film should be more drag than drama - the cash-machine episode that everyone knows is just a teaser for next years epic send-off. And while it definitely takes its foot off the action Mockingjay - Part 1 goes deeper and darker. Any darker theyd have to give out Prozac with the popcorn or offer counselling to traumatised 13-year-olds. The story begins in rebellious District 13 whose commanders rescued Katniss from the Quarter Quell games at the end of the last film. Rioting has broken out in several districts and 13s icy leader Alma Coin (Julianne Moore with a terrifying side-parting) wants Katniss to be the poster girl of the revolution. With no fight-to-the-death games in this episode and just a handful of not-stunning set pieces Jennifer Lawrences bow and arrow take a back seat to her acting. This is no bad thing her soulful storm-raging performance is the best thing about the series. Mockingjay is Katnisss coming-of-age film as she wrestles with her role in the armed struggle against the totalitarian Capitol. District 13 might be the good guys but Katniss is suspicious of Alma Coin and her slippery spin doctor Plutarch Heavensbee played by the mighty late Philip Seymour Hoffman. Katniss understands the need for PR. As she heads on to the battlefield someone asks her What if you die? She snaps back Make sure you get it on camera. As its Che Guevara Katniss is worth as much to the rebellion - if not more - dead.Over in the Capitol Santas evil twin President Snow (Donald Sutherland) is having poor Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) tortured. (If the beatings werent bad enough look at the sheeny-shiny white power suits they make him wear on TV.) For a franchise with bang-on casting the chemistry between Katniss and Peeta has always been a bit limp so there are no complaints here about keeping them apart. Besides Katniss has the infinitely less lame Gale (Liam Hemsworth) to take hunting.The politics of Mockingjay are as intensely gripping as the games in the earlier films - and more deadly. And for a film targeting teen girls who will be half-watching half-texting their mates to tell them that theyre watching Mockingjay might just have more to say about the ethical ambiguities of war than Brad Pitts pseudo-thinking war drama Fury (the books author Suzanne Collins is an army brat). Is the fight against the Capitol unavoidable? Can the rebels be trusted to do the right thing if they take power? And best of all in Katniss The Hunger Games has one of the all-time great heroines strong smart stubborn angry and full of heart.

Katniss Everdeen becomes the face of a revolution in ""Mockingjay -- Part 1"" a tricky transitional episode of ""The Hunger Games"" franchise that abandons the reality-TV bloodsports of the first two movies to conjure a dour grimly escalating vision of all-out war. Unsubtly resonant at times quite rousing and somewhat unsatisfying by design this penultimate series entry is a tale of mass uprising and media manipulation that itself evinces no hint of a rebellious streak or subversive spirit Suzanne Collins novels may have warned against the dangers of giving the masses exactly what they want to see but at this point the forces behind this hugely commercial property are not about to risk doing anything but. Its a sensible if not exactly inspired strategy and with Jennifer Lawrence once more carrying the proceedings and director Francis Lawrence (no relation) dutifully replicating the elements of an inherently cinematic story Lionsgates plans for worldwide B.O. domination look secure. For the millions who have devoured Collins bestselling trilogy and are awaiting this movie with an obsessive fervor equal to that of the most rabid ""Harry Potter"" and ""Twilight"" fans (who also had to see their beloved franchises end on a maddening two-part note) the only real source of suspense here lies in the crucial question of where exactly Collins story has been cleaved in two. Rest assured the decision has been made with near-Solomonic wisdom allowing for just enough incident to sustain this relatively trim two-hour setup until its quasi-cliffhanger of an ending while leaving several big twists to come in ""Part 2"" (due out Nov. 25 2015) along with a presumably epic final showdown. Audiences coming to this film with no prior knowledge of the material however may feel their patience squeezed and their appetite for action a bit neglected; following the bright-hued battle-royale spectacle of its predecessors ""Mockingjay"" reveals a darkening shift in mood emphasis and color palette as it decisively exits the arena and literally burrows underground. After shooting the fateful arrow that brought the Quarter Quell edition of the Hunger Games to a tumultuous close in ""Catching Fire"" Katniss (Lawrence) was rescued and brought to the ultra-secret District 13 a large gray-walled subterranean bunker that houses a growing movement bent on uniting the other districts of Panem and overthrowing the Capitol and its totalitarian President Snow (Donald Sutherland marvelously menacing as ever). The leader of the uprising is the poised formidable President Coin (Julianne Moore who seems to have taken hairstyling tips from Meryl Streep in ""The Giver"") who urges Katniss to officially embrace her role as the Mockingjay the rebellions fiery feathered figurehead. As masterminded by Coins media-savvy associate Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman in his second-to-last bigscreen appearance) Katniss will be sent into the war zone to star in a series of propaganda videos or ""propos"" designed to go viral (or its nearest Panem equivalent) and further stoke the fires of revolution across the nation. As ever complications emerge stemming from our heroines indeterminate romantic feelings toward the noble self-sacrificing Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) her two-time partner in the Games and her public love interest. Now being held at their Capitol Peeta is regularly trotted out on live TV to be interviewed by the smarmy Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci seeming ever more like Regis Philbins evil twin) where under duress he urges Katniss to quell the uprising; clearly Snow and his regime are trying to take down the Mockingjay by dangling their own reluctant mascot in front of the camera. To the understandable chagrin of her longtime companion Gale (Liam Hemsworth) who has bravely joined the fight against the Capitol Katniss seems more invested in Peetas safety than anything else including the success of their cause. Like the novel the screenplay (penned by franchise newcomers Peter Craig and Danny Strong) ably conjoins elements of political thriller combat movie and mass-media satire weaving a dense network of unsteady alliances secret conspiracies ratings-minded power plays and the always-knotty entanglements of love and war. It helps that some of Collins storytelling devices particularly her critical inquiry into the temptations of overnight fame and the uses and abuses of televised propaganda feel naturally suited to the screen -- a fact that director Lawrence and his ""Catching Fire"" d.p. Jo Willems have exploited to canny effect. An early sequence finds Katniss stumbling through what remains of her home village of District 12 which Snows forces reduced to rubble in the wake of her escape from the arena; its a picture of bombed-out skull-ridden horror worthy of Vereschagins ""Apotheosis of War"" and other visions of hell on earth. Fortunately there are welcome if fleeting moments of levity as well mostly courtesy of Katniss temporarily sober mentor Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) and her once colorfully coiffed now plainly dressed escort Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) whose expanded role here represents the films most significant deviation from the novel. Their attempts to turn the initially stiff camera-shy Katniss into a poster girl for the rebellion provide some gentle amusement until Haymitch realizes that this Mockingjay cant be trained to perform on cue Its only after she sees Capitol planes bomb a crowded District 8 hospital that Katniss guilt and devastation spur her into a moment of genuine articulate fury. ""If we burn you burn with us"" she tells her enemies in no uncertain terms coining what will become a mantra for the revolution as dramatized in stirring sweepingly effective sequences of the other districts rising up and causing untold damage to the Capitol. Those brief flare-ups of action -- including a daring high-tech mission to rescue Peeta and the other surviving Quarter Quell tributes from the Capitol -- bring a few frissons of suspense to a tale that otherwise operates in a downbeat claustrophobic register sustained by the unrelenting pallor of Willems studiously underlit images and production designer Philip Messinas purely functional-looking sets for District 13. Gone are the first two films riotous colors and outre fashions; the duo of Kurt and Bart handled the more restrained costume-design duties this time around their chief contribution being the sleek black combat gear that Katniss wears for her appearances as the Mockingjay. Even composer James Newton Howards usual themes take a backseat to a haunting childhood song that Katniss croons at the films midpoint; its not long before her allies are humming the same tune as they march on Snows empire. In short all talents involved seem to have marshaled their significant resources in service of an ever bleaker and more serious-minded portrait of geopolitical conflict replete with topical parallels (long-range missile attacks the deliberate targeting of civilian refugees) that cut even closer to home than the filmmakers may have intended -- never more than when Snow orders live broadcasts of public executions in each district the heads of the condemned covered in black hoods. But while helmer Lawrence maintains a steadily absorbing control of the storys pace tone and ever-increasing dramatic stakes the downside of his fidelity to Collins novel (the author even gets an ""adaptation by"" credit this time around) is that the film never shakes off a safe-and-steady by-the-book feel or an unfortunate tendency to spell out the obvious. (When Peeta sends Katniss an unmistakable warning someone helpfully notes ""That was a warning."") For all its obvious smarts and mildly provocative ideas ""Mockingjay"" doesnt seem to trust its audience quite as much as it clearly trusts its heroine. If Katniss remains only intermittently comfortable with her celebrity Jennifer Lawrence herself feels like more of a natural than ever. Although she has less to do on the action front (she fires only one arrow and its a doozy) her Katniss remains the most compellingly human fixture of this dystopian landscape even when the psychological toll of her sufferings push the performance into a shriekier more desperate emotional register than before. Some of that is due not only to Katniss feelings for Peeta but also to her concern for her loving but weak-willed mother (Paula Malcomson) and especially her younger sister Prim (Willow Shields more prominent here than in the earlier films) laying the emotional groundwork for events still to come. Jena Malone has a blink-and-you-miss-it appearance as ferocious fighter Johanna Mason while Sam Claflin superbly introduced in ""Catching Fire"" as Katniss handsome arena ally Finnick Odair tempers his devilish charisma here to reveal the characters wounded vulnerable side even if the sequence that lays bare his most startling revelations is muddled by excessive cross-cutting (a split-screen approach might have worked better). Hutcherson and Hemsworth continue to be unexceptionally fine; British actress Natalie Dormer reps a strong addition as Katniss shrewd propo director Cressida; and the older stalwarts in the cast -- including Hoffman Harrelson Banks Tucci Sutherland and Jeffrey Wright (as technical whiz Beetee Latier) -- again bring a crucial measure of grown-up authority to the YA proceedings. On that score Moores Coin unsurprisingly emerges as the ensembles MVP her steely intelligence and no-nonsense leadership marking her as yet another manifestation of the franchises refreshing gender politics even as the film slyly encourages us not to judge her or her subordinates by the apparent righteousness of their cause. That power cannot help but corrupt is among Collins more potent themes (hinted at here in shots of a District 13 rally that cant help but evoke ""Triumph of the Will"") but one likely to be explored in greater depth -- and ideally with a freer hand -- when ""Mockingjay -- Part 2"" arrives at this time next year.

(including me) there is hardly any action in part one for a reason and that reason is were watching Katniss get used to her surroundings and get used to living in district 13. the viewers have to try to imagine what it would be like to be mentally disorientated and have their true love (Peeta Mellark) brainwashed and set to kill you. if you have read the books like i have then you would understand more about what is going on and what will happen in part two. Peeta has also had tracker jacker venon injected into him and he has also been tortured so he has been through a lot of pain and Katniss is getting upset all the time because of it. Its a really sad movie to be honest and if it is not your type of movie genre then that is fine but please dont insult a well made movie like that. i hope you will change your thoughts about this movie soon. thank you for your consideration. ~BB Reply JS says February 7 2015 at 1236 pm dear Bethan.. just because a film costs N hundred million dollars and a thousand people work really hard for it it doesnt mean its going to be a good film. you know why? because there is a very small creative team the writer the director some producers a few people involved in major decision-making. and they can go very wrong and very possibly nobody can tell them theyre wrong. its the case with the hunger games series. Im watching this for the sake of the visual spectacle but my brain hurts and revolts against how wrong everything is about this film. its a film made by grown-up-children who are still children in fact and dont understand anything about anything basically. Don Yu says November 29 2014 at 1200 am I cant tell if this is a positive review or a negative review. But if you are a fan of character development you should love this movie. You cant have more action when it dont exist. And if you dont cut it in half it will be a 4 and half hours movie. Reply guest2.0 says November 23 2014 at 1104 pm the downfall of this movie was the fact that they split it into two parts. The ending felt unfinished and like little thought was put into it and thats because it was unfinished since they decided to split the movie. The movie became repetitive and one of the only actions scenes mounted up to nothing since they didnt show how peeta was rescued after they sneaked into a very vulnerable capital. It wasnt a bad movie but it is just a could had been a good movie if it was simply not split into two parts. Reply any says November 23 2014 at 803 pm It was not a good movie I love 1 and 2 but this one was the worst 15 dollars I spent -( Reply Yawn says November 15 2014 at 938 pm ""With the birth of the artist comes the afterbirth of the critic"" Mel Brooks Reply LOL says November 11 2014 at 305 pm I fell asleep reading this review. Must have been because of the nature of what is being reviewed by the otherwise fine Justin Chang. Reply Thomas says November 11 2014 at 257 pm Jennifer Lawrence is phenomenal and deserves at least an Oscar nomination for Mockingjay Part 1 and then fingers crossed for Mockingjay Part 2 which is going to be even bigger darker and an Oscar nomination would be a perfect conclusion with this incredible heroine who is making and will continue to make history...and a great victory for women (Sigourney Weaver was nominated for Alien so why cant Katniss Everdeen the biggest heroine of all time be too?). Especially this year that the Best Actress category is so weak... Reply rjbailey says November 10 2014 at 453 pm Reblogged this on Locating Frankensteins Brain.

Daily Edition Login to download The Hunger Games Mockingjay a Part 1 Film Review 359 PM PST 11/10/2014 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS The first half of the final Hunger Games installment is disappointingly bland and unnecessarily protracted TWITTER Katniss is molded into a revolutionary in this first half of the Hunger Games series final installment Like an overgrown and bloated trailer for a film yet to come Francis Lawrences The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 1 spreads perhaps 45 minutes of dramatic material across two far-too-leisurely hours. The final installment of Suzanne Collins blockbuster trilogy wasnt naturally designed to be broken down into two segments. However after the producers of the Harry Potter and Twilight series doubled their financial pleasure by dividing those series climactic stories into two distinct films how was Lionsgate to resist doing the same with its own gold mine given that the two previous Katniss chronicles have together grossed more than 1.5 billion worldwide? It isnt that its disagreeable to be reunited with the resourceful resilient and attractive characters in this series especially now that the Hunger Games themselves are history and a revolutionary spirit has seized the downtrodden masses of Panem. This first half of the big-screen version of the oft-derided Mockingjay novel is essentially devoted to the rebel leaders efforts to transform Katniss into their standard bearer and make her the focal point of their propaganda. Up to a point this process is engaging and somewhat amusing even if a little dialectical montage would have been welcome along the way just for fun. Unfortunately Mockingjay -- Part 1 has all the personality of an industrial film. Theres not a drop of insolence insubordination or insurrection running through its veins; it feels like a manufactured product through and through ironic and sad given its revolutionary theme. Read more Hunger Games Stage Show Set for Summer 2016 Unlike its outdoorsy predecessors this franchise installment is mostly confined to quarters -- notably the secret bunker-like headquarters of District 13 a hotbed of revolt led by its president Alma Coin (Julianne Moore). In league with turncoat Capitol game-maker Plutarch (Philip Seymour Hoffman to whom the film is dedicated) and wheelchair-bound high-tech wiz and hacker Beetee (Jeffrey Wright) the president aims to galvanize the surviving citizens of all the districts to overthrow the ever-devious President Snow (Donald Sutherland) once and for all. This state of affairs is new to Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence all of 23 when this was shot) who awakens from the trauma of what we saw her endure last year to be faced not only with underground confinement but the apparent betrayal of Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). In a series of broadcast interviews with the emotionally manipulative Caesar (Stanley Tucci) the unlikely young survivor appears drugged brainwashed or both as he warns against civil war and urges the rebels to agree to a cease-fire. Relieved that her friend is still alive but dismayed by his words Katniss is taken to view the rubble that is her native District 12 in hopes of stoking her revolutionary fervor. By her side again are the ever-ardent Gale (Liam Hemsworth); Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) now sober and with little to do; and Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) whose insatiable need for high style and glamor are amusingly stymied by the militaristic drabness of District 13. Given more opportunity here than in the two previous films Banks gamely pushes the role into quasi-Oscar Wildean territory. Its up to all of these characters to mold Katniss into ""the face of the revolution"" and the films most entertaining moments portray their efforts to goose prod and provoke the resourceful warrior into becoming a cross between Joan of Arc and Marianne Frances symbol of la liberte. It doesnt come naturally as Katniss initial attempts at inspirational calls to storm the barricades wouldnt pass muster in a high school play. But the galvanizing moments eventually arrive as do some testy televised exchanges between Katniss and Snow; the latter may be under assault but always seems to have more cards to play. Read more Lordes Hunger Games Mockingjay Soundtrack to Feature Kanye West Charli XCX The central challenge faced by new-to-the-series screenwriters Peter Craig and Danny Strong was to bring the story to the brink of the inevitable confrontation between the oppressors and the oppressed. From a dramatic point of view this would have ideally occupied either the initial third or first half lets say of a 140-minute movie which would have then continued to accelerate toward cathartic action and ultimate resolution. As things stand however audiences are left at the edge of a cliff for another year -- until November 2015 to be precise -- when Part 2 of Mockingjay will be released. To be sure massive audiences will turn out this year as well as next. But far more than with Harry Potter and about the same as with Twilight this doubling-the-profit gambit feels like a gaming-the-public ploy.

Bringing aboard Danny Strong (who co-adapts Suzanne Collins novel with Peter Craig of ""The Town"") was a wise move; Strong after all has shown a gift for taking the big ideas of politics and historical sweep and slicing them down to bite-size chunks first in the HBO movies ""Recount"" and ""Game Change"" and then on the big screen with ""Lee Daniels The Butler."" See photos The Hunger Games Mockingjay Posters Feature Rebel Leaders Liam Hemsworth Natalie Dormer ""Mockingjay Part 1"" is still very much a ""Hunger Games"" movie yes but it calls to mind smart political comedies like ""Wag the Dog"" and ""Tanner 88"" as well. Fair-weather fans of the franchise might want to re-watch ""Catching Fire"" or at least peruse the films Wikipedia page before taking in this latest entry which gets straight to business without the courtesy of a ""Previously on..."" Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) has been rescued from the games by Plutarch (the late Philip Seymour Hoffman to whom the film is dedicated) but shes upset about the other competitors left behind particularly Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). Also read Hunger Games Villain Donald Sutherland Landed His Part Only After Writing a Letter to Films Director Its in his absence that Katniss realizes that the ""show-mance"" they concocted to stay alive in the Games may well have turned out to be the real thing; not even the presence of her childhood pal Gale (Liam Hemsworth) can keep her from fretting about Peetas safety. Katniss and her family are now underground in the bunker that is District 13 where a rebel army run by Boggs (Mahershala Ali ""House of Cards"") has been entrenching itself and biding its time waiting to unite the districts to overthrow the evil President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and the entire Capitol which exploits the resources of the districts. Rebel leader Alma Coin (Julianne Moore with a Susan Sontag streak in her hair) thinks that Katniss and the symbol of the Mockingjay are the only hope of keeping the spirit of rebellion alive. Early attempts to shoot staged propaganda around Katniss are a disaster but the now-sober Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) suggests that she leave the studio and go out into the world where she can be spontaneous. Her interaction with the people leads to some powerful moments captured on camera by director Cressida (Natalie Dormer ""Game of Thrones"") but President Snow has his own spokesman -- Peeta who urges the rebels to stand down. If youve read the books you know whats coming and if you havent theres no point in spoiling anything. Suffice it to say that while ""Mockingjay Part 1"" might not be as consistently thrilling as ""Catching Fire"" -- the second movie always has the luxury of being all PBamp;J and no crust -- its the movie equivalent of a page-turner consistently suspenseful and filled with surprises and illuminating character moments. The series has let us know these people well enough by this point that its just fun to watch for details like how Effie (Elizabeth Banks) manages to improvise her usual over-the-top couture out of the dull grey jumpsuits that are the uniform of District 13. Its the kind of fashion savvy that prison drag queens and Little Edie Beale alike would admire. See video Hunger Games Mockingjay Clip Jennifer Lawrence Meets Game of Thrones Star Natalie Dormer Returning director Francis Lawrence finds interesting visual moments even in the underground bunker. At one point Katniss looks down on rows and rows of rebels climbing down down down a metallic triangular staircase and its like something out of ""Metropolis."" Thats a pretty bold quotation to make for a film thats also about a proletariat revolution but even if ""Mockingjay"" isnt on the level of that silent classic its not an altogether inappropriate reference point. The title lets you know were still one more movie away from the grand finale but even if ""Mockingjay Part 1"" leaves us wanting more its not just two hours of build-up. Think of it as an amuse-bouche for a final course that manages to satisfy on its own. Breaking News To Your Inbox.
