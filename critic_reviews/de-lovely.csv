The clunky self-conscious flashback structure certainly isnt one of them playing out biographical highlights in the form of an unfolding revue watched by the ailing elderly Porter (Kevin Kline) with an angel named Gabe (Jonathan Pryce) by his side. Unlike the much-maligned 1946 biopic Night and Day with Cary Grant this one doesnt whitewash out its subjects homosexuality as the heart of the piece is the loving understanding between Porter and his socialite wife Linda (Ashley Judd) that the companionship in their union would involve a certain sexual tolerance. Jay Cocks stilted script notwithstanding the two performers bring genuine emotional complexity to their roles enough to have you re-interpreting lyrics of for instance What Is This Thing Called Love? to insinuate both the unique contours of their marriage and an explicitly gay romantic yearning.Kline and Judd deserve a movie to themselves but unfortunately the producers have made the disastrous calculation that therell be no audience for a Cole Porter flick unless his songs are murdered by a galaxy of todays top pop talent. Thus Robbie Williams Elvis Costello Sheryl Crow Alanis Morrisette and company effortfully grind the great mans exquisite lines to mulch in a series of production numbers awkwardly semi-integrated into the drama. Perhaps Baz Luhrmann might have brought the requisite dash to pull this off but in Winklers hands everyones trying so desperately hard to have a swelegant time of it the strain is painfully apparent. Like a badly mixed Martini its obvious throughout the blend just isnt right.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

RELATED  Kevin Kline Dont call him stupid call him smooth YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Ashley Judd Cole Porter Kevin Kline or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? (CNN) -- The new musical ""De-Lovely"" about the life of the legendary Cole Porter is a mixed bag. The music of course is wonderful the costumes are exquisite and both Kevin Kline as Porter and Ashley Judd as his wife Linda are terrific in their roles. But the films structure seems disjointed at times and the audience never feels the actual danger that Porter was in at that time in history by being so blatant regarding his homosexuality despite being married.Spanning nearly 40 years the story is told in flashback. We meet Porter as an old man bitter and broken by life. Jonathan Pryce playing Gabe a theatrical producer staging a play about the composer transports the dying man to an empty theater where together they watch his life -- and his music -- unfold. All the key players in his life appear as well as numerous appearances by contemporary singers performing many of his most memorable songs. (Elvis Costello sings ""Lets Misbehave"" Alanis Morissette sings ""Lets Do It Lets Fall In Love"" and Diana Krall takes on ""I Get A Kick Out Of You"" to name just a few.) In all parts of nearly 30 tunes are scattered throughout the film. Kline no stranger to musicals also performs as does Judd who sings ""True Love."" In fact Kline performed his songs live -- refusing to lip-sync -- and did not pre-record them which is the way most musicals are done.Porter who was born wealthy lived the life of a jet-setter before jets were invented. He traveled through various European capitals during the Jazz Age and cavorted openly with many men. Then he met Linda Lee in Paris and the two forged a deep relationship that apparently had nothing to do with any type of sexual involvement. Together the two traveled from Europe to America from Broadway to Hollywood in one seemingly endless party. Through it all Porter who was unapologetically promiscuous continued having sexual relationships with men prompting Linda to flee back to Paris. Then in the late 30s Porter had a tragic accident while horseback riding and Linda returned to his side. The songwriter was crippled for the next 27 years and endured excruciating pain but still wrote some of the most memorable music of the 20th century. ""De-Lovely"" is full of performance cameos such as Elvis Costello doing ""Lets Misbehave.""Director-producer Irwin Winkler won an Oscar for producing ""Rocky"" (1976); his other producing credits include ""Raging Bull"" (1980) and ""Goodfellas"" (1990). His directing efforts include ""Life As A House"" (2003) which also starred Kline. Obviously Winkler likes stories about people with strong relationship issues in their lives and ""De-Lovely"" is no exception. At its heart this film is a love story one made all the more potent by Porters music. The Porters were anything but conventional and their love for each other followed suit. But ""De-Lovely"" is also a story about the love of music and the magic of lyrics.Still ""De-Lovely"" has its flaws. That disjointed structure gives short shrift to some of the darker aspects of Porters life -- his clever upbeat music could stand in sharp contrast to the man writing it -- which prevents the movie from being as well-rounded as it could have been. Nevertheless this elegant production beautifully captures a time and place that no longer exists -- and perhaps never did -- except in song.""De-Lovely"" opened in limited release on Friday July 2 and expands to more markets throughout July.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

Its 1964 and a man named Gabe (Jonathan Pryce) has invited him to an empty theater where he intends to put on a play about Porters life. Cole is about to experience the highlights of his life particularly his relationship with his wife Linda Porter (Ashley Judd) in a stage play. <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=howenode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;dir=howe;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;ad=hp;pos=ad26;sz=300x250;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1088755394844?""></a> <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=howenode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;dir=howe;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;ad=hp;pos=ad27;sz=160x600;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1088755394845?""></a> <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=howenode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;dir=howe;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;ad=hp;pos=ad24;sz=336x850;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1088755394845?""></a> His life actually is rendered as a movie. And as we watch a series of extended flashbacks Coles comments directed at Gabe punctuate those memories. It would take a powerful movie to transcend this stagy conceit but ""De-Lovely"" doesnt have the muster. Despite a subject of immense potential -- a womans marriage to one of the great songwriters whose sexual orientation forced him into a tortured double life -- the movies surprisingly uninvolving. As the older Cole Porter Kline just looks like an actor in old mans makeup talking in a feebler voice. And Pryce suggests an off-kilter host simply there for screenwriter Jay Cockss construct. The flashback scenes which cover 40 years of Porters life never rise above the canned poignancy of a bio-film. When Linda Lee known as Pariss most beautiful divorcee meets Cole in the City of Light its love at first one-liner. He delights her with his wickedly brilliant compositions chutzpah and debonair charm. ""You have so much nerve Mr. Porter"" she coos admiringly as he invites her to a highly public dance in a restaurant before dinner patrons and of course smiling staff. She signs on for a dubious deal. Determined to help Cole bring his music to wider audience recognition but aware that his sexual taste is directed toward men she agrees to marry him. Its a deal that seems doomed to fail but she signs on for a lifetime. Linda turns a blind eye to Coles extracurricular pursuits as much as she can focusing on supporting and appreciating her husbands career and music. He soon becomes revered on Broadway. After that MGM head Louis B. Mayer (Peter Polycarpou) invites him to pen musicals for the studio. But inevitably Coles physical passions put a great strain on Linda. She leaves him. But after he sustains a debilitating injury in a horse-riding accident and his career momentum stalls she decides to return to the original game plan. The movie has a surface appeal particularly in the good years before Kline and Judd have to wear aging makeup. The decor is nicely done. Everyones dressed very Fred and Ginger. And Kline is debonair and striking. But as the drama moves to its minor key and Coles music and relationship with Linda take a fall the movie sickens and passes away. Judd who fares better as a younger woman is hard to accept in her portrayal of the older Linda. Shes got vigor and dedication perhaps but not the gravitas. The screenplay does her no favors either. Theres no space for her to expand past the role of anguished lip-biting supporter. In the end we have only Porters fabulous music interpreted in passing cameos by a number of artists including Natalie Cole Alanis Morissette Elvis Costello and Sheryl Crow. Everyone will appreciate these versions differently but it seems fair to say that some are better than others. The unfortunate irony is that the musicians put far more zest into the movie than Cocks director Irwin Winkler and the dramatic performers ever do. Were left to appreciate Porters wittiness and musical delicacy in abstraction while we gamely endure the movies misfired attempts to evoke and honor the man. And when Natalie Cole sings the lyric ""Every time we say goodbye I die a little"" shes giving unintentionally ironic commentary on whats happening to the movie.

Its defects lie mostly in failing to fully delineate what made musical icon Cole Porter tick. Kevin Kline is no slouch when it comes to singing having appeared in Pirates of Penzance. MGM Pictures Perhaps the movie is deliberately evasive. But because Porter wrote some of Broadway and Hollywoods wittiest lyrics one would hope a biopic of the man would be at least as clever. Kevin Kline does a fine job portraying Porter as hes written. But the script is missing much of the complexity and some of the humanity of the composer one of the greats of the 20th century. De-Lovely is primarily about Porters extraordinary relationship with his wife Linda Lee Porter played by Ashley Judd in one of her best roles since her debut in 1993s Ruby in Paradise. The title of one of Porters biggest hits Anything Goes would be an apt description of Cole and Lindas unorthodox marital arrangement. As she puts it ""You like men better than I do."" Though she seems uncommonly accepting of Porters homosexuality his trysts eventually drive a wedge between them. A highlight of the film is the collection of classic Porter songs performed by an array of contemporary pop and jazz artists including Elvis Costello Alanis Morissette Sheryl Crow and Natalie Cole. But those moments dont quite gel with the clunkily constructed conceit Porter is dying (or perhaps already dead) and a director/angel named Gabe (a character possibly inspired by a Porter lyric in True Love about a guardian angel) is guiding him through his wonderful life envisioned as a Broadway musical. ABOUT THE MOVIE De-Lovely   1/2 (out of four) Stars Kevin Kline Ashley Judd Jonathan Pryce Director Irwin Winkler Distributor MGM Rating PG-13 for sexual content Opens Friday in select cities Gabe (Jonathan Pryce) pops in and out of the film at unexpected times and though Pryce handles the role deftly enough it feels forced. Sometimes hes there to focus our attention on the tragedies that befall Porter (a fall from a horse that cripples him); other times he seems a device to draw attention to Porters double life. With Gabes help Porter looks back ruefully on his career-- his triumphs excesses and regrets. Viewers might be put off by Klines efforts to sing as Cole Porter -- who was not known for his pipes -- particularly because the highly versatile Kline has proved himself an accomplished musical theater performer and talented singer. (Remember Pirates of Penzance?) But in his quest for authenticity he uses a voice that might grate on audiences. Still Kline and Judd give strong performances. Irwin Winklers direction and Jay Cocks superficial script just dont measure up. Guess it was just one of those things.

Directed by Irwin Winkler from a screenplay by Jay Cocks. 124 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sexual content. Pacific Place. In the movies these days you can show almost anything -- people crawling up and down the sides of buildings tidal waves crashing over Manhattan an Olsen twin in a towel. But theres still one big taboo singing in the old-fashioned lets-put-on-a-musical kind of way. And thats what makes Irwin Winklers Cole Porter biopic ""De-Lovely"" an unapologetically old-fashioned film so refreshing. It celebrates words and music and the emotions they evoke. Though its execution occasionally stumbles the film is a sleek elegy for a time long gone -- and for an art form that still survives. Though ""Chicago"" burned up the box office in late 2002 the anticipated movie-musicals boomlet still hasnt arrived perhaps because musicals that dont feature Catherine Zeta-Jones in fishnet stockings continue to be a tough sell. Now comes ""De-Lovely"" and its got little of ""Chicagos"" sex appeal. Rather its a mostly faithful impressionistic biography as composer Porter (Kevin Kline) looks back on his eventful life staged as a musical and presented in a dream sequence introduced by a mysterious gentleman (Jonathan Pryce). This is about as high-concept as film biographies get and while it provides some colorful opportunities for Winkler to stage musical numbers its kind of a cumbersome way to get the songs worked in. (""Chicago"" employed a similar fantasy-sequence tactic for its musical numbers. It works but sometimes you yearn for a movie like the musicals of old or like Woody Allens ""Everyone Says I Love You"" in which people just sing without a lot of fuss and apology.) Anyway Porters songs add depth and dimension to ""De-Lovely"" like twinkling stars in a twilight sky. And Klines performance as Porter feels exactly right. Though he looks nothing like the historical Porter (a rather squat wide-eyed fellow) hes got the kind of formality -- that clipped precise diction -- that perfectly suits a man of Porters class and time. The composer was a complicated man -- a seemingly happy husband whose homosexuality was an open secret; a wealthy man who nonetheless constantly worried about having enough money; an artist whose seemingly simple melodies revealed great sophistication. Kline stepping through the movie with a dancers grace has perfect control here; suggesting secrets and pain with a raised eyebrow or a thin-lipped grin. And hes nicely matched by Ashley Judd who uses her knowing smile to good effect as Porters wife Linda a woman of such style that she sleeps in silk and pearls. Though ""De-Lovely"" is far more frank about Porters sexuality than the 1946 Porter film ""Night and Day"" it sometimes stumbles in the other direction (a gay bar in the film for example seems excessively art-directed full of gentlemen with disarmingly perfect bone structure). And Winkler and screenwriter Jay Cocks cant keep a certain melodramatic flavor from the proceedings particularly in the staging of Porters near-fatal riding accident -- but then again theyre dealing with a subject who had an undeniably melodramatic life. Visually ""De-Lovely"" is a treat; the costumes and colors are lavish and intricate with the movie occasionally fading elegantly into art deco black and white. And the songs warbled thinly by Kline (a trained singer whos toning down his talent to play the less mellifluous Porter) or sung by an all-star lineup of contemporary pop stars are given center stage as they deserve. Elvis Costello in a white tuxedo jacket bounces happily through ""Lets Misbehave""; lovely Vivian Green surely a star in the making delivers a spellbindingly bluesy ""Love for Sale."" Sheryl Crowe finds the shimmering tragedy at the heart of ""Begin the Beguine"" though her delivery is a tad mushy for my taste. (Perhaps she didnt hear Klines instructions in the film to the cast of ""Kiss Me Kate"" ""Keep those consonants crisp"") By the end as an unabashedly theatrical light fades on the aged Porter and we hear the reedy tones of the real Porter singing that delicious ode to friendship ""Youre the Top"" ""De-Lovely"" has found its voice. You just might leave the theater humming -- and these days thats pleasure enough.

Directed byIrwin Winkler. (PG-13. 121 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Decades before Aamp;E celebrity biographies were a staple of the movies. Under the breezy label biopic they freely inflated the lives of the rich and famous embellishing accomplishments and erasing blemishes. Cole Porter was still around for his soppy 1946 biopic ""Night and Day."" Theres an amusing scene in ""De-Lovely"" -- Hollywoods second stab at capturing the great songwriter onscreen -- where Porter played by the redoubtable Kevin Kline watches the finale from ""Night and Day."" Cary Grant the earlier incarnation of Porter struggles across a room in leg braces (his limbs had been crushed by a horse) into the arms of his loving wife Linda. ""If I can survive this movie I can survive anything"" Klines Porter tells his Linda (Ashley Judd). Porter also will survive ""De-Lovely"" a mishmash of a musical. The movie never gels -- despite Klines nuanced performance the stars exquisite period clothes designed by Armani and of course Porters great songs. Director Irwin Winklers highly stylized technique is difficult to connect with emotionally. His film also suffers from shockingly sloppy editing for a studio production. If nothing else the composer of ""I Get a Kick Out of You"" and ""Lets Do It Lets Fall in Love"" deserves a movie that has rhythm. But ""De- Lovely"" lurches along like a car with a missing spark plug. To the movies credit it explores Porters complicated marriage in which Linda tolerates her husbands homosexuality -- a verboten subject nearly 60 years ago when ""Night and Day"" was made. But by attempting to set the record straight ""De-Lovely"" overplays the great mans sexual escapades. Hes presented as putting more thought into his next lover than his next song. Porter at one point expresses a fear that his music will be seen through a prism of his sexual orientation. Knowing that he preferred young hunks gives new meaning to lyrics like ""Theres something wild about you child thats so contagious. Lets be outrageous lets misbehave."" If ""De-Lovely"" is so hell bent on getting the details of Porters life right why is Judd who is 20 years younger than Kline playing his wife when the real Linda was eight years older than Porter? Kline and Judd are at their best portraying the touching affection the Porters had for one another which was basically asexual (although the movie does reveal that the couple conceived a child together resulting in a traumatic miscarriage). They share a life as sophisticated as his lyrics. Linda buys her husband bejeweled cigarette cases to commemorate the openings of his musicals. She also stoically puts up with his infidelities. She knows Porter is gay when they marry but he looks pretty good compared to her abusive first husband. All Linda asks is that Porter be discreet. She leaves him when he cant resist showing off the pretty boy conquests he makes in Hollywood. But shes back at his bedside after his riding accident and stays with him until her death. Screenwriter Jay Cocks uses the cliche device of revealing a famous life in flashback. On his death bed Porter is visited by the angel Gabriel (Jonathan Pryce) who introduces himself as Gabe and guides the elderly songwriter to an empty theater to watch his past glories and misdeeds unfold onstage. Heavily made up and padded Kline looks distractedly like Robert Downey Jr. playing Charlie Chaplin at the end of his life. Hollywoods make-up artists appear to have the same limited palette of those sketch artists whose composites of suspected criminals all look alike. The exchanges between Cole and Gabe quickly become annoying breaking up the continuity of the story. When something bad is about to happen Porter moans that he doesnt want to watch. The stage setting helps overcome a basic problem of making musicals in these times when audiences have little patience with a character suddenly breaking into song. Alanis Morissette  Sheryl Crow Robbie Williams Diana Krall and Elvis Costello belt out Porters greatest hits with varying success. Krall hits just the right notes in ""Just One of Those Things."" But Crows offbeat interpretation of ""Begin the Beguine"" doesnt begin to do the song justice. Kline often is depicted at the piano (thats really him playing most of the time) trying out tunes. Porter didnt have much of a voice and Kline who has a far better one stays in character by limiting his range. Judd who rarely sings in public to avoid comparison to her mother and sister performs a passable ""True Love"" and ""In the Still of the Night."" ""De-Lovely"" wastes Pryce an amazing musical talent who originated the lead in ""Miss Saigon"" and was a brilliant Henry Higgins on the London stage by giving him only one number. His rendition of ""Blow Gabriel Blow"" doesnt come until the end and is interrupted mid-song. Paris and Venice where the Porters entertain and generally have a marvelous time have been recreated on a set in England and look it. The gondolas have the ersatz appearance of those at the Venetian in Las Vegas. Theyre as far from deluxe as this movie is from de-lovely. -- Advisory This film contains discreet scenes of homosexuality.

De-Lovely Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/de-lovely-2004,200,de-lovely14,de-lovely,rogerebert
"De-Lovely is (mostly) delightful - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW De-Lovely is (mostly) delightful By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  July 2 2004 ""This is one of those avant-garde things isnt it?"" gripes the old man as hes wheeled into the theater for a play rehearsal. Hes songwriter Cole Porter (Kevin Kline) and the character to whom he speaks is either a stage director named Gabe or Death himself. Since hes played by Jonathan Pryce bet on Death. The play that Porter and we are about to watch is his own life. With musical numbers. Sung by the likes of Elvis Costello and Sheryl Crow.It sounds like a hideous idea but ""De-Lovely"" turns out to be thoughtful creative and generally worthy of its subject with sins that are more of ambition and miscalculation than of execution. The movie a valentine to an older way of life and of music has a modern candor about homosexuality and that alone makes it an improvement over the last Porter biopic 1946s ""Night and Day"" in which Cary Grant fraudulently played the composer straight.And there are the songs airy delights with hidden pockets of melancholy. If nothing else ""De-Lovely"" is a refresher course in what made Porter one of the holy trinity of early 20th-century popcraft along with the Gershwins and Irving Berlin. Theres a marvelous scene in which the composer coaches an actor (John Barrowman) having trouble finding his way into the song ""Night and Day"" during a rehearsal for the 1932 musical ""Gay Divorce."" Porter breaks down the constituent parts of the tune and points out the thread of obsession that runs through them and what starts as a conversation between a composer and an actor becomes a dialogue between a composer and his own song.The actor he saves for bed. As directed by Irwin Winkler from a sometimes awkward sometimes sleek script by Jay Cocks the primary drama of ""De-Lovely"" concerns Porters 35-year marriage to Linda Thomas (Ashley Judd) a wealthy divorcee with whom he shared a strained intimacy that went beyond matters of sex. Or tried to -- the tension driving the couples scenes comes from whether such a swellegant ideal can work in the real world. The downside was that Cole increasingly dallied with the boys while Linda sat home alone. Judd playing right up against the limits of her talents keeps you sympathizing with the character even as you realize Linda may have been the 20th centurys most sophisticated doormat. This is a woman who with her last breath apologizes for dying.Does that make Cole a cad? Yes and no. In a performance thats pleasurably ripe yet lacking in actorly fussiness Kline plays Porter as a child of privilege who addresses self-knowledge in his songs and avoids it everywhere else. Hes a professional bon vivant as well as a professional songwriter -- I liked the shot of him working out the kinks of a tune with a thesaurus and a bottle of Johnnie Walker Red by his side -- and ""De-Lovely"" is fairly ruthless about the price one pays for such a life. But first it has to make Porters songs ""relevant"" to a new generation of moviegoers. To which I say God help us all. The production numbers in which ""real"" characters burst into song and dance feel forced -- Im of the opinion that MGM head Louis B. Mayer (Peter Polycarpou) probably never ham-and-egged it to the tune of ""Be a Clown"" -- and the star turns by Famous Performers of Today are mostly a wash.The problem is that singers such as Costello Robbie Williams and Alanis Morissette use a post-rock language of performance that bears no syntactical relationship to this time period or these songs. Either their vocal style is idiosyncratic and all wrong -- Elvis yawping through ""Lets Misbehave"" Alanis singing ""Lets Do It (Lets Fall in Love)"" through her nose -- or the physical gestures are off (Crows ""Begin the Beguine"" Diana Kralls ""Just One of Those Things""). Aside from Kline singing ""What Is This Thing Called Love?"" in Porters quavery whisper the only survivors are Vivian Green who gets the sense of ""Love for Sale"" if not the sadness and Natalie Cole who has been around long enough to know what to do with ""Evry Time We Say Goodbye.""That last song has an eerie appropriate line ""How strange the change from major to minor."" The final scenes of ""De-Lovely"" after Linda has passed away and Porter has suffered endless pain following a 1937 riding accident that crushed his legs are bitter indeed. They culminate in a remarkable sequence in which the aging composer tries to entertain dinner guests at his piano and instead becomes a kind of dying human jukebox with pieces of his songs pouring helplessly out of him bereft of sparkle and fooling no one.Its an awful distressing moment one that exposes the sweet lies behind an entire genre and Winkler cant handle it -- he changes gears into a final upbeat song-and-dance version of ""Blow Gabriel Blow."" But its too late to clear the bile out of your mouth and ironically that failure is a mark of the movies success. Fumbling as it can be ""De-Lovely"" catches the tragedy of the man who wrote ""Anything Goes"" and thought that it did.

"De-Lovely | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; de-lovely ) De-Lovely (United States/United Kingdom 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli As a bio-pic De-Lovely is pretty standard run-of-the-mill stuff (albeit with an interesting framing device). However as a ""best hits"" collection of Cole Porters music it is unparalleled. With approximately two-dozen of his tunes performed by artists as diverse as Robbie Williams Elvis Costello Alanis Morissette Sheryl Crow and Natalie Cole this is a treasure trove of music and memories. Its that rather than Irwin Winklers unremarkable presentation of Porters life which makes De-Lovely worth seeing. That and the de-lightful performance of Kevin Kline. The story opens with an aged Porter (Kline) accompanying a musical stage director (Jonathan Pryce) to a theater where he is about to watch a re-enactment of his life. Were never told whether this is a dream or an after-death experience but it doesnt much matter. Porter is taken on a literal trip down memory lane with special attention paid to the one true love of his life his wife Linda (Ashley Judd). Interestingly enough since Porter was gay his relationship with Linda was largely platonic - their sexual encounters were few and unsatisfying and they slept in separate bedrooms - but that did little to lessen the strength of their feelings for one another. She let him have as many male lovers as he needed and he devoted his daylight hours to her. The window into Coles past opens in 1919 Paris with the meeting between Cole and divorcee Linda. Soon they are married and Coles career as a songwriter is taking off. While in Venice he forms an important friendship with Irving Berlin (Keith Allen) and soon he has been requested to write a Broadway musical. So its off to New York for the Porters. After that the bright beacon of Hollywood beckons. Although Cole is initially reluctant to move to the West Coast he eventually yields to Lindas persuasion and becomes a workhorse for L.B. Mayer (Peter Polycarpou). While living in California Coles marriage begins to deteriorate and his promiscuity increases but when tragedy strikes Linda is again by his side. The story is an adequate framework for the songs and for Klines marvelous performance. The actor buries himself in the role making Porter come alive on the screen. Ashley Judd although capable doesnt radiate the same degree of charisma or energy (although she looks good in 20s costumes). Linda is an important part of the story to be sure but Judds work lacks the intensity of her co-stars. But this isnt really an actors film. As in many musicals the characters play second fiddle to the music. And in this case there are beginning-to-end recognizable tunes including ""Its De-Lovely"" ""Lets Misbehave"" ""Anything Goes"" ""Be a Clown"" ""I Love You"" and ""Evry Time You Say Goodbye."" At 125 minutes De-Lovely seems a little long and there are times when it moves slowly. On the whole however its an enjoyable experience with the level of enjoyment influenced by how much a viewer knows and enjoys Porters music. The love story is touching (and reminiscent of the Emma Thompson/Jonathan Pryce pairing in Carrington also about the deeper-than-physical connection between a woman and a homosexual man) but not out of the ordinary. Its at least strong enough to hold our interest until the next musical number comes along - which is never more than a few minutes away.

When I was 8 years old my mother took me to see the screen musical High Society a spirited frippery that confirmed my English-kids envious impression of America as a sunlit paradise where the natives sang danced and partied their brains out in shimmering frocks with de-luxe buttons. In retrospect this remake of The Philadelphia Story for which Porter wrote some of his best lyrics (""Well Did You Evah"") and his worst (""True Love"" still a bona fide guilty pleasure) might also be one exuberantly shallow way to look at the sort of life led by Porter in his prime a noted party animal who caroused his way around gay and straight Europe New York and Hollywood before a riding accident rendered him a pain-wracked invalid. If High Society offers a friskier portrait of Porters milieu than Michael Curtizs absurdly euphemistic 1946 biopic Night and Day with Cary Grant as Porter and Alexis Smith as his socialite wife Linda its also a lot more fun than Irwin Winklers new musical portrait a likable but plodding blend of strenuous style and canned psychology. Though hobbled by a contrived theatrical device that has a depressed and aging Porter (played in heavy makeup by Kevin Kline) trawling his life through his musical numbers De-Lovely offers some of the mild pleasures of a Jazz Age period piece among them the usual tuxedos and party dresses and some fancy replicas of the palaces and swank nightclubs in Paris Venice Manhattan and Los Angeles that Porter flitted through in his obsessive pursuit of a good time. More problematic are the musical numbers which might have benefited from a simple soundtrack featuring Ella Fitzgeralds superb interpretations a sweet revenge on the snobby Porter who never believed she could bring it off. Instead Winkler and his arranger Stephen Endelman fuss around with an array of contemporary music-world luminaries some of them divine (Vivian Green croons a sultry ""Love for Sale"" while Porter cruises a gay bar; Diana Krall gives a relaxed all too brief rendition of ""Just One of Those Things"") others jarringly miscast (Elvis Costello whom no one would ever accuse of being suave belts out ""Lets Misbehave"" while Sheryl Crow does an almost comically overwrought ""Begin the Beguine""). A producer of some discernment (Rocky and Raging Bull among many others) Winkler makes an earnest overly careful director. His 1991 blacklist drama Guilty By Suspicion was awful and the recent Life As a House was dreary at best. De-Lovely is neither but its attempts at high style are heavy-handed (Winkler doesnt skimp on Porters subterranean gay life but his approach is polite and gingerly as if hes holding his nose) and the movies reach exceeds its grasp when it aims for profundity. Porter was an imperfectly closeted homosexual promiscuous even by todays standards who nevertheless sustained a long and -- for one of them at least -- satisfying marriage to Linda Lee Thomas (played in the movie by Ashley Judd) a society beauty 15 years his senior who functioned variously as his muse his agent and his mom. For a man who penned some of the gayest (in every sense) lyrics ever written for American film and theater Porter according to his biographers had his dark moody not to say chilly and heedless side. Kline is a gifted song-and-dance man and the hint of Shakespearean pedantry that sometimes mars his acting serves him well in evoking the aloofness that lay behind Porters frivolity. But though he and Judd make a handsome couple -- her lovely flappers face willowy grace and low musical speaking voice seem made for the period -- theres no real sense of what lay behind this glamorous but from her point of view often cruelly unequal partnership. To their credit Winkler and his rather too declamatory screenwriter Jay Cocks dont try to write off the union as a marriage of convenience between a homosexual and his long-suffering beard. But Winkler never ventures any truly muscular speculation about the glue that held together the partnership between a man who gallantly stepped up to try for the baby his wife longed for yet kept her waiting night and day while he dallied with beautiful boys and a woman so devoted (or controlling) that she ended up as his procurer. If youre a Cole Porter fan you might like the songs in De-Lovely but as a portrait of an unusual marriage its de-lumbering de-liberate and de-cidedly flat.

As the result of a riding accident years before he has been denied the use of his legs and as he lurches down the aisle with a pair of crutches the audience delivers an ovation that is tinged with melancholy. Then the show begins and we hear a version of ""So in Love"" that sweeps and soars with gilded yearning. No longer just a love theme its the romantic testament of Cole Porter at the twilight of his creative life. The scene is conventional in its poignance yet as driven by the sweetness of the music it carries a lilting charge. Its tempting to describe ""De-Lovely"" as a standard Hollywood biography that happens to be graced with some of the most sublime popular songs ever composed. Except that the movie written by Jay Cocks and directed by Irwin Winkler creates a genuine alchemy We can accept this tidy cause-and-effect version of Porters life because the songs so fully express his spirit. Klines jauntiness has deepened with the years and he makes Porter a playful sweet-and-sour sophisticate who marries Linda Lee (Ashley Judd) loves her until the end of his life and has no guilt about acting out his desires for men. Porter is haunted by his accident yet ""De-Lovely ""is something dishy and rare a biopic about a happy and even enchanted man.

Such an insouciant and enticing neologism so perfectly emblematic of Cole Porter the man who coined it. You enter a movie with that title prepared to be enchanted. You straggle out a couple of hours later lost in a fog of gloom. For this films makers grimly insist that the songwriters life was essentially a betrayal of his impeccably sophisticated art when they might have more profitably seen his work as a gallant triumph over the difficulties of a messy life. De-Lovely proceeds from a miscalculated device. A nameless shade (Jonathan Pryce) arrives to conduct the aged crippled Porter (Kevin Kline) out of this world into the next. Before they depart they naturally pause to contemplate Porters 73 years of existence. His homosexuality is not elided. His tense and enigmatic marriage to Linda Lee Thomas (Ashley Judd) is inconclusively examined. So is the riding accident that crushed both his legs and put him in constant searing pain and (this is not mentioned) led to drug addiction for the last quarter-century of his life. This is serious material and you cannot blame serious filmmakers -- the movie was written by Jay Cocks (formerly a TIME critic) and directed by Irwin Winkler producer of some of the best movies (Raging Bull The Right Stuff) of recent times -- for being seduced by it. But something goes terribly wrong in the execution. Kline suggests Porters intractable snootiness but none of his perpetually boyish elan. Judd mostly simpers. The Porters had it seems a marriage of inconvenience leavened in the movie by glam settings the irrelevant appearances of famous people and of course the tunes Porter is occasionally seen dashing off. The immortal love songs and list songs are rendered by such pop stars as Alanis Morissette Sheryl Crow and Robbie Williams. They are supposed to bring in the younger crowd for whom Porter is either antiquated or anonymous. But theres little they can do to lift the pall of joylessness that hangs over this film. Yet joy -- cheekily comic indefatigably romantic -- is what Cole Porter was all about whatever tests and traumas he endured. We need to see that unlikely triumph maybe especially at this moment. Watching him stumble glumly to his grave is not an entertaining -- or useful -- alternative.

In contemporary culture exploration of a champagne personality devoted to wit fine living and discretion seems a highly esoteric undertaking one for which the evident audience seems very small. ""De-Lovely"" is an ambitious erratic attempt to convey the emotional life of the brilliant Broadway composer Cole Porter in the form of an original musical biography. Structurally inspired by ""All That Jazz"" and indebted to the film of ""Chicago"" for its strategy of layering levels of reality in a musical context Irwin Winklers most elaborate directorial outing benefits greatly from Kevin Klines outstanding performance as the ultra-sophisticated songwriter whose resilient marriage anchored a complicated double life. But in contemporary culture this exploration of a champagne personality devoted to wit fine living and discretion seems a highly esoteric undertaking one for which the evident audience seems very small. MGM can only pin its hopes on the idea that interest in the music as performed by an eclectic array of modern singers will spark wider curiosity in the film itself. Creator of such Broadway hits as ""Gay Divorcee"" ""Anything Goes"" ""Kiss Me Kate"" and ""Can-Can"" and a raft of hit songs from the late 20s through early 50s the Indiana-born Porter lived a glittering life in Paris New York and Hollywood populated by many other top celebrities of the era. His storys drama stems from his private gay life -- conducted while sharing a rewarding marriage to socialite wife Linda -- as well as from severe injuries that handicapped him for the last 27 years of his life. Winkler and screenwriter Jay Cocks take a chronological approach to their subjects life but not to his musical compositions dropping numbers into the narrative when they reflect the mood. They also frame events with comments from Porter himself; as an old man the composer is seated in a small theater watching a legit rendition of his life as mounted by a director named Gabe (Jonathan Pryce) with events onstage morphing into full-blown film interludes before cutting back to the pair discussing what theyve just seen or whats to come. Key to ushering the audience into the sweep and spirit of Porters life is the first major ensemble number ""Well Did You Evah"" which the elegant expat uses to jump-start a posh party in 20s Paris. Deliberately downplaying his previously proven vocal talents to more closely approximate Porters own just adequate singing voice Kline puts this tune and others over in a properly fun spirit even if the transitions and staging are variable in effectiveness. Penning droll lyrics as easily as he dispenses bon mots at soirees Porter finds a soul mate in beautiful American divorcee Linda Thomas (Ashley Judd) who finds in Porter the antithesis of her abusive first husband. What she also finds is a man whose sexual interests largely lie elsewhere. Asking only that he be discreet Linda accepts Porters liaisons with handsome young men in the confidence that these fleeting attachments wont threaten her deep bond with the man whose temperament status and money so perfectly complement her own. Unfortunately the couples social circle in Europe is presented without explanation. Their closest friends throughout their lives are shown to be Gerald and Sara Murphy (Kevin McNally and Sandra Nelson) with Monty Woolley (Allan Corduner) a close runner-up but pic offers the uninitiated no idea who they are or why theyre important. Other famous figures from Diaghilev to Louis B. Mayer and Irving Berlin surface from time to time with the last playing the key role of getting Porter to return to New York where in 1928 he had his first hit song ""Lets Do It Lets Fall in Love"" composed for the show ""Paris."" As the Porters lives sail along from one seemingly effortless success to another in an environment of untroubled splendidly attired luxury the lack of drama pushes the music centerstage. Unquestionably the songs represent the films raison detre and greatest attraction; there are 28 of them performed in different contexts and to varying effect depending upon the performer. Elvis Costellos ""Lets Misbehave"" is manic Diana Krall is an odd stylistic match on ""Just One of Those Things"" and ""I Get a Kick Out of You."" ""Night and Day"" is rather effectively used to establish a sexual connection between Porter and a new man (John Barrowman) and Alanis Morissette is rather wobbly on ""Lets Do It."" Arrangements are sometimes inventive and the chance to listen to these songs in a concentrated way underlines their exceptional tunesmanship and infinitely nimble ways of celebrating love. At pics hour-mark the party shifts to Hollywood where Porter has reluctantly succumbed to the lure of writing for the movies. With Linda already feeling alienated due to her husbands inattentivess Porter exacerbates matters by delving deeper into clandestine gay life. But the film is at its weakest on this turf as Winkler has no feel for the gay underworld of the time posing young men at pools and overly decorated private clubs as if for photo shoots; Todd Haynes in ""Far From Heaven"" did more in one little scene with Dennis Quaid to evoke the risky lure of the double life than does the whole of this film and it doesnt help that the recipients of Porters attentions are never developed beyond well-groomed cardboard pretty boys. Despite a somewhat stiff performance by Judd that consists too much of smiling support and reassurance the Porter marriage is more credible in that one can grasp what Cole and Linda were uniquely able to give one another. But while its clear where he goes for physical satisfaction her needs if she has them are never indicated. Naturally this was an issue never broached in the 1946 Warner Bros. Porter biopic ""Night and Day"" starring Cary Grant and Alexis Smith which in an amusing scene the couple watch here in a private screening. An unhappy increasingly unhealthy Linda finally leaves her husband for a while at which point he suffers a terrible horseback riding accident that nearly requires his legs to be amputated. Pondering this dreadful life turning point the elderly Porter tells Gabe he should just skip over this part in his play. But the decline cannot be ignored the countless operations increased reliance on painkillers and in 1954 Lindas death from cancer a period highlighted principally by Porters biggest hit the classic musical ""Kiss Me Kate."" He died in 1964. Keeping it all alive through all the dramatic ups and down and limited psychological and emotional complexity is Kline. Always the most dexterous and classy of actors and the winner of two Tony Awards for Broadway musicals he is an utterly credible man of the theater. Looking comfortable in black tie which he seems to wear half the time and with a drink frequently at hand Kline also supplely conveys a personality who could simultaneously be both present and not completely there for his wife or a friend but with his mind on something else such as a lyric or a man. Klines talent to amuse as Porters contemporary Noel Coward put it is consistent with that of the man hes playing. Klines aging over the course of about 40 years is marvelously etched by makeup designer Sarah Monzani with the actors voice progressing through equivalent changes. Costume designer Janty Yates production designer Eve Stewart and lenser Tony Pierce-Roberts have worked overtime to convey period elegance while music arranger Stephen Endelman brings some fresh approaches to the many famous tunes on the soundtrack for better and worse.
