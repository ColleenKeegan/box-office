Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr FREDDYS NOT DEAD Jackie Earle Haley is a dead-serious ghoul as the murderous Mr. Krueger in the new Nightmare on Elm Street (New Line Cinema) A Nightmare on Elm Street Genre Horror; Starring Jackie Earle Haley; Director Samuel Bayer; Author Eric Heisserer Wesley Strick; Release Date Wide 04/30/2010; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted April 30 2010 -- 1200 AM EDT I have over the years sat through more than my share of overly hyped all-slash-and-no-fun reboots of famous horror-film franchises. There was the new Jason the new Michael Myers and the new Leatherface -- all lackluster knockoffs of the originals (and yes Im including Rob Zombies Halloween in that litany of disappointments). The new relaunch of the Nightmare on Elm Street series though gave me good reason to be pumped. Its not every day that one of our rogues gallery of iconic psycho killers gets to be played by a creepy and fascinating actor -- in this case Jackie Earle Haley taking on the role of Freddy Krueger that burnt-to-a-crisp scarecrow of a madman. The new Freddy his singed skin more icky-realistic and less latexy than before has been molded to Haleys already scary features the sunken cheeks and pitted face the mouth that leers like an open wound. He wears the same red-and-green-striped sweater and glove with knived fingers but in other ways this Freddy is...well a little less of a cutup. In the sequels Robert Englunds Freddy evolved into more and more of a cackling vaudeville showman dispensing one-liners before every rip of his razor hand. But even in the first relatively restrained Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) there was an antic homicidal glee about him. In the new version hes more of a rotting glowering basically dead-serious ghoul. Haley knows how to make his own toxic sullenness show through the makeup and he gives Freddy a touch of gravitas. That works fine though I would have preferred to see Freddy turned into even more of an over-the-top funny wild-ass freak. Freddys backstory has been updated so that instead of just being a child killer hes now an accused pedophile (which was always the subtext anyway). The kids are the usual pretty and pretty vacant crew. As always to keep Freddy from murdering them in their dreams they have to stop themselves from going to sleep -- a gambit lifted from Invasion of the Body Snatchers and one that now if anything seems even more sociologically timely in the Red Bull-and-Ritalin era. The movie replays a number of infamous bits from the original Nightmare like Freddys glove popping out of the sudsy bathwater and his face stretching through the bedroom wall. Those moments still work. And there are a few bloody cool touches of psychedelic dreamscape imagery though not nearly as many as I would have expected from director Samuel Bayer who made the visionary video for Nirvanas ""Smells Like Teen Spirit."" I did jump a few times and I liked Haleys dour malevolence but overall the new Nightmare on Elm Street is a by-the-numbers bad dream that plays a little too much like a corporately ordered rerun. One two Freddys coming for you. Three four weve been there before. B?

Also in the remake are most of the familiar characters and scenes you may fondly recall from the campy 1984 Wes Craven classic starring Johnny Depp at his goofiest (as Glen) and Heather Langenkamp (Glens girlfriend Nancy). Music-video-trained director Samuel Bayers reboot is the same but decidedly different. His is more poetically Gothic and haunting less cheesy; more controlled and sophisticated less rambling and bizarre. The film opens on an ominous rainy night in a blood-hued diner that is deserted except for a lone teenage customer Dean and a waitress. He asks for more coffee. She rudely ignores him and disappears. He follows her into a kitchen on fire its flickering stove top illuminating the contents of various pots and pans gruesome animal heads. Then Dean hears the scissoring-steel sound of finger knives. Less excruciating than the nails-on-a-chalkboard screech of 80s Freddy Freddy 2010s slicing metal and nail scraping noise doesnt distract as much making it easier to focus on just how unsettling the burned madman in the red-striped sweater truly is. Watchmens Jackie Earle Haley plays a pitch-perfect Freddy with a gravely-voiced intensity that fits the film like a glove. Still as murderous as the original Haleys Freddy -- like the movie -- makes more sense. Theres something he wants his victims (Nancy Dean and the other Elm Street teens whose nightmares he haunts) to know. Though they all know if they die in these nightmares theyll never wake up. His crimes against children that sentenced him to a fiendish dream existence -- captured in Polaroid pictures we cant see hinted at with horrified gasps that arent explained -- seem to be too terrible to reveal. And theres another twist to his and the teens history not present in Cravens film. Beyond the big 80s hair mom jeans and sweater vests the high schoolers have also changed. Tina is now Chris Rod is Jesse and Quentin (rather than Glen) and Nancy (Youth in Revolts Rooney Mara) arent as together as they used to be. Theyre not an official couple though Quentin obviously pines for Nancy. Like the movie theyre also moodier more serious and more damaged than the dorky air-headed youths of 1984. Clad in Emo attire Quentin (Kyle Gallner) is a more cherubic Edward the vampire (i.e. Twilights Robert Pattinson). Nancy as she admits doesnt fit in and spends her time scribbling disturbing sketches. Bayer also maintains and amps up the eeriness in Nightmare on Elm Streets atmospheric signatures like jump-roping children chanting Freddys chilling nursery rhyme (""one two Freddys coming for you...""). And despite the somber tinge hes added to the story hes also kept Freddys taunting ""Im your boyfriend now Nancy"" wit (but not the phone tongue) plus some of the original films body bag humor. In addition Bayers included some 21st-century updates that bring more realism and rawness to the horror tale. Quentin GigaBlasts (Giga-whaa?) sleep deprivation on the web and discovers the danger of micronaps. (Was Google over-budget?) Instead of coffee the kids stay awake with speed drugs and stolen adrenaline shots. Fans of Cravens nightmare may complain that its not the same maniacal fun-house ride. Nor is it a bold reinvention. Still its artfully executed particularly by special effects creators and Haley. All in all Nightmare on Elm Street 2010 still thrills (and is a little fun) especially for younger generations taking their first trip to Elm Street.

Michael Bay one of the producers and a genius at crass knew in his cynical soul that a few more bucks could be squeezed out of Freddy Krueger -- the deadly dream-stalker of the scissorhands fedora striped sweater and jones for preying on tender young flesh. The movies one inspired idea was casting Jackie Earle Haley as the character created by Robert Englund. Haley a child actor who launched an Oscar-nominated comeback as a pedophile in 2006s Little Children rips into the role with relish. Its too bad the script turns him into a deadpan joke machine.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> It took two or three films for the first franchise to devolve into silliness. Cravens first film kept Freddy creepily in the shadows not cracking wise. Many remember the first Elm Street as the debut of Johnny Depp playing one of Freddys young victims. Kyle Gallner Thomas Dekker and Rooney Mara better get better jobs on their resumes pronto if they hope to register on a Depp level. All thats required of them here is to look pretty while theyre slaughtered. The new Elm Street marks the feature-directing debut of music video whiz Samuel Bayer (Nirvanas ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" Green Days ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams""). But its the Bay touch you feel in the way actors register as body count characters go undeveloped and sensation trumps feeling. A nightmare indeed.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 30 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Apr. 30 2010 235AM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English A Nightmare on Elm Street Directed by Samuel Bayer Written by Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer Starring Jackie Earle Haley Rooney Mara and Kyle Gallner Classification 18A The new ""reinvention"" of A Nightmare on Elm Street the ninth film in the horror franchise is the latest in a series of remakes ( Texas Chainsaw Massacre Friday the 13th and Halloween) all under the auspices of Transformer director Michael Bays production company. The current film is directed by Samuel Bayer (known for music videos and commercials) who has promised to correct the drift of the series toward a campy formula of gruesome murders and wisecracks and get Nightmare back on a scary footing. According to filmmaker Wes Craven his inspiration for the original 1984 movie A Nightmare in Elm Street came from news stories about Cambodian refugees who were terrified by nightmares and sometimes died in their sleep. Theres a slim basis of fact here - the phenomenon of ""sudden unexplained death syndrome"" among southeast Asian males first documented in the 1970s appears to be a cardiac issue unrelated to bad dreams - but it was a seductive concept for a film about night terrors. The series premise always allowed for sudden transitions between two worlds banal teen life in suburban Ohio and the surreal violent dreamscapes of its inhabitants sleep. As well Nightmare is the series that launched the very pretty Johnny Depp in his career and made the very ugly Freddie Krueger the knife-fingered man with the burned face fedora hat and red and green Christmas sweater into a pop-culture figure known well beyond the movies audience. The result of the new Nightmare is at best a kind of stand-off between predictability and competent execution. The film is better than the other recent horror series. Bayer along with writers Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer has reshaped the back story while borrowing liberally from Cravens best scenes (the girl thrown against the ceiling in her dreams images of creepy kids playing skip rope). Theres also a bit of The Blair Witch Project here in a child-abuse subplot (the film is otherwise carefully non-sexual) and barrels of the crimson stuff flowing around the sets. There is not though much here to freeze the heart or fire the imagination in a film that is pedestrian in its direction all medium shots and jump cuts like any number of scary television series. As in the original movie our heroine is named Nancy (Rooney Mara) one of a group of teenagers who discover they are sharing a consistent dream about the ominous knife-fingered Freddie who when not threatening them seems to be leading them to an old elementary school where he has a secret. After three teenagers die in their sleep the last two surviving dreamers Nancy and her would-be boyfriend Quentin (Kyle Gallner) decide to get pro-active. Nancys mother (Connie Britton) is obviously hiding secrets from the past and together Nancy and Quentin go on a sleuth hunt through the town trying to uncover the dirty secret that might explain the origins of Freddie and his vengeful spirit. Both Mara fine-featured and earnest and the puppy-eyed Gallner are well-cast. Theyre the kind of emo kids who if not exactly outsiders are more introverted and sensitive than their peers. The other major innovation here the subject of much Internet buzz is that theres a new Freddie as veteran Robert Englund is replaced by Jackie Earle Haley. Haley was a 1970s teen actor ( Bad News Bears Breaking Away) who made a comeback as a child molester in Little Children (2006) and went on to star in last years Watchmen. Hes a gifted actor with a flare for creepiness. In keeping with the new story he emphasizes Freddies anger more than his macabre playfulness. The moment when he growls ""Im r-r-r-real"" produces a nice shiver but opportunities for emotional nuance - under the mask of scabby make-up and with distorted vocals - are limited. In a few flashbacks we see Haley playing plain old Fred Krueger a boyish school janitor in his more carefree if not more innocent days. If theres one lesson to be learned from his example its that years of shift work can be a nightmare for your complexion.

The franchises success was based on that most elemental of fears. Were afraid of the dark because were afraid of the repressed and the mystery that sleep brings a mystery that might as well have long knives for fingernails.Now after 26 years and umpteen sequels the Hollywood assembly line deemed it wise and profitable to hit the restart button. Robert Englund has become Jackie Earle Haley. The teen insomniacs funneled through the age of Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer are a little more glamorous (remember Johnny Depp wasnt yet Johnny Depp when he starred in the original). The finished product while hardly a nightmare gives off a strong ""why bother"" scent. Movie Information A Nightmare on Elm StreetRatingShowtimes | Official siteDirector Samuel BayerActors Jackie Earle Haley Kyle Gallner Rooney Mara Katie Cassidy and Thomas DekkerRun time 95 minutesMPAA rating R (strong violence language)Synopsis Jackie Earle Ray puts on the Freddy Krueger finger knives for this remake.More movies from GuideLive.comChances are you know the basics. A group of teen friends has been having the same kind of nightmare in which the sweater guy saunters in and scrapes his knife nails. It seems Monsieur Krueger has the power to eviscerate you in your dreams which makes falling asleep a risky proposition. To die to sleep; to sleep perchance to dream. Or as the rapper Nas put it ""I never sleep cause sleep is the cousin of death.""The dream sequences arent particularly special though theyre usually good and bloody. The surprise factor is almost nil especially if youve been in any proximity to the original franchise. The jump scares given a little extra oomph by the ever-looming possibility of a double wake-up do what theyre supposed to do. They make you jump.So lets talk about the new Freddie. Haley has had a fascinating career trajectory from Bad News Bears to oblivion to acclaimed character actor (hes both heartbreaking and abominable in Little Children). Hes a little more lithe than Englund a little huskier in voice. If you were ever a 14-year-old kid with a Freddie Krueger poster on your wall though theres really only one. Hes like your first love if your first love hunted kids in their dreams and rocked a funky striped sweater.We would advise you to accept no substitute - except in this day and age substitutes seem to be the cutting edge. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Starring Jackie Earle Haley Rooney Mara Kyle Gallner Katie Cassidy Rooney Mara Thomas Dekker Kellan Lutz Clancy Brown Connie Britton Lia D. Mortensen Director Samuel Bayer Release Opened Apr 30 2010  Editorial Review Latest Nightmare fails to deliver the chills -- and fun -- of the originalBy Jen ChaneyThursday April 29 2010Freddy Krueger used to be such a fun guy.Sure he wore a ratty sweater had a complexion like a blister-covered relief map repeatedly invaded peoples dreams then shoved his deadly finger knives into their torsos. But he had such a sense of humor about the whole thing.Unfortunately in the remake of 1984s ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" -- dont call this a reimagining people because imagination is the last thing at work here -- good ol Fred loses any sense of playful shock he once possessed and turns into a generic figure meticulously manufactured to simultaneously gross and freak us out. It doesnt work.Jackie Earle Haley -- who earned a well-deserved Oscar nomination for his role as a sex offender in 2006s ""Little Children"" -- assumes the Freddy persona made iconic in eight previous ""Nightmare"" movies by as this movie makes abundantly clear the irreplaceable Robert Englund. The basic storyline remains the same A bunch of teens in a cozy suburb called Springwood start having simultaneous bad dreams about the same homicidal dude dreams in which some of them are viciously murdered and wind up dead in real life.Screenwriters Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer take a couple of liberties with the original backstory. In the 84 version Krueger was a child murderer burned by a mob of angry Springwood parents after being freed from prison; this time hes a suspected pedophile set ablaze by a mob of angry Springwood parents after taking innocent children to his dank basement home underneath their preschool. Because you know most accredited preschools are totally cool about letting weird guys reside in their basements.The flick spends most of its time re-slashing its way through scenes already familiar to anyone who saw Wes Cravens original while adding enough ""modern"" tweaks to make this ""Nightmare"" relevant to younger audiences. Remember that scene from the first ""Elm Street"" when a terrifying silhouette of Freddy nearly bursts through the wall above our heroine Nancys bed? Well in the 2010 version we see that same scene -- only this time Nancy is listening to her iPod.As for Haley he pours every bit of menace he can muster into Krueger but cant overcome the listless direction by Samuel Bayer or the completely unterrifying updated Krueger makeup job foisted onto his face. When Englund wore the pock-marked ghoulish guise he seemed genuinely creepy even while he was cracking absurd jokes. But the ""new"" Krueger looks like some melted-candle hybrid of the Pale Man from ""Pans Labyrinth"" and Hans Moleman from ""The Simpsons.""Even when he rips off a halfway-decent one-liner -- ""Hows this for a wet dream?"" he barks at Nancy (played with zero intensity by Rooney Mara) as she slogs down a liquefied hallway in yet another scene ripped straight from the first ""Street"" -- all we can think of is how much we miss the Robert Englund Freddy. Man that guy knew how to have a killer good time. Contains strong and bloody horror violence disturbing images terror and language.

Photo (c)Warner Bros/courtesy Everett Co Truly grotesque stuff is all around us -- car wrecks aviation disasters LiLos Twitter feed -- but the reboot of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" wont cost you any sleep. As always Freddy Krueger (Jackie Earle Haley who has made a specialty out of playing pervs and masked men -- this time he does both) claws his way into the hearts (and lungs and intestines) of dreaming high-schoolers. While they fight to stay awake instead of fighting back first-time director Samuel Bayer fights to be as obvious as possible and from this battle he emerges in triumph. There are the usual loud sound-blasts to go with false alarms the usual fantasy-reality switcheroos (as when for instance a character lies awake in bed but it turns out is really dreaming about being awake). Even when things are wrapped up tidily the audience happily stays put for the One Final Shock everyone knows is coming (regardless of whether it makes sense). PHOTOS NOTABLE HORROR FILM REMAKES This time the kids drift off for brief ""micronaps"" which are an excuse to have Freddy pop in for a second or two and theres a reference to the real-life trumped-up child-abuse cases which were a far scarier aspect of the 1980s than Mr. Krueger ever was. To the audience suckered into paying to see this heres why your generation sucks. A book for first-graders by Carl Reiner was called ""Tell Me a Scary Story But Not Too Scary."" Young adults going to this movie are mentally first-graders with a higher tolerance for gore. Going in you know the story and pretty much whats going to happen in every scene (Freddy is going to pop up in varying settings). A girl gets in the bathtub and everyone waits for the finger-knives to appear so they can issue a properly prepared-for shriek. Thats pretend scared. Now that there have been eight Freddy movies 12 Jasons and 10 Halloweens it might be time to declare that kids like to see the same stuff over and over. (When Generation X sat through all this at least it was new or new-ish.) But just as you cant tickle yourself you cant really be scared unless you honestly dont know whats next. Teens are so uncertain all the time that they crave movies where everything is as pre-arranged as soccer practice. When you start to notice that full-on predictability has become unpleasant to watch you might just have arrived at the moment of your moviegoing maturity. Though Freddy is basically the same guy as in the 1984 original his back story is different. For a few minutes the movie threatens to become interesting -- then retreats. (Mild spoilers follow.) Much like his fan Groundskeeper Willie from ""The Simpsons"" Freddy actually worked at a school and was beloved by the 5-year-olds. But those kids may have been coached by hysterical parents to give false child-abuse testimony against Freddy that resulted in his lynching. The plot point echoes several 1980s witch hunts such as the Amirault case in which three preschool staffers were jailed based solely on testimony given by children. Later it emerged the kids had been coached to lie about the abuse. In the movie the teens come to believe Freddy is punishing them to get back at the parents who may have cajoled them into giving false testimony as pre-schoolers. By the end though any feel for gray areas in guilt and punishment (does a molester really deserve to be burned alive?) is dropped. And even the big plot question that ought to be the heart of the movie -- how do you go about tricking and killing a boogeyman? -- rushes by in an instant instead of being a mystery the students solve step by step. That Freddy appeared only for a few minutes in the original was an asset in suspense terms (see also the shark in ""Jaws"") but this time hes everywhere -- and he wont shut up. ""Your mouth says no but your body says yes"" he says and ""Now its time to play"" and ""Now let me take a stab"" If Id been feeling deprived of lame one-liners I would have stayed home and watched Bill Maher. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next In My Sleep Read Next In My Sleep Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 63425 How Hillary blew her big moment 31103 Malia Obama skipped the DNC for Lollapalooza 21143 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary Jill and Joe Biden stop traffic on Fifth Avenue Ex-Focus Features CEO thanks company for firing him SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Media San Francisco Chronicle A Nightmare on Elm Street Horror. Starring Jackie Earle Haley Kyle Gallner and Rooney Mara. Directed by Samuel Bayer. (R. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" - the series as a whole but also the brand-new movie of the same title - is based on half of a brilliant idea. The brilliant part is that an evil man comes to people in their dreams and whatever horrible thing he does to them also happens in reality. So if theyre killed in a dream they never wake up theyre dead theyve bought the farm goodbye. Now this is a brilliant (half) idea first because its fun. Second because it opens up all kinds of visual possibilities. And third because this is something that everybody can understand. Everybody has had dreams in which they cant move and feel as if theyre being sucked into hell. At least I hope everybody has had that dream. But this is only half an idea because theres a narrative component missing. When you hear this half idea you want to know ""What happens?"" That is how does this concept translate into a story? But over multiple sequels and variations no one has ever been able to come up with something that might result in a respectable plot. Instead its the same thing over and over People have dreams and either get their guts ripped out or dont get their gets ripped out. And then after 90 or so minutes are used up the movie finds some weak pretext for ending.

(Warner Bros/MCT) Photo Handout MCT Review A Nightmare on Elm Street 1 / 5 Back to Gallery But of course there can be no ending and not only because the producers want to keep making sequels. There can be no ending because no one has come up with the second half of this brilliant idea. And by now - many many millions of dollars later - no one has any incentive to come up with it. A good idea might screw up a winning formula. So any ""Nightmare"" movie has a built-in handicap going in but the better ones find ways to compensate by casting appealing young actors (theyre always young) by having imaginative dream sequences and - most important of all - by keeping the dreams short. By that standard this new ""Nightmare"" is a fairly decent effort. This movie restarts the series this time with Freddy Krueger played by Jackie Earle Haley who is almost creepy-looking enough to do the role without makeup. I mean this in the nicest way. We begin with a dramatic Freddy-induced death and soon we learn that Freddy has been appearing lately in the dreams of a number of young students. He plans to kill them all You know the rest. If you have seen one of these movies you absolutely positively know the rest. (If you havent seen one of these movies its because you just dont want to and I commend your taste and discernment.) But something is worth saying about the young actors in this cast Theyre excellent. Far be it from me to bemoan the state of American cinema when Hollywood keeps providing talented young people the opportunity to have their guts ripped out in a slasher movie. Johnny Depps first screen credit was in the first ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" (1984). With that in mind lets hope that Rooney Mara (Nancy) Katie Cassidy (Kris) and Kyle Gallner (Quentin) have the same luck and find the same opportunities to show what they can do - that is what they can really do besides scream. -- Advisory Oh the blood the blood everywhere.

And finds Freddy Krueger (Jackie Earle Haley) the razor-fingered dream stalker. Back in his booth Dean seems to be struggling with himself then takes a knife and slits his own throat deep and deadly. The title card A Nightmare on Elm Street snaps onto the screen and the audience at last nights Times Square press screening erupts in a gleeful cheer. (See the TIME 100 our list of the worlds most influential people.) Or maybe that was from the Dolby because much of the postscreening chatter -- at least what I overheard the New York bloggerati say about this remake of the 1984 Wes Craven half-classic -- was enthusiastic only in its contempt. Theyd behaved themselves during the screening but on the street afterward they could have been Tea Partiers at an Obama Is a Commie rally. ""How can you not do the face-suck?"" one of the Cravenists asked with a rhetorical sneer. ""Did they think they were remaking West Side Story?"" another contumelied. Their tone of dismissal echoed this morning throughout the geekosphere. I liked the new Nightmare but I know that any new version of a revered text -- a favorite old book play or movie -- invites invidious comparison. In this case your fondness for the remake may be in inverse proportion not just to the extent of your admiration for the Craven original but also to how recently you saw it. I last watched Heather Lagencamp battle Robert Englunds Freddy (with baby-faced Johnny Depp an early victim) about a decade ago. It was fine and it had the advantage of being the first. (See pictures of 80s remakes.) The new one directed by vide-auteur Samuel Bayer and written by Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer is what Id call a fine copy. Yes it offers a higher frequency of Freddy interventions. And its as scrupulous as Kick-Ass in applying todays technology to the old story a boy video-blogs his Freddy fears before his head is smashed into the screen; as an exhausted girl works at her PC it flashes ""Computer entering sleep mode."" But this is not a ""reimagining"" -- that would be what David Cronenberg did in his 1986 masterpiece The Fly based on the so-so 1959 film. The new Nightmare is a straight shiny honorable remake. (Read TIMEs 1988 story on the Nightmare franchise.) Bayer replays dozens of the elements Craven established. (If you are one of the few people who never saw the first Nightmare you should probably STOP READING NOW.) Of course this film retains the notion of a fiend from the past who torments a group of small-town teens as they sleep. But also the Psycho strategy of investing the audiences interest in one character only to kill her off and switch focus to another woman; the frisson of Freddys form seeming to lean out of a girls bedroom wallpaper; his possession of the girls body that summons the levitating powers of Linda Blair in The Exorcist and Fred Astaires dancing on walls and ceilings in Royal Wedding; the visitations of dead schoolkids; one girls burning her arm to say awake; and the final grim twist -- a parent finally feels Freddys wrath. Bayer who directed such music videos as Nirvanas ""Smells like Teen Spirit"" brings a craftsmans loving attention to every aspect of the movie from the opening credits (which appear in a childs script like an S.O.S. jotted desperately on a sidewalk and where the sign ""Badham Pre-School"" turns into ""Bad School"") to flicked references to old scare movies like Cronenbergs Shivers (a somnolent teen in a bathtub her legs asprawl with Freddys claw rising briefly teasingly). Bayer isnt Orson Welles exactly but he has plenty of assurance and the props to back it up. I also enjoyed watching the young cast even when they had to enact horror-film tropes like the guy who leaves his girl alone near the climax. The five actors in the teen leads might look a little mature for 18-year-olds (they range from 22 to 25) but the characters have surely been aged and withered by their psychic torment and they have the dead-seriousness of U.S. soldiers on their fifth and perhaps terminal tour of Iraq. Serious is also the word for Haley -- unlike Englund who devolved in the five or six sequels into a campy lounge act. Hes pure predation and hes responsible for the films definitive blecccchhh moment when he approaches Nancy (Rooney Mara) whose back he had scarred when she was in preschool and growls ""Youre my little Nancy"" then licks her face. (Read a Qamp;A with the actor playing Freddy Krueger.) Bayer also conducts a bit more cunningly than Craven did a symphony of cinematic sadism on the viewers nerves. Most horror films have downtime between the gross-out scenes space for audiences to grab their wits and prepare for the next shock. Often a movie lets you know when to relax. With The Exorcist for example we soon learned that we were safe as long as the camera stayed out of poor Regans room. Sea-monster movies like Jaws taught us we were safe if we stayed out of the water (except for last years craptacular Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus in which a really great white leaps from the water to attack and devour a 747 cruising at 30000 ft.). Nightmare at first seems to offer periods of downtime since were led to believe that a kid is in jeopardy only when she or he falls asleep. Ah but whose nightmare is it anyway? Whose frantic brain are we inside? After some adjustments we figure it out and realize with a shiver that Freddys in there too the weirdo in the red-and-green striped sweater and the burn-victim scowl. Hed be among the creepiest villains ever -- if it werent for the kids parents. The adults youll recall are the ones who 15 years earlier turned Freddy from an eccentric preschool janitor a toxic influence on the children he doted on to the maleficent undead creature who haunts their sleep. (The new movie has a more sensible explanation of Freddys crime -- well just say it coincides with the crime Haleys character was convicted of committing in his Oscar-nominated role in Little Children a few years back.) Now teenagers the children still dont know what happened so when Freddy comes back to play inside their skulls they are both terrified and baffled. The storys sociopolitical message is blunt and potent. Your parents it says are sedaters trying to control you with their silence evasion and lies. These guardians of the official adult culture the soothing fraudulent status quo want you to be ignorant of both the man who can harm you and the knowledge that might save you. When the kids beg for help the grownups advise them to ""try and get some sleep."" Only Freddy tells them the truth -- ""You really shouldnt fall asleep"" -- just before he slaughters them. But since Freddy is also the ultimate horror image of an abusive father figure the plot of the original Nightmare and this borderline-gripping remake plays like a emergency session in psychoanalysis. Interpret your dreams come to grips with the past confront your demons and you shall be free. Unless audiences make the movie a hit and a sequel appears in a year or so -- and the whole cycle of torture and revenge recommences like a dreadful dream from which you cant awake.

"A Nightmare on Elm Street Slash-by-numbers game | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesA Nightmare on Elm Street Slash-by-numbers gameThere are reasons for murder in this remake of the 1984 horror franchise original but theres no good reason for the film to live.The same bathtub scene from the 1984 original A Nightmare on Elm Street shows up in the 2010 remake.  (SUPPLIEDPHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. April 29 2010A Nightmare on Elm Street (out of 4)Starring Jackie Earle Haley Rooney Mara and Kyle Gallner. Directed by Samuel Bayer. 95 minutes. At major theatres. 18AThere are a lot of things wrong with this remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street not least of which is that it was made at all. Greed not art inspired the reboot of this still-potent 1980s horror franchise.My chief complaint however is the completely boneheaded decision to give dream-stalking killer Freddy Krueger a back story that splains why hes so bad. The 1984 original made a brief and spooky reference to his earthly pursuit as a child murder before angry parents roasted him and consigned him to nightmare hell.Article Continued BelowEssentially though Freddy kills because he enjoys killing -- does all that cackling indicate anything less than pure evil pleasure? He doesnt need a reason to wield his glove of blades against soft teen flesh just as the Joker in The Dark Knight didnt require a permit to set Gotham City ablaze ""You know what I am?"" he tells Batman. ""Im a dog chasing cars.""Its the random nihilism of their deeds that makes guys like the Joker and Freddy Krueger so terrifying something that the original Freddy Robert Englund instinctively understood. Real terror lies in the fear of the unknown.New recruit Jackie Earle Haley awkwardly fitting into Freddys filthy red-and-green sweater floppy hat and scissor hands obviously doesnt get it. But then neither do director Samuel Bayer a videographer-turned-filmmaker and screenwriters Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer.This new version of Freddy is like a bad actor running around and screaming ""Whats my motivation?"" There is plenty of motive provided in the remakes tedious addition to the original story which turns into a Nancy Drew episode as teen Freddy fighters visit a schoolhouse crime scene to sleuth the killers pedophiliac past.Whats missing are the scary bits. This is slash-by-numbers Freddy where the murders of the original film shocking by 1984 standards are dutifully and tediously reenacted with a new group of teen victims played by the 20something Rooney Mara Katie Cassidy Thomas Dekker Kyle Gallner and Kellan Lutz. (Will one of them be famous a quarter century from now like Johnny Depp from the original cast?)Even the famous blades-through-the-legs bathtub moment is revisited. You could almost call it homage to Nightmare creator Wes Craven except Craven isnt pleased that he was slashed out of this remake.Haley could only wish that hed been passed over too. He was far more frightening playing that other disfigured psycho the masked vigilant Rorschach in last years Watchmen.The real puzzle about this still-born Nightmare is its relative restraint. The original film made in the pre-digital age pushed the envelope of technology and good taste with its gory murder scenes.This new Nightmare could have used CGI to considerably up the films gore quotient. But then that would push it into a harder rating than the ""R"" the movie has stateside (its 18A in Ontario) and reduce ticket sales. And making money of course is the only thing that makes sense about this frightful remake.

"Nightmare on Elm Street A | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; nightmare-on-elm-street-a_2077 ) Nightmare on Elm Street A (United States 2010) April 29 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli With remakes available for both Halloween and Friday the 13th it was only a matter of time before the third member of the trio of 80s horror icons was provided with a new opportunity to greet a new generation. Welcome to 2010 Freddy Krueger. You were scarier in 1984. In many ways Wes Cravens original movie was innovative. It arrived in theaters when the slasher era was peaking and postulated that a gory movie could also be rich in ideas and misdirection. A Nightmare on Elm Street toyed with the lines between reality and fantasy in ways that no previous motion picture had done. Many of the things Craven accomplished in that production have been copied so often they now feel like clichA(c)s but they were fresh in 1984 and that freshness imparted energy to the movie. The energy is missing in the remake because the techniques which are replicated in a straightforward fashion are stale. For 2010s A Nightmare on Elm Street to emerge from its inspirations shadow he filmmakers needed to discover a new way to enliven this chapter in the Freddy Kreuger saga and they didnt. Like Rob Zombies Halloween this version of A Nightmare on Elm Street is part prequel part remake. Using altered bits and pieces of Freddy Kruegers back story as shown in the 1984 film and its sequels screenwriters Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer provide a half-assed origin for the villain which absorbs an inordinate amount of screen time. Freddy like most horror icons is more interesting the less one knows about his background so by starting things out with his case history he is inherently less terrifying. Random seemingly unmotivated violence is more unnerving than something with a ""rationale"" (no matter how twisted) behind it. A Nightmare on Elm Street 2010 has been assembled much as a ""best of"" collage of moments not only from the original but from other horror movies. Classic images from Cravens edition appear the little girls jumping rope the claw breaking the surface of the bathtub waterline and the acrobatic bedroom slaughter. But theres also at least one moment lifted from Halloween and a few allusions to the Nightmare sequels. The storyline isnt a strict replication of its predecessors narrative but it follows a similar trajectory. The central characters are a group of five high school teens Nancy (Rooney Mara) Quentin (Kyle Gallner) Jess (Thomas Dekker) Kris (Katie Cassidy) and Dean (Kellan Lutz). All are experiencing nightmares featuring a scarred burned man (Jackie Earle Haley) wearing a striped shirt wide-brimmed hat and a glove equipped with razor-sharp nails. He likes to use those cutting accessories like utensils on his victims and when someone dies in their dreams which is where Freddy Krueger exists and preys they die in real life. One-by-one the kids are eliminated until the only two remaining are the sleep-deprived Nancy and Quentin who use stimulants to stay awake but cant keep the narcoleptic moments at bay. For them its a race against time to uncover the truth behind Freddy and find a way to stop him before sleep overtakes them for good. Director Samuel Bayer a man with an impressive music video resume who was personally recruited by producer Michael Bay spends considerably more time refining the look of the film than developing the characters or helping the actors bring them to life in a convincing fashion. Nothing hurts horror more than lifeless performances and A Nightmare on Elm Street is full of those. Maybe theres another Johnny Depp to be found in this group of performers (Depp it should be noted was unimpressive in the original) but it seems unlikely. It might even be a stretch to say there are five Heather Langenkamps. There are no cameos which is both a surprise and a disappointment. Im trying to remember when it became ""uncool"" to have members of an original cast make bit appearances in a re-make. At one point this sort of thing was almost a requirement; lately it rarely happens. Its somewhat mystifying that Robert Englund one of the few original A Nightmare on Elm Street participants willing to go on record as supporting the remake (Craven for example has voiced his opposition) doesnt appear in a single frame of the finished production. There are plenty of opportunities for cameos but apparently no one thought of it or worked hard enough to make it happen. When it comes to set design and atmosphere the film is on stable ground but many of the locales (both in the real world and the dreamscapes) seem cloned from those in other horror movies. Originality is at a premium. A major conceit of the 1984 version that Nancy is a typical girl in a normal community (doesnt nearly every town have an ""Elm Street""?) is removed. Theres nothing stable or conventional about Nancy or her friends. The dreams start before the first frame of the movie and the participants are strung out by the time the first murder heralds the title card. Its a way to open with a flair but is not an effective manner to develop identifiable characters. Its easy to forget that the original A Nightmare on Elm Street was more about Nancy than Freddy. He was the demon in the background - an implacable force of evil that motivated events without being at their center. Understandably because Freddy became such a recognizable figure during the 80s and into the 90s he is given a more prominent role here. Unfortunately the greater exposure diminishes him. One thing that distinguished Freddy from Jason and Michael was his personality. He was a vicious sadist with a ready barrage of one-liners. The sequels gradually changed the character into a parody of his early self but in his original incarnation (and the one re-imagined by Craven in 1994s A New Nightmare) Freddy was chilling. Here he is distressingly bland. His limited arsenal of one-liners is delivered with less relish than one might expect. And the make-up is unimpressive. The layers of latex applied to Robert Englund turned the mild-featured man into a frightening monster. Jackie Earle Haley appears vaguely reptilian like an old guy with a bad skin condition. He looks like the ""classic"" Freddy in silhouette but the illusion disappears in close-up. The producers argue that the new-look makeup was designed to make Freddy more closely resemble a ""real"" burn victim but since when did ""reality"" become important in a movie that deals so forcefully in dreams? A Nightmare on Elm Street makes the remake authors of the late-70s/80s horror staples a perfect zero-for-three. Halloween could never have been re-created with Carpenters flair but Rob Zombie botched the job completely. The bar was low for Friday the 13th but the filmmakers nevertheless undershot the target. And now perhaps expectedly A Nightmare on Elm Street has re-invented this series into something depressingly generic. Bayer provides a few good ""boo"" moments but not a lot more. The hope is that this will be a one-and-done but the true nightmare is that well be subjected to a sequel.

The remake of Wes Cravens classic leaves a lot to be desired. (Photo Courtesy of Warner Bros. P) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday April 29 2010 256 PM Title Nightmare on Elm Street (2010) The studio optimist who wrote the official press notes for ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" describes Freddy Kruegers latest appearance as ""a reinvention of the seminal 1984 horror classic."" In reality its more like a bludgeoning.The fan anxiety over Jackie Earle Haley replacing Robert Englund turns out to be warranted Haleys a fine actor but he was far scarier in the suburban drama ""Little Children."" And Englunds unpredictable presence is definitely missed.Dont blame Haley though. Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserers screenplay goes in the wrong direction entirely dropping Freddys sick sense of humor while turning him into a generic bogeyman.Novice director Samuel Bayer returns to the initial Elm Street crime scene where high-school senior Nancy (Rooney Mara) is being stalked by Freddy in her dreams. Other students (including ""Twilights"" Kellan Lutz) are also tortured when they fall asleep though no one knows why.With help from her mom (Connie Britton) and boyfriend (Kyle Gallner) Nancy learns that Freddy was once a pedophile preying on preschoolers. She and her friends were his final victims before their enraged parents set him on fire. Years later hes returned for revenge.When he kills someone in her sleep she dies in reality so Nancys only hope is to stay awake. But all the Red Bull in the world wont keep her and her friends up forever.While the filmmakers plundered Wes Cravens original for their plot they neglected to retain other essential elements like a genuine sense of dread. Bayer doesnt even know how to exploit the potential terror of nightmares.And he cares even less about the characters. Haleys reptilian menace is lost under all that makeup along with Freddys personality. The rest of the cast is encouraged to behave in equally bland fashion so talented actors like Gallner and Britton are completely wasted.If all youre looking for are cheap scares youll find a few minor jolts and a decent - though not interesting or unusual - amount of gore. But be warned You may need your own case of Red Bull just to make it all the way through.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Movie review aA Nightmare on Elm Streeta - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-HorrorMovie review aA Nightmare on Elm StreetaJackie Earle Haley is Freddy Krueger this time in producer Michael Bayas resurrection of the horror franchise.April 30 2010|By Robert Abele Special to the Los Angeles Times Horror movie franchises a as its been said about Marines a dont die apparently. They just go to hell and regroup. Now comes the return of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" thanks in part to producer Michael Bay who when hes not frightening movie snobs as a director has made something of a profitable side job resurrecting scare brands a ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" ""The Amityville Horror"" ""Friday the 13th"" a from the pop-culture graveyard. This time around hes coaxed back the estimably creepy Freddy Krueger from our bloody memories but its hardly what youd call a dream reunion. The first ""Nightmare"" was the brainchild of horrormeister Wes Craven who looked to embolden the slasher era with a child killer let loose during sleepy time Reality-bending imagery added to the usual rip-and-bleed gore craft. Although the fedora-sporting finger-knived Freddy (iconically rendered by Robert Englund) would over the course of seemingly hundreds of sequels devolve into a quippy circus act in the agreeably cheesy 1984 original he was well original a disreputable genres very own incubus. Faced with everyone knowing the drill with Freddy then the rebooters here a writers Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer and director Samuel Bayer a seek a little sympathy for their devil. To that end actors actor Jackie Earle Haley has been cast as Freddy whose dreamtime terrorizing of a handful of attractive teens a led by Rooney Mara and Kyle Gallner cast out of the Kristen Stewart- Robert Pattinson school of pasty glum adolescence a comes with a fleshed-out backstory of how a friendly preschool gardener met a possibly unjust fiery end at the hands of a parental lynch mob. But Freddys genesis just isnt that helpful to the cause of unnerving moviegoers. Psychoanalyzing a murdering creep didnt work with Rob Zombies "" Halloween"" (poor abused Michael Myers) and its a mostly ludicrous diversion here despite Haleys game turn in the burn mask. What we want are freaky visuals and as an exercise in ""re-imagining"" to use Hollywoods favorite rehash euphemism this ""Nightmare"" is mostly stale goods. Youd think Bayers music video background would jibe well with the playful surreality of Cravens premise. But when not paying homage a the claw in the bathtub the morphing wall a Bayer surprisingly traffics in factory-level horror atmospherics and loud saw-it-coming shocks. In the end your last fever dream about failing to study for an exam was probably scarier. calendarlatimes.com Clicking on Green Links will take you to a third-party e-commerce site.

Artificial slope to open at Buck Hill this fall next Movies 92434224 Review ""Elm Street"" ends in dull cul-de-sac Umpteenth movie in the Freddy K. franchise is disturbingly unoriginal.  |  1/2 out of 4 stars By COLIN COVERT Star Tribune April 29 2010 -- 732pm Warner Bros. Courtesy New Line Productions I Jackie Earle Haley is Freddy Krueger in ""A Nightmare on Elm Street."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Like a cover band with more stagecraft than talent ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" looks good recycling ""greatest hits"" moments but fails to capture the excitement of the original. The much-revived Freddy Kruegers ninth return to the screen is a subpar exercise hardly the stuff dreams are made of. Primitive production values overwrought acting and dreadful hairstyles notwithstanding Wes Cravens 1984 ""Nightmare"" offered the first fresh horror concept in eons. Freddy was a bad dream come to life a monster who wakes up when you go to sleep. A child molester burned to death by upstanding suburban vigilantes he returned to torture their now-teenaged kids. Skulking around his victims subconscious he could take any form and he taunted their helplessness with maniacal glee. Who can forget Freddys tongue licking a pretty teens face through the mouthpiece of her phone as he sneered ""Im your boyfriend now""? That line recurs in the new film alongside images and entire sequences replicated beat for beat. Whats lacking is the imagination inspiration and emotional impact that made the original a touchstone of the genre. Once again high-school classmates who share a dream of a knife-fingered man have to figure out why they are dying in their sleep. One slits his own throat. Another levitates from her bed and crashes around the ceiling before being gutted by invisible knives. A third is menaced by a talon-fingered glove that surfaces in her bathtub between her defenselessly open legs. Parents stonewall their childrens efforts to unravel the mystery and the surviving few youngsters gobble uppers to try and stay awake. Sound familiar? Except for topical references to Red Bull and the Internet this is very much like your fathers ""Nightmare on Elm Street."" And yet the warmed-over tale lacks the disturbing snap it once had. Craven slyly hinted at the associations between sex and death in his teen heroes dreams but theres not a moment here as delicious as Cravens vision of teen heartthrob Johnny Depp being eaten by a bed. The freakout imagery and filmmaking legerdemain of Cravens classic is replaced by a river of blood. Horror jolts are added intelligence subtracted. This new ""Nightmare"" is a film made by and for thuddingly literal-minded people. Its a far cry from this springs nerve-wracking revival of George Romeros 1973 bio-terror shocker ""The Crazies"" a case study in how to make a remake. A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for strong bloody horror violence disturbing images terror and language. ""Nightmare"" is handsomely shot and lit to moody perfection but perfunctory. Director Samuel Bayer avoids originality as if it were contractually forbidden. He doesnt understand tension. Bayer delivers Spookshow 101 scares -- thundering shock chords sucker-punch bursts of action from the corner of the frame. Actual dread is beyond his grasp. He tries for a spine-tingle by having Freddy drag his claws across metal pipes but that old effect lost its charge about six ""Nightmares"" ago. Bayer has no grasp of pacing either. Death is meted out with such dull metronome regularity that the mind drifts. Did no one notice that Katie Cassidy Rooney Mara and ""Twilights"" Kellan Lutz in their mid-20s make preposterous high-school students? Is it a deliberate joke that characters enter and depart through windows so often? Why hire a capable actor like Jackie Earle Haley only to defeat him with Freddys scarface makeup? In the moments when hes unencumbered by latex hes effectively creepy and moving. If Haleys bound to a series of sequels hell truly be trapped in a nightmare.

The most imaginatively conceived of 1980s horror franchises ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" degenerated fast after Wes Cravens 84 original as Robert Englunds Freddy Krueger became a standup ghoul dispensing limp wisecracks to teens in baroque death throes. Thus it seemed possible a reboot might be more corrective than redundant -- especially with the inspired choice of Jackie Earle Haley as Freddy 2.0. Alas little about New Lines return to the well delivers on that promise. Nevertheless fan anticipation should mean big biz even if this new ""Nightmare"" has as tough a time re-raising the tentpole as other recent slasher retrofits. Haleys startling comeback turn as a repulsive yet pathetic pederast in ""Little Children"" three years ago certainly qualified him to breathe new life into the striped sweater of this child-abusing villain. (The closest thing to a significant update in Wesley Strick and Eric Hesslers script is the shift in cultural paranoias Instead of a dead child murderer Freddy is now a dead child molester who worked at a preschool and whose victims recover repressed memories of trauma.) Wearing more realistic extreme-burn-victim makeup and afforded longer pre-ghoul flashbacks in order to play the role straight (at least until some de rigueur lame puns later on) Haley still doesnt get the chance to lend Freddy genuinely creepy dimension. Just one scene as quietly insidiously suggestive as the actors car date with Jane Adams in ""Children"" would have been a game-changer. But this ""Nightmare"" is too busy cramming in routine shock cuts to take such a risk. Likewise no time is devoted to establishing premise (its assumed weve seen prior incarnations so why bother?) atmosphere or character depth. And while the original pic wasnt so hot in those departments either it nevertheless felt more grounded in a credible world. Sticking close to its story template (and reproducing several specific scares) pic opens with Dean (Kellan Lutz) already terrorized by sleeping visions of the knife-fingered Mr. Krueger. Trying to stay awake in a diner he falls prey to what girlfriend Kris (Katie Cassidy) and other horrified onlookers assume is a suicidal urge. Realizing that ""when he kills you in your sleep you stay dead"" Kris finds shes sharing the same deadly dreams with fellow high schoolers Jesse (Thomas Dekker) Quentin (Kyle Gallner) and Nancy (Rooney Mara). They soon glean theyre linked by hideous events that took place when they were 5-year-olds -- events their parents have tried to bury. Unfortunately vengeful Freddys spirit digs them up. Less fortunately still none of this is very frightening. Vet musicvid director Samuel Bayers feature debut does nothing glaringly wrong but theres not much thats inventively right either. The slickly assembled widescreen pic has no distinctive style and scant imagination not even in the realm of those fantasy f/x that kept the original series colorfully diverting. While the 1984 film has aged its now-familiar jolts still pack more punch than this pics recycled ones which sometimes register so tepidly as to cause snickers. Craven also had a sure hand with his junior thesps (including young Johnny Depp); Bayers TV-drafted leads are less deftly handled with Mara and Gallner making a charisma-free climactic duo. By then a screenplay that can hardly be accused of taking too many liberties with the source material has managed to flub its own premise For no apparent reason in the last reel or so Freddy seems able to manifest whether the kids are asleep or not. Packaging is glossy by genre standards. A Nightmare on Elm StreetProductionA Warner Bros. release of a New Line Cinema presentation of a Platinum Dune production.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Wes Cravens 1984 horror film A Nightmare On Elm Street owes at least part of its success to reasons evident in the title. For his setting Craven didnt use some cobwebbed old house or fog-drenched Eastern European village but like John Carpenters Halloween a bucolic suburban anywhere the sort of prosperous picket-fence neighborhood previous generations had strived hard to reach. But Elm Street had a troubled past that included child murders vigilante justice and in Freddy Krueger a dream-haunting bogeyman determined to shed some teenage blood to make sure everyone knew about it. Cravens film has its creaky moments but the powerful notion of a whole generation dying in a ruined All-American paradise thanks to the sins of their parents made them easy to ignore. So too did Cravens inventive low-budget surrealism and Robert Englunds portrayal of Krueger a casually relentless undead maniac driven by a perverse sense of justice. Sadly the above paragraph could double as a catalog of whats missing from this remake another slick updating of a horror classic from Michael Bays Platinum Dunes imprint the production company responsible for 21st century remakes of Friday The 13th The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and others. Director Samuel Bayer a veteran commercial and music video director responsible for Nirvanas ""Smell Like Teen Spirit Video"" back when the original Nightmare series was still a going concern brings a slick visual sense but not a hint of vision. The film cops virtually every memorable image from the original but loses the depth that gave them power and the sense of place that grounded them. And while after Little Children this officially confirms Jackie Earle Haley as the go-to actor to play child molesters his Krueger simply isnt that threatening more a fidgety runt than the stuff of cold sweat-inducing bad dreams. Bayer keeps repeating the image of teenage characters--some like lead Rooney Mara who look almost old enough to have teen kids of their own--waking up screaming as if trying to convince the audience they were watching a scarier movie than they are. No matter how often the film returns to the same foreboding boiler room or how much the sound design pushes the sound of flesh getting cut--which for some reason sounds like metal on metal--theres little to be frightened of here. (Unless of course you count the creepy way Bayer tries to wring gross-out thrills from images of child molestation.) Some recurring dreams get less powerful with repetition.

No seriously Freddys back again? How is that possible? Hes a psycho killer and all but still hes been through a lot since the original ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" back in 1984. After all those sequels youd think arthritis would have set into those knived fingers of his. The sixth ""Elm Street"" movie allegedly was the ""Final Nightmare"" and still more films followed. Now we have a reinvention of the first movie -- lets not call it a remake that would be crass -- with Jackie Earle Haley filling in for the venerable Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger. Wes Cravens core nugget of a concept remains intact in ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" that if you die in your dreams you die in real life. It was truly inventive and disturbing then -- the idea that falling asleep could be deadly -- and it allowed for an exploration of the frightening power of the subconscious. With his jaunty fedora and torn sweater his hideous scorched skin and his arsenal of one-liners Freddy could be anywhere at any time. There was no way to stop him. At some point youve gotta fall asleep.

Cranston Hamm more Toy Story toys burn up in prank on mom By now though the novelty has long since worn off and cheap generic scares are all that are left. The first feature from commercial and music-video director Samuel Bayer has a more artful look than you might expect from a horror remake; he also directed Nirvanas ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" video and his ""Elm Street"" has a similar steamy sheen. Some of his dream imagery can be striking too a young woman walking barefoot through the snow in her bedroom or a carpeted hallway that turns into a river of bloody sludge. But theres not much in the way of genuine suspense. If one of Bayers characters is experiencing a quiet moment alone -- in a car in bed in front of the bathroom mirror -- you know were only seconds away from a loud screechy shock cut. Its obvious and its repetitive. As for the story the script from Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer pretty closely follows the original. A group of teenagers played by actors in their mid-20s (Rooney Mara Kyle Gallner Katie Cassidy Thomas Dekker and Kellan Lutz) find themselves haunted by the same menacing man Freddy Krueger who chases and slashes at them in his dreams. Why this happens to them now simultaneously seems arbitrary but whatever. Slideshow 10 horror-movie icons Theyre all connected to him through their childhood but they cant figure out how (Kruegers pedophilia is spelled out more explicitly in this one which seems like a needless and gratuitous attempt to shock us). And one by one he takes them out despite their best efforts to stay awake. Haley seems wasted in the role though. This is someone who can really act who can be deeply creepy as evidenced by his Oscar-nominated work in ""Little Children."" Here he seems smothered by the special-effects makeup the distorted voice the cheesy puns ""You really shouldnt fall asleep in class."" Not that any of this matters though.

Comments (1) A Nightmare on Elm Street Video Rated R  95 minutes  2010 Using blasts of shrill high-decibel noise in place of actual scares has become a common horror-movie tactic the cinematic equivalent of botox silicone and penile-enhancement surgery. Producer Michael Bay (Transformers) and director Samuel Bayer (making his big-screen debut after a career in music video) deploy the tactic so regularly in this remake of Wes Cravens 1984 classic that after a while I just plugged my ears. Jackie Earle Haley takes over for Robert Englund as dream demon Freddy Krueger though in a cheap echo of Haleys comeback role in Little Children the backstory has been changed to make Freddy a child molester.

"A Nightmare on Elm Street Not what youd re-imagine - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 2 starsA Nightmare on Elm Street Not what youd re-imagineApril 29 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie critic""You gotta stop that kinda dreamin"" said the naive mother in the original 1984 ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and of course the advice was not heeded and Freddy Krueger (billed as ""Fred Krueger"") and his metallic claw-fingers wiped out teenager after teenager and a franchise was born. Director Wes Cravens film never did get the critical respect of say John Carpenters first "" Halloween"" but its creepiest scenes -- the body-bag appearance at the high school the bedroom sequence showing a Krueger attack without showing Krueger -- revealed more filmmaking smarts and gore-oriented invention than audiences could find in the entire bankrupt ""Friday the 13th"" series. Every title in the previous paragraph has been subjected to a remake or two by now including ""Nightmare."" The new one is slick enough marking director Samuel Bayers feature debut. (His videos include ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams."") By todays standards it is only medium-bloody though its more than usually grim its young protagonists sullen enough to qualify for the ""Twilight"" movies. Yet it affords precious little sadistic pleasure partly because it ""dares"" to lay out more directly the pedophiliac demons plaguing Freddy the serial killer. Even when he was just a serial killer without the pedophilia Freddy was a mixed blessing as far as slasher anti-heroes go. The notion that a boogeyman a specter in a fedora and melted skin could flit from nightmare to nightmare appearing anywhere at any time and then disappearing -- well if someone or something has that much latitude youre dealing with a perilous shortage of narrative rules. Its a strength and a weakness. With Cravens original the blurred borderlines between dreamscape and reality gave the best images an eerie force and unpredictability. The remake works the same idea to death. After the 40th or 50th sudden appearance of either human or inhuman figure at the window or in the bed or in the bathroom mirror you feel as if you may be expiring yourself death by a thousand shock cuts. I hope Jackie Earle Haley drew a nice fat check for this assignment; the role asks criminally little of him beneath all that goopy melted-face makeup yet he enjoys top billing. (Rent ""Little Children"" if you prefer to see Haley create a genuinely frightening portrayal.) As the ""Nightmare"" remakes dour sleep-deprived teens attempt to fend off the worst and keep their throats intact the movie settles for less and less though occasionally you get an image to remember. The last 10 seconds for example bring the shock plus a certain precision missing from the previous hour and a half. Ive seen far worse horror remakes but lets not grade on too much of a curve This ""Nightmare"" offers dutifully grinding thrills of a routine sort. mjphillipstribune.com 2 stars MPAA rating R (for strong bloody horror violence disturbing images terror and language)Cast Jackie Earle Haley (Freddy Krueger); Rooney Mara (Nancy); Kyle Gallner (Quentin); Katie Cassidy (Kris); Thomas Dekker (Jesse); Kellan Lutz (Dean)Credits Directed by Samuel Bayer; written by Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer based on Wes Cravens 1984 film; produced by Michael Bay Andrew Form and Brad Fuller. A Warner Bros. Pictures release. Running time 142. for original tooFrom Gene Siskels Nov. 26 1984 review""In Nightmare on Elm Street the tired gimmick is whether its all a dream or whether there really exists a creepy guy trying to do in a quartet of teenagers. But enough sequences ... turn out to be dreams so that early on we sit back in defense of the films terror not wanting to be suckered into being fearful knowing that sooner or later someone is going to wake up and rub their eyes.""

The figure of Freddy Krueger a deformed child molester fond of striped sweaters who wielded a set of steak knives for fingers and killed his victims in their sleep was a new and frightening addition to the ranks of memorable horror-movie monsters. But over the course of seven sequels the creep gradually became the anti-hero of his films instead of the villain dispatching his prey with Henny Youngman one-liners while the audience laughed instead of screaming. In 2003s surprisingly effective Freddy Vs. Jason in which Krueger squared off against Jason Voorhees in a winner-take-all battle worthy of pro wrestling the character completed the cross-over into comedic territory. After that film Freddy Krueger seemed to be done for good. One of the problems with the new A Nightmare on Elm Street the latest horror remake from Michael Bays Platinum Dunes production company is that Freddy simply isnt as scary as he used to be even though Jackie Earle Haley taking over from Robert Englund in the role plays Krueger essentially straight keeping the one-liners to a minimum. But the actor isnt given enough to do to leave his mark on the character It could be anybody under that gruesome makeup. Director Samuel Bayer a music video veteran making his feature film debut pays dutiful homage to a couple of the most memorable images from the original (such as Freddy emerging from behind a wall to leer at a sleeping girl or the bathtub scene in which the razor-tipped hand emerges from the bubbles) but comes up with a few new twists of his own. The screenplay by Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer generally follows the original including (spoiler alert) the Psycho-inspired twist of the sudden death of a character you assume is going to be the films heroine. But if the film ever explained how exactly Krueger gained the ability to invade peoples dreams and murder them in their sleep I missed it. Bayer also refrains from going overboard with the camera stylings The film is well-shot and makes effective use of the widescreen format. A Nightmare on Elm Street isnt offensively bad the way The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake was but it is redundant and uninvolving because the movie doesnt add any new wrinkles to the Krueger mythos This is pretty much the same movie as the original only with better production values. Worst of all there isnt a single good fright in the entire picture an unforgivable sin for a supposedly scary movie. The horror film genre is filled with classics that have endured the test of time and become milestones of cinematic history Frankenstein The Exorcist Rosemarys Baby Psycho The Silence of the Lambs Dawn of the Dead The Birds Halloween Jaws. Today though the genre is on life support consisting primarily of remakes and sequels designed to lure teenagers on opening weekend make a quick buck and then fade into oblivion. Craven who jumpstarted the moribund horror genre with 1996s Scream recently signed on to direct Scream 4 which he promises will be as revolutionary and surprising as the first film. Heres hoping he delivers Too many more remakes as dull and bland as A Nightmare on Elm Street could kill off horror movies for good. A Nightmare on Elm Street ( out of ) opens on Friday April 30.

I still say the ""Chainsaw"" remake was solid if conventional entertainment ... even if no one believes me - including you apparently ) Horror fans simply must check out the indie scene - its where the best movies in this genre are being made. Consider ""Eden Lake"" ""Splinter"" and ""Rogue"" as three examples. Even ""The Descent Part 2"" is a satisfactory shocker far better than this new ""Nightmare"" which is as weak as you describe. Posted by Christian Toto | April 29 2010 at 0851 AM Youre right Christian Most of the good horror movies being made in the U.S. today are low-budget indies. I enjoyed Splinter a lot too. France is also in the midst of a nice horror-film boom (Them and Martyrs come to mind). Tell No One is more of a thriller than horror but it is terrific. And theres this Danish movie called ""The Substitute"" that is fantastic. Its a horror movie aimed at children but it works just as well for grown-ups and it proves you dont need graphic gore to scare the audience (not that I have anything against gratuitous gore). I highly recommend that one if you havent seen it. Posted by Rene Rodriguez | April 29 2010 at 0244 PM There are good recent Horror films out there.Dont forget ""Let The Right One In"" from Sweden. I saw it twice in the theatre. Something I very rarely do. Posted by mrbluelouboyle | April 29 2010 at 0912 PM What an absolute shame. Freddy really could have benefited from a nice new shot in the arm. Instead this is just another cheap cash grab. thene ven waste Jackie Earl haley. Terrible. Posted by Juan | April 30 2010 at 0156 AM I love this movie is my favorite Posted by nacho | June 05 2010 at 0448 PM Candidly I shun horror movies for obvious reasons. However reading in this review I am destined to change my stand and see the movie for myself. Posted by island life | February 08 2011 at 0237 AM The comments to this entry are closed.
