We havent had one of those since The Bone Collector back before her Oscar and that weird period where she and Billy Bob were wearing lockets around their necks with each others blood. (Have those turned up on eBay yet?) Directed by D.J. Caruso Didnt he do that Salton Sea picture? Strange thing about The Salton Sea--a not-disreputable writer I know thought it was a towering masterwork and voted for it over and over at a year-end critics society meeting. Every time his ballot came around it got big laughs. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and watched it again last week thinking maybe Id let a classic go by It does have a nice methamphetamine buzz and Val Kilmers first give-a-shit performance in years and a gonzo bit by Vincent DOnofrio as a cartoon-psycho drug dealer with no nose. But its still one crapola revenge melodrama. Anyway Taking Lives looked like a decent serial time-killer what with Wacky Angie and Ethan Hawke two casualties of horrific Hollywood breakups (Ethans reported infidelities on the Taking Lives shoot got him in hot water with Uma) plus former booze-hound and failed Julia Roberts-fiance Kiefer Sutherland--now after 24 sobriety and marriage the relatively stable presence on the set. Top-flight moody French actors imported to play Quebecois detectives. Autopsies. Gory murder-scene pix. Yummy. Lets go. Advertisement Angelina is first seen stretched out in an open grave. Shes an FBI profiler and is trying to get into the killers head. The killer meanwhile is trying to get into Angies head and will later tell her ""We are the same""--a line that could better be said of serial-killer screenwriters. Also most serial killers are more grounded than Angie. She spends hours and hours staring at autopsy photos posting them above her bed and spreading them around her while she eats. Later she says that you can tell who the psychos are because they look at rape and murder pictures as casually as they eat. That implicates her and it implicates me since I kept eating my popcorn. Ethan Hawke is a witness who might be the target of the killer. An interesting conundrum Is he acting badly or is he the killer and therefore pretending (badly) to be someone hes not? Kiefer is presented as the likely killer in the first 15 minutes which means hes the only one in the cast who you can safely write off. Angelina is good but those gelled locks dangling artfully in front of her eyes must interfere with her powers of observation. My own were considerably heightened by the sight of those knockers unsheathed. Caruso is not a negligible filmmaker. He comes up with two nifty scares one involving a clever fake-out The music begins to BUILD so that you know that something HORRIBLE IS COMING. Then you get something a little horrible. Then when youve exhaled and you go ""Was that it?"" you get a BIG BOO Caruso is a much more resourceful director than this material deserves but I resented being two steps ahead of the genius profiler and the genius serial-killer. Of course I am a serial killer of serial-killer movies. And you and I dear reader of serial-killer reviews of serial-killer movies we are the same. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

(AP Photo/Takashi Seida) Photo TAKASHI SEIDA Taking Lives loses its dramatic way when Jolie shifts from work to play 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Taking Lives Suspense. Starring Angelina Jolie Ethan Hawke Gena Rowlands. Directed by D.J. Caruso. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. Agent Illeana Scott (Angelina Jolie) is an FBI profiler who can intuit serial killers motives by touch. Her hair also has special powers. When it comes down ""Taking Lives"" falls apart. To buy this picture you have to buy Jolies character and the actress succeeds much of the time. But once her contained job-obsessed agent gets involved with a man close to her case much of what came before is negated. The tense stylish thriller turns into soft-core slapdash psychodrama. ""Taking Lives"" directed by D.J. Caruso (""Nick of Time"") starts with a compelling sequence in which the killer as a nerdy 1980s teenager (Paul Dano) murders his traveling companion in the Canadian countryside. The sepia tones vintage rock music and actor Danos show of furtive delight portend an eerie edgy movie. The picture jumps to present-day Montreal where Agent Scott is helping local cops investigate the serial killers latest murder. She surmises that the madman has been assuming the identities of his victims for 20 years. Jolies casting at first seems like a terrific melding of role and persona. The actress known for her dark side is introduced with a slow pan across her body as her character lies in a grave trying to discern clues. Jolie downplays her exotic looks as a career gal whose careful demeanor wavers only when excited by a new lead. She eats dinner while studying photos of corpses. The self-possessed agent doesnt react when a Montreal detective (Olivier Martinez from ""Unfaithful"" his English a challenge at times) makes a piggish remark in French. Only later does she reveal that she too speaks French with a sly smile crossing her face. Consumed by her case and fearless in exploring creepy places with a flashlight Agent Scott seems immune to the two gorgeous men around her Martinezs detective and Ethan Hawkes art dealer who has been called in as a witness. The jolts are minimal but director Caruso and screenwriter Jon Bokenkamp (adapting a book by Michael Pye) seem to be going for something subtler. All the characters appear to have demons and the film takes its time in revealing what they are. Hawke and Gena Rowlands (as the killers mother) are especially good at bringing aspects of shadiness to what appear to be stand-up characters. Jolie and Hawke show a sense of play in an interrogation scene where the FBI officers cool-headedness unnerves the witness. Thats all before Jolies shift into crime-fighting sexpot. Agent Scott starts running down halls jacket open and breasts jiggling. Her previously pinned hair falls into a Renaissance mane as her luxury hotel room (the FBI apparently has generous per diems) becomes a boudoir complete with gauzy fabrics and mood lighting. She succumbs with great enthusiasm to a guy she barely knows in a laughable display of vertical eroticism. Jolies toplessness goes beyond gratuitous to regrettable for an actress of her stature. Once the film sells out Jolies character the visual flourishes vanish each character loses about 20 IQ points and a preposterous scheme is enacted to trap the killer. Its as if the filmmakers decided at the 11th hour that a nuanced approach was too sophisticated and that they needed to inject cheap exploitative elements. If they had to sacrifice Jolie and the other talented actors in the process so be it. -- Advisory This film contains violence sexuality situations nudity.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Taking Lives Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/taking-lives-2004,200,takinglives9,takinglives,rogerebert
"Predictably lurid Taking Lives has plenty of heat few chills - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Predictably lurid Taking Lives has plenty of heat few chills By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  March 19 2004 When we first see Special Agent Illeana Scott (Angelina Jolie) in ""Taking Lives"" shes lying in a grave. She explains to the pair of French-Canadian detectives whove found her there that shes trying to determine the exact nature of the murders theyre investigating. The two men have the same look Oui mademoiselle but why are you smiling? Well boys shes Angelina Jolie and she just wants to freak you out.Its a minor relief to know that after a pair of preposterous love stories and a second forgettable stint as the tomb-raiding archeologist Lara Croft Jolie is safely back in the arms of another murky-kinky piece of Hollywood trash. There was some doubt cast about whether shed be able to top the inane window-fogger ""Original Sin"" in which Antonio Banderas knew Jolie was trying to kill him but couldnt stop having sex with her anyway. ""Taking Lives"" operates on a similarly stupid premise that respectful of those who live for smutty rubbish I wont disclose. But this is easily the ghastlier and to some extent more predictable movie You know who the killer is the moment he appears. Heck youll know by a quick look at the trailer.Jolie plays a super-serious American FBI profiler who wears expensive flattering shirts and has been lured up to Montreal to help catch a serial killer. Her services come over the objection of Paquette a pouty insensitive rogue played by Olivier Martinez. (The good cop in the relationship is Jean-Hugues Anglades Duval.) Yet if only Paquette could see how Scott lives for her work taking her meals seated across the table from grisly crime scene photos and taping yet more pictures to the ceiling above her bed.Her devotion to her job is ridiculous but it gets her and her Canadian crew ever closer to the bottom of the case which is kicked into high gear when the investigation turns up Jimmy Costa (Ethan Hawke) an art dealer and Nova Scotian who says he witnessed the latest murder. Costa is drawn inevitably to Scott. Eventually she discloses to him that the gold band on her ring finger is a decoy and almost quits the case because she too is drawn to him. And as the presumable killer nears the two grow closer. And closer. Until Hawke and Jolie embark on some of the sloppiest kissing and wholehearted trysting this side of Adult Cinemax.It should go without saying that sex is what Agent Scott needed to induce her giggling and spontaneity. Imagine what a different movie ""The Silence of the Lambs"" would have been if Agent Starling was seeing someone other than Dr. Lechter. (Imagine Dr. Lechters response.)""Taking Lives"" would not be possible without that movie or without David Finchers ""Se7en."" As the imitations still proliferate one develops an appreciation of the way Finchers movie in particular squeezed a fashionably apocalyptic mood into a clever structure.""Taking Lives"" wants to make you jump which on two or three occasions it does but those moments arent fastened to anything more than the wish to jolt you. We never learn why our killer kills. We never learn what makes our federal huntress tick. The answers to these questions are probably in Michael Pyes 1999 novel which seemed a brisk riff on Truman Capotes ""In Cold Blood"" and the works of Patricia Highsmith. However the adaptation is such a radical departure from Pyes book that its as though screenwriter Jon Bokenkamp used a recipe for apple pie to make meatloaf.Because the characters in the movie have only stock obsessions and vague personal histories theres no reason to be interested in them. And the movie which D.J. Caruso has directed as a collection of sequences that grow in nonsense and luridness doesnt bring out the psycho-schlock needed to work as a transcendently bad thriller. The gruesome last sequence set in an idyllic Pennsylvania farmhouse is the sort of tasteless moviemaking that debases far more than it transcends.The serial-killer thriller is a genre that officially has nowhere else to go and nothing else to say. And ""Taking Lives"" is so lifeless and beside the point that its DVD version should skip letterboxing and just be shown in a heavy chalk outline. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Is Ethan Hawke the killer or just a killer target? Warner Bros. Familiarity breeds ennui especially when Lives lead Angelina Jolie isnt exactly synonymous with adrenaline these days after the putridly dull Lara Croft and the stillborn Beyond Borders. This one clocks in at a glacial pace even for a mood piece (admittedly well shot by Amir M. Mokri) thatll put you in the mood for any alternative. Were in Quebec and Montreal where the sun never shines and the killer is being sleuthed by ... an American FBI agent? Maybe theres a precedent; if J. Edgar Hoover were still running the bureau hed probably banish to another country a looker who is better at her job than most men. If only the movie made us believe that this were true. Cut to Gena Rowlands looking mighty worried telling the local law (including Tcheky Karyo and Unfaithfuls Olivier Martinez) that she has almost certainly just spotted a decades-dead son who has to be up to no good. It turns out that lots of ""no good"" has been going on for a long time. Jolie eventually surmises that an assailant has been knocking off victims and assuming their identities until he gets bored enough to repeat the cycle. ABOUT THE MOVIE Taking Lives  (out of four) Stars Angelina Jolie Ethan Hawke Tcheky Karyo Olivier Martinez Kiefer Sutherland Director D.J. Caruso Distributor Warner Bros. Rating R for strong violence including disturbing images language and some sexuality Opens Friday nationwide The movies overriding question Is Ethan Hawke the killer or just a killer target? Hawke acts a bit squirrelly though not so much that the otherwise somnambulant Jolie doesnt have to keep a check on her libido. But for a while Hawke is the only one we suspect until a red herring played by Kiefer Sutherland belatedly shows up. The casting seems a little too convenient this close to Sutherlands creepy contribution in Phone Booth. From the opening credits (by far the best scene) Lives seems bound to recapture the queasy mood of 1995s Seven. But its too dull to even pull off quease until a notably unpleasant climax. Meanwhile Philip Glass score tries to slosh on a veneer of importance. Compared with this movie last weeks Glass-scored Secret Window almost seems like Rear Window. This anticlimactic grind is hardly salvaged by the kind of twist ending thatll have you turning to your date and saying ""Who do you think will make the Final Four?"" For those who have better things to do (reading Proust scraping burger residue off the backyard grill) the trouble with indulging Taking Lives is that its taking your time.

As these stop-him-before-he-kills-again manhunt yarns go this ones several cuts above the norm which should spell sturdy early spring biz for this Angelina Jolie-Ethan Hawke starrer. ""Taking Lives"" is a somber absorbing thriller that treads familiar psycho serial killer terrain with style. Elegantly made and comparatively restrained in cramming sick and grisly stuff down the audiences throat pic builds tensely to a major revelation made with a half-hour left to go after which the action becomes more conventional. But as these stop-him-before-he-kills-again manhunt yarns go this ones several cuts above the norm which should spell sturdy early spring biz for this Angelina Jolie-Ethan Hawke starrer. An American feature shot in Montreal that for once owns up to its setting and makes full use of the citys atmospheric old section this smart adaptation of Michael Pyes novel centers on FBI Special Agent Illeana Scott (Jolie) a profiler called in by Canadian authorities to help solve a case in what seems to be part of a string of killings dating back two decades. Prologue clearly explains that the killer began his career by assuming the identity of his victim ""life-jacking"" his personality until it was time to move on a practice hes since repeated all too successfully. For her part Illeana is introduced lying in a grave trying to absorb and intuit everything she can about the fresh murder and is subsequently earmarked as a woman apart when shes glimpsed calmly eating dinner alone while meditating on a group of gruesome crime scene photographs. The cops led by Surete director Leclair (Tcheky Karyo) and detectives Paquette (Olivier Martinez) and Duval (Jean-Hugues Anglade) sense they might be closing in on the killer when a young painter James Costa (Hawke) a bystander who interrupted the maniacs latest attack is able to provide a good description of him resulting in a portrait that looks a good deal like Kiefer Sutherland. Furthering the effort is a Mrs. Asher (Gena Rowlands) who reports to police that shes just seen the ""very dangerous"" son who disappeared 19 years back. She later gives Illeana the key info that the missing son Martin was one of two twins the other of whom supposedly perished as a teenager. Illeana ultimately pieces together the killers hermit crab-like profile just as speaking of Costa she quietly confesses to her old pal Leclair as to ""having a reaction to the witness. Favorable."" The attraction is clearly mutual but any physicality between the two is tenaciously held in check until the case appears to be closed after the Sutherland character finally emerges. Then all hell breaks loose carnally criminally and dramatically. Dialogue by scripter Jon Bokenkamp who helmed the indie ""Preston Tylk"" in 2000 is crisp and economical giving the proficient thesps just enough to create some shadings in roles that are first and foremost pieces in a puzzle. At films end some inconsistencies and irregularities loom in retrospect but only a couple are jarring during the experience. Overdoing things far less than he did on his debut feature ""The Salton Sea"" director D.J. Caruso not only uses his locations exceedingly well but in league with lenser Amir Mokri imbues the proceedings in a sultry often rainy darkness frequently pierced by blown window light and shafts of flashlight beams. Vet editor Anne V. Coates keeps the picture taut and the audience on its toes Philip Glass relatively atypical score adds to the mysterious mood and sound mix is dense. In a nicely restrained lid-on performance Jolie can take advantage of her off-screen persona to help fill in the blanks in Illeanas suggestively kinky off-center personality. Having hit his stride as a bigscreen player in ""Training Day"" Hawke continues in fine form here pairing up well with Jolie while familiar French thesps Karyo Martinez and Anglade provide solid support even if they dont exactly sound Quebecois.

Caruso; Author Jon Bokenkamp; Release Date Wide 03/19/2004; Runtime (in minutes) 103; MPAA Rating R Posted March 17 2004 -- 1200 AM EST If you were Angelina Jolie you might take it as a sign that your career is in trouble when you star in a grade-Z serial-killer mystery - and people still think of it as an Ashley Judd movie. (Were ""Celebrity Deathmatch"" around the two would be due for a blood bout.) Taking Lives is a ""Silence of the Lambs""?meets?""Talented Mr. Ripley"" knockoff with all the gore and premonitory ""darkness"" and none of the intrigue. Im well aware that to mock an actress for doing a lousy movie is in effect to punish her for the sins of Hollywood (i.e. there are too few good roles for women) but didnt Jolie realize that ""Taking Lives"" makes her look like a sap? As Illeana Scott an FBI agent in the Clarice Starling mold Jolie utters every line in soft bland neutral tones as if any more expression would compromise her authority. Scott who is helping to solve a series of murders in Montreal has to endure the taunts of the piggish French-Canadian cops (including a smirking Olivier Martinez); shes another female enforcer in a world of male aggression. But that just makes it more ridiculous when she lets herself fall into bed with James Costa (Ethan Hawke) a high-strung artist whos the chief witness in the case and maybe even the killer. Didnt she look around and notice the lack of other suspects? ""Taking Lives"" has a garnish of fancy crime-scene ickiness The killer before taking over the identity of his victims likes to mash in their faces and so there are assorted police photos that feature corpses with heads like hamburger. But after ""Seven"" and three ""Hannibal"" hits the audience tolerance for baroque serial-killer flourishes has been duly amped. We require sustained creativity in our sick violence and ""Taking Lives"" after a token bit of ghastly foreplay loses its life.
