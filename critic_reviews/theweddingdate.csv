An intriguingly racy premise -- a woman hires a top-of-the-line male escort to pose as her significant other -- plays out to listless unsatisfying effect in ""The Wedding Date."" Long hailed as the heiress apparent to Lucille Ball for her work on ""Will amp; Grace"" Debra Messing is clearly being primed here for the sort of romantic-comedy stardom lavished on Julia Roberts. Yet while comparisons to the similarly hooker-themed ""Pretty Woman"" are inevitable perhaps even intended this wan Universal release looks unlikely to match that pics B.O. returns or infectious crowd-pleaser status. Originally conceived under the much better title ""Something Borrowed"" this adaptation of Elizabeth Youngs novel ""Asking for Trouble"" starts with a classic opposites-attract scenario. Anxious high-strung Kat Ellis (Messing) desperately forks over a plane ticket so that devastatingly slick Nick Mercer (Dermot Mulroney) reputedly one of the smoothest operators in New York can accompany her to London for her sisters impending nuptials passing himself off as her boyfriend. A Yank black sheep who hasnt seen her Blighty-based family in two years Kat hopes to make a good impression on her critical mother Bunny (Holland Taylor); her voice-of-sanity father Victor (Peter Egan); and her competitive half-sister Amy (Amy Adams) who is about to wed Edward (Jack Davenport). Shes also dying to save face in front of her ex-boyfriend Jeffrey (Jeremy Sheffield) who just so happens to be the best man -- and possibly make him jealous. The happy recipient of 6000 cash Nick plays along with the charade pretending to be a therapist and turning on the charm full force. While he draws the line at sex (that he warns will cost extra) he thinks nothing of parading in front of Kat stark naked or of dispensing advice on how to loosen up or whispering sweet nothings to beef up her self-esteem. In short hes the perfect guy to save her from her twitchy self-conscious neurotically over-apologetic self. It sounds nice on paper but as laid out in Dana Foxs meandering screenplay this business-arrangement-turned-real-deal unfolds with a lack of focus and energy. Kat is a too-inconsistent comic creation -- wary and prudish one second breezy and reckless the next -- and Messings likable but uneven perf is a series of individually appealing moments that dont always connect. Mulroney comes off as a touch aloof as though vaguely bored. Its not that Messing and Mulroney lack chemistry so much as the fact that Fox and helmer Clare Kilner misjudge their storytelling priorities. They lavish too much time on a subplot involving the sleazy Jeffrey who is floated as a possible rival for Kats affections (with Sheffields improbable charm at odds with the way the character is written). Key plot points like the couples consummation of their relationship and the subsequent emotional fallout are introduced and then dropped without explanation. And aside from one predictable scene where Kat lashes out at the sleaziness of Nicks profession pic doesnt explore as ""Pretty Woman"" did either the tensions or the comic possibilities of embarking on an actual relationship with a paid prostitute. Instead the story veers into a series of melodramatic third-act revelations that assume a deeper investment in the peripheral characters than most auds will be prepared to make. Clocking in at just under 90 minutes ""Date"" feels trimmed down to its bare bones at the frequent expense of logic and narrative clarity. Even the talented ensemble feels under-utilized especially Egan and Holland as Kats parents and Sarah Parish raucous in the role of Kats bawdy chum TJ. Tech contributions are more than adequate with cinematographer Oliver Curtis tackling the bright lights of London and the citys more rural surroundings in classy low-key fashion. Pop soundtrack however is a bland mix lurching from one ill-placed tune to the next in an attempt to underline emotions that havent been filled in onscreen.

She plays sad singleton New Yorker Kat whos dreading her half-sisters wedding in London as it means confronting not only her dysfunctional family but also her ex whos best man. Rather than admit to a hopeless love life she decides to hire male escort Dermot Mulroney to pose as her new beau and make her ex jealous enough to want her back. So can she regain his heart or... no stop wait... could that be love already staring her in the face in the form of her debonair companion...?You can see it all coming a mile off. From its plucky American heroine and British country wedding setting down to its Shania Twain and Maroon 5 soundtrack this seems a sad case of cinema as marketing department memo - its Four Weddings divided by Pretty Woman to the power of Bridget Jones. Correspondingly your enjoyment of it will depend upon how well disposed you are to such antecedents. Messing gets to show off her comic skills and there are a few chucklesome lines plus solid support from British TV talent including Jack Coupling Davenport and Peter Ever Decreasing Circles Egan. Mulroney however is a pretty inert superstud and you never buy his attraction to the messed-up Messing. But this is not the place for emotional insight; in this gossamer-light world such morally dubious acts as say hiring a gigolo to hide your single status from your family arent symptomatic of dark disturbing insecurities but breezily kooky. Watching this is like briefly getting back with an ex - its all very familiar and it gives you a nice warm fuzzy feeling but once thats passed you really hate yourself for it.

"Wedding Date The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; wedding-date-the ) Wedding Date The (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Calling The Wedding Date a ""romantic comedy"" is a misnomer. Its not funny and theres not much romance. Oh the film thinks its got humor - offbeat characters wacky situations goofy faces - but the only members in the audience likely to be chuckling are those who will laugh at anything. And it thinks its romantic - but bringing a male and female together and letting them kiss and make goo-goo eyes at each other is hardly the basis of a good love story. This is a charmless lifeless affair that had me leaving the theater in a mood more appropriate to a funeral than a wedding. This is Dermot Mulroneys second Wedding movie. In his much better first one (My Best Friends Wedding) he played the groom. Here as Nick Mercer hes the male prostitute who has been paid to escort Kat Ellis (Debra Messing) to her sisters nuptials. She doesnt want to go alone and apparently cant get a date without paying for one. Enter Nick who for 6000 and a round-trip ticket to England (where the ceremony is taking place) will fill the role. Sex however isnt part of the package. If its desired theres an extra charge. For Kat consider this added complication her ex-fiancA(c) Jeffrey (Jeremy Sheffield) is the best man. Plus the only member of her family she gets along with is her stepfather (Peter Egan) which is understandable considering how vain and thoroughly unlikable her sister (Amy Adams) and mother (Holland Taylor) are. Anyway unless you have never seen a romantic comedy you know how the story goes. Unfortunately director Clare Kilner and screenwriter Dana Fox assume audience members are so familiar with the formula that they dont bother to develop the relationship between Kat and Nick. It sort of materializes out of thin air. One moment they are client and employee discussing the terms of their arrangement and the next theyre in love. Its something of a mystery how this transition occurs since The Wedding Date never bothers to tell that part of the story. Its too busy annoying us with irritating subplots featuring secondary characters. Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney are pleasing enough to look at (Messing is a lot more attractive here than in her TV series ""Will amp; Grace"") and they have plenty of low-key appeal but theres little evidence of anything resembling a romantic spark between them. If Nick and Kat love each other they do a good job hiding it. Neither actor is well-served by the screenplay which is criminally negligent when it comes to exploring the romance so its hard to blame either of them for The Wedding Dates failures. Formulas are not inherently bad in this sort of motion picture but even with a connect-the-dots story its still necessary to develop characters in which the audience will have a rooting interest. We have to desperately want them to get together regardless of the obstacles. Thats not the case here. At best were marginally invested in Kat and Nicks interaction and the big payoff such as it is is ho-hum. The chief pleasure of any competently made romantic comedy is the vicarious thrill of experiencing the mutual inevitable attraction between the leads. Screen love isnt the same as real love but in a medium like cinema that thrives on fantasy its the next best thing. Its a shame that The Wedding Date misses so many of the details and as a result fails to bring us a romance worth sharing. Ultimately this effort has the stale taste of a made-for-TV movie that found its way into multiplexes along with the fake popcorn butter. In scope intent and execution it comes up small. Even as a chick flick counterprogrammed against the Super Bowl this motion picture isnt likely to find an appreciable or appreciative audience. With its lack of heart and smarts it will disappoint all but the most undemanding of romantic comedy fans.

YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Debra Messing Dermot Mulroney or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? (CNN) -- ""The Wedding Date"" is a sweet mindless diversion that is reminiscent of dozens of other romantic comedies. You know the ones someone walks down the aisle with all the predictable confusion angst and wackiness the writers can wring out of that rite of passage.However this particular wedding-cake walk does feature the excellent comedic timing of Debra Messing and the charm and sex appeal of Dermot Mulroney which will likely combine to make this film a hit with the date crowd.Messing plays Kat Ellis a New York City career woman who is preparing to attend the wedding of her half-sister in England. Theres just one little problem -- she doesnt have a date for the wedding and the best man at the upcoming event is the same guy who recently dumped her after seven years together.Her solution is to hire a professional male escort -- sight unseen -- to go with her to London and pose as her boyfriend.In real life this strategy would have resulted in a nightmare of a guy one more hulk than hunk. But this being a Hollywood movie he turns out to be a perfect gentleman named Nick Mercer played by Mulroney.Thats all you really need to know. The plot is paper-thin and will shred under closer examination. Its obvious first-time screenwriter Dana Fox has watched ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" ""My Best Friends Wedding"" and ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" way too many times.British actor Peter Egan joins the always reliable Holland Taylor in playing Kats parents Bunny and Victor Ellis. Taylor now a star of ""Two and a Half Men"" has played this slightly daffy off-center mother role numerous times and has it down pat.The nasty ex-boyfriend is portrayed by Jeremy Sheffield a suitably good-looking cad. Amy Adams (""Catch Me If You Can"") plays Kats selfish half-sister and another British actor Jack Davenport is great as the slightly clueless groom. And ""Wedding Date"" director Clare Kilner makes the most of the beautiful locations in the Surrey countryside of England.Its a nice turnaround to have the man in a film being the sex object instead of the woman. Mulroney plays a great hooker with a heart of gold and even makes more money than Julia Roberts made performing the same type of role in ""Pretty Woman."" She only got 3000 for her services; Mulroneys Nick makes twice that amount. (Of course it HAS been 15 years.)Messing doesnt stray too far from her role as Grace Adler in her hit TV sitcom ""Will amp; Grace"" so shes on firm ground here. Of course the results are far from groundbreaking.But this little romantic piece of fluff serves its purpose of being a total ""chick flick"" thereby filling a niche that always comes in handy around Valentines Day.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

Times a-wastin so she dips into her 401(k) the better to hire Nick a model beau a Sensitive Man with a Comp Lit degree from Brown who just happens to earn a living toiling in the worlds oldest profession. And so faster than you can say frequent-flier miles -- or conspicuous product placement from Virgin Atlantic -- Kat (Debra Messing) and Nick (Dermot Mulroney) are flying to London for her half-sisters wedding where the ersatz couple will spend a weekend trying to convince Kats family and more important Kats ex that she and Nick are madly in love. Messing and Mulroney hunker down for the night but its the audience whos left snoring.

Preferably one whos drop-dead fine and acts devoted on cue. Amusing premise not-so-amusing execution. Little things get in the way of ""The Wedding Date"" directed by Clare Kilner -- little things like oh a bad script stilted dialogue an overwrought plot with a squirm-inducing revelation far too weighty for the froth of a romantic comedy -- and a seriously obnoxious heroine. Its not Kats (or Messings) fault that shes obnoxious. Shes just drawn that way. Heres a woman whos clearly on the far side of 30 a grown woman who can obviously afford Nicks 6000 weekend tab but she persists in acting like shes barely out of her teens yet another entry in a long line of stereotypical screeching singletons populating romantic comedies these days. (Yes Renee Zellweger aka Bridget Jones were talking to you.) Somewhere along the way studio suits decided that a romantic heroine had to be lovable which she does but that to be lovable she had to be a complete mess (which she doesnt). This notion is rooted in the success of the adorably wacky heroines who were once the oeuvre of Meg Ryan from ""When Harry Met Sally"" to ""Sleepless in Seattle."" Ryan did cute and neurotic better than anyone. But beneath the neurosis was a certain amount of strength not to mention sex appeal. Her characters might find solace alphabetizing their video collections but she always played a woman comfortable with her own sexuality. In other words a grown-up. Kat on the other hand acts like a woman whos never seen herself naked let alone a man. Nick steps out of the shower and Kat is unexpectedly -- and literally -- faced with his naughty bits. Shes instantly reduced to a seventh-grader all over-the-top stammering and broad comic mugging. This is a gag that couldve worked in say ""13 Going on 30"" or perhaps in director Kilners earlier effort the teen flick ""How to Deal."" But how much more effective if Kat had instead channeled Samantha or Carrie from ""Sex and the City"" with a clever quip designed to take a man down to size so to speak. But the clever quips are in short supply here. There are attempts at quippyness as when Kat warns Nick early on ""You know those families that are crazy but by the end of the day you love them because theyre family? Thats not my family."" Too bad the family never lives up to the as-advertised madcap dysfunctionalism. But mostly we have platitudes served up with plodding regularity by Nick ""I think Id miss you even if I never met you"" and ""The hardest thing in loving someone is letting them love you back."" No the hardest thing is watching Mulroney and Messing try to feign any kind of chemistry. Mulroneys too busy being saddled with the perfect man cliche and Messings too busy acting scattered and wounded for the two ever to interact and ignite. Dont bother asking how an Ivy League guy would end up hooking. Such a query could only lead to some dark answers answers that the filmmakers have no interest in dealing with but which would make for a much more interesting movie than ""The Wedding Date"" coming at you just in time for date-movie season could ever hope to be. The Wedding Date (89 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sexual situations.

Need a date? Hire a professional. 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Wedding Date Comedy. Starring Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney. Directed by Clare Kilner. (PG-13. 85 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The Wedding Date"" is a routine romantic comedy with no surprises the type of film theyve been making forever Always watchable never exactly good. The only real question is whether the stars Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney are pleasing to watch. They are. So thats one way to be interested in ""The Wedding Date"" as a vehicle for Debra Messing whos like Sandra Bullock without the dark side and Dermot Mulroney who often plays eccentrics but proves himself here as a brooding handsome leading man. He plays a ""professional male escort"" she hires as her date to her sisters wedding. Shes reeling from a breakup and needs an edge going in. Pretty as Messing is she makes the heroine neurotic enough that its actually believable she might have trouble finding a date. Another way to be interested in ""The Wedding Date"" is as a sample romantic comedy from 2005. Because everyone has passionate opinions about love and sex romantic comedies have always had to play it safe and try to please everybody. Audiences dont go to romantic comedies to be challenged but rather to have their mores and misconceptions reinforced. Thats why such films seem so strange years later -- romantic comedies from the 1960s look like something from Neptune -- and yet why conversely theyre so interesting Romantic comedies encapsulate an eras baseline attitudes about love and sexuality. In ""The Wedding Date"" Kat (Messing) is presented as a nervous lovable self-effacing neurotic someone almost innocent. And yet midway through the movie she gets roaring drunk and comes home wakes up her paid professional escort and has passionate sex with him on a houseboat. What does it all mean? That such a thing could happen in a movie like this means that not only young people think this behavior is OK. It means Granny thinks its OK too. It means America thinks its OK. You know that farm couple with the pitchfork in the Grant Wood painting? They got no problem with it either. Bottom line To take the moral temperature of America dont look at the risque films. Look at whats supposedly innocuous. Those ruminations aside ""The Wedding Date"" is a fairly mediocre film not nearly as funny as it should be nor as heartfelt. On the plus side its only 85 minutes long and isnt boring. On the downside it has an intrusive pop soundtrack and a screenplay full of fake conflicts. The movie benefits from the easy interaction of Messing and Mulroney and also from the setting. Though Kat is American her family lives in England and so the picture takes place partly in London and partly in the English countryside. From the audiences standpoint this extended wedding celebration -- including games get-togethers bachelor and bachelorette parties a rehearsal dinner and a reception -- looks like a welcome invitation. -- Advisory This film contains lewd explicit adult conversation about sexuality and one sex scene.

In The Wedding Date a tense New Yorker (Debra Messing) pilfers her 401(k) of 6000 so she can hire an A-list male escort (Dermot Mulroney) to accompany her back home to her half-sisters wedding in London -- all to make the ex-fiance who dumped her jealous. For hire Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney. Universal Studios Given Mulroneys well-known penchant for lockjawed dialogue deliveries you have to wish she had spent her money more wisely. But his character is the only A-list component of this pitiful little feel-good comedy with seamy underpinnings. This guy gets the six grand just for showing up; sexual services cost more. (Related video Watch the Wedding Date trailer) The movie goes wrong from the start by simply throwing us into the action and asking us to identify with Messings desperate scheme. Hiring a gigolo wouldnt be something shed want to come up in say her confirmation hearing for secretary of state. About the movie The Wedding Date  1/2 (out of four) Stars Debra Messing Dermot Mulroney Amy Adams Jack Davenport Sarah Parish Director Clare Kilner Distributor Universal Rated PG-13 for sexual content including dialogue Opens Friday nationwide Director Clare Kilner (Mandy Moores How to Deal) has problems throughout figuring how to play this sunny/gloomy story. The parents are sweet but the sister has her own dark past. The ex probably needs professional help but his psychological rot is played for laughs. And Mulroney doesnt show much emotion at all. Messing has the vulnerability for the role but she doesnt get any help and its painful to watch her flail. In fact its hard to see how anyone even agreed to sign on for the picture. There must have been the promise of a really tangy wine vintage in the final reception scene. Throughout it all we hear clunky echoes of Four Weddings and a Funeral. For this grim comedy dirges will likely be playing when the box office grosses are reported.

Studio romantic comedies (not counting the classics of yesteryear starring Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy or Cary Grant and Irene Dunne) are hardly known for their brilliance these days. But this one starring Dermot Mulroney (or is it Dylan McDermott? You guys confuse me) and Debra Messing (aka TVs Grace to Eric McCormacks Will) has its own special brand of energetic vapidity. Never did a movie act like it was romantic and magical with less evidence. Money will buy her love Kat Ellis (Debra Messing) falls in love with her hired escort Nick Mercer (Dermot Mulroney) in ""The Wedding Date."" (Eugene Adebari -- Universal Studios) _____More in Movies_____  Wedding Date Reviews and Showtimes  Watch the Trailer  More Movie Trailers  Current Movie Openings  Oscars Coverage  Arts amp; Living Movies _____Desson Thomson_____  More Reviews  Live Online Behind the Screen  Arts amp; Living Movies Free E-mail Newsletters Washington Entertainment GuideSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now MoviesSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now TravelSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now At HomeSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now Director Clare Kilner and first-time hack Dana Fox hustle down the well-trod aisle of all those wedding movies (from ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" to ""My Best Friends Wedding"") like replicant brides. They understand the machinations of the ceremony but have no clue that romance is supposed to be the special spark between two alluring and charismatic people. This movie is all pretty faces and six-pack abs but no characters. All surface and no soul. Come to think of it the surface isnt so darned hot either. As I understand the ""plot"" it goes something like this. Kat Ellis (Messing) has been invited to her half sisters wedding in London. (Why London? Why to make us all think of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral."") But she learns her ex-fiance Jeffrey (Jeremy Sheffield) is going to the best man. That means Kat and Jeffrey will be rubbing shoulders during the whole stag/hen festivities pre-ceremony dinner thing. Determined to look as though she is doing fine thank you she hires a top-of-the-line male escort (Dylmot McMulligan or whatever) named Nick to parade around with her. Being a one-dimensional creation Nick is a stud who has lost the ability to truly love. And Kat who suffers a similar lack of dimension has self-esteem issues. Nick knows how to make her feel good. Kat teaches him to care. If you can count from one to two you should be able to do the math. ""The Wedding Date"" whose only saving grace is that its over in under 90 minutes has a twist. At least its supposed to be one. And it throws Kat into the kind of torment that only Ingmar Bergman could outdo Oh she did not do that behind your back And with him Oh the horror The tears Cue insipid music on the soundtrack Finally Kat realizes the truth that has been sitting right in front of her all along This is a terrible movie and the best thing to do is smile and look happy until the credits pull the merciful curtain across the screen. Okay so that last part was my interpretation. Guess its just my desperate way of begging Hollywood to please please resist the temptation to make ""The Wedding Date 2."" THE WEDDING DATE (PG-13 89 minutes) -- Contains sexual situations and dramatic pablum. Area theaters.

See next articles See previous articles Site Navigation Site Mobile Navigation Advertisement Supported by Movies | FILM REVIEW A Pretty Woman Scenario With the Roles Reversed By ANITA GATESFEB. 4 2005 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story I am willing to bet money that the director Clare Kilner adored ""Four Weddings and a Funeral."" Either she or Dana Fox a screenwriter must have a serious soft spot for that movie because their new romantic comedy ""The Wedding Date"" struggles from beginning to end to capture the charm and ebullience of ""Four Weddings"" Mike Newells 1994 film about bad timing and a British-American romance. The new movies effort is mostly unsuccessful but there are bright spots.Debra Messing stars as Kat Ellis a good-looking New Yorker with half a dozen pieces of good-looking matched luggage whose younger half sister has the nerve to be marrying first. The ceremony is in London where their blended British-American family lives and the grooms best man is Kats former fiance who broke off the engagement. (The exposition begins immediately with the heroine sharing information with the bicycle messenger at her door.) Naturally Kat has to show up with some fabulous guy and since there is no such man in her life she turns to the classified ads for ""male escorts.""Now the film turns into a gender-reversed ""Pretty Woman."" That film posited the notion that a businessman might hire a Los Angeles streetwalker with the looks charm and self-possession of Julia Roberts. ""The Wedding Date"" suggests that a woman could pick a male prostitute out of a newspaper ad and have him turn out to be a hunk with beautiful manners and a degree in comparative literature from Brown University. Seriously.I missed the part where Dermot Mulroney became a sex symbol (in ""My Best Friends Wedding"" it was never clear why either Ms. Roberts or Cameron Diaz wanted him so much) but as Nick Mercer one of those film characters who know everything and are never flustered or unsure he is highly appealing. This cant be easy because he is given ridiculous behavior like the aggressive parading-around-naked-in-the-bathroom scene (although the 6000 Kat paid him from her 401-K does not include sex) and aphorisms that dont quite deliver. ""Look people in the eye"" Nick tells Kat. ""Theyll never know what youre wearing.""Ms. Messing best known as the increasingly wacky interior designer Grace Adler in NBCs sitcom ""Will and Grace"" manages to keep her dignity too sometimes by deliberately losing it. When she wakes up on the plane at the end of the flight to London she actually looks like someone who has slept all night fitfully in an airline seat. Advertisement Continue reading the main story During most of the film though she is striking glamorous and beautifully dressed like the rest of the cast. Holland Taylor who has carved out a film and television niche as the quintessential affluent mom of a certain age is appealingly brittle as Kats mother. Sarah Parish as T.J. a British cousin fills the role of the humorously blunt relative nicely. As Amy the self-involved blond bride Amy Adams is suitably unlikable prone to icky comments like ""Youre my half sister but I whole love you."" Her groom (Jack Davenport) and Kats ex-fiance (Jeremy Sheffield) dont have much to do until the big happiness-threatening secret is revealed near the end.The scenery is equally good-looking. After the rowdy bachelor and bachelorette parties in London everyone heads for the glorious English countryside for family-bonding activities most notably an amateur game of rounders; solemn plot-advancing talks inside a boathouse beside a poetry-worthy lake; and the actual wedding at the perfect old country church. ""The Wedding Date"" proves that there is nothing inherently magical about a group of adults frolicking on a lawn with an old pop-music hit in the background. But the various scenes charms would be far more enjoyable if the movie werent so in love with its own supposed cuteness.""The Wedding Date"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has four-letter words sexual discussions and situations brief partial nudity and an innocuous attempt at a fistfight.The Wedding Date Opens today nationwide.Directed by Clare Kilner; written by Dana Fox based on the book ""Asking for Trouble"" by Elizabeth Young; director of photography Oliver Curtis; edited by Mary Finlay; music by Blake Neely; production designer Tom Burton; produced by Nathalie Marciano Michelle Chydzik Sowa Jessica Bendinger and Paul Brooks; released by Universal Pictures. Running time 90 minutes. This film is rated PG-13.WITH Debra Messing (Kat Ellis) Dermot Mulroney (Nick Mercer) Amy Adams (Amy) Jack Davenport (Edward Fletcher-Wooten) Sarah Parish (T.J.) Jeremy Sheffield (Jeffrey) Peter Egan (Victor Ellis) and Holland Taylor (Bunny). Continue reading the main story Were interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.

So many body parts from other engineered romantic comedies have been crudely harvested and stitched together in the making of this weird robotic lark that Maid of Honor of Frankenstein might be more useful a nickname. From Pretty Woman comes the popularly hypocritical middle-American fantasy of a hooker-who-looks-like-a-movie-star with Mulroney suave in a tuxedo and (as the camera leers at his butt) even suaver in the altogether as a man who rents himself out to ladies in need. In this case the employer is Messings Kat who dreads showing up solo at the wedding of her princessy half-sister Amy (Amy Adams) especially since Kats caddish ex-beau (Jeremy Sheffield) is the best man. From Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill theres the jolly phony-as-Madonnas-accent Anglophilia created by American first-time screenwriter Dana Fox and British director Clare Kilner. In this instance frightfully sophisticated and ch-ch-charming Brits (i.e. Amys dim but gentlemanly intended and his mates) embrace their Yank counterparts for games of cricket pub crawling and parties held in country houses out of Howards End. From Maid in Manhattan with its stultifying lack of chemistry between Ralph Fiennes and Jennifer Lopez comes the fizzle between Mulroney and Messing -- the former a relaxed movie actor (himself filched from My Best Friends Wedding) whose rugged masculinity fails to relax Messings usually more delightful tightly wound persona. The Wedding Date proceeds as prescripted as marriage vows; the studio-sealed happy ending is in sight from the first frame. And even though the comedy flirts with modern gender reversal -- Kat is the buyer Nick is the goods -- the movies numbingly conventional mind-set is also never in doubt Having purchased the pleasure of his company like a grown sexual woman Kat becomes a giggly little girl in a flannel nightie when it comes time for bed and the possibility of S-E-X. At least Richard Gere knew what to do with Julia Roberts when Edward met Vivian. Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.
