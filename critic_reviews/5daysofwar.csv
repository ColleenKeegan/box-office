Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 26 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Aug. 25 2011 559PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Renny Harlin the Finnish director who made such films as Die Hard 2 and Cliffhanger in the early nineties was the Michael Bay of his time - an action director with a reputation for filling studios coffers by filling movie screens with flying vehicles and fire bombs. Then came his pirate movie Cutthroat Island (1995) starring his then-wife Geena Davis which Guinness World Records still lists as the biggest movie flop of all time earning about 10-million domestically against a 98-million budget. After a decade where he has toiled mostly in the horror genre his new movie 5 Days of War about the Russian-Georgian crisis of 2008 is Harlins return to the action movie. This time its a meaningful action flick along the line of Body of Lies Blood Diamond or Green Zone. The message of 5 Days of War is hard to miss Made with the Georgian governments support the movie is about the persecution of Georgia by the Russians. In a prelude set in Iraq in 2007 a carload of journalists is ambushed. American TV reporter Thomas Anders (Rupert Friend of Pride amp; Prejudice) watches his girlfriend and fellow reporter die. He is rescued by a Georgian commander Captain Rezo (Johnathon Schaech) fighting with the coalition forces.  A year later Thomas gets word of a developing conflict in Georgia where tensions between Georgia and Russia are coming to a head over the breakaway Georgian state of South Ossetia which Moscow supports. Thomas heads to Georgia with his friend and camera man Sebastian (Richard Coyle). After witnessing a wedding party attacked by Russian war planes the journalists set out along with a Georgian schoolteacher named Tatia (Emmanuelle Chriqui of Entourage fame) into the battle zone to find her missing family. After Sebastian secretly videotapes a brutal civilian execution they hide a memory card with the footage on it before they are captured and imprisoned. The rest of the film concerns their attempts with the help of Captain Rezo again to get the footage out to the Western media. In the otherwise thriller-by-numbers script with a hodgepodge of international actors assuming various ethnic identities (stars Val Kilmer and Heather Graham essentially do cameos) 5 Days of War feels low-budget in everything except its battle sequences featuring collapsing buildings somersaulting cars and screaming fighter jets all on a 12-million (U.S.) budget. The Georgian army of course provided the troops and hardware. Not surprisingly Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili (Andy Garcia talking in accented English) is portrayed as a peace-loving hero struggling to avoid military action. Meanwhile his enemies the Russians and South Ossetian militia bomb civilians terrify grandmothers and slash throats. The film ends with a line of real-life Georgians each telling the camera about the horrors they experienced and witnessed. As grim as these accounts are the exercise is designed to stoke outrage. According to Human Rights Watch both sides were guilty of needlessly causing civilian deaths including the use of cluster bombs. Anna Neistat an executive with the organization who helped write a report on the conflict told The New York Times she considered the film ""extremely dangerous"" in portraying Russians and Ossetians as ""barbaric beasts and Georgians as peace angels."" Harlins film begins with the familiar adage that truth is the first casualty of war. Usually that phrase precedes an attempt to revive the patient not bury it deeper in the rubble of propaganda. 5 Days of War Directed by Renny Harlin Written by Mikko Alanne and David Battle Starring Rupert Friend Richard Coyle and Emmanuelle Chriqui Report Typo/Error Follow Liam Lacey on Twitter liamlacey Comments AA In the know Report on Business In tough job market highly educated feel the squeeze Report on Pokemon Canadians love it a Pokemaster is crowned Werner Herzog is puzzled News How a Dudes Club in Vancouver is helping homeless men feel human again Life How do I keep peace in the family when money comes up?

TWITTER Rupert Friend Richard Coyle and Emmanuelle Chriqui star in director Renny Harlins dramatization of the Russia/Georgia conflict. NEW YORK -- Historical propaganda by way of action-flick bombast 5 Days of War purports to focus on the self-sacrifice of war correspondents but is really a clunky effort to rewrite 2008s brief Russia/Georgia conflict in black and white terms. Director Renny Harlin applies the subtle sensibility of Die Hard 2 to the tale of journos dodging gunfire to get ""the truth"" to the public; Salvador it aint. Box office prospects are dim with audiences lacking a vested interest in the subject. The producers including a Georgian company with access to government palaces and military hardware appear to believe that recruiting Hollywood faces would help get their message heard in foreign lands. But Georgias GDP is about a hundredth of its rivals Where Russia might have recruited A-listers this version of the drama suffers from a largely past-its-prime cast and crew. Most awkward here is Andy Garcia struggling beneath an unplaceable accent as Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili. But the movies focus is out in South Ossetian villages where combat-numbed reporter Thomas (Rupert Friend) and his cameraman Sebastian (Richard Coyle) have just stumbled across an atrocity committed by invading Russian troops. Having filmed the slaughter of a wedding party they must hang onto the cameras memory card long enough to convince Western news agencies to broadcast it. If the problem (not borne out by actual newscasts at the time) is that Americans refused to look at Georgian troubles Harlins solution is to present them using all the hackneyed devices U.S. moviegoers have been paying to watch for decades Here fireballs send cars tumbling through the air slow-motion massacres are paired with heavy-handed scores and the two warring sides -- chiseled Georgian soldiers fighting tattooed grubby Russian rogues -- might as well be wearing white and black cowboy hats. A couple of the films action beats like a last-minute rescue in which Georgians smash through the window on rappelling ropes may actually prompt laughter in the theater but even moments that arent unintentionally comic demean real-life suffering with shallow bombast. An unconvincing human-interest subplot has Thomas protecting massacre survivor Tatia (Emmanuelle Chriqui). Thomas is supposed to be haunted by the death of an old lover (Heather Graham appearing in flashback just long enough to get shot) but Friends performance is more flat than wounded and viewers may cringe at cues that the movie intends to wring romance out of his encounter with Tatia. Failing romance theyll have to be satisfied with relationships between reporters and photographers (including Val Kilmer whose character has eaten too many press-lounge bagels) who may have their cynical banter down pat but rarely exhibit the kind of inquisitive and dogged intelligence it takes to survive in a war zone.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet While as an action movie 5 Days Of War is rote and cliche-riddled as an act of pop-culture warfare its downright fascinating an answering salvo in a battle thats moved from the disputed Caucasus territory of South Ossetia into the realm of schlocky feature films. A few months after 2008s Russo-Georgian War Russia released a documentary online purporting to tell the suppressed truth about Georgias culpability in the conflict. It was followed by the made-for-Russian-TV drama Olympus Inferno a love story involving a visiting American biologist who gets caught up in whats again shown as the Georgian army running rampant. 5 Days Of War is Georgias return volley owing its initial funding to the Georgian government and listing a state minister as a producer. The film ups the stakes impressively with a larger budget and only slightly dented Hollywood offerings--Renny Harlin still one of the all-time top-grossing directors though long past his Die Hard 2 heyday; Rupert Friend as a dashing war reporter; Emmanuelle Chriqui as his local love interest/thing to rescue; an oddly cast but earnest Andy Garcia as the Georgian president; and Val Kilmer nibbling scenery as a seen-it-all veteran correspondent. Accents abound unevenly--Garcia sports one Chriqui doesnt bother. The dialogue trips over unwieldy exposition about a complicated situation before settling into a comfier divide of good and evil in which the Georgian soldiers are heroic and led by Johnathon Schaech and the Russians by Rade Serbedzija (the hey-its-that-guy of ominous Eastern Europeans) and a tattooed Cossack who slits the throats of elderly ladies. The plot involves Friend and friends getting footage of said throat-slitting and attempting to find a place to upload it while running from attacks and explosions--a goal that when finally achieved is anticlimactically noted to be getting a lot of hits at Human Rights Watch which hardly seems to justify the dangerous effort. The combat at least looks good--the military equipment was reportedly provided by Georgias defense ministry. But the film is far more interested in its underdeveloped fictional characters than in giving any sense of the scope of or motivations behind the war which is shown from such a one-sided angle that it seems nonsensical. As propaganda 5 Days Of War is unlikely to make a mark though perhaps the idea of reaching people through would-be blockbusters will. As the film shows when the conflict first broke out in South Ossetia everyone was too busy covering the Olympic opening ceremony in Beijing to pay it much mind. Spectacle rules the day.

Starring Rupert Friend Val Kilmer Andy garcia Dean Cain Emmanuelle Chriqui Heather Graham Mikko Nousianen Richard Coyle Antje Traue Rade Serbedzija Director Renny Harlin Running time 153 Release Opened Aug 19 2011  Editorial Review Tanks but no tanksBy John DeForeFriday Aug 19 2011A tired old quote about truth being the first casualty of war is a strange way to start ""5 Days of War"" an overwrought drama that whatever its good intentions could hardly be said to aim for objectivity in its account of the 2008 conflict between Russia and Georgia. Directed by Renny Harlin whose career has fallen far from its action-flick peak of ""Die Hard 2"" and ""Cliffhanger"" the film is the single production of Georgia International Films a company that arranged the loan of government buildings and munitions for shooting. Unsurprisingly given its origins no ""fog of war"" exists here just brave Georgian soldiers and helpless citizens facing Russians whose rogue tattooed gunmen happily shoot grandmothers without provocation. We see these atrocities through the eyes of Thomas a correspondent who (with his cameraman Sebastian) gets a massacre on tape and spends the film trying to persuade apathetic American networks to run the story. Rupert Friend maintains his dignity as Thomas but hes never very credible; though we see him swap combat yarns with fellow journalists he just doesnt project the intelligence and curiosity the job demands. He spends much more time looking haunted by the death of an old girlfriend a loss the script dwells on in hopes of lending depth to Thomass encounter with Tatia a Georgian he hopes to keep safe through the invasion. Harlins roots show throughout the picture as he films real-life horrors with a bombast better suited to summer entertainment. Cars explode and somersault through the air; victims contort into crucifixion poses as they are riddled with bullets; action slows down and goes silent so a heavy-handed score can work its magic. Cliches abound from ""save yourself"" martyrdom to a scene of hero and villain playing chess while the latter waxes philosophical about combat. Andy Garcia affecting a deeply unconvincing accent portrays Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili a bit of casting only slightly odder than hiring Heather Graham to appear in the first few minutes before being killed in an ambush. The film is littered with washed-up stars in fact presumably cast because the producers thought their message would reach Americans only if they could get some famous people involved. Sadly that may be true in this case. But ""5 Days of War"" suffers all the failings of Hollywoodization without capturing the compelling pathos its subject deserves.Contains strong bloody war violence and atrocities and pervasive language.

(Handout) BY Joe Neumaier DAILY NEWS MOVIE CRITIC Friday August 19 2011 400 AM AMIGO - 4 starsU.S. troops try to win the hearts and minds of a Filipino village in 1900 (204). Not rated Violence. At Empire 25.The latest from director John Sayles is an engrossing perceptive supremely humane drama about imperialism and loyalty. In 1900 during the Philippine-American war a U.S garrison led by a gruff colonel (Chris Cooper) occupying a Filipino village attempts to tamp down local guerrillas while the barrio mayor (Joel Torre) and a priest reluctantly assist. Just as the soldiers come to know the rhythms of the village Sayles brings us into touch with every character including the Chinese laborers whose  presence reflects a cross-cultural layering. Cooper Torre and Dane DeHaan as a soldier smitten with a local girl stand out among a strong cast. With its big ideas on an intimate scale this is Sayles best in a decade.5 DAYS OF WAR - zero stars Journalists face dangers during the Russian-Georgian war (153). R Violence. At the Angelika.A hack job from director Renny Harlin (""Die Hard 2"" ""Cutthroat Island"") that fails as both a drama about combat journalists facing mortal danger and as a war actioner set during the brief battle between Russia and the Republic of Georgia in 2008. Rupert Friend is bland as a reporter struggling to get a memory disk out so he can show the world the truth hes seeing -- which includes B-movie-style thugs threatening his cameraman pal (Richard Coyle). Val Kilmer drifts in as a hedonistic Dutch photographer and Emmanuelle Chriqui (""Entourage"") is miscast as a desperate Georgian schoolteacher. Harlin even makes poor Kilmer go running about. Just like that image ""5 Days"" is embarrassingly clumsy.PROGRAMMING THE NATION? THE HISTORY OF SUBLIMINAL MESSAGING IN AMERICA - 3 stars Documentary about theories of secret suggestions in media (145). Not rated. At the Quad. This thought-provoking but overlong doc wins points for being all-inclusive. Director Jeff Warrick a former ad exec uncovers layers both real and imagined in politics marketing radio and even stores (are there voices in the Muzak?). A section on magazine images alone is like a Rorschach test in Freudian imagery. But Warricks tries at being confrontational fall flat and many interviewees seem to waffle. Worth a viewing if it pops up on TV -- the right medium for these messages.THE LAST CIRCUS - 3 starsA clown goes on a rampage. (145). Not rated Sexuality violence. At Cinema Village. In Spanish with English subtitles.Take Fellini Tarantino and ""Taxi Driver"" throw em in a cage with a lion and youd get this strange wild trip. In 1937 Spain a boys father works as a clown before being forced by Francos army to kill rebels. Javier grows up to follow in his dads footsteps but in the 70s working for an abusive fellow clown he becomes unhinged. Before going off in conventional directions ""Circus"" is terrifically weird funny and garish.

This obscure offshoot of the better-known Chechen war was all but ignored by the rest of the world because it coincided with the Summer Olympics in Beijing. Its totally unclear from the movie why Russia joins with the separatist governments of South Ossetia and Abkhazia in this murky armed conflict -- but Georgias president portrayed by a scenery-chewing Andy Garcia repeatedly assures us that Russia is unilaterally to blame. Harlin focuses on a cliche-riddled story about an American journalist (a Brit Rupert Friend trying out his best Tom Cruise accent) and his British mate (Richard Coyle). Theyre struggling to smuggle a video showing Russian atrocities past a ruthless Russki colonel (Rade Sherbedgia) and his barbaric mercenary (Mikko Nousiainen) with the help of a comely Georgian schoolteacher (Emmanuelle Chriqui). ""5 Days of War"" which features an extended cameo by Val Kilmer and a much briefer one by Heather Graham as other war correspondents should appeal more to those who like to watch stuff blow up than understand exactly why the carnage is transpiring.

The public seems to be sick to death of war movies especially when theyre as much of a mixed bag as ""5 Days of War"" a hell-on-earth thriller that makes valiant gestures toward geopolitical savvy but gets bushwhacked by vet helmer Renny Harlins weakness for the Rambo-esque. Set during the brief brutal 2008 flare-up between Russia and Georgia the drama has some exhilarating moments but theyre dampened by concessions to conventionally bloviating music overly theatrical dialogue and inadvertently comic slo-mo. Well-known faces notably those of Val Kilmer and Andy Garcia probably wont help the campaign. It would be ironic if the Anchor Bay release does slip through the cracks because of its political content given the central message of Mikko Alanne and David Battles screenplay. As war reporter Thomas Anders (Rupert Friend) and his cameraman Sebastian Ganz (Richard Coyle) skirt disaster after disaster they face the difficulties of not only getting news but disseminating it In 2008 were reminded the global media were too preoccupied with the Olympics to care that independent Georgia was being brutalized by Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. As Thomas and Sebastian put their life on the line capturing the atrocities being committed by Cossack mercenaries against civilians the worlds response is something like a yawn. The adventure in Georgia is prefaced by a short sequence set in 2007 Iraq. There Thomas Sebastian and their colleague Miriam (an oddly cast Heather Graham) who also happens to be Thomas love interest are ambushed by terrorists; Miriam is shot dead (the film notes that more than 500 war journalists have been killed in the last decade). Almost the entire scene is captured through Sebastians camera raising the concern that ""5 Days of War"" is going to be a viewfinder movie. This worry proves unfounded; the action here like most of the mayhem once the story reaches war-torn Georgia is visceral and immediate. While he displays the same kinetic compulsion of his early studio work (""Die Hard 2"" ""Cutthroat Island"" ""Cliffhanger"") Harlin also is trying to craft a character study and a political critique and the various sides of the movie dont always mesh. Sebastian Thomas (whos carrying a load of guilt about Miriam) and the other members of their loosely knit community of combat reporters -- including a character known as the Dutchman (Kilmer) who goes around saying things like ""This place is about to blow man"" -- are motivated by profit and fame. They all want a story thats going to go global and they think they have one initially at least in Georgia. But cynical callous newspeople wouldnt be enough for a movie which is why Thomas has a conscious a calling and eventually another love interest Tatia (Emmanuelle Chriqui) a Georgian educated in New York (hence the lack of accent) whose sisters wedding is attacked by Russian jet fighters. Her surviving family members become the central figures in the story Thomas risks his life to tell. With Kathryn Bigelows ""The Hurt Locker"" and other films that have straddled the hybrid docu-feature approach to our various Mideast calamities auds have come to expect a stripped-down authenticity in war films. Thats one reason why ""5 Days of War"" seems so tone deaf Garcia does in fact look like Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili but the thesp is such a well-known quantity that the casting seems like a stunt; ditto Johnathon Schaech who shows up as a heroic Georgian soldier. Chriqui is a fine actress but an unconvincing Georgian. For that matter Friend seems a bit of a callow youth for a guy whos supposed to be battle-hardened and war-weary; Coyle pulls off that particular bit far better. ""5 Days of War"" is a movie with its heart in the right place but a fatal taste for cheese Every time it has you by the nerve endings it does something -- a slo-mo death a sappily sentimental line an ill-timed strain of Trevor Rabins too obvious score -- to let you go. Production values are generally good particularly some spectacular work by d.p. Checco Varese but they simply arent used to best effect. 5 Days of WarU.S.-Georgia ProductionAn Anchor Bay Films release presented with RexMedia of a GIF/Midnight Sun Pictures/RexMedia production.

Nakanimamasakhlisi/Anchor Bay Films hide caption toggle caption Nakanimamasakhlisi/Anchor Bay Films 5 Days Of War Director Renny Harlin Genre Drama Running Time 113 minutes Rated R for strong bloody war violence and atrocities and for pervasive language With Rupert Friend Emmanuelle Chriqui Val Kilmer Andy Garcia Heather Graham Watch Clips New Beginning New Beginning Credit Anchor Bay Films Do Something Do Something Credit Anchor Bay Films Will Not Intervene Will Not Intervene Credit Anchor Bay Films Drawing on both his action-flick chops and his family background Die Hard 2 director Renny Harlin battles his way back from straight-to-video purgatory with 5 Days of War. The low-budget movie set during Russias 2008 invasion of Georgia is neither innovative nor profound but it is kinetic visceral and sometimes moving. The story is largely based on eyewitness accounts collected by Human Rights Watch and is best when it stays close to these anecdotes. Children and the elderly are callously targeted in the sort of wartime atrocities that have become something of a specialty for screenwriter Mikko Alanne. Alanne -- like Harlin a Finn -- also wrote Pinkville Oliver Stones upcoming film about the My Lai massacre. Yet amid the contemporary horrors 5 Days of War finds room for some classic-Hollywood developments inventing an improbable battlefield romance and a moment where an implacable enemy calls a personal truce. Also conspicuously old-fashioned are the several symbolic appearances of St. George Georgias namesake and the patron saint of evil-battlers. After a traumatic prologue set in Iraq another of 2008s least inviting locales the movie trails five war correspondents to Georgia. The best-known actor in the bunch is Val Kilmer but hes a minor player. The central characters are reporter Thomas Anders (Rupert Friend) and his camera-toting colleague Sebastian Ganz (Richard Coyle). Anders who has already experienced plenty of loss is soon smitten with Tatia Medoevi (Emmanuelle Chriqui) a pretty young teacher he attempts to safeguard after her sisters wedding turns as bloody as Harlins A Nightmare on Elm Street 4. Aside from protecting Tatia and her family Thomas priority is finding an outlet for Ganzs video of summary executions and other war crimes. But the Beijing Olympics have just begun and most of the major Western news outlets are not interested. The Russians and their local allies independence-seeking Ossetians dont share CNNs indifference. Col. Demidov (Rade Serbedzija) desperately wants the memory card containing the video footage and much of the plot involves games of keep-away with the tiny card. The worst of Demidovs troops is a ruthless terminator who calls himself a ""Cossack"" and might as well be a cyborg. Yet several times a Russian shows compassion for Georgian noncombatants. i Georgian teacher Tatia (Emmanuelle Chriqui) becomes embroiled in the journalists world -- and more specifically in the world of Thomas love life -- after violence erupts at her sisters wedding. Nakanimamasakhlisi/Anchor Bay Films hide caption toggle caption Nakanimamasakhlisi/Anchor Bay Films Georgian teacher Tatia (Emmanuelle Chriqui) becomes embroiled in the journalists world -- and more specifically in the world of Thomas love life -- after violence erupts at her sisters wedding. Nakanimamasakhlisi/Anchor Bay Films Thats not enough to make a balanced account. The movie focuses on Georgian suffering and provides neither a larger context nor scenes in which Georgians butcher Ossetians (as they reportedly have). Thats partially because the story is narrowly focused but also because the filmmakers sympathies are clearly with Georgia. The movie was conceived and financed by Georgian businessmen and received substantial assistance from the Georgian military. Growing up in Russia-wary Finland Harlin heard first-person stories of his countrys 1939-40 Winter War with the Soviet Union. The director even cast Andy Garcia a Cuban exile who directed the anti-Castro The Lost City to play Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili. In other words the movie has an agenda. Two in fact Calling attention to Georgias 2008 plight and making that calamity into a gripping if conventional adventure movie with jerky pans quick cuts and a score that shifts between mournful classical-style piano and agitated hard-rock guitar. Ultimately Harlins Hollywood training upstages his Finnish outrage. He has admitted to being unable to stage scenes as gruesome as real-life video of the war hes seen but the movies atrocity scenes are harrowing enough to make the point. 5 Days of War is not the definitive comment on the Russia-Georgia conflict but it does bring the war part of the way home.

Emotionally scarred from an earlier gig in Iraq Thomas has attachment issues--until that is the pulchritudinous Tatia (Emmanuelle Chriqui who doesnt bother to fake a Georgian accent) shows up to teach him a thing or two about commitment. Self-actualization out of the way our heroes head to the front to surreptitiously film Russian atrocities and attempt to get the footage out to a world that tragically couldnt care less. Director Renny Harlin cant resist getting his Rambo on even for so grave a subject and although hes masterful with running gun battles and tense helicopter showdowns such scenes all but snuff out the spark in Mikko Alanne and David Battles screenplay. (Bizarre bit parts by Val Kilmer and Andy Garcia also distract.) Nevertheless taking the vantage point of civilians rather than combatants allows 5 Days of War to show the toll of the terror and of the relentless exhausting pursuit of war with unexpected force. Had it rejected the genres romantic trappings and false heroics more consistently the movie mightve been worth the ride.
