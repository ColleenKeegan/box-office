Of course we do. He worked up something strange and lovely for this character in the first Pirates of the Caribbean three years ago and hes deliriously at it again in the new sequel subtitled Dead Mans Chest. It is not just a matter of his eye makeup or his funny way of walking running or (sometimes) sitting still -- as when he discovers to his dismay that the cannibals have decided to make him the centerpiece of their banquet. It goes deeper than that Jack is a modernist unaccountably obliged to the mindless heroics not only of an antique movie genre but to the whole ethos of an era when everyone heedlessly advances into action swords drawn instead of more sensibly retreating into their studies to think things over when danger threatens. Jack frankly is an anachronism. A lot of his dialogue could be comfortably fitted into a contemporary Owen Wilson romantic farce and a lot of his more muscular activities are desperate existential improvisations. Depp lets us see his mental gears whirring (and very often clanking) before he takes action that in some way subverts everyones expectations. You might say that hes the anti-Errol Flynn. The context of both Pirates movies aims for similar subversions. You will recall that in the first film the bad pirates that abducted the governors daughter (Kiera Knightly) turned out to be representatives of the undead which involved her swain (Orlando Bloom) and Jack with a lot of special-effects figures (they turned into skeletons when night fell). This was I thought a drag but it was rendered tolerable by the wit and originality of Depps performance. This time the plot device is quite similar The eponymous chest contains something that will return Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) king of the underseas underworld and yes captain of the The Flying Dutchman no less to the land of the fully living. But Davy is half octopus half man and his crew seems to have been recruited from the Star Wars cantina of yore though they have even worse skin problems and are covered with the kind of slime that has recently become fashionable among the villains in fantasy films. They are not very menacing or scary and neither are the threats they pose to Jack and his pals. Theres also a whole thing with a giant squid that may put such ancients who attend the senior matinees in mind of Cecil B. DeMilles Reap the Wild Wind (1942). And that says nothing of the water wheel that comes loose from its mooring at an old mill and rumbles across the countryside quite like the ferris wheel that rolled out of an amusement park in Steven Spielbergs 1941 to similarly mirthless effect. These are ripoffs not homages but they are also emblematic of a movie that is essentially a special-effects extravaganza . It is I think a universal truth of movie making that effects are never funny. They can sometimes wow you but they cant make you laugh and Depp cannot stand up to the hubbub they create. No actor can. He can only serve them which involves him in derring-do that any actor could do about as well as he can. He needs to be involved with us not with the lunking machinery of the movie. When for example hes miming alarm and confusion he gets to do some terrific ephemeral things with his eyes. Sometimes they are bright with half-formed schemes. Sometimes they are hard with a resolve that has not quite coalesced into a plan of action. Sometimes they are addled with a flickering panic he cant entirely hide. In these moments he takes us behind the conventional heros stoic mask and allows us to see Jack as case of arrested development  a pre-sexual child pretending to be a man of decisive action and romantic elan. Mostly though hes forced to give a bits-and-pieces fits-and-starts performance fighting for his life against crowds of the undead and the unfunny. Screen comedy is at its best when it pitches it tent close to the poverty line. Think Chaplin who once said that all he needed to be funny was a park a policeman and a pretty girl. Think Keaton who once did a brilliant special-effects comedy (Sherlock Jr.)  where you were almost unaware of his very subtle camera tricks. Think Grant Hepburn and their wayward leopard. For that matter think Something About Mary which pretty much took place in a cramped apartment. The minute the effects budget swells it starts to crush the life out of comedy which needs empty spaces to roam and some quality alone with the audiences in order to enlist its complicity in its subversions. Well you say maybe Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Mans Chest wasnt supposed to be all that funny. Maybe the fact that Depp decided to be brilliant was an unintended blessing bestowed on the original production which the sequel is sort of stuck with. He was so good doing as he confessed his imitation of the piratical Keith Richards that he grabbed the reviews that brought in as an unexpected increment a crowd of grown-ups looking for some wit in an unlikely place -- the multiplexes in summertime. This new film lends a certain credence to that supposition. It is as endless (at two and a half hours) as the Peter Jackson King Kong and like that misbegotten film it is intended for the last mass audience left to the movies -- adolescent males geekily parsing the effectiveness of its special effects. They will doubtless think theyre swell. The director Gore Verbinski has spared no expense in realizing them and theres no doubt in my mind that as a commercial proposition the film will be a winner. In every other way -- as adventure yarn or as satire on that form or merely as an enjoyable entertainment featuring a wonderfully sly and subtle actor -- it is not merely a loser. It is a disaster.

Not that theres anything wrong with that. The second ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie is a sweet umbrella drink leaving no hangover two hours and 20 minutes of escapism that once again makes the movies safe for guilt-free fun. In a summer of brooding heroes prattling cars and bickering lovers well gladly take Captain Jack Sparrow swishbuckling his way through the happy isles. Disney built ""Pirates"" around a decades-old theme park ride and wisely has decided never to take the concept more seriously than those humble origins deserve. Fire a few cannons let Keira Knightley shake out her hair toss a few elegantly rendered monsters on a beautiful beach and thanks for coming. Knowing your strength is an underrated virtue. ""Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Mans Chest"" opens in a rainstorm with lovely Elizabeth (Knightley) weeping in her bridal dress as Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) is hauled away in shackles. Since Governor Daddy (Jonathan Pryce) is now on the betrothed couples side its up to a new villain (Tom Hollander) to set the plot The whole family will be executed for aiding Sparrows escape in the first movie unless they find him and his magic compass. Sparrow (Johnny Depp) has problems of his own. Wherever Jack has been hiding it certainly wasnt in rehab for his rum- abuse problems. Captain Eyeliner is more fey and wobbly than ever as if marooned on Brokeback Island with a barrel of fermented molasses. Seems Jack is being chased by the ghost ship Flying Dutchman. Davy Jones called you see and he wants his soul back. Jacks lease on life is up plus a considerable damage deposit. The ghost ship is the magnificent addition of this ""Pirates"" (to be followed by the third installment next summer filmed simultaneously with the second). Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) and each of his pirates are half- fish by now what with living undersea half the time in the eponymous locker. Davys face and hair are an octopus and his slimy locks slither menacingly as he speaks. The big rotting barnacle of a ship is destined to be in a Disney park near you as a new ride. In fact much of the second ""Pirates"" looks like a tryout for possible Disney World attractions - on your next visit keep an eye out for ""Attack of the Calamari"" ""Voodoo Tree House"" ""Retreat from Cannibal Island"" or ""Tortuga Bar Fight."" Returning screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio add their signature buccaneer humor to the active proceedings. Sparrow makes a deal with Davy Jones staring into his squiddy face ""Yep Im good with it. Shall we seal it in blood? I mean ink?"" The more cultured villain who is the local operative for the East India Co. warns Knightleys Elizabeth ""Loyalty is no longer the currency of the realm Im afraid. Currency is the currency of the realm."" Thankfully we get more of Knightley in the new version her stock having risen even further since the Oscar nomination for ""Pride amp; Prejudice."" Knightleys is a face that could launch a thousand privateers and she gamely plays up the romantic triangle with Bloom and Depp. Director Gore Verbinski back from the first installment adds just enough depth to offer contrast between the rousing set pieces. Turns out Will Turners lost father is in servitude with Davy Jones and Stellan Skarsgard transmits as much poignancy as is customarily allowed through a mask of fish scales. You might want to run through your ""Pirates I"" DVD before hitting the theater - despite those claims of diminished loyalty Disney felt obligated to bring every cussing blunderbuss back for the sequel. Knightleys ex-fiance returns for a key role but by then weve completely lost track of the various kidnappings map clues and double-crossings. Theres a good bit of nonsense about that compass mostly so that we can watch Depps eyes roll and cross as he follows the needle. If it all gets too confusing take pirate Ragettis advice when told he doesnt have the capacity to read the book before him ""Its the Bible. You get credit for trying."" And the Disney crew gets credit for protecting its treasure with a worthy new effort. ""Pirates"" wont be sweeping many Oscars but its likely to find plenty of gold.

Johnny Depp gets his ARGH on again in Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Mans Chest. Photo Buena Vista Pictures Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Mans Chest 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Pirate flicks were box-office poison for so long that 2003s Pirates of the Caribbean Curse of the Black Pearl earned extra credit just for trying. But its first sequel Dead Mans Chest tries too hard. Emboldened by the original films 653 million global take producer Jerry Bruckheimer has made a monster turning a fun fresh romp into a misguided mishmash of special-effects excess and horror-show repellency. The charismatic cast that sparked the original is lost in a tempest of supernatural meanies and repulsive creepiness. Nor is storytelling high on the to-do list of director Gore Verbinski. Its often unclear whats going on beyond a zillion dollars of splashy effects washing over the screen. Like a ship that takes too much water over its bow Dead Mans Chest leans and lists circling the drain of its stalled plot before drowning in a fools paradise of costly yet empty visuals. Many involve a new set of heavies slimy slithery fish-men led by legendary evil ruler of the deep Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). Vile grisly and repugnant Jones and his hellish henchmen make Curses bone-baring ghost-pirates look as cuddly as Muppets. Films should pick their spots for gross-out effects. Here theyre a filthy filibuster. Chest also unleashes a sea beast for big ""money"" shots. Flinging sailors and trashing masts with huge writhing tentacles it looks just like the giant octopus in 1955s It Came From Beneath the Sea. The stars are almost afterthoughts. Though Curse launched Johnny Depp to belated megapopularity as charming rogue Jack Sparrow the cowardly captain chows down on few juicy scenes here. Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom have thankless parts as do-gooder young lovers bobbing in his wake. Their misadventures involve a quest for a chest containing Jones heart with many quick cuts to far-flung locales that would take weeks to reach by sail. Yet the 2 1/2 -hour film still feels slow. With a thin spine of plot holding up its bloated body of spectacle it staggers into a swashbuckling swoon. Its best stunts are low-tech a sword fight aboard a runaway water-mill wheel and our heroes frantic ascent of a chasm while trapped in a dangling net. Depp also has some choice lines such as ""To what do I owe the pleasure of your carbunkles?"" But this is an actor who thrives on challenges and he could play this part in his sleep. That leaves Nighy to steal the film even if he is a Gollum-style CG evocation. One of Britains most agreeable hams Nighy blusters and bellows through Jones misdeeds with much-needed conviction for this 200 million trifle. Like everyone else hes upstaged by effects notably his writhing tentacle-beard that looks like ZZ Top on a bad trip. But were sold. That booming Nighy voice. That quirky Nighy brand of jerky body language. Depp may have owned the first film but this time Nighy is the man.

What is then? ""Currency is the currency of the realm."" Its a clever line one of many in this sequel to the hugely popular original that opened three years ago. (Like that film the new one was directed by Gore Verbinski from a script by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio.) But time is the currency of the realm when youre watching a movie play out and this movie squanders time heedlessly. Its at least 30 minutes too long -- more of a megabudget meander over land and sea than a story with a dramatic structure. The cast is entertaining though with an asterisk and the special effects are often spectacular though sometimes not. Thats the patchwork nature of the production -- a pirate movie that ends up pirating its own abundant store of good will. Abundant is an understatement. The people who track audience awareness before a movies opening have been predicting that this new ""Pirates"" will be a monster hit and theres no reason to think otherwise patchiness -- and repetitiveness -- notwithstanding. Moviegoers are hungry for fun which in fairness they will find along the way -- all 150 minutes of the way. ENLARGE Johnny Depp is back as Captain Jack Sparrow the raffish pirate whom audiences loved for good reason the first time around. So are Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom as Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner. Elizabeth and Will are in prison as the sequel begins and their plans to get married are further complicated by the revelation of Jacks blood debt to Davy Jones an arrangement that could doom Jack to an afterlife of eternal servitude and infinite gloppiness. Buckets of glop and myriad tentacles bulk largest in the films special effects. Davy Jones who is played by Bill Nighy has a beard of restlessly squirming eerily prehensile octopus tentacles. Partly live and partly animated the character is entirely inspired. (Another character benefits from an inspired performance Naomie Harriss star turn -- never mind that the role is secondary -- as a sexy seeress named Tia Dalma.) But the aforementioned asterisk applies to Johnny Depp whose work in the original was a startlingly fresh blend of fey sly woozy and effete (and was famously modeled on Keith Richards). Though all of Jacks tropes are on display again they have unfortunately if predictably been dampened by the bilge water of self-comment. His walk has gone from merely eccentric to insistently mincing. Hes still funny yet he gets in his own way by signaling how funny he is. Orlando Bloom has little to call attention to. His performance is perfectly pleasant and generally dull. Keira Knightleys presence is agreeable if seldom affecting. During most of the film her dress -- without her in it -- gets more to do than she does. Vast sums of money have been poured into this production and theyve bought some marvelous moments Davy Jones as a mad organist his tentacles ranging across the keyboard; a majestic aerial shot of two scruffy thieves approaching the hull of Jacks beached ship; a vessel at sea snapped in two by a submerged leviathan (with enormous tentacles) and Davy Joness ship the Flying Dutchman racing over -- and spectacularly below -- the waves with a ghost crew of blighted barnacled sailors whove come to resemble creatures of the deep. As often as not though effects that are stunning at first glance dont withstand scrutiny a sort of giant open-sided geodesic dome that rolls through several scenes with a cargo of seamen trapped inside; a trio of swordfighters struggling to stay atop a big water wheel as it too rolls around the landscape. One never quite believes that the men are inside the dome or that the swordfighters are fighting on the wheel because the visual elements of these creations havent been fully integrated. They remain graphic notions in a film full of storytelling notions -- various characters either chasing or being chased as they search for the chest of the title plus a compass and a key. And all of it evidently based on another notion that great length equals great importance. Only Human ENLARGE Norma Aleandro (center) plays a family matriarch in Only Human. Screwball comedies about truly crazy families are rare and Im happy to report that ""Only Human"" (""Seres Queridos"") is one of them. This debut feature in Spanish with English subtitles was written and directed by Dominic Harari and Teresa De Pelegri. (The filmmakers are husband and wife.) The setting is Madrid where a young Jewish woman Leni is bringing her fiance Rafi home to meet her family. Since she has neglected to tell them that hes Palestinian you could say that the film is yet another riff on ""Guess Whos Coming To Dinner."" But that would be selling its originality short for ""Only Human"" stands on its own as a light-footed farce; the films witty trenchant take on Israeli-Palestinian relations adds substance without weighing the comedy down. Rafi whos played charmingly by Guillermo Toledo is basically a straight man in a warped situation. Theres no way that he an academic who teaches in Barcelona can cope with his in-laws-to-be Lenis sister Tania a part-time belly dancer and apprentice slut; Tanias six-year-old daughter Paula who insists shes pregnant (with twins); Lenis kid brother David implacably committed to Orthodox Judaism until Confucius beckons; her grandfather Dudu an incompetent blind man (after running his hands over Rafis face he still cant tell if its a man or a woman); and her frantic ironic mother who is played by the superb Norma Aleandro. The movies giddy pace falters when Lenis father makes his appearance as an amnesiac (whose sorry state has been induced by a falling container of frozen soup.) All in all though ""Only Human"" is winningly human and wonderfully funny.    DVD TIP Naomie Harris co-stars in Danny Boyles ""28 Days Later"" (2002) a powerful horror flick in which most survivors of an English pandemic prove to be classic zombies. She plays Selena a fiercely intelligent beauty with a ferocious instinct for self-preservation.

It was one of the most breathtakingly eccentric performances ever given in a big Hollywood franchise movie.In the disappointing sequel ""Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Mans Chest"" a strange thing has happened Depp doesnt figure in a large part of the action. Instead we are given interminable scenes featuring Captain Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) and his scurvy crew as well as far too many interludes involving dewy lovers Will (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth (Keira Knightley). Can it be that director Gore Verbinski and his screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio dont understand the secret to their own success?The film begins with Will and Elizabeth arrested on their wedding day for facilitating Jacks escape. The smarmy Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander) offers them their freedom if Will can retrieve Jacks magic compass. Beckett represents the imperial bureaucracy - the not-so-brave world of new-style buccaneers - while Jack and his rummy cohorts are the vanishing breed. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? I suppose theres a contemporary analogy being played out here It has long been true in Hollywood that most of the risk-taking mavericks have been replaced by functionaries. The irony is that this message is being proffered in a movie that doesnt take very many chances of its own. Its a franchise movie - a product - that is pretending to be a lot hipper than it is. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Even Depps performance is a bit of a letdown. He was so startling the first time around that through no fault of his own we cant possibly be as surprised by him now. The dreadlocks braided beard and eye shadow dont register with the same impact and neither does his fey swagger and mincing valor. Drizzled with beads and amulets and whatnot Jack is something of a walking tag sale but Depp lets his costuming and makeup do too much of the work for him. He seems to be impersonating Jack instead of inhabiting him.Hes still a lot of fun to watch though. (He has a particularly amusing escapade modeled on ""The Man Who Would Be King"" as the reluctant god of an island of cannibals.) Much has been made of the fact that Depp based his portrayal on the Rolling Stones Keith Richards (who is rumored to have a cameo as Jacks father in the third ""Pirates"" movie scheduled for release next summer). But the personality he most reminded me of was of all people Bob Hope who specialized in playing wisecracking cowards who always scrammed when the going got tough.Jack is a rebuke to the Douglas Fairbanks/Errol Flynn school of heroism and even though that school was wonderful in its heyday it has long been in recess and its a treat to see it skewered. Maybe Depp could be the next Superman and breathe some life back into that high-flying waxworks dummy? Or maybe in the sequel to this movie he will once again take charge. Too much of the current film is taken up with immense close-ups of Davy Jones his head a mishmash of octopi tentacles and Bootstrap Bill (Stellan Skarsgard) Wills father whose face is encrusted by the sea bottom. The movies gross-out effects are impressive but wearying. How apt that the directors name is Gore.Even worse in some ways is the bland prettiness of Bloom and Knightley. Bloom has never impressed me as a star and Knightley who grew up as an actress in the intervening three years from the first film is back in starlet mode.If you sit out the endless end credits youll see a quick visual joke a coda. Or you can skip it and beat the traffic. Grade B- Rated PG-13 for sequences of adventure violence including frightening images.

"Pirates of the Caribbean reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Pirates of the Caribbean reviewed. Pirates of the Caribbean reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 6 2006 523 PM Yo-Ho-Hum The dreary second chapter of Pirates of the Caribbean. By Dana Stevens Listen to Dana Stevens and Bryan Curtis Spoiler Special about  Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Mans Chest by clicking the arrow on the player below Johnny Depp swashbuckles in Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Mans Chest It would take more than just one bottle of rum to while away the 150-minute running time of Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Mans Chest (Disney). The movie itself is a kind of treasure chest albeit one so crammed with baroque visuals and tangled chains of plot that you have to sift through its overabundant contents in search of the odd pearl. In fact if not for the running commentary offered by the obliging 8-year-old on my right Id have had no idea what was going on as the movie depends heavily on in-jokes and references from the previous installment The Curse of the Black Pearl--a movie I always meant to see as soon as I felt sufficiently seaworthy. That day somehow never came. Dropping in on the middle chapter of a trilogy seems as good a way as any of assessing the state of the franchise. In the case of the Pirates brand complacency seems to have set in replacing what I gather was the bold freshness of the original movie (which nonetheless clocked in at a none-too-swift 143 minutes). Dead Mans Chest trades shamelessly on its status as the filler in the Pirates sandwich ending on a surprise twist thats a virtual advertisement for part three Pirates of the Caribbean At Worlds End (due out in 2007). The ending was so lazy that on the way out of the screening I saw total strangers commiserating on its crassness. Did we really just sit through two and a half hours of deafening action sequences wild plot twists and at least two false endings only to be told in essence to cough up 10 more next year? Advertisement The films crisscrossing storylines are both convoluted and utterly dispensable. First Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) the high-cheekboned lovers of the first installment are imprisoned during their wedding ceremony by a merchant-trading bad guy (Tom Hollander) who threatens to execute them unless they can lead him to a magical compass owned by Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Sparrow the mincing sexually ambivalent captain of the Black Pearl has problems of his own. He owes a blood debt to Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) the lord of the undersea world and to avoid becoming an eternal member of Jones gooey undead crew he must find the key to the chest containing Jones still-beating heart. All this nonsense is a fine pretext for much hoisting of grog shimmying of masts and near-roasting by island cannibals. If only the director Gore Verbinski had a feel for the propulsive energy needed to move a story forward. Despite his heartthrob status in real life Orlando Bloom has consistently functioned as a node of negative energy on-screen sucking the life force out of all who surround him. Nonetheless Keira Knightley with her radiant mouthful of Chiclet-sized choppers rallies as the plucky Liz. Knightley was too much the fairy-princess ingenue to make a credible Elizabeth Bennett in last years Pride amp; Prejudice but when it comes to stamping her foot in period dresses she has no peer.Asfor Depps Sparrow hes become a collection of tics in search of a character; he was probably more interesting in Depps script notes since he comes off as an enigmatic visitor from another movie. As Davy Jones the wonderfully soft-spoken British character actor Bill Nighy is unrecognizable beneath a foam-rubber head mask that turns him into a human cephalopod--not so much an octopus as a multipus with countless earthwormlike appendages wriggling independently (and disgustingly) around his sagging noseless yellow face. His head is one of the few takeaway images in a movie jammed to bursting with gross-out gags and eye-popping makeup jobs. For all its cynical money-grubbing Dead Mans Chest has moments of exhilarating  beauty (as when a monstrous sea creature rises from the deep to clasp the pirate ship in its tentacles as if in a giant hand) and spectacle (an extended swordfight conducted atop a spinning waterwheel recalls both Errol Flynn and Buster Keaton). The effects are breathtaking and much of the action is choreographed with energy and wit. (A chase sequence on a cliff uses visual gags that defy the laws of physics Wile E. Coyote-style.) But all of these moments bob on the films slick surface like so much flotsam. Without a beating heart at its center this Chest feels empty indeed. Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review The Depp Depp Sea Who cares about plot? The Pirates sequel is a wild ride all the same. Plus a French alter-ego trip. By David Edelstein Published ShareThis (Photo Peter Mountain/Courtesy of Disney Enterprises) Most sequels open flabbily and take your attention for granted The filmmakers figure theyve already hooked you and have all the time in the world. But the lack of a lean narrative line is an unexpected boon to Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Mans Chest a collection of swashbuckling set pieces with the hustle of a vaudeville show. The movies predecessor Curse of the Black Pearl started like gangbusters but lost its rudder and went around in circles. Plus it was half an hour too long (at least). This one is longer yet (two hours and 33 minutes for a pirate picture) and has no ending (a third installment was shot simultaneously) but has so much going on that you forget about niceties like plot or suspense. Zany cannibals A giant demonic octopus Half-man-half-fish pirate phantoms A three-man duel on a huge rolling wheel Keira Knightleys magic inflatable jaw And of course Johnny Depp doing . . . whatever it is hes doing. His eyes rimmed like a glam rockers his gait a tipsy tiptoe-through-the-tulips his Captain Jack Sparrow would win a gonzo-effeminacy contest with Marlon Brandos Fletcher Christianwhich I write with admiration and awe. BACKSTORY Johnny Depp has said that his inimitable pirate Jack Sparrow is probably gay and is certainly based on two of Depps main influences the wobbly Pepe Le Pew and the wobblier Keith Richards. Depp looked to Richards he said because pirates were the rock stars of their day. However being a true rock god Richards didnt jump at Disneys offer to cameo as Depps father in the third film (out next summer) reportedly saying The idea of working with Disney gives me shivers. Yet Jerry Bruckheimer recently announced that Richards has warmed to the ideathough he didnt say if that was because Disney offered him more booty. In Dead Mans Chest this maverick weirdo is dubbed a dying breed in an ever-smaller world by a shifty lord who takes his cues from the East India Trading Companyby no means the last instance of a multinational corporation using a countrys military to deliver massive profits to itself. Poor Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Knightley) find their nuptials postponed by imprisonment for treason; in exchange for the couples freedom Will must track down Captain Jack and obtain a compass that leads to a buried treasure chest with the heart of Davy Jones (of locker fame)to whom Jack has sold his soul. Early on I gave up on following the ins and outs of compasses and keys and sundry other MacGuffins and had fun thinking about confounded studio story execs being forced to hold their tongue in the face of the first films phenomenal grosses. The director Gore Verbinski has grown more adept at Spielberg-style action in which the fun is as much in the elegance of the staging as the stunts. I cant begin to diagram Jacks pole-vault with a spear full of tropical fruits and subsequent plunge through a series of rope bridges; and that rolling-wheel battle has so many variables its like a great Newtonian physics joke. Dead Mans Chest has fewer JMW Turner marine vistas and more creepy creaturesfishmen formed out of soil and seaweed and parts of crustaceans and mollusks. Davy Jones himself the Captain of the Flying Dutchman turns out to be a malicious mandibled squid-man a special effect with the hoary snarl of Bill Nighy (recognizable by his trademark little snort) Hes a blend of your worst nightmare above the decks and belowleagues below. Orlando Bloom is a study in blandnessbut hes largely a straight man for the rest of the cast which includes the false-eyeballed Mackenzie Crook and the scurvy Lee Arenberg as former Black Pearl ghost pirates whove managed to attach themselves to the good guys like a fungus and Naomie Harris as some kind of voodoo swamp priestess. And Bloom is given luster by the ardor of Knightley a heroine with gumption whose thrusting jaw takes her out of the insipid-ingenue class. Shes like some kind of fish herselfonly worthy of a jeweled tank. Depp has a riotous entrance that I wont spoil but theres no sense of discovery this time. An actor like this isnt made for sequels; he has new realms of looniness to conquer. As he demonstrated most vividly in Under the Sand the writer-director Francois Ozon has a thing for ocean beaches and a near-fetishistic identification with aging female beauties. In Time to Leave his protagonist is a gay man a thirtysomething Parisian glamour photographer named Romain (Melvil Poupaud) who learns he has inoperable cancer. In another sort of film the nearness of death would be a handy excuse for affirming his love for his basket case of a sister (Louise-Anne Hippeau) busybody mother (Marie Riviere) reticent father (Daniel Duval) and live-in boyfriend (Christian Sengewald). But Ozon deals in unbridgeable psychological distances and so Romain kicks out his lover and shares his bad news only with his aging-female-beauty grandmother (Jeanne Moreau) a narcissistic loner like himselfand of course the usual Ozon alter ego. The movie is a romance of estrangementterminal estrangement. Romain ends up happily by himself on a beach. From Tolstoys Ivan Ilych to Kafkas Gregor Samsa literature abounds in dying protagonists forced to reconcile themselves to their aloneness. But in Time to Leave theres something distasteful about Ozons unexamined solipsism. To fill (partially) the emotional vacuum he introduces a waitress (Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi) and her sterile husband (Walter Pagano) who are in need of an attractive sperm donorthereby giving Romain an opportunity (if he wants it) to leave something behind. The device would be laughable if not for the ache on Bruni-Tedeschis face. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Comments Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Mans Chest This sequel to Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl reunites the first movies director (Gore Verbinski) and screenwriters (Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio) and much of its cast (Johnny Depp Orlando Bloom Keira Knightley Jonathan Pryce) and theyre desperate to knock our socks off. I was worn down by the excess Depps fruity impersonation of Keith Richards (or William F. Buckley) as pirate Jack Sparrow; too many bottomless chasms on an island with too many jungle savages (after the fashion of Peter Jacksons King Kong); Bill Nighy playing too squishy a villain with a beard of too many crawling octopus tentacles; too much violence pop nihilism and sick humor. But the Disney logo at the beginning is neat. PG-13 140 min.

"Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Mans Chest | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; pirates-of-the-caribbean-dead-man-s-chest ) Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Mans Chest (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Before Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl was released its arrival was greeted with skepticism. After all this was a movie based on a theme park ride. The production went on to be one of the best reviewed motion pictures of 2003 and ""if"" questions about a second installment became ""when."" Because the follow-up story devised by director Gore Verbinski and writers Ted Elliott amp; Terry Rossio was too big for a single film the filmmakers decided to make Pirates 2 and Pirates 3 back-to-back (as was done with The Matrix and Back to the Future sequels and the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy) providing less down time in between episodes. The verdict for the middle movie of the proposed three-film arc although not as much fun as its predecessor it nevertheless delivers enough jaunty adventure and derring-do to keep fans entertained. The double-cliffhanger ending assures that audience members will be back for Pirates 3. In fact if the movie didnt look so good on the big screen I might be tempted to recommend that viewers wait for the next movie to open then rent this one and see them as a double-feature. Pacing is a problem for Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Mans Chest. The 155-minute long film lurches through about 60 minutes of set-up before launching into its main story in earnest. The amount of time it takes Verbinski to get all the pieces in play makes the plot seem more complicated than it is. Dead Mans Chest is essentially a quest movie find the key and chest and use one to open the other. Of course multiple factions want whats inside the chest so that sets up the conflict. Once everything is established the movie offers plenty of what made the first one so popular but theres a sense that Dead Mans Chest doesnt need to be as long as it is. Nearly everyone favorites and not-so-favorites are back. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) are about to be married when they are arrested on charges that they abetted the escape of the notorious Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). (See events of the first film for details.) Lord Cutter Beckett (Tom Hollander) the man behind the warrants doesnt really want to see Will and Elizabeth die. He wants to cut a deal. If they agree to help him hell see that they avoid the gallows. All they have to do is locate Jack and persuade him to give up his magic compass. Will goes first locates Jack ends up captured by a bunch of cannibals who worship the good Captain as their god then escapes with Jack and others onto the Black Pearl. Jack is searching for a mysterious key and an even more mysterious chest but hes not the only one. Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) a half-human half-squid who controls the mythological Kraken also wants the chest albeit for different reasons. Finding the chest becomes a race with Will trapped in between. Elizabeth frees herself from Lord Becketts clutches and joins the fray with the goal of saving Will then discovers to her horror that she may be more romantically attracted to the devious Jack than her straight-as-an-arrow fiancA(c). The comedy in Dead Mans Chest is more subdued than in The Curse of the Black Pearl but theres still a strong sense of irreverence. One of the movies biggest action sequences which takes place on an island and feature no less than five factions struggling for possession of two items is heavily influenced not only by Errol Flynn but by Looney Tunes and the Three Stooges. Yes theres sword action and ship-to-ship cannon action but theres also a runaway water wheel characters fleeing hither and fro and a monster that literally loses its head and keeps shouting orders. The movie isnt as flip as its predecessor but it avoids the deadly trap of taking itself too seriously. Then again its hard to figure how a production with the central character of Captain Jack could ever stumble into that pitfall. As he was in The Curse of the Black Pearl Jack doesnt know the meaning of the word ""serious"" even when hes staring into the maw of the Kraken. If its the characters that keep film-goers coming back theres reason to rejoice. Johnny Depps Captain Jack has lost none of his swishy swagger. Depp is in peak form again burying himself in the part and making the Captain the most dashing rogue this side of Han Solo. We dont see much of it but we believe Elizabeth when she asserts theres a heart of gold inside the carefree exterior. For her part Knightley has grown into Elizabeth. The character feels more integral to the story than in The Curse of the Black Pearl where she was more often than not the obligatory love interest. Dead Mans Chest takes Elizabeths romantic life in an unexpected direction as sparks fly between her and Jack. Knightley and Depp have chemistry; Knightley and Bloom do not. Therefore this pairing makes sense. Plus as theres a submerged goodness in Jack theres a hidden devilish side to Elizabeth. Orlando Blooms Will is a little more interesting this time around but not much more. Bloom is adequate and his legion of fans will have plenty to squeal about but he is often overshadowed by Depp and/or Knightley. Actually many of his scenes are with the CGI-enhanced Bill Nighy whose voice is marginally more recognizable than his features. Davy Jones represents a creepy villain (splendidly rendered on a computer) but he lacks the vicious charm of Geoffrey Rush. Viewers will feel the absence of Barbarosa (although not his monkey). Stellan SkarsgAY=rd joins the film as Wills dead (?) father Bootstrap Bill. (Death in the Pirates of the Caribbean universe is little more than a temporary inconvenience.) Jonathan Pryce (as Elizabeths father) and Jack Davenport (as Elizabeths former earnest suitor) both return as do the comedic duo of Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg as the series versions of C3PO and R2D2. In essence Dead Mans Chest gives us an opportunity to join old friends on a new adventure that isnt substantially different from the old one. Many of the same elements are here - ghost ships the walking dead hidden treasure - and thats all right because its part of what we might now refer to as the ""Pirates of the Caribbean formula."" The slow uneven beginning is more than compensated for by the rousing climax and the last scene promises more of the same the next time around with possibly greater things to come. If I had to choose between the first two films in terms of which provides the more full entertainment experience I would pick The Curse of the Black Pearl but Dead Mans Chest isnt far behind.

Starring Orlando Bloom Keira Knightley and Johnny Depp. Directed by Gore Verbinski. (PG-13. 150 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Epics come about by necessity. The material demands it. A story is too big and too grand to contain within the usual boundaries and so an epic is born. ""The Lord of the Rings"" for example became an epic film trilogy because its story could only be told in that form. Epics dont come about through sheer willpower by someone deciding to make an epic and then stuffing a weak story with a lot of junk. Do that and you dont get an epic just cinematic water torture on the order of ""Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Mans Chest."" This second installment in the ""Pirates"" trilogy is more than the usual bad or even numbingly horrible movie. Its an amalgam of many of the modern cinemas worst tendencies and modern filmmakings most unfortunate misconceptions. The film has an epic scale without an epic story epic characters epic ideas or epic emotions. The conversations are without wit and often without purpose. Much of the acting consists of mugging and empty gestures. Scenes are stretched out for no reason but to give the illusion of importance so that the story is buried under rubble. Worst of all director Gore Verbinski doesnt seem to understand the difference between motion and action. Its an important difference. Motion is just violence and tumult happening onscreen. Action is violence and tumult that actively advances the story. Of recent movies ""Mission Impossible III"" has action scenes while Peter Jacksons ""King Kong"" mostly consists of motion (at least in the Skull Island sequences). In ""Pirates"" whenever theres a battle or a fight or a chase scene the story comes to a dead stop while the filmmakers devise clever active ways for absolutely nothing to happen. The slightest incident is pumped up into a 10- or 15-minute segment. In one scene Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) has to escape from native islanders who want to use him in a ritual sacrifice. The movie has one inventive stunt (hes attached to a pole and finds himself stuck between two mountains) but by the time that stunt arrives its moment has long past. As Captain Jack the Pirate Depp seems to have lost some of the Keith Richards swagger that he had in the first installment but hes still game and willing to mug his way through the picture. Thats fine. The problem is that he has nowhere to take the character -- its a self-contained dead end -- while the filmmakers seem to have decided this time out to take Captain Jack seriously. It does Depp no justice to take the amusing caricature hes created and try to give it a complicated moral nature. Observe how uncomfortable how torn in two directions Depp looks in his heart-to-heart conversations with Keira Knightley as he tries to play a scene and remain Captain Jack at the same time. The story is an intentional tangle designed not to be untied until the end of the third installment which arrives next year. Elizabeth (Knightley) and Will (Orlando Bloom) are about to be married when theyre arrested for having sheltered Captain Jack from the authorities. Will is temporarily released on the condition that he find Captain Jack and retrieve a special compass. If he succeeds he and Elizabeth will be free. Meanwhile Jack is in pursuit of a ghost ship led by Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) who has an octopus-like face with sensitive tentacles and feelers. He heads a handsome crew that includes a hammer-headed officer and Stellan Skarsgard as Wills father who has rubbery barnacles growing on his face. Imagine the torment for a sensitive soul to be forced to sail for all eternity with costume rejects from ""The Phantom Menace."" The lead actors are not to be blamed. Bloom a popular whipping boy of late makes a fine vigorous young leading man and Knightley has the great advantage of intelligence. She brings an alert energy to her scenes but most of the time shes the only alert thing in them. Ted Elliott and Terry Rossios script is torturous. When characters have nothing to say to each other they write them fake-clever banter in which they still say nothing but leer and smirk while doing so. Purely functional scenes as when a witch (Naomie Harris) imparts necessary plot information are stretched beyond the snapping point. Do we need to be taken into the witchs inner sanctum? Do we need to see that she has blue teeth and is that a style choice or a product placement for Bluetooth technology? Everything is an occasion for a scene. So when a long boat approaches an island the movie doesnt cut to show the characters having arrived. Instead were treated to an interlude of meaningless banter between two rustics dragging the boat to shore as though Elliott and Rossio were Shakespeare and these were the grave diggers in ""Hamlet."" The inescapable conclusion to reach is that the goal was to make a long movie. But that goal is simply incompatible with also making good movie. Good long movies are long because they have to be. Theyre not made of air. -- Advisory Action interludes sexual situations grotesque macabre images. Younger viewers may be alarmed by the consequences of bad dental hygiene.

Dazzling Depp delivers the booty Updated 7/6/2006 709 PM ET E-mail | Print | By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Were it not for the surefire allure of Johnny Depp in his quirky swaggering repeat performance as Capt. Jack Sparrow Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Mans Chest (   out of four) would be just another sequel bigger splashier costlier but not necessarily better. In one hilarious turn of events Sparrow finds himself on an island where the native cannibals take him for a god. His escape may be the most unique action sequence of the summer and Depps skill in physical comedy and his facial expressions (those eyes have it) enhance the quirky fun. There also is a dazzling (though a bit too extended) scene of swordplay atop a large rolling wooden wheel that bests the duel between Bloom and Depp in the first film. But the plot is more convoluted with several loose ends left dangling. In general the other pirates dont seem to be having as much fun with the exception of the scraggly duo played by Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook who shine brighter this time around. And the ever-reliable Bill Nighy does a fine job obscured in special effects as supernatural villain Davy Jones. The story centers on Sparrows unpaid debt to Jones who reappears in ghostly form along with a scary-looking crew of seafaring phantoms whose faces are fused with barnacles coral starfish and other sea creatures. A few scenes seem to replicate signature tableaux from the Disney theme park ride. A soothsayer (Naomie Harris) lives in a wooden shack like the one located at the beginning of the ride. This sequel also is less inventive than the original. It gets off to a slow talky start then suddenly seems too conscious of jam-packing every scene with thrills and excitement. But it does deliver a combustible combination of ingredients for a summer blockbuster a cornucopia of action and dazzling effects some raucous humor and a large dose of Depps winning charm. (Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of adventure violence including frightening images. Running time 2 hours 29 minutes. Opens in some theaters tonight; nationwide Friday.)

"Yo-Ho-Hum washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Yo-Ho-Hum The natives arent the only ones who are restless Johnny Depp returns as the swashbuckling -- or is that swishbuckling? -- captain in Disneys tired ""Dead Mans Chest."" (Peter Mountain Disney Enterprises -- Reuters) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday July 6 2006 What do we want in a sequel? Just a little taste of the original or a triple serving piled high? ""Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Mans Chest"" opts for the latter. This Disney movie isnt a follow-up to 2003s ""Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl"" so much as its empty-calorie clone. Ah but there is one crucial difference Where the first movie crackled from the tension between Johnny Depps edgy character and the Disney movie he was in the sequels a comparatively lifeless exercise. As Jack Sparrow a caddish pirate given to swishy body language and slurred speech Depp was the original movies hero and its most subversive element. In the first film he exuded a vague gayness seemed a tad too drunk and deeply lost in his ""Spinal Tap""-style stagger and swagger. (Depp reportedly modeled his performance on Keith Richards and Pepe Le Pew.) As you watched you wondered ""Is this going to be too much too weird?"" Is he going to scare family audiences -- or lure them in? And how does a male Disney hero get away with that much eyeliner? This was the delicious undercurrent a sexually ambiguous Sparrow not just confounding fictional adversaries but sending titillating ripples of uncertainty through the rows of multiplex patrons. But one sea chest of plunder later -- 305 million in domestic box office -- it was clear that Depp as Sparrow worked (and why a third ""Pirates"" is in the works). And thats why ""Dead Mans Chest"" yields a fiery display of special effects and a lot of Depp but nothing startlingly new. Disney has conscientiously recycled seemingly every element from the first film Depps woozy shtick the ghoulish pirates he faces and the return of Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom. Even the 140-minute running time is about the same as its predecessor. Depp is still the lovable rascal with frilly sleeves scheming eyes and fey mien. Bending his wrists and pointing the heavily ringed fingers outward like an Alvin Ailey dancer our central rogue flaps his arms with delicate flourish at every turn. Those featherless wings also pump back and forth as he runs from face-painted islanders who want to sacrifice him. Or they jut horizontally as he teeters (as always infused with rum) to escape his enemies across the deck of his ship. But the encore feels forced and hollow -- a repeat performance thats too self-consciously delivered to be charming anymore. There is one scene where Sparrow is captured by the aforementioned islanders and speaks to them in the sort of condescending nativespeak youd expect to hear from Johnny Weissmuller in the old Tarzan movies. "" A boogie snickle snickle "" Depp says with a herky-jerky swagger that seems labored and unnatural. Hes too knowingly cute. Its as if hes become a holographic version of himself in the Disney theme park attraction that inspired the movie franchise in the first place. Perhaps Depp is following the example of his muse Richards whose band the Rolling Stones have themselves evolved from rock-and-rolls edgy naughty boys to corporate-sponsored image-manufactured caricatures of themselves. And when Richards joins the cast of the third ""Pirates"" movie playing Sparrows father that circle will be complete. In the first film Depp felt like the mischievous outsider -- almost threatening to sabotage the pirate potboiler he was in -- but now he seems very much the fully sanctioned insider preapproved to flounce and swirl through ""Dead Mans Chest."" Hes no longer a bad boy. Hes Mr. Adorable in glitter-rock beads. Depps role in the original served another function He managed to distract moviegoers from a film cluttered with subplots and lengthy exposition; the movie was hardly this reviewers tankard of rum but Depp entertained propelling it along. Returning screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio (collaborators whose credits include ""Aladdin"" and ""Shrek"") reproduced the same narrative anchors that marred the first film and worse render Knightley and Blooms characters into comely carriers of subplot. Thus Will Turner (Bloom) is dispatched to steal Sparrows mystical compass which is believed to lead to the chest containing the soul of Davy Jones. And Elizabeth Swann (Knightley) stows away as a man aboard Sparrows ship to find fiance Will whos presumed lost. When she becomes suddenly instantly attracted to Sparrow there seems to be no rhyme or reason except the obvious The two most beautiful marquee names in the film clearly must kiss. Its the money shot. In the major plot theme it seems Sparrow owes a blood debt to the octopus-headed Jones (Bill Nighy) and if he reneges hell forever be Joness deck slave. This story element at least engenders the movies most entertaining feature its CGI creations. The word ""editing"" may not be in director Gore Verbinskis lexicon (he directed the first ""Pirates"" ""The Mexican"" and ""The Weather Man"" among others) but he knows how to make barnacled monsters. There is a creepy pleasure in the shipload of spectral grotesque pirates who loom out of the depths to haunt Sparrows scheming soul especially the aforementioned Mr. Jones whose facial tentacles have sucker-studded lives of their own. Or you can marvel and chuckle at the Terry Gilliam-like visual comedy as a clutch of Sparrows shipmates -- trussed in a suspended net made of bone and hide -- swing their prison back and forth to traverse a deep chasm to safety. Just dont look for the collision of innocence and danger that made the first film so provocative. It has disappeared beneath the waves headed straight for Davy Joness locker. Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Mans Chest (140 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for intense adventure violence including frightening images.

"Movie Review Curses `Pirates of the Caribbean sequel lacks originals wit and magic - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Curses `Pirates sequel lacks the magic of original By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  July 6 2006 Arrr keelhaul the blaggards The dreaded curse of the sequels hits home with a vengeance in ``Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Mans Chest"" a noisy and lazy stopgap movie that goes absolutely nowhere and takes 2 1/2 hours to get there.Where 2003 s ``Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl "" was a happy surprise -- a theme-park movie invested with wit and genuine movie magic -- this go-round feels sodden almost from the first frame. Nearly all the players have returned director Gore Verbinski and his screenwriting team; sigh-guy Orlando Bloom as noble Will Turner and Keira Knightley as the fetching Elizabeth Swann; and as the scrofulous Captain Jack Sparrow one Mr. John Depp Esq.All thats missing is a plot amusing dialogue comic timing and a reason to exist. Presumably these will come in the third installment already filmed and due in theaters next May. For now the abruptness with which ``Dead Mans Chest"" leaves audiences hanging borders on contempt.The tattered story line sends first Will then Elizabeth  out onto the briny to find Jack Sparrow. Threatened with execution by dastardly East India Trading Company head Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander) Will is charged with bringing back a certain magic compass in the pirates possession. Elizabeth just wants Will back.What does Jack Sparrow want? To escape the clutches of Davy Jones himself who sails the Flying Dutchman above and below the bounding main with a crew of the damned that includes Wills own pa (Stellan Skarsgard). First though Jack must find a key that leads to a buried chest that leads to . . . well far be it from me to spoil one of the movies few surprises. One senses though that the plans for the ``Pirates of the Caribbean"" videogame were mistaken for the movie script at a crucial juncture.Davy Jones is played by the wonderful character actor Bill Nighy (``Love Actually "" ``The Constant Gardener "") a curt Scottish accent hissing under a computer-generated ``mask"" of octopus skin and squiggly tentacles. All the Flying Dutchman crew have morphed into humanoid sea beasts over the centuries and much the best part of ``Dead Mans Chest"" comes from grooving on the amazing character animation provided by Industrial Light and Magic and five other CG houses. It may be the first movie where the critters out-act the humans.The Hammerhead Shark sailor the Hermit Crab sailor the old salt with a face like a lionfish This is high-calorie summer spectacle as eye-popping as it is intermittent. (Its also problematically scary for smaller children; in terms of all-around violence gore and fright factor this may be one of the hardest PG-13s yet released. No nudity though since you know how that warps the kids.) Depp was the first films most special special effect of course and he reinvented the pirate cliche before our disbelieving eyes as a sort of drunken Douglas Fairbanks-style camp swashbuckler. (Keith Richards whos slated to appear as Jacks father in the third film is the acknowledged reference point but Depp knows the roots go f arther back.) The star labors mightily here and he gets what laughs he can but after the 17th eye roll and stagger its obvious hes semaphoring it in.The problem is that Verbinski and his writers havent written scenes -- theyve written ideas for scenes and then told Depp and the other actors to wing it. The dialogue sequences stall aimlessly 30 seconds in and the jokes are groaners (``Wheres that dog swimming to?"" ``He saw a catfish""). When in doubt the cast falls down. It doesnt help that there are too many characters to sensibly keep track of In addition to the leads and the villains theres Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg as two Mutt-and-Jeff sailors Elizabeths father (Jonathan Pryce) and the disgraced Norrington (Jack Davenport) from the first film a voodoo queen played by Naomie Harris and the crew of a British commercial vessel.Every so often the film sends in the Kraken Davy Jones s personal sea monster; again the special effects here are remarkable and the din fearsome. When Verbinski ignores the actors and concentrates on comic action scenes hes on safe ground. An extended chase on a cannibal island is a nice piece of clockwork knockabout as is a bit with a runaway mill wheel later on. The sword duels though are mostly frantic waving and swishy sound effects -- wheres Basil Rathbone when you need him? -- and the editing is surprisingly awkward for a major motion picture. These seas are choppier than they should be.Will it matter? The preview audience I saw ``Dead Mans Chest"" with sat stonily through most of the movie laughed with relief when a solid gag came along and walked out trying to convince themselves theyd had a good time and that the ridiculous ending -- heres your hat see you next May -- wasnt an insult after 150 minutes of shambolic big-budget vaudeville. The third ``Pirates"" may come too late With ``Dead Mans Chest"" the franchise is back to the rickety amusement-park ride it started as.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Picking up where its disproportionately successful predecessor left off it sees the charismatically amoral pirate Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) once again embroiling young lovers Will (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) in a supernatural nautical escapade this time involving an outstanding debt to Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) a maritime Mephistopheles with a beard like the back half of a squid a crew of humanoid devil-fish and the kraken itself at his disposal.As part of a franchise famously based on a theme park ride Dead Mans Chest lives up to its heritage with regular bouts of adrenalised spectacle - cannibals are dodged and ravines tumbled down giant tentacles flail and ships crack and sink - and a structuring principle of again again Its not without excitement or wit but as the two-and-a-half hour running time wore on I increasingly felt that Id seen this bit before thanks and would rather like to get off now. Ted Elliott and Terry Rossios screenplay takes familiarity with the first film for granted but is conspicuously unconcerned with internal cohesion wheeling on characters from the backstory (Jack Davenport Stellan Skarsgard) without giving them anything interesting or constructive to do. Nighy gives good sneer even from behind a molluscan carapace and Depp remains great fun all swaggering slur and tipsy mince. But Bloom and Knightley are wet through before leaving land and as the film heaves from one muddily motivated set-piece to the next McGuffins accruing like barnacles all the while (the sketch the key the papers the chest the heart) it takes on the sinking feeling of a vessel adrift sending out flares.

""A mirthless course of script beats and busy action sequences"" is what I arggghed back then mustering only a mild yo-ho-ho for Johnny Depps glam-rock vamping as pirate/Village Person Capt. Jack Sparrow. I see now that I was wrong about the original Its a thing of balletic grace theatrical richness of character and self-effacing economy of action when compared with the shapeless weightless endless sequel -- a version 2.0 that in its final minutes portends a future 3.0 of such necessarily staggering ostentatious extravagance as to bankrupt all but the most iron-walleted of Hollywood producers. Yes indeed Pirates 2.0 is a theme ride if by ride you mean a hellish contraption into which a ticket holder is strapped overstimulated but unsatisfied and unable to disengage until the operator releases the restraining harness. Theres a big moviegoing chasm between joy and Pavlovian response and this baby plunges headlong into the abyss in a summer when other equally escapist big deals manage to keep their wits about them. So first to the barely intelligible plot -- not that the plot in Dead Mans Chest matters a fig anyway except insofar as young sweethearts Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) are once again thwarted from as they say in classic pirate movies getting it on. This time what stands between the two photogenic romantic leads is bluster from a new villainous British prig-in-a-wig some twitty adult who demands that Will do some impossible thing or another to earn his freedom. Or else. (Or else what? Like wed care? Like Will and Liz are anything other than whirling teacup figurines?) Meanwhile Jack (the louche weirdness now ratcheted up by the one-of-a-kind Mr. Depp so that jumpin Jack is an exotic Cage aux Folles bird of even fancier lip twitches wrist curls and rouged feathers) owes a debt to the underworldly lord of the waterlogged Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). And Jones commands a ship of dead fools disfigured with pulsating curling slimy goiters and squid-like protuberances. This army of the deep suggests the very picture of ick by teen standards conjured through the very fanciest of special effects; the clattering skeletons of the original Pirates look positively minimalist by comparison. Beneath the tangle of Jones facial pasta its possible ever so faintly to make out Nighys own familiar welcome characteristic head tilts more usefully employed by the delightful British actor in just about anything else he has ever done but doubtless never more handsomely remunerated. Anyway as Jack Will and Elizabeth work cooperatively the makers of Dead Mans Chest hurl obstacles in the trios way with the tenacity -- and undifferentiated agitation -- of shipboard monkeys. Clash after calamity after jokey mishap ensues with time enough for many of the original secondary players to cash their own paychecks. Remember the BBC Offices Mackenzie Crook as that skinny scurvy seafaring knave with the loose fake eyeball prone to going astray? Theres more eyeball rolling where that came from. But see this is where the cheat between sensation and satisfaction comes in a substitution only likely to become more commonplace as the Pirates franchise becomes the very model of modern studio brand extension. Without character wheres the consequence? Without consequence wheres the joy? Without an artistic stake in eliciting joy (or sadness or concern or something other than a glazed giggle at Depps finery) theres nothing to keep producer Jerry Bruckheimer director Gore Verbinski and their screenwriting galleymates from piling on another big false ending and another and another Caribbean without end until a pummeled audience begs for a toilet break and for mercys sake a real conclusion. Discounting adrenaline rush fright nausea and relief as evidence of dramatic effect there are no consequences in a theme-park ride You get on you get jiggled you get off. Maybe you even ask for another go-round because it feels so good when the jiggling stops. Difference is a ride runs a few minutes while Dead Mans Chest cranks for what feels like an infernal eternity.

There is a sense of bloat and where-do-we-go-from here aimlessness to this unconscionably protracted undertaking. Public anticipation is such that nothing can stop pic from filling up with B.O. gold. Disneylands ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" ride may have been improved but the film franchise has been downgraded with this first of two sequels to the 2003 popcorn smash. As with the two ""Matrix"" follow-ups which were shot back-to-back like the second and third ""Pirates"" entries there is a sense of bloat and where-do-we-go-from here aimlessness to this unconscionably protracted undertaking. As with the ""Matrix"" pictures however public anticipation is such that nothing can stop ""Dead Mans Chest"" from filling up with B.O. gold; pic is like a slot machine that gobbles up the publics money while giving little back and somehow people dont mind. Even judged strictly as a commercial product this new effort seems misguided. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer made sure the key players -- Johnny Depp Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley as well as director Gore Verbinski and much of the crew -- reboarded for the continued voyage and no expense has been spared in order to make the effects even more spectacular this time around. But why wear out the films welcome with a wearisome two-and-a-half-hour running time when a tight-ship 100 minutes would have insured more constant excitement not to mention giving exhibitors more showtimes per day? The first ""Pirates"" innocuousness and all became a 654 million-grossing worldwide phenomenon by virtue of a shrewd blend of old-fashioned storytelling tropes and modern push-button thrill-ride construction. But primary viewer affection stemmed from Depps utterly eccentric rendition of a drunken sailor as an inadvertent hero; pic mainstreamed the actors appeal to an unprecedented extent while allowing him to keep his cool. Inevitably the effect of his wild makeup and costume mincing manner and carefully calculated unpredictability proves less arresting the second time around. The surprise is gone but so is the nearly faultless comic timing not to mention any good lines. Depp may have been taking risky shots in the dark in creating Jack Sparrow three years ago but they all felicitously found their mark. This time the characterizations haphazard nature becomes transparent; even his best moments trigger only giggles and the fumbling takes what wind there is out of the pictures sails. Scenario by the returning team of Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio consists of too many over-elaborated searches by various parties for three items a not entirely reliable compass a treasure chest and the key that will open it. Among those involved in the multiple pursuits is Will Turner (Bloom) imprisoned with his bride-to-be Elizabeth Swann (Knightley) by nefarious East India Trading Co. rep Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander) and forced to track down Captain Sparrow who sets sail on the Black Pearl in an attempt to wrest control of the chest from Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) captain of an undead pirate crew capable of considerable nautical mayhem. Dramatic line consists entirely of connecting the dots between extravagant and aspirationally comic action scenes which prominently include an escape from cannibals by several men who jointly move in a large viney ball; a three-way sword fight choreographed across an entire island and partly conducted as men peddle the slats of a vast mill wheel as it rolls hither and yon (a gag Buster Keaton would have enjoyed -- and done better) and multiple attacks by a ferocious giant octopus whose grotesque beaky mouth when finally seen in close-up is the stuff of Freudian male nightmares. Still the f/x highlight is undoubtedly the mossy gang -- Davy Jones misshapen sailors doomed to a purgatory of servitude on board the Flying Dutchman a mildewy craft of astonishing speed that functions like a submarine above and beneath the waves. As in a clever cartoon these barnacled men are each distinctively conceived from the mate who resembles a Hammerhead shark to the bloke whose head remains half-hidden within a shell. Best of all is Davy himself whose remarkable visage is festooned with a beard of moving octopus tentacles and whose strength as a singular villain is heightened by Nighys wily performance. But the problem with the ""Pirates"" films and with this one more than the first is that theres not a genuine moment in them -- no point of human contact (except perhaps for the Herculean efforts of Stellan Skarsgard behind heavy makeup to provide hints of a tragic dimension as Wills doomed father); theyre baldly concocted confected engineered. ""Dead Mans Chest"" puts the viewer into a bland stupor willing to be entertained and maybe audiences will be up to a point by the beautiful actors sumptuous production values and the stray desires the film may stimulate to go to Disneyland or Las Vegas. These are the odd films that succeed by stirring neither the emotions nor the mind.
