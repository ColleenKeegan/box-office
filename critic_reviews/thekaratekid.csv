Jackie Chan and Jaden Smith in The Karate Kid Hanging over any remake but especially over the remake of a classic is the question ""Why?"" Sometimes that syllable is muttered with a shrug of resignation (""The Wicker Man with Nic Cage? Why?""). Sometimes its bellowed to the uncaring heavens in agony (""Last Tango in Paris with Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes? WHYYY?""). Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The notion of remaking The Karate Kid (Sony Pictures) elicits a ""why?"" of midlevel outrage. The 1984 original in which Noriyuki ""Pat"" Morita coaches bullied teenager Ralph Macchio to victory in a karate championship may have seemed like a standard-issue inspirational sports picture at the time but (as with another box-office hit of the same year The Terminator) a generation of remove reveals what a well-crafted movie it actually was. Rewatched today the original Kid directed by Rockys John G. Avildsen feels smart and fresh with a wealth of small character details and a leisurely middle section that explores the boys developing respect for his teacher. Advertisement The first job of the new Karate Kid then was to not defile the spirit of the original--at that task this version succeeds almost too well. The script by Christopher Murphey reproduces the story of the earlier film beat for beat and at times line for line. Its respectful to the point of reverence an odd stance to take toward a film that was fun in the first place because of its unpretentious pop schlockiness. To the credit of both Murphey and director Harald Zwart that unhurried middle act remains intact--instead of using the nearly 2 1/2-hour running time to cram in extra fight scenes they give the mentor/student relationship at the movies heart time to unfold. While the fight scenes have been (literally) punched up by the inclusion of more spectacular martial-arts stunts--along with the bonecrunching sound effect now required to accompany all onscreen fisticuffs--this Karate Kid isnt the rushed coarsened CGI-infested ripoff that fans of the original may be dreading. Its as sweet-natured a movie as you could expect about a 12-year-old learning to beat the crap out of his schoolmates. One of the few big changes here in fact is the lowering of the protagonists age. This karate kid Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) is truly a kid rather than the 15-year-old high-schooler of the original. Its easy to see why the change was made--teenage viewers more jaded now than they were in 84 would go out of their way to avoid identifying with the naivete of a character like Macchios virginal knock-kneed Daniel-san. Youthening the hero is also a way to draw younger kids and families into the films target demographic. It would be hard to sell a ""teen movie"" without at least a little sex but Dre Parker can have a PG-rated romance that culminates in a chaste peck. The problem is that rethinking Dre and his oppressors as preteens places the audience in the uncomfortable position of rooting for harm to be visited on children most notably on a cherubic-faced bully named Cheng (Wang Zhenwei) who pounds Dre to a pulp on the playground in an early scene. The second big change this Kid makes is to swap SoCal for China. Where the original had Macchio and his single mother moving from New Jersey to Los Angeles the opening credits of the remake show Dre and his single mother (a tartly funny Taraji P. Henson) relocating from Detroit to Beijing (where the movie was filmed on location) after her auto-industry job forces her to change continents. Dre is miserable in their new life He has no friends cant speak a word of Chinese and cant seem to turn a corner without being waylaid by Cheng and his glowering minions. The one bright spot is his crush on a cute violin prodigy Meiying (Han Wen Wen) but her parents are none too happy about her blowing off practice time to hit the gaming arcade with an American boy. One afternoon after school Dre is cornered by Cheng and his toughs in an alley. Theyre about to give him the whaling of a lifetime when Dre sees his buildings taciturn handyman Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) enter the fray and using some tricky comic kung fu defeat the boys without directly laying a hand on any of them (rather he uses them as props to beat up each other). Han is unforthcoming about the origin and extent of his martial-arts prowess but gradually he lets himself get talked into training Dre for a kung fu tournament that will also be attended by Cheng amp; Co. (Calling this movie The Karate Kid as if all martial arts were interchangeable seems like a transparent grab for brand recognition since the only sport we see practiced is kung fu. The distinction is lost on me but will obviously mean a lot to the films global audience.) What The Karate Kid lacks in originality it makes up for in execution--well maybe not quite but there are many pleasures along the way including a satisfying running joke about Dres refusal to hang up his jacket when he gets home from school. Jaden Smith the 11-year-old son of Will and Jada Pinkett Smith is lithe compact impressively athletic and full of self-confidence just the opposite of the gawky shambling Macchio. As a performer Smith is a bit of a show pony with his fathers habit of deploying charm as a defense. But just like Will this even-fresher prince gets away with it 90 percent of the time. As for Chan his economy of gesture becomes more impressive with every role. In this film he fights once cries once speaks very little and smiles not at all. And yet improbably this impassive man provides the films emotional center. His grave expression suggests such untold depths that a backstory seems almost unnecessary though his character is provided with one midway through the film. The Karate Kid has its problems. Its fight scenes while free of visible gore are disproportionately violent for the age group theyre aimed at. The films view of the assimilation process errs on the side of rosiness Dre manages to get by without ever learning Chinese and any problems he might have faced as a specifically African-American child in China are glossed over quickly. But when you look at the movies being released for and about children so many of which manage to combine inappropriately adult content with a babyish condescension toward their viewers The Karate Kid starts to look pretty good. If I had a child near Dres age Id drag him or her out of Marmaduke and into The Karate Kid--but not before requiring an at-home screening of the still unsurpassed original.

By Peter Rainer Film critic June 11 2010 Save for later Saved Jackie Chan as Mr. Han right and Jaden Smith are shown in The Karate Kid. Jasin Boland/Columbia Pictures - Sony/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The new ""Karate Kid"" starring the frisky Jaden Smith and the charming Jackie Chan is closely modeled sometimes right down to camera angles and dialogue on the 1984 hit starring Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita. That film came out of the rah-rah ""Rocky"" era when underdogs always won (even if they didnt). This may sound like our era too except that in the movies this particular formula is in semi-hiatus. The latest ""The Karate Kid"" will probably work best for young audiences unaware of its predecessor - or of much of anything else for that matter.In this version the 12-year-old boy Smiths Dre Parker moves with his widowed job-relocated mother (Taraji P. Henson) from Detroit to China where he immediately warms to a cute violinist schoolmate (Han Wenwen) and is pounded by the local bully (Wang Zhenwei). Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? He doesnt however experience much culture shock. Dre though intelligent seems remarkably uninterested in the ways of the Chinese except of course for kung fu. (The film should really be called ""The Kung Fu Kid."") Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? He prevails upon Mr. Han (Chan) a somewhat dissolute aphorism-spouting handyman to teach him how to defend himself. (Its a disappointment that Chan does very little fighting here.)The usual learning curve montage ensues and Dre eventually ends up in the big local kung fu tournament complete with instant replay as he faces off for the championship against - are you ready for this? - the bully.The pummelings that Dre endures leading up to this match are disturbingly violent and so is the tournament finale. Its all a bit much. Dres doting mother for example despite the occasional grimace and gasp cheers him on as if he was vying for a volleyball championship. Wouldnt she be a wee bit more horrified? I realize this is not an overwhelmingly reality-based movie but still. Especially in this kidpic genre doesnt a realistic depiction of violence demand a realistic response? Grade B- (Rated PG for bullying martial arts action violence and some mild language.)-----More Monitor movie reviews The A-Team John Rabe Coco Chanel amp; Igor Stravinsky Recent Movie Reviews Star Trek Beyond is consistently entertaining Norman Lear Just Another Version of You is a testimonial to an icon The Innocents The subject of the film is more arresting than the movie Print/Reprints About these ads Sponsored Content by LockerDome About these ads About these ads We want to hear did we miss an angle we should have covered?

Media San Francisco Chronicle The Karate Kid Starring Jackie Chan and Jaden Smith. Directed by Harald Zwart. (PG. 140 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The Karate Kid isnt one really. Hes more of a Kung Fu Kid a saucy American 12-year-old who moves to Beijing with his single mom and winds up bullied by a gang of menacing students under the tutelage of a sociopathic kung fu master. The boys only hope is a mild-mannered custodian who instructs him in the Chinese martial arts prepares him for a tournament and helps him confront the goons - and his own fears. But theres no messing around with iconic titles so ""The Karate Kid"" it is a fine fun remake of a movie that updates transplants and reimagines the original without sacrificing its heart or goofy charm. At times shockingly brutal for a movie about a barely pubescent child it nevertheless retains a spry comic vibe and a loose-limbed jangliness. Whats more its simply gorgeous a love letter to the mountains and mystery of a landscape not often celebrated in big-budget Hollywood output. One other thing Jaden Smith is now officially a star. Sure hes appeared onscreen before in ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" and with his dad Will in ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" but this is his first time carrying a movie. As Dre Parker the cornrowed new kid in town Smith exudes more unfiltered charisma than the entire cast of ""Marmaduke"" - counting humans and dogs. And that face. It registers every emotion normally processed by children and a few that arent including saintly levels of compassion and stoicism. The Pat Morita to Smiths Ralph Macchio is Jackie Chan the well-duh choice to play a martial arts guru whos tough on the outside squishy at the middle - a man with a little beard and a large font of wisdom. As with the 1984 film the real sport of ""The Karate Kid"" lies not in Dres increasingly violent clashes with his pip-voiced tormentors but in the unhurried rhythms of his relationship with his mentor Mr. Han. Despite the movie being overlong by about 20 minutes it gives Dre time to grow and romance a sweet young violin student (Wenwen Han) one of the weaker points in Christopher Murpheys reworked screenplay. More effective are the scenes with his mom portrayed with laser-like exactitude and hysterically apt mugging by the great Taraji P. Henson. Harald Zwarts previous effort as director was the critically panned ""The Pink Panther 2"" but if as Mr. Han maintains ""Everything is kung fu"" then Zwart has landed a roundhouse kick to the critics whove been hating on him all these years. -- Advisory Bullying martial-arts action violence and some mild language.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 11 2010 1201AM EDT Last updated Thursday May 30 2013 1243PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Country USA Language English THE KARATE KIDDirected by Harald ZwartWritten by Christopher MurpheyStarring Jaden Smith and Jackie ChanSome kids have parents who take their kids to movies. Others have parents who buy them starring roles. The latter is the case with Jaden Smith whose parents Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith helped produce this remake of the 1984 hit Karate Kid. The original was an amiable bit of hokum starring Ralph Macchio and Noriyuki ""Pat"" Morita and it launched several sequels in the next decade. Smith plays Dre Parker 12-year-old son of a widowed mother (Taraji P. Henson) who works in the car industry moves him with her from Detroit to Beijing. No question young Smith who was 11 at the time this current film was shot is a gorgeous kid with his mothers delicate features and his dads swagger. He is always watchable in this expensively designed vehicle as he does his own stunts dances delivers quips and offers a convincing impression of a pocket-sized movie star.Smiths charisma isnt always an asset to the movie though. Unlike the unknown Macchio in the original Kid theres nothing vulnerable about Smith except for his diminutive size which is its own problem. Whether the tiny star (he looks nine) is shown kissing a girl or being subjected to special effects-enhanced kicks that could cripple a pro athlete the effect isnt so much dramatically gripping as ill-conceived. Who wants to see kids get hurt?The smack-downs come early and often. Initially Dre finds the obvious things about his familys relocation like using chopsticks and the language a challenge. Then things get worse. After he makes a play for a pretty violin player (Wenwen Han) in the playground Dre finds himself the target of a bully Cheng (Zhenwei Wang) and his gang. They collectively study under a sadistic martial arts teacher who promotes a radical maim-first bow-later method of kung fu.Cheng and his posse bully the newcomer viciously until during one of the attacks Dres reclusive apartment-building supervisor Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) intervenes. With a few twists of sleeves and body spins Han manages to cause most of the gang members to knock themselves down. Its Chans only fight scene in the film and the only hint of his trademark slapstick fighting style but again its uncomfortable watching him apply his human Mixmaster technique on the heads and bodies of adolescents.Working against type Chan plays a shuffling depressive man suffering from his own emotional wounds and its refreshing to see him underplay a part for a change. Drawn out of his shell by Dres predicament Mr. Han decides to help train him in his kind of kung fu in preparation for a tournament in which Dre can face his tormentor one-on-one.The movie sticks to the plot of the first Karate Kid which was essentially director John G. Avildsens Avidlsens youth version of his previous hit Rocky. The updates screenwriter Christopher Murphey and director Harald Zwart ( Agent Cody Banks) dont mess too much with the formula. Instead of the car waxing drill of the first film Dre is ordered to pick up and drop his jacket innumerable times to practice his fight moves. Otherwise the script follows the predictable path from humiliation to humility to a climactic showdown complete with a deciding slow-motion kick.The main difference in this newly globalized version of the film is inflation. The biggest Hollywood-Chinese co-production to date The Karate Kid makes sure its Chinese state-run producers get their moneys worth (the Chinese provided about one-eighth of the films U.S. 40-million budget) with pretty scenic shots of the Great Wall and Forbidden City and a Taoist holy site at Wudang Mountain. The sanitized travelogue helps bloat the movies running time to well over two hours though that isnt exactly a flaw. Your kids can enjoy some culturally instructive scenery between the flying head kicks.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post In a marketplace mad for 3D its good to see a dramatic adventure built for young audiences (and the rest of us) that achieves its depth the old-fashioned way with characters struggling and maturing. Of course ""The Karate Kid"" starring Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan is a reboot of the 1984 hit. So perhaps the right verb is ""renovated"" not ""built."" Even so director Harald Zwarts film is a solidly constructed tale of an adolescent finding his way with the help of an unlikely mentor. Son of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith Jaden Smith portrays Detroit import Dre Parker. When his mother Sherry played with snap and concern by Taraji P. Henson lands a job in Beijing the popular kid becomes the uneasy newcomer. tagkid drama They arrive in this bustling new land and immediately the mildly cocky 12-year-old catches the ire of the school bully Cheng (Zhenwei Wang). He also makes a nice connection with Mei Ying (Wenwen Han) a violin prodigy who gets a kick out of the brash newcomer. Chan is Mr. Han their buildings maintenance man. He lives alone has a beat-up car parked in his living room. He is also a kung-fu master. Although the movie is rated PG Dres first beat-down is barroom brutal. Chengs motivations are murky and arbitrary the way bullying can so often be. Chengs bullying is an abuse of his kung-fu talents. His teacher is a merciless taskmaster. At one point Dre presses up against a school wall to avoid his pursuer of unhappiness. Dres face captures what constant harassment does to kids daily routine to their sense of place. Hes anxious and exhausted. As hinted at in ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" Smith is comfortable on a set. (Mom and Dad were producers here.) It will be interesting to see what he does as he grows through the hard-to- elude child-acting stage. Its Chan who shows tantalizing moments of maturity. The actor indulges his trademark talent for combining martial arts antics with agile action in a brawl with Cheng and his kung-fu classmates. Its the kind of witty choreography weve come to expect from the actor. More surprising is the way Chan relaxes into wounded emotions that lead this loner to aid a fatherless boy. On its way to a tournament showdown between bully and neophyte -- and two different kung-fu philosophies -- ""The Karate Kid"" delivers charming and pensive moments. Mei Ying gets a subplot of her own She is training for a spot in the prestigious Beijing Orchestra. Theres a winning scene when the disciplined student lets loose at one of those arcade dance challenges. On a train to the school where Mr. Han learned kung fu Dre falls asleep. The image of Mr. Han and Dre on a train the youngun asleep on his teachers shoulder has understated grace. Theres a moment when Mr. Han kneels next to the car an electric buffer in his hand. Two guys at a preview screening couldnt help but anticipate the unforgettable lesson of Mr. Miyagi in the original. (Pat Morita was Oscar nominated for his supporting turn.) ""Wax on. Wax off. Wax on. Wax off"" they whispered. It unlikely there will be any nominations for this outing. Or any lines quite so indelible. Still ""The Karate Kid"" has its share of pleasures both kicking and contemplative. Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com.

The very ordinariness of its leads underlined its message of untapped potential within everyone leaving an indelible mark on so many childhoods.This Karate Kid in contrast is an unabashed star vehicle. Harald Zwart directs Jackie Chan as reclusive teacher Mr. Han and star-on-the-rise Jaden Smith as 12-year-old Dre Parker a fatherless boy in need of a mentor who can help him find self-discipline and fend off threatening bullies. Jaden Smith of course is the 11-year-old son of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith.That said Chan and Smith could not be more likable along with their cast of young Chinese actors particularly Wenwen Han who plays Jadens young violin-virtuoso love interest with a luminous smile and a lyrical laugh. That may be enough to satisfy the kids along with the breathtaking setting most of it in China with mesmerizing images of Chan and Smith climbing the Wudang Mountains and Smith going on a school trip inside the Forbidden City. Movie Information The Karate KidRatingShowtimes | Official siteDirector Harald ZwartStarring Jackie Chan Jaden Smith and Taraji P. HensonRun time 139 minutesMPAA rating PG (bullying martial-arts action violence and some mild language)Synopsis A 12-year-old transplant to China - played by Will Smiths son Jaden - learns how to stand up to bullies.More movies from GuideLive.comBut parents who grew up on the magic of Robert Mark Kamens original script may wince at screenwriter Christopher Murpheys tone-deaf emotional choices in freshening up the story.The film opens with Dres mother (Taraji P. Henson) packing up for a new job in China as Dre says goodbye to his old home in Detroit complete with a line scratched on the wall noting when his father died. No mention of his father is made again by Dre and not at all by the relentlessly chirpy mom.Mr. Han has a secret too much as Mr. Miyagi had. When it is revealed here it is about a pain that one cannot imagine being healed or even soothed by any amount of martial-arts practice. There is even a reworking of the originals classic ""wax on wax off"" scene as a ""jacket on jacket off"" scene in which Dre is asked to do a repetitive task that he does not initially understand - but it doesnt yield the same punch.The new Karate Kid does improve on the original in both visuals and sounds with its riveting kung fu moves and lingering attention to the natural beauties of Chinas landscape culture and deep reverence for exquisitely played music. Its exciting to see the Charismatic Kid Jaden Smith charm in his first starring role with many more to come no doubt.More than anything it may boost the DVD sales of the original as parents leaving the theater suddenly feel a hunger for the emotional resonance of the original grittier but ultimately more satisfying tale of an ordinary kid who with the help of his teacher finds he has an extraordinary ability to prevail. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

"Movie Review The Karate Kid an old plot with new punch washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments The Karate Kid Movie Review The Karate Kid an old plot with new punch Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 11 2010 Between ""The A-Team"" and ""The Karate Kid"" it must be ""We Love the 80s"" week at the multiplex. But if you rolled your eyes when you heard about the remake of the 1984 hit that starred Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita get ready for a surprise. The new ""Karate Kid"" brings fresh life and perspective to the classic tale of perseverance and cross-generational friendship thanks to Harald Zwarts sensitive direction and two exceptionally appealing stars. This StoryThe Karate Kid This old plot has new punchFind The Karate Kid showtimesWatch the trailerThe A-Team and The Karate Kid out (again) for kicksView All Items in This StoryView Only Top Items in This Story Speaking of eye-rollers not a few cynics grumbled when they heard that Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith were bankrolling ""The Karate Kid"" as a vehicle for their son Jaden. But the serenely self-possessed 11-year-old while at times uncannily resembling his father manages to carve out a screen persona all his own. As Dre Parker who with his mother Sherry (Taraji P. Henson) has just moved to Beijing from Detroit he brings a soulful searching sense of vulnerability to a kid who comes under attack from bullies on his first day in town. After a particularly brutal beat-down Dre is defended by his apartment house caretaker a quiet introvert named Mr. Han (Jackie Chan). When Han -- who turns out to be a kung fu master -- goes up against the crumbums who have been terrorizing Dre he does so largely with defensive moves that wind up literally tying the belligerents into knots. Thus does ""The Karate Kid"" honor the ancient Hollywood art of serving up bone-crushing violence with enlightenment on the side Though the filmmakers invite viewers to wince and cheer during the films increasingly painful fight scenes they make sure to soften the blows with wise tutorials in self-discipline respect and balance. Zwart makes the most of the verdant misty locations in China where ""The Karate Kid"" was filmed including the Forbidden City and the Great Wall. The result is a handsome movie that delivers playful nods to its predecessor. Like Moritas original character Mr. Han tries to catch a fly with his chopsticks but isnt above using a swatter; later he drills Dre in hanging up his jacket in a sequence based on the famous ""wax on wax off"" scenes in the 1984 film. Still this version looks and feels surprisingly new. Wisely Chan underplays his natural warmth for a character whose terseness and eccentric behavior are explained in one of the movies rare sagging moments. But the real revelation is Smith who made his screen debut with his father in ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" and here proves that hes no mere beneficiary of dynastic largesse. Somber self-contained and somehow believable as a kid for whom things dont come easily he never conveys the sense that hes desperate to be liked. Which is precisely why ""The Karate Kid"" winds up being so likable itself.  PG. At area theaters. Contains bullying martial-arts action violence and some mild profanity. 132 minutes. >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments (c) 2010 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  This old plot has new punch Find The Karate Kid showtimes The A-Team and The Karate Kid out (again) for kicks Watch the trailer",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/10/AR2010061001618.html,200,thekaratekid9,thekaratekid,washingtonpost

Photo A popcorn picture that thinks its ""The Last Emperor"" ""The Karate Kid"" is about as likely to grab your youngsters attention as any other propaganda film made by the Chinese government. The remake of the 1984 movie is a dreary tale of a Detroit kid (Will Smiths son Jaden) whose mother (Taraji P. Henson) is sent by an auto company to work in Beijing. There arent many elements to this story and we already know what theyre going to be -- bullies girl teacher training tournament -- yet every one of them goes as swiftly as performing the breaststroke in wet cement. Norwegian director Harald Zwart really puts the slo in Oslo. His picture is destined to be shown on the New York to Beijing flight and itll almost be over by the time the plane lands. It isnt even about karate but kung fu which the lad learns from the super (Jackie Chan) of his apartment building. Chan mopes around mysteriously and even gets to go nuts in a Big Dramatic Scene (tm) designed to put him in Pat Moritas footsteps to an Oscar nod. Aint gonna happen. PHOTOS BIG-SCREEN REMAKES The kid Dre flirts up a taller cute girl (Wenwen Han) in his new school and the two spend much of the movie scampering around Beijing Tourist Board locations like the Forbidden City as if the average 12-year-old will care. Ive been to China and trust me Smoke six packs of unfiltered Luckys while strolling down Mott Street and youll get the gist. The toxic gray bouillabaisse that Beijing folk call ""air"" and try to force into their lungs (frequently through surgical masks) is nowhere referred to because Chinas state-run film agency co-produced the film. Moreover the kids are so young (Smith is 11) that their relationship is just a cute friendship not a real romance and though her dad briefly forbids her to see Dre there isnt a real conflict here just a point of custom. That a tradition-soaked Chinese dad might not be thrilled by the idea of his daughter dating a black kid or an American is also not brought up. Theres nothing wrong with the story -- but theres nothing fresh about it either and the climax is a virtual replay of the one in the 1984 version. Moreover the ""Rocky"" model was only 8 years old when Ralph Macchio tied on the black belt. Now -- a quarter-century of underdog sports movies later -- would be the perfect time to find some new approach. Instead we get a few in-jokey references to the first film (only one of which involving chopsticks is actually witty) and a lot of discount-Eastern-epigrams ""No such thing as bad students. Only bad teacher"" and ""Life will knock us down. But we can choose whether or not to get back up."" Where is the fun? Zwarts poky direction offers no flash not even cheap Michael Bay tactics to mask the flaws of a thin script. (We learn virtually nothing about the mom except that she seems like a nice lady or about the bully except that his teacher is mean.) Director and script work very much to the disadvantage of the lead actor who to put it kindly would not yet be considered leading-man material were it not for his father who is also a producer of the film. I cant imagine what it might be like to be the son of the biggest movie star in the world but it would appear that such an experience doesnt exactly stuff you with humility. Young Smith comes across as petulant rude and entitled especially when his mom keeps telling him to pick up his clothes and he keeps refusing. You dont exactly root for the bullies to stomp Dre but nor are you overcome by outrage when they do. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next DC home run Read Next DC home run Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 36605 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 18975 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 18509 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

(Jasin Boland) Joe Neumaier Thursday June 10 2010 538 PM Title Karate Kid In this weekends battle of the 80s do-overs the remake of ""The Karate Kid"" may not beat ""The A-Teams"" punch but at least it has heart and a good kick.Yet this family movie pays its own price including a sluggish pace and a tendency to fill its familiar story with too much forced grandeur.As in the 1984 original which starred a dweeby Ralph Macchio and an Oscar-nominated Noriyuki (Pat) Morita the story begins with dislocation. Here 12-year-old Dre Parker (Jaden Smith son of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith) moves from Detroit to Beijing when his mother (Taraji P. Henson) gets a job transfer and soon finds himself the target of a school bully and his gang.To defend himself he seeks out his buildings maintenance man Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) and asks if he can teach him kung fu -- not karate as his mother calls it apparently just to keep the franchise name going. The gruff Han is the solitary sort though and wont be drawn. Only after Dre is challenged to a tournament by his antagonists and their coach insults Han do the two begin instruction starting with the idea that ""kung fu is about everything.""Director Harald Zwart (""The Pink Panther 2"") lets the movies serene pace echo Hans methodical instructions which works until it gets wearying. Still Dres ""aha"" moment of physical discipline is undeniably energizing. (Rather than ""Wax on wax off"" Dre learns the importance of ""Jacket on jacket off."")Given the focus on kung fu Chan works here since except for a scene in which Hans back story is revealed hes needed more for sweetness than drama. And since everyone is younger than in the original Hans disposing of Dres middle-school tormenters is less awkward due to Chans signature martial-arts style He uses the kids energy against them turning their coats into a net.But Chans shuffling stoop-shouldered gait too often seems too comical -- a tactical mistake.As for Smith given his beautiful and charismatic parents its no surprise the camera loves him and he certainly has presence. The problem is too often the young actor (whose biggest role previously was opposite his dad in ""The Pursuit of Happyness"") is required to do too much from wooing a girl while earning his kung fu chops to learning Eastern ways and conveying conflicting emotions. Smith can handle what the film throws at him and he and Chan nail the life-lesson parts. Yet like the way Han kills a fly with a swatter instead of catching it with chopsticks the film replaces finesse with hit-you-over-the-head might.         jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"The Karate Kid movie review This Kid is all right |       NJ.com comments The Karate Kid movie review This Kid is all right Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on June 11 2010 at 1212 AM View/Post Comments Columbia PicturesJackie Chan as Mr. Han and Jaden Smith as Dre Parker in Columbia Pictures ""The Karate Kid.""Lets get this out of the way first. Yes its called ""The Karate Kid."" Its based on an earlier movie called ""The Karate Kid."" It even shows a brief clip of its young hero watching a karate video to try and justify the title. But ""The Karate Kid"" is about kung-fu okay? Set in the kung-fu capital of the world China. With the worlds biggest living kung-fu star. With everything climaxing in a giant kung-fu tournament. So so much for truth in advertising. The Karate Kid (PG) Columbia (132 min.) Directed by Harald Zwart. With Jackie Chan Jaden Smith. Now playing in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys rating Three stars Rating note The film contains a lot of bloodless violence. What ""The Karate Kid"" is honest about though is in giving its audience exactly what its buying tickets for -- a middle-school martial-arts ""Rocky"" with a plucky underdog finally winning big. And it does that very well. Admittedly this is not a movie with huge ambitions. But neither -- like say ""Prince of Persia"" -- is it pretending to be for older or hipper audiences than it is. Its a kids movie aimed at kids and the people who buy their tickets. And on that level it doesnt disappoint. At least not judging by the small boy -- Im guessing a kindergartener -- who sat near me at a recent screening. ""Why are they picking on him"" he asked his mom when the bullies first attacked our young hero. ""Yay"" he shouted clapping when an old man jumped into the fight. I confess it was tempting to watch him instead of the movie. He was just as much fun. If Id done that though Id missed some modest but dependable pleasures. Like Jaden Smith son of Will and with some of his old mans limber grace and easy mischief as the Kid. Or the always wonderful Taraji P. Henson as his indomitable mother. In this version Mom leaves Detroit to take a job in a Chinese auto factory -- a painful topical twist. There her fatherless boy soon becomes the target of some martially skilled bullies. Cue Jackie Chan their apartment complexs handyman and apparently the best martial artist since -- well Jackie Chan. Who after taking on half-a-dozen thugs singlehandedly -- and the usual slow winning-over by the titular Kid -- decides to teach the boy kung fu. Wax on wax off? Well no that gimmick from the first film isnt here. (Neither by the way is Ralph Macchio.) But the new version adds lots of pretty travelogue pictures of the Great Wall and the Olympic stadium. And a little bit of fantasy and Eastern mysticism too. Some of that could have been ditched along with a bit of its cute-tween romance with a Chinese music student. (Some of it has been ditched too -- the movies been cut since its first screening leaving some continuity confusion.) But the film still delivers. At least judging by that small fan who several minutes before the end began weeping when it seemed as if the badly injured Karate Kid wouldnt be able to compete in the final match. Even his mother couldnt console him. Really champ I wanted to say what is this? Your first movie? Well maybe. But definitely not his last. Because within a few minutes hed had his first real taste of all the cheesy satisfaction a shameless crowd-pleaser like this can deliver. And he was cheering again.

"The Karate Kid No kidding around in violent remake | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Karate Kid No kidding around in violent remakeIn this remake of the 1984 ""Rocky for kids"" drama violence against children is a greater concern than before.Jaden Smith in The Karate Kid  (SUBMITTED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. June 10 2010The Karate Kid (out of 4)Starring Jackie Chan Jaden Smith and Taraji P. Henson. Directed by Harald Zwart. 140 minutes. At major theatres. PGIn the innocence of the 1980s -- and they were that way werent they? -- it was enough for The Karate Kid to just be a small picture that grabbed a big audience. Ralph Macchios bullied schoolboy found his feet and his focus from Pat Moritas humble karate guru and recess was never the same again -- at least until a succession of increasingly witless sequels chopped the franchise down to size.Article Continued BelowNow comes the millennial reboot and so much more is riding upon the slim shoulders of our teachable victim now played by Jaden Smith the 11-year-old son of doting Hollywood parents Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith.So desperate are the Smiths to have Jaden join the family firm theyve shoe-horned him into a role requiring dramatic comedic and romantic chops that are beyond his slim abilities. Young Jaden was fine as his dads son in The Pursuit of Happyness which required no feat of credulity or serious screen time. Hes woefully out of his league here -- especially as The Karate Kid indulgently runs 2 hours 20 minutes at least a half hour more than it needs while delivering less fun and inspiration than before.Theres also the major issue of Jadens minor age and size both of which are lacking heft. The considerably bigger Macchio was 23 when the original movie was released but his boyish looks made him look years younger. Jackie Chan assumes Moritas spry sage of a handyman/teacher now called Mr. Han and the casting here is also wrong but from an opposite direction. The likeable Chan is too qualified for this role since everybody knows hes capable of bringing the pain when the kung-fu (not karate) begins. Robbed of the original films surprise reveal of the gurus skills and the reason for the mysterious repetitive tasks he demands (now its hanging a coat on a hook over and over) we know its just a matter of marking time -- lots of it -- before the fists and feet start flying. The picture is also saddled with crass tourism. This remake is partially funded by Chinese production money enough to necessitate a shift from California to Beijing. Much of the film involves trips to such scenic landmarks as the Great Wall and the Forbidden City which are nice to see but leave the story feeling punch-drunk. Director Harald Zwart (The Pink Panther 2) and pen-for-hire Christopher Murphey have barely changed the original screenplay apart from a trans-global location shift. But this may be a hidden blessing because the basic story is strong enough to survive even a half-baked remake like this.Jadens Dre Parker moves from Detroit to Beijing with his mother Sherry (Taraji P. Henson a definite plus) to start new lives following the death of Dres father.Dre tries to fit in at school even though hes considered an oddity being the only African-American in class. When he makes friends with a shy violin player named Meiying (Wenwen Han) he draws unwelcome attention from a gang led by school bully Cheng (Zhenwei Wang). Dre tries to defend himself but hes outnumbered and left in the dirt by Chengs gang who fight hard and dirty. He later learns that Cheng has been studying a particularly brutal form of kung-fu taught by a sociopath named Master Li (Yu Rongguang Yu) who tells his young charges ""No weakness no pain no mercy.""You already know or can guess what happens next. Mr. Han teaches Dre to use kung-fu both in self defense and as a life motivator (""Everything is kung-fu"") as they prepare for a tournament match against Cheng that promises and delivers third-act fireworks.Its possible to enjoy The Karate Kid as a simple if too long story of self realization one that by rights should have been called The Kung-Fu Kid were it not for the profitable franchise name.Im troubled however but the large amount of violence practiced by and directed against kids who have barely reached puberty -- the body slams and bone crunches seem all too real. You really do wonder whether to cheer or to contact child welfare authorities.

A classic yes but nothing like the clumsy dehumanized spectacles that have come to dominate the multiplexes during the summer months. Debra Graniks drama a big winner at this years Sundance Film Festival is spectacular for its humanity austere beauty and heart-stopping urgency. The setting is the Ozark mountains of southwestern Missouri at the present time though many of the faces might have been photographed by Dorothea Lange or for that matter Matthew Brady and the themes are timeless--love kinship the struggle to survive. The 17-year-old heroine Ree Dolly is played by Jennifer Lawrence a professional actress who doesnt seem to act so much as achieve a state of grace that combines intelligence with fierce resolve. And ferocity is required of Ree since she is the only one who can keep disaster from her familys door. ENLARGE Ashlee Thompson Jennifer Lawrence and Isaiah Stone in Winters Bone. Roadside Attractions Her task is to find Jessup Dolly her crank-cooking no-account fugitive of a father. If she fails as seems likely the marshals will evict her her young brother and sister and their blank-faced mother from the cabin that Jessup put up for bond at his trial before vanishing without a trace. The plot is plainly old-fashioned though no more anachronistic than Rees rural hardscrabble surroundings. Michael McDonoughs searching camera reminds us that we Americans live along many different time streams. On this one which flows directly from the Great Depression poverty remains so entrenched that the local small-business model is a meth lab and two prospects for postgraduate life are reflected in afternoon programs at Rees high school parenting classes and ROTC drills. Until now Ive made ""Winters Bone"" sound more like an object of admiration than the source of deep pleasure that it is but only because I dont want to soften its sharp edges. The director who worked with Anne Rosellini on adapting Daniel Woodrells novel has explored the Ozark culture without condescension or sentimentality. Her film is populated by explosive often brutal men with guns and their submissive often frightened women. Pride prevents Ree from asking for desperately needed food. (""Never ask for what ought to be offered"" she tells her little brother.) Her neighbors code of silence smothers her inquiries. (""Talking just causes witnesses"" a steely-eyed harridan tells her.) Kindness is in short supply and her quest grows ever more lonely as she penetrates the heart of her fathers personal darkness. So where does the pleasure come in? At just about every moment Ree is on screen. When shes teaching her brother and sister to shoot squirrels for food. (""You guys want these fried or stewed?"") When she confides however cautiously in an Army recruiter. (In a film thats full of surprises the recruiter is one of many minor characters who merit attention.) When she finds the courage to speak her mind. (""You have always scared me"" she tells her uncle Teardrop who is played with hair-trigger brilliance by John Hawkes. ""Thats cause youre smart"" he replies.) She is very smart as well as fearless up to a point though fearfully vulnerable. Ree is a thrilling heroine so old-fashioned that shes new and Ms. Lawrence gives her the sort of rock-solid yet poetic quality that recalls ""The Grapes of Wrath"" or the neo-realist films from Europe following World War II. The filmmaker Ms. Granik dealt with the grim realities of drug addiction in her debut feature ""Down to the Bone."" (What to make of all dem bones?) Her new film far from being a downer makes its way through harshness and hardship into hope. The Karate Kid ""Its like were brave pioneers on a quest to start a magical life in a new land"" the kids mother announces overbrightly in ""The Karate Kid"" just before they leave Detroit for Beijing. ""You could say that"" her son mutters with corrective cool. You could also say its like theyre likable tourists on a quest to plunder an endearing movie that didnt need this mediocre remake. The kid no longer Daniel but Dre is played by Jaden Smith the touchingly tender delicate-featured son of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith. (His mom is played by Teraji P. Henson.) The boy looks much younger than his 12 years; hes in a league of his own--a little league--compared to Ralph Macchio who was in his early 20s when he played the kid as a sturdy teenager. Size matters here. Its appalling to watch Dre being battered bruised and borderline-brutalized by Chinese counterparts of the original toughs (who this time practice a World Wrestling Entertainment variant of kung fu rather than a Rocky version of karate). The pall doesnt cover the rest of the movie. Jaden is endearing in his own way and the abstract notion of Jackie Chan in Pat Moritas role of the wise mentor almost obscures the reality of Mr. Chans zonked performance which simulates warm feelings toward the kid without risk of infectiousness. ENLARGE Bradley Cooper and Liam Neeson in The A-Team. Twentieth Century Fox The A-Team Liam Neesons Hannibal the bemuscled but seldom bemused master planner of ""The A-Team"" keeps insisting on his belief in an invisible order ""No matter how random things may appear theres a plan in everything."" Hes obviously right. In the absence of a coherent script (or in the presence of a script that like quantum mechanics puts a premium on randomness) the plan for this big-screen version of the cheerful old TV series could hardly be clearer--lay down an almost ceaseless barrage of thunderous action turn up the sensory heat for summer audiences whove taken refuge in the multiplex cold. Watch a scene from ""The A-Team"" starring Liam Neeson as Hannibal Bradley Cooper as Face Sharto Copley as Murdock and Quinton Rampage Jackson as B.A. Baracus. Video courtesy 20th Century Fox. Mr. Neeson gives the movie as much gravitas as he can without provoking giggles. Of the actors playing the other members of the team the only one with a world-class performance in his resume is Sharlto Copley the star of ""District 9."" He plays Murdock the crackpot pilot and gets to do barrel-rolls in a C-130 transport but thats about it. If youre looking for logic or finesse ""The A-Team"" can be numbing. If youre looking for good cheer hold out for egg nog at Christmas. But if youre a fan of causeless effects consequence-free causes and digital Dada let the silly times roll. Joan Rivers A Piece of Work Who would have guessed that ""Joan Rivers A Piece of Work"" would turn out to be a stirring portrait of indomitability? I thought I knew as much as I needed to know about an entertainer whos been on stage for four decades and resisted seeing this fine documentary by Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg. Yet here the filmmakers find her at the age of 75 a foulmouthed Mrs. Sisyphus pushing ever onward and occasionally upward in a world transfixed by youth and beauty. Once she was wild for the times. Her closing line she recalls used to be ""Im Joan Rivers and I put out."" Now she holds out with defiant energy and an almost maniacal focus against the encroachments of old age personal loss and dwindling bookings. (Which suddenly undwindled with a vengeance when she prevailed in of all potentially demeaning things ""Celebrity Apprentice."") Demeaning doesnt belong in her vocabulary. She could not be more candid about her willingness to accept any work that pays. Part of that is fueled by economics; shes determined to remain in the lap of luxury which includes a New York apartment that in her words ""is how Marie Antoinette would have lived if shed had money."" (I also thought I wouldnt be laughing at her jokes many of which turn out to be fresh and terrific.) But mostly shes a creature of implacable incurable and endlessly nourishing anger--at NBC and Johnny Carson who befriended and then she says betrayed her when she produced an ill-fated talk show of her own on Fox; at critics who wont give her what she wants the most validation as an actress; at the march of time and its ominous drumbeat. Sometimes her laughs are mirthless and you wonder what shes thinking. What she thinks of herself though seems perfectly if improbably reasonable--a queen of comedy who wont and shouldnt abdicate. Gangsters Paradise In South Africa where ""Gangsters Paradise"" was made the film was originally called ""Jerusalema""--a violent hymn heavy with irony to the new Jerusalem that was promised but not delivered by the nations postapartheid governments. Theres nothing heavy however about Ralph Zimans nimble and electrifying chronicle of Lucky Kunene an ardent good-hearted kid growing up to be a charismatic community organizer and then a gang boss. Lucky whos played with huge elan by Rapula Seiphemo takes inspiration where he can find it from sages as diverse as Karl Marx Al Capone and Donald Trump and from fragrant phrases like affirmative repossession a local euphemism for carjacking. The movie repossesses just as affirmatively a host of Hollywood conventions from such films as ""Scarface"" ""The Godfather"" and ""Heat."" Yet the results are startlingly original if occasionally overambitious. This is ""Tsotsi"" without the feel-good glow a tale of entrepreneurships perils and boundless pleasures.

"Movie review The Karate Kid - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Martial ArtsMovie review The Karate KidIt has kick from Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan but its running time may test its target audiences patience.June 11 2010|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""The Karate Kid"" is a kung fu kick of a film that hits more than it misses with its fresh prince of Beijing in Jaden Smith its scene-stealing grand master flash Jackie Chan and a shiny-happy China travelogue thrown in for good measure or tax incentives one of the two. The grit and the grime of the 1984 original are gone swept under some Oriental rug no doubt in the spit-shine director Harald Zwart has given every nook and cranny of the production. But the bones of Robert Mark Kamens story of a struggling fatherless boy and the man and martial arts that help him is still very much the heart of the matter a screenwriter Christopher Murpheys just gone global with it. Though the new job takes mom the always sassy Taraji P. Henson and Dre (Smith) to kung fu central the producers have kept the ""Karate"" name and thrown in some bad dialogue to explain it. For the record and for all the parents left to search for classes the kids will probably clamor for the highly choreographed fighting style used here is wushu a kind of power kung fu that frankly looks pretty brutal so be prepared for the kids to give and take a lot of punches. Giving the movie even more currency today is its key dilemma of how to deal with the school bully. While cyber-bullying has become all the rage for most kids reality is that bigger boy with a bad attitude who pushes and pummels them on the playground. For Dre its Cheng (Zhenwei Wang) who doesnt like the new American interloper or his interest in pretty violin prodigy Mei Ying (Wenwen Han). A few losing rounds with the Cheng gang sends Dre on his journey to find himself honor and an enemy-crushing kick with help from Chans Mr. Han and plenty of nods to the original that fans will recognize along the way. The critical piece of this Chinese puzzle is Mr. Han the maintenance man at Dres apartment house and a secret kung fu master. Its a wonderfully nuanced performance with Chan hiding the pain of old wounds in the dark recesses of his eyes moving with an old warriors limp that would make House envious. Though he masters and mines Mr. Hans interior there is great fun in his face-off with the young toughs who are after Dre which channels the battle magic that has made him a martial arts movie legend. Meanwhile Smith is a chip off the old charismatic block of daddy Will (he and mom Jada are producers on the film). The 11-year-old has a few credits under his black belt most prominently playing his fathers son in ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" but ""Karate Kid"" is his first starring role and the film hangs largely on his slight shoulders. Smith is surprisingly at ease with the more emotional notes a real tears after Chengs well-aimed blows to both his body and his ego. He trained for months with Wu Gang the stunt coordinator for Chans martial arts team as well and that athleticism is much on display. As is kung fu itself from the school where kids stand hundreds strong in their red gis ready to take the day to the final showdown between Dre and Cheng in front of a roaring crowd a complex series of scenes that Chans team stepped in to choreograph. The endgame a whether you kung fu for peace or to destroy a is once again on trial along with Dre. But first Dre must learn to be a patient grasshopper picking up his jacket off the floor about a million times which turns out to be the foundation for some of those nifty moves Mr. Han has up his sleeve. Speaking of patience sitting through ""The Karate Kid"" at well over 2 hours requires more than some of its target audience will have to say nothing of their minders who may consider revolt when everyone heads to the Qi Xi Festival one of several unnecessary side trips. The pacing is problematic swinging between the blinding speed and bruising reality of the fights and a meandering sightseeing tour of China that takes Dre and Mr. Han from training on The Great Wall to the Forbidden City to a mountain retreat. Director of photography Roger Pratt with a couple of Harry Potters on his long resume captures the vast landscape and the historic landmarks of the country and the intimate sweat-pouring intensity of the fights though its sometimes jarring as we move between them. For director Zwart whose last outing was the depressingly bad ""Pink Panther 2"" its a step up. The filmmaker has a good eye for action but he remains too tentative with both the story and his actors particularly the kids and the movie gets away from him at times. Thankfully Chan is usually there to save the day with Smith a worthy student right beside him. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMovie review ShaolinSeptember 9 2011Jaden Smith shows acting chops in aKarate Kida remakeMay 2 2010Jackie Chan in The Spy Next DoorJanuary 14 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTMartial ArtsJackie ChanKung FuKarate KidCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-karate-kid-20100611,0,800324.story",200,thekaratekid16,thekaratekid,latimes

Star Tribune film critic Colin Covert lists them for you. Shari Gross Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Lets put the shortcomings of the new ""Karate Kid"" in perspective. The 1984 original directed by Oscar-winner John G. Avildsen (""Rocky"") was hardly a cultural treasure. It was wildly implausible and corny but if it hit you at the right point in your underdoggy adolescence it generated warm memories. The remake is equally farfetched but lacks the innocence that made the first film so likable. The new ""Kid"" feels like a big-budget audition reel for sweet miscast Jaden Smith with Will and Jada Pinkett Smith hovering above the bloated 135-minute project as doting parents/producers. A storm cloud of calculation overhangs the whole enterprise. The film follows 12-year-old Dre Parker (Smith) and his single mother Sherry (Taraji P. Henson) on a job transfer from decaying Detroit to vibrant Beijing. Dres transition is complicated by his lazy disrespectful nature his crush on his Chinese classmate Meiying (Wenwen Han) and vicious bullying by schoolyard thug Chen (Zhenwei Wang) and his henchmen. Dre begs his mom to enroll him in a kung fu academy for self-defense but finds an unlikely mentor in his apartments laconic handyman Mr. Han (Jackie Chan). In the course of many training montages he drops his bratty attitude absorbs a dose of Buddhist humility and learns to stand up for himself. Smith is a cute kid but fundamentally wrong for the role. The protagonist in the original film was in his mid-teens a young man in the making. Here prepubescent seventh-graders enact heart-thumping romance and bone-thumping beat-downs which makes for uncomfortable viewing. Ironically Smith radiates a self-possessed confidence that makes him seem less vulnerable than his puppyish predecessor Ralph Macchio. The little leading man has a couple of scenes here where he weeps with a doe-eyed professionalism that verges on the robotic. Hes impressively agile in his endless training scenes but his acting muscles are not so limber. His mushy kissing scene with his girlfriend looks more painful than the endless walloping he gets from the brutish Chen. Jasin Boland Columbia Pictures Jaden Smith stars as ""The Karate Kid."" And what about Jackie Chan? He is stuck with some Zen howlers explaining how kung fu is like life. His tragic back story like the films needless excursions to the Forbidden City and the Great Wall really ought to have been saved as DVD extras. Chan is playing an older wearier character here and his shambling body language is persuasive. Either he nailed this duffers physicality or all those stunt injuries are finally catching up with him. The climactic scene the standing-room-only little league kung fu championship is a numbing flurry of fast cutting ear-bruising sound effects and spinning crane kicks. Director Harald Zwart (""The Pink Panther 2"") is better at drawing out the tension before the bouts when the opponents eye one another warily. The David-and-Goliath mismatch plays out as it must but its hard to shout approval for pint-sized lads clobbering each other. The recent superhero spoof ""Kick-Ass"" had the wit to turn that kind of child abuse imagery into a grand sick joke. ""The Karate Kid"" invites us to cheer the spectacle for real and even when the good guy triumphs that spoils the fun.

ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Karate Kid   (out of four) Stars Jaden Smith Jackie Chan Taraji P. Henson Wenwen Han Rongguang YuDirector Harald ZwartDistributorColumbia PicturesRating PG for bullying martial arts action violence and some mild languageRunning time 2 hours 20 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The Karate Kidis surprisingly sure-footed and deft in its new setting. While faithful in spirit to the modest 1984 original this bigger-budget remake occasionally goes too far in its aim to be more epic. But the chemistry between Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan grounds the movie imbuing it with sincerity and poignance. TRAILER Preview The Karate Kid Smith is a charming and natural young actor. Hes consistently charismatic in the role of young Dre Parker who moves from Detroit to Beijing when his mother (Taraji P. Henson) gets a job transfer. Smith the son of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith got his start acting with his father in 2006s The Pursuit of Happyness. He has a strong presence and notable ease on screen conveying a youthful version of his fathers cheeky affability. The ever-likable Chan plays Mr. Han a maintenance man and former kung fu master who becomes a mentor for Dre a slight 12-year-old picked on by local thugs led by the scowling Cheng (Wang Zhenwei). Han intercedes as half a dozen boys descend on Dre then agrees to instruct him in martial arts. Of course the lessons the somber Han imparts are about focus and inner strength as much as about fighting moves. Han more melancholy than Pat Moritas Mr. Miyagi learns about resilience from Dre just as the boy attains newfound confidence from Han. The film takes advantage of its exotic setting and places Dre and Han in some stunning locations including the dramatic Wudang Mountains and at the Great Wall. A snarling and villainous kung fu instructor (Rongguang Yu) whose credo is ""No Mercy"" encourages Cheng to break Dres leg. His vengeance toward a child seems misplaced. The gut punches and body slams feel almost too grittily visceral given that the participants are barely adolescents. Scenes in which Dre is viciously pummeled -- only to jump up and deliver dazzling kicks and chops -- are particularly far-fetched. Dre is struggling in the foreign surroundings. When Dres frustration finally erupts Smith believably conveys youthful angst. The film digs a little deeper emotionally than the original which starred Ralph Macchio in the karate student role. At nearly 21/2 hours however its padded with training montages and a stilted romance. The final tournament goes overboard in its effort to establish suspense. But even with these flaws the film is solidly entertaining mostly because of the endearing performances of Smith and Chan and its atmosphere of cross-cultural celebration.

Thats the hook of The Karate Kid an appealing reboot of the 1984 inspirational that rethinks the American tale for the global age.Its star Jaden Smith spawn of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett is clearly a winner in the genetic sweepstakes. Hes inherited Daddys charm and Dumbo ears and Moms looks and terrier tenacity.These attributes serve him nicely in the movie about the new kid who faces down bullies with the help of a martial-arts master. That the master in question is Jackie Chan the one person on the planet radiating even more positive energy than Will and Jaden means that the films charisma quotient is off the charts.In the update the setting is not Los Angeles but Beijing and the self-defense technique not karate but kung fu. Why not The Kung Fu Kid? Because in Hollywood the brand trumps accuracy-in-titling.As the film opens Dre Parker (Smith) a wiry 12-year-old and his mother Sherry (Taraji P. Henson whose sunbeam smile warms the film) pack up their Detroit apartment and head for Beijing. They leave behind the penciled scrawls on the bedroom-door frame marking Dres growth along with corresponding events from his soccer wins to his fathers recent passing.Smith so cuddly as the young boy in The Pursuit of Happyness is suitably prickly as the forlorn tween terrified of an unknown country and an unknown language.As soon as Dre and his mother arrive in Beijing he is slammed by the cultural differences. During a pickup basketball game Dre learns that the American values of diversity and individual achievement are not shared in a nation that prizes teamwork.When the youth chats up Meiying (Wenwen Han) a fetching violinist practicing on a park bench her schoolmate Cheng (Zhenwei Wang) thrashes the American interloper. Naturally Meiying and Cheng attend the American school where Dres mom has enrolled him.While Meiying helps Dre with Mandarin and chopsticks Cheng and his posse do everything they can to terrorize him. One afternoon Dres bacon is saved by Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) a grizzled janitor who like a slugger swatting dingers swiftly dispatches the preteen assailants one by one. To avoid future reprisals from the bullies Dre must face his enemies at a kung fu contest.The bullies train at a dojo under the gimlet eye of a kung fu militant whose motto is ""no pain no mercy no fear."" Dre trains with Mr. Han who believes martial arts are not for conducting war but for making peace. As in the original The Karate Kid the masters lessons are oblique. Through repetition of a seemingly unrelated task Dre internalizes kung fu rudiments without realizing it.With key sequences filmed in the Forbidden City and at the Great Wall of China filmmaker Harald Zwart directs with an eye for the picturesque and for the symmetry of the fatherless son and childless father figure.The kung fu sequences although enjoyable probably would not make the Jackie Chan Top 10. However Chans acting is his most affecting since the 1993 policer Crime Story.From Chan Zwart elicits a subdued performance of surprising grace - surprising because Han resembles a rag doll droopy and shabby and fights with muscular elegance. From Smith he distills the essence of the novices desire to become more adept. Thus it is ideal for Smith who according to press accounts is making his way as an actor and performed his own stunts here.Although it is overlong (two hours-plus) this Kid is a winner in more ways than one.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Lets be honest The original ""Karate Kid is not a great movie. Effective yes; enshrined in the hearts of a zillion Gen-Xers as a filmic foundation myth certainly. Say ""wax on to a group of late 30-somethings and watch them answer ""wax off in happy Pavlovian unison. If youve seen it lately though ""Kid shows its age thanks to John Avildsens crude direction the absurd overacting of everyone except the central duo of student and master and rampant 80s bad-hair syndrome. The movie works but the notion of a remake is far from heresy.In fact the people behind the new ""Karate Kid have had the good sense to keep what works -- that triumphant underdog story retraced here to the scene and sometimes to the dialogue -- while changing everything around it. Most crucially the entire production has been airlifted to China with the result that the audience feels its young heros fish-out-of-water dilemma far more sharply. The one thing that should have been changed but hasnt is the title which makes no sense at all in a movie about kung fu. But try telling that to the studio marketing department.Leading the cast is Jaden Smith the 11-year-old son of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith. Weve seen him before -- playing affectingly with his dad in ""The Pursuit of Happyness -- but he carries this oversize production ably and almost solely on his small shoulders. I have no idea whether Smith 2.0 has the makings of an actor but he conveys the hopes and fears of an actual kid and that goes a long way toward grounding ""Karate Kid in a naturalism it needs.His character Dre Parker has just moved from Detroit to Beijing -- mom (Taraji P. Henson easily outpacing Randee Heller from the 1984 version) has been relocated by her employer -- and lands in this new world speaking barely a word of Mandarin. Lucky for him and the movie that most of the Chinese kids also speak English; unlucky that they include Cheng (Zhenwei Wang) a baby-faced bully who with his toadies shuts Dre down within minutes of his arrival. As in the first movie that opening fight is a classic Charles Atlas sand-in-your-face humiliation complete with appalled teen love interest (Wenwen Han) whimpering on the sidelines.A few more kicks to the head and Dre is a prime candidate for a kung fu makeover courtesy of his buildings super Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) a reclusive loner with martial arts skills like well Jackie Chans. Except for one very funny donnybrook in an alley -- Mr. Han defeats the bullies by beating them up with their own fists -- Chan forgoes the high-velocity comedy hes famous for and plays the character fairly straight. The wit is still there of course in workout sequences that have Dre repeatedly hanging his jacket up for what seems like several months. This ""Karate Kid shares with the original a belief in miracles that can transform a newbie to a black belt in a few well-edited training montages.Director Harald Zwart has ""The Pink Panther 2 to his credit for which he will never nor should ever be forgiven but he keeps this one moving smoothly and he uses the Chinese locations well. There are a few too many tourist shots and one egregious sequence set atop the Great Wall but mostly Dre and his dramas unfold in a living breathing city. ""The Karate Kid has been made with a lot of overseas production money and its aimed with unusual frankness at a global audience to the extent that the final credits are in both English and Chinese. (Interestingly its also the rare Hollywood blockbuster with no white people in it other than Luke Carberry as a briefly seen friend of Dres.)Sticking closely to the original means the new ""Kid is an unnecessary 132 minutes long and the final razzle-dazzle tournament scenes are stretched for maximum suspense. Theyre more violent than before too while featuring characters several years younger than in the first film; theres a brutality at the edges of the remake that the filmmakers dont fully own up to.On the other hand why mess with a foolproof formula? At the end of ""The Karate Kid the preview audience with whom I saw the film stood and cheered with the fervor of new converts. You could almost be forgiven for thinking it was 1984 all over again.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation.

Share Tweet Some remakes update or reimagine others Americanize or radically subvert but The Karate Kid goes about its business as if the 1984 original were somehow obliterated from the earth and the studio needed a reasonable facsimile for its vaults. Then again its been over 25 years since Rocky director John G. Avildsens endearing fish-out-of-water drama was a hit spawning three sequels and cable ubiquity and for the young people of today thats ancient history. Still the attempt to relocate the action from California (via New Jersey) to Beijing (via Detroit) makes for an awkward translation quite apart from the problems of trying to bottle the same magic with a lesser cast a lesser director and story elements that go bland with reheating. That the film works as well as it does--as an attractive rousing time-passer for children--speaks more to the endurance of a good formula than its revitalization. Though he showed some promise playing opposite his father in The Pursuit Of Happyness a few years ago Jaden Smith is too young too runty and not nearly charismatic enough to make anyone forget Ralph Macchio as a picked-on new kid with working-class roots. Taraji P. Henson fares better as his eternally optimistic single mother who takes a job (and a modest apartment) in China and drags her surly son with her. Smith finds a friend in a cute violin prodigy (Wenwen Han) but draws the attention of some high-kicking bullies who train under the same diabolical martial arts teacher. Into the Pat Morita role steps Jackie Chan doing uncharacteristically low-key work as a lonely handyman who teaches Smith self-defense. Director Harald Zwart takes advantage of the Chinese locations--no one could hope to out-montage Avildsen but a Great Wall training sequence is a start--but he and screenwriter Christopher Murphey are more translators than creators. They move some of the furniture around but any changes to the original film all make the new film worse from the reduced training-by-manual-labor tactics (here just Smith hanging a coat all day and night) to the goofy addition of a JumboTron at the tournament. Its still rousing despite itself with a soulful Chan performance that still pales in comparison to Moritas work. But the children of today should know the 1984 version exists and will make them happier. Perhaps their folks can dig up their VHS copy.

Comments (1) click to enlarge The Karate Kid Video Rated PG  139 minutes  2010 Will Smith produced this remake of the 1984 hit as a vehicle for his son Jaden. The willowy 12-year-old plays a Detroit boy who relocates to Beijing with his widowed mother (Taraji P. Henson); when hes bullied at school he seeks out kung fu lessons from their moody building superintendent (Jackie Chan) and learns that self-defense is only part of becoming a man. This is a smart departure for Chan whos been wasting his talent in mediocre comedies; the other actors dont fare as well. The plot takes forever to get rolling and the movie is hamstrung by numerous tourism sequences (from the Forbidden City to the Great Wall) facilitated by the state-run China Film Group.

"Karate Kid The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; karate-kid-the ) Karate Kid The (United States/China 2010) June 09 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli In many ways The Karate Kid is the perfect remake faithful to the source material in large part yet offering enough nuanced differences to allow it to stand on its own. The problem with the film is that that story hackneyed when it first made it to the screen in 1984 has grown only more tired over the past 26 years. The film adheres so rigorously to the typical sports-movie clichA(c)s with the downtrodden underdog facing off against the bullying favorite in a major tournament after finding a wise mentor and undergoing a long training process that instances of freshness can be found only in the margins. The Karate Kid would be no less familiar if it wasnt a remake. The biggest change between the 1984 edition and its 2010 successor is in tone. When Ralph Macchio wore the mantle of the title character the approach was generally lighthearted and occasionally cheesy. In the remake we have entered the Valley of Darkness. This is a grim motion picture. The bullies are more vicious than their predecessors the Karate Kid rarely smiles or jokes and the mentors dour demeanor veils a deep tragedy. Given todays societys predisposition toward the serious and cynical the change to The Karate Kids tone is warranted. It grounds the movie and prevents it from coming across as a self-parody. The trade-off - one some viewers will surely disagree with - is that the sense of innocence that permeated the 1984 version is gone. Despite the PG-rating and the reduction in age of the protagonist (from high school to junior high) The Karate Kid 2010 is a more adult production than its forebear. In 1984 the main character experienced the culture shock associated with changing coasts - moving from New Jersey to California. Here this aspect of the story has been amplified to create a true ""fish out of water"" scenario with Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) traveling alongside his mother Sherry (Taraji P. Henson) from the United States to China. In his new home Dre is unable to speak the language which limits his associations to those who know at least a little English. This includes the school bully Cheng who takes an instant dislike to Dre; a pretty girl Meiying who has the opposite reaction; and the apartment maintenance man Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) who spies a hidden promise in Dre. From there the story unfolds as expected the conflict between Cheng and Dre escalates with the latter repeatedly getting the short end of the stick; Dre learns that Mr. Han is a kung-fu master and pleads with the taciturn man to teach him; class and cultural differences threaten to derail Dres burgeoning relationship with Meiying; the training is more mundane than Dre expects; and everything builds toward the final showdown with Cheng. You dont have to see the movie to know how it ends. In fact you dont need to have seen any movie with the words ""Karate Kid"" in the title to predict with 100% accuracy how events will be resolved. One could argue that such certainty is a part of the movies charm. Or a key aspect of its weakness. The decision to ""de-age"" the main character by about four years works within the context of the story. Dre is not so young that a light romance with Meiying is out of place but his youth allows him to be vulnerable and to react with limited maturity. Where Macchios Daniel was angry about being forced to move from home Dre is hurt and lost. His cockiness disappears rapidly following his first beating at the hands of Cheng. It helps that Jaden Smith the son of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith is an adept performer with natural charisma. Jackie Chans Mr. Han bears only a passing resemblance to Pat Moritas Mr. Miyagi. Much of the humor associated with Miyagi has been left behind which is surprising since Chan is as much a comedian as an action star. A poignant incident in Miyagis past has been expanded into a full-blown tragedy for Han whose dour reticence is easily explained by this turn of events. Chan is a good actor and this role allows him to show a more dramatic persona than many of his fans will recognize; this is also an opportunity for him to use his martial arts skills in a manner befitting someone of his age. Its no longer believable to see Chan involved in intricately choreographed fights but teaching a kid is no stretch. One significant misstep made by the remake is how the act of physical repetition within Dres training is approached. In the original The Karate Kid Daniel was forced into doing a number of chores - waxing a car sanding a deck painting a fence and house - that appeared to benefit Miyagi but in reality were tasks designed to build and train his muscles. In the new movie his single action - picking up a sweatshirt and hanging it on a peg - follows the pattern of the 1984 movie but loses the essence. The pointlessness of the sweatshirt routine coupled with its limited association with the moves Dre learns botches an element that previously worked. There are some explicit nods to the 1984 movie. The title The Karate Kid is one. Although Daniel learned a variation of karate from Mr. Miyagi Dres martial art of choice is kung-fu. While Mr. Han never utters the iconic phrase ""wax on wax off"" he is shown in one scene to apply wax to a car using a circular motion. Theres also a sequence when he uses chopsticks in an attempt to capture a fly; however after growing impatient he employs a fly-swatter. Generally remakes fall somewhere on a spectrum of ""brilliant re-creation"" to ""embarrassing waste-of-time."" Although the uninspired resume of director Harald Zwart (whose previous efforts include Agent Cody Banks and The Pink Panther 2) might lead one to expect the worst The Karate Kid falls somewhere in the middle. It is redundant and unnecessary but its also inoffensive and does nothing to damage the reputation of the original. Despite the roughness of the violence (which probably should have resulted in a PG-13 rating) The Karate Kid offers something for nostalgic parents and children who dont want to see an ""old"" movie. Its perfectly adequate which might be the best one could hope for given the source material. Karate Kid The (United States/China 2010) Director Harald Zwart Cast Jaden Smith Jackie Chan Taraji P.

Henson; Director Harald Zwart; Release Date Wide 06/11/2010; Runtime (in minutes) 140; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Columbia Pictures Posted July 28 2012 -- 1200 AM EDT When a child star is cute and has a few instinctual acting moves thats probably enough to get him by. Jaden Smith who stars in the new remake of The Karate Kid scores on both counts but he also has something thats rare to see in a child actor. Hes got presence. As Dre Parker a pensive and fatherless 12-year-old from Detroit whose mother (Taraji P. Henson) gets transferred to the forbidding city of Beijing (the extreme move isnt really explained -- I mean couldnt she have been sent off to you know Denver?) Smith holds the screen while doing next to nothing just standing there silent and inquisitive trying to figure out an angle on the situation thats closing in on him. Smith of course is the son of Hollywood royalty (his parents are Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith) and you dont have to look hard to see traces especially of his father -- the cool glare of appraisal the quickness of his fury. With his nifty cornrows (a junior rappers do that marks how much hes grown up since The Pursuit of Happyness) Smith looks like an intensely aware goldfish. As Dre he gets knocked down by bullies and drawn to the sweet sparkle of a teen violinist but whomever he shares the screen with he combines a kids directness with an adults way of holding himself in check. Though its not too varied a performance Smith like his father acts with an emotional ease thats almost gymnastic. A remake of the 1984 go-for-it classic the new Karate Kid is longer than the original film (its 140 minutes) and a couple of shades more downbeat with Dre as a lonely Odd Kid Out in the bustling bureaucratic China that is his new home. Jackie Chan has a corresponding melancholy as the maintenance man who teaches Dre the art of kung fu. (Yes they should have called it The Kung Fu Kid -- but you dont mess with brand titles like this one.) All in all The Karate Kid is a more somber less playful movie than the original but at heart its the same old irresistible candy corn. I did for a while miss the sly poker-faced humor that Pat Morita brought to the role of Mr. Miyagi. When Chans Mr. Han begins Dres training by ordering him to hang his jacket on a hook then throw it on the floor pick it up and do it all again and again its a variation on the wax-on wax-off gimmickry of the first film. Morita though let us know that he was enjoying the slightly sadistic joke of the Zen discipline he was enforcing. Chan in a scruffy goatee plays Han as very serious almost morose in his mission. He makes the guru-mentor slightly damaged goods; Han needs this kid as much as the kid needs him. Their earnestness grows on you though. The bond these two share is sincere and touching. The movie builds of course to the big kung fu tournament in which Dre finally faces down a bully who has been trained to fight with ""no mercy."" Its a piece of inspirational hokum that works nicely though I do wish the film had been a bit more ingenious about shoehorning in the famous Ralph Macchio ""crane"" stance. That said The Karate Kid is fun and believable on the most important level It convinces us that Jaden Smith has what it takes to fight his way to the top.

The Karate Kid Fair Director Harald Zwart. Cast Jaden Smith Jackie Chan Taraji P. Henson. Rating PG for bullying martial-arts violence and mild language. RELATED Hollywood reboots Spotlight Jackie Chan Martial arts movies Just an unnecessary one. Jaden Smith (Wills son) is adorable if perhaps too fragile as the bullied fatherless boy who finds an unlikely mentor (Jackie Chan) who teaches him by way of martial arts how to believe in himself and while hes at it kick some butt. Director Harald Zwart is adept at laying on the inspiration though the bad guys are so thoroughly mustache-twisting evil you almost want to root for them just for entertainments sake. Does the movie have anything new to say anything different from John G. Avildsens 1984 original with Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita? Not particularly. So why remake it? Avildsens film was a small wonder that became an unlikely hit and something of an offbeat cultural touchstone with Macchio as the boy and Morita as the handyman who is handy with martial arts as well. Avildsen who also directed ""Rocky"" brought a lot of that root-for-the-underdog spirit to what is a fairly standard story making it better than it might have been - sort of ""Rocky"" with a crane pose. In Zwarts film a much bigger affair the story takes place in China which allows for some stunning shots of the Great Wall the Forbidden City and other landmarks. It also provides for more of a cross-cultural experience with the cute Dre trying to learn Chinese eat with chopsticks etc. But the heart of the story is the same down to the striking of an unorthodox kung fu stance at a climactic moment. Dre (Smith) moves to China with his mother Sherry (Taraji P. Henson) after shes transferred from her job in Detroit. Dre naturally isnt happy. He is attracted to Meiying (Wenwen Han) a girl he meets in a park but its not long before hes thrashed by the sadistic school bully Cheng (Zhenwei Wang). It turns out he and his friends are students of a particularly ruthless form of kung fu taught by a ruthless instructor. The impulsive Dre cant keep from messing with the bullies however. Theyre administering another beating when suddenly theyre thwarted by Mr. Han (Chan) the handyman in Dres building who to this point has mostly shuffled around the grounds. It turns out that he is a kung fu master and is willing to teach Dre so that he can compete in an upcoming tournament. Echoing the original Mr. Han uses unorthodox (though different) methods to train Dre. And Mr. Han has a secret. Whats different aside from the setting is that Smith is so small a wisp of a fellow. Macchio wasnt exactly a bodybuilder but he was a little older a little more substantial. Zwart makes sure to get across the pain and suffering Dres beatings leave him with but a couple of punches look like theyd be hard to come back from Mr. Hans healing methods notwithstanding. Smith is charismatic Han quite good and adorable. Chan only fights in one scene unusual for him. But its Cheng who is the most intriguing character because Wang is such a compelling actor. Despite zero backstory he gets across the menacing vibe of a true bully; at times he looks so enraged over small things that its scary. Thats another difference from the first ""Karate Kid.""

Never mind the bullies A language barrier and East-vs.-West ethnic tensions are the chief opponents facing this new ""Karate Kid."" While it boasts some high-concept novelty in its colorful Chinese backdrop and the sage casting of Jackie Chan in the Pat Morita role Sonys multiculti reboot remains largely faithful to the enduring 1984 crowdpleaser albeit with enough tin-eared English and Mandarin dialogue to bring another famous Chan (Charlie) to mind. Results are often flatly formulaic but ingratiating enough to lure family audiences onto the mat though the hefty runtime might undercut pics B.O. chops. ""Kid"" might also find an audience among devotees of the John G. Avildsen-directed original (and to a lesser extent its three increasingly disposable sequels). While its easy to laugh now at that films 80s accoutrements and ""Rocky""-for-runts uplift its blend of earnest naivete and underdog-saga manipulation still goes down pretty smoothly thanks to the warm yin-yang rapport of leads Ralph Macchio and Morita. As helmed by Harald Zwart (""Agent Cody Banks"" ""One Night at McCools"") from a script by Christopher Murphey this remake is an even more calculated item -- shrewdly updated for our era of globalization dislocation and parkour but engineered to deliver the same dramatic satisfactions as the original almost beat for beat. A reassuring familiarity seeps in as early as the opening frames when we meet 12-year-old Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) whos far less excited than his mother Shelly (a wonderful Taraji P. Henson) about their move from Detroit to Beijing. Dre has barely mastered chopsticks when he becomes smitten with cute violinist Meiying (Han Wenwen) only to immediately run afoul of some aggressive young thugs led by Cheng (Wang Zhenwei) who subjects the shrimpy foreigner to a merciless demonstration of his kung fu prowess. Indeed ""The Kung Fu Kid"" would have made a more accurate if less marketable title as Mr. Han (Chan) a local maintenance man and dormant kung fu master reluctantly takes Dre under his wing in hopes of getting him in shape for an upcoming martial-arts tournament. So as to teach his disciple the importance of focus obedience inner strength and oneness with nature Mr. Han takes Dre on several excursions to the scenic Wudang Mountains and inevitably the Great Wall one of many easy-access cultural cliches on display here. (Among the lessons in store for impressionable youngsters in the audience Chinese people are skillful classical musicians value family honor above all else and really enjoy touching black peoples hair.) While theres a potentially compelling movie to be made about an African-American adolescent struggling to adjust to life in urban China ""Kids"" engagement with its setting never goes far beyond the picturesque (and as lensed by Roger Pratt in such locations as the Forbidden City it is picturesque indeed). Scenic training montages aside theres never the sense that Dre is learning anything meaningful from his new surroundings (like the language for starters) that will benefit him in the real world once hes beaten the bad guys. Apart from routine attacks by pint-sized flying ninjas Dre has it pretty easy Never a scrap of homework and just about all the locals revert to English in his presence. (Even tough guy Cheng seems weirdly accommodating when he snarls things like ""You are fast but not fast enough"") All of which is to say that ""The Karate Kid Foreign-Exchange Edition"" is essentially a glossy Far East fairy tale and as such its appeal rests on the flexed shoulders of its lead actors both of whom have the unenviable task of stepping into iconic roles and acquit themselves reasonably well. Smith is saddled with a bit too much defensive/bratty attitude early on but the plucky young actor comes into his own when the roles estimable physical demands set in (Smith learned kung fu from Chans regular stunt coordinator Wu Gang). Ideally cast as a martial-arts maven whos seen better days Chan initially channels Morita in his use of terse vaguely Buddhist aphorisms before his instinctive warmth and good humor as a performer take over. Thesp even manages to sock over the moment when Mr. Han boozily discloses a traumatic memory -- a scene that didnt work especially well in the original and still feels tacked-on here. Overall the filmmakers have largely opted to embellish rather than excise suggesting their reluctance to depart much from the original template. Still its a sign of that pics dramatic durability that ""Kid"" manages to be as absorbing as it is despite its nearly 21/2-hour running time and that the climactic tournament (now with instant replay) sustains interest even when its clear when and where the blows will land. Henson offers rock-solid support while Han could hardly be more winning as Dres love interest. In lieu of the originals Joe Esposito the soundtrack includes tunes by John Mayer AC/DC and the ubiquitous Justin Bieber classily offset by some welcome snatches of Chopin and Rachmaninoff.
