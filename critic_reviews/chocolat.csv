Lent in the Gascony village of Lansquenet. A red-hooded woman (Binoche) and child (Thivosol) boldly set about converting the old bakery into a chocolate shop which offers delights so tempting that hyper-conservative mayor Reynaud (Molina) fearing for the moral and religious health of the villagers determines to eject her from the community. Well what with Viannes witchlike knowledge of their hearts desires the effrontery of her fashionable dress her friendship with the despised river rats led by handsome Irish-accented Roux (Depp) she does stir some dangerous emotions in this backwater. Even so the villagers rally to her life-affirming cause. From the start Hallstroms soft adaptation of Joanne Harriss popular novel-cum-magical fable smoothly proceeds to construct a feminist parable about the role of courage support and pleasure in personal transformation. But however excellent the performances their relevance is diminished by the historical bubble in which theyre situated. Roger Pratts period cinematography preserves the whole in aspic.

(Miramax) ""Chocolat"" an appealing comic fable aimed at those with a bittersweet tooth is a gourmet treat in the tradition of the more nutritious ""Babettes Feast."" Foodies should not resist it nor should those susceptible to the gentle - some might say poky - rhythms of Lasse Hallstrom who does for cocoa here what he did for sour apples in ""Cider House Rules."" Based on a novel by Joanne Harris the film takes place in the late 1950s in Lansquenet an isolated French hamlet governed by the pious Comte de Reynaud (wonderfully stuffy Alfred Molina). A devout Catholic the mayor prides himself on his piety which he forces upon the resigned citizens of the hidebound community. Lest new ideas take root the mayor writes the sermons for the malleable young priest (Hugh OConor) a timid Elvis fan who dares not speak against the mayors rigidity. Then one day single mother Vianne (radiant Juliette Binoche) and her daughter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol) arrive in Lansquenet with the gusting north wind. Its clear from their cloaks modeled after the one sported by Red Riding Hood that this is no ordinary pair. Their vivid magical garb stands out against the drab gray village just as their passion contrasts with the pinched faces of the citizenry. When Vianne rents out a patisserie during Lent the mayor the most abstemious of men pays a call. How dare she tempt the fasting parishioners with the smell of fresh baked goods? Not a problem responds Vianne who is turning the shop into something even more diabolical a chocolaterie its delectable bonbons inspired by her Mayan mothers recipes. Vianne a character born of magical realism soon lures the more susceptible into her shop where along with her gourmet chocolates she puts a little zing into the lives of her repressed clientele. Soon to the mayors dismay estranged family members are reconciling bored spouses are having great sex and senior citizens are regaining their lust for life. In truth all this goodness does get a little sticky. Not one to settle down the films heroine decides its time to move on much to her daughters dismay. The little girl longs for a home and her mothers wanderlust breaks her heart. Vianne comes to understand her childs sense of loss when she falls in love with a sexy drifter (Johnny Depp) who cant resist the call of the road. Depp brings a much-needed spark to the proceedings which become repetitious after a time. After all you can eat only so much chocolate. The tale takes on a darker tone during this episode which exposes the dangers of intolerance. But this is a fairy tale after all and the ending is not about to mess with the concept of Happily Ever After. Leslie Caron Lena Olin John Wood and Judi Dench round out the likable supporting cast of characters all of them transformed by the themes of the movie that it is okay to be different and important to accept those who are - and that eating truffles doesnt make you a pig. ""Chocolat"" (115 minutes) is rated PG-13.

Starring Juliette Binoche Johnny Depp Judi Dench Lena Olin. Directed by Lasse Hallstrom. (Rated PG-13. 116 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In ""Chocolat"" Juliette Binoche is a chocolate maker with a secret ingredient - - she adds chiles to her candies for an invigorating mix. The movie however suffers from disparate elements. A lighthearted fable with jarring scenes of violence and halfhearted stabs at mystical realism its saving grace is its gooey center the luminous Binoche. Director Lasse Hallstrom (""The Cider House Rules"") gives ""Chocolat"" a sugary self-awareness from its opening minutes with a shot of an idyllic French village of cocoa-colored buildings flocked by marshmallow-snow hills. Binoche wanders into town and sets up shop immediately addicting the townspeople to her confections. Her candies and her illegitimate daughter scandalize the towns overly pious mayor and consorting with a river gypsy played by Johnny Depp doesnt help her cause. A SOUR SUBPLOT Because its a fable we know that Binoche and the towns inhabitants will have a profound effect on one another. We also know that Depp and Binoches characters both charming and itinerant will hook up and start to yearn for something more permanent. What we dont expect is a domestic violence subplot in which a woman -- Hallstroms real-life spouse Lena Olin -- is terrorized by her husband after finding refuge with Binoche. The scene is genuinely scary and both its pat resolution and the humorous treatment of the husbands attempts at penitence are disconcerting in a film otherwise framed so sweetly. ""Chocolat"" also stumbles in its bids at ""Like Water for Chocolate"" mysticism. Binoche is supposed to have magical powers but the only evidence we get is her ability to predict what customers will like. Any good saleswoman could do the same thing no hocus-pocus required. GOOD PERFORMANCES ""Chocolat"" does have some fine performances. Binoche is warm and inviting as the endless vats of chocolate onscreen. Her soft-focus close-ups are overkill Binoche radiates a chocolately goodness all on her own. She is especially good in scenes with Olin and with Judi Dench who plays her cranky but fun-loving landlord. Both seem to visibly blossom in the presence of Binoche and the safe haven of the chocolate shop. Carrie-Anne Moss as Denchs disapproving and dowdy church secretary daughter is almost unrecognizable from ""The Matrix."" She does a nice job conveying the daughters inevitable thawing toward the old bird. Binoches scenes with Depp have a nice flirty naturalness. Depp named Roux but speaking with an improbable Irish brogue is mostly required to stand there looking beautiful in peasant shirts and long artfully braided hair. He does a good job of it.

(Miramax) I suppose a filmmaker cant go wrong with a movie about chocolate can he? Its like making a film about oxygen love or democracy. I mean isnt everyone ""for"" chocolate? And wouldnt that make me the confectionary equivalent of a Grinch to say that Lasse Hallstroms ""Chocolat"" didnt particularly engage my sweet tooth? Set in France during the 1950s the movie is about a single mother named Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) who breezes into the morally uptight town of Lansquenet to lease the local patisserie. But it doesnt sit well with the humorless Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina) that shes opening a sinfully delicious chocolate shop smack dab in the middle of Lent. Her success is dramatic thanks to an uncanny ability to find the perfect recipe for every customer. She slips a little chili powder into the chocolate drink of the dour Armande Voizin (Judi Dench) and makes a friend for life. Another Vianne concoction charges up one couples sex life. And her confections even inspire a friendship with the sullen Josephine (Lena Olin) and induce the aged shy Guillaume (John Wood) to finally court the woman (Leslie Caron) of his dreams. Quite clearly Madame Rocher is destroying (read empowering) the emotional climate of this town. The lines to the confession booth are long these days. So Reynaud a self-appointed guardian of morality makes it his personal mission to run her out of business. And it doesnt help matters that Vianne offers him something called ""Nipples of Venus"" when he visits the store. When Vianne befriends - and warms romantically to - a barge-dwelling gypsy and local pariah (the handsome apparently bored Johnny Depp) the scheming politician practically declares war. Binoche is almost industrially lovable. Molina and Dench are dutifully watchable. And Peter Stormare is occasionally inspired as a brutish husband who becomes a pawn in the comtes scheme. Its enjoyable to watch this dark almost psychotic man undergo a fast reeducation in Scripture class struggling to remember the three conditions for mortal sin under the pious gaze of a priest (Hugh OConor). But these performances are simply not enough to deliver the movie to the level of ""Like Water for Chocolate"" ""Babettes Feast"" and other great movies about the magical connection between the gastronomic and the romantic or spiritual. Director Hallstrom who also made ""The Cider House Rules"" directs this movie as if its being made for public television rather than the big screen. I can only bestow this adaptation of Joanne Harriss bestselling novel with such faint praise as ""pleasant"" and ""mildly disarming."" If this movie were part of an assortment in a chocolate box I wouldnt spit it into my napkin. But I wouldnt reach for it a second time either. ""Chocolat"" (PG-13 121 minutes) - Contains urination some strong language mild sexual scenes and a little domestic assault and battery.

""Chocolat"" is more than a delicious confection; its a richly textured comic fable that blends Old World wisdom with a winking timely commentary on the assumed moral superiority of the political right. The most satisfying epicurean feast since ""Big Night"" ""Chocolat"" is generously laced with Lasse Hallstroms trademark observations on the limitless capacity of the human spirit. Pic reps the directors successful reteaming after ""The Cider House Rules"" with Miramax which is sure to maximize the benefits of this crowd-pleasing holiday treat despite the lack of blockbuster elements. With a rollout platform release building on favorable reviews and strong word of mouth ""Chocolat"" has the recipe for mid-range success. Set in France in the late 1950s story opens in the fictional hamlet of Lansquenet a medieval village unchanged for centuries. Hallstrom makes that point with deft economy in pics opening moments A sweeping aerial shot of the isolated town yields to images of dowdy villagers on their way to Mass. As resistant to change as their village once was to medieval warriors these are folk whose abiding principle is tranquilite -- a tranquillity that depends on maintaining Christian traditions of abstinence penitence and moral righteousness. And when the blustery north wind blows into town bringing with it the red-hooded unwed mother Vianne Rocher (the quietly radiant Juliette Binoche) and her young daughter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol) nothing could be a greater threat to the status quo. Vianne leases the patisserie during Lent a plan that the towns mayor and guardian of morality the Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina) insists is nothing short of sacrilege. Not to worry the rosy-cheeked Vianne informs him cheerily its not going to be a pastry shop. It will in fact be something much worse a chocolate shop the likes of which Lansquenet has never seen. Splashed with color and Mayan ceramics the shop has the decor sniffs elderly dowager Armande Voizin (Judi Dench) of an ""early Mexican brothel."" And while shes hardly a madam Vianne soon exerts a mysterious influence over the townspeople. Though wary of the outsiders presence they are lured one by one by her shops delectable scents and visual pleasures and are delightedly surprised by Viannes instinct for guessing her customers favorite chocolates. Her blend of culinary magic and intuition soon restores the zing in one couples sex life and helps an elderly gentleman (John Wood) find the courage to court a widow (Leslie Caron) he has admired from afar. Viannes confections even enable the once-grumpy Armande to mend a rift with the grandson (Aurelien Parent Koenig) her estranged daughter (Carrie-Anne Moss) has forbidden her to see. Along with Armande Vianne finds a friend in the initially skittish Josephine (Lena Olin) the long-suffering wife of the towns boorish cafe proprietor (Peter Stormare). But even as some of the townsfolk begin to trust Vianne others think she is doing the devils work prompting the indignant Comte de Reynaud to declare a moral war on Vianne and her chocolate shop. This tension accounts for a number of comic moments involving parishioners guilty confessions about their lust for chocolate to the young priest (Hugh OConor) who is himself -- gasp -- an Elvis Presley fan. Fed up with the Comtes self-righteousness Vianne decides to inflame existing tensions by taking up with the roguish Roux (Johnny Depp) an Irish gypsy who arrives in town with a ragtag guitar-strumming crew. Roux and his band of reprobates are to the Comte a moral abomination about whom ""something must be done."" Final act involves a narrowly averted disaster that nearly runs Vianne out of town. Being a Hallstrom film however ""Chocolat"" tempers the bitter with the sweet. The film finally is about having the power to change to accept others regardless of their differences. Brimming with dualities it pairs themes of feast with fasting and Christian tradition against pagan rituals. Though Vianne is clearly the heroine the Comte who believes he is doing good is not altogether villainous. Hallstrom couldnt have asked for a better cast to embody those themes; likewise his production team has done an exquisite job of giving life to Robert Nelson Jacobs taut script. David Gropmans well-conceived production design illustrates the evolution of Lansquenet from a moribund monochrome village to a newly upbeat town infused with color and light beautifully captured in Roger Pratts lens. Costumes by Renee Ehrlich Kalfus provide the sartorial complement to those themes beginning with Viannes red cape and pink pumps and spreading to the bright hues incorporated in the wardrobes of Josephine Armande and others. Rachel Portmans score offers suitably buoyant notes that underscore character and help develop themes. ChocolatProductionA Miramax Films release of a David Brown production.

Juliette Binoche stars as a luscious stranger who blows into a chilly pinched pious 1950s French village and sets up shop making chocolate confections that arouse the gentry to a ""shocking"" preference for pleasure over abstinence. The machine-polished cast includes Judi Dench Alfred Molina and Lena Olin.
