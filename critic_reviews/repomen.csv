Comments Repo Men Video 2010 Midnight-movie fans may already know Darren Lynn Bousmans Repo The Genetic Opera (2008) an insane futuristic rock opera in which corporate goons barge into peoples homes and bloodily reclaim transplanted organs that havent been paid for on time. This Universal Pictures release has exactly the same premise but was reportedly hatched in 2003 by screenwriters Garrett Lerner and Eric Garcia (whos published the story in novel form as The Repossession Mambo). Jude Law and Forest Whitaker are the callous thugs of the title and Liev Schreiber is their white-collar boss; after a plot twist sticks Law with a transplanted heart he cant pay off he goes on the run with fellow deadbeat Alice Braga. This was too long mean and gory for me though the satirical gloss and well-executed trick ending will probably impress some. Miguel Sapochnik directed. R 111 min. By J.R.

BOTTOM LINE Surprisingly engrossing with an emphasis on the gross. CAST Jude Law Forest Whitaker Alice Braga Liev Schreiber LENGTH 151 Up in the ranks of big-time filmmaking the war in Iraq is the big issue See the Oscar-winning ""The Hurt Locker"" and last weeks Matt Damon vehicle ""Green Zone."" Down in the trenches of populist filmmaking - horror action pulp - there is evident anger over another hot topic health care. ""Repo Men"" like last years ""Saw VI"" has great fun demonizing the health-care industry and contrasting its cold pragmatism with warm gore. The time is the near future and a company called The Union is selling artificial organs to folks who cant afford them (a nod for good measure to the subprime mortgage meltdown). Deadbeats beware Union contractor Remy (Jude Law) will take that organ back on the spot and without anesthesia. The premise isnt new; an oddball horror-musical called ""Repo The Genetic Opera"" came out two years ago. Still ""Repo Men"" is better and smarter than you might expect. advertisement | advertise on newsday Thats partly because of the top-notch cast. Against all odds Law makes Remy an empathetic anti-hero while Forest Whitaker nearly steals the movie as his faithful repo partner. Liev Schreiber sneers it up beautifully as a heartless Union bigwig; Alice Braga breathes a little life into a token role. First-time director Miguel Sapochnik directs with borrowed panache - youll catch glimmers of ""Blade Runner"" ""Total Recall"" David Cronenbergs ""Crash"" and even Terry Gilliams ""Brazil"" in this slightly overlong film. All in all its a darkly bloody good time and a vicarious way to take a hacksaw to your HMO.

Kerry Hayes Repo Men Director Miguel Sapochnik Genre Sci-Fi ThrillerRunning Time 111 minutes Rated R for strong bloody violence grisly images language and some sexuality/nudity.With Jude Law Forest Whitaker Liev Schreiber Alice Braga and Carice van Houten Watch Clips You Owe It To Your Family Ask Me About My Lips Predatory lending is taken to macabre new lows in Miguel Sapochniks debut feature Repo Men In a dystopian future that recalls a spruced-up version of Blade Runner an organization called The Union offers a chance at better living through technology. Though technically a health-care organization The Union operates more like a used-car dealer It drives a hard bargain on artificial organs and if you cant make your payments -- at over 19 percent interest on prices in the mid-six figures -- the movies titular enforcers will track you down zap you unconscious and cut their property back out. This may sound familiar Repo Men is actually the second film about organ repossession released in less than two years after the 2008 goth-industrial musical Repo A Genetic Opera. Theres valuable social commentary to be mined here but two movies into this budding subgenre its clear that filmmakers havent yet moved past the shock value of violently yanking bloody organs out of living human beings. Repo Men may not be as awful as its predecessor but thats the faintest of praise. Remy and Jake (Jude Law and Forest Whitaker) are two of The Unions best collectors. Remy however is having a crisis of conscience over his chosen field. Not because of any moral qualms about slicing open semi-conscious people to harvest a mechanical kidney mind you; his wife just doesnt like it when he gets home late. Theres a lot of pesky night work inherent in the job. When a freak accident makes Remy the recipient of a shiny new piece of internal hardware hes forced to reevaluate his chosen field. Unfortunately just when he most needs the cash he finds that his mechanical heart seems to have granted him more empathy toward his victims than his biological one ever did. Hes soon past due and as he becomes a target hes reduced to hiding out in the same refugee shantytowns he once delighted in raiding for a big payday. This reversal of fortune plays out without many surprises. i The Hard Sell Liev Schreiber plays Frank the smooth-talking manager of a company that markets replacement organs to the sick and the injured. hide caption toggle caption The Hard Sell Liev Schreiber plays Frank the smooth-talking manager of a company that markets replacement organs to the sick and the injured. There is a talented pool of actors wasted here; most of them sleepwalk through a script by Eric Garcia and Garrett Lerner that reduces them to one-note caricatures. In fact the films best performance is little more than a cameo -- a surprisingly touching turn from hip-hop impresario RZA as a debt-ridden music producer who is delinquent on his artificial heart payments. But while his one scene opens the door for a larger role the character disappears as quickly as he arrives. Almost any film can benefit from a little more RZA but Repo Men fails to take full advantage of his presence. Sapochnik a veteran of motion-picture art departments seems more interested in finding new and exciting ways for blood to seep splatter and spurt than in telling a compelling story. He attempts to distract from the shortcomings by filling his movie with an endless string of tributes to better films the iconic hallway fight scene in the ultraviolent Korean classic Oldboy and the shot of adrenaline to the heart from Pulp Fiction among them. But the overused homages and a tacked-on twist ending are just failed attempts to save Repo Men from its own shallow blood lust.

Jude Law? Forget it - this nasty non-thriller shares nothing but a similar title with Alex Coxs nutty 1984 head trip through LA and mores the pity. Here were in that gone-to-pot near-future so beloved of filmmakers where Law and Whitaker (pictured) are pals and colleagues working in a debt-recovery department with a difference they recover human organs. The film pitches friend against friend as Law ends up with a new ticker and darts about town with fellow post-op target Alice Braga in tow. Ideas excitement and logic are ditched in favour of blood and gore - and theres no fun to be had watching operations and knife fights. Law and Whitaker are disastrous in the lead roles. Its a dreary and violent film that betrays its three years spent on the shelf.

Unfortunately its downhill after that after Jude Laws ruthless repo man persona supposedly develops a conscience and embarks on a mission for the good of mankind which one has to say is not particularly successful as it ends in the gory death of large number of ` mankind` . . . No doubt the producers decided to go for a target audience of 12 year old boys with an18 certificate .( DVD sales should do well) A dis appointing film in which its difficult to summon up any sympathy for the unbelievable characters.

Add to ... Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 19 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Mar. 18 2010 750PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Repo Men Directed by Miguel Sapochnik Written by Eric Garcia and Garrett Lerner Starring Jude Law Forest Whitaker and Liev Shreiber Classification 18A The obvious question about Repo Men Why bother? In this science-fiction film Remy and Jake (Jude Law and Forest Whittaker) are partners who hunt down people who havent kept up payments on their artificial organs and using a stun gun and scalpel the partners reclaim them. Surely an artificial organ could have a remotely controlled off-switch which would avoid the bloody splatter and the reason for this movie. Instead some movie executive couldnt resist the opportunity to bring together fans of Saw and Hostel torture porn with the crowd that say enjoyed Laws Hamlet on Broadway. True Hamlets violent as well but this feels like a stretch. Because it doesnt actually make any sense the movie relies on jaunty voiceover transitions by Remy (Law) as he introduces us to his childhood friend Jake (Whitaker) and boss Frank (Liev Shreiber) employees of a corporation called The Union. Not everybodys onside with the new worlds collection methods. Remys wife (Carice van Houten) who would prefer it if he went into sales eventually leaves him in disgust. But Remy doesnt have a change of heart until well until he gets a change of heart. After an electrical accident he has a new artificial ticker installed and suddenly loses his taste for carving up other peoples torsos. Alternately smirking and dully disgusting the movie goes through a conventional journey to the broken-down outskirts of town where Remy meets the various black-market organ types. He hooks up with torch singer and multiple transplant host Beth played by Alice Braga (familiar from such previous dystopias as I Am Legend and Blindness). Together they plot to free the populace from organ debt leading to a vast amount of stabbing and hammering and then a tender episode where in an embrace they stick their hands into each others incisions to retrieve overdue parts. David Cronenberg may be owed royalties. In fact the script for Repo Men is adapted from Eric Garcias novel The Repossession Mambo. The plot has much in common with the rock opera and film Repo The Genetic Opera by Darren Lynn Bousman who has directed three of the Saw movies. Its not entirely clear who had the idea first but was it really worth borrowing?

Focus Features By Joe Morgenstern Updated March 19 2010 1201 a.m. ET One of the most touching lines in Noah Baumbachs remarkable ""Greenberg"" is an announcement by the wistful young heroine Florence Marr ""Ive gotta stop doing things just because they feel good."" Good? Theres no evidence that Florence--a portrait of heartbreaking delicacy by Greta Gerwig--feels truly good about anything. She feels bad about herself and properly anxious about an emerging love affair with Roger Greenberg a middle-aging misanthrope played with intransigent brilliance by Ben Stiller. Everythings relative of course. Florence is joyous compared to Roger a former musician whose anger at the world is matched only by his narcissism. Yet the wonder of the film is how good it makes us feel. ""Greenberg"" scintillates with intelligence razors-edge humor and austere empathy for its struggling lovers. Watch a clip from the movie ""Greenberg"" starring Ben Stiller Juno Temple Jennifer Jason Leigh and Rhys Ifans; directed by Noah Baumbach of ""The Squid and the Whale."" Video courtesy of Focus Features. This is a new departure for Mr. Baumbach even though he might seem to be working the same territory of neurotic dysfunction and mutual need that he explored sometimes relentlessly in ""The Squid and the Whale"" and ""Margot at the Wedding."" Whats new is the combination of warmth and reserve. The film is extremely entertaining--a real romance however tortured it may be--yet tough-minded and confidently self-contained. The setting is Los Angeles whose physical and spiritual sprawl has been rendered with eerie accuracy. Fittingly the first extended sequence takes place in a car with Florence behind the wheel and the camera fixed on her pretty face. (Harris Savides did the fine cinematography.) ""You gonna let me in?"" she asks nervously. Shes alone running errands so the question is clearly directed at another driver in another lane. But its also the anthem of her needy psyche and her lonely life. She works as a personal assistant to Phillip Greenberg (Chris Messina) who lives with his wife and kids in the Hollywood Hills. When the family goes off on vacation to Vietnam Florence stays behind to take care of their German shepherd Mahler and to provide whatever support may be needed for Phillips brother Roger newly arrived from New York via a mental institution that was treating him for depression. Of the menage a trois that forms in the familys absence Mahler proves to be the most stable member and even he comes down with an autoimmune disease that lands him at the vets. ""Greenberg"" is a love story yes but its also a tale of two people adrift in separate currents constantly sinking and bobbing to the surface like synchro swimmers out of sync. Florences judgment is dreadful when it comes to men in general and potentially disastrous when it comes to this one. She cant understand why Roger lets her into his life then brutally ejects her not just once but repeatedly. ""You like me a lot more than you think you do"" she tells him after one rebuff. Although shes right Florence is a slow learner who takes a long time to recall a cautionary phrase--""hurt people hurt people""--that she picked up along her painful way. Ms. Gerwigs performance is extraordinary--notably nuanced commandingly tender. But the movies title is ""Greenberg"" not ""Marr"" and Mr. Stiller commands a kind of awe in his refusal to clothe the naked hostility of a character who suffers from the autoimmune disease of self-loathing. (""Life is wasted on people"" the hero says at one point.) An ardent arsonist he has burned most of the bridges that once connected him to friends and a flourishing career. Much of the time Roger looks either haunted or absent not a black hole but a gray one. ENLARGE Greta Gerwig plays Greenbergs love interest. Focus Features Rhys Ifans plays Ivan a former band mate whom Roger seeks out after arriving in L.A. Ivan comes on quietly a sweet-spirited seeker who has found his way after losing it but he finally gets his own turn at eloquent anger and Mr. Ifans rises powerfully to the occasion. Mr. Baumbachs wife Jennifer Jason Leigh (she collaborated with him on the story and served as producer) is attractive and understated as Beth Rogers old flame. A movie with an off-putting hero represents a huge risk. Messrs. Baumbach and Stiller made a bet that we would stay with Roger and the film until things took a turn for the better. The bet pays off beautifully--not because the hero is revealed to be nice but because he reveals himself to be human in a series of startling rages and astonishing monologues that lead to a pleasing climax (and an inspired shot of a giant red balloon-man arms and legs flapping wildly.) Roger delivers one monologue to Florences phone mail and another to a bunch of heedless twenty-something kids at a party. Its a poignant expression of mortality by a man whos finally growing into his life. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo ENLARGE Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Music Box Films A stylish thriller with real complexity people with interesting faces a sensational actress cast as an ambisexual Goth hacker heroine--the news about ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" is nothing but good. Niels Arden Oplev directed this first of three feature films in Swedish with English subtitles to be adapted from the widely admired Millennium Trilogy by the late Stieg Larsson. The crime at the center of the mystery is the coldest of cases in a very cold climate. Forty years ago a young woman named Harriet Vanger vanished during the course of a family gathering on a private island. Now her uncle obsessed with her loss has hired a disgraced journalist as his private detective and instructed him to concentrate on the Vanger family with its history of Fascist leanings and general nastiness. Michael Nyqvist plays the journalist Mikael Blomkvist. Hes very good a sophisticated actor whos thoroughly comfortable in the role of an urban sophisticate. But all eyes including his are on Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander the tattooed--and in at least two ways tortured--young woman who hacks into Mikaels life and becomes his uninvited co-investigator. Lisbeth is a mystery within the mystery. ""How did you turn out this way?"" the journalist asks her as well he might. The clues to that question are shockingly persuasive but inevitably incomplete. The mystery of what happened to Harriet Vanger is much more abstract since she vanished so long ago but the techniques involved in solving it are intriguing a computer-age update of such classic films as ""Blowup"" (teasing out information from photographs) ""The Conversation"" and ""Blow Out"" (doing the same with sound recordings). And Mikael and Lisbeth are a matchlessly mismatched couple who complement each other all the same in what amounts to intimate file-sharing. The Art of the Steal ENLARGE Albert C. barnes with his dog Fidele in The Art of the Steal. IFC Films After Don Argotts ""The Art of the Steal"" played the Toronto International Film Festival and the New York Film Festival last fall the Journal assigned a Philadelphia cultural reporter Julia Klein to write an article about the documentary which deals with the bitter cultural battle that ensued when the Barnes Foundation decided to move its peerless collection of post-Impressionist paintings from its gallery in suburban Merion Pa. to downtown Philadelphia. Now that the film is in commercial release Ill say only that Ms. Klein judged it to be a skillful though far from impartial summary of a complex subject while I found it fascinating for a number of reasons balanced reporting not among them. The complexity flows from the nature of the conflict which pitted partisans of the Barnes credo--maintaining the collection as a private adjunct to the foundations educational function--against civic political and philanthropic advocates of making the paintings available to the largest number of people. (The film comes down firmly on the side of Barnes loyalists.) And though the final decision to move the collection has been made the bitterness still flows from the question of whether that decision violated provisions of the trust that established the foundation. (The film makes a vigorous case for the notion that it did.) What ""The Art of the Steal"" documents most dramatically is the irresistible pull of irreplaceable art. Repo Men All too often in studio films--especially rotten ones like Universals ""Repo Men""--you can hear the studio notes. Theyre the needless explanations inserted into scripts at the insistence of production executives who fear that filmgoers wont be able to understand whats going on without help. ""The thing is"" Jude Laws character muses helpfully in this film ""I have an artificial heart and she has an artificial everything else. Its just two parts of the same puzzle. Maybe its not just her Im trying to save."" The real puzzle is how a major studio could put its name on such a heartless piece of hack work. Watch a clip from the movie ""Repo Men"" a science-fiction thriller starring Jude Law. Video courtesy of Universal. ""Repo Men"" shouldnt be confused with Alex Coxs 1984 classic ""Repo Man"" to which it bears no resemblance or ""Repo The Genetic Opera"" a bizarre 2008 flop from which it repossessed a premise and plenty more. In a sci-fi future when organ replacements are routine and financed like cars Mr. Laws Remy a repo man for a transplant company called The Union retrieves organs--violently and graphically--from customers who have fallen behind in their payments. Until that is he must go into hock for a new ticker of his own. The film starts out as a cheerfully lurid buddy picture with Forest Whitaker as Jake Remys dim-bulb partner in disorganization. Enrique Chediaks cinematography does right by David Sandefurs handsome production design. And authentic looniness looms when Remy and Beth (Alice Braga) the extensively transplanted and retrofitted girl he is trying to save perform grisly extirpations on one another. Yet ""Repo Men"" is basically a soulless slasher flick and one that demeans its gifted performers. The cast includes Carice van Houten in a small drab role as Remys wife. Youd never guess shes the dazzling Dutch actress who starred as the heart and soul of Paul Verhoevens World War II thriller ""Black Book."" Note to studio get a soul transplant.

"Repo Men Recycled parts but an entertaining whole | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesRepo Men Recycled parts but an entertaining wholeFrankenstein called and he wants his parts back. But Repo Men is into recycling with a vengeance.Jude Law and Forest Whitaker are just a couple of blue-collar ""Union"" workers in Repo Men.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. March 19 2010 Starring Jude Law Forest Whitaker Alice Braga and Liev Schreiber. Directed by Miguel Sapochnik. 111 minutes. At major theatres. 18AFrankenstein called and he wants his parts back. But Repo Men is into recycling with a vengeance.The film is set in the near future where a terrible thing has happened. Theres been some kind of apocalypse stripping Hollywood of new ideas. Article Continued BelowThis leaves rookie helmer Miguel Sapochnik as well as screenwriters Eric Garcia and Garret Lerner with no choice but to make do with refried plot devices about heartless capitalism and mechanized humanity.They take chunks of Blade Runner Logans Run and District 9 add a dollop of Total Recall and fry it up in the lard of Repo The Genetic Opera. Season and serve.The result oddly enough isnt half bad. Sapochnik and his scripters may lack narrative freshness but they possess a flair for visceral visuals and propulsive violence. If you are at all squeamish about scalpels gaping wounds and spurting arteries you may wish to check out The Bounty Hunter this weekend instead.In the cowardly new world of Repo Men science hasnt fixed medicare or the organ donor crisis. Instead it has created mechanical replacements for every human function but these new parts are sold at sky-high prices. A heart costs the price of a house and it comes with an even steeper mortgage failure to pay promptly results in very messy repossession procedures.This brutal recall is the job of guys like Remy (Jude Law) and Jake (Forest Whitaker) ace repo men for organ replacement firm The Union - so named for the sole purpose of allowing the blue-collar body snatchers to say with straight faces ""Were with The Union.""Thats about the level of the comedy in the film which never quite seems to know if its sci-fi horror or the bleakest of satires. The music plays into that latter twitch If youve ever wondered what Molokos dreamy mambo tune ""Sing It Back"" would sound like over top of a scene of someone having his liver forcibly removed wonder no more.The movie long in production and indifferently unleashed was originally titled Repossession Mambo after Garcias source novel of the same name. Its hilariously appropriate that the new title now confusingly resembles about a dozen other repo-themed projects.Equally derivative are plot devices wherein the Union boss (Liev Schreiber) is a soulless profiteer (whod ever have guessed?) and Remy loses his heart to a girl (Alice Braga) who is in hock up to her eyeballs (and I do mean this literally).Yet the fabric of the film holds together despite the awkward stitching. Credit this to the ability of the actors to carry off this dodgy premise without snickering. Law manages a reasonable facsimile of an action hero although hes starting to bear a startling resemblance to Phil Collins. At least a robotic handclap is due to director Sapochnik for working within his limitations (including obvious budgetary ones) and giving this Frankenstein beast as much forward momentum as it possesses. He doesnt even seem to care that we can see the TTC logos on the subway trains used in the movie which was shot in Toronto but is supposed to be set in Anytown U.S.A.Those trains actually seem to be running on time Maybe theres still a bit of creativity left in Hollywood after all.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Title notwithstanding ""Repo Men"" has nothing to do with the Emilio Estevez 1984 cult classic ""Repo Man."" This interminable blood-spattered thriller with Jude Law and Forest Whitaker is more like ""Repo The Genetic Opera"" minus the music and Paris Hilton. In the near future Law and Whitaker are improbable (given their 11-year age difference) former schoolmates working for The Union a corporation that sells patients replacement organs -- and then sends our heroes to yank them out when customers inevitably fall behind on payments. Not for the faint of heart Miguel Sapochniks film includes many bloody close-ups of Law and Whitaker wielding scalpels -- both before and after Law whod planned to find a less demanding line of work wakes up with an artificial heart because of a work-related accident. Its not exactly giving away a surprise to report that when Laws payments are past due their slimy boss (Liev Schreiber) sends the newly svelte Whitaker after him. By this time Law whose wife has left him has gone on the lam with a scavenging drug addict (Alice Braga) with whom he lives in a ruined housing development. Though he seems to be enjoying himself this cable fodder is quite a comedown for former Oscar nominee Law (""Cold Mountain"" ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"") whose last foray into sci-fi was ""A.I. -- Artificial Intelligence."" It doesnt exactly enhance the resume of Oscar winner Whitaker (""The Last King of Scotland"") seen last week in the equally abysmal ""Our Family Wedding."" ""Repo Men"" is a rare film where Toronto plays itself. Its also the first Ive ever seen where a typewriter is used as a lethal weapon.

Starring Jude Law Forest Whitaker Alice Braga Joe Pingue Liev Schreiber Carice van Houten Liza Lapira RZA Chandler Canterbury Yvette Nicole Brown Director Miguel Sapochnik Release Opened Mar 19 2010  Editorial Review Organ du jour SpleenBy John AndersonFriday March 19 2010For all the soullessness of studio pictures where else can todays moviegoer find moral outrage political pluck or a sense of insurrection? Thats right mid- to massive-budgeted sci-fi/horror/fantasy. Theres ""Avatars"" anti-corporatism; ""District 9s"" apartheid allegory; ""The Crazies "" eco-militancy; and now the health-care-gone-haywire nightmare of ""Repo Men."" Could a world actually exist in which artificial organs bought on credit could be repossessed from their delinquent containers by Taser-wielding corporate ninjas? That we can even ask the question makes for a thriller with requisite plausibility and the proper quotient of paranoia.Directed by Miguel Sapochnik who may have watched ""Blade Runner"" a few too many times ""Repo Men"" grafts moral ambiguity onto the action thriller and the result is a weird but likably misshapen beast. The plot may take more unpleasant turns than a small intestine but isnt that what we want out of our suspense films? Throw in Jude Law whom I for one will watch anytime in anything as anyone -- even a guy who leaves his ""clients"" liverless and lifeless -- and one can forgive the movies defects and its indecision about being tragedy or comedy.Law plays Remy the top repo man for the Union a monolithic multinational-cum-government that urges transplants onto ailing customers and then tracks them down when they dont make their payments. The ease with which Remy operates -- evidenced by the old Ramp;B he listens to on his earphones as he removes a bit of this or piece of that -- indicates how good he is and how insulated. When we meet him troubles brewing His wife Carol (an oddly sour Carice Van Houten) wants him to move into sales. Compartmentalizing like a madwoman she thinks it better for him to sell the cursed organs than reclaim them. His Army buddy and fellow repo dude Jake (Forest Whitaker) wants things to remain the same though he shouldnt worry Remy is so obviously not a management guy that his chances of moving up are slim. When Remy has a heart attack he gets a transplant he cant pay for and the hunter becomes the hunted.Sapochniks bloody mess has much in common with ""Repo The Genetic Opera"" Darren Lynn Bousmans 2008 adaptation of the Darren Smith-Terrance Zdunich stage musical. While the campy ""Repo"" was also about repossessed organs screenwriter Eric Garcias novel ""The Repossession Mambo"" is rooted elsewhere -- in ""Brazil"" in ""Death of a Salesman"" in a Kubrick-meets-Burgess vision of a cruel futuristic society. The coincidence is not so odd With the battle over health care raging the idea of buying organs on time from ruthless cutthroat ""providers"" was one of those concepts that was waiting to be hatched and hatched again.In keeping with the trend toward multinational casting ""Repo Men"" has a bit of everywhere about it Besides the Dutch van Houten the English Law and the Americans Whitaker and Liev Schreiber (as a perfect corporate viper) theres Brazils tiny treasure Alicia Braga as Beth the mostly mechanical gamine with whom Remy tries to get off the grid and out of debt. The movie does take a trip into deepest Crazyville A duet of anesthesia-less surgeries performed by Remy and Beth on each other is so borderline orgasmic it may qualify as the horror-fantasy version of a Rogers-Astaire dance number.Contains vulgarity gore violence sexuality and nudity.

"Repo Men movie review A real horror show and not in a good way |       NJ.com comments Repo Men movie review A real horror show and not in a good way Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on March 19 2010 at 402 AM View/Post Comments Kerry HayesJude Law goes to work on a client who has failed to keep current with his payment in ""Repo Men"" a futuristic action-thriller about artificial organ transplants and repossession. What do you call a movie about a giant medical conglomerate that sells human organs on the installment plan -- and if the patients dont pay sends a repo man to collect literally the companys pound of flesh? Well back in 2008 you called it ""Repo The Genetic Opera."" And if you were smart you avoided it. Now in 2010 you call it ""Repo Men."" And if youre very smart you still avoid it. Repo Men (R) Universal (111 min.) Directed by Miguel Sapochnik. With Jude Law Forest Whitaker. Now playing in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys rating One star Ratings note The film contains graphic gore violence and nudity. The new strangely familiar (yet supposedly original) film doesnt share much more with the older cult horror. For one thing it doesnt have any opera. For another it doesnt star Paris Hilton. So its got that going for it. But its just as ugly and revolting as the other movie and just as clueless. The first picture thought it was an outrageous satire. This one thinks its sardonic adult sci-fi. Theyre both wrong. And theyre both awful. Theres not much to the story beyond the basic situation. Remy and Jake are a couple of strong-arm guys who drive around some slightly futuristic landscape hunting down medical deadbeats. And when they find one out come their scalpels. Until the people really are deadbeats. Unless youve already fallen asleep -- which is probably the best way to get through ""Repo Men"" -- you know whats coming next Remy is going to have his own um change of heart and reconsider his lifes work. And company man Jake is going to go after him. Great. Can we go home now? If only. Because at this point we have more than an hour of tedious torture to come including three separate scenes of an artificial kneecap being removed endless stabbings and so many sprays of arterial blood that the sets soon look like Jackson Pollock paintings. As Remy Jude Law looks as if he has ringworm and is trying very hard to remember when he made movies like ""The Talented Mr. Ripley."" As Jake Forest Whitaker amiably confirms that no there is absolutely nothing he will not do. There are a few moments of pleasure thanks to Liev Schreiber as the repo mens boss. Schreiber clearly knows this is offal; he also knows that if he wants to support his family even hit Broadway plays sometimes arent enough. But hes a pro so even as he earns his paycheck he does so with some style and wit. Those are certainly rare commodities in this movie which sacrifices subtlety for the obvious and originality for the tried-and-true -- or more often the tried-and-trite. And a last-minute pull-the-rug-out ending far from being significant is only the last in a long line of copouts. Full of over-the-top violence and misogynist caricatures (including a nagging wife so horrendous even her own son Tasers her) its a film to be endured more than experienced. It succeeds on one level though even in spite of itself It makes at least one clear-cut case for repossession. Taking back the union cards of everyone involved.

"Repo Men | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; repo-men ) Repo Men (United States/Canada 2010) March 19 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Repo Men feels like it was cobbled together using pieces of other often better motion pictures. I could provide a list of titles but it would be more comprehensive simply to state that if a movie is set on a less-than-optimistic future Earth some aspect of it (no matter how minor) probably makes an appearance at some point during Repo Mens nearly two hours. Still despite the familiar nature of the screenplay the direction is crisp enough to engage the attention and there are some enjoyable moments (including an orgy of bloodstained violence) sprinkled throughout. Its tough to recommend Repo Men outright but you could do worse when trolling multiplex halls. Jude Law is Remy and Forest Whitaker is Jake. Paired these two represent the dark side to the futuristic American dream. As the story opens we learn that many elements of human mortality - especially failing organs - are things of the past. But in a world without universal health care theres a price. Transplants are expensive propositions; however like cars they can be paid for on the installment plan. Those who fall behind in their payments can expect to meet the Repo Men - Remy Jake and their fellow workers. They are employed to repossess corporate property using little more than a taser and a very sharp knife. Its bloody business but a jobs a job. Things get dicey however when Remys wife (Carice van Houten) pressures him into seeking a job in sales working alongside the oily Frank (Liev Schreiber) who could sell a refrigerator to an Eskimo. While doing his final repo job Remy suffers a catastrophic accident - one that results in his awakening in a hospital bed with an artificial heart in his ribcage and an expensive debt to be paid off. Having lost his appetite for killing he soon finds himself being chased by his former colleagues with only another fugitive the lovely Beth (Alice Braga) as a companion. As envisioned by first-time feature director Miguel Sapochnik the future is not as bleak a place as one might find in Blade Runner or Brazil but its no Star Trek either. It appears to be a world where corporations rule with an iron fist. Its impossible to miss the satire or the message here. Working from a script co-written by Eric Garcia amp; Garrett Lerner (and based on a novel by Garcia) Sapochnick makes a strong case for what happens when life is just another commodity to be borrowed against and he does so with a macabre sense of humor. There are times when Repo Men feels like a twisted comedy. Even the climax in which blood and gore run freely is presented with a tongue-in-cheek flavor. One problem with Repo Men is that theres not enough material to sustain a 111-minute motion picture. Theres nothing special about most of the action scenes and there are long stretches in which little happens beyond refugees fleeing from corporate enforcers. A little of this goes a long way and theres far too much of it in Repo Men. There were instances when I found myself becoming impatient for something to happen and impatience is rarely a quality I exhibit when a movie has me under its spell. The final 15-20 minutes are sprinkled with small pleasures but it takes an unnecessarily long time to get there. Theres nothing wrong with the acting and although Jude Law isnt a prototypical action hero (any more than Matt Damon was before the Bourne movies) hes a good enough performer to be convincing. Theres some nice chemistry at work here both between Law and Forest Whitaker as his partner and between Law and Alice Braga as his love interest. The connection between Law and Braga is especially effective they make love they support one another and they share knives guns and hacksaws when warranted. Liev Schreiber is delightfully distasteful proving once again that his mere presence in a motion picture can ratchet up its entertainment quotient. Based on the evidence at hand in Repo Men director Sapochnik may have a solid future behind the camera. The movie looks good and the action scenes are presented with clarity and verve. Hopefully for his next project Sapochnik will have something less derivative to work with. Repo Men defeats even his best efforts to elevate it above the level of a passable diversion.

ABOUT THE MOVIERepo Men  1/2 out of four Stars Jude Law Forest Whitaker Alice Braga Liev SchreiberDirector Miguel SapochnikDistributor Universal StudiosRating R for strong bloody violence grisly images language and some sexuality/nudityRunning time 1 hour 51 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY A job is a job. Or so its said -- at least five times in the nasty hackfest that is Repo Men. Hacking is front and center in this tale of skilled tough guys who viciously ""repossess"" artificial body parts when their owners get behind on payments. TRAILER Sneak a peek at Repo Men Theres a whole lot of slicing and dicing by knife scissor saw ax and sundry other implements. Director Michael Sapochnik and screenwriters Erik Garcia and Garrett Lerner have cobbled together this blood-drenched futuristic thriller from a host of more inventive sources Blade Runner Gattaca Repo; the Genetic Opera and even David Cronenbergs 1996 collision-injury creepfest Crash. Nothing about this movie seems original or fresh -- including the repurposed mechanical body parts. Worse the storys internal logic lacks coherence and structure. The Union the company that manufactures and markets these synthetic body parts takes them back by force -- usually killing the patient in the process -- if payments are past due for 90 days. But of what use to this rapacious corporation are extracted fake body parts presumably fitted to personal specifications? And more important what good are dead people for the bottom line? Corporations are all about profits not vengeance. The whole premise is ridiculous. Why good actors like Forest Whitaker and Liev Schreiber have taken major roles in this wrongheaded effort is perhaps the most compelling question posed by this film. Jude Law plays a cheerily efficient and dedicated repo man named Remy. He has a change of heart when he wakes up from a coma to find he has been fitted with a changed heart. Remy has a wife and child and an evolving conscience but hes so casually vicious for most of the movie that its hard to care a jot about what happens to him. Just why so many young middle-aged and seemingly healthy people need transplants and artificial body parts is never fully explained. And squeamish types be warned Sitting through this movie is worse than being locked in a room with a continuous loop of Nip/Tuck playing on a jumbo screen.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Repo Men Science fiction. Starring Jude Law Forest Whitaker and Alice Braga. Directed by Miguel Sapochnik. (R. 111 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Theres a good idea behind ""Repo Men"" not a whole lot of thinking but at least one whole idea. The filmmakers take two notions - that health care is a commodity like anything else and that the health industry has a right to make as much money as the market will bear - and they fashion a nightmare scenario in which those notions are extended to their logical conclusion. The result is a new subgenre for our time health care sci-fi horror. The problem is that as directed by Miguel Sapochnik that fairly interesting little idea ends up in a shotgun marriage with a whole host of action-movie conventions that are either ugly or tired. ""Repo Men"" sets up and puts into motion an attention-grabbing premise and then for the most part just goes to typical places with it. Perhaps its a failure of imagination or perhaps the movie promised more than it ever intended to deliver but a lot of ""Repo Men"" feels like filler - not boring but manufactured with emotions and relationships that are never false but concocted. So the glass is either half full or half empty ""Repo Men"" is either a serious sci-fi film not as smart as it should be or a dumb action movie thats a lot smarter than it had to be. Either way theres something to be said for the world it creates. In the near future synthetic organs will be perfected but if you need a new pancreas it will cost you more than 600000 etc. Photo Kerry Hayes AP Image 1of/3 CaptionClose Image 1 of 3 In this publicity image released by Universal Pictures Alice Braga is shown in a scene from ""Repo Men"".

Photo Kerry Hayes Universal Studios Review Rep Men not quite what doctor ordered 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Of course no business could survive just doing cash sales in such high amounts. Installment plans are necessary to woo middle-income customers. But what happens if someone has an artificial heart installed for example and then decides not to make the payments? Thats where the Repo Men come in. Before the credits even roll Jude Law shows up shoots a delinquent heart patient with a stun gun cuts open his chest and reclaims the synthetic organ. In almost every case (an exception is when theyre only reclaiming one kidney) the repossession results in death but such is the cleverness of the initial scenes that the viewer feels the impulse to get with the spirit anyway and to root for the Repo Men. In one instance Forest Whitaker as Laws partner makes the case that the Repo Men actually save lives by enforcing payments in a life-extending system that would otherwise crash. Later Liev Schreiber as Laws boss echoes this line. Their arguments wont convince most viewers but they sound like arguments that could at least convince somebody. But as much as the movie is about these ideas ""Repo Men"" is even more about the splatter of blood against the wall and a knife through a guys throat about street fights and repeated graphic and often agonizing scenes of knives slowly cutting into flesh. Give Alice Braga credit. When Jude Law reaches into her stomach cavity looking for artificial organs you will believe by the expression on her face that the anesthetic is definitely not working. But at that point the audience will be in pain too. -- Advisory This film contains graphic fights and excruciating scenes of grotesque medical procedures.

"Movie review Repo Men - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MovieMOVIE REVIEW Movie review Repo MenThe futuristic thriller starring Jude Law and Forest Whitaker has its own debt to pay as it borrows heavily from similar and better films.March 19 2010|By Robert Abele Plenty of interior body parts are forcibly removed from reluctant humans in the violent futuristic action film ""Repo Men."" Kidneys hearts livers all high-tech and artificial are taken out and in the movies cautionary premise rented to the medically needy at usury-friendly rates by a nasty corporation called the Union. But theres a key organ missing from the movie itself a brain. In its place is a memory bank of other better movies. Thats a shame because creeping around the edges of ""Repo Men"" is the potential for a funky and prescient piece of gory dystopian satire. For starters its got three game male leads Jude Law as Remy one of the titular enforcers a blue-collar Everyhunk whose task -- if youre a customer overdue on payments -- is to slit you up a treat and retrieve that expensive biomedical breakthrough inside that you thought was prolonging your life; Forest Whitaker as his prankish colleague whod love nothing more than to be a repo forever; and Liev Schreiber as their oily always-be-closing boss the Unions top salesman. When Remy estranged from his wife (a scowling Carice Van Houten) and kid gets hurt on the job and wakes up sporting his own pricey Union ticker and a crushing debt he experiences -- wink wink -- a change of heart about his mean bloody job. Knowing what the day of collecting means Remy and a nightclub singer (Alice Braga) with a hot bod of black-market parts decide they must fight to foreclose on the system instead. But where screenwriters Eric Garcia (adapting his own novel) and Garrett Lerner start off with a nifty sci-fi hybrid of headline-conscious concerns about where subprime blues privacy woes biotechnology and unconscionable healthcare are taking us they and director Miguel Sapochnik would ultimately rather sell you a loud and ludicrous tour of genre references. It starts with John Cleeses ""Can we have your liver then?"" from ""Monty Pythons The Meaning of Life"" and barrels through ""Blade Runner"" (production design) ""Logans Run"" (fugitive scenario) ""Coma"" (all-white room reveal) ""Brazil"" (everything) David Cronenbergs ""Crash"" (dont ask) and even a sub-Tarantino attempt to re-create the virtuoso corridor melee from ""Old Boy."" It takes a more skillful hand than Sapochniks to mix cinematic homage thrills and thematic fluidity -- think ""Minority Report"" or ""Children of Men"" -- which leaves ""Repo Men"" feeling like its own desperate case of debt obligation. calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESForest Whitaker says the message hooked him to Repo MenMarch 18 2010MOVIE REVIEW  Family Business A Mafia Empire With a...November 13 1987MORE STORIES ABOUTMovieEntertainmentDebtRemyCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-repo19-2010mar19,0,5897214.story",200,repomen15,repomen,latimes

Carlos Gonzalez Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint With its radiantly ugly visuals mean-spirited worldview and gut-wrenching levels of gore ""Repo Men"" is about as entertaining as a burst appendix. And yet you can see why the production got a green light from the studio. Projecting the United States health industry to the next level ""Repo Men"" has the framework of a morbid/gonzo science fiction satire like ""Soylent Green"" or ""Idiocracy."" In this misanthropic prophecy artificial organs (artiforgs) can keep you living after your biological parts give out. The catch They cost an arm and a leg. Most patients can only afford them on the installment plan. Fall behind in your payments and the bio- repossession collector retrieves your implants. The tale follows Jude Law as a middle-of-the-food-chain bio-repo man. He likes his work. The moneys good theres a rush to bringing down violators and he meets interesting people. In one episode he lets hip-hop king RZA finish mixing a music track before retrieving his companys property. Irony of ironies when Law is injured on the job he awakens with a mechanical ticker and payments he cant afford. After his change of heart he wants out of the collection racket. And his partner (Forest Whitaker) is now his nemesis. Ah what clockwork ironies Imagine the worst film that could be made from this premise. Now envision something 10 times worse. Thats ""Repo Men."" Its a grade B concept executed with grade Z creative instincts. Former storyboard artist Miguel Sapochnik has never directed a movie before; on the basis of this effort Im not sure hes ever seen a film before. But at least hes got that storyboard day job. The film is further proof of the Oscar Curse for Whitaker whose luck hasnt improved since last weeks fiasco ""Our Family Wedding."" Law is not convincing as a remorseless corporate henchman or as a transformed man of conscience. He is up to the physical challenges of the role however slicing open bodies with a surgical/sadistic relish rarely seen outside snuff films. Moviegoers deserve better. In fact moviegoers deserve a written apology from the producer director and cast. ccovertstartribune.com  612-673-7186 View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

As our hero Remy (Jude Law) explains it ""Cant pay for your house? The bank takes it. Cant pay for your car? The bank takes it. Cant pay for your liver? Well thats where I come in."" Armed with stun gun and scalpel Remy can jack a human organ quicker than a robber can your car radio.Remy a muscle-bound (and somewhat muscle-headed) ex-soldier is a repo man for The Union a corporation that manufactures ""forgs"" (artificial organs) and sells them at agencies resembling car dealerships. When someone defaults on his late-model Jarvik heart Remy pays a house call surgically extracts the property in question and returns it.(The company reaps huge profits in reselling units as its top salesman - played with greedy glee by Liev Schreiber - notes.)As an allegory of rapacious corporate capitalism the movie based on Eric Garcias novel Repossession Mambo has many provocative ideas. But as an account of how for-profit big business literally rips a consumers heart out Repo Men is too graphic for me.Those with a higher threshold for medical procedures than I possess might be able to look past the scenes of organ evisceration and see Repo Men more as a social satire than slasher horror. I watched a third of the movie through the cracks of my fingers wincing.Director Miguel Sapochnik is a former storyboard artist more attentive to how his atmospherics look than to storytelling or acting. He favors sequences of power violence dynamic in a Matrix-y fashion.Besides Law who is sympathetic but not the first guy you think of for this kind of film (though he was excellent in Gattaca) and Schreiber who provides the comic relief amid the spurts and the splatter the film also stars Forrest Whitaker as Remys partner Jake and wistful Alice Braga as Remys rebound romance Beth.As Remy has an artificial heart and Beth artificial almost everything else they are quite the complementary pair. He is a mostly human fighting machine; she is a mostly bionic well of empathy.Their obligatory sex scene which might reduce even David Cronenberg to watching through his fingers cringing involves relieving each other of all their artificial organs and joints bringing new meaning to the term ""organ grinder."" My dear I damn near fainted.P.S. To answer the queries Im getting about the relationship of Repo Men to other similarly titled films Yes it does share the organ-replacement themes of Repo The Genetic Opera. And no it bears no relation whatsoever to Repo Man Alex Coxs 1984 comedy about the automotive bounty hunter who learns that the more you drive the stupider you get.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In a newscast near the beginning of Repo Men an anchor informs her viewers about an ongoing conflict in Nigeria pausing briefly to insert the quick aside ""...thats in Africa."" That fleeting moment says a lot about the world of the movie a place much like ours only slightly dumber. Its a bit more brutal too. The economy remains in the tank dividing the populace into two groups those who have nothing and those just hanging on to what little theyve got. Medicine at least has advanced to the point that most any organ can be replaced by a mechanical equivalent. But health-care reform? Forget it. If you cant pay for the organs youve purchased its back to the warehouse they go. And thats where the repo men come in. Fans of Monty Pythons The Meaning Of Life will see echoes of a famous sequence in the premise and the film--directed by first-timer Miguel Sapochnik and taken from a novel by Matchstick Men writer Eric Garcia--acknowledges the debt by playing a clip from the movie in the background of one scene. Repo Men makes the same dark joke that Python made about the way the value of human life gets lost in the need to balance the books and fill out the paperwork but it doesnt make that point nearly as compactly or as well. Yet for a while Repo Men glides by on style and unrelentingly despairing humor. Jude Law plays a repo man with a nagging wife (an underused Carice van Houten) an overenthusiastic partner (Forest Whitaker) and an unflappably cool professionalism. Law gets an infusion of empathy when an accident on the job leaves him with an artificial heart and all the bills that come with it. Its a too-neat little metaphor--he loses his heart to gain one--and Laws undeveloped portrayal doesnt do much to carry it across. But the films economical plotting an oily performance from Liev Schreiber as Law and Whitakers boss and a brisk pace--up to the endless final act--help patch over some of the flaws. They cant hide the fact that its a film divided against itself however. Sapochnik has made a movie about the delicate dignity of human life that revels in gleeful ultraviolence all of it staged with much less finesse than the rest of the movie (and with one scene that owes way too much to a famous sequence in Oldboy hammer and all). Its a time-waster with brains but ultimately not enough brains and one that wastes too much time.

A ""Minority Report"" for the organ-donor crowd ""Repo Men"" rejects thought-provoking science fiction in favor of a giddy futuristic bloodbath. Set in a world where artificial body parts are all the rage and professional goons come knocking to repossess your spleen this ultra-gory speculative noir is at its infrequent best certifiably nuts; the rest of the time its one numbingly brutal slog. Starring Jude Law as an organ collector who decides to turn the operating tables the Universal release should carve out an appreciative audience among action fans none of whom will require additional brain cells to enjoy it. Entirely unrelated to the 1984 cult hit ""Repo Man"" though bearing some story similarities to 2008s ""Repo The Genetic Opera"" the picture posits a not-so-distant future in which a corporation called the Union manufactures high-tech artificial organs or ""artiforgs."" These are marketed and sold to gullible customers at top prices then violently (and most of the time fatally) reclaimed when they cant pay up. Since Americans are clearly no better at managing their organ debts than their credit-card bills business is booming for Union repo men Remy (Law) and Jake (Forest Whitaker) who are also lifelong pals. As seen in the pics first setpiece -- a combat-heavy raid on a ship full of artiforg recipients long past their final notice -- Remy and Jake are very good at what they do. But when Remys gloomy wife (Carice van Houten never cracking a smile) objects to his job and the example it sets for their young son he decides to move into sales. As fate would have it Remy sustains a serious injury during his last job requiring a heart transplant and making him another Union slave. In a very literal reading of the phrase ""change of heart"" Remy finds he cant do the dirty work anymore -- and since he works on commission hes now racking up major debt. Soon Remys on the run along the way picking up the obligatory sexy/battered love interest Beth (Alice Braga ""I Am Legend"") a drifter who can scarcely call a single body part her own. (Sample pre-seduction dialogue ""What brand are your lips?"" ""Theyre all me."") Together they conspire to bring down the system Remy used to serve while Jake tries to hunt down his friend-turned-renegade. As scripted by Eric Garcia and Garrett Lerner (who developed the screenplay alongside Garcias 2009 novel ""The Repossession Mambo"") ""Repo Men"" could have supported any number of topically resonant spins a perversely comic portrait of capitalism run amok or perhaps an extreme argument for health-care reform. Script does throw off the occasional flash of mordant humor and the climax with its dismayingly unhygienic mix of sex and scalpels is in such jaw-dropping bad taste as to be almost admirable. These potent moments aside the film has neither the intellectual rigor nor the internal consistency needed to make its vision of the future seem even remotely plausible and it short-circuits its more provocative implications in a muddle of conflicting moods. Remy (who wouldnt you know has literary aspirations) provides a running inner monologue lending the picture a half-brooding half-comic tone stranded somewhere between noir and Guy Ritchie; any nuances are ultimately drowned out not only by Marco Beltramis hemorrhaging score but by the bone-crunching intensity of the violence. Earning its R rating and then some ""Repo Men"" boasts more closeup stabbings slashings guttings bludgeonings and scenes of unnecessary surgery than any studio actioner in recent memory. Characters get into knife fights so often its no wonder they all need new organs; one sequence in particular appears to have been repossessed from Park Chan-wooks notorious ""Oldboy"" albeit with blades in lieu of hammers. Slickly choreographed punchily edited sexed up with slow-mo these extended bouts of bloodletting bear out every stereotype of directors who like first-timer Miguel Sapochnik come to feature filmmaking from the world of musicvideos. Leaking stylized geysers of red from every orifice ""Repo Men"" works hard to put the ""art"" in arterial splatter. Thats hardly a compliment. Miscast in an admittedly incoherent role (loving father/aspiring novelist/professional disemboweler) Law delivers a physically energetic turn but doesnt supply much of a rooting interest and his eventual transformation into suspender-clad killing machine plays like a preview of an ill-advised action franchise. Whitaker rings another variation on his familiar persona of cuddly one minute freakishly murderous the next; the ever-bewitching Braga gives the film some much-needed flickers of vulnerability; and Liev Schreiber is supremely oily as the soulless suit who runs the Union. Alternating between glittering nighttime cityscapes (with a pronounced Chinese influence) and rundown housing projects the Toronto-shot pic delivers a future reality thats persuasively low-key but not especially immersive. Juxtaposition of grotesque flesh-cutting sequences with retro tunes like ""Sway"" quickly grows repetitive.

But wait. You have to give the movie time to find its groove and establish its premise In the near future people can live much longer thanks to The Union a manufacturer of artificial organs and body parts. The catch is that the parts dont come cheap - and if you fall behind on your payments The Union will track you down slice you open and reclaim whats theirs the way a bank forecloses on a mortgage. The repossession process often has the unfortunate side effect of leaving the customer dead. ""A jobs a job"" is the way repo men Remy (Jude Law) and Jake (Forest Whitaker) rationalize their gruesome wet work which is tantamount to sanctioned murder. The first half of Repo Men which was written by South Florida natives Eric Garcia and Garrett Lerner and marks the debut of director Miguel Sapochnik is somewhat discombobulating. Theres no one onscreen with whom you can remotely identify or root for - certainly not Remy and Jake who get off on taunting their prey and bragging about their collection quotas while their boss (Liev Schreiber) counts the money and ropes in more suckers. They are repellent loathsome characters no amount of movie-star charisma can overcome. But then around the films midpoint when circumstance forces one of the repo men to consider the other side of their profession something happens The movie goes completely insane in the best way possible. From the scene in which Remy discovers he can plug a set of headphones into the artificial ear of a singer (Alice Braga) he harbors a crush on Repo Men drops all pretensions of social commentary and satire about our health-care system and the economy and becomes a rollicking B-movie with all the sheen and gloss big-budget Hollywood can offer. The less seriously the filmmakers treat their premise the livelier Repo Men becomes (the picture also gets more violent as it goes along; this is an astonishingly gory movie). Beautifully shot by cinematographer Enrique Chediak (28 Weeks Later The Faculty) the film pays homage to its obvious inspirations such as a brief clip of the ""Live Organ Transplants"" segment from Monty Pythons The Meaning of Life (""May we have your liver?"") or a tip of the hat to the hallway fight from Oldboy. But Repo Men ends up finding its own weird outrageous vibe - a dark gory vision of a dystopian future leavened with cracked humor a warped sensibility and a daring spirit. Repo Men bears no relation to 1984s Repo Man except this Here again a cult following is born. Repo Men ( out of ) opens Friday March 19 at South Florida theaters.

Just couldnt get into it. But the screenplay for ""Repo Men"" has been floating around for years. I dont think there was any actual stealing involved. Posted by Rene Rodriguez | March 18 2010 at 1117 AM im loving the Repo Men red band http//bit.ly/91CADA Posted by lilly | March 18 2010 at 0300 PM Hope this one has different with the other action movies. Posted by Dee | March 20 2010 at 1028 AM Repo The Genetic Opera has been around longer than this ripoff first as a ten minute opera then as a stageplay (which one of the creators of Repo Men ATTENDED) and finally as a B-list movie. Get your facts straight Rene. Posted by Anon Scalpel slut | March 20 2010 at 1040 AM Thanks for the info Slut Posted by Rene Rodriguez | March 20 2010 at 0139 PM Which ever came first doesnt negate the fact that The Genetic Opera was kinda shitty. Rene you should check out Triangle when you get a chance. Fun little slasher movie but by the beard of Zues dont watch the trailer (reveals too much).

Repo Men Bad to fair Director Miguel Sapochnik. Cast Jude Law Forest Whitaker Liev Schreiber. Rating R for strong bloody violence grisly images language and some sexuality/nudity. RELATED Spotlight Jude Law Sci-fi favorites Spotlight Forest Whitaker Not to worry. There are plenty of replacements to be had thanks to the Union an outfit that sells livers and kidneys and such. The downside is a lot of desperate people have bad credit spending more than they can afford (perhaps its not a distant future). And thats a problem. The Union you see employs a repossession team - repo men if you will - that pays a visit to those who fall too far behind on their payments and reclaim the company hardware. Its an ugly business but hey its a living. Its an intriguing premise one director Miguel Sapochnik treats with all the subtlety of a head smashed in with a typewriter. Hey wait - that happens As does so much more. If youve ever wanted to see actors of the caliber of Jude Law Forest Whitaker and Liev Schreiber in a brutally violent film soaked in blood and gore this is your dream movie. Law plays Remy a repo man partnered with Jake (Whitaker). Theyre a formidable team whose motto is ""A jobs a job."" It doesnt matter who the client is in other words. Gee wonder if that will come back to haunt them? Remy and Jake work for Frank (Schreiber) the heartless brains of the operation. He doesnt want clients paying in full; the Union doesnt make enough money that way. Better to drag as many payments out of someone as they can before (literally) ripping his lungs out when he no longer can afford them. Remy is paying more attention to his work than to his family. His wife Carol (Carice van Houten) wants him to go into sales but its not clear that Remys cut out for that end of the business. After an accident Remy undergoes a change of heart so to speak and loses his taste for repo work. He helps Beth (Alice Braga) a drug-addicted singer get clean. But Jake isnt sympathetic. Remy is good at what he does he figures and so is he. This is the life they know. Why would Remy want to change it? If this sounds like a statement on health care the economy or the general state of things well its hard to say. Its also hard to think. You dont have a lot of time for such things when theres another overdue esophagus out there just itching to be reclaimed and the repo men are on the case. ""Repo Men"" is more cynical than thoughtful in fact particularly the final act. Theres not a lot of humor here just violence and more violence. The acting is fine enough - Whitaker of the talented bunch seems to be having the best time - but the slicing and dicing overpowers the cast the story and everything else. On the other hand youll probably be more likely to pay your bills on time. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter goodyk.

Law performs this task with such jaunty good cheer that youre not quite sure how to react to him. Then he has a (literal) change of heart He gets a Jarvik implant and becomes one of the hunted. Repo Men however just turns into a grisly one-note chase thriller with Law slaughtering more folks on the run than he ever did as a repo man.

Jude Law and Forest Whitaker are two repo men punching their timecards for The Union Inc. Their job is to hunt down those recipients of synthetic organ transplants whove fallen behind on payments then retrieve company property at the point of a scalpel. (The movie shares this premise with 2008s Repo The Genetic Opera. It would be worth researching who ripped off whom if both werent ghastly.) An on-the-job accident spins Law into midlife crisis; with no stomach left for the bounty-hunting game he decides to drop out of corrupt society with a Hope Sandoval impersonator (Alice Braga). In its 15-hour runtime (authors estimate) Repo Mens nearest thing to an inspired moment is a wound-fisting love scene that might at least appeal to invasive surgery fetishists. The films vision of mercenary foreclosure may have passed as ""eerily prescient"" had it been released somewhere in range of when it started production (fall 2007). As it is this is a poor mans Daybreakers--a phrase Id hoped to go through life without saying--a supercilious inhumanity-of-the-system fable that the invisible hand will mercifully sweep into discount-DVD oblivion.
