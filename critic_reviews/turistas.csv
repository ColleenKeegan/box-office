Starring Josh Duhamel Melissa George Beau Garrett and Olivia Wilde. Directed by John Stockwell. (R. 89 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Its good in a way that ""Turistas"" contains an extended scene in which a girl gets her liver removed with just a local anesthetic. It reminds us that some experiences are even worse than watching this movie. Its also fitting that in a season in which Hollywood offers up its prestige pictures -- the ones it hopes will garner critics prizes and Academy Awards -- ""Turistas"" should come along to offer a bit of contrast. [Podcast Mick LaSalle discusses ""Nativity Story"" ""Turistas"" and ""Dreamland.""] Yet one thing should be said in its favor. On its own cretinous level of aspiration ""Turistas"" succeeds. The goal here seems to have been to make audiences cringe and say ""Eeeuck"" and audiences will do just that and squirm in their seats and look away. But then making people squirm is easy. Just get a camera and a scalpel. Then get a bucket of fake blood and spray the screen with it. The action takes place in Brazil where some of the dumbest young people from the privileged industrialized nations have decided to let loose. From all over the English-speaking world they come -- Australia Britain The United States -- to get drunk and stoned and lie on the beach. We see them cavorting dancing and partying in an early scene which is intended as the happy prelude to disaster. But the scene functions in a deeper more complex way. These people are so stupid that they make us think well wait a second Maybe those livers and kidneys could be put to better use. Maybe the lives of these young folks are in a certain sense just natures way of keeping their organs fresh until the moment comes when they can be harvested. Indeed there was the opportunity here for the filmmakers to make a serious and provocative case for random compulsory organ harvesting as a way of building bridges between the United States and Latin America. But no like the young adults in the movie ""Turistas"" is raucous but hopelessly middle class. It upholds the prosaic notion that everyone is entitled to his own liver even burgeoning alcoholics determined to blow theirs out by age 40. From the beginning these happy-go-lucky youngsters clearly are heading for trouble not only because of the slasher genre but also because of a pre-credits scene in which a girl is heard begging some unseen sadist not to operate on her. That tantalizing glimpse is placed there just in case anyone gets bored by the setup. Its a promise to the audience that no matter what happens someone is going to end up on a slab begging. (Now everybody sing ""Thats entertainment"") The hapless crew is thrown together when eight young survivors of a tour bus accident decide not to sit and wait for another bus but to use the time to have fun. They find a beach and an open bar and they make friends with the locals who actually want to kill them but travelers tend to be naive. Actually heres something odd At the bar the Doomed Eight meet two happy young Swedes who love the beach town so much that theyve lived there three years. Yes for three years no one has bothered them. Yet that very night the Swedes end up tied to a pole and carried off by hostile rain forest villagers. Are we to believe no one in Brazil needed a kidney for three whole years? ""Turistas"" represents the first screenwriting effort by Michael Ross who should stop now. Directed by John Stockwell who shows consummate skill at camera shaking the film stars a young ensemble headed by Josh Duhamel who plays a sensible man who barely wanted to come to Brazil in the first place and certainly didnt want to take the bus. Thats just the sort of reluctance that bodes well for survival the opposite of lustful exuberance always a sure ticket to the operating room. -- Advisory Sexual situations drug use enthusiastic drinking nudity shootings and extreme disturbing gore.

Olivia Wilde from left Melissa George and Josh Duhamel star in Turistas. Photo Fox Atomic Turistas 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Turistas looks touristy in its ads all right its grisly destination visited by too many recent horror flicks. Happily thats just the marketing for unlike Saw Wolf Creek Hostel and their ilk Turistas concerns more than torture. It explores far broader turf and includes side trips to the realm of action thrillers. Though excruciating scenes -- with shiny scalpels and strapped-down ""patients"" -- erupt theyre a tiny part of a bigger picture. The victims are allowed to fight back -- possibly even to escape -- which makes this more a harrowing adventure than a punishing gorefest. The victims are luckless Americans and Brits who take a bus into Brazils remote reaches. The bus crashes and theyre stranded but they make the best of things by partying with the locals. Well not quite. When they wake from drugged stupors to find they were robbed the high-spirited young adults suddenly get serious. Realizing theyre up a long Brazilian creek they eagerly trust potential saviors and wind up in even worse shape. Meet Zamora (Miguel Lunardi) a devilish doctor who systematically nabs unsuspecting gringos and harvests their organs for needy Brazilians. This way he figures to balance the scales against greedy exploitative Americans -- or something. The shaky premise would have worked better if the murdering maniac had been greed-driven and not a warped altruist. But at least John Stockwell who directed isnt all about suffering. Instead his film is a tight kinetic thriller. Even the bad guys -- including the liver-loving doctor from hell -- show character development. His victims arent ugly Americans so much as naive but harmless hedonists. Theyre essentially decent so its easy to invest in them especially Alex (Josh Duhamel) a dutiful protective hero type. Their travails are rigorous and eventful but where Stockwell stumbles is in sustained action scenes on dark and stormy nights and in dark and watery caverns. Theyre tough to follow as folks run or swim past one another in the murk. But Ill take creepy claustrophobia over excruciating torture any day. Saw? Saw it -- and this is better. Consider it a modern spin on Deliverance with no squealing like a pig -- just squeals of frightful excitement. bruce.westbrookchron.com Todays Deals Upcoming LEGO Apple Mini Build for free w/ registration Kitchen and Bath at Home Depot Up to 40% off + free shipping...

"Turistas is more splash than slash - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Events    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Turistas is more splash than slash By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  December 1 2006 So lets see. Youre in the hinterlands of Brazil and the bus youve been on for hours just toppled over the side of a hill. Itll be at least another half a day until the next one comes. But you see a pair of girls walking down the road sipping fruity drinks and forgetting that youre stranded but not that youre on vacation you hike for your own fruity drink. Back home youd go to a Jamba Juice but here you turn up a cabana next to a shimmering oasis.The beer is plentiful and the hip-hop seductive so you your cute sister her hot blond friend some Australian chick (obligatorily in cornrows but crucially a Portuguese speaker) and two mates from London (one far more exasperating than the other) drink and dance. But when you wake up the next day someones run off with everything including your groups common sense.Through jungles and shantytowns you drift wet and shoeless without a clue that the friendly local who came to your rescue after one of the Brits hit a kid with a rock is leading you to a fate worse than any Brazilian wax. Yet in spite of the oncoming doom (even the hawks circling above know whats up) you simply cannot pass up the opportunity to jump in a big blue lake. Forget imminent death -- look a waterfallNo despite what the previews promise and what the cast of young white hotties youve mostly never heard of before would lead one to expect (TVs Josh Duhamel being excused) ""Turistas"" is not a slasher film -- not conventionally. Released by Foxs new teen division its the latest aquatic titillation from John Stockwell the man who also brought us ""Blue Crush"" and the shockingly good ""Into the Blue.""Stockwell has no use for cheap scares and bloodbaths. Its possible that Michael Arlen Ross wrote this script aiming for a queasy Yanks-abroad exploitation picture one akin to last years ""Hostel."" Instead he gets an exploitation flick closer to MTVs ""Real World/Road Rules Challenge"" skin shouting swimming.""Turistas"" has only hints of the unforeseen soulfulness of ""Into the Blue."" Jessica Alba Paul Walker and Scott Caan cut sexily through that thrillers Caribbean Sea like gym-toned merpeople. ""Turistas"" is at least absorbing and only sometimes beyond the pale. Sure Brazils endless caste tensions provide a sort of deus ex machina but the villain is one of those cerebral sadists who enjoys prattling away while he cuts. And Stockwell demonstrates an unsettling interest in the stomach-turning -- staples to a gash wood skewers to the eye -- like a man desperate to score with the Fangoria crowd.Naturally his moviemaking only comes truly alive when waters added which is good news for the suspenseful undersea climax that comes after a long tropical downpour. H2O for Stockwell promises an entirely other universe a dimension thats beautiful obviously but ominous too. With ""Turistas"" hes stuck with a silly plot and characters that make you sometimes wish the movie were a cheap slasher picture after all. But water here makes even these endangered mannequins seem worth saving.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/movies/blog.

Yanks vacationing way South-of-the-border face a fate far worse than stomach cramps and diarrhea in ""Turistas."" Indie pickup is first release for youth-slanted genre shingle Fox Atomic and with an advertising budget reportedly three times the pics 10 million production cost this ""Hostel""-with-a-tan-line is sure to soak up some counter-programming cash in a seasonal marketplace currently short on horror fare. The unsavory effort will doubtless be Christmas trash soon enough but ancillary life should raise its cast casualties from the dead for further monetary gain by Easter. The ""Hostel"" similarities may strike some as too close for comfort not only in plot outline but also in general mix of xenophobia sexploitation sadism and gore. Like Eli Roths soon-to-be-sequelized hit this knockoff is more icky than scary with a rather obnoxious Ugly American as lead protagonist. Pics simple advice to viewers who might want to wander in the non-Michelin-Guided world For gods sake dont do it They hate us Not only do those foreigners speak crazy non-speakee-English lingos but half of them are crazies and sickos Anyone judging the U.S. by its movies -- as millions do -- will likely decide this latest horror trend makes us look pretty damn dumb. After opening teaser of coming gory attractions a rapid-fire credits montage encapsulates pics perspective on Latin America as Tantalizing Pleasures vs. Harrowing Squalor. Bossy Alex (Josh Duhamel) has been dragged along to chaperone sister Bea (Olivia Wilde) and pal Amy (Beau Garrett) on their tour of off-the-beaten-path Brazil. The path at present is a winding coastal road which their bus driver careens along heedlessly. When Alex yells at the lead footed driver the girls tell him to shut up. But moments later they all barely escape before the vehicle totters off an embankment. They are told a replacement bus wont arrive for hours. Now joined by randy Brits Finn (Desmond Askew) and Liam (Max Brown) plus Portuguese-fluent Aussie Pru (Melissa George) the Yanks head for a nearby beach bar. Indeed the beach proves so gorgeous they decide to miss their bus and stay overnight. Much revelry ensues but next morning the friendly locals -- along with the tourists luggage cash and passports -- are long gone. They look for help but inadvertently provoke nearby villagers and are urged by new buddy Kiko (Agles Steib) to scram into the jungle where hes got a ""safe"" house they can stay in until the next transit comes. Natch this house is a very long isolated walk away. Upon arriving (after a pit stop to explore semi-submerged caves behind a waterfall) the visitors find suspicious items galore Surveillance cameras an excess of medical supplies caged dogs and a cache of tourist passports. Uh-oh. Then sinister Dr. Zamora (Miguel Lunardi) arrives by helicopter and hints of a murderous organ-transplant trade prove true as during the next 15 minutes (arriving almost exactly an hour in) the protags ranks thin rapidly. Horror fans pleased by this turn may feel cheated when ""Turistas"" then spends its final quarter-hour back in the underwater caves with a whole lotta anxious swimming rather than more horrific action. While this too is unpleasant (in a fear-of-drowning way) its more like a sequel to aquatic thriller ""Into the Blue"" (helmer John Stockwells last pic) than ""Hostel"" or even cave-bound chiller ""The Descent."" Result is ultimately silly and forgettable. Still if it lacks ""Hostels"" distinctive sleaziness ""Turistas"" does have one idea as offensive as anything in that gagfest Zamora explains he yanks organs from (still-conscious) ""gringo American tourists"" and donates them to a Rio Peoples Hospital in order to ""even the scales"" against First World imperialism. (Thanks for this tasteless ""irony"" should be addressed to first-time scenarist Michael Arlen Ross.) Of course Zamora later barks ""You stupid Indian do what I say I OWN you"" at a dark-skinned flunky. No doubt Brazil (where pic was actually shot) will enjoy its depiction here just as much as the Czech Republic did ""Hostel."" Locations and widescreen lensing are attractive tech aspects overall a cut above B-grade horror average. Cast is well-toned.

"Turistas | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; turistas ) Turistas (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Turistas starts out as an effective little horror movie before devolving into an incoherent mess during its final 30 minutes. The problem isnt the body count its the inability to figure out what the number is due to the way in which director John Stockwell has chosen to film his payoff scenes. Theres room here for suspense but its hard to generate tension when the viewer cant figure out whats going on. Darkness and rain are great when it comes to establishing atmosphere but theyre not so great when filming action sequences. It doesnt take long before it becomes impossible to figure out whos chasing whom and whos about to face the wrong end of a sharp object. In the end everything becomes clear but the path to that conclusion is long dark dripping and frustrating to navigate. Irrespective of how the climactic chase scenes were shot Turistas was never going to ascend to the pinnacle of the mountain of modern cinematic horror but it would have been easier to recommend. The lengthy setup which takes about one hour is suitably ominous - derivative to be sure but creepy nonetheless. The characters variations on a theme are likable despite their lack of depth. This is in contrast to Hostel a movie to which Turistas can easily be compared (both feature backpackers in a foreign country being duped by the locals) in which the protagonists were jerks. In addition to Hostel Turistas borrows from Wolf Creek (more dumb tourists) and The Descent (cave action). The film isnt as good as the latter two but it is a slight improvement over Eli Roths gory misfire. For those who want a little more out of their horror movies this one comes complete with a political message about the greed and arrogance of Americans. The six main characters (also known as Fodder for Homicidal Natives) are brought together in a rural area of Brazil when their bus doesnt quite make a turn. They get out okay but the vehicle is a write-off taking a long tumble down a steep embankment. Alex (Josh Duhamel) is on vacation with his sister Bea (Olivia Wilde) and her wild friend Amy (Beau Garrett). Pru (Melissa George) a wanderer by nature is a long way away from her native Australia. And Finn (Desmond Askew) and Liam (Max Brown) are visiting from the U.K. looking for wine and women. Instead of waiting for the replacement bus these four decide to investigate rumors of an ultra-secret private beach and bar. This supposed paradise turns into something different when they are drugged and robbed. They wake up half naked and have to trek through ten hours of wilderness to arrive at a safe house. (Joseph Conrad fans do not get excited this is not Hearts of Darkness.) What they dont know is theyre being led into a trap run by a mad doctor with an ax to grind (literally) about organ harvesting. Director John Stockwell who has been stuck on the color ""blue"" for his recent films (Blue Crush Into the Blue) moves into darker territory - both literally and figuratively. The forests of Brazil are filmed with an eye toward menace rather than as scenic destinations. One suspects the Brazilian Tourist Board will not be pleased. Stockwell appears to be more interested in suspense than gore for gores sake. Theres some of that but its not gratuitous. Other horror conventions abound. There are a few bare breasts (although the longest exposure occurs during a scene that is anything but titillating) and characters act in predictably stupid ways. This is annoying but one has to recognize that if the protagonists behaved intelligently it would be a short boring movie. The cast is comprised of young good looking actors. Lead hunk Josh Duhamel has some motion picture experience (he was the title character in Win a Date with Tad Hamilton) but is best known for a lead role in the TV series Las Vegas. Melissa George is not a horror neophyte having previously appeared in the remake of The Amityville Horror. Before that she was a semi-regular in Alias. Olivia Wilde comes to Turistas from The O.C. Beau Garrett has limited previous experience which explains why shes the one chosen to show her breasts. Both Desmond Askew and Max Brown have done a lot of U.K. television. They also show their chests but the effect isnt the same. Turistas delivers just about everything a viewer expects from a horror movie except a well-lit conclusion. Admittedly there is fine line between using darkness to set a tone and having it result in the obfuscation of everything by going for an authentic look and Stockwell ends up on the wrong side of that demarcation. When frustration trumps suspense something is wrong. Respect for an audience demands a certain amount of clarity especially during the climax and Stockwell doesnt deliver.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Ugly Disemboweled Americans What the horror-show Turistas has in common with Babel. Plus Remembering Robert Altman. By David Edelstein Published Oct 25 2007 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Fox Atomic) The awful offal-ridden Turistastextbook torture-pornwould be too disgusting to discuss were it not for its efficiency at exploiting the fear that haunts our post-Iraq American dreams and that can be discerned in works as various as the Oscar-bait ensemble drama Babel and the cringe comedy Borat how our combination of arrogance and ignorance has left us hideously vulnerable in a world that hates our guts. Turistas directed by John Stockwell from a script by Michael Arlen Ross opens with a tease of whats to come a young woman pleading for her life on an operating table the image of her surgeon reflected in her eyeballplus a lot of squishy sounds. Then comes the foreplay as we flash back to our three American protagonists (Josh Duhamel Olivia Wilde Beau Garrett) who pass up the plane for a rickety bus through the mountains of Brazil with every smiling Brazilian child a potential defiler. Hovering in the air is the joke that if you speak two languages youre bilingual three youre trilingual and one youre American Who the hell knows what these alien others are thinking? BACKSTORY Brazil isnt thrilled with the Turistas trailer which flashes the lines In a country where anything goes anything can happen. Says Miguel Jeronimo of New Yorks Brazilian tourism office Its not whatever goes in our country This isnt the first time Brazil has taken issue with its portrayal. In 2002 a Simpsons episode showed Brazil as filled with bisexual men and mad monkeys. After a tourism agency threatened to sue the producers issued this statement We apologize to the lovely city and people of Rio de Janeiro and if that doesnt settle the issue Homer Simpson offers to take on the president of Brazil on Foxs Celebrity Boxing. It is of course a familiar hack-em-up premise nubile Americans far from home (or in the case of backwoods Americana chainsaw movies from the city) at the mercy of savages who want to punish them forwhat? Their freedom as our president would have it? Possibly their sexual freedom. As usual theres a streak of murderous puritanism in the carnage You know the leggy blonde with the big boobs will get the chop because she says things like Would you guys mind if I went topless? Wed be livid. But in this case its more like the freedom to exploit the rest of the world. In the angry probing Three Kings an Iraqi soldier lectures an American on the real motives of Desert Storm while pouring oil down his throat. Turistas gives you the sleazy gutbucket variation a Brazilian doctor who lectures an American woman on all that the U.S. has taken from his countryland sugar gold sexual innocencewhile removing her organs one by one in close-up. He adds hed take everything if he could including the skin from your ugly white asses. Theres only one surgery scene but its the heart (and kidneys) of Turistas. The restespecially the incoherent actionfalls well below the mark set by the last Americans Abroad torture-porn picture Hostel. During the murky underwater climax I was saddened to see the nominal hero meet his untimely endonly to discover it was actually a bad guy whod been skewered. Ineptitude spoils payback how American. I stumbled out thinking of Babel Turistas art-house correlative in which an American couple travels through Morocco in an air-conditioned tour bus distracted by petty little marital problems She takes a bullet to the chest while back in affluent San Diego their pale little moppets are whisked across the border by their (illegal) nanny and surrounded by tequila-swilling gun-firing Mexicans. In my fantasy they bump into Borat who pretends to investigate the secret of Americas greatness while demonstrating Americas cluelessness. And so the Third World bleeds closer ever closer into our own. Robert Altman allegedly said hed direct movies until his last breath and that note of orneriness was his leitmotif No one was going to tell him what he could or couldnt do. Sometimes he joked that he didnt do much of anything anywaya lie with a half-kernel of truth. Altman certainly didnt direct the way others did. He assembled ecosystems (platoons of gifted actors with vast histrionic reserves) set them in motion and pointed a camera (often two cameras) and a microphone (actually many microphones) at them. He would sift through hours of vocal tracks for the words he wanted you to registerBob Balaban his collaborator on Gosford Park marveled that Altman made choices in seconds that would have taken someone else months. He was a Zen director. His camera stood coolly back from the exhibitionistssometimes contemptuously (if the characters were right-wingers or hypocrites or snobs) more often with wonder. Altman started in TV but the style we know him byensemble casts and overlapping lickety-split dialoguedates from MASH that Vietnam-era military comedy that brought a hip new counterculture sensibility to cinema. What drew him to the subject was the notion of rogue (and roguish) individualists creating their own moral universe one that transcended brainless military protocol and sham piety. It was also one that attracted free spiritsactors who wanted to be part of his communal experiments audiences who wanted movies with less formula and more texture. The great critic and painter Manny Farber once wrote of the dispersed frame of movies of the early seventies with directors like Altman striving to capture the freshness and energy of a real world. That hubbub the actors seeming to have been caught on the fly can make you laugh out loud. It isnt chaos though Altman had the tightest loose frame in the business. 1 2 Next Share this story...
