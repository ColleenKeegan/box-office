Chris ODonnell is Jimmy a young man with a morbid fear of getting hitched. Renee Zellweger is his girlfriend who is less than awed by his proposal ""You win."" She bails just as Jimmy learns he will inherit 100 million from his late grandfather (a hammy Peter Ustinov) - provided he marries by his 30th birthday. Which is tomorrow. ODonnells desire to play bad (or at least not adorable) and Zellwegers yen to play light (or at least not snuffly) are admirable. But as hectically directed by Gary Sinyor (""Stiff Upper Lips"") from a labored screenplay by Steve Cohen the two are uneasily stuck together like strangers united by a Moonie minister. The climax in which a thousand wannabe brides chase Jimmy would look great in a 1950s (or Buster Keaton) comedy. But the mood is ruined by the bitchy 1990s stereotyping of the husband hunters - including a militant fat one a pathetic old one and even you bet a big-mama black one. Just say I dont.

Comments The Bachelor In this romantic comedy a remake of the 1925 Buster Keaton movie Seven Chances Jimmy (Chris ODonnell) has 24 hours to get married if he wants to fulfill the terms of his grandfathers will and inherit 100 million--and viewers have almost two hours to become thoroughly disgusted. To justify a happy ending without making the characters strictly mercenary the movie vaguely suggests that the family business will go under and employees will lose their jobs if Jimmy doesnt meet the challenge. He and his cronies are portrayed as if there were only two types of men--the marrying kind and the other kind. But except for an iconic castrating bitch who lacks modesty and maternal instincts (Brooke Shields) every woman in the movie--and there are hundreds maybe thousands--is the marrying kind. After several of them accuse Jimmy of prejudice he instantly becomes a sensitive guy sheepishly conceding that he prefers blonds--just in time to marry one. Gary Sinyor directed a screenplay by Steve Cohen.

You dont have to know and love Buster Keatons inspired 1925 farce ""Seven Chances"" to dislike the modern remake ""The Bachelor"" although it certainly doesnt hurt. A remarkably mirthless and inept romantic comedy about a young man who must marry within a day if hes to inherit  100 million new pic is woefully misconceived on virtually every level as it retains awkward vestiges of its source without at least winking at them or better yet coming up with plausible contemporary substitutes. In this box-office year anything is possible but likeliest commercial fate is an OK opening spurred by a fun romantic sell followed by rapid falloff based on grim word of mouth. The most memorable sight in Keatons zippy comedy was that of dozens if not hundreds of prospective brides in hot pursuit of the stone-faced would-be heir through the streets. Action climax of this new version reproduces this image and predictably magnifies it as fully 1000 bridal-gowned women race up and down the steep hills of San Francisco in very uncomfortable shoes attempting to get their hands on the most eligible bachelor in town. But whereas the sequence in the Keaton picture became a hilarious silent movie classic the current equivalent not only lacks comic invention but leaves a rather sour taste by casting the women as ghastly and grasping harridans quite out of time place and synch with the contempo context. Problems start about 90 minutes earlier. Jimmy Shannon (Chris ODonnell also aboard as exec producer) is a good-looking but otherwise uninteresting confirmed bachelor who after three years with g.f. Anne (Renee Zellweger) reaches the relationship crossroads where its time to ""shit or get off the pot."" When he proposes to Anne by using these very words she understandably storms off in a huff which leaves Jimmy in the lurch when the videotaped will of his grandfather (a blustery American-accented Peter Ustinov) reveals that he will receive 100 very big ones only if he marries by 605 p.m. on his 30th birthday. Naturally his birthday is the very next day. After his financial adviser (Hal Holbrook) gets off one of scripter Steve Cohens few clever lines (""What is this Brewsters Millions? "") Jimmy rushes off to propose to Anne once again this time enthusiastically.Shes still not convinced so Jimmy spends most of the remaining 27 hours tracking down some of his former girlfriends and discovering to his distress just how unmercenary they are. All but one. Hardened heiress Buckley (Brooke Shields) her family fortune fading is amenable to Jimmys enticing business arrangement but bolts when she learns of the strings attached They must remain married for 10 years and produce genetically verifiable offspring. With this rejection Jimmy all but gives up hope the landslide of willing brides materializing only as the result of a surprise newspaper article on his birthday. The accumulation of minor lapses inconsistencies and unimaginative thinking eventually creates evidence of a major creative deficiency. Why would crafty old Grandpa leave a recorded will specifying that Jimmy must marry by his 30th birthday when he could easily have outlived it? Why havent the characters of Holbrooks folksy broker Edward Asners bottom-line family attorney Artie Langes tubby best friend and most of all James Cromwells patient priest all of whom accompany Jimmy on his rounds been reconceived in modern terms rather than seeming like holdovers from some middling 30s screwball comedy? Why does Jimmy have to be motivated to marry for the money in order to save the jobs of the 200-odd employees of his billiards table company -- people we scarcely see and feel nothing for -- in what seems like a hangover device from a Depression-era Frank Capra film? Why does the film pretend that there are passenger trains that run directly from Napa into downtown San Francisco a conspicuous plot contrivance? (And what did Amtrak offer to have the train in question not only arrive on time but early?) And why recycle the old gag of the newspaper headline when significant fun could have been generated by posting news of Jimmys predicament on the Internet? Just as the plot mechanics could have been retrofitted to a far greater extent so could the characters have been given more interest and dimension. ODonnells Jimmy is as bland as bland can be and thesp lacks the comic chops to add humor to his bungled proposals to Anne and to his encounters with former flames. Latter are largely confined to single scenes in which the actresses uniformly push toward arch unattractive caricature evidently with the approval of director Gary Sinyor (""Stiff Upper Lips"" ""Leon the Pig Farmer""). Similarly Zellweger comes off much less well here than in her other major films her sprightly but vulnerable winsomeness being no match for the pictures crass simplistic formulations. Visual package is rather dull and unappealing while soundtrack is overloaded with pop tune snippets many of them chosen for their groaningly obvious thematic relevance to the matters at hand. Attribution of the pictures sources is evasively buried deep in the end credits scroll.

Starring Chris ODonnell and Renee Zellweger. Directed by Gary Sinyor. Written by Steve Cohen. (PG-13. 101 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) You wont see Brooke Shields name in the credits for ""The Bachelor"" the Chris ODonnell movie that opens today but shes probably the best reason to see this lackluster filmed-in-San Francisco romantic comedy. Shields plays Buckley a dark- haired viper and one of several ex- girlfriends that ODonnell begs to marry him. The least marriageable of the lot Shields says yes to marshmallowy ODonnell only because her familys fortune is depleted. He cant stand her but hes up a creek. His late grandfather (Peter Ustinov) left him 100 million but stipulated that he marry before his 30th birthday -- just one day away -- or else forfeit the cash. Villains and bitches are always the juiciest parts and Shields whose years on the ""Suddenly Susan"" sitcom are apparently paying off knows this. In the best scene of ""The Bachelor"" she nearly marries ODonnell but then disrupts the ceremony cringing and lighting a cigarette each time she hears one of the provisions left by ODonnells grandfather. No. 1 Groom and bride must live together. No. 2 They must stay together 10 years. No. 3 They must bear children. ""The Bachelor"" was inspired by ""Seven Chances"" a silent Buster Keaton classic that makes this update directed by Gary Sinyor look labored by comparison. Like ""Seven Chances"" ""The Bachelor"" climaxes when a horde of would-be brides having heard about the heir in a newspaper story chase the hapless hero through town. This sequence got a lot of publicity when it was being filmed here and 1000 extras each wearing a different wedding dress stampeded across Washington Square Park down Grant and Columbus and up and down the citys hills in pursuit of ODonnell. Its a funny image. Of course our guy has a sweetheart he really wants to be with played by the appealing Renee Zellweger but he keeps blowing it with her. Hes a commitment-phobe. Hes all thumbs emotionally. ""Seven Chances"" was made in 1925 and the remainder of the century has brought such cynicism and sex-role confusion in life and in movies that ""The Bachelor"" turns the Keaton figure into a die-hard bachelor who fancies himself a ""mustang."" Instead of submitting to the ""ball and chain"" of marriage ODonnell wants to run free -- and prides himself on the fact that his buddies all bit the dust before he did. Thats a pretty lame premise for a movie retrograde sexism in the service of dumb laughs. But for viewers who find humor in men who regard women as emasculating predators and agree that moist-eyed women who speak of ""the future"" are deeply scary ""The Bachelor"" may be a passable way to waste an evening. ""The Bachelor"" expects us to like ODonnell at the same time it gives him caveman values. Cliches about marriage-as-imprisonment arent funny coming out of him -- not only because theyre tired but also because ODonnell is such a soft squishy vanilla kind of guy. A comic actor like Mike Myers or Jon Lovitz might have redeemed this material but not ODonnell. Ustinov who has just two scenes as his grandfather is another story. Disguising his rounded British diction with a hick American accent Ustinov makes crotchetiness amusing and delivers lines about ""the cold chaste loveless shell called marriage"" with a zest and a sense of absurdity that ODonnell could only imagine. ..

"The Bachelor Hey Baby Want to Marry a Guy Worth 100 Million? November 5 1999 FILM REVIEW The Bachelor Hey Baby Want to Marry a Guy Worth 100 Million? Related Articles The New York Times on the Web Current Film Video Selected Scenes and Trailer From the Film The Bachelor Forum Join a Discussion on Current Film By STEPHEN HOLDEN nmarried men are like wild mustangs charging lustily through life in a continual search for new varieties of sweet succulent grasses announces Jimmy (Chris ODonnell) the smirking narrator of ""The Bachelor"" a crude frantic farce satirizing yuppie mating rituals in the age of the cigar bar. Thin-lipped and shifty-eyed with too-slick hair and a blandly handsome baby face that is just beginning to get a little puffy ODonnell suggests a swinging 90s variant of what used to be called a ""button-down man."" He strongly resembles the young Bob Newhart who in the early 1960s recorded a series of best-selling comedy albums from the perspective of ""the button-down mind."" Jimmys rampaging bachelor life is threatened when he realizes that he can no longer delay popping the question to his fun-loving curly-haired sweetheart Anne (Renee Zellweger) whom he has been dating for three years. But when the big moment presents itself over Champagne in a fancy restaurant while a singer aggressively shouts ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"" over Jimmys shoulder his words come out wrong. ""You win"" he says to Anne with a sneaky grin as he pulls out an engagement ring. Anne deeply stung by his not-so-latent hostility storms off in a fury. Ms. Zellwegers Anne is a likable variation of what threatens to become her stock screen persona a stubborn quirky tomboyish ingenue who beneath her defensive exterior turns out to be a blubberingly sentimental old-fashioned girl. But when Jimmys crusty grandfather dies leaving a will stipulating that his grandson must marry by 30 or forfeit a 100 million inheritance Jimmy is thrown into a panic because that birthday turns out to be just 27 hours away. But Anne still smarting cant be budged from her refusal. Jimmy armed with bouquets and riding around San Francisco in a limousine with a minister (James Cromwell) ready to perform a wedding ceremony at a moments notice bombards one ex-girlfriend after another with a last-minute proposal and is turned down. In the comedys climactic scenes a classified newspaper ad placed by Jimmys pal Marco (Artie Lange) draws a stampeding horde of prospective brides all wearing white to the church. As they chase Jimmy through the streets of San Francisco they become the female equivalent of Jimmys wild mustangs. ""The Bachelor"" directed by Gary Sinyor from a screenplay by Steve Cohen was adapted from a 1925 Buster Keaton classic ""Seven Chances."" Once the movie gets going it builds up some of the zip of a silent-film comedy although its satire is too broad to carry much of a sting. But occasionally the screenplay succeeds in slipping in a zinger. The bridal mob that briefly corners Jimmy in the church turns out to be a savvy multicultural cross section of San Franciscan women. Pelting Jimmy with questions about his preferences they sneeringly challenge him to deny that what he wants is a ""skinny blonde."" Except for one woman whom Jimmy remembers as being ""too clinging"" his exes are a spunky self-determined bunch who dont fall into a swoon at the prospect of being legally joined to 100 million. They include a stockbroker a chef a narcissistic opera singer (Mariah Carey) and an icy socialite (Brooke Shields). Most are caricatures of late-90s workaholics. For all its obsession with marriage bachelorhood man chasing and ""breeding"" (as one character puts it) ""The Bachelor"" isnt the least bit sexy. Drenched in an atmosphere of materialistic frenzy the movie is only excited about one thing going for the gold. PRODUCTION NOTES The Bachelor is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has off-color humor and strong language. THE BACHELOR Directed by Gary Sinyor; written by Steve Cohen; director of photography Simon Archer; edited by Robert Reitano; music by David A. Hughes and John Murphy; production designer Craig Stearns; produced by Lloyd Segan and Bing Howenstein; released by New Line Cinema. Running time 90 minutes. WITH Chris ODonnell (Jimmy) Renee Zellweger (Anne) Artie Lange (Marco) Edward Asner (Gluckman) Hal Holbrook (ODell) James Cromwell (Priest) Mariah Carey (Ilana) Brooke Shields (Buckley) and Peter Ustinov (Grandad).

Chris ODonnell is Jimmy a young man with a morbid fear of getting hitched. Renee Zellweger is his girlfriend who is less than awed by his proposal ""You win."" She bails just as Jimmy learns he will inherit 100 million from his late grandfather (a hammy Peter Ustinov) - provided he marries by his 30th birthday. Which is tomorrow. ODonnells desire to play bad (or at least not adorable) and Zellwegers yen to play light (or at least not snuffly) are admirable. But as hectically directed by Gary Sinyor (Stiff Upper Lips) from a labored screenplay by Steve Cohen the two are uneasily stuck together like strangers united by a Moonie minister. The climax in which a thousand wannabe brides chase Jimmy would look great in a 1950s (or Buster Keaton) comedy. But the mood is ruined by the bitchy 1990s stereotyping of the husband hunters--including a militant fat one a pathetic old one and even you bet a big-mama black one. Just say I dont.
