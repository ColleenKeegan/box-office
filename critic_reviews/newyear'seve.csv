Pictures Photo Credit Andrew Schwartz/ advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A couple dozen New Yorkers criss and cross on the last day of the year. BOTTOM LINE A charmless soulless cash-in from the people who sold you ""Valentines Day"" CAST Hilary Swank Ashton Kutcher Sarah Jessica Parker Zac Efron Michelle Pfeiffer LENGTH 157 From the people who sold you last years ""Valentines Day"" comes ""New Years Eve"" another jumbled romantic comedy made of expensive stars and cheap corn. The first film had split-second glimmers of charm but no such luck in this quick dash for box-office cash. Screenwriter Katherine Fugate again whips up a dozen cutesy mini-plots this time set against a touristy-looking New York City on Dec. 31 and director Garry Marshall again hands out roles seemingly at random. Among the almost-interesting stories are a young bike messenger (Zac Efron) helping an aging secretary (Michelle Pfeiffer) with a list of resolutions; a single mom (Sarah Jessica Parker) wrangling her rebellious teenager (Abigail Breslin); and a race between the Byrnes (Jessica Biel Seth Meyers) and the Schwabs (Sarah Paulson Til Schweiger) to squeeze out the years first baby (Carla Gugino is the exasperated doctor). Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? But Marshall wastes his best actors and spends his time unwisely. Robert De Niro and Halle Berry do basic hack work as a dying journalist and a kindly nurse; Katherine Heigl and Jon Bon Jovi have zero chemistry as a brokenhearted caterer and -- surprise -- a famous rocker; Ashton Kutcher the movies main dish gets sidelined here as a grouchy slacker trapped in an elevator with an aspiring singer (Lea Michele). Josh Duhamels vapid playboy and Hilary Swanks Times Square staffer (shes in charge of the big ball) are impossible to care about but suck up much of the movie. Despite Marshalls prodigious organizational skills (imagine juggling all those schedules) the film feels chopped together in a near-panic. Dialogue is dubbed into non-moving mouths actors fumble with their props and nobody remembered to make Manhattan look even slightly wintry (Kutcher saunters through Times Square in flannel pajamas). ""New Years Eve"" is a perfect example of why the adjective ""Hollywood"" is so often used as a pejorative. PLOT A couple dozen New Yorkers criss and cross on the last day of the year. RATING PG-13 (mild language adult themes) VideoTrailer New Years Eve CAST Hilary Swank Ashton Kutcher Sarah Jessica Parker Zac Efron Michelle Pfeiffer advertisement | advertise on newsday LENGTH 157 PLAYING AT Area theaters BOTTOM LINE A charmless soulless cash-in from the people who sold you ""Valentines Day"" VideoNew Years Eve stars Back story Stars were out but not together Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff The logistical nightmare of scheduling and filming so many stars was ""an enormous challenge"" says ""New Years Eve"" director Garry Marshall. ""So whoever showed up we shot and we followed their stories."" Many in the huge ensemble cast didnt even meet for the first time until a recent media day to promote the movie because they werent in the same scenes. The filmmakers also opted to shoot the famous ball drop and crowds in Times Square on Dec. 31 2010 making it the first feature film to capture the 106-year-old New Years event live. ""The biggest thing I helped to do was hug [the actors] not because I was so attractive but because they were all freezing"" Marshall recalled. Michelle Pfeiffer plays against type as Ingrid a timid mousy assistant who throws caution to the wind when she makes a deal with Zac Efrons bike-messenger character to help her get a fast start on some long-delayed resolutions. advertisement | advertise on newsday ""Riding [Zacs] motorcycle was a challenge but the elements were the biggest"" said Pfeiffer. ""The weather was one and the paparazzi were out in full force . . . and Gary was constantly talking Zac and I off a ledge."" -- Reuters Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

Pictures From New Years Eve - An Excuse To Meet An Excuse To Meet Credit Warner Bros. Pictures From New Years Eve - Baby Countdown Baby Countdown Credit Warner Bros. Pictures Theres an old folk tale called ""Stone Soup"" in which a group of hungry wanderers hoodwinks a town into coming together to create a delicious stew from nothing but a pot of stones. Its generally considered a story about cooperation in problem-solving but its more cynical lesson is ""If you methodically distract them with enough razzmatazz sometimes people dont notice youre serving soup made of rocks."" At its heart Garry Marshalls New Years Eve is soup made of rocks. Similar in structure to its predecessor Valentines Day the film follows eight () stories all as underdeveloped as you would expect from a film trying to tell eight stories in two hours and also cram in a Ryan Seacrest cameo a couple of bad musical numbers and the most unflattering dress Katherine Heigl has ever worn. (Yes that includes the 27 bridesmaids dresses she wore in the movie where she wore 27 bridesmaids dresses.) And what are the eight stories? Katherine Heigl and Jon Bon Jovi fight. Jessica Biel and Seth Meyers have a baby. Zac Efron takes pity on a mousy Michelle Pfeiffer. Josh Duhamel wears a tux and rides in an RV. Sarah Jessica Parker singly mothers Abigail Breslin. Hilary Swank drops the big shiny ball in Times Square. Ashton Kutcher and Lea Michele get trapped in an elevator. Robert De Niro faces his mortality with the assistance of his pretty nurse Halle Berry. When it comes to making any of these tales interesting the film is 0-for-8. Of the couples the only one that even arguably has any chemistry is Biel and Meyers and thats more comedic chemistry than romantic chemistry. Not one of the single people is at all compelling -- not even De Niro whose entire character description seems to be ""Croaks slowly. Like for hours."" The only entertaining way to watch New Years Eve is as a cruel experiment in which performers stranded with absolutely no script support are forced to subsist on pure presence which quickly becomes a blood sport in which only a few survive. i Glees Lea Michele makes her feature film debut as a backup singer for a rock star (Jon Bon Jovi) hoping to mend fences with his ex. Andrew Schwartz/Warner Bros. Pictures hide caption toggle caption Andrew Schwartz/Warner Bros. Pictures Glees Lea Michele makes her feature film debut as a backup singer for a rock star (Jon Bon Jovi) hoping to mend fences with his ex. Andrew Schwartz/Warner Bros. Pictures Kutcher for instance is playing an undefined slob whos inexplicably attracted to the true-to-type uptight striver played by Lea Michele. But he does it with just enough charm and confidence that he becomes a beacon in the unending darkness that is most of the rest of this movie. His smile is more effective than whole storylines. Hes not doing much actual acting but that ability to put shock paddles to the chest of a dead scene with his face is why he gets work. Seth Meyers for his part can deliver a punch line about as well as anyone currently working so jokes that arent really funny at all become funny because he puts them on his back and carries them. Similarly Halle Berry is handed a scene towards the end that could almost be an acting exercise You know nothing about this character except this demographic sketch theres been no setup and youre playing opposite a computer monitor. Go And Berry lends it a dignity of which it is utterly unworthy. Shes great to watch even when shes not doing anything -- and this movie is how you know that because in this movie she is not doing anything perhaps more than shes ever not done anything before. Others are not even so minimally fortunate. Heigls fired-up style has worked in a romantic comedy or two but Bon Jovis painfully mellow demeanor is the worst possible match for her. She specializes in half-hostile banter but he gives nothing back which makes it seem like shes just yelling at him all the time. Pfeiffer is playing a woman whose sadness is conveyed primarily by her terribly styled brown hair who has the naivete of Rain Man and the nervous energy of a coffee-gulping hamster. Its not clear whether Efrons affable doofus actually likes her merely pities her or just has a thing for being blinked at a lot. Josh Duhamel is pretty but here his character really might as well be named Tux Mannequin. Sarah Jessica Parker is playing an older duller Carrie Bradshaw without the sex or the friends. Hilary Swank won two Oscars and here shes adrift in yet another story about how career womens lives are passing them by. Various side players go to waste as well Sofia Vergara playing the one-dimensional sex bomb people often wrongly assume shes playing on Modern Family; Hector Elizondo reduced to slapstick; Cherry Jones gamely leaking tears in a tiny part that doesnt deserve her. Theres absolutely nothing wrong with silly romantic fare or with interlocking featherweight vignettes -- in fact even Valentines Day worked this formula more successfully than this follow-on does. But the individual pieces have to be made with at least a little love. Its not enough to just gather faces for the poster get Lea Michele to sing with the moaning earnestness she brings to Glee put Sarah Jessica Parker in princess shoes throw some glitter play some Pink and call it a day. Because what these folks have here no matter how much theyve dumped into it is not satisfying. What they have here is soup made of rocks.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Theres a little someone for everyone in ""New Years Eve."" Or so seems the casting principle guiding director Garry Marshall and writer Katherine Fugates latest which follows a number of New Yorkers as they face or dodge the demands of yet another high-pressure holiday. The duo was responsible for last years ""Valentines Day"" which was powerfully mediocre but did well enough at the box office to encourage this second foray into the land of overwrought holidays. The only thing that can inspire more cynicism than a holidays coerced emotions may be a film that both exploits and celebrates said emotions. The film stars among others and in no particular order Sarah Jessica Parker Josh Duhamel Ashton Kutcher Jessica Biel Katherine Heigl Zac Efron as well as prime-time quasars Lea Michele (""Glee"") and Sofia Vergara (""Modern Family""). The latter play close to their small-screen characters. Vergara portrays a saucy sous chef to Heigls caterer Laura who must deal with her ex a rock star named Jensen (Jon Bon Jovi) on the biggest night of her career. Michele is Elise an aspiring backup singer for the headlining rocker. Her big moment gets short-circuited when an elevator grinds to a halt leaving Elise with New Years hater Randy (Kutcher). The cast list goes on and on pockmarked with the registered trademark of the Academy Award thanks to Halle Berry Hilary Swank Robert De Niro Abigail Breslin and Michelle Pfeiffer. Thats a whole lotta talent without ever delivering overall quality. More trifle than truffle ""New Years Eve"" is meant to be a bonbon with a nougat of wisdom at its core insights about what really matters. If you have any doubts about this ambition theres Swanks character Claire to clarify matters. When the famous ball of lights grinds to a halt hours before Ryan Seacrest counts down the newly appointed vice president of the Times Square Alliance takes a moment for televised reflection. There are births of course Biel and Seth Meyers play an expectant couple engaged in a nutty competition. There is the specter of death De Niro portrays a solitary soul forgoing treatment in a hospital where Berry gives nursing an even better name. There are new loves and possibly renewed loves. There is a rendition of ""Auld Lang Syne"" courtesy of Michele and ""Glee"" music producer Adam Anders. ""New Years Eve"" is mildly better than its 2010 sibling though this assessment feels purely a function of liking this group of amiable performers more. Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges has a low-key appeal as a police captain and friend of Swanks character. A little beefier and wearing chin scruff Efron pleases as a cocky bike messenger who takes Pfeiffers wilting secretary on as a project. With all but two twists ""New Years Eve"" is perfectly predictable. When it finally tugs at the heart in a resonant way it cant stick with the mood but cuts to shtick. Maybe thats the point in this season of reflection. Dont ponder too hard. Let there be lite.

"New Years Eve -- far from toast-worthy |       NJ.com comments New Years Eve -- far from toast-worthy Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on December 09 2011 at 805 AM View/Post Comments Should auld acquaintance be forgot? I dont know but ""New Years Eve"" sure should be. A shameless follow-up to Garry Marshalls similarly slapped-together ""Valentines Day"" its another landlocked ""Love Boat"" of a movie with a dozen or so stars traipsing across a city looking for romance. This time New York replaces Los Angeles; the Times Square end-of-year blowout substitutes for the cupid-and-chocolate festival. The corny plotting though remains in place. The dialogue is worse than ever. Clearly the busiest writer on this project was whoever was signing the checks. And the people grabbing them? The usual list of suspects Im afraid including Halle Berry Robert De Niro Michelle Pfeiffer and Hilary Swank. Three Oscar winners and a nominee and all apparently able to deliver any line of dialogue except ""No."" Whats the story? Oh whats the point? De Niro is an old man dying in a hospital; Berry is his nurse. Swank is the neurotic executive in charge of the big ball drop; Pfeiffer reliving the first part of her Catwoman role is a drab drudge of a secretary. Oh and did I forget Sarah Jessica Parker as a nervous mother Katherine Heigl as a love-lorn chef Zac Efron as a bike messenger Ashton Kutcher as a cranky cartoonist and Jon Bon Jovi as a rock star? No I didnt. But Im trying to. Berry actually manages a few real moments in the midst of all this nonsense. Some of the New York locations are pretty. But Marshall (and screenwriter Katherine Fugate who also wrote ""Valentines Day"") seem to be tone deaf to what real life and real people sound like. Andrew SchwartzZac Efron and Michelle Pfeiffer star in the romantic comedy ""New Years Eve."" I suppose its almost sweet that theyd think a group of Manhattan high schoolers would be worried about how to kiss. Almost. But theres nothing inherently hysterical about ""foreign"" accents. Or made-up words for ""vagina."" And yes Garry youre a very good brother but -- Im sorry -- nobody is really longing to see your sister Penny again. The movie ends in the usual welter of reconnections realizations and ""surprises"" -- none of which are surprising at all. Theres also a cameo by the dynamic Mayor Michael Bloomberg and a couple of songs. And a few unintentional laughs and many new career lows. ""Ive made so many mistakes"" a wincing De Niro admits at one point. Yes sir. Yes you have. And Ive reviewed all of them. Ratings note The film contains some strong language and sexual innuendo. New Years Eve (PG-13) Warner Bros (117 min.) Directed by Garry Marshall. With Hilary Swank Ashton Kutcher Michelle Pfeiffer Halle Berry Robert De Niro Jon Bon Jovi. Now playing in New Jersey.

Dave McGinn The Globe and Mail Published Friday Dec. 09 2011 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 239PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English New Years Eve. Its big and shiny and crowded and no matter how much you might look forward to it it never lives up to the hype. The movie is even worse. After director Garry Marshall and writer Katherine Fugates box-office success with Valentines Day a sequel of sorts was inevitable. Here they follow the same formula packing as many celebrities as you can into multiple storylines and hope that all those pretty faces and gushy sentiments will distract you from realizing youre watching a terrible movie. This New Years Eve leaves you feeling like youve got no one to kiss at midnight. Lets count down the reasons why. Movies New Years Eve The official trailer 10. Voiceover narration almost always a sure sign a filmmaker cant establish themes through actual storytelling informs audiences at the movies beginning that ""Some people say theres no beauty left in the world."" If its referring to Ashton Kutchers cheekbones maybe its correct. If it means this movie its so so wrong. 9. Canadian comic Russell Peters has a small part as a caterers assistant who speaks with an Indian accent on a par with Mickey Rooneys Japanese accent in Breakfast at Tiffanys. Russell youre a multimillionaire. Are you really this desperate for movie roles? 8. There are this many storylines. Jessica Biel and Seth Meyers are having a baby; Sarah Jessica Parker is tracking down her daughter (Abigail Breslin); Josh Duhamel is trying to get to Manhattan to meet an old flame; Zac Efron is carting a homely Michelle Pfeiffer around to help her cross off her resolutions in exchange for party tickets; Hilary Swank is working on getting the ball to drop at Times Square; Halle Barry is a nurse tending to a cancer-stricken Robert De Niro; Ashton Kutcher is trapped in an elevator with Lea Michele who needs to get to Times Square to perform as a backup singer; and Jon Bon Jovi plays a famous musician trying to rekindle his romance with a caterer played by Katherine Heigl. All of these characters have back stories that make them compelling flesh and blood people. Kidding 7. When his wifes water breaks Meyerss character hails a cab but turns his back briefly so a stranger jumps in it and takes off. Never seen that one before Then the movie cuts to Meyers and Biel in a rickshaw. As sight gags go its weak. Also no woman in labour would get in a rickshaw. Just saying. 6. When the Times Square ball gets stuck because of mechanical difficulties Swanks character who is in charge of the whole operation saves the day with a televised speech. ""Thats what New Years is all about getting a second chance"" she says. Ohhhhh I get it. Shes really talking about all the other characters in the movie. 5. The complete absence of chemistry among the various stars. Youd think if you packed this many gorgeous people in to one movie some of them would generate a spark. You would be wrong. 4. The character Pipers mom. A recurring gag thats funny at first but gets overused in a movie grasping to find laughs anywhere it can. 3. Ashton Kutcher plays a mopey sad-sack who refuses to go out on New Years Eve because a girl broke his heart in college. Seriously? 2. Watching three Oscar winners in this case Robert De Niro Halle Barry and Hilary Swank reduced to this brand of schmaltz. 1. The depressing certainty that regardless of how awful it is the movie will do well at the box office thus ensuring more wretched follow ups. Veterans Day? Columbus Day? New Years only comes once a year but lets hope that cinematically it never happens again.

Apparently no one told Hilary Swanks character in the flaccid new ensemble comedy ""New Years Eve"" -- she delivers a speech about how important and life-changing the closing of the year can be and even though her monologue was so cliche-ridden that I found myself tuning out midway through other characters spent the rest of the movie telling her how deep it was. But then all the other characters in this movie are morons. Todays pop culture landscape hasnt exactly been crying out for a revival of ""Love American Style"" the corny Nixon-era anthology sitcom featuring short and sappy vignettes about the wackiness of romance. But Garry Marshall once a contributor to that dopey TV show seems hell-bent on reviving its brainless brand of hearts and flowers with this idiotic time-waster thats determined to put the same stink on New Years Eve that Marshalls recent ""Valentines Day"" inflicted on Feb. 14. Put together these movies represent the most expensive and arguably worst-written ""Love Boat"" sweeps month ever created. The annual Times Square ball-drop becomes a backdrop for eight or so inane little tales about insipid New Yorkers searching for love and connections on the last page of the calendar. All-star New Years Eves havent been this disastrous since the S.S. Poseidon capsized and by the end of ""New Years Eve"" youll be wishing for some colossal natural disaster to befall these clods. None of the marquee names come off particularly well here so its more a matter of figuring out who embarrasses themselves the most. My vote goes to Michelle Pfeiffer playing an emotionally-strangled secretary who quits her job and attempts to accomplish all of her new years resolutions in one day with the help of a bike courier played by Zac Efron. As unconvincing as Efron is as a rakish bro-about-town Pfeiffers portrayal of a bottled-up woman of a certain age borders on the offensive. Her twitchy frumpy idea of what middle-aged unfulfillment looks like feels a lazy and cynical performance from an actress who should know better. Also doing herself no favors is Sofia Vergara a delightful member of the ""Modern Family"" ensemble on the small screen but whose work here follows her dispiriting film appearances in ""The Smurfs"" and ""Happy Feet Two."" Vergaras !Ay routine transcends stereotypes in her TV work but without a really talented writing staff feeding her lines she comes off like a charmless Charo. Theres no surprise in seeing the likes of Josh Duhamel and Jessica Biel (both holdovers from ""Valentines Day"") -- much less Katherine Heigl Jon Bon Jovi Ashton Kutcher and Lea Michele -- being less than picky about their movie roles but what the heck are Robert De Niro Halle Berry Cherry Jones Sarah Paulson and Abigail Breslin doing phoning it in for this hack-stravaganza? By the time the clock rings midnight in ""New Years Day"" youll find yourself grateful for the likes of Larry Miller and Yeardley Smith in minor roles playing the closest thing this movie has to recognizable human beings. And if you enjoyed the fact that recent films like ""Tower Heist"" and ""In Time"" seemed perfectly timed to match the Occupy Wall Street zeitgeist ""New Years Eve"" gets that sort of thing all wrong opening with someone saying ""We want to see a show of strength from the NYPD"" (they probably said that before the sweep of Zuccotti Park) and later featuring a third-act cameo from the newly-hissable Mayor Bloomberg. ""New Years Day"" has all the edge of Guy Lombardo and the laughs of a hangover. Do yourself a favor and RSVP ""No"" to this party. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Starring Robert De Niro Ashton Kutcher Michelle Pfeiffer Hilary Swank Director Garry Marshall Release Opened Dec 9 2011  Editorial Review Not worth staying up forBy Ann HornadayFriday Dec. 9 2011""New Years Eve"" exists as a particularly soulless example of a movie thats less made than machined assembled according to an algorithmic formula known only to the widget-twisters and bottom-line-feeders at Warner Brothers whose sole purpose in life is to separate trusting filmgoers from their money without providing commensurate value. Promising an easily masticated story shiny surface polish and more stars than the last Jerry Lewis telethon ""New Years Eve"" wouldnt have to be great art to succeed. It would merely need to glitter gleam grab a few heartstrings and gratify perhaps the most primal sensory demand of film audiences which is to watch genetically gifted men and women behave in ways that seem both super-human and relatable simultaneously. ""New Years Eve"" fails to clear even that modest bar which will come as no surprise to anyone who suffered from its conceptual forebear ""Valentines Day."" Another cobbled-together mash-up of actorly duets this leaden effort from screenwriter Katherine Fugate and director Garry Marshall sags when it should shimmer labors clunkily when it should glide and - most unforgivably - plops some otherwise attractive and even talented actors into roles that are completely outside their physical and psychic comfort zone. So were subjected to the ignominious tableau of Robert De Niro - Robert De Freaking Niro - lying helplessly in a hospital bed while a nurse played by Halle Berry strokes his hand presumably out of mutual concern for their once Oscar-winning careers. Hilary Swank - all teeth and hair - brays unconvincingly through a performance as a young woman in charge of the ball-drop in Times Square sharing inscrutable confidences with a Manhattan cop played by the rapper Ludacris whose line readings suggest he was given horse tranquilizers before every take. Michelle Pfeiffer in a drab wig and red-rimmed eye makeup pouts on a motorcycle behind Zac Efron whose phenomenal physical charms Marshall keeps hidden until the blooper reel in the final credits. Katherine Heigl Jon Bon Jovi Sarah Jessica Parker Lea Michele Sofia Vergara and Seth Meyers are here too as well as ""Valentines Day"" vets Jessica Biel and Ashton Kutcher the latter of whom spends the entire movie in his pajamas an apt sartorial metaphor for a production mired in lazy writing lackadaisical pacing and a sense of entitlement that conjures visions of torches pitchforks and an Occupy Hollywood tent city in Burbank. Most insulting of all the filmmakers insist on inserting bits of moralizing in the movie like so many razor blades in a candy apple so that midnight in ""New Years Eve"" cant just be about romance and giddy anticipation it has to be about ""forgiveness"" ""second chances"" - oh and ""Sherlock Holmes A Game of Shadows"" another fine Warner Bros. product opening soon in a theater near you and prominently cross-promoted in the movies Times Square sequences. Clocking in at an unforgivable two hours ""New Years Eve"" perpetrates the same forced jollity oversize proportions and crass superficiality as the very holiday it so wanly exploits. Its a movie pretending to party but secretly pining for its own pillow (just after the paycheck). Behind all the noisemakers and funny glasses ""New Years Eve"" - and everyone in it - is dead behind the eyes.Contains profanity including some sexual references.

If I say I dont much care for New Years Eve I risk sounding like a curmudgeon. But I have zero reservations about telling you how much I loathed ""New Years Eve"" a soul-sucking monument to Hollywood greed and saccharine holiday culture. Director Garry Marshalls star-stuffed follow-up to ""Valentines Day"" begins with an unrecognizably dowdy Michelle Pfeiffer being knocked face-first into some garbage bags and goes downhill from there. Its New Years Eve in the drabbest-looking Big Apple ever populated by the least witty and insightful human beings ever. Here is what passes for a high-comedy insult ""Youre a really charming guy. Where do you work the DMV?"" Seth Meyers for shame. In one of the films supposed ""slice of life"" storylines the ""SNL"" newscaster and Jessica Biel sporting an oddly squishy baby bump are a couple hoping to win cash for the first child born in the new year. PHOTOS NEW YEARS EVE FILMING IN NEW YORK Meanwhile Hilary Swank frets as head of the Times Square Ball Drop Committee (or something like that); the ball is stuck on its ascent. Her press conference -- slow news day? -- is broadcast to the gathering mob in the square which falls silent as mobs are wont to do. Pfeiffer a high-strung secretary quits her job and hires bike messenger Zac Efron bro-ing it up alarmingly to help her realize everything on her lifes to-do list. In one day for some reason. Rich boy Josh Duhamel broken down upstate desperately searches for a way back. Hes got a date with a mysterious lady from last New Years Eve as well as a speaking gig at an event catered by chef Katherine Heigl whose ex (Jon Bon Jovi well-preserved) turns out to be the evenings musical guest. Will their passion reignite? Does Hector Elizondo always show up in a Marshall film? Robert De Niro makes an unintentionally hilarious appearance as a cancer-stricken former Vietnam photojournalist whos not long for this world. ""Remember to follow your heart"" he croaks at Halle Berry the most beautiful nurse in the history of nurses. There is one small moment courtesy of Berry that feels emotionally honest. Its probably not even as good as Im remembering but comparatively its Olivier doing Shakespeare. Sarah Jessica Parker as mom to Abigail Breslins restless teen is just plain miscast both her brother and her suitor (last act reveals) seem far too young. Finally there are neighbors Ashton Kutcher and Lea Michele stuck in their loft buildings elevator. This vignette feels like a microcosm of the myth of spending New Years in Times Square. Penned into a small space for eight hours this duo whiles away the time swapping life stories falling in love and bursting into song. In real life time drags claustrophobia sets in and theres nowhere to pee.

The obvious thing to do when you have found a very easy way to make a lot of money without putting forth any effort is to do it again. Marshall and Fugate have therefore re-teamed for New Years Eve which is not a sequel (it has none of the same characters) but is instead an even lazier even dumber re-hash of Valentines Day -- a movie that was already very lazy and dumb to begin with The setting has shifted from L.A. to New York and its December 31 instead of February 14 but the premise is the same numerous photogenic people have romantic adventures over the course of the day and night and a few dozen A- and B-list actors get to do no more than a few days work and be in a high-profile movie. Some of the romantic adventures intersect and some dont. Whats consistent is that not one of the characters ever behaves in a normal human manner nor is even one of the stories compelling funny or interesting. You talk about a script feeling like a first draft; this one feels like the rough outline that you scribble on a napkin before you even start on the first draft. Claire (Hilary Swank) is stressed out because shes the vice president of the Times Square Alliance and is in charge of the ball-dropping thing and if that goes wrong all of New York City will be plunged into darkness and despair. She has her staff practice throwing confetti out the windows to make sure it ... works? I guess? For extra dumbness shes afraid of heights. Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges who clearly was never as bored in his life as he was during the one day he had to spend working on this movie plays a police officer who is her friend and serves no function in the story. Its another cop who slings Claire over his shoulder to carry her upstairs because shes afraid of heights as I mentioned. Meanwhile theres a hipster douche named Ashton Kutcher and he plays a hipster douche named Randy who is a real Ebenezer Scrooge when it comes to New Years Eve for reasons the movie does not bother to pretend to be interested in coming up with. He gets stuck in his apartment buildings elevator with Elise (Lea Michele) and they are trapped for what the movie tells us is more than eight hours. How unlucky for them that nobody else in the building tried to summon the elevator all day long At the end of this ordeal they fall in (SPOILER ALERT) love. Meanwhile a mousy and timid secretary named Ingrid (Michelle Pfeiffer) has squandered the entire year without tackling her list of resolutions so she does the only logical thing she hires the bicycle messenger who delivers packages to her office to help her accomplish everything before midnight. The courier Paul (Zac Efron) is Randys friend which you can tell because they both say ""bro"" a lot. Ingrid is painfully awkward possibly autistic and her resolutions are mostly things that cannot be accomplished in one day like ""travel around the world."" So Paul has to cheat a little to help her achieve them and I dont know why she needed him anyway but I resolved I would give the movie a positive review if these two characters had sex but they didnt. Meanwhile there are other people with equally implausible and idiotic New Years Eve complications. Jessica Biel and Sarah Paulson are pregnant ladies hoping to win a prize by giving birth to the first baby of the new year with Seth Meyers and Til Schweiger as their husbands. They get very competitive about this Robert De Niro is an old man dying of cancer in a hospital where the nurse is Halle Berry. Katherine Heigl is a caterer at a fancy party where legendary rock star Jensen (played by Jon Bon Jovi) is performing and this guy is her ex-boyfriend and they clash. In other words its Katherine Heigl doing a medley of her greatest hits Sofia Vergera works with Heigl and has giant bazooms and speaks in that comical South American accent of hers for comedy. Sarah Jessica Parker is a mom with a 15-year-old daughter (Abigail Breslin) who wants to spend New Years Eve in Times Square with her pals. Josh Duhamel was at a wedding in Connecticut and is now hurrying back to the city and must hitch a ride in an RV driven by a vacationing family. He needs to get there in time so he can reconnect with the mystery woman he met last New Years Eve who is probably one of the other women we have already met but its a mystery Also Carla Gugino James Belushi Hector Elizondo Cary Elwes Cherry Jones and Matthew Broderick (playing a character named ""Buellerton"" heaven help us) have small roles. IMDb says Alyssa Milano was there too but I dont remember seeing her. Heres the films sense of humor boiled down to one line ""Youre a real hostile guy. Where do you work the DMV??"" (Boy the DMV am I right??) And here it is boiled down to another line ""There are so many things we cant control in this world earthquakes floods reality shows."" (Golly those reality shows sure are out of hand arent they?) If you find those jokes funny this is definitely the movie for you. If you dont then you will probably feel the same way I did which is that I kept hoping a monster would rise from the sea and devour everyone.

Starring Hilary Swank Sarah Jessica Parker Katherine Heigl Jon Bon Jovi Josh Duhamel Robert De Niro Halle Berry Michelle Pfeiffer and Ashton Kutcher. Directed by Garry Marshall. (PG-13. 118 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) What can be said about a movie that is nice and awful? That has a warm spirit and is 100 percent phony? That has all the stars in the galaxy and all the appeal of rotting fish? Garry Marshalls ""New Years Eve"" takes one of the calendars most interesting holidays - the most extreme and irrational the one that acknowledges death the one that reacts to fear - and renders it innocuous and dull. Related Stories Review Skip this New Years Eve Review New Years Eve New Years Eve rings hollow The casting is the least of this movies problems but the most bizarre. Michelle Pfeiffer plays a lonely old biddy - what are they trying to do to her? - and Sarah Jessica Parker (born 1965) and Zac Efron (born 1987) are brother and sister. (Oh their poor mother.) Josh Duhamel who looks as if hes 30 goes through the movie talking about a planned midnight rendezvous with the woman of his dreams. Then the woman shows up looking not quite old enough to be his mother but like a half sister from a previous marriage. Its as if the roles were handed out by lottery. Marshall is known as one of the nicest guys in the business. (I met him once and believe that to be true.) But a problem of ""New Years Eve"" is that all the characters are as nice as he is - even nicer because in person Marshall has a sharp wit whereas the characters here are like innocent children. To the extent that they have any willfulness at all its a childs willfulness. Thus Katherine Heigl as a woman angry at having been jilted by her rock star lover (Jon Bon Jovi) reacts by throwing eggs at his poster. The plot is built flimsily around several interlinked stories. Hilary Swank is the woman in charge of the Times Square festivities but oh no there is an electrical short in the Times Square ball. So she goes before the assembled New York press to explain the situation and launches into a speech about forgiveness and new beginnings as the sound track swells. Those New York reporters must be a bunch of pushovers because they fall for this and dont ask a single question. Parker plays the mother of a 15-year-old girl (Abigail Breslin who has become all-too convincing at playing absolute brats). The girl sneaks out of the house to go to Times Square while poor lonely Pfeiffer gets a guided tour around New York from spunky Efron. Meanwhile in a nod to the cycles of life and death two couples (Til Schweiger and Sarah Paulson and Seth Meyers and Jessica Biel) compete to have the first baby of 2012 while nurse Halle Berry sits vigil over the bed of a sick man (Robert De Niro) who might not make it through the night. Come to think of it hes pretty loquacious for a guy with 10 toes 10 fingers and nine fingernails in the grave. The jokes are corny and not funny. There really may not be a single laugh in the picture. The moments of tender feeling have no feeling at all. Even Ashton Kutcher looks uncomfortable as though the whole thing were beneath his dignity - even his dignity. Lea Michele sings ""Auld Lang Syne"" - thats good. Thats about 90 good seconds. Its clear what the attempt here was to capture the mystery of time and the romance of New York on a magical night when the streets are alive etc. But thats not what we get. Too bad. Wouldnt you love to see a 1911 movie about the turn of the year 1912 to get an idea of how people saw themselves and their world? Alas one hundred years from now anyone watching ""New Years Eve"" to see what we were like wont have a clue. E-mail Mick LaSalle at mlasallesfchronicle.com.

Garry Marshalls previous all-star theme movie ""Valentines Day"" didnt exactly become a holiday perennial. Undaunted hes back with ""New Years Eve.""The cast at least on paper is formidable if ill-used. Robert De Niro plays a tubed-up cancer patient Halle Berry plays his nurse Michelle Pfeiffer is a lovelorn mousy office worker. Also turning up are Jessica Biel Katherine Heigl Ashton Kutcher Seth Meyers Sarah Jessica Parker Abigail Breslin Jon Bon Jovi Hilary Swank and many others.Katherine Fugate who also wrote ""Valentines Day"" sets a score of interlocking scenarios in motion all of them shopworn. The film is like one of those Robert Altman big-canvas movies minus the inspiration. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? It does have my favorite blatant product plug though.

PicturesAshton Kutcher and Lea Michele see a new side of each other after getting stuck in an elevator together in New Years Eve.Sponsored LinksWhere Valentines Day was set in Los Angeles New Years Eve takes place in New York but it has the same wafer-thin premise A collection of people preparing for the holiday find love in the right or wrong places.Love rekindled fresh starts and redemption are the themes but that makes the screenplay sound far more substantial than it is. Emotions are expressed with greeting card shallowness and by a panoply of stars each with about a paragraphs worth of actual story.Theres the mousy middle-aged woman (an unattractively photographed Michelle Pfeiffer) who impulsively quits her boring desk job. Shes hellbent on fulfilling resolutions amassed over the years -- like traveling around the world and seeing Bali -- all in a day. She engages the services of a bike messenger (Zac Efron) who cuts corners but offers more excitement than she apparently has ever known. (He takes her to a spa named Bali and the world travel is done by hopping around a giant map in a museum.) Charmed yet?Other vignettes are just as lame-brained. A slacker/New Years Eve hater (Ashton Kutcher) and his perky neighbor (Glees Lea Michele) get stuck in an elevator. Initially they cant stand each other then after she sings a song in the confined space sparks ignite.About the movieNew Years Eve  out of fourStars Halle Berry Ashton Kutcher Michelle Pfeiffer Jon Bon Jovi Robert De Niro Hilary Swank Josh Duhamel Director Garry MarshallDistributor Warner Bros.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint How can a film titled ""New Years Eve"" be so unfathomably dated? The movie plays like a time warp to 1951. The opening shot of the movie is a horse and buggy. Jon Bon Jovi plays pop musics hottest superstar. You half expect the actors to pass a kissing booth or an organ grinder with a leashed monkey. Like director Garry Marshalls depressingly mirthless ""Valentines Day"" the new film is one of those ""more celebrities than youd see in rehab"" ensembles following a dozen characters over the holiday. The script (a cluster of Post-its actually by ""VD"" writer Katherine Fugate) is to comedy what a salt flat is to landscape. Artificial obvious and insulting to thinking audiences it combines a tourists view of New York City with rom-com platitudes and forced sentiment. The story is a monument to contrivance unworthy of star Sarah Jessica Parker. And thats saying something. With so many players competing for a few minutes of screen time theres no opportunity to flesh out any of the characters. The far-from-all-star cast is a see-whos-available hodgepodge (Lea Michele meet Robert De Niro) that adds up to less than the sum of its parts. If youve been dying to see Ludacris play a cop Katherine Heigl as a caterer or Ryan Seacrest playing Ryan Seacrest your prayers have been answered. Their long-sought breakout roles have arrived. Even capable actors suffer here. Michelle Pfeiffer is cast awkwardly against type as a mousy woman ticking off a list of adventurous resolutions and De Niro wallows in bathos as a terminally ill man hoping to see the Times Square New Years Eve ball drop one final time. Some story lines intersect in a shallow way; most just toss the ball from player to player until the clock runs down. A few characters connect with one another but none of them connect with the audience. Since I am personally old it is OK for me to say this. Marshall pushing 80 has no business making films about contemporary life. He has no clue what it is like. The movie is set in a delusional neverland New York City where practically everyone is well-off and white (excepting a few exotic stereotypes with zany accents). All anyone needs to make life complete is the right man/woman to kiss at midnight and the biggest urban problem is the possible malfunctioning of the lighted New Years ball. It would be an act of dignity for Marshall to get out of the movie game and enjoy his golden years at the shuffleboard league or playing ""gotcher nose"" with infants. When your comedic skills are so drained that your movies end-credits blooper reel is padded with clumsy staged shtick its time to move on. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Slideshow New Years Eve Premiere Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about New Years Eve >> New Years Eve is the film that asks ""You want fries with that?"" Its a busy breezy comedy about a broad cross-section of New Yorkers who have in common only breathtaking good looks. And some connection however tenuous to the ball dropping in New Yorks Times Square to usher in 2012. Lets face it. Any discussion of New Years Eve begins and ends with the cast - the surreal Hollywood-agents-Christmas-card-list cast Katherine Heigl Ashton Kutcher Halle Berry Josh Duhamel Hilary Swank Jon Bon Jovi Jessica Biel Zac Efron Sarah Jessica Parker . . . there simply isnt enough room to list them all. Even the cameo characters with as many lines as a Snapple cap go to profile players like Matthew Broderick Cary Elwes Alyssa Milano Jim Belushi and Common. This is more of a clown car than it is a movie. Would it surprise you to learn New Years Eve is the handiwork of the same people who brought you Valentines Day? Same formula different holiday. Director Garry Marshall even manages to squeeze in camera time for his sister Penny and his longtime good-luck charm Hector Elizondo. Unfortunately he also wedged in the creepy tandem of New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Ryan Seacrest to do the big countdown to midnight. It would be inaccurate to say there are plots in New Years Eve. There are a number of setups and these get shuffled through faster than a card dealer in Atlantic City. The cast probably didnt even get trailers they were on the set for so short a time. And they didnt get catered meals just a bag of peanuts. If there is a central story line it belongs to Michelle Pfeiffer unrecognizable as a mousy secretary. Efron steals the film (petty theft at best) as the bicycle messenger Puck who makes Pfeiffers bucket list come true before the clock strikes 12. Robert De Niro is also here as a final-stage cancer patient. But apart from not having shaved in a few days he looks strikingly hearty. What happened to the committed method actor who put on 60 pounds for Raging Bull? New Years Eve is too effervescent to be truly disappointing but its certainly not intoxicating either. The script starts out sparkly enough but after the first half hour it slumps into triteness. The comedy gets flat; the romance gets stale and the melodrama gets predictable. The party is over in this film long before the ball drops on this New Years Eve. Contact staff writer David Hiltbrand at 215-854-4552 dhiltbrandphillynews.com or daveondemand_tv on Twitter.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Director Garry Marshall follows last years Valentines Day romcom crapfest with an even more puke-up-able sample of the species. This time its New Years Eve when an all-star cast lines up to collect paychecks - at our expense Choke on it greedy actors As Ryan Seacrest preps to drop his ball in Time Square on the Big Night with the help of Oscar winner Hilary Swank countless lovers and losers interact. Or they would if screenwriter Katherine Fugate knew how the hell to do that. Instead we get an avalanche of cliches.  Will caterer Katherine Heigl forgive rock star Jon Bon Jovi for dumping her last New Years Eve? And will her sous chef Sofia Vergara stop with the cha cha cha Charo voice already? Will Seth Meyers and Jessica Biel have their baby just in time to collect the hospitals first born in 2012 prize money? Really Seth? Really? Will Lea Michelle get to Times Square on time to sing backup with Jon Bon Jovi? The impediment besides the script is that shes stuck in an elevator with Ashton Kutcher (even Glee would find this far-fetched). Meanwhile Sarah Jessica Parker fights with tween daughter Abigail Breslin and Michelle Pfeiffer looking dowdy (impossible) quits her thankless secretary job to live live live with the help of delivery guy Zac Efron who delivers the films one appealing performance. Worst of all is Robert De Niro as a dying cancer patient nursed by Oscar winner Halle Berry who wants to watch the ball drop one more time before he croaks. Its amazing De Niro doesnt choke on his dialogue. ""Im sorry for the bad things Ive done"" he groans. If De Niro is referring to the lousy movies hes perpetrated in the last decade hes unforgiven. Early in the film Pfeiffer falls into a rancid pile of garbage. I cant think of a better metaphor for the movie which leaves a stink on  everyone associated with it. Whats Marshall up to next? Presidents Day with the stars dressed as Washington and Lincoln heading to a costume party. It cant be worse than New Years Eve which is bad beyond belief.

Pictures Ashton Kutcher in ""New Years Eve"" (Warner Bros. Pictures) Warner Bros. Pictures Sarah Jessica Parker in ""New Years Eve"" (Warner Bros. Pictures) Critics who resolve to be honest wait 12 months for a movie as bad as ""New Years Eve."" Through the post-Oscar doldrums the summer blockbusters and the Halloween horror flicks we patiently explain that theres a spectrum of suckiness and that duds such as ""Green Lantern"" and ""The Dilemma"" are merely warning shots. But then a fiery fiasco like ""New Years Eve"" falls from the sky and filmgoers get a glimpse of the apocalypse.We tried to warn you.Ensemble comedies used to be common until television shows such as ""The Love Boat"" torpedoed the fine art of collective casting. For his holiday huddle ""Valentines Day"" TV veteran Garry Marshall employed seemingly every actor in Los Angeles who could fit into a demographic slot and scrawl an ""X"" on a two-day contract from Ashton Kutcher and Jessica Biel to his ""Pretty Woman"" cohort Hector Elizondo. Those three actors are back in different roles and a different city but the premise is the same old schtick about searching for love on a deadline. Most of the subplots revolve around a New York record company whose superstar Jensen (Jon Bon Jovi) is supposed to perform in Times Square at midnight. Hes aching after a breakup with caterer Laura (Katherine Heigl) and oblivious to the flirtations of fiery Ava (Sofia Vergara). Office frump Ingrid (Michelle Pfeiffer) composes a bucket list for her impending spinsterhood and bike messenger Paul (Zac Efron) tries to make her wishes come true in exchange for a backstage pass. Company heir Sam (Josh Duhamel) is stuck in the snowy suburbs with a disabled car and backup singer Elise (Lea Michele) is stuck on an elevator with disinterested party pooper Randy (Kutcher).On the fringes are a loathsome couple (Biel and Seth Meyers) who hope to win a contest if their baby is born at midnight a still-hot mama (Sarah Jessica Parker) who is worried about her kiss-crazy daughter (Abigail Breslin) a cancer-stricken veteran (Robert De Niro) who wants to watch the ball-drop festivities from the roof of his hospital and the electrician (Elizondo) who fixes the balky ball for the persevering Times Square publicist (Hilary Swank). The sanitized setting and sappy script are so littered with cardboard characters and crass product placements that youll mourn for the muggers and porno theaters that De Niro cursed in ""Taxi Driver."" Quoth his character ""Someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets."" This malignant movie makes you hope that the ancient Mayans were right about the cleansing rain they forecast for next New Years Eve.

(Andrew Schwartz) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday December 8 2011 1200 PM Title New Years Eve Film Info Random New Yorkers connect for a momentous night. With Hilary Swank Robert De Niro Halle Berry. Director Garry Marshall (138). PG-13 language mild sexuality. At area theaters. The first thing we learn from Garry Marshalls latest star-packed extravaganza is ""Some people swear theres no beauty left in the world. No magic."" These people must have seen an early screening of ""New Years Eve"" an inferior retread of Marshalls equally contrived ""Valentines Day"" only dressed up with coats and confetti. The essential asset these movies -- both written by Katherine Fugate -- boast is that they allow us to feel as if weve been invited to the biggest event of the year. But were stuck behind the velvet rope watching a parade of celebrities who exhibit no real connection to ordinary human behavior. Still if youre looking for some holiday escapism this is the place to find it. For 98 minutes beautiful people wander romantically around New York sharing Big Moments and finding fairy-tale endings. At some point most make an appearance at one of two parties. In Brooklyn Laura (Katherine Heigl) and Ava (Sofia Vergara) are catering a year-end bash featuring Lauras ex rock star Jensen (Jon Bon Jovi). Middle-aged Ingrid (Michelle Pfeiffer) has promised twentysomething Paul (Zac Efron) a ticket but first he has to help her achieve all her resolutions. In Manhattan Claire (Hilary Swank) and Brendan (Ludacris) are busy organizing the Times Square ball drop. Fifteen-year-old Hailey (Abigail Breslin) wants her first kiss much to the dismay of her protective mom (Sarah Jessica Parker). New neighbors Randy (Ashton Kutcher) and Elise (Lea Michele) are stuck in an elevator together. At a busy hospital Aimee (Halle Berry) nurses a dying patient (Robert De Niro) while two couples (Sarah Paulson and Til Schweiger Jessica Biel and Seth Meyers) are competing to have the first baby of the year. And I havent even mentioned Josh Duhamel Matthew Broderick Carla Gugino Common Cherry Jones Hector Elizondo Ryan Seacrestor Alyssa Milano. Youd be forgiven for seeing nothing but a bunch of big names in the above paragraphs; thats all Marshall sees too. None of these actors commits to a real character; none is even given the chance. Many are miscast (Pfeiffer) misused (Vergara) and nearly ignored (Milano) while others (Heigl Bon Jovi Meyers) struggle under their spotlights. The whole movie is made of extended cameos strung together with platitudes about second chances leaps of faith and listening to your heart. That these sentiments are delivered as enormous amounts of corporate promotion flash across the screen seems about right for such a soulless project. Even New York gets shortchanged; rarely has a local film been shot so carelessly and with so little feeling for the settings and sites that make the city special. With all this talent at his disposal Marshall could be making worthwhile entertainment something genuinely fun as well as flashy. Instead he drops the ball tossing off a cultural artifact with as much lasting relevance as a plastic tiara. Magic Moment In the most touching scene Berrys late-night date offers a bittersweet surprise.

Actors Everyone RelatedNew Years Eve Drops the Ball Associated PressNew Years Eve Marshall Plan for the Holidays Chicago Tribune Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture After an illustrious career celebrating princesses and prostitutes in film 77 year-old director Garry Marshall has settled into a sort of Happy Days redux phase focused on holiday pictures. First Valentines Day in 2010 and now New Years Eve. This nice old gent seems content with trying to make nice pictures about nice days and nice things like reconciliation serendipity and love. Except the slapdash New Years Eve is neither nicely written nor nicely acted nor nicely made. The setting is New York City on December 31. Over in Times Square nervous Claire (Hilary Swank) prepares for the nights big festivities. Her job is to make sure the legendary ball drops an event which provides the movies greatest dramatic crisis. Laura (Katherine Heigl) a chef getting her big break is cooking for a gala at which her ex-boyfriend Jensen (Jon Bon Jovi) a rock star who ran out on her last New Years Eve will perform. Meanwhile a scruffy pajama and hoodie-clad comic book artist (Ashton Kutcher) with a bad attitude toward the holiday is stuck in an elevator with a girl (Lea Michele) full of cheer. In the fun part of a nearby hospital two couples (Jessica Biel/Seth Meyers and Til Schweiger/Sarah Paulson) are vying for a 25000 prize given to the first new baby of the New Year. On another floor a friendless cancer patient (Robert De Niro gruesomely hammy) awaits death with his saintly nurse Aimee (Halle Berry). He picked this place to croak because the roof offers a perfect view of the Times Square ball drop. Does writer Katherine Fugate (also of Valentines Day) know how to bring it full circle or what? (MORE The Top 10 Worst Christmas Movies) Her full circles do tend to raise some logistical questions though such as why would it take one character from late afternoon to midnight just to ride by subway from Brooklyn to Times Square while two others traverse every borough by scooter with long stops at a spa an animal shelter and Radio City Music Hall? If New Years Eves approach to chronology is suspect its character development is even sketchier. Most parts have been tailored to their specific celebrity. Sarah Jessica Parker plays a costume designer who lives on a brownstone block just like Carrie Bradshaws. (Though this ones in Brooklyn which Carrie would never go for.) Micheles character is like Glees Rachel a singer looking for her big break while Bon Jovi is well Bon Jovi. Sofia Vergara playing Lauras horny sous chef actually makes a joke that begins ""in my couuuuntry"" in keeping with her Modern Family role as the Colombian bombshell. The films use of character and celebrity familiarity as crutches produces a constant state of disappointment. Oh theres Michelle Pfeiffer you think shell bring some class to the joint. She certainly tries and has a moment or two of grace as put-upon secretary Ingrid a blatant nod to her pre-Catwoman persona Selina Kyle in Batman Returns. The difference is no one ever bothers to explain how Ingrid ended up the way she is neutered and declawed. For much of the movie I assumed she was also suffering from a terminal disease partly because shes working through a New Years resolution/bucket list (featuring items like ""be amazed"" and ""save a life"") with the aide of an obnoxious young bike messenger (Zac Efron) but mostly because she looks like such hell. Shes not alone. New Years Eve may be the ugliest movie of the year from the garish lighting to the heavy make up and bad costumes. Lea Micheles lips are as frosted as a cupcake while the bleached and bronzer-ed Heigl is styled like Britney Spears during her darkest days. It isnt just the actresses who suffer either; Bon Jovi and Josh Duhamel both appear molded from plastic and Ludacris playing Boy Friday to Swanks Claire has the washed out hangdog look of a man who hasnt slept in days. It might take me until the real New Years Eve to list every cast member of note in New Years Eve so Ill refrain. The movie is devised as a Whitmans Sampler for the masses something for everyone. The impulse to want to see movies like these come easily -- with all these stars in one place it seems as comforting and appealing as the Oscars do every year. (The similarities dont stop there all those former Oscar winners and nominees awkward editing forced humor and canned dialogue. Plus New Years Eve drags on interminably.) But sometimes its good to stay home. Think of the bonuses miss a bad movie save money and discourage Marshall from starting on Superbowl Sunday or Mothers Day.

"New Years Eve (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review New Years Eve (PG-13) Director Garry Marshalls second holiday-themed ensemble comedy is just as bland as his first one. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald12/7/2011 Editor rating 2 Valentines Day Redux -- or as its officially known New Years Eve -- purports to be about a night on which the ""entire world comes together"" to celebrate. Considering that most people in this country spend that particular night on the sofa with a bag of chips and some cheap bubbly and are fighting to stay awake at midnight the premise may be somewhat overstated. Still the latest in what is turning out to be a series of secondary holiday-themed movies -- can Bastille Day be far behind? -- New Years Eve is not unbearable. Its not bad but its not good either. It delivers exactly what you expect pretty faces shallow romance and a mythical fanaticism about an event in a friendly Manhattan unblemished by hyper-vigilant security measures obnoxious drunks or New York Jets fans. It straddles a strange middle ground that probably bears more scrutiny than we care to give it. If we understood why we could be vaguely entertained by something so slight wed probably never get out of bed in the morning. Does it matter really what happens? OK if it does Lots of stars spar fall in love face regrets and eagerly anticipate the ball drop in Times Square. Names are unimportant in this script; these characters are known by their faces. Bike messenger Zac Efron -- who is far and away the best and most charming person on the screen despite the presence of three Oscar winners -- squires around a sad Michelle Pfeiffer and helps her cross dreams off her bucket list. Ashton Kutcher and Lea Michele get stuck in an elevator (please get her out before she starts belting out Streisand). Josh Duhamel hopes to meet the mysterious woman he met a year ago at midnight. Sarah Jessica Parker worries when her teenage daughter (Abigail Breslin) sneaks off to meet a dreamy boy (Jake T. Austin). Hilary Swank is in charge of ensuring the ball drops on time with an assist from Ludacris. Nurse Halle Berry comforts a dying Robert De Niro. Wait. What the hell is Robert De Niro doing here? Jon Bon Jovi looks fantastic but honestly does he really prefer the shrill Katherine Heigl to the Sofia Vergara in a low-cut tight shirt? Naturally you cant stare too hard at this shiny processed bauble or it begins to crack. Zac Efron is Sarah Jessica Parkers brother? Til Schweiger who played the bloodthirsty Nazi-hating Hugo Stiglitz in Inglourious Basterds is really playing a dad hoping his kid is born at midnight so he wins 25000 for his family? A trendy record label party -- the hottest ticket in town we are told -- features a rock balladeer who performs John Hiatts Have a Little Faith in Me a lovely song especially in its original incarnation but hardly the trendy clubby Pitbull/Flo Rida/Black Eyed Peas performance such a gathering would actually provide? So no dont look too closely. And when New Years Eve pops up on cable next winter youll think hazily that yes this could be cute and youll watch it again. Cast Sarah Jessica Parker Ashton Kutcher Michelle Pfeiffer Zac Efron Josh Duhamel Katherine Heigl Jon Bon Jovi Hilary Swank Robert De Niro Halle Berry Jessica Biel Seth Meyers. Director Garry Marshall. Screenwriter Katherine Fugate. Producers Mike Karz Wayne Allan Rice Jose Rosen. A New Line Cinema release. Running time 118 minutes. Language some sexual references.

"New Years Eve movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs New Years Eve Marshall plan for the holidays a 2 starsDirector moves on with another entourage of lightly used talentDecember 08 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticScrambling to accommodate its Big Gulp of an ensemble cast for which disaster movie maven Irwin Allen wouldve killed ""New Years Eve"" does for its holiday what last years ""Valentines Day"" did for Valentines Day. If this ones a hit as was ""V Day"" (200 million worldwide) surely we can expect ""Presidents Day."" With nice cameos for actual ex-presidents.As with ""Valentines Day"" the template for director Garry Marshall and screenwriter Katherine Fugate is ""Love American Style"" except with some of the plotlines interconnecting. I counted eight narratives duking it out in ""New Years Eve"" which is set in New York City on Dec. 31. Hilary Swank plays the overseer of the big ball drop (Mayor Michael Bloomberg looking a lot like Joel Grey makes an appearance) but the ball has mechanical problems which means a cameo for Marshalls eternal good-luck charm Hector Elizondo. I always enjoy Elizondo; he has a way of elevating some pretty lame banter and thanks to ""New Years Eve"" he has his way all over again.Elsewhere in the great big city a wondrous toy just made for a girl and boy Ashton Kutcher and Lea Michele are stuck in an elevator together. Robert De Niro lies dying in a hospital hoping to see the ball drop from the rooftop one last time. Halle Berry is his nurse. Michelle Pfeiffer is the mousy record company executive who cuts loose with the help of hopped-up delivery boy-man Zac Efron. Katherine Heigl (playing a Type A control freak for a change) and Jon Bon ""Blase Beyond Previously Known Human Limits"" Jovi discuss past heartache and future prospects at the swank New Years Eve party hosted by Cherry Jones whose son Josh Duhamel is stuck in Connecticut and trying to get back. Sarah Jessica Parker is the mother of Abigail Breslin the latter desperate to get off on her own with her pals.And theres so much more Each beat and every clunky reaction shot encourages the actors to push it like Jessica Biel in the birthing plotline. Marshall knows a certain kind of comedy but his technique has a way of pitting performers squarely against their own material. But you could do worse. You could see ""Jack and Jill"" for example.Near the end of ""New Years Eve"" Berry lands a moment of genuine emotion sharing a brief scene (theyre all brief; as Shakespeare once said tedious but brief) with her beloved. You almost cant believe its happening; its the sole instance in a proudly superficial product that lands quietly at a human midpoint between synthetic happiness and manufactured pathos.Also De Niro gets off a nice under-the-breath zinger in the end-credits outtakes.mjphillipstribune.comNew Years Eve -- 2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for language including some sexual references)Running time 157Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated Articles4 days.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr HIGH RESOLUTIONS Ashton Kutcher and Lea Michele in New Years Eve (Andrew Schwartz) B- New Years Eve Genre Comedy Romance; Starring Jessica Biel Robert De Niro Josh Duhamel Zac Efron Katherine Heigl Ashton Kutcher Lea Michele Sarah Jessica Parker Michelle Pfeiffer Sofia Vergara; Director Garry Marshall; Author Katherine Fugate; Release Date Wide 12/09/2011; Runtime (in minutes) 117; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted December 15 2011 -- 1200 AM EST New Years Eve a schlock ensemble love-o-rama timed for the season of easy good feeling is a movie I often found myself laughing at in ridicule and one that also gave me a lump in the throat. So I guess you could say I had a good time. The movie like last years Valentines Day was written by Katherine Fugate and directed by Garry Marshall and I can just imagine Marshall showing up on the set to basically shout seven words ""Action"" ""All right everybody overact"" ""Okay cut"" If you had to pick the cheesiest subplot your head might explode. Is it Jon Bon Jovi as a rock star trying to win back the fiancee he dumped -- a superchef played by Katherine Heigl who looks as if she can barely slice a pineapple? Is it Ashton Kutcher as a smirk-aleck stuck on a grimy elevator with an agonizingly sincere backup singer (Lea Michele)? Is it Hilary Swank as a Times Square exec who saves the dropping New Years Eve ball from mechanical failure? (She calls...Kominsky A repairman with funny Russian accent) Or is it Robert De Niro as a dying man with a bucket-list wish so wispy that the entire anecdote seems designed to let De Niro shoot his scenes in less than an hour? New Years Eve is dunderheaded kitsch but its the kind of marzipan movie that can sweetly soak up a holiday evening.

New Years Eve Bad Director Garry Marshall. Cast Halle Berry Jessica Biel Jon Bon Jovi Robert De Niro Josh Duhamel Katherine Heigl Ashton Kutcher Sarah Jessica Parker Michelle Pfeiffer Hilary Swank. Rating PG-13 for language including some sexual references. This weeks new movie release Spotlight Robert De Niro Spotlight Jessica Biel Spotlight Sarah Jessica Parker Chick flicks Different holiday same sherbet. The formula -- interwoven vignettes following dozens of characters who occasionally cross paths on their way to a schmaltzy ending -- does have its advantages. Because each story adds up to only a few minutes of screen time you can afford enough A-listers to turn the movie into a ""Wheres Waldo?"" game of spot-a-celebrity. Better yet the characters and their cookie-cutter quirks never have a chance to wear out their welcome despite having the emotional depth of a Hallmark commercial. Theres Katherine Heigl as a restaurateur who slices pineapples (isnt that lowly prep work?) in a spotless chefs coat and perfectly coifed locks who spends the movie sparring with her once and future boyfriend a rock star who goes by his last name of Jensen (Jon Bon Jovi). Sarah Jessica Parker shows up as the overprotective mother of Abigail Breslin and Ashton Kutcher plays a New Years scrooge who gets stuck in an elevator with a gorgeous backup singer (""Glees"" Lea Michele). On the tearjerking side Robert De Niro is a lonely man dying of cancer and for comic relief theres Jessica Biel and Seth Meyers as a couple scheming to win the cash prize for giving birth to the first baby of the new year which gives screenwriter Katherine Fugate an excuse to use the word ""va-jay-jay."" Michelle Pfeiffer plays against type as a mousy middle-age wallflower who offers a young hunk (Zac Efron) four tickets to Manhattans hottest New Years Eve bash if he can help her complete a bucket list of ""resolutions"" which include traveling the world saving a life and ""be(ing) amazed."" And he displays remarkable ingenuity in making her dreams come true which raises the question How is it that a 20-something bicycle courier can secure onstage access to Radio City Musical Hall but cant talk his way into a party? Ah but such niceties as plausibility and originality are beside the point for a movie in which Times Squares party planner (Hilary Swank) holds a press conference to discuss technical problems with the ball drop and ends up exhorting the world to ""remember to be nice to each other ... the whole year long."" It is the cinematic equivalent of a greeting card Both the sentiment and the laughs are plentiful cheap and forgettable. Reach the reviewer at kerry.lengelarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4896.

"New Years Eve | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Review New Years Eve Andrew Barker Senior Features Writer barkerrant 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr December 6 2011 | 0300PM PT The film is pushed to punishing lengths by the engorged cast list which prevents any individual plot from deepening beyond single-sentence character descriptions and dilemmas. It takes a certain filmmaking sensibility to make a two-hour massive-ensemble comedy set almost entirely in Times Square on New Years Eve and yet not allow a single character to get drunk. In that sense Garry Marshall deserves some credit for the risk-averse ""New Years Eve"" which revisits the narrative apparatus of his 2010 ""Valentines Day"" (written by Katherine Fugate who also scripted here) to even lesser returns. Still fans of Hallmark-card sentiment and slumming stars of which there are plenty should produce strong if unspectacular first-week business. Offering around a dozen barely there aggressively agreeable mini-stories spliced together and spit out with lawnmower-style eloquence the film is pushed to punishing lengths by the engorged cast list which prevents any individual plot from deepening beyond single-sentence character descriptions and dilemmas. The overall effect is like being crushed under an avalanche of throw pillows. The worst of the vignettes features parents-to-be Seth Meyers and Jessica Biel competing with another couple to have the first baby born in the New Year which occasions some upsettingly prolific use of the words ""hoo-hah"" and ""va-jay-jay."" Elsewhere caterer Katherine Heigl is the scorned ex-paramour of a Jon Bon Jovi-like rock star (Jon Bon Jovi); Ashton Kutcher and Lea Michele are hipster neighbors trapped in a bizarrely roomy well-appointed elevator; Robert De Niro and Halle Berry are a cancer patient and attending nurse respectively; Sarah Jessica Parker and Abigail Breslin have an ill-defined mother-daughter feud; Hilary Swank is in charge of planning the Times Square ball drop; Josh Duhamel is stranded out in the sticks; and Sofia Vergara and Russell Peters allow the filmmakers to laugh at their respective accents. The strangest thread and the only one that seems to suggest a more interesting story hidden somewhere beneath involves Zac Efron as an eminently smackable jive-talking bike messenger hired by a harried secretary (Michelle Pfeiffer) to help her fill out a list of increasingly elaborate New Years resolutions (although with such entries as ""be amazed"" and ""go to Bali"" she appears to have mistaken resolutions for letters to Santa). At times seeming to suggest that Pfeiffers character is on the verge of suicide and at others planting the strangely alluring possibility of a Harold-and-Maude romance the pairing is just off enough to be intriguing. And then ... absolutely nothing happens with it. Very little happens anywhere else either. Few of the plot strands connect to one another much less resolve themselves with any degree of wit or daring. The filmmakers seem to have never heard of Chekhovs gun and go to great lengths to mention specific character traits or draw relationships between distant characters only to drop them immediately afterward. Balancing this glut of stories also results in some inelegant dialogue; at times characters even interrupt one anothers expository lines with other unrelated equally expository lines. Most of the actors at least seem to be enjoying themselves and none seem overly concerned about creating actual characters in such limited environs. Second-unit photography paints a pleasantly superficial tourist-oriented picture of New York though many key narrative moments look strangely gauzy and ill shot. Setting most of the film in billboard-choked Times Square provides for extensive product-placement opportunities in ostensibly unobtrusive fashion most notably with a lovingly extended shot of an ad for fellow upcoming Warner Bros. release ""Sherlock Holmes A Game of Shadows.""

TWITTER ""Valentines Day"" director Garry Marshall brings a big-name cast together for intertwined stories playing out on the last night of the year. Returning with the cast-of-thousands multiple storyline approach they applied to Valentines Day Garry Marshall and screenwriter Katherine Fugate take on New Years Eve but this time out the result proves to be as appealing and effervescent as a flute of flat champagne. PHOTOS New Years Eve Premiere Red Carpet Arrivals A remarkably maudlin affair that possesses scant evidence of Marshalls trademark brisk efficiency the trite romantic comedy may technically take place on the last night of 2011 but it feels stuck at least 30 years in the past. Despite the attempts of a sprawling all-star ensemble to lend their flimsy characters any sort of involving definition the majority end up lost in the perpetual shuffle. While Warner Bros. could still ring in some decent numbers the tally will likely fall well short of the 110 million enticed by Valentines Day. VIDEO New Years Eve Star Abigail Breslin Talks About Her First On-Screen Kiss Using a potentially intriguing p.o.v. as its jump-off point--the behind-the-scenes orchestrations leading up to the annual Times Square ball drop--the film squanders many rich possibilities as it flits indifferently from story to story and character to character. Among them Hilary Swank as the stressed-out newly-promoted vp of the Times Square Alliance responsible for making sure the big countdown goes off without a hitch; Robert De Niro as a terminal cancer patient determined to take in the action down in the street; Jon Bon Jovi as a rock star and Katherine Heigl as the one he let get away who happens to be catering the big bash at which hell be performing. VIDEO Lea Michele Reveals Secret Behind Her New Years Eve Chemistry with Ashton Kutcher Then theres Sarah Jessica Parker as a single mom having relationship problems with teenage daughter Abigail Breslin; and Lea Michele as a back-up singer who finds herself stuck in her buildings stalled elevator with a jerky neighbor (Ashton Kutcher). VIDEO New Years Eve Trailer Ashton Kutcher Lea Michele Zac Efron Ring in 2012 Elsewhere landing with a particular thud are a pair of strained plotlines--one involving Michelle Pfeiffer as a meek mousy office assistant who enlists the aid of bike messenger Zac Efron to help her realize a bucket list of unfulfilled resolutions. The other features Jessica Biel and Seth Meyers and Sarah Paulson and Til Schweiger as a pair of expectant couples who face off in a fierce battle to take home the hospitals 25000 prize awarded to the first birth of the new year. They mainly succeed in inducing groans. PHOTOS Ashton Kutchers Career Through the Years To add to all the fun the glittering countdown ball has gotten stuck during a run-through much to the displeasure of Swank not to mention Ryan Seacrest who gripes that it wouldnt have happened to Dick Clark. While on the subject of dropping the ball in spite of Marshalls endeavors to keep them all in the air Fulgates cavalcade of cliched characters never come convincingly together for a common cause. VIDEO New Years Eve Second Trailer Shows Off Star Power Ultimately their intertwined forced stories play out like schmaltzy Altman. Only Halle Berry manages to mine some honest gravity as a night nurse who has a poignant celebration lined up come midnight but like so many of the performances in the distancing incohesive New Years Eve it felt like it came from a completely separate movie.

""New Years Eve"" is the second in a remarkably shallow series of holiday-themed celebrity-stuffed confections from director Garry Marshall and screenwriter Katherine Fugate following their 2010 ""Valentines Day"" collaboration. Of course the really good stuff will come once they get to ""Columbus Day"" or maybe just maybe ""Ash Wednesday.""Many of the elements are the same as they were for ""Valentines Day"" just moved back on the calendar a few weeks with the script again weaving together a dozen or so plot lines that crisscross a holiday prone to sentimentalizing.If there is some kind of world record for schmaltz this may have set it. Included here are first kisses midnight rendezvous dying fathers newborn babies husbands at war and trapped strangers. Its narcotic mawkishness with notes played on heartstrings like a 12-string guitar.Though its pure rosy fantasy on screen this is cynical paint-by-the-numbers entertainment sold with a gaggle of stars spread across its movie poster like a telethon lineup.The threads of romance emanate from -- where else? -- New Yorks Times Square. Hilary Swank plays a character running the ball drop festivities at which a famous rocker (Jon Bon Jovi as ""Jensen"") is to perform and where various police keep watch including one played by Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges.Some of the footage from these scenes came from last years New Years in Times Square shot by cinematographer Charles Minsky. This surely is the films biggest accomplishment The atmosphere is very true to the Times Square celebration.Katherine Heigl plays a chef catering a pre-party featuring Jensen who happens to be her ex-boyfriend. Her sous chef is Sofia Vergara of ""Modern Family.""Abigail Breslin now a teenager is hoping to join her friends in Times Square but her mother (Sarah Jessica Parker) wont let her. Jessica Biel with husband Seth Meyers is going into labor competing for the new years first baby against a rival couple (Sarah Paulson Til Schweiger).Michelle Pfeiffer plays a meek office assistant who quits her job (John Lithgow plays her record-label executive boss a good bit of casting that should have spawned laughs) and hires a courier (an ultra-confident Zac Efron) to help her accomplish a list of resolutions.Ashton Kutcher as a bearded grouch gets stuck in an elevator for hours with backup singer Lea Michele. (I crossed my fingers that bathroom needs would spoil their budding romance but alas.) Most incredulous perhaps is the pairing of nurse Halle Berry and dying Vietnam veteran Robert De Niro.En route to love and new beginnings the many characters run around familiar New York tourist attractions and pair off predictably.Editor Michael Tronick deserves credit for stitching all of these corny story lines together smoothly. None of the characters are more than cardboard cliches but the cast is likable and pretty enough (there are some rom-com pros here including Heigl and Josh Duhamel) that most are able to swallow the pallid dialogue without causing inadvertent laughs.The cameos keep coming until the end with even Mayor Michael Bloomberg dropping by. After all this is as much an ad for New York as it is a movie. And Im pretty sure I spotted Knick Amare Stoudemire as the credits rolled. Obviously the NBA lockout was very hard on players.And its during these lighthearted extras and outtakes at the end of ""New Years Eve"" where the first and only honest moment of the film occurs. Carla Gugino who plays the OB/GYN delivering the expected babies hints at the crassness of the enterprise. In a gag she emerges from between Biels legs with not a child but ""Valentines Day"" DVDs.Congratulations. Its dreck.""New Years Eve"" a Warner Bros.

A movie so excruciating that it makes its predecessor Valentines Day seem like Nashville in comparison NYE reteams Marshall with VD writer Katherine Fugate who reprises the same crisscrossing multigenerational-celebrity-glutted (to list only half of the cast would take up the entire space allotted for this review) multiple plot threads of the earlier film. New York City serves like Los Angeles did in VD as the metropolis flattened by dull location shots and ethnic caricatures Sofia Vergara playing a sous-chef says !Ay to boss Katherine Heigl more times in one sentence than in an entire season of Modern Family. Still that interjection is much more pleasing to the ear than ""Love gives us hope. Hope for the New Year."" In such a shameless olio of mawkishness its difficult to distinguish which of the story lines most outrageously bids for our tears though I nominate the one involving Robert De Niro as a former ""photojournalist in Vietnam"" dying of cancer. More troubling is that both VD and NYE have featured perfunctory nods to soldiers overseas which can mean only one thing Veterans Day set in Washington D.C. is next.
