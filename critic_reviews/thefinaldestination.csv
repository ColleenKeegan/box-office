Probably the most polished U.S. title in this years After Dark Horrorfest veteran assistant/second unit director Joey Stewarts feature directorial bow ""The Final"" has a group of high school outcasts wreaking elaborate vengeance on tormenting classmates. Pic takes itself pretty seriously which works during the buildup less so once it veers into torture-porn terrain. For better or worse resulting queasy mix of horror conventions and Columbine-type exploitation is likely to win some fans via Lionsgate DVD release next month. Five kids endlessly picked on by their suburban schools noxious jocks and jockettes (who are a bit over-caricatured) anonymously invite those foes to a costume party on rural property recently inherited by Dane (Marc Donato). Knocked out by spiked punch the attendees awaken chained together their masked hosts promising they wont be killed -- but by nights end theyll wish they had been. One by one theyre subjected to harsh gruesome punishment for prior cruelties though of course not everything goes as planned. Leads (several former child thesps) and handling are good though theres some stilted dialogue and too much stagy lecturing by Dane in Jason Kabolatis script.

"Review The Final Destination - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-ReviewMOVIE REVIEW Review The Final DestinationOnce again attractive young people try to cheat death. Silly them. The filmmakers waste little plot or character development on dispatching them with 3-D gore.August 31 2009|Gary Goldstein It doesnt take 3-D trickery to see everything coming at you from a mile away in ""The Final Destination"" the silly and predictable fourth installment in the lucrative thriller series about pretty young people attempting to cheat death. Director David R. Ellis and writer Eric Bress who previously collaborated on ""Final Destination 2"" unimaginatively rehash the earlier films basic premise Someone foresees a gruesome group death that may or may not play out in reality if the order of the originally envisioned victims can be disrupted.Though this latest entry has an OK sense of humor moves swiftly enough and sports an effective opening sequence of racetrack destruction that puts its Fusion 3-D technology to good use it mostly comes off as a particularly flimsy excuse to string together a bunch of gory killings.Its at the doomed speedway that good guy Nick (Bobby Campo) inexplicably has a premonition in which he and his girlfriend Lori (Shantel VanSanten) their best friends Janet (Haley Webb) and cavalier stud Hunt (Nick Zano) along with various other spectators are killed as the result of a horrific race car crash. Unhinged by his grisly prophecy Nick persuades the crowd to make a hasty exit just seconds before the hell he imagined actually breaks loose saving the lives of most everyone around him."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""160""gt;But later when Nicks fatal visions continue and the folks from the speedway start dying in the order he first predicted the race is on to save all those on Nicks mental list before they prematurely meet their ""final destinations"" via a series of outlandish Rube Goldberg-esque accidents. Can one town really have so many public structures that are literally coming apart at the seams?Aside from an unnerving ride through a self-serve carwash the rest of these death or near-death scenes are unmemorable and squeeze out few thrills from the 3-D process.

She strikes up the affair after hand-delivering a pair of pants and within minutes their living room-floor intimacy goes beyond whether Werner dresses left or right. Rather than a tale of geriatric groove-getting German director Andreas Dresens film dwells on Inges ambivalent compartmentalizing Shes in love with her reliable companion of three decades yet newly contented with her escape from routine and demurring when pressed about her intentions. German theater veterans the age-appropriate actors improvised their dialogue but often accomplish more through silence and the eloquence of their old faces. The psychology is rudimentary however and Werner the caring Other Man is little more than a sketch a hale figure out of a prescription-drug ad. Inges vacillations are mechanically interspersed with her participation in a choir and family gatherings. Besides the frank blithe sex scenes a melodramatic ending aims to banish any last hope of gemutlichkeit but the film comes to feel curiously incomplete like one long fretful afternoon. (Royal; Playhouse 7; Town Center 5) (Nicolas Rapold) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - THE FINAL DESTINATION Fatality lurks around every ceiling fan shampoo bottle and espresso machine in the fourth entry in New Line Cinemas improbably long-running death-by-misadventure franchise focused on yet another group of friends who narrowly escape a catastrophic accident only to learn the hard way that when your numbers up it really is up. The Grim Reaper seems to have taken a hit from the lean economic times judging from The Final Destinations el cheapo Canada-as-Anytown USA production values and sub-One Tree Hill cast; but as usual all that is merely fuel for the series signature domino-effect death scenes here rendered in shlock-o-riffic 3-D by director David R. Ellis (Final Destination 2 Snakes on a Plane) bringing all manner of bodily impalement and dismemberment as close as the butter on your popcorn. Ellis and screenwriter Eric Bress even go all meta on us with an Inglourious Basterds-esque finale set inside a 3D cinema though their set pieces never quite muster the giddy brio of Final Destination 1 and 3 auteur James Wong at his best. They come close however in what Im fairly certain is the silver screens first episode of pool-drain disembowelment. And to think people say there are no fresh ideas in Hollywood anymore. (Citywide) (Scott Foundas)FIVE MINUTES OF HEAVEN Guy Hibberts novel-writing process for Five Minutes of Heaven is an interesting experiment. In 1975 Ulster Alistair Little killed Catholic Joe Griffens brother; decades later Alistair and Griffen unburdened themselves to Hibbert about the event and speculated on what would happen if they ever met. (They never did.) Then Hibbert wrote this movie. He and director Oliver Hirschbiegel use the killing itself as a starting point in an atmospheric prologue. The production design is spot-on but Hirschbiegel tries way too hard to create tension making every occurrence -- a record needle dropping a car door slamming -- an unsubtle potential bomb fraying your nerves like a cheap horror movie. The next two acts are hypotheticals Little (Liam Neeson) and Griffen (James Nesbitt) almost meet 25 years after the shooting while taping a BBC program about reconciliation but Griffen backs out at the last second. This near-brush plays out as a bad one-act play with internal monologues on both sides; Neesons too calmly patrician to convey Littles real inner turmoil though Nesbitts Griffen is hilariously splenetic. Its a hell of a show when he goes off but nothing can be done with lines like ""Thats the trouble with me. I have all the wrong feelings."" Then finally theres the physical confrontation which plays like a bone-crunching and foleyd-out fight scene from the Bourne series. The three parts never coalesce even if they all have potential. (Nuart) (Vadim Rizov) HALLOWEEN II Serial killer Michael Myers it turns out has mother issues. In this disappointing sequel to his intense and much underrated 2007 remake of John Carpenters 1978 classic Halloween rock star turned filmmaker Rob Zombie sends Michael (Tyler Mane) on another killing spree at the urging of his now-dead mom (Sheri Moon Zombie) who appears (all too frequently) as a beckoning ghost standing next to a white horse. Once again Michael hunts baby-sitter extraordinaire Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) whos living one year after the first films murders with the town sheriff (Brad Dourif). In his 2007 movie Zombie dug deep into Michaels screwed-up white-trash family history a process which humanized Michael and made his subsequent brutality all the more unsettling. This time Zombie doesnt appear to have many deep thoughts so Michael doesnt just stab his victims he slices and chomps them into gooey pulp -- an overkill motif that actually feels false to the character and quickly becomes a depressing bore. As evidenced by his previous Halloween flick and 2005s astonishing (and irredeemably brutal) The Devils Rejects Zombie has talent to burn but hes slumming here and one suspects that he knows it. (Citywide) (Chuck Wilson) Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat. Sep. 10 1200pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On the CW Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm THE OPEN ROAD Justin Timberlake cuts such a cocky carefree figure in his videos and on Saturday Night Live that its surprising (not to mention physically uncomfortable) to watch him struggle through The Open Road a weak pulse of a father-and-son road drama. Timberlake plays Carlton a slumping Texas minor-league ballplayer whose ailing mother (Mary Steenburgen) asks him to track down his estranged father Kyle ""Lone Star"" Garrett (Jeff Bridges) a celebrated retired slugger who spends his time charming fans at conventions and uttering Dan Rather-worthy down-home expressions like ""That girls finer than the hair on a frog."" With his supportive ex-girlfriend Lucy (Kate Mara) by his side Carlton flies to Ohio to retrieve dad but complications force the trio to drive back to Texas which provides many opportunities for random conflicts and heartfelt conversations -- and for viewers to check their watches. Unceremoniously dumped into theaters without advance screenings The Open Road isnt an unwatchable howler -- instead writer-director Michael Merediths film is merely dull and obvious. As for Timberlake his success as a pop star is attributable to his graceful nonchalance which registers as awkward shallowness when set against The Open Roads leaden earnest conventionality. Even worse only one of the two male leads sings during the film -- and its not J.T. (Sunset 5) (Tim Grierson)ORGIES AND THE MEANING OF LIFE To maintain erections while bedding a succession of women Baxter (played by writer-director Brad T. Gottfred) fantasizes that hes surrounded by a bevy of sexually compliant partners from his past including his strap-on wearing ex-wife who sodomizes him. These imagined orgies arent just about orgasm however theyre part of Baxters quest to resolve his existential angst. Working with the earnestness and philosophical depth of an undergrad film student Gottfred (a sexy average-Joe type) blends familiar tropes the struggling writer trying to get past a mental block; the son trying to wiggle out of the shadow of an overbearing religious father; the male artist forcing the roles of muse and savior on the women in his life. The sum isnt freshness; its tedium. Dialogue ranges from exposition-heavy to cutesy (""I think Im stalking you. Please stalk me back"") while the performances are little better. Orgies lone strength are its animated sequences in which Baxters stick-figure stand-in embarks on a quest to find a portal into the 3-D world. Though the symbolism is heavy-handed and the writing as cliched as in the live-action scenes these interludes have an energy and poignancy otherwise lacking in the film. (Grande 4-Plex) (Ernest Hardy)PLAY THE GAME In 2007 Waitress established that octogenarian TV legend Andy Griffith still had game as a sly charmer but Marc Fienbergs poky romcom does his legacy no favors by casting Griffith as an accidentally subversive caricature of his Mayberry prime. ""Grandpas horny"" declares Griffiths lonely widow Joe with sitcom believability and in a parallel twist on boob-tube history his estranged son is played by Ron Howards goofy brother Clint. But this Lifetime-ready comedy is hardly provocative -- let alone perceptive funny or fresh -- so the respect Fienberg mightve earned for addressing the love lives of the elderly is squashed by its insipid A plot in which Joes playboy grandson David (Paul Campbell) must learn to grow up and stop single-mindedly chasing pussy. The young pick-up artist teaches the old dog some gimmicky tricks buying his gramps a baby blue tracksuit and backward baseball cap and offering him piggish formulas that begin like ""Step 1 ... reconnaissance."" The reversal is predictable David suddenly schemes for monogamous companionship with characterless cutie Julie (Marla Sokoloff) while Joe pops Viagra and humps half the retirement home. Were thankfully only treated to a chaste closeup of Griffiths doughy puppet face as hes getting head -- think Avenue Q. (Music Hall; Town Center 5) (Aaron Hillis)THIS BEAUTIFUL CITY Beware films in which characters have been saddled with ironic names in Toronto playwright Ed Gass-Donnellys multihyphenate debut feature This Beautiful City Kristin Booth plays a perpetually wasted prostitute named Pretty. Along with her strung-out boyfriend Johnny (Aaron Poole) Pretty occupies the lowest rung of Torontos social ladder but as Gass-Donnellys script (adapted from his own play Descent) labors to illustrate a loftier economic perch is no guarantor of happiness either. The films first act finds Johnny and Pretty bearing witness to the maybe-accidental balcony plunge of condo-frau Carol (Caroline Cave) previously seen bitching at her husband Harry (Noam Jenkins) -- the implication being that this well-manicured young woman opted for suicide over one more day in upscale-young-married hell. But Carol survives and the film continues with the two couples brought into each others orbit through a series of elaborate (and generally predictable) narrative contrivances. After establishing at length that were dealing with spectacularly damaged people (but of course This is a Canadian drama) the plot works itself into a melodramatic lather of anguished breakups cross-caste hookups and looming violence shot in a ragged blur of super 16mm -- that tired ersatz signifier of urban ""reality."" The only real notes of authenticity are struck by the actors and even then only on the distaff side. Booth -- last seen as one of the Young People Fucking -- plays against her looks without descending into grotesquerie while Cave playing a woman in the midst of a troubled convalescence (as she did in David Christensens excellent Six Figures) gives a physically fearless performance. (Grande 4-Plex) (Adam Nayman)  GO  WORLDS GREATEST DAD Playing dark Robin Williams has developed the burly insecurity and gargoyle frown of damned Edward G. Robinson in Fritz Langs Scarlet Street -- with Worlds Greatest Dad he almost has the movie to match. Lance (Williams) is an unpublished serial novelist and an unpopular poetry teacher at the same high school attended by the son Kyle (Daryl Sabara) he is raising alone who incarnates every nightmare of downloaded premature debauchery a physical virgin and Caligula of the mind. Sabara whose few scenes of abject irredeemability leave a lingering stain on the movie is point man for a perfect cast with the standouts including his lone sallow school friend Evan Martin and Henry Simmons as an alpha-male teacher and unflattering contrast to Lance. The particular stew of midlife and pubescent despair that clogs a single-father male-child household has rarely been achieved so well Lances parental tough love is a trailed-off ""ahh ..."" The details of leftover dinosaur-themed wallpaper (unnoticed as it peels) and the dirty sneaker prints on the glove compartment are enough to convince that screenwriter-director Bobcat Goldthwait knows his stuff. His cringer lands improbably on its feet after every reckless plot turn -- involving autoerotic asphyxiation and fraudulent authorship -- all the way until an over-fondness for music montage fells it in the last reel.

But its not really the destination that matters. (Courtesy of New Line Cinema) Elizabeth Weitzman Saturday August 29 2009 622 AM Title Despite the racecars that wreak such outrageous havoc in ""The Final Destination"" the fourth installment of this unkillable series is definitely the go-kart entry in the weekends horror face-off. If you like your gore hardcore youll want to head straight for ""Halloween II."" But if youre happy to ease around a slightly smaller track look no further.What the ""FD"" franchise does best is recognize its place as uncomplicated instantly forgettable fun. Director David R. Ellis and writer Eric Bress barely break a sweat but they do keep up their end of the deal by sticking to a formula thats never faltered survivors of an accident are stalked by a reaper with a stubborn streak and a wicked sense of humor.This time around a bunch of twentysomething friends start out at the racetrack where Nick (Bobby Campo) envisions an impending disaster. He convinces the rest to leave just in time but of course that just means hes prolonged their agony. Death doesnt like to be cheated so Nick watches as first one friend and then another dies in absurdly nasty fashion. He and the tracks security guard (Mykelti Williamson) believe theres a way to break the chain but theyre up against a pretty formidable foe.If youve seen one--or three--other ""FD"" movies you know where this ends. But its not really the destination that matters. Its the trip which inevitably goes from suspenseful setup to last-minute twist to demented demise. Fires explosions and crashes all figure prominently but Ellis is equally happy to make the most of a misplaced rock or untied shoelace. (Its definitely worth choosing the 3D option; just watch out for flying eyeballs.)With the exception of Williamson the actors are as disposable as their characters and there is no story to speak of. Instead everyone appears fully focused on the primary goal to deliver tongue-in-cheek suspense until the moment the victims cheek is blown to shreds. Every installment of ""FD"" feels like a next-generation copy of the last--slightly weaker but still recognizable. Fans know just what theyre getting and as long as they dont expect anything more theyll get what they came for. Horror sequel about friends who try to cheat death. With Mykelti Williamson Bobby Campo. Director David R. Ellis (122). R extreme violence language sexuality partial nudity. At area theaters.

As cars come hurtling off the track the mass pandemonium recalls that of early-60s shockers like The Blob but the crucial hook isnt the chaos Its the shot of a man impaled through his mouth by a splintered bench which pokes right into the audience making us feel impaled. Once again a group of pretty young things who have escaped the opening disaster proceed to die one by one as fate catches up with them. The jokey heightened Gen Y-Omen gruesomeness never lets up -- there are burnings and beheadings and one dude gets turned into raw shish kebab when hes mashed through a chain-link fence. But the in-between filler with Nick (Bobby Campo) addled by premonitions scurrying to stop each death before it occurs is about as extraneous as a horror-movie plot can get. (If Nick didnt keep failing there wouldnt be a movie.) Its no exaggeration to say that the actors have less personality than the pipes nail guns grinding gears decaying beams and slowly spreading oil spills that are fused with a kind of empty-dread technical precision into Rube Goldberg torture devices.

Comments click to enlarge The Final Destination 2009 ""Death Be Not Boring"" would have been a better title for this fourth installment in the teen splatter franchise. The formula involves several characters narrowly escaping death only to be hunted down later by an invisible Grim Reaper and killed in freakish accidents. This time the daisy chain of doom begins at a stock car race from which four youngsters and as many adults flee just before a bargain-basement CGI disaster takes out half the crowd. They get theirs but the Rube Goldberg variations are repetitive and devoid of the visual snap that helped distinguish James Wongs Final Destination (2000). Director David R. Ellis (Snakes on a Plane) neglects the basics of his craft in favor of in-your-face 3-D folderol. Lots of people do get killed though. R 86 min.

The movie made paranoia just contagious enough for you to leave the theater nervous a bus would run you over.Two sequels later comes ""The Final Destination allegedly the last in the series in which a different young man (Bobby Campo) tries to put the brakes on death. In 3-D. So now when a hurtling tire decapitates one woman and a speeding rock fatally puts out the eye of another its as if each object were first coming for you. Yet nothing about that tire or that rock is exciting enough to make you jump.All this third cheaply rendered dimension contributes is an awareness of how nondimensional everything else is. The writers dont write the director doesnt really direct and the actors dont exactly act. They wait for the movies contraptions to impale them. The guys look like personal trainers the women like salespeople at Forever 21.The gamesmanship is still heartless. The movie presents entire disaster sequences as real then basically say ""Psych It was a premonition and stages it again. If were not meant to be afraid were not laughing either. I searched for the joke in the image of a black character (poor Mykelti Williamson) sitting around while a noose hangs casually around his neck. Strange I never found it.The climax happens at a giant shopping center inside a megaplex - an opportunity at self-deprecation blown. The setting seems off anyway. As franchises go this installment wouldnt make it to a real mall. ""The Final Destination is the movie equivalent of a struggling strip-mall store wedged between Metro PCS and a pawn shop.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Heres a question What seemingly friendly force keeps gifting pretty twentysomethings with prophetic visions in the Final Destination movies enabling them to oh-so-temporarily escape death? Is there some positive influence in the universe working to counteract fate? If so why is it so incompetent at what it does? Alternately is the Grim Reaper just fucking with these poor kids by magically granting them reprieves then even more magically hunting them down one by one? Why does any of this happen? Unfortunately thats a question The Final Destination never bothers to ask as it goes through the rote motions established by the first three films in the franchise. Once again a near-victim (Bobby Campo) receives a precognitive warning about a horrific accident and gets his friends and several bystanders to safety just in time. Death unwilling to be cheated somehow brings unlikely strings of ordinary objects together to reduce the hapless escapees to lovingly rendered chopped wet meat. Thanks to a quick Internet search that brings up evidence of previous Final Destination movies Campo and friends dont even need to engage their brains to figure out whats going on. That leaves a lot more time for ominous music slow concatenations of faulty machinery and spilled solvents and explosions that (particularly for those watching the 3D version) fling shrapnel right in viewers faces. If the Final Destination movies teach us anything its that everything around us is decaying and dangerous and might at any moment become one piece in a monstrous Rube Goldberg execution device. The Final Destination is one such mechanical device churning out each new splattery accident with predictable regularity and a lot of in-your-face gory shocks but few surprises. Its chopping-block fodder is agonizingly bland; each character has one prominent major flaw or no personality at all. Campos generic CGI visions of random objects similarly lack any flavor; only the few rough stabs at R-rated humor like the flying flaming severed head with the goofy expression actually provide a shot of adrenaline. As with his last theatrical outing Snakes On A Plane director David R. Ellis aims for the laziest most easily satisfied thriller fans but he even lets them down by frontloading the action putting all the most creative kills--the one reason to attend a film like this--early on such that the whole movie is just one increasingly dull roll downhill. The same could be said for this once-fresh franchise.

But until that day arrives theres absolutely no reason not to enjoy The Final Destination a film which doesnt just pride itself on the spikiest shiniest collection of audience-intimidating implements yet seen (nails knives scissors screwdrivers) but adds a whole host of hitherto unimagined threats from flaming cars rogue ceiling fans and even a killer car wash.The plot is familiar from previous instalments in the Final Destination series forgettable well-sculpted do-gooder receives visions of impending disaster (in this case a nasty Nascar pileup) and hustles his chums out of danger. This causes the non-corporeal spirit of random death to become mightily peeved and come gunning for each of them in a variety of inventive and increasingly budget-taxing ways.Theres not a great deal to defend in The Final Destination the characters are flimsy and interchangeable the actors portraying them bland and inoffensive. The script serves as merely a framework for a repetitive series of shock deaths each of which is clearly signposted well in advance. But thats half the fun giggling as the shadow of a loaded crane looms menacingly overhead or a bottle of slippery hair oil tips silently across a well-polished floor. Some of the more gratuitously nasty scenes do leave a sour taste - in particular a gruesome reference to Chuck Palahniuks infamous swimming pool horror story Guts - and the films 15 certificate is surprisingly generous. But this is harmless inventive fun a rollercoaster ride on the 3D bandwagon before the wheels fall off.

Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie review The Final Destination -- 1 out of 5 stars Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic ""Is it safe to sit here?""The girl always asks that in Final Destination movies. The answer on screen is ""Yes yes yes."" But we in the audience know its ""No no no."" As in ""Get out of there. NOW."" In the movie titled The Final Destination showing in many theaters in 3D ""there"" is a stock car race track where the seats are rotting the cement has cracks and the pit crews are the most accident-prone on the planet. A quartet of college kids go one ""sees"" a crowd-killing accident before it happens and convinces his friends to leave. This is followed by a crowd-killing accident. Followed by more chain reaction disasters that take out the survivors who ""should have been killed"" one by one.They called it ""deaths grand design"" in an earlier Destination. In the latest unoriginal exhausted sequel they give it the pedestrian label ""the death list."" The latter Final Destination movies cant fail to make me nostalgic for the James Wong original a movie wrapped up in high school kids who all think theyre immortal anyway wrestling with mortality trying to decode ""deaths grand design"" foreshadowed by the music of John Denver. I was thinking of that one this morning on the way to the office as three ""Im gonna live FOREVER"" teens darted across six lanes of speeding traffic to beat their bus to the stop. Making that generation question its lack of fear of death was fascinating fodder for a horror film.Nine years later these movies have been reduced to bland killing machines though The Final Destination the latest features aggressive use of 3D with everything from race cars tires and engines to nails from a nail gun entrails and blood blasting off the screen into our laps. Blandly acted by players who seem resigned to the paycheck rather than terrified by the prospect of death or paralyzed by fear or even morbidly fascinated by their impending doom this one is certainly worth a pass.Of the blase cast only Mykelti Williamson as a security guard who accepts his fate with the help of his faith and Nick Zano playing a rude crude and funny frat-boy jerk stand out. A few feeble stabs at social commentary -- race-fan racism (an attempted cross-burning) and the magic of 3D at the movies (in one scene they torch a movie theater showing a film in 3D) dont make up for the cheats -- violent accidents that may or may not be premonitions -- or the exciting-as-a-poached egg leading man (Bobby Campo).Its not frightening in the least with only a few amusing moments a pedal-and-forehead-to-the-metal race track crash opener and then you just keep time by counting off who survives the initial slaughter who awaits death when ""their turn"" comes. Eighty minutes and its all over. Until the NEXT Final Destination. A tip? Dont go to stock car races. Dont leave your sun roof open in the car wash. And dont go in any cinema showing The Final Destination in Theater 13.The Final Destination1 of five starsCast Bobby Campo Shantel VanSanten Mykelti Williamson Nick SavoDirector David R.

With an array of gory mayhem only marginally enhanced by 3-D and a plot as developed as a text message ""The Final Destination"" may finally sound the death knell for New Lines near-immortal horror franchise. Clocking in at an expedited 75 minutes (minus credits) of fatally gonzo accidents this fourth installment opens with a stock car-race disaster and then proceeds to dispose of its various stock characters by literally tossing their body parts in the audiences faces. Fans could boost late summer biz but this Reapers prospects otherwise look grim indeed. It opens Friday Stateside sans advance press screenings. Whatever hints of originality lay in the series previous editions have been all but sucked out of this one which focuses purely on its numerous decapitations impalements and mutilations and how to render them more lifelike using Fusion 3-D technology. Even the franchises clever take on teenagers wrestling with notions of fate and death has been eviscerated by scribe Eric Bress (""Final Destination 2"" ""The Butterfly Effect"") whose mostly twentysomething protags are neither students nor gainfully employed though they do excel at being tortured by everything from an escalator to a car wash to a swimming pool pump. While the use of 3-D does provide some thrills as well as a few laughs during the pics opening NASCAR-set massacre -- in which visionary hunk Nick (Bobby Campo) envisions friends and strangers being torn to pieces by flying car parts -- the effect quickly grows tiresome as do the deaths themselves. Once we realize the 3-D is used merely to highlight whatever tool or appliance will soon turn into a weapon and then afterward to spew blood and/or various organs in our direction theres not much else to look out for. As Nicks premonitions (rendered in highly unrealistic CGI graphics) involving those spared by the disaster start to come true he and g.f. Lori (Shantel VanSanten) try to save their best buddies bleached-blond womanizer Hunt (Nick Zano) and gabbing shopaholic Janet (Haley Webb). But along with the other survivors such as the ""Racist"" or ""Redneck"" (as hes referred to at different times) Carter (Justin Welborn) or the ""MILF"" Samantha (Krista Allen) theres hardly anyone here worth preserving. Helmer David R. Ellis who directed the more effective ""Final Destination 2"" and the hilarious ""Snakes on a Plane"" seems to be going for the off-the-wall attitude of the latter but never makes the killings funny enough; nor does he adequately unify time and place to generate suspense. He even grows lazy with regards to the rather creative death scenes that marked the other films Here a guy simply gets hit by an ambulance or has a bathtub fall on his head while a woman is blindsided by a flying rock. So much for Deaths grand designs. When their innards arent splattering through the screen the actors rush through their dialogue explaining the series m.o. -- those who escaped the initial accident are doomed to die in a predetermined order (according to Nick and Lori who ""stayed up Googling premonitions"" to understand whats happening). Such scenes play awkwardly in 3-D the actors looking like cardboard cutouts in front of backgrounds that feel more like green screens than actual sets. Mykelti Williamson (""24"" ""CSI NY"") who plays a widowed security guard grappling with alcoholism manages to give the films one redeemable character some depth before becoming just another sausage for the meat grinder.
