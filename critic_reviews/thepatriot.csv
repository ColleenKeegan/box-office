More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Starring Mel Gibson Heath Ledger and Jason Isaacs. Directed by Roland Emmerich. (R. 158 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The American Revolution was made for color film. The Civil War and World War II can get by on black and white but the revolution -- with its bluecoats and redcoats green fields and blood blood blood -- needs to look like a painting come to life. In this way ""The Patriot"" which opens today succeeds. Alas its the only way in which it succeeds. Director Roland Emmerichs battle scenes may look authentic to anyone who has ever stared hard at a history book but in every other way the film is long empty and bogus. In fact it would be a mistake to think of ""The Patriot"" as a historical film. The movie doesnt deal with the issues of the war and it only touches on its history. Think of it rather as a violent action picture a routine summer bloodbath that in a change of pace uses muskets instead of machine guns and chain saws. Mel Gibson plays a nice guy South Carolina farmer Benjamin Martin who wants nothing to do with the war . . . until the British get him mad. Then look out. Unfortunately since the movie is an absurd ly long 158 minutes the British have to keep getting him mad just to keep things moving. So ""The Patriot"" ends up repeating itself They kill people. Mel kills people. They kill people. Mel kills people . . . Lots of people. Throughout the picture as farmer Ben Gibson has to transform himself from gentle meek and mild to homicidal maniac. In one scene with the help of his little boys (talk about distasteful) he wipes out 19 British soldiers and then wails on No. 20 with a hatchet. By the time hes through he is drenched with blood and so is the movie. Both are just getting started. To justify all this carnage there must be more carnage. Jason Isaacs plays the villain of the piece Col. Tavington and at least this time theres a reason the bad guy has an English accent. Tavington kills civilians kills the wounded kills children. In an incident with chilling echoes of Waco he even massacres a church congregation locking it in a chapel and setting the place on fire. Thats when we know this villain deserves a fate worse than death. He deserves the fate that action movies reserve for only the most wicked death in slow motion. Heath Ledger plays Gabriel the oldest of farmer Bens seven children and he does a good job as a young fellow who impulsively joins the war for romantic reasons but grows a sense of purpose. As for farmer Ben he doesnt get motivated until the war comes literally to his front yard. Thats when he recruits a ragtag band of militiamen -- a supposedly hearty lovable bunch the equivalent of the scruffy fun-loving techies found in sci-fi action films. But their war effort has little emotional payoff for the audience because there is no sense that they are fighting for a cause. At one point someone mentions something about ""taxation without representation"" being bad. Thats as deep as it gets. Actually the only one who says anything about the ""new world"" hes fighting for is a slave trying to earn his freedom. Yet even if the filmmakers perceive no irony in that we certainly do What good will this new world be to a black man in 18th century South Carolina? ""The Patriot"" was written by Robert Rodat who wrote ""Saving Private Ryan"" a credit that sounds impressive until we recall the ""Saving Private Ryan"" screenplay. Emmerich and Rodat bank on the human story to give ""The Patriot"" its power but the relationships are programmatic. Young Gabriel falls in love with a young woman (Lisa Brenner) but she comes off as a goofball. As the widowed Bens sister-in-law and future wife Joely Richardson plays a cipher. Gibson is appealing because hes Gibson and I would not want to trade him for a better actor. But his performance in ""The Patriot"" isnt one of his best. In one scene as Gibson weeps over the body of a dead child the camera has to fade out quickly -- just to keep the bad acting from becoming funny. In other scenes Gibsons strength is his weakness Now in his comfortable middle years Gibson seems like a very nice guy. This makes him easy to take for a full 158 minutes but it also eliminates all sense of menace. When he mutters ""Before this war is over Im going to kill you"" its hard to imagine any self-respecting British villain getting nervous for a second. -- Advisory This film contains graphic violence. ..

Its a death-wish revenge thriller posing as a lavishly pastoral historical epic. Mel Gibson plays Benjamin Martin a South Carolina widower with seven children who organizes a scruffy underground rebel militia to fight the British. Martin a veteran of the French and Indian War thinks of himself as a battle-weary peacenik (his eldest son joins the army against his wishes) but if he believes in liberating the colonies from the tyranny of King George III he believes even more fervently in smiting the holy bejesus out of the soldiers who have torn his family apart. That these aristocratic oppressors happen to be the same redcoats who are fighting to quash the American Revolution is shall we say a matter of the highest moral convenience. Written by Robert Rodat (""Saving Private Ryan"") and directed by the heavy-tromping blockbuster maestro Roland Emmerich (""Independence Day"" ""Godzilla"") ""The Patriot"" is set in fields forests homes and backwaters and theres something at once canny and reductive about the way that it personalizes the bloody birth of a nation. The filmmakers know that the last thing contemporary audiences need is another square-shouldered Classics Illustrated lecture that regurgitates the righteous and idealistic mythology of Why We Fought the British. At the same time Im not sure that I want my history dragged into the colonial trenches by a filmmaker like Roland Emmerich. ""The Patriot"" has some fierce and exciting moments and its held together by Gibsons haggard slow-burn charisma (he talks in his ""low"" voice) but the movie is also demagogic and crude. Its a fife-and-drum ""Gladiator"" without elegance - the Revolutionary War turned into a big hammerheaded spectacle of getting even. The films most irresistible aspect is its clever populist notion of how exactly the colonists defeated the British. At first the opposing armies in their red and blue uniforms line up in stately rows absurdly organized like marching bands with muskets. As the guns crack and the soldiers fall the battles become a stately ritual of mass suicide. The revolutionary forces are the underdogs ragged and barely equipped. Its Martin who has the idea of uniting a militia to stage pinpoint ambushes in the woods. Attacking by stealth he becomes a fearsome legend a ghost of a fighter. In one juicy scene he sneaks out of hiding for an impromptu negotiation with Lord General Cornwallis (Tom Wilkinson) who leads the British troops in the South. Cornwallis is actually an honorable fellow and thats his problem. He approaches armed conflict like a gentleman; he believes in war as a civilized assertion of Empire. What he cant wrap his mind around because it has barely existed before is the notion of a soldier who fights as an individual without rules. As long as it stays on the battlefield ""The Patriot"" is a brutishly compelling broad-canvas entertainment. But the movie is also inflated with cliches from the screenwriters manual. Theres the motley crew of loutish ""colorful"" proles who join Martins militia the squeaky-clean romance between Martins soldier son (Heath Ledger) and a local lass (Lisa Brenner) the vacuously noble slave-turned-soldier (Jay Arlen Jones) who counts down the months before hes freed from servitude and of course the eminently hissable villain - though Jason Isaacs it must be said plays this overripe role to contemptuous perfection. Inevitably he receives the gaudiest of send- offs administered by Mel at his maddest. In ""The Patriot"" freedom is a cause but its also an excuse slaughter enshrined by nobility.

German helmer Roland Emmerichs take on the struggle to form the first true democracy since the ancient Greeks is told in broad strokes and at considerable length. But with one exception it wisely focuses upon common folk rather than prominent figures and makes a sincere effort to address some of the complex currents and vexing issues that faced the men who decided to take up arms against the British. Commercial prospects look solid if not stellar; Mel Gibsons involvement a big promo push and strong action elements will probably not be enough to overcome a resistance to the material by a certain percentage of the public. Corny and melodramatic as it is ""The Patriot"" still manages to do something few films have done -- to tell a story of the American Revolutionary War that has some emotional pull and isnt stuffy and dull. German helmer Roland Emmerichs take on the struggle to form the first true democracy since the ancient Greeks is told in broad strokes and at considerable length. But with one exception it wisely focuses upon common folk rather than prominent figures and makes a sincere effort to address some of the complex currents and vexing issues that faced the men who decided to take up arms against the British. Commercial prospects look solid if not stellar; Mel Gibsons involvement a big promo push and strong action elements will probably not be enough to overcome a resistance to the material by a certain percentage of the public. It remains one of the mysteries of the American cinema why the incredibly dramatic and complex birth of the nation has provided such infertile ground for motion pictures. It may have something to do with the way the founding fathers have been deified by schoolbooks to the point where theyve ceased being flesh and blood or with the events historical distance or with the cumbersome trappings of quill pens muzzle loaders wigs and the like. Still there isnt a single self-evident reason why Hollywood has always shied away from the subject. But with the exception D.W. Griffiths 1924 silent ""America"" the films set in the colonies 225 years ago rep a meager and artistically mediocre lot with the last two Hugh Hudsons 1985 ""Revolution"" and James Ivorys 1995 ""Jefferson in Paris"" setting back the cause even further. Ambitious screenplay by Robert Rodat (""Saving Private Ryan"") unmistakably brands itself as a product of its era with its very Baby Boomerish fetishism about family; children and the family unit were certainly sacrosanct in the old Hollywood but in historical films of no previous period did characters fuss as sentimentally about the well-being of young uns as theyre doing now (see ""Gladiator""). All the same Benjamin Martin (Gibson) has a good excuse as hes both father and mother to a brood of seven now that his wife has passed away. Poetically seen unsuccessfully trying to fashion a rocking chair from which he can watch his kids grow on his South Carolina plantation Benjamin is a former warrior and hero of French and Indian War whos seen too much blood and is now a dedicated pacifist. But the times dont easily accommodate such a position. Its 1776 eight of the 13 American colonies have decided to back the rebellion provoked by King Georges ""taxation without representation"" policy and a Declaration of Independence is expected to be issued shortly from Philadelphia. Now the assembly at Charleston must decide what it will do and when it finally joins the fight Benjamin cannot prevent his headstrong oldest son Gabriel (Heath Ledger) from signing up. ""Hes as impudent as his father was at his age"" a friend helpfully reminds Benjamin. Lord Gen. Cornwallis (Tom Wilkinson) supreme commander of the British forces  soon takes Charleston and a stunned and wounded Gabriel stumbles home. In one of the films most haunting scenes the family watches from their windows as a battle suddenly materializes at night on their property. Diplomatically treating the British wounded the next day Benjamins family is changed forever by the shocking behavior of the arriving Col. Tavington (Jason Isaacs) leader of the Green Dragoons who instantly arrests Gabriel and commits a gratuitous act of violence against Benjamins family. This event at the films half-hour point naturally re-ignites the warrior in Benjamin and we see the primal nature of guerrilla warfare (which Benjamin learned as a young man) as he and two of his sons dash through the woods to ambush the small convoy escorting Gabriel to his date with the hangman. This tense sequence in which young boys shoot soldiers and Benjamin butchers others with a tomahawk is startling in its devastating brutality as well as an indication of the strategy that will help the ragtag colonists turns the tide against their superbly trained but tactically outmoded opponents. After depositing the kids in Charleston with their Aunt Charlotte (Joely Richardson) Benjamin is made a colonel in the South Carolina militia by an old comrade-in-arms (Chris Cooper) and settles in the for long haul against the Brits. The militias general aim is to keep Cornwallis busy in the South so he cant sweep north to New York. To this end Benjamin recruits many of his cohorts from previous battles who like himself have since settled down. One of the merits of the films scrutiny of family is the kaleidoscopic picture it provides of how the war fractured and tore apart all families since it was not a conflict fought just by professional soldiers but by the populace at large. Among the British Benjamin develops a reputation as ""The Ghost"" for his lightning attacks one of which yields Cornwallis personal journals and another of which affords the general a view of a cargo ship full of arms being blown up for the edification of his guests during a garden party. It doesnt all go the colonists way however; in a dazzling ambush most of Benjamins men are killed or wounded. On the pretext of a prisoner exchange Benjamin is permitted to meet with the formal increasingly exasperated Cornwallis in a scene designed to illustrate the full extent of the heros trumpeted impudence. Enraged at being tricked the English military leader gives free reign to Tavington to deal with ""The Ghost"" and his rebels as he sees fit and the colonels previous scorched-earth tactics soon seem mild in comparison to the terror he unleashes on common citizens. Of course it all comes down to a face-off between the mortal enemies Benjamin and Tavington but against the spectacular backdrop of a decisive battle in which the disrespect that Cornwallis has exhibited for the militia comes back to haunt him. Overall ""The Patriot"" gives a plausible indication of the dynamics of the Revolutionary War in political military and personal terms; it is easy to object that enormously complicated events have been unduly simplified into black-and-white good-and-evil oppositions but setting them down in a way that general audiences can grasp is arguably no small achievement. One symptom of the films tendency to put things in obvious terms is having the colonists speak in very middle-of-the-road ""Americun"" accents so as to differentiate them easily from their British enemies; theres no vocal acknowledgment of the conventional Southern accent or of the fact that many colonists at the time were first- or second-generation English who would not have entirely changed their linguistic ways. At the same time Emmerich and Rodat pay attention to historical details and dramatic grace notes that enrich the pictures fabric. Of special interest is the portrait of blacks within the context of a story played out by white principals. Making the blacks working on Benjamins plantation ""employees"" rather than slaves does make the hero a nicer guy but it is a historical wrinkle amplified by one character who joins the militia and sticks with it due to Gen. Washingtons edict that black men who put in a years service will be ensured free status and be paid for each month of duty. Pics most relaxed interlude takes place at a small black community on the beach where the colonists seek refuge for a while and Gabriel is married to a spirited young lady (an earlier scene between them makes amusing use of the old tradition of bundling). Gallic influence among the Brit-fighters is repped by a French officer (Tcheky Karyo) who helps teach guerrilla fighting methods and keeps reminding that a French fleet is on its way to lend a hand. The gruesomeness of musket-to-musket face-to-face combat between regimented lines of soldiers is vividly conveyed (rather too vividly in a couple of over-the-top shots that show the effect a cannonball can have on a human body) in massive battle scenes that contrast nicely with the smaller skirmishes that dot the proceedings. Pics scale is weighty but not heavy and the accessories of the period dont bog things down; the actors move easily and naturally and the varied locations look lived-in. Gibson (a man with seven kids himself we cant forget) forcefully socks over the two prime components of his role the deeply caring dad who would just like to watch his children grow up in peace and the vengeful crafty warrior capable of great brutality. Aussie thesp Ledger (the handsome romantic lead in last years ""10 Things I Hate About You"") makes an entirely believable son for such a father cutting a dashing figure with style and seriousness. Isaacs stakes a claim as a legitimate heir to the Alan Rickman/Jeremy Irons tradition of ruthless British villainy as the endlessly evil Tavington while Wilkinson adroitly creates a satisfyingly complex portrait of the tragically deluded aristocrat Cornwallis. Production values for the South Carolina-shot epic are tops with particular nods to Kirk M. Petruccellis production design Deborah L. Scotts costumes and Caleb Deschanels lustrous lensing. John Williams score is effective if insistent.
