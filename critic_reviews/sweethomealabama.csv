More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

It gets one of its most severe tests yet with Sweet Home Alabama a movie in which the star of Legally Blonde struggles to make audiences give a hoot if her character can pull off a way to become legally wed. She plays a budding superstar fashion designer who is set to marry the New York mayors son (Patrick Dempsey) -- if that is she can get rid of her unpolished hometown husband (Josh Lucas) with whom shes broken off contact. Media outlets trumpet her as the ""Fashion Princess"" and they must be slipping if they havent even looked into her past. More on Alabama Sweet Home Alabama (out of four) Stars Reese Witherspoon Patrick Dempsey Candice Bergen Josh Lucas Director Andy Tennant Distributor Disneys Touchstone Pictures Rating PG-13 for language/sexual references Speaking of credibility Witherspoon seems to be getting along famously with her parents (Fred Ward Mary Kay Place) even though its been seven years since she has been back to hometown Pigeons Creek. (What she couldnt tap into her presumably ample salary to buy an airline ticket to visit her mother?) Matter of fact she doesnt seem to get along with Lucas all that badly either in a town Witherspoon keeps mocking even though it seems fun. The food isnt bad theres always a place to dance (at the watering hole or a street hoedown) and the locals contemplate the meaning of life while drinking beer atop the water tower. Candice Bergen plays Dempseys mother as someone you probably wouldnt expect to be too comfortable in the mayors box at Yankee Stadium. She browbeats her son struggles to pretend that she can tolerate her future daughter-in-laws folks and when the going gets super-tough exhibits a nasty streak that doesnt exactly fit with the current image of nicer more sensitive New Yorkers. Of all the players Bergen is the one who most has to carry her scenes on her shoulders without any help from the writing. Sweet Home Alabama is the latest picture to give you the sense that Hollywood filmmakers simply plucked another old pop-tune title ripe for ripping off then were shaken by the rude reality of coming up with a script to jerry-build around it. Do you remember 1990s Taking Care of Business or 1981s The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia? Right -- we thought so.

Starring Reese Witherspoon Josh Lucas Patrick Dempsey. Directed by Andy Tennant. Written by Douglas J. Eboch and C. Jay Cox. (VHS and DVD. PG-13. 102 minutes.) Theres a certain formulaic and familiar quality about ""Sweet Home Alabama "" but it doesnt matter. This is a film that uses traditional screenwriting touches (like characters from antithetical social classes falling in love) to great effect mining the material for laughs awkward moments and a sweet revelry that is endearing and infectious. Melanie Carmichael (Reese Witherspoon) is an up-and-coming New York fashion designer who gets engaged to a man (Patrick Dempsey) who is rich successful and looks like John F. Kennedy Jr. Her fiances mom (Candice Bergen) is the mayor of New York. It all seems dreamy until Melanie returns to her hometown in Alabama to complete the divorce that will let her marry into this elite Manhattan family. Melanies soon-to-be ex-husband (Josh Lucas) has ideas of his own. A redneck whos still in love with the small-town woman hes known since childhood he stalls for time so he can persuade her to stay in his life. He also acts as a catalyst for old memories including brushes with the law that Melanie hid from her fiance. PAST VERSUS PRESENT Witherspoons character is torn by this tug between the past and the present. Compared with her life in Manhattan her parents (whom she hasnt seen in years) seem like hicks and her old friends seem uneducated and tied down -- yet theres something real about their manners and manias (like re- enacting Civil War battles) and she realizes that theres something sweet about her soon-to-be ex. ""Sweet Home Alabama"" is an inspired at times hilarious love story that seldom loses its way as we see Melanie struggle to choose between the two men who covet her. The worst you can say about ""Sweet Home Alabama"" is that in some spots its predictable and almost too polished. Do the men in Melanies life have to be that handsome? Do Southerners really call people from New York and the Northern states ""Yankees?"" Would Lucas character really snap ""Just cause I talk slow doesnt mean Im stupid?"" Regardless Lucas says his lines with flair as does most of the cast in ""Sweet Home Alabama."" Witherspoon -- for those whove not seen her in ""Election"" and ""Legally Blonde"" -- shows shes a viable actress who can stretch into a role and do funny sad and sassy and play a flawed character who has a habit of lying and isnt picture perfect. There are other pleasant surprises in ""Sweet Home Alabama"" including Nathan Lee Graham who plays a gay fashion designer who is friends with Melanie and who accompanies her to the South for a big event. His characters potential relationship with a gay friend of Melanies in Alabama is one of the little subplots that keep the movie ""Sweet Home Alabama"" on its toes and keep the audience guessing. INTELLIGENT USE OF SONG Thankfully director Andy Tennant avoided the trap of emphasizing the hit 70s song that was popularized by Lynyrd Skynyrd. The tune ""Sweet Home Alabama"" is featured in this movie -- as when Melanie attends an outdoor dance and a band named Cornbread covers Skynyrds the hit -- but thats about it. The song (""Sweet home Alabama where the skies are so blue/ Sweet home Alabama/ Lord Im coming home to you"") could be a kind of anthem for the movie but it would have been really trite to bookend every scene with it or to have the films Alabama characters sing it in their cars. In the end Witherspoons character sings a happy tune. Thats not giving anything away. The movies advertising tag line (""Sometimes what youre looking for is right where you left it"") practically invites you to make that assumption. This is a feel-good movie that actually makes you feel good.

Jay Cox; Release Date Wide 09/27/2002; Runtime (in minutes) 105; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Touchstone Pictures Posted September 25 2002 -- 1200 AM EDT ""Fetching Reese Witherspoon look-alike enjoys big-city cocktail parties and piggyback rides on the beach. Is comfortable in black Armani and old jeans can charm blue bloods and rednecks. Seeks the opposite of whatever she has whenever she has it. Is worth the trouble. Really she is."" Ah life is a well of contradictions as deep as a personals ad for Melanie Carmichael played by the actual fetching Witherspoon in the shallow romantic comedy Sweet Home Alabama. ""Mel"" is a fiery Southern rebel who scampers out on her poor-boy high school-era husband Jake (Josh Lucas) conquers fancy-pants New York City as a fashion designer and snags Andrew her wealthy dishy Big Apple fiance (Patrick Dempsey) who happens to be the son of the mayor (Candice Bergen). Mels urban life is a whirlwind of womens-fiction fantasies - the media success the princely marriage proposal in the jewel-box aisles of Tiffanys the best friends who are (1) black and gay and (2) British. But when she scoots back to Alabama to obtain a little ol divorce once and for all from dirty down-home Jake (her childhood sweetheart her soul mate and hes kee-yoot when he cleans up) the lady finds herself attracted once again to the real-folks comforts of the Southern barefoot life - as opposed to the pretentious Northern kingdom of Manolo Blahniks. Stereotyped and pandering in a mealy Hollywood way to dingbat notions of New York City power-brokering and Deep South bubbahood? You bet darlin. As Andrews meddling mother Bergen armored in the same exaggerated snootiness she brought to ""Miss Congeniality"" is perhaps no more a figure of faintly unpleasant derision than Mary Kay Place as Melanies kitsch-loving mama among the pickle jars. (Melanies taciturn papa played by Fred Ward is devoted to his busted easy chair and to elaborate Civil War reenactments the movie isnt sure whether to honor or parody.) But as calibrated by director Andy Tennant (""Ever After"") from a story by Douglas J. Eboch and script by C. Jay Cox the advantage goes to the good people of Not the Big City who may not trust ambition but who value good friends and a good local juke joint. Apparently if youve got to have money (and Jake turns out not to be quite the shlub Melanie thinks he is) the least objectionable way to throw it around is to buy rounds for your buddies. All of which would make ""Sweet Home Alabama"" unbearable were Witherspoon not such a genuinely attractive performer. Pinning her easy roll-with-the-punches performance between gestures of city elegance and those of country spunk the Nashville-born actress manages from time to time to give Melanie (and by extension her two handsome admirers) a dignity and autonomy the script itself doesnt know what to do with. While the movie stomps and hollers otherwise this mature young star quietly declares that fiddle-dee-dee either Mister Right is fine and hardly worth fighting a war over.

As predictable as the menu for a Southern picnic and not nearly as tasty ""Sweet Home Alabama"" revives the format but not the fun of classic Hollywood screwball comedies about rediscovering the virtues of a former mate. Promising charm with a heaping side portion of down-home warmth but delivering nouvelle portions of both overly eager-to-please pic is as formulaic as any sitcom and is the first film to feature rising star Reese Witherspoon in an unintentionally unflattering light. Romantic fantasy angle of a young woman faced with a choice between two appealing guys will lure a substantial femme audience although even the most favorably predisposed viewers wont get as many laughs and heart-tugs as they might expect. The ""comedy of remarriage"" subgenre included some of the old studio eras most wonderful pictures notably ""The Awful Truth"" and ""His Girl Friday"" but the only time ""Sweet Home Alabama"" will be mentioned in the same breath with these standard-bearers will be as a means of illustrating the new films many deficiencies. First-time screenwriter C. Jay Cox working from a story by Douglas J. Eboch not only buys into the most elementary cliches of traditional Hollywood storytelling and characterization but also forwards as the films operating principle the fresh idea that Big City=Bad Small Town=Good. Unfortunately director Andy Tennant underlines the yarns bland obviousness as if with a marking pen without adding the sort of texture or malicious twists that might have provided the film with a trace of personality. After watching the first 20 minutes almost anyone of appropriate age to see a PG-13-rated picture would be able to map out how the rest of the tale will unfold and many of them would no doubt see the wisdom of getting it told about 15 minutes faster than it is here. Witherspoon plays Melanie Carmichael who by her mid-20s has emerged as one of the glittering new designers on the New York fashion scene. And now after seven years in Gotham shes also managed to snare the citys most eligible bachelor the handsome and impossibly smooth Andrew (Patrick Dempsey). Because hes wealthy and his mom (Candice Bergen) just happens to be mayor Andrew is able to stage a marriage proposal so extravagantly romantic -- set after-hours in the main showroom of Tiffanys with a selection of engagement rings at hand -- that a girl could hardly say no. But one rightly suspects that theres trouble in store when Melanie returns to Pigeon Creek Ala. ostensibly to see her parents for the first time since she left to conquer the Big Apple. With the same bossy dander she might lay on a sloppy garment worker Melanie stomps into the home occupied by the skeleton in her closet -- a good-lookin but laid-back country boy named Jake (Josh Lucas) her long-abandoned husband -- and demands an instant divorce so she can marry Andrew. Melanie whose real last name is Smooter and Jake are like cat and dog; it only takes minutes for her to call him a ""dumb stubborn redneck hick"" and for him to brand her a ""hoity-toity stuck-up Yankee bitch."" Unfortunately the latter comes very close to the truth as all the adorableness that Witherspoon has exhibited thus far in her career here takes on a certain hard abrasive quality never visible before; the strain of trying to carry a picture single-handedly shows as it did not in last summers hit ""Legally Blonde."" That Melanie is therefore not a particularly sympathetic character -- she scarcely seems pleased to see her ultra-Southern parents (Fred Ward and Mary Kay Place) after all these years -- cuts against much rooting interest in this loud pushy young woman who most people might rightly feel needs a comeuppance rather than her choice of primo males. While impatiently waiting for Jake to sign on the dotted line Melanie makes the rounds catching up with old acquaintances finally earning everyones ill-will by insulting all the rubes on a drunken evening at a bar and insisting upon her own newfound superiority. Some lame comedy ensues when a snoopy New York Post reporter arrives to dig up any dirt he can on the country girl due to marry into East Coast aristocracy while Bergens snobbish mayor elicits a couple of laughs with her single-minded political assessment of every situation ""As a Democrat I get elected by poor people"" she rationalizes when faced with the prospect of an Alabama wedding for her son. Through it all its clear that Jake has never stopped carrying the torch for his first love but it takes rather longer in screen time than necessary for Melanie to remember why she married the scruffy but affably unpretentious Jake. Critically the key moments that are meant to reconnect the couple dont carry the needed undercurrent of irresistible desire so the big denouement -- set like a 30s romantic comedy at a giant outdoor wedding -- lacks the required emotional investment not to mention a convincing payoff. Reminding of Matthew McConaughey and a younger Kevin Costner by turns Lucas delivers an easy-going turn that should fill the bill for the intended audience while Dempseys rich boy is too uncomplicatedly ""nice"" to be believed. Ultra-reliable thesps Place and Jean Smart have their Southern shtick down cold while the full comic potential of Wards dad an unrepentant old Confederate with a penchant for participating in Civil War battle reenactments remains far from fulfilled; one can only imagine the field day Preston Sturges and William Demerest might have had with such a character. Indicative of the pics intensely pre-programmed quality is the musical score which functions very much like a sitcom laugh track in cueing audience response.
