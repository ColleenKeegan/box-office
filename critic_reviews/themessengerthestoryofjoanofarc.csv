That aside theres precious little in Luc Bessons solemnly inflated battle-weary historical epic The Messenger The Story of Joan of Arc that inspires much surprise. Its a cast-of-thousands movie in the doggiest most literal-minded sense With all of those extras lancing and thwacking away the viewer strains to feel much of a connection to any of them. As Joan the indefatigable teenage saint who in the early 1400s leads the French army in a crusade against the invading English Milla Jovovich isnt terrible exactly. Plucky and defiant with a flop of sun-washed blond hair that still looks like next seasons fashion-runway revolt she wields a broadsword with confidence and she keeps her tulip-soft features proudly alert. Her warrior-jock Joan certainly holds the eye but whenever Jovovich speaks she sounds singsongy and flip--depressingly un-mythic. She has dynamism of a sort but no ferocity no agony-and-ecstasy fire. ""I dont think"" says Joan. ""I leave that to God."" Jovovich seems to have left her acting to God too. As a character Joan of Arc has defeated many an actress and thats because shes a nearly unfathomable contradiction of innocence and vengeance masochism and valor youth and timelessness. In The Messenger we meet her as an ethereal 8-year-old (radiantly played by Jane Valentine) abused and abandoned hallucinating her mission as a holy savior. By the time she grows up into a strapping pouty beauty her presence has been all but swallowed by the battering tumult of medieval warfare. Theres a token of castle intrigue John Malkovich as the opportunistic French dauphin who is waiting to be crowned delights a bit too obviously in being John Malkovich and Faye Dunaway as his scheming mother-in-law looks and acts like a scary wax-museum version of her former self. Mostly though the film lays on the stolid combat flaming arrows men storming castles on rickety ladders catapults shooting boulders. (There are only so many ways to photograph a catapult.) Besson has always been a bit of a hack but he worked with zappier personality and flair in The Professional and The Fifth Element than he does in this pious super-square action dud. By the time Hoffman shows up sounding like he was beamed in from a much later century we realize that Joan has no one left to talk to but her inner self and that it would be hard to imagine a martyrdom more weightless than Milla Jovovich going to the stake for faith.

Nobody plays angry like Ben Foster but compassion is something new for the actor who softens his crazy-man shtick to deliver a complex and moving performance in ""The Messenger."" Foster plays an Iraq War hero assigned to work for the Casualty Notification Office -- those uniformed bearers of bad news who show up on the doorsteps of parents and wives with word of a soldiers death. Director Oren Movermans devastating debut confuses its message somewhat by allowing the officer to fall for one of the widows (Samantha Morton) a development however that should boost commercial prospects for this potent character study. Joining such recent Iraq War films as ""Grace Is Gone"" and ""The Lucky Ones"" in addressing combats toll on the homefront ""The Messenger"" manages to be both practical and patriotic in the same breath zeroing in on one of the most painful aspects of wartime. Staff Sgt. Will Montgomery (Foster ""30 Days of Night"") was wounded in Iraq taking shrapnel to the leg and face. With only three months of service left on his enlistment he is reassigned to casualty notification arguably the Armys least comfortable job. The movie sets up a fertile dynamic between the rebellious young man and his seasoned commanding officer Capt. Tony Stone (Woody Harrelson) a recovering alcoholic who has developed the nerves for their task. Montgomery is too weak at first identifying too strongly with the grieving families to be the stone-faced messenger the job requires. After all Montgomery is still working through his own issues He came home to find his ex-girlfriend (Jena Malone) engaged to someone else and he carries his post-traumatic stress just beneath the surface -- a stunning use of the actors innate volatility. But as the relationship between Montgomery and Stone matures we come to realize that Montgomery may actually be the soldier better suited to express the Armys condolences to complete strangers. The task certainly helps him cope with his own demons -- Foster takes responsibility for a comrades death and wrestles daily with the guilt of his own survival in ways that are suggested but not directly articulated until late in the movie. Though much of the film focuses on their off hours the episodes of the two officers at work prove challenging. Such scenes of sudden grief are familiar to most auds (the mother collapsing in her doorway in ""Saving Private Ryan"") but ""The Messenger"" views the exchange from the p.o.v. of the men tasked with breaking the news. Montgomery has a difficult time standing by during these encounters (featuring strong brief appearances by actors such as Steve Buscemi) -- and in the case of Mortons Army wife he goes back to check up on her an admirable sensitivity complicated by a highly inappropriate sexual attraction. To offset the sheer tragedy Moverman and co-writer Alessandro Camon inject a fair amount of humor into the film. Stones casual jocularity is a way of coping with so much loss and over time Harrelson slowly lets the audience in on the true fragility of his character. But the narrative loses focus late in the second act with the two officers going off on a wild bender and crystallizes once again in a powerful confessional between the two men toward the end of the movie. Camerawork and tech credits are polished and ready for release.

Starring Milla Jovovich John Malkovich Faye Dunaway and Dustin Hoffman. Directed by Luc Besson. Written by Andrew Birkin and Luc Besson. (R. 141 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It doesnt take long to see what Luc Besson was up to when he made ""The Messenger The Story of Joan of Arc."" Besson the French director of ""The Fifth Element"" wanted to make Joan of Arc a hip chick a riot grrrl a blaze of fabulousness across the millennial divide. ""The Messenger"" which opens today isnt some sober history lesson that bogs down in long speeches and tedious facts. Its about style its about fashion its about rock n roll busting out in medieval France. With that in mind Besson cast Milla Jovovich an actress who looks just like supermodel Linda Evangelista. I think this was intentional One look at Jovovich in her cool 15th century drag and the viewer is bound to visualize chain metal and bloodstained burlap on the Paris runways. Jovovich (""The Fifth Element"") gives her all to Joan the illiterate French peasant who heard voices and led France in battle against the English. Ingrid Bergman Jean Seberg and a silent film actress named Maria Falconetti all played Joan of Arc before but none with the cajones of Jovovich. I mean she doesnt just act. She growls she rides a horse she dives into battle. She rocks. In one scene Jovovich climbs a ladder gets shot in the back with an arrow and falls backward about 12 feet into the arms of her fellow soldiers. Take that Gwyneth Paltrow. In the early scenes the 8-year-old Joan played by Jane Valentine gets to run through fields of red poppies and lavender and open her arms wide like Julie Andrews in ""The Sound of Music."" Its just like those moments in a Disney animated feature when Pocahontas or Belle or whoever skips through the village and sings about her hopes and dreams -- only this time its live action and shes in natural-fiber fabrics dyed ecru and beige. Besson likes close-ups lots of em and keeps his movie poppin with loud music and high-energy battle scenes that dont spare the blood and severed limbs. Jovovich is right in there yelling ""To the drawbridge"" in a vein-popping battle cry or ""I am the drum on which God beats his message"" This movie knows its audience -- everyone who loved ""Scream"" -- and doesnt want to lose us with a lot of talk and mood setting. And just so Boomers wont feel left out Besson stuck prestige actors like John Malkovich and Faye Dunaway in supporting roles. Malkovich plays Charles VII like some fey hairdresser and Dunaway all cheekbones and lips plays his mother-in-law Yolande DAragon as if she were running a multinational cosmetics firm. Dustin Hoffman is even more weird. He plays Joan of Arcs ""conscience"" which means he wears a dark shroud whispers a lot and probably got more money per screen minute than anybody since Marlon Brando went blond for ""Superman."" ..
