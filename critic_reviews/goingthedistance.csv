Barrymores Erin is a would-be journo who meets Longs Garrett during an internship in New York. After she returns to Chicago they decide to try a long-distance relationship. Whats both refreshing and problematic is that theres no emotional imbalance between boy and girl their feelings are mutual and the obstacle is purely geographical. Their chemistry and mischievous banter are fun but the story offers little tension and eventually becomes repetitive. Luckily the characters have bags of charm both work hard play hard and give as good as they get. The night they meet Garretts flatmate plays 80s love songs through the wall as a soundtrack to their hook-up. Erin feigns offence but thinks its hilarious. The scene is set for a fun-loving courtship with amusing sidekicks Christina Applegate is good as Erins sister while Jason Sudeikis is great as Dans brash mate. It may tire before the finish line but Going the Distance is still good for a giggle.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 03 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Going the Distance Directed by Nanette Burstein Written by Geoff LaTulippe Starring Drew Barrymore and Justin Long Classification 14A A Field Guide to Making a Generic Hollywood Rom-com or in this particularly forgettable case Going the Distance with Going the Distance. The Script You really dont need one so dont sweat it. Sure some token obeisance must be paid to the structure of every rom-com ever committed to the big screen - that is bring the lovers together create an impediment to romance then have them surmount the obstacle. How token? Just consider the sterling example here. One lover lives in New York the other in San Francisco. Impediment distance. Solution eliminate distance. Eureka a script. The Casting Any face will do as long as its familiar and always err on the side of excessive familiarity. Which makes Drew Barrymore perfect - her face has been around since its child-star days. Now some might quibble that at 35 shes past her best-by date for playing an eager intern trying to break into the job market. Happily the field guide is absolute on this sort of casting issue Anyone troubled by such niggling concerns has no business making a generic Hollywood rom-com. And the familiar guy to play opposite our familiar gal? Well he already shared a credit with Drew in Hes Just Not That Into You. And folks love him from all those cute Mac-versus-PC commercials. You know that Justin Long fellow. The Setting Cities are a good choice with New York and San Francisco ranking high on any list. But feel no compunction to actually capture the city on camera. Instead to save trouble and expense shoot mainly interiors - stock-issue bars apartments offices - thereby putting the generic into your generic rom-com. Consequently although the non-existent plot should be set in the present the formulaic sameness in look and design will give your movie that timelessly bland aura. It could be anywhere at any time because it has been everywhere at every time. The Filler This is where you earn your paycheque. In the virtual absence of a script filler and padding and other assorted time-wasting techniques are essential. To help in this crucial endeavour surround the stars with a bunch of second bananas maybe Christina Applegate and Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day. Sorry to be sexist but recruit the guys for toilet-humour duty a perennial favourite. In this instance Sudeikis can be seen enjoying a bowel movement while quaffing a beer a triumph of multi-tasking that permits entire minutes to tick off the feature-length clock. That food fight was similarly useful not to mention Justins extended visit to a tanning salon. Remember that all this is the cinematic equivalent of landfill and the audience tends to laugh out of sheer gratitude - without it theyd drown in nothingness. The Language Have every character make extensive use of the f-word as noun adjective and verb. Where possible employ phrases that allow for the rhyming substitution of the f-word phrases like ""bucket list."" Such liberal dropping of the f-bomb will let you boast that the dialogue is edgy and real. As a bonus you will have fewer words to write and the actors fewer to memorize. The Montage Always insert it after the lovers meet and as they are falling headlong into amour. If in the Big Apple schedule one location outing for your montage shot perhaps Coney Island by day or the East Village by night. Tell your stars to smile a lot stick some bouncy tune on the soundtrack and take pride in the knowledge that you are 1) adding to the vast library of New York City visual cliches and 2) wasting even more time. The Director Anyone will do at least anyone with sufficient vocal command to shout ""Action"" and ""Cut"" at a volume audible to the crew. The Reviews Only read the bottom line of the accountants review after your generic masterpiece has gone the distance from theatrical release to video stores to the nethermost regions of the cable dial. If the accountants judgment proves kind head to the bank and feel free to enjoy precisely what youve denied so many others - a really good laugh.

Starring Drew Barrymore Justin Long Christina Applegate Director Nanette Burstein Release Opened Sep 3 2010  Editorial Review Ah modern romanceBy Michael OSullivanFriday September 3 2010""Going the Distance"" is a movie in the tradition of ""American Pie"" and ""Theres Something About Mary."" Its filthy funny and kind of sweet if not quite up to the level of Judd Apatows oeuvre in the burgeoning field of R-rated comedies with heart. You will laugh and blush in equal measure. You will not however read any of its best lines here as they are all unprintable at least in a family newspaper. What I can tell you is this Drew Barrymore and Justin Long make one cute couple. Whether or not the actors on-again-off-again real-life romance helped their performances as lovers frustrated by geography -- hes in Manhattan shes in San Francisco -- its clear they have chemistry. E.T.s girlfriend and the Mac Guy ooze a laid-back goofy charm through their pore-less skin. Theyre a modern-day Hepburn and Grant. This serves them well in the first fictional feature from documentarian Nanette Burstein (""American Teen"") working from a script by fellow newcomer Geoff LaTulippe. Yeah the story is written by a guy -- thats obvious from all the jokes about autoeroticism irrational girlfriend behavior and going to the bathroom with the door open -- but Burstein brings a wise gentle touch to the proceedings. Theres a tenderness that softens even the crudest moments. And the warmth of the stars would smooth over any beginning filmmakers missteps. When record-company flunky Garrett (Long) meets newspaper intern Erin (Barrymore) one summer in New York theres no expectation that the relationship will go anywhere. Hes on the rebound having just broken up with someone that night. And shes about to leave town to return to journalism school on the West Coast. Its just a fling right? Not in the movies. This one is no exception. Cue the marijuana-induced millennial-generation bonding -- OMG ""License to Ill"" is like the awesomest album ever -- followed by a standard-issue falling-in-love montage featuring surf frolicking. Fast-forward to the airport where they suddenly announce that theyre crazy about each other. Crazy is right. Neither makes enough money to visit more frequently than once every few months. So between the occasional rutting-filled holiday weekend they have to resort to phone sex late-night Skype-ing and texting each other every five minutes much to the annoyance of Garretts friends played with deadpan hilarity by ""Saturday Night Lives"" Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day of ""Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia."" Christina Applegate and Jim Gaffigan round out the excellent supporting cast as Erins germophobic big sister and her jaded husband who take in Erin while shes finishing her studies -- and who in one indelible scene catch the two lovebirds having sex on their dining room table. The sight of Longs bare buttocks stamped with his own handprint as the result of a spray-on tanning accident is one I will not soon forget. Such are the conventions of the modern romantic comedy. Get used to it I say or give up on the genre. But maybe not just yet. What is perhaps most surprising about ""Going the Distance"" is not its contemporaneity. Sure its filled with the pot jokes casual hookups and the glorification of prolonged adolescence so common to the Apatovian canon. But in its heart of hearts its as old-fashioned as they come.Contains graphic sexual humor frequent obscenity sensuality brief nudity and drug use.

Jessica Miglio From left Charlie Day Jason Sudekis Justin Long and Drew Barrymore in ""Going the Distance."" Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn they aint but because theyve had a romantic relationship in real life Justin Long and Drew Barrymore have a believable chemistry that makes ""Going the Distance"" worth going to. More or less.Occupying a middle ground between Hollywood convention and indie invention this renovated romantic comedy could be called ""(Six) Weeks of Summer."" Thats the time allotted to record label talent scout Garrett (Long) and aspiring reporter Erin (Barrymore) before the latter leaves Manhattan for grad school in San Francisco. But after 42 days of playfully dating with no strings attached they decide their relationship is serious enough to try sustaining it long distance. That means cutesy-cum-creepy scenes of them texting video-chatting and attempting phone sex to the consternation of Garretts beer-commercial compadres sensitive-but-slovenly Dan (Charlie Day who adds some dimension to a cardboard character) and cougar-seducing Box (Jason Sudeikis who is hard to take). On the western end of the cyberlink Erin bunks with her married sister Corinne (scene-stealer Christina Applegate). Corinne advises her little sis to forget about the New York newspaper gig she covets and to pursue a practical opportunity in California -- particularly after sex-starved Garrett pays a weekend visit and treats the familys dining-room table like a waterbed. In the inevitable crossroads confrontation the surprise is that Garrett is more emotional than Erin. Long is such a likably easygoing actor that his dramatic potential is underrated but in the safe company of his friend Barrymore he effectively trades schtick for sincerity.""Going the Distance"" was directed by documentary veteran Nanette Burstein (""The Kid Stays in the Picture""). While its both too crude and too commercial to be mistaken for journalism the good news is that the headliners deliver. Showtimes for ""Going the Distance"" Sep 2 2010 (...)

(Miglio; Warner Bros.) Joe Neumaier Friday September 3 2010 400 AM Title Going the Distance As movies about displaced sweethearts go ""Going the Distance"" is stuck somewhere between ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and a hard place. But this empty immature romantic comedy ultimately feels as if its filled with all the hot air that separates New York and San Francisco yet still manages to be a suffocating bore.Those two cities are what cause trouble for Erin (Drew Barrymore) and Garrett (Justin Long) only a few weeks after they meet cute in a Manhattan bar. Hes an up-and-coming scout for a record label shes a 31-year-old Stanford University student interning at a newspaper and soon these skittish motormouths are making all of Gotham their playground. As she prepares to return to California they impulsively decide at the airport to update their boyfriend-girlfriend status to long distance and exclusive.Of course thats easier said than done. High airfares keep visits to once every four months phone sex proves unsatisfying they waste Skype-cam time fawning over baby panda videos and there are only so many emoticons that can accompany texts saying ""LUV U""Meanwhile Erins protective sister (an underused Christina Applegate) worries this relationship will distract Erin like an earlier one that resulted in her ""derailed time line."" Nonetheless the two crazy kids try to make it work despite the hurdles.Though anything that begins with the squirrely Long making ridiculous loverman moves has nowhere to go but up ""Going the Distance"" never gains speed. Its also packed with anachronistic references (audio cassettes ""Centipede"" video games countless ""Top Gun"" shout-outs - is the writer sneaking in a pitch for ""The Wedding Singer 2""?) and as this genre now requires a brigade of quirky sidekicks. Most annoying of those is Dan (Charlie Day) Garretts roommate a chattering boy-man who wears wool caps is obsessed with baby pigeons and doesnt close the bathroom door. Apparently Day did research for his role at a hospital for the insane.Barrymore and Long though are more problematic. A real-life on-again/off-again couple when they made this theyre not exactly Hepburn and Tracy. Half-finished sentences and knowing smirks arent the same thing as onscreen chemistry. Erin is a fledging reporter - some scenes were filmed at the Daily News offices - who seems too much a tough-talkin guys gal for the milquetoast played by former iMac spokesdude Long. Itd take much less than time lines and time zones to derail these two.Cross-country? They couldnt even do Brooklyn to the Bronx.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Pictures Review Going the Distance 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Going the Distance Romantic comedy. Starring Drew Barrymore Justin Long and Christina Applegate. Directed by Nanette Burstein. (R. 102 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Romantic comedy is the fruit fly of movie genres usually so caught up in the myths and mores of the moment that even a few years later the behavior seems phony. But a good one is the gift that keeps on giving. Success or failure comes down to whether the filmmakers have the perception to recognize the truth of their own era and the honesty to say it. ""Going the Distance"" does both and its first rate. This new movie with Drew Barrymore and Justin Long recognizes that modern people are pretty coarse that theyre loose profane and cavalier in ways that previous generations werent. It also knows that love and intimacy have the same urgency as ever. And so the film captures the harshness and the sweetness of our time. We know were in good hands from the moment Barrymore and Long (as Erin and Garrett) meet in a New York bar. Nothing weird nothing cute they just hit it off the way people sometimes do. From then on all the formulaic things that weve come to expect and dread in a romantic comedy dont happen. The movie doesnt skip over the part where they get to know each other. And there are no fabricated arguments or ridiculous misunderstandings. You know how in some movies people become estranged and yet if theyd only just talk to each other everything would be OK? Here they talk to each other just like people not like idiots in a romantic comedy. They dont need fake problems. They have something real to deal with which becomes the subject of the story Shes in New York on an internship and when it ends she goes back home to the Bay Area. From then on the two are faced with trying to maintain a relationship across the span of a continent. Its a measure of the success of ""Going the Distance"" that by the time the story kicks in the audience is totally invested in the couple. Theyre smart theyre funny theyre best friends theyre soul mates. We start feeling their longing. Along the way we get a story about love during the recession and the particular challenges faced by young adults in a miserable economy. Erin (Barrymore) and Garrett (Long) are talented people who in their early 30s really should be launched on their careers not mired in perpetual occupational adolescence. They should have enough money to fly across the country without wiping out their savings. They should have enough opportunity to pick where they want to live and get a decent job. The treatment of these issues is seemingly in passing not heavy-handed. Yet its no accident that screenwriter Geoff LaTulippe places the lovers in industries particularly damaged by the new economy journalism and music. She spends her days trying to get hired by newspaper editors whove just laid off 100 people and hes stuck in a business so depressed that it only invests in the safest most insipid product. That lack of money can be the enemy of love is no new idea. But when you see two people struggling who should have the world before them - and would have had a generation go - that old observation lands with new force. But again no sledgehammer; this element tossed is off and all you see in the foreground are just two people talking crudely and feeling deeply using Skype having conversations into the early morning hours doubting and hoping and counting the days. Barrymores fluid ease with comedy is a marvel and both she and Long have a truthfulness in everything they do. ""Going the Distance"" is often quite funny and Christina Applegate has some particularly inspired moments as Barrymores frazzled older sister. Director Nanette Burstein who has previously worked as a documentarian - she made the splendid high school documentary ""American Teen"" - holds the supporting players to a rigorous standard of emotional accuracy. They sell the comedy never oversell it. By the way just for the record a couple of scenes take place at The San Francisco Chronicle but the office as depicted in the film looks more like a train station than the real thing. Also journalists never tell each other ""Hey that was a really nice Page One story you did today"" At best they just sort of grunt ""Eh nice piece"" without looking up from their mail. -- Advisory Sexual situations nudity strong language.

Going the Distance doesnt | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesGoing the Distance doesntStarring Drew Barrymore and ex-boyfriend Justin Long Going the Distance falls short.Justin Long and Drew Barrymore star in Going the Distance.  (HANDOUT)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Sept. 2 2010Going the Distance(out of 4)Starring Drew Barrymore Justin Long Charlie Day Jason Sudeikis and Christina Applegate. Directed by Nanette Burstein. 104 minutes. At major theatres. 14AHey Drew this stars for you.As Erin in Going the Distance the ever-bubbly Barrymore is playing the same loveable loon -- often with a fondness for booze -- that shes been doing since 1995s Boys on the Side. Despite this tendency to repeat like the order of extra-hot wings she ends up wearing on her face in a bar scene Barrymore remains a cinema sweetheart. Although at age 35 this may be her last kick at the cutesy-pie cat.Article Continued BelowOur Drew gets a star for Going the Distance. The other half star is for attempting originality as post-recession comedy despite missing the opportunities to make the most of the situation. This sloppy effort from first-time feature director Nanette Burstein (a talented documentary maker fumbling badly here) is clearly inspired by the Judd Apatow school of gross-out comedy (minus the funny parts). It surfs into theatres Friday on a wave of bad-taste jokes involving defecation semen dry humping self gratification and men being loudly instructed by a woman to suck something that gals dont actually have. Oh yes and then theres the Hitler/gas quips. A laugh riot. The story is simple 31-year-old underachiever Erin working as a New York newspaper intern while finishing her graduate degree in California meets record exec Garrett (at the time Barrymores real-life squeeze and now her ex Mac guy Justin Long).Erin is smarter tougher and can (occasionally) hold her liquor better than any guy in the room. She doesnt do demure which suits wimpy Garrett just fine thereby laying the groundwork for the relationship to come.They make a big show about how they wont get entangled Erin has to head west to go back to journalism school in six weeks. For now she works for a crusty editor whos straight out of Central Casting. He prints out her stories to read and circles mistakes in red pencil. He probably forgot his eyeshade back in his horseless carriage.Helped by a montage of seaside running and football in the park Erin and Garrett fall in love anyway and vow to work out a long-distance relationship. Not such an easy task in the self-absorbed universes they inhabit.Meanwhile Erins harried hausfrau sister (Christina Applegate) and Garretts slacker best pals (Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis) whisper words of sedition in the ears of the parted lovers who are determined to endure being separated with the aid of phone sex and texting. But cracks in their long-distance relationship start to show and widen when Erin and Garrett finally manage to get together. Since they have done little to endear themselves to us it doesnt really matter whether they make up or break up. The only appeal aside from Barrymores charm is the strange voyeurism of watching a real-life couple do some onscreen canoodling. We know Long can be funny -- he all but stole the otherwise unfortunate Zack and Miri Make a Porno as bass-voiced adult star Brandon. Here he plays a thankless second banana role that fails to connect.Going the Distance is a reminder of the sorry state of the rom-com where gross scenes and easy-to-write trash talk have replaced smart dialogue. What we get instead is a movie that covers a lot of ground in theory with its bi-coastal romance yet trips over its own feet.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Pictures In their own little world Dan (Charlie Day left) and Box (Jason Sudeikis) play third and fourth wheel during a romantic ride with Garrett (Justin Long) and Erin (Drew Barrymore). ABOUT THE MOVIEGoing the Distance  (out of four)Stars Drew Barrymore Justin Long Christina Applegate Jason SudeikisDirector Nanette BursteinDistributor Warner Bros.Rating R for sexual content including dialogue language throughout some drug use and brief nudityRunning time 1 hour 36 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY With good chemistry between likable leads and some timely recession-era professional woes Going the Distance should be more of a contender. TRAILER Get a glimpse at Going the Distance But it stops short of the finish line burying its romantic-comedy assets under calculated efforts to be socially relevant and vulgar attempts at humor. The talent is certainly there. Both Justin Long and Drew Barrymore have sharp comic timing and appealingly self-deprecating acting styles. But writer Geoff LaTulippe forgot to give them -- and their surrounding friends and family -- anything interesting or clever to say other than sexual innuendos and quips about bodily functions. Barrymore plays Erin a 31-year-old newspaper intern who meets Garrett a record company employee with a fascination with Top Gun. Their pop-culture references to that film The Shawshank Redemption and Moesha feel dated. After six weeks of fun Erin must leave New York and return to graduate school at Stanford University. This is where their long-distance travails begin. The movie wants to be a serio-comic look at the often competing forces between work and love. Much is made of the couples respective passions for their chosen fields both of which are undergoing massive institutional changes. Perhaps this is where director Nanette Bursteins background making such documentary films as 2008s American Teen and 1999s On the Ropes bleeds through. Neither is in the position careerwise to make compromises for the sake of their romance. This premise with better writing could have made a much more compelling movie. As it is this uneven movie is more a compilation of contemporary images and concerns peppered with derivative raucous scenarios a la Judd Apatow movies than an involving romantic comedy. There are the formulaic montages -- lots of scenes of Barrymore and Long making out all over Manhattan -- and predictable moments like getting high amid giggles and prattling on about their favorite movies. When Long goes to the tanning booth its hard to keep from groaning given how many rom-coms feel the need to insert a tanning casualty scene. Long in goofy shower cap gamely manages to make this sequence funnier than previous on-screen tanning debacles. In his first romantic lead Long gets the most laughs his pleasantly offhand and quick wit coming off in an almost improvisational style. He and Barrymore are both convincing as best friends who fall in love. They needed a better playing field.

Even on film.  |  1/2 out of 4 stars By Tom Horgen Star Tribune September 2 2010 -- 224pm Warner Bros. Drew Barrymore and Justin Long in ""Going the Distance"" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Judd Apatow has shown us that relationship comedies -- which is a highfalutin way of saying romantic comedies -- can be a place for both thoughtful love stories and toilet-bowl humor. ""Going the Distance"" is a foul-mouthed rom-com carved from Apatowian intent but it feels more like a sketch of a movie than the real thing. Drew Barrymore is her congenial self as Erin a 31-year-old newspaper intern in New York whos fallen for Justin Longs geek-stud Garrett. The two tumble into a whirlwind romance right before Erin is set to move back to San Francisco. Thus a predicament for the ages Can their love survive a cross-country relationship? (Oh my.) Right out of the gate director Nanette Burstein unleashes a full arsenal of rom-com cliches including the obligatory falling-in-love montage. Cue beach scene Coney Island scene frolicking in Central Park scene. Ugh. This is not to say ""Going the Distance"" totally slips into genre purgatory. The film has filled smaller roles with an assembly of notable comedians. Charlie Day (""Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia"") and Jason Sudeikis (""Saturday Night Live"") play Garretts perpetual-bachelor buddies. They inhabit hilarious scenes where the duo ruminate about nothing at all. Day a short guy with a scratchy voice continually asks ""Why do you never see baby pigeons in New York?"" (Good question.) These moments -- which often lead down the path of poop and masturbation jokes -- feel like theyve been parachuted in from some other movie. But their cleverness actually gives ""Going the Distance"" an edginess it would otherwise lack. GOING THE DISTANCE  1/2 out of 4 stars. Rated R for sexual content including dialogue language throughout some drug use and brief nudity. In fact Apatows influence is felt right down to the design of some of the films key characters. In ""Knocked Up"" Leslie Mann played Katherine Heigls disapproving older sister. She is basically Xeroxed here with Christina Applegate providing a wagging finger to Barrymores bad choices. Like Mann Applegate relishes the role but its surprisingly familiar. ""Going the Distance"" tries its hardest to blend Apatows bromance humor with the rom-coms sappy conventionalism. The result is a goulash that just doesnt taste right.

What they dont have much of is history or geography. Within weeks after they meet in a scruffy Manhattan tavern Erin must return to San Francisco for graduate school.Barrymore is impish and Long droll in the affable comedy Going the Distance about lovers divided by 3000 miles and almost as many other obstacles. While the leads (once real-life partners) are a delight Nanette Bursteins movie about a couple trying to synchronize careers love and geography is a little less so.The film gets many things so right about the conflicts faced by a two-career couple looking for work in a shrinking economy. (In this case a couple whose careers are in fields plagued by layoffs.)Likewise the R-rated screenplay has the casual raunch and relationship slapstick of a dating world where the line between hookup and coupledom is fuzzy.But theres a ""havent-we-met-before?"" quality to the secondary characters that diminishes Goings wry observational humor of the principals.The films fresh perspectives come in the familiar and shelf-worn wrapping of a Judd Apatow comedy. Garrett has best friends (Charlie Day Jason Sudeikis) who are the comic Greek chorus to the happenings in his life. And Erin has a high-strung sister (nicely played by Christina Applegate as a woman phobic of bodily fluids) who disapproves of Garrett.More interesting than these forces threatening to come between the lovebirds are the forces that really do come between them distance insecurity jealousy and the fear that if one gives up a job to come live with the other the relationship may not survive.Sadly Erin and Garrett live in a world where jobs are safer bets than partners. Both are inclined to go where the job is rather than where the heart is a point sometimes lost in the shuffle of the comic Greek chorus.Working from a script by Geoff LaTulippe Burstein (American Teen) is sharp at showing how the technological devices designed to bring people together (cell phones the Internet iChat) end up distancing them.The movie avoids most of the romantic comedy cliches and its leads are appealing. Thats almost enough for me. But not quite.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

"Drew Barrymore and Justin Long as slackers in long-distance love in Going the Distance. Slate Sign In Sign Up Drew Barrymore and Justin Long as slackers in long-distance love in Going the Distance. Drew Barrymore and Justin Long as slackers in long-distance love in Going the Distance. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 2 2010 517 PM Im a Mac and I Was in E.T. Justin Long and Drew Barrymore in Going the Distance. By Dana Stevens Going the Distance Going the Distance (Paramount) is a pleasant floppy romantic comedy thats hard to hate--the lead couple played by Justin Long and Drew Barrymore are too game and appealing to inspire much snark--but also hard to love. Theres just not quite enough to the movie not enough jokes not enough obstacles not enough sex. (Though theres plenty of talk about sex. Perhaps in an attempt to break down the wall between Apatow man-comedy and gooey chick flicks the script by Geoff LaTulippe keeps up a steady flow of profanity.) Still Ill give Going the Distance a pleasant floppy stamp of approval. At least unlike many recent romantic comedies (do I really have to name them? The Ugly Truth All About Steve The Proposal et boring cetera) this film doesnt center around two mean shallow jerks who communicate only in some sort of rigidly gendered mating code. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Journalism student Erin (Barrymore) and record-label flack Garrett (Long) meet under realistically un-cute circumstances At the end of a lousy day (he got dumped by his girlfriend; she realized her internship at a New York newspaper was leading nowhere) they go out get hammered at a bar and wind up at Garretts place smoking pot and having sex. I liked that the movie presents these characters fondness for partying not as wild debauchery but as matter-of-fact part of a certain young-adult lifestyle. Garrett and Erin arent pie-eyed kids; theyre in their early 30s old enough to have lived through painful past relationships and to chafe at the limitations of their less-than-fulfilling jobs. So even when they have a six-week affair thats so romantic its scored to the Cures ""Just Like Heaven"" they dont necessarily assume theyll stay together when Erins internship ends and she returns to her hometown of San Francisco. But as Erins about to board her plane home Garrett sprints after her (romantic comedy screenwriters please post this near your keyboards No more running through airports until the year 2050) and proposes a long-distance arrangement. Theyll text Skype attempt awkward phone sex and visit each other a few times a year. Advertisement Going the Distance will no doubt get razzed for having such low-stakes conflict. Being bummed that plane tickets are prohibitively expensive at Christmastime is hardly the stuff of high romantic drama. But the fact is most of our lives are made up of just such small disappointments. I appreciated this movies psychological minimalism It asks us to care about the quotidian details of Erin and Garretts struggle to stay close rather than contriving to place them in broad comic predicaments (though theres at least one of those too when theyre discovered in flagrante delicto on a dinner table). When the storys energy does flag Barrymore provides the juice to recharge it. Shes such a warm earthy presence on-screen with a loud cackling laugh that sounds genuinely amused. And she gets to crack a few good jokes of her own a development thats depressingly rare in a genre that often expects women to be wide-eyed foils or humorless ninnies. Justin Long doesnt quite have Barrymores firepower but hes carved out a niche for himself as the goofy nice-guy boyfriend wholl do anything for love (cf. Drag Me to Hell). The supporting players are used less well. The always-funny Christina Applegate doesnt get enough to do as Erins tightly wound germ-phobic sister and Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day as Garretts eccentric drinking buddies seem thrown in as concessions to Apatow bro-comedy. Nanette Burstein whose previous films have been well-regarded documentaries ( American Teen The Kid Stays in the Picture) doesnt direct with the surest hand--at times her camera performs distracting tricks unrelated to the material. But she knows how to let things happen between actors. Unlike the majority of wisecracking but dead-eyed rom-com couples Barrymore and Long seem to take real joy in each others company. Ill take that as an excuse to cling to the hope that romantic comedy that poor maligned once-glorious filmic genre may someday rise again. Like Slate on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + American movies can always be counted on to get some things wrong about everyday life brushing teeth telephones kissing but mostly and especially talking about sex. The line is fine between an honest conversation about sex and plain old dirty talk. There are in fact so few constructive conversations about procedure preference and pleasure that its possible to spend a lifetime wondering how a film industry that spends so much time and money in pursuit of sex puts so little of it on screen convincingly.I can say with a reasonable degree of confidence that the makers of ""Going the Distance arent virgins. When Drew Barrymore and Christina Applegate complain about their dissatisfaction with the performance of a certain act their specificity is both shocking on the one hand and perfectly normal on the other. This is a conversation women have everywhere except in the movies. Its been known to happen -- in ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High some Spike Lee movies occasionally when Catherine Keener opens her mouth. But their talk is hilarious here partly because it sounds new.""Going the Distance earns its R rating often by daring to say what goes frequently unsaid by women in raunchy comedies. Its not a very good movie. The entire second half is a sitcom. But unlike similar movies -- recent examples include anything starring a man and a woman in pursuit of our laughter -- its not cynical either. The screenwriter Geoff LaTulippe and the director Nanette Burstein manage to carve out an energetic sincere personality for their movie that verges on grown-up. The movie is old enough for Saks or Barneys but still shops at Urban Outfitters.Barrymore plays Erin a 31-year-old Stanford grad student interning somewhat farcically for the summer at a New York newspaper. One night she goes home with a junior executive at a record label Garrett (Justin Long) she met at a bar. They get stoned then spend the night together. Breakfast at a diner in the next scene is fraught with the familiar awkwardness of two participants in a one-night stand thinking about whether theyve made a mistake. (Isnt any postcoital breakfast already a kind of triumph?) They spend the rest of the summer dating. When her internship ends they bravely decide to keep seeing each other from across the country. They do so in defiance of Liz Lemons ""30 Rock axiom about long distance being the wrong distance.With them apart the film begins to rely on cliches. Erin moves in with her overbearing sister (Applegate) whos married to the sort of pre-middle-aged schlub (Jim Gaffigan) whos too bitterly betrothed to realize hes still handsome. Because theyre married Erins sister and brother-in-law have only weird shameful intimacy that the movie bleeds for a joke at least three times. Garrett bears his soul to his pals -- the not-as-annoying-as-he-should-be Charlie Day and the nifty mustache thats wearing Jason Sudeikis. They continue a current trend in romantic comedy in which the fretting and doubting and hoping are done by men who confide in buddies. The only difference between Day and Sudeikis and say Kim Cattrall and Cynthia Nixon is that the boys sweatshirts didnt cost about 475. (For his part Long puts away enough of his asexual smugness to disarm you. Still what does it say that in my memory it wasnt Long who played Garrett but Jimmy Fallon?)Even with all this talking Erin and Garretts relationship hits snags namely how the distance is terrible for intercourse. But they keep fighting to make it work and that fight is one of the reasons to like this movie. Its unusual in these comedies not to notice a screenwriter trying to force a couple to stay together. Instead you feel something more natural two immature people deciding to be adults together.That Erin and Garrett want to work in changing industries contributes extra layers of relevance poignancy and foolishness to the proceedings. (Run for the investment banks you two) Burstein has done documentary work with young people and I can only assume that she wanted a version of the adolescent candor in say the manicured nonfiction of her film ""American Teen.Barrymore is the other reason to like this movie. She officially no longer looks 16. Her face now has womanly angles and this recent development complements her innate girlishness. Shes newly sweetly sexy. During one of Erins early dates with Garrett Barrymore sits outside a restaurant in a black spandex top with pink straps peeking out from underneath. Her hair is scooped up in a willfully messy pile and theres a black bow tie around her bare neck. Its one of the most pleasurable movie images of downtown glamour I can think of -- the Playboy bunny by way of American Apparel flirtatious young self-confidently chic.Barrymore is now working in a grittier gear. Other female movie stars have said suggestive things. When Barrymore does it its fresh in both the vulgar and revelatory senses. Between this movie and her fascinating performance in HBOs ""Grey Gardens Barrymore at 35 is becoming a serious comedic actor.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Let it never be said that Going The Distance doesnt play by the romantic-comedy rules It stars Drew Barrymore the undisputed queen of the genre and features such stock elements as a scruffy best friend (two of them in fact in Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis) on the mans side the disapproving sister (Christina Applegate) on the womans side and a maddeningly contrived set of circumstances to keep the couple apart. Yet its the rare example of how the old formula can still work provided that its animated by good writing and appealing performances and that it never actively insults the audiences intelligence. Going The Distance could stand to color outside the lines a bit more but its perceptive about the problems of young people torn between pursuing love or their nascent career ambitions and the witty script by first-timer Geoff LaTulippe is spiked with refreshing profanity. By Hollywood rom-com standards its also blessedly low-concept When they meet in a New York City bar Barrymore and Justin Long are trying to get footholds in dying industries. Shes an intern for a daily newspaper thats shedding staff hes a low-level Aamp;R guy for a music label. Though Long is still smarting from a failed relationship Barrymore quickly proves better than a rebound mate and the two share six banter-filled weeks nearly falling in love. When a job opportunity takes Barrymore to San Francisco the pair enters into a long-distance relationship that tests their bond especially since neither of them can afford to fly out to see the other. That might all sound weirdly like a situation that would happen in real life which is one of the areas where Going The Distance deviates from the norm. LaTulippe and director Nanette Burstein (American Teen) a documentary filmmaker making her narrative debut arent interested in reinventing the genre but they ground it in a plausible situation and let it sink or swim on the strength of the performances and some very funny dialogue. Freed from the timidity of shooting for a PG-13 rating Day Sudeikis Applegate and a scene-stealing Jim Gaffigan as Applegates defeated husband are able to cut loose as the obligatory advice-givers and Barrymore seems more engaged and charming than usual. It all looks so effortless its a wonder that movies like Going The Distance are such an anomaly.

"Drew Barrymore shines in raunchy Going the Distance - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 3 starsDrew Barrymore shines in raunchy Going the DistanceSeptember 02 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie critic3 stars Warning This is not a reliable review of ""Going the Distance."" When it comes to contemporary American romantic comedy my brain heart and standards have been seriously compromised by ""The Ugly Truth"" ""The Bounty Hunter"" ""Did You Hear About the Morgans?"" and ""The Back-up Plan"" and many others. Too many others. The calculated sexual raunch (mostly verbal) in ""Going the Distance"" impinges on its hard-edged soft-center charm and that may be enough to throw various audience segments straight out of the thing. But screenwriter Geoff LaTulippes story of a recession-era long-distance relationship and its hurdles takes its characters seriously. Moreover it takes place in something like the real world and makes the most of its leading actors one of whom I never really liked much until this movie. I speak of Justin Long the rich mans Bob Denver. Here he plays Garrett a fledgling frustrated record-label Aamp;R rep tasked with overseeing a Jonas Brothers-style haircut band. Over a video round of ""Centipedes one night at a Manhattan bar this boy-man with ""Top Gun"" posters on his wall meets a newspaper intern for the fictional New York Sentinel. She is played by Drew Barrymore. Theres no other way to say it Barrymores a great broad. Has been for years in everything from ""Never Been Kissed"" to the idiotic ""Charlies Angels"" pictures. Her character here is a hard-drinking survivor of various bruising relationships and at 31 shes too old to be a fully self-respecting intern. Good detail that. Erin is to return to her native San Francisco in six weeks. A late-summer fling turns into a more vaguely defined commuter relationship kept alive by adrenaline game but awkward phone sex (clever scene) and frequent-flier miles. As ""Going the Distance"" pingpongs between the two coasts Erin and Garrett try to figure out if what they have is enough. Their career paths stink yet alternatives are hard to locate. (""Why dont you try blogging?"" Erins newspaper editor suggests distractedly.) The script zings everything from ""The Accused"" to Michael Bay movies. The secondary characters arent quite what they should be though Christina Applegate and Jim Gaffigan are deftly funny as Erins tightly wrapped sister and sad-sack brother-in-law. When the scenes are clicking director Nanette Burstein keeps the banter fast and loose. The atmosphere is deliberately low on polish; the way cinematographer Eric Steelberg lights the interiors the romance has to fight to assert itself. Will Erin and Garrett appeal to everybody? No. They smoke pot and drink sometimes obliteratingly and the leads potential romantic rivals are set up in a pedestrian way. But I liked the movie mainly for Barrymore. The way she handles the crucial early ""I love you"" moment (hes saying it to her and the camera shows us what shes thinking) you think This is one canny actress. MPAA rating R (for sexual content including dialogue language throughout some drug use and brief nudity) Cast Drew Barrymore (Erin); Justin Long (Garrett); Charlie Day (Dan); Jason Sudeikis (Box); Christina Applegate (Corinne); Jim Gaffigan (Phil); Kelli Garner (Brianna) Credits Directed by Nanette Burstein; written by Geoff LaTulippe; produced by Adam Shankman Jennifer Gibgot and Garrett Grant.

Going the Distance Bad to fair Director Nanette Burstein. Cast Drew Barrymore Justin Long Christina Applegate. Rating R for sexual content dialogue language drug use and brief nudity. Chick flicks Spotlight Drew Barrymore At times it has the sweet scruffy nature of ""(500) Days of Summer."" Then it suddenly switches gears and becomes crude and stupid full of gross-out humor in the ""Van Wilder"" tradition. In terms of tone and style the finished product ends up all over the place Think of it as the ""Sybil"" of romantic comedies. The movie focuses on Erin (Drew Barrymore) and Garrett (Justin Long). She is a journalism grad student wrapping up a summer internship at a New York newspaper; he works for a record company based in the city. Putting the two leads in industries experiencing major upheavals is a potentially interesting idea but first-time screenwriter Geoff LaTulippe doesnt take advantage of it. The workplace stuff is naive; this is the kind of movie in which editors use red pens to edit copy. Erin and Garrett meet over a vintage video game get stoned have sex and become a couple. But once her internship ends she heads back to California and the two struggle to make a long-distance relationship work. Texting goes only so far; what about physical contact? Temptations are tossed in in the form of flirty understanding co-workers of the opposite sex. The film has a fairly sturdy premise and director Nanette Burstein creates some nicely etched moments particularly the quiet give and take between Long and Barrymore. The two were reportedly a couple during the making of the film; if so it must have contributed to their easy natural chemistry. But the movies warmth and good sense go out the window when the filmmakers aim for broad comedy. Youve got Garretts creepy roommate (Charlie Day) who holds conversations while sitting on a toilet. There are also multiple sex scenes on a dining-room table and a thoroughly unfunny phone-sex sequence in which Long simply looks embarrassed. At least hes not Barrymore who performs a drunken scene with all the subtlety of Foster Brooks. At 35 the actress is four years older than the character shes playing yet she appears to be on the backside of 40 from the way she is photographed. During a scene set at a club she looks like the oldest person in the room. Its awkward to say the least. Still despite the movies flaws its hard to give up and just throw the towel in on it. When ""Going the Distance"" works it works well and it feels genuine. But like a bad relationship the movie will continually let you down.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr MORE WINGS PLEASE Drew Barrymore and Justin Long are out of napkins in Going the Distance B+ Going the Distance Genre Romantic Comedy; Starring Drew Barrymore Justin Long Charlie Day; Director Nanette Burstein; Release Date Wide 09/03/2010; Runtime (in minutes) 95; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted September 7 2010 -- 1200 AM EDT Going the Distance is a light and tasty morsel of a romantic comedy in which two smart funny and basically sweet people try to conduct a cross-country relationship. The movie which sounds like it was spun out of an advice column is very high-concept except that it has a gently authentic tone a flavor rooted in its affection for the shrewd innocence of the 1980s. For the first 15 minutes or so I actually wondered if it was set in the 80s. Erin (Drew Barrymore) whos 31 is finishing up her internship at a bustling newspaper The New York Sentinel and would do anything to land a job there. (I dont know too many 31-year-olds these days who even read newspapers let alone dream of working at one.) Garrett (Justin Long) an easy-come-easy-go womanizer works for a medium-size New York record label and what he does there sounds a lot like being an Aamp;R guy -- a job that may be even more tied to a bygone era than newspaper reporter. The two meet at a quiet homey bar that miraculously doesnt have a blaring sports TV and they proceed to bond over a round of the classic videogame Centipede. That night back at Garretts apartment they confess their mutual passion for Top Gun and Garretts roommate (Charlie Day) a scruffy loser who is listening to their every move blasts the films immortal Wagnerian-sap power ballad ""Take My Breath Away"" as they approach their first kiss. Its funny in a hot-tub-time-machine sort of way. After two love montages set to the Cures ""Just Like Heaven"" and the Pretenders ""Dont Get Me Wrong"" I began to think Between this feel-good 80s jukebox and the fact that no one in the film has yet sent a text message which year is this? As it turns out Going the Distance is quite contemporary but the wistful retro vibe is no accident. The director Nanette Burstein is a veteran of documentaries (she made American Teen and codirected The Kid Stays in the Picture) and here making a major gear shift to mainstream Hollywood comedy shes out to take us back to an earlier vibe -- to a time when pop music was optimistic and so were movie romances. Erin and Garrett dont just fall into glorified lust. They fall in love because they like each others company and Barrymore and Long have just the right sort of chemistry; they act out the rhythms of companionship. Going the Distance is mercifully free of the Styrofoam plot twists that drive most romantic comedies but it substitutes a development that by comparison may seem borderline inconsequential. Erin is set to go to grad school at Stanford and she and Garrett know theyre going to be together only for six weeks. Once she moves to the Bay Area though they realize they want to keep it going. And so they have to fly back and forth. And theyre frustrated. And horny. And jealous. (Each has a workmate flirt buddy.) Gee what do you think they should do? The script by Geoff LaTulippe is full of lines that pop. And Long whos always had a unique -- and to me not entirely appealing -- way of making floppy-haired boyishness reptilian comes alive as a movie star for perhaps the first time. He plays Garrett as the kind of guy who uses his wit as an antenna for connectivity. Burstein as a director is drawn to the Apatow school of humane obscenity. Going the Distance is filled with raunch -- a lot of it delightfully delivered by Barrymores Erin (she does a great original bit about receiving oral sex). But none of it is shock humor. This is comedy that catches the casual dirtiness of how men and women really talk. The blue dialogue liberates Barrymore who has never been this womanly and confident on screen. So wheres the dramatic conflict? Going the Distance introduces real-world complicating factors that are meant to reflect the stagnant economy. Thats why Erin and Garrett cant solve their long-distance problem. This gives the movie a surface topicality though it also keeps it low-key episodic benign and quaintly everyday. Not that thats such a bad thing. Going the Distance may be a minor movie but its also the rare romantic comedy in which you can actually believe what youre seeing.

"Going the Distance | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; going-the-distance ) Going the Distance (United States 2010) August 31 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli To date no motion picture has adequately captured the soaring highs and devastating lows associated with a long distance relationship but Going the Distance comes as close as any movie has. Nannette Bursteins feature gets many of the highlights right even if they are wrapped in the safety blanket of a traditional romantic comedy. Going the Distance isnt that fundamentally different from nearly every rom-com available in the multiplex market today with the exception that the ""romantic complications"" aspect which is normally filled by an old flame is represented here by distance and career demands. Like most enjoyable denizens of this genre Going the Distance offers a credible connection between the leads some light comedy and heartfelt romance and an ending that will not disappoint those who depend on fantasy resolutions to love stories be they serious or fatuous in nature. Going the Distance is divided into two parts. This first segment chronicles the ""meet cute"" between record producer Garrett (Justin Long) and journalist Erin (Drew Barrymore). Neither is looking for anything serious since shes only in New York for another seven weeks finishing off an internship at a newspaper. Of course they fall madly in love and decide to try to keep things going when September rolls around and she returns to California. The movies second act illustrates some of the difficulties of staying together with 3000 miles and three time zones in between and no real ""exit strategy."" Long-distance relationships are almost never long-term solutions. For them to work both parties have to be moving toward a mutually satisfactory goal. In Going the Distance this isnt the case. There are three apparent resolutions Garrett must give up his job (which he hates) and move across country Erin must abandon her dream (she gets an offer from a San Francisco paper) and join Garret in New York or both must turn their backs on the romance. Since this is a comedy not a tragedy were reasonably certain everything will turn out okay in the end but credit must be given to Burstein (whose previous effort was the semi-fake ""documentary"" American Teen) and screenwriter Geoff LaTulippe for acknowledging the pitfalls that undermine many long-distance relationships. Leavening the situation with comedy doesnt make it any less truthful. Aspects of Going the Distance especially regarding how Erin and Garrett handle their long-distance communication seem a little dated as if the script was drafted five (or so) years ago. The characters have cell phones but theres no evidence of a smart phone (especially noteworthy since Justin Long is arguably better known as an Apple pitchman than an actor). When the characters decide to become ""adventuresome"" and embark explore sexual options they try phone sex instead of Internet sex. They text each other but they fail to employ webcams (although curiously Erin uses one to converse with her sister). Maybe Going the Distance is intended to be a period piece and is actually set in the mid 00s. Justin Longs laid-back style is perfect for this role; its easy to identify with Garrett as a newly minted 30-something who has a stable job but is fundamentally dissatisfied with his life. The character is in limbo and Long brings this out without making Garrett seem too self-absorbed. For her part Drew Barrymore tones down the extreme sunniness she often brings to roles. Erin is bright funny and optimistic but not overflowing with such a wellspring of good cheer that we want to strangle her. The supporting cast includes a hilarious Christina Applegate as Erins neat freak sister whose idea of great sex is an extended session of dry humping and Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis as Garretts best friends. Sudeikis presence is welcome and his explanation of how his mustache is like a time machine has to be heard to be believed. Day on the other hand is occasionally annoying although his determination to provide a musical soundtrack to Garretts life has its moments. Anyone who has experienced a long-distance relationship will recognize echoes in Going the Distance the frustration of lengthy physical absences the craving for intimacy the highs of meeting at the airport and the lows of saying goodbye the difficulty of remaining faithful and the trepidation of facing an uncertain future. Going the Distance doesnt get all of this right but it captures enough for us to believe the characters and their situations. Plus although the overall rhythms are those of a generic romantic comedy the details are unique enough for the production not to seem overly formulaic. Its a nice understated way to end the summer.

Going the Distance is a not-very-good romantic comedy about the same kind of guy--Garrett (Justin Long) a frustrated Aamp;R drone at a New York record label who falls for Erin (Drew Barrymore) a 31-year-old newspaper intern. After a six-week fling Erin returns to school at Stanford thus forcing this couple to face the distance of the title. As Erin and Garrett struggle to stretch lust across 3000 miles via Skype its hard to maintain much interest in the fate of their union in part because what theyre like is so predicated on what they like and what they like--they bond over YouTube memes bar trivia and The Shawshank Redemption--is so fucking boring. Speaking of ""fucking"" Distance is rated R because everyone swears excessively for no reason the supporting cast of smart comedians (Charlie Day Jason Sudeikis) saddled with delivering painfully dumb often unnecessarily dirty dialogue. Timely issues keep Erin and Garrett apart--the financial crisis the changing face of both journalism and the music industry--but their quasi-realistic professional problems arent anything a little only-in-the-movies magic and moxie cant fix. Nanette Burstein reminds us she was previously a director of documentaries by occasionally shooting with a handheld camera for no discernible reason.

There almost seems to be a contest going on for worst scene worst character most cringe-inducing moment and most awesomely bad line. Star Drew Barrymore a fine actress and above-average filmmaker must have ambivalent feelings about this film which is certain to bomb anyway. The fewer people who see it the easier it will be to erase all memory of it.""Distance"" wants to be about a perfectly suitable quandary for a romantic comedy How can a couple maintain a hot relationship while living at opposite ends of the country? But that subject gets lost amid a welter of misjudgments ranging from bad gags and inane caricatures to a failure to take its lovers seriously. That its utterly predictable is the least of its sins.Probably the biggest miscalculation is the films potty mouth. One expects crudeness from the Judd Apatow school of comedy. Hormonally charged emotionally immature young men say and do all sorts of naughty things. But you recoil from toilet humor and continual vulgarity in a film about supposedly sophisticated adults struggling with real-life problems. Sprinkling the Geoff LaTulippe screenplay with foul talk is nothing more than a pathetic attempt by a ""chick flick"" to reach out to a younger and more male demographic. Oh and by the way not one laugh gets generated by any of this.A six-week romantic fling in New York between Barrymores Erin a journalism student and Justin Longs Garrett a junior executive at a record company has unintended consequences when Erin must return to San Francisco to pursue her studies Theyre both shocked to find they have fallen in love.The long-distance relationship takes its toll. Neither one can find full-time employment in the others city. Neither one believes that texting or Skyping makes a reasonable substitute for body contact. Looking for work in two beleaguered occupations -- journalism and music -- certainly can be a challenge but neither one seems to have ever heard the word ""freelance.""What prevents Erin from moving back to New York to freelance for media outlets since she already has a foot in the door with a major story in a New York daily? All other conflicts and characters in the film are equally as contrived The forced awkwardness Garrett experiences when meeting Erins family; her sisters (Christina Applegate) extreme dislike of Garrett; his phony jealousy over Erins handsome co-worker; and two best friends (Charlie Day Jason Sudeikis) you wouldnt wish on your worst enemy.Barrymore manages to maintain her dignity in all this numbing badness. Except of course for that drunk scene when she verbally assaults a barroom redneck. Oh and except for the phone sex between her and Long. Well come to think of it she does sacrifice her dignity a few times but no more than anyone else in this misbegotten production.Nanette Burstein whose background is in documentaries directed.Opens Friday Sept. 3 (Warner Bros.)Production New Line Cinema presents an Offspring Entertainment productionCast Drew Barrymore Justin Long Charlie Day Jason Sudeikis Christina Applegate Ron Livingston Oliver Jackson-CohenDirector Nanette BursteinScreenwriter Geoff LaTulippeProducers Adam Shankman Jennifer Gibgot Garrett GrantExecutive producers Dave Neustadter Richard Brener Michael DiscoDirector of photography Eric SteelbergProduction designer Kevin KavanaughMusic Mychael DannaCostume designer Catherine Marie ThomasEditor Peter TeschnerRated R 103 minutes FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Kirk Honeycutt THRnewsthr.com thr AP THRnewsthr.com thr Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""http//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> comments powered by Disqus The Hollywood Reporter (c) 2016 The Hollywood Reporter All rights reserved.

A geographically challenged relationship is put to the test in ""Going the Distance"" a bicoastal comedy with a bit of a bipolar disorder. While mostly free of overt gross-out moments this uneven effort saddles its likable leads Drew Barrymore and Justin Long with the kind of verbally exaggerated sexual humor that not only comes off as embarrassingly strained and calculated but also compromises what the picture genuinely wants to be -- a sweet sincere look at the often-competing priorities of work and romance. Sept. 3 release will rack up some B.O. mileage but lacks the off-the-charts hilarity needed to sustain altitude. Mere hours after being dumped by his g.f. New York record-label flunky Garrett (Long) manages to score with Erin (Barrymore) a Stanford journalism grad student in the final weeks of her summer internship at something called ""the New York Sentinel."" The two hit it off immediately bonding over beer bong hits sex and arcade games; neither one is in a hurry to commit although its clear from their cute dates at Coney Island and cheap Italian restaurants that theyre made for each other. At barely the half-hour mark Garrett rushes to catch Erin before she boards her plane back to San Francisco (neatly winking at the romantic-comedy cliche of the climactic race to the airport). They agree to give cross-country romance a try looking ahead to the prospect of Erin landing a full-time gig in New York and moving there permanently although Garretts loudmouth pals (Charlie Day Jason Sudeikis) and Erins overprotective older sister (Christina Applegate) have reservations about the situation. From that point onward Geoff LaTulippes script shuttles between Gotham and the Bay Area as Garrett and Erin keep in touch daily and even manage to steal a weekend together every few months. But the difficulties of a long-distance love affair soon assert themselves different time zones jealousy issues repressed horniness and the frustrating stasis of their situation exacerbated by Erins trouble finding gainful employment. ""Going the Distance"" reps the fiction-feature debut of helmer Nanette Burstein and it may be her documentary background (""On the Ropes"" ""American Teen"") that explains her interest in the refreshingly mundane question of what her characters do (or dont do) for a living. While the films depiction of the news media and the music biz has its share of naive simplifications its likely to strike a minor chord with anyone who has worked in either industry (Matt Servitto is spot-on as Erins brusque battle-weary editor). With its jet-setting leads and topical working-class concerns ""Going the Distance"" at times suggests a lowbrow ""Up in the Air"" as it pushes Erin toward a fateful decision between a West Coast job (somehow San Francisco has managed to avoid the slow death of print journalism) and an East Coast boyfriend. Unfortunately this poignant development is completely at odds with the films prevailing sensibility of in-your-face vulgarity and its here that Burstein displays a first-timers clumsiness. Moment by moment ""Going the Distance"" isnt especially funny which would be fine if it didnt stoop so low for laughs. While the explicitness is more verbal than visual it more than earns its R rating by having characters rattle on and on about subjects like masturbation auto-fellatio and dry humping for no reason at all. Far from seeming candid or provocative all this dirty talk feels leering and self-conscious a sop to mainstream convention; buried inside this foul-mouthed comedy is a leaner wiser drama trying to fight its way out. Capably playing a bit younger than their respective ages of 32 and 35 Long and Barrymore neither sizzle nor fizzle onscreen but achieve a pleasant sparky rapport his quick wit finding a nice complement in her good-natured spaciness (the actors offscreen relationship may serve as an additional selling point for curious viewers). As the obligatory second bananas Day (""Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia"") Sudeikis (""Saturday Night Live"") and Applegate are burdened with most of the scripts filthy non sequiturs; its hard not to feel they were cast for their comedic credentials but without any sense of how to channel their talents appropriately. Stabs at humor are further hobbled by awkward pacing and jarring transitions; scenes are often dragged out several beats too long leaving dead air around the punchlines. While a montage of Garrett and Erin calling texting and Skype-ing is technologically up-to-the-minute the soundtrack choices and pop-culture references (""Top Gun""? ""Moesha""?) often feel weirdly dated. New York-lensed production doesnt deliver a convincing facsimile of San Francisco although exterior shots of bridges in both cities form a nice visual correlative to the idea of coast-to-coast connection.
