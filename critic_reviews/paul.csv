(AP Photo/Universal Pictures) Photo Credit AP Photo/Photo Credit Double Negative/Universal Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Two sci-fi geeks meet an actual alien. BOTTOM LINE So the spaceman is a beer-drinking slacker -- got any other jokes? CAST Simon Pegg Nick Frost Kristen Wiig LENGTH 144 In the R-rated comedy ""Paul"" two sci-fi geeks encounter a real alien who turns out to be a rude-humored pot-smoking slacker from a Judd Apatow movie. Well thats one joke. Ninety more minutes to go. advertisement | advertise on newsday Simon Pegg and Nick Frost (""Hot Fuzz"") the likable British stars and writers of ""Paul"" do their best to amuse. They play Graeme Willy and Clive Gollings overgrown nerds touring Americas UFO hot spots in an RV. Along the way they pick up Paul a computer-animated space dude with the voice of Seth Rogen who is on his way to Wyoming for an important meeting. Aided by cold beers and classic rock a bromance blossoms though the buzz is periodically killed by the no-nonsense Agent Zoil (Jason Bateman whose deadpanning nearly saves the movie). ""Paul"" is so good-natured -- as is Paul himself thanks to Rogens cuddly persona -- that merely hanging out with the guys can be enjoyable enough. But the film directed by Dix Hills native Greg Mottola (""Superbad"") seems dead-set on being rough and ""edgy."" That mostly means gobs of profanity from Kristen Wiig as a newly enlightened creationist and from Bill Hader and Joe Lo Truglio as the usual hapless FBI types. Theres also an outdated gay joke from Rogen who is young enough to know better. VideoTrailer Paul The jarring violence at the end feels like another step in the wrong direction. If the filmmakers had gone for the milder rating that seems to be in their hearts ""Paul"" might have made a passable movie for kids. advertisement | advertise on newsday Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Close Encounters of the amp;% Kind In Paul aliens are not so much awe-inspiring as they are profanity-spewing. By David Edelstein Published Mar 18 2011 ShareThis (Photo Double Negative/Courtesy of Universal Pictures) In the eighties the writer Stephen Schiff covered the making of the hotly anticipated film Howard the Duck for Vanity Fair and when he told people on the set hed read the script and didnt think Howards witticisms were all that witty they said ""You have to imagine them coming from a duck."" We know how that turned out. The new comedy Paul from the Brit team of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost is like a Howard the Duck that works partly because this talking alien the title character smokes dope and drops four-letter words and boasts about the size of his sexual equipment. As in the filthy-minded Bad Santa the R rating makes the difference. When Frosts sci-fi geek asks whether he can understand Paul because the latter is using a Star Trek style ""universal translator"" the scrawny extraterrestrial with the giant brainpan and the voice of Seth Rogen says ""Im speaking English you fucking idiot."" The F-bomb improves things exponentially. Paul is happily marinated in geek-slob culture. On the road following San Diegos ComicCon (Obnoxious Fanboy Central) the two unsuccessful sci-fi nerds illustrator Graeme Willy (Pegg) and author Clive Gollings (Frost) pick up the jaded alien after he crashes a car near the site of a famed desert UFO encounter. Hes on the lam from the government which has held him since 1947--although not in isolation. He has had he explains an incalculable effect on popular culture especially via phone conversations with Steven Spielberg. The government though doesnt appreciate his contributions and now want to segment his brain. Hes being chased by men in black (if not Men in Black) led by Jason Bateman with Bill Hader and Joe Lo Truglio close behind on orders of an unseen woman with a steely voice familiar to aliens and avatars the world over. See Also Slideshow Pop Cultures Friendliest Invading Aliens Directed by Greg Mottola (Superbad Adventureland) Paul is the third and least original of the Pegg-Frost features but its still a lot funnier than most films of its ilk. Although its a broad takeoff on Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. its not in the superficial Scary Movie mode. Pegg and Frosts Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz (both directed by Edgar Wright) were more than loving parodies of George A. Romero and Bad Boys II; they were also nifty satires of capitalist-generated narcolepsy and provincial English cultures more fascistic impulses. Paul has a larger agenda too but the strokes are cruder. Pegg and Frost aim to extricate the E.T. mythos from Spielbergs mysticism and its attendant religiosity. Like many of their countrymen they fear the American anti-Darwin pro-creationist brand of fundamentalism which means their alien must set a brainwashed one-eyed trailer-park gal (Kristen Wiig) straight on evolution and the nonexistence of a Higher Power. Enlightened she spews obscenities and wants sex now. Its fun to see Pegg and Frost appropriate and then demolish Spielbergs starry-eyed imagery but Mottolas direction is too down-to-earth. Paul could have used Edgar Wrights exuberance his surreal mastery of pop-culture tropes his Spielbergian openness. (Wright was busy making Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World.) Theres also a sour vibe in the scenes in which Frosts Clive expresses hostility toward Paul for interrupting his bonding trip with Graeme previously the fount of many gay jokes Youd think the arrival of a talking alien would more than compensate for the letdown. The satirist should be careful never to cross the line into being a killjoy. Well as Paul might say ""Dont be such a pussy critic."" The CGI alien is very well articulated and Rogen is a virtuoso at mixing motormouthed rudeness with a hint of tenderness to take off the edge. Wiig does wonders with her spotty material Good and bad she sells it. In the climax when most of the characters--including Blythe Danner lyrically aggrieved as a woman alienated from the world by a past alien encounter--converge to await the inevitable mother ship Paul at last mingles mockery and wonderment. Finally were over the moon. Paul Directed by Greg Mottola. Universal Pictures. RE-mail filmcriticnewyorkmag.com. Share this story...

"Paul | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; paul ) Paul (Spain/France/U.K./United States 2011) March 18 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Paul is arguably the best science fiction comedy since Galaxy Quest. Despite being humorous in its outlook and providing numerous ""Easter eggs"" to fans of Star Wars Aliens Close Encounters and E.T. (amongst others) this isnt a parody. Outside the occasional affectionate jabs at science fiction fans and comic con attendees Paul avoids taking the satirical approach. Instead its a road trip and a buddy movie albeit one in which a participant happens to be an alien. Graeme (Simon Pegg) and Clive (Nick Frost) are visiting the United States from England with vacation destinations in mind that only a die-hard sci-fi geek could love first - Comic con second - a camper trip through the Southwest visiting all the ""classic"" UFO spots. They havent proceeded far on their journey when they have a close encounter of a weird kind. A profane alien who calls himself ""Paul"" (and whose voice is provided by Seth Rogan) introduces himself. Graeme is psyched but Clive passes out. Paul is on the run from U.S. government agents (led by Jason Bateman) and thinks the best way to get home is to join up with Graeme and Clive. The trio becomes a foursome when they kidnap Ruth (Kristin Wiig) a Christian zealot who thinks Paul is a demon. After she is enlightened via a mind-meld with the alien she represents a viable love interest for Graeme. Their future happiness is threatened not only by the Men in Black on their trail but also by Ruths gun-toting father (John Carroll Lynch) who wants his daughter back. There is little question that Pegg and Frost who wrote the screenplay are more than closet science fiction fans. Lines from Star Wars and Aliens show up in the script (with the Aliens one brilliantly incorporated). References to other science fiction staples abound with The X-Files Star Trek and E.T. warranting mention and a very big nod being given to Close Encounters of the Third Kind. In fact Steven Spielberg was so tickled by the story that he leant his vocal talents to a scene. (That is actually Spielbergs voice not an impersonators.) Its a little surprising the Star Trek elements are on the light side considering that Pegg is now playing Scotty. Despite taking place in the United States and being directed by an American the humor is very British as is fitting for a Pegg/Frost screenplay. There are amusing sequences but few will result in uncontrolled bursts of laughter. Its not that kind of movie. Paul wants its viewers to experience an enjoyable two hours and laugh from time-to-time but the films goal isnt to pummel the audience with joke after joke. It has a story to tell. An argument can be made that Seth Rogan is overexposed but hes a good choice for the voice of Paul. Heard but not seen he is effective. A digital creation inspired by the popular ""Roswell alien"" images (which were also the models for Spielbergs extraterrestrials in Close Encounters) Paul is realistically rendered and fits in so seamlessly that its easy to forget he isnt flesh-and-blood. Pegg and Frost play the kind of characters they have become associated with awkward socially inept guys who are more intimidated by women than by aliens. SNL veterans Kristin Wiig and Bill Hader who appeared in director Greg Mottolas previous venture Adventureland verge on going too far over the top for the tone established by the rest of the cast. Sigourney Weaver represents a casting coup if only for two memorable moments. Despite the science fiction trappings the odd appearance of the alien and a few ridiculous action sequences Paul is really little more than an old fashioned mismatched buddy film complete with a sentimental conclusion. The narrative incorporates elements of a road trip movie and a romantic comedy but more than anything it flourishes because of the unconventional relationship among Graeme Clive and Paul. In the past Pegg has done his best work when paired with Edgar Wright. Here without Wrights participation but with the help of Frost and Mottola he has crafted something every bit as good as either Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz. Its not as funny but it has more heart and replaces caricatures with something a little more three-dimensional. Lovers of pop science fiction (as opposed to the hard-core stuff) will derive more from Paul than generic movie goers but its a pleasant enough diversion for everyone. Even the profanity isnt that bad - just salty enough to earn the ""R"" rating - otherwise the movie is comprised of strictly PG-13 content. The special effects budget is on the high side but those effects serve the story rather than the other way around and Paul is all the better for it.

By Peter Rainer Film critic March 18 2011 Save for later Saved Writers and cast members Nick Frost (l.) and Simon Pegg pose at the premiere of Paul at the Graumans Chinese theater in Hollywood Calif. on March 14. The movie opens in the US on March 18. Mario Anzuoni/Reuters          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? The amusing conceit behind ""Paul"" is that an E.T. can be every bit as foul-mouthed and goony as any slacker. This is not quite enough of a conceit to sustain a full-length movie - ""Paul"" would have made a terrific short film - but there are incidental pleasures all along the way. Nick Frost and Simon Pegg who also double as screenwriters play geeky British tourists who rent an RV and scout out UFO landmarks in Nevada. Soon they are joined by an escapee from a top-secret military base Paul a scrawny alien who after 60 years on Earth just wants to get back to his own planet. Hot on their trail are federal agents (Bill Hader Jason Bateman and Joe Lo Truglio) of varying degrees of cluelessness.Im not sure that having a rabid ex-evangelical firebrand (Kristin Wiig) join the fray was such a masterstroke - it brings the movie into evolution/creationism terrain that is too scabrous for its own good. But Frost and Pegg who had a breakout hit with ""Shaun of the Dead"" are a wiggy team and director Gregg Mottola (""Superbad"" ""Adventureland"") has a genial touch. The movie despite what you may have gathered from the goofy trailer is more sweet than silly. Grade B (Rated R for language including sexual references and some drug use.)

Was That Klingon? Credit Universal Pictures The Lazarus Bird The Lazarus Bird Credit Universal Pictures One of the secrets to the appeal of the comedy Paul is simply this The extraterrestrial of the title voiced by Seth Rogen only smokes pot occasionally. Thats important if only because Rogen has done so many stoner movies and might-as-well-be stoner movies that a lot of people might be dubious about the potential of an alien doing that ""Huh-huh-huh"" laugh for 104 minutes. Might scare a lot of people off that prospect. And that would be a shame because Paul is a good-hearted funny movie. Written by and starring the team of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost (who are also responsible for Hot Fuzz and Shaun Of The Dead) Paul follows Graeme and Clive a pair of sci-fi-loving Brits on their U.S. tour. Their agenda is to hit Comic-Con -- the gigantic annual gathering of the superfans of just about everything that has superfans -- then drive around in a rented RV visiting the sites of Americas most famous UFO encounters. Along the way theyre shocked to encounter Paul a little alien in cargo shorts and flip-flops who needs their help to stay one step ahead of the guys in black sedans led by the imposing Agent Zoil (Jason Bateman). So now we have a road movie a buddy comedy and a sort of Dukes Of the Planet Hazzard thing going on. Inevitably a pretty girl (Kristen Wiig) hops in the guys mobile home for reasons too convoluted to detail so we have a love story as well. And the central joke which returns again and again is about what happens when two enthusiasts thoroughly steeped in pop-culture notions about aliens meet a real one -- one who knows all about E.T. fear of probes and The X-Files Agent Mulder. There are some cute nods to the world of sci-fi but theyre generally on the right side of the line between fun and smug. i After Paul breaks out of Area 51 he accompanies the guys on a cross-country road trip looking always for an escape to his home planet. Double Negative/Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Double Negative/Universal Pictures After Paul breaks out of Area 51 he accompanies the guys on a cross-country road trip looking always for an escape to his home planet. Double Negative/Universal Pictures Its a mistake to read Paul as some kind of exegesis on fandom either cutting or complimentary. Graeme and Clive are just guys and their fandom is there merely for the comedy setup. It doesnt define every single thing they do; their every line is not devoted to stressing that they only play video games never go outside have no social skills and so on down the list of stereotypes. Most important is their self-awareness. Theyve got a sense of humor and perspective about their enthusiasms wild as they are. In some ways Paul the alien serves the same functions as the classic movie type known as the Manic Pixie Dream Girl taking the heroes out of their comfort zones encouraging them to grow some confidence and live a little. (Though this pixie unlike Natalie Portmans character in Garden State actually has a shot at making it back to his home planet.) But Paul is ultimately affectionate; hes warmly funny as well as sharply funny a balance that isnt a surprise in a film shaped by Greg Mottola who directed both Superbad and the criminally underappreciated Adventureland. In a comedy of course whats most important about Paul is that hes funny at all. Happily so are Graeme and Clive and everyone else. Bill Hader and Joe Lo Truglio as the bumblers working for Zoil; Wiig as the potential love interest; Blythe Danner as an old friend of Pauls; David Koechner and Jesse Plemons as a couple of disgruntled truck owners; everybody gets laughs. Some of the jokes are cheap -- theres even a funny-name gag at the end -- and some of them are dry but enough of them work that its great fun throughout. Ultimately Paul is a story about a couple of buddies who get a new pal and he gets them into some scrapes and they meet some people and they visit some places and crazy things happen and ... thats the movie. Theres a campfire theres a chase theres a kiss. You dont watch a movie like this for the groundbreaking plot; you watch it because its well executed and great fun. And here because Seth Rogen doesnt spend too much time laughing.

Reviewed by Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 18 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 241PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The new alien movie spoof Paul from the English writing-acting team of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost is less out-of-this-world than you might wish. The team that gave us the inspired zombie-com Shaun of the Dead and the action flick send-up Hot Fuzz is working in a different register here more Judd Apatow-style scattershot than their usually precise comic homage. Movie Paul The official trailer Its not just the duos transfer to an American setting from an English one that changes the tone. Its also the trade-in from English director Edgar Wright who kept things fast and saucy through those early films for Greg Mottola ( Superbad Adventureland) whose mode is more episodic with lots of cameo space for the extensive supporting cast of Arrested Development and Saturday Night Live secondary comic characters. The results it must be said are less hi-larious than sporadically mid-to-low-larious. The opening finds the two bantering Brits in San Diego wide-eyed at the annual Comic-Con where writer Clive Gollings (Frost) and his best friend and illustrator (Pegg) meet their supercilious idol (Jeffrey Tambor checking in with cameo No. 1). They then leave the nerd fest in a rented recreational vehicle determined to visit all the supposed UFO sites in the American Southwest. After meeting a sassy Nevada waitress (Jane Lynch) at a diner they manage to upset a couple of local goons and head off in a hurry. Out on the road at night near the military base known as Area 51 they witness a car crash and subsequently meet the titular hero Paul. Hes a child-sized classic bulbous-headed big-eyed alien who also happens to sound exactly like stoner-dude comedian Seth Rogen. For 60 years he explains he has been working as a consultant for the military and Hollywood and has acquired the bad habits of drinking and smoking (both standard cigarettes and herbal). Now that the military probes are about to turn life-threatening he wants to phone home. Next complication is a girl. At a trailer park run by a gun-toting Bible-thumping wing nut (John Carroll Lynch) they pick up with his creationist-spouting daughter Ruth (Kristen Wiig) whose narrow perspective is captured in her one-lens sunglasses. When Ruth catches sight of Paul and assumes hes a demon the trio has no choice but to kidnap her and convince her of the errors of her fundamentalist thinking (the most brashly British part of the movie). Soon she discovers the art of cursing and promises to move on to fornicating and other sins. Initially this off-beat performance from Wiig is charming though it gets a bit tiresome the 20th time she utters an unorthodox combination of naughty words. As this is going on a trio of men-in-black special agents are chasing the boys and the alien cargo. Theyre led by a no-nonsense chief (Jason Batemen) whos taking phone directions from a ruthless superior instantly recognizable as Sigourney Weaver. His incompetent underlings ( SNLs Bill Hader and Joe Lo Truglio) add slapstick and another layer of misunderstandings with Blythe Danner popping up late in the film as a Spielbergian little-girl-who-grew-up. Some of the later scenes capture the spirit of majestic sweetness of Close Encouners of the Third Kind and E.T The Extra-Terrestrial period but the elevated moments dont last. Theyre relentlessly undermined by the f-bombs groin kicks and anal-probing jokes. As they proved with Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz Frost and Pegg know their movie genres and Paul is packed with allusions to other science fiction films from the late seventies on - silly little things like a country band honky-tonking through the music from the Star Wars bar scene. No doubt future fanboys will ""partake"" as Paul puts it of their favourite time-travelling herb and find endless opportunities to play spot-the-reference. Think of it as one more excuse not to get a life.

"Paul review Comedy about an extraterrestrial stoner Lacks laughs |       NJ.com comments Paul review Comedy about an extraterrestrial stoner Lacks laughs Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on March 18 2011 at 800 AM View/Post Comments AP Photo/Universal PicturesFrom left Simon Pegg Kristen Wiig Nick Frost and Paul the alien voiced by Seth Rogen are shown in a scene from the film ""Paul."" For years scientists have been searching outer space for intelligent life. And as Monty Python once observed lets hope they find some because theres precious little here on Earth. Take for example ""Paul."" ""Paul"" -- awful title -- was written by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost the British actors who also co-star. Greg Mottola who seemed on a roll with ""Superbad"" and ""Adventureland"" directs. And theyre three minds without a single thought -- or at least without any good ones. Pegg and Frost hit in the zombie farce ""Shaun of the Dead"" and as performers they do have a sort of allotment-garden charm to them (Pegg is the rabbitty one Frost the one who looks a bit like a mole). But the comedy theyve written needs about three times as many jokes. Mottola meanwhile seems to have forgotten half of what he knew about pacing and visual style. The big ""reveal"" -- a guest star whose third-act surprise appearance is supposed to be a big gag -- is obvious from the first time you hear her voice. A corny image -- a shocked person going stiff as an ironing board before falling backward -- is done three times. Movie Review Paul (R) Universal (104 min.) Directed by Greg Mottola. With Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Now playing in New Jersey Rating note The film contains strong language sexual references and violence. Stephen Whittys Review TWO STARS There are also a lot of crude look-at-these-bloody-Yanks stereotypes -- Bible-thumping rednecks hillbilly hunters illegal-immigrant busboys bumbling-but-uptight FBI agents -- that probably seem a lot funnier to writers who have never actually you know lived here. The basic story has sci-fi fanboys Pegg and Frost finding an alien out in the American desert. Hes called Paul and hes trying to get home; they vow to help and load him into their enormous rented R.V. (another not-quite-right Ugly American cliche). The big gag here is that Paul while looking like your standard ""Close Encounters"" creature is voiced by Seth Rogen -- and sports flip-flops baggy shorts a foul mouth and a taste for weed. Yeah Ill phone home later dude but first wheres the bong? The characters mildly funny. But the CGI work is both ugly and pointless (it would have been better and cheaper to simply put a skinny kid in some makeup). And the American jokes arent just tiresome -- theyre not particularly good. Pegg tries hard (perhaps because none of his efforts since ""Shaun"" have really traveled well). And theres a wealth of pop-culture references for fanboys if toting up inside jokes is your idea of fun. (Although some of the touchstones -- a ""Lorenzos Oil"" nod? -- are simply inexplicable.) True the basic idea is a good one -- for maybe a quick Mad magazine story. But theres not a whole movies worth of jokes here and the broadness of the humor (lots of inappropriate cursing and slapstick violence) shows the mounting desperation. Beam us up Scotty. Theres no intelligent life here.

Starring Simon Pegg Nick Frost Kristen Wigg Bill Hader Jane Lynch Jason Bateman Seth Rogen Sigourney Weaver Director Greg Mottola Running time 140 Release Opened Mar 18 2011  Editorial Review Alien sedition on galactic scaleBy Michael OSullivanFriday March 18 2011Judging by appearance the titular CGI hero of ""Paul"" -- a wrinkled pencil-necked geek with big almond-shaped eyes and the rumbling voice of Seth Rogen -- could be a distant cousin of Rango Johnny Depps cowboy-chameleon character in the recent animated film of the same name. But unlike that PG-rated kids cartoon ""Pauls"" R-rated protagonist is not a lizard but a wise-cracking space alien who landed on Earth 50 years ago and is now on the lam from the Men in Black. The derriere-flashing dope-smoking potty-mouthed antics of this antisocial E.T. justify every bit of the rating that the MPAA has slapped on him.Which is not to say that the movie is in any way grown-up.Much of its broad juvenile humor derives from a single incongruity. That comes from the sight or rather the sound of this little green man -- who is actually to be more precise putty-colored -- as he spouts a torrent of unprintable Anglo-Saxonisms in between tokes of wacky weed tobacco and swigs of beer. It seems that in the time he has been detained as a guinea pig in a secret U.S. military facility he has picked up a few bad habits.The movies premise is simple. Paul -- whose name our alien protagonist borrowed from the dog his spaceship accidentally flattened when he crash-landed here a half-century ago -- finally has managed to escape from the Area 51-like research lab where he has been imprisoned. While on his way to a rendezvous with his mothership Paul runs into Graeme and Clive (Simon Pegg and Nick Frost of ""Shaun of the Dead"") two British sci-fi geeks whose idea of an American holiday is an RV tour of the Southwests most famous UFO sites. Once Graeme and Clive get over their initial shock that Paul can talk (albeit with a somewhat limited vocabulary) they agree to drive their foul-mouthed new friend to his destination. Things get complicated however with the appearance of a shadowy government agent (Jason Bateman) whose dogged pursuit of Paul precipitates the violent mayhem gunplay car crashes and explosions that characterize the films familiar-looking climax.Amid all this testosterone however theres a refreshing shot of estrogen courtesy of Kristen Wiig. Playing a fundamentalist-Christian RV park manager who somehow gets swept up with the three fugitives Wiig provides a daffy counterpoint to the films at-times-tedious boys-club vibe which manifests itself in such ways as a running joke about whether Graeme and Clive are gay. Theyre not by the way. Not that theres anything wrong with that as the film takes pains to reassure us. But its writers (Pegg and Frost) pound the joke into the ground long after the humor is gone.Wiigs Ruth is more consistently funny. This comes as no surprise to those who know the actresss work on ""Saturday Night Live."" A goody-two-shoes who doesnt believe in evolution -- until she undergoes a mind-melding exchange of consciousness with Paul that turns her understanding of faith and science on its head -- Ruth goes from being a self-righteous Bible-thumper to a foul-mouthed libertine overnight. Except that she never gets it exactly right. Whats funniest about Ruth -- as opposed to Paul whos just as vulgar -- is that shes new at the game. Paul has had 50 years to practice. Ruth doesnt really know how to put two swear words together properly which sweetens the characters newfound dirty-mindedness.There are other charms. Pegg and Frost sprinkle the film with in-jokey allusions to such other sci-fi culture as ""alien"" ""E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial"" ""Star Wars"" and ""The X-Files."" Its more than occasionally cute if less than consistently clever.By the standards of mainstream movies though theres little thats particularly paranormal about ""Paul."" Rather than poking fun at the conventions of Hollywood sci-fi it for the most part obeys them.Contains pervasive crude language sexual humor violence drug use and smoking.

"This close encounter with satire not enough - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs This close encounter with satire not enoughPaul a 2 starsMarch 17 2011|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticSomewhere along the lines of a few too many mediocre scripts even the best comic actors begin confusing energy with quality and before you know it you have a performance such as Simon Peggs in the new movie ""Paul."" What has happened to Pegg? Why does he mug so? Why cant he relax and let the audience come to him rather than auditioning for our affection with every reaction shot?Pegg and his screenwriting partner Nick Frost co-starred in the zesty imaginative Edgar Wright spoofs ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz""; this time as writers and performers they tackle the subculture of science fiction and comic book geekery along with Spielbergian notions of extraterrestrials. Underneath all that they have a few things to say about what they see as a peculiar American leniency toward firearms and Christian fundamentalism.Graeme and Clive played by Pegg and Frost are budding fantasy fiction authors and illustrators who travel from London to San Diego for the annual Comic-Con and then for a road trip of the American West. One starry desert evening determined to hit all the ""UFO hot spots"" they experience a close encounter with a highly assimilated alien named Paul (voice by Seth Rogen). The computer-generated dude with the teardrop-shaped peepers has escaped his U.S. government captors and is determined not just to phone home but get there.Paying homage to among other films ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""E.T."" ""Paul"" presents its title character as a rather uninteresting slacker who can turn himself invisible at will and who plays matchmaker to Graeme and the sheltered trailer-park manager played by Kristen Wiig.Somethings off with ""Paul"" from the start. The tone feels pushy and strenuous the timing a beat or two off. Director Greg Mottola has done fine work in the past including ""The Daytrippers"" ""Superbad"" and the truly special coming-of-age picture ""Adventureland"" but here his work plays like guesswork. The script avoids going full-bore as satire. Where it goes instead lacks a purpose a reason for being beyond the usual name-checking of ""The X-Files"" and the like.Among a supporting cast including Jason Bateman as a shadowy government op and Jane Lynch as a diner owner Wiigs the freshest aspect of ""Paul."" The primary joke behind her buttoned-down character involves a Bible-thumped shut-in discovering a wider world while relishing awkwardly the joys of foul-mouthed invective. The joke isnt fresh. But the performer makes it seem that way.mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating R (for language including sexual references and some drug use)Cast Simon Pegg (Graeme Willy); Nick Frost (Clive Gollings); Jason Bateman (Agent Zoil); Kristen Wiig (Ruth Buggs); Bill Hader (Haggard); Blythe Danner (Tara Walton); Joe Lo Truglio (OReilly); John Carroll Lynch (Moses Buggs)Credits Directed by Greg Mottola; written by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost; produced by Nira Park Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner.

Photo As two nerdy Brits Nick Frost (left) and Simon Pegg are shocked and awed when their sci-fi dreams come true. ( ) Simon Pegg Kristen Wiig Nick Frost and ""Paul"" Seth Rogen ( ) Paul"" takes us to a strange and terrible place populated by misshapen asexual freaks -- San Diegos Comic-Con -- in the process of reinventing ""E.T."" as a Seth Rogen movie. Naturally Pauls likes include Reeses Pieces and weed. After ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" Simon Pegg and Nick Frost reteam to write and star in another fond genre salute this one bouncy with the fanboy pleasures of such classics as ""E.T."" ""Aliens"" and um ""Mac and Me."" Set your humor-detection capacitors for moderate to above-average intake levels. I havent laughed this much since maybe last Monday but that was a particularly strong Monday. Graeme (Pegg) and Clive (Frost) are sci-fi-loving English nerds on holiday in San Diego and the American Southwest where they seek out the holiest shrines in the-truth-is-out-there lore such as Roswell and the Black Mailbox. One vehicular mishap later their RV is a hiding place for an alien named Paul (voiced by Seth Rogen) whose spaceship crash-landed in the desert in 1947 and who has spent the decades since advising governments and other critical institutions. ""Agent Mulder was my idea"" he brags. Now the G-men led by a ruthless Man in Black (Jason Bateman) and his double-ruthless boss the Big Guy (not a guy but something far scarier -- Sigourney Weaver) want to trap Paul so they can harvest his brain cells. If there are any left after Paul smokes all the military-grade pot he can carry. There may come a day when I tire of Seth Rogens shtick but I hope it doesnt come soon. (Yes I loved ""The Green Hornet""). His sarcastic insults and Transgalactic Delta House ebullience keep things rolling along (even if the gay jokes are a little stale) as the boys pick up more enemies and a kindly one-eyed fundamentalist Christian (the indispensable Kristen Wiig) who says of Paul ""Hes not evil. Hes just a bit rude."" After Paul transfers to her all the knowledge of the universe she gives up her faith in God but becomes a devoted curser even if she doesnt quite understand which dirty words to use in which contexts. Her attempts are adorable. ""I can drink?"" she marvels. ""I can fornicate?"" Brave new world The character is so lovable itll be difficult for anyone to take offense except maybe the fiercest Darwin haters. (She sports a T-shirt showing Jesus shooting Darwin.) Bateman has rarely had the opportunity to play a snarling lawman but with his cool aviators and his bristling putdowns hes perfect too and Pegg and Frost are generous enough (and smart enough) to spread the comedy opportunities around even supplying a Monty Python moment involving Weaver and a chance for Blythe Danner to go all badass. The laughs get a bit thin during a lengthy chase scene reminiscent of the overly busy climax of Rogens ""Pineapple Express"" but things pep up nicely for a very Steven Spielberg ending. If Steven were you know just goofing around and drinking beer with his buds. Lines like ""Bring me back my space monkey"" ""Hey -- probing time"" and ""Sorry you got killed by my dad"" make ""Paul"" a sweetly quotable close encounter of the nerd kind.

"Paul (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Paul (R) A close encounter of the worst kind. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald3/17/2011 Editor rating 1 What if E.T. had been a foul-mouthed pothead-party monster? Thats probably the idea the British duo of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost started with when they came up with Paul  which aims to do to science-fiction films what Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz did for zombie pictures and cop-buddy comedies Satirize the genre while still delivering an over-the-top  example of the form. But something went seriously wrong with Paul. Maybe the absence of buddy Edgar Wright who directed Pegg and Frosts first two movies threw the writers off. Or maybe British satire loses something when its handled by Americans You miss the perspective that a foreign culture brings so instead of wit and humor you end up trafficking in self-congratulatory cliches and sentiment. Paul was directed by the estimable Greg Mottola (The Daytrippers Superbad Adventureland) and boasts a surprisingly deep cast (even Steven Spielberg makes an appearance of sorts). And yet I still sat through it with gnashing teeth and increasingly weary brow counting the minutes until it was over. How could so many talented people collaborate on something so dull? The blame I think rests with Pegg and Frosts previous successes which have made them a little overconfident and creatively sloppy. In Paul they often dont bother to write actual jokes They settle for homage and references to other films the way the Shrek pictures did. Recreating scenes from E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial in painstaking detail or having the house band at a roadside honky tonk playing the Star Wars cantina song is all well and good but you also have to come up with something funny to happen in the foreground. Otherwise youre asking the audience to laugh simply out of recognition -- ""Hey that movie theater marquee is advertising Duel"" -- which is the laziest sort of comedy. Its hack work. Pegg and Frost play Graeme Willy and Clive Gollings British nerds who travel to the United States to attend the San Diego Comic-Con lust after girls dressed as Ewoks contemplate buying 1000 samurai swords and get books autographed by a disdainful science-fiction author (Jeffrey Tambor in the first of the films many star cameos). After San Diego Graeme and Clive whom everyone takes for gay because of their accents hit the road in a rented RV to visit sites of alien encounters Area 51 the Black Mailbox Roswell N.M. During the trip they meet an actual alien (computer-generated and voiced by Seth Rogen) who acts like a frat boy talks like a sailor and is trying like so many extra-terrestrials stranded on Earth before him to get home. When I first saw the trailer for Paul which has been inescapable in theaters for the past couple of months I figured the R-rated movie had to hold back on its best stuff. But no. Practically all of Pauls big jokes are in the trailer and theyre still not funny when you see them again with lots of four-letter words thrown in. Unlike Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz which shook up archetypal story formulas with lots of sudden curves Paul sticks to the tried and true and banal The alien is a spirited sort who teaches the friends to loosen up embrace their inner geek and get the girl. A squad of government agents (Jason Bateman Bill Hader and Joe Lo Truglio) is hot on the trios heel eager to get Paul into government custody by any means necessary. Kristine Wiig plays Ruth the repressed one-eyed daughter of a Christian fundamentalist who has her narrow horizons cosmically expanded after a mind meld with Paul (""Im going to do a lot of fornicating"" the liberated Ruth says). Wiig gets the films funniest T-shirt its funniest bit in which her character smokes pot for the first time and its funniest recurring gag as Ruth puts her newfound freedom to curse to ever-inventive use. I also laughed a lot at the reveal of the full name of Batemans secret agent -- the one time in the movie in which a reference to another film is genuinely witty and its not even a sci-fi picture. The rest of this tiresome dud plays like an R-rated movie for kids one that forces subversive actors such as Bateman and Wiig to flash earnest feel-good smiles directly into the camera when they discover Paul isnt really dead and everything is going to be all right. Did Mottola cringe while he was directing that scene as much as I did when I watched it? Thats the kind of stuff Pegg and Frost used to make fun of. Now theyve become part of the problem. Get thee back to England boys and quick. Cast Simon Pegg Nick Frost Kristen Wiig Jason Bateman Bill Hader Joe Lo Truglio John Carroll Lynch Blythe Danner and the voice of Seth Rogen.

(Photo Credit Double Negative/Un) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday March 18 2011 400 AM Title Paul With Simon Pegg Nick Frost. Comedy about geeks who befriend an alien. Director Greg Mottola (144). R Language crude humor violence drugs. At area theaters.If you were visiting Earth for the first time youd probably think Greg Mottolas ""Paul"" was a decent comedy good-natured if unspecial amusing if rarely hilarious.Regulars on this planet however may also be a little disappointed -- especially those familiar with the stars other work.Along with English director Edgar Wright Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have made two of the sharpest funniest films in recent memory ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz.""While Wrights movies satirized Hollywood blockbusters Pegg and Frost -- who wrote ""Paul"" together -- have now set their sights on American success. The results suggest they dont expect too much of us.This cheerfully broad utterly mainstream effort brings two U.K. fanboys to San Diego for Comic-Con. Graeme (Pegg) and Clive (Frost) leave the sci-fi convention in fits of excitement determined to discover a real UFO. Naturally theyre stunned when they meet an actual alien.Paul (voiced by Seth Rogen) is running from agents (Jason Bateman Sigourney Weaver) determined to cut the little guy open and study his giant brain. Graeme Clive and Graemes new girlfriend (Kristen Wiig) promise to protect him until he finds his mothership. But its clear time is running out.Though part of the joke is that Paul understands pop culture better than his British buddies its somewhat deflating to find our extraterrestrial hero is just a shorter greener version of a Judd Apatow character. (It doesnt help that Apatow regular Rogen is the one cursing making rude noises and reeling off gay jokes.)Like his collaborators Mottola (""Adventureland"") is capable of better work. But he keeps the energy high and pacing swift racing through references from ""Alien"" to ""Xanadu"" with a speed that should thrill real Comic-Con regulars. And while Frost is particularly well-cast most of the actors seem to be having fun. You will too as long as you arrive with lowered expectations.Its worth mentioning that Pegg and Frost have already addressed sci-fi geekdom in far smarter fashion back home. If youre really looking for signs of intelligent life track down their Britcom ""Spaced"" instead.

Starring Nick Frost Simon Pegg Jason Bateman Blythe Danner and the voice of Seth Rogen. Directed by Greg Mottola. (R. 104 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) People who know theyd like a movie about two comic-book geeks who meet up with an alien already know they want to see ""Paul."" So this is addressed to people who are not in that category who are not particularly interested in comic books geeks or aliens This is a well-made well-plotted and sensitive movie. ""Paul"" was directed by Greg Mottola who was 3-for-3 going into this film and is now 4-for-4. His previous movies - ""The Daytrippers"" ""Superbad"" and ""Adventureland"" - demonstrated his capacity for depicting the longings of misfit characters an ability that comes into play here. Mottola started out in independent films but he doesnt lose his soul when confronted with big budgets. He has a humane vision. He is not prone to harsh judgments. And he knows how to elicit big laughs while not compromising the reality and fullness of his characters. If youre looking for an example of Mottolas taste and directorial instinct notice how he directs Blythe Danner who shows up two-thirds of the way into ""Paul"" as a woman who had an alien encounter as a child and whose subsequent life was damaged as a result. Related Stories Paul Every indication of the script would suggest that this little featured role be played for comedy. Instead its as if Danner has been told that she is acting in a serious drama. Instead of becoming discordant the performance provides a dimension of sorrow that adds immeasurably to the movies richness. Most of ""Paul"" concerns two fellows from England Graeme (Simon Pegg) and Clive (Nick Frost) who come to the United States for a comic-book convention then go on a trip to UFO sites in the Southwest. Before they even meet the alien which happens within minutes theyve already charmed the audience with their ingenuousness their goofy delight in being in America and their very lived-in long-term friendship. Indeed Graeme and Clive are so pleasant to be around that it feels like an iron-footed imposition when the movie introduces Paul who looks like every movie alien youve seen for the past 40 years Hes little and thin bigheaded and diamond eyed. He starts talking and out comes the deep voice of Seth Rogen and for just a few minutes theres an uh-oh feeling that maybe ""Paul"" after an engaging opening is about to derail into the obvious and sophomoric. But the script by Pegg and Frost is strong full of incident and propulsion. Paul is on the run from the U.S. government agents whod like to dispose of him (or at least keep him prisoner) while he just wants to go home. The movies references to the Steven Spielberg movies (""Close Encounters"" ""E.T."") are intentional and integrated within the world of the film - Paul apparently worked as an uncredited consultant for Spielberg and Spielberg himself (or rather his voice) turns up in a funny cameo. The clever script finds humor in fresh pop culture references and in peoples terror of the ""anal probe"" something they assume all aliens want to do to them. But essentially ""Paul"" is a chase movie with a government agent in the form of Jason Bateman doing everything he can to track down Paul before he makes his escape. Even in a fairly one-note role Batemans dual nature his way of playing two actions at once (what hes doing and what hes really thinking) is a distinct asset. Kristen Wiig perhaps benefits most from working with Mottola. As a conservative fundamentalist whose entire worldview transforms after she meets Paul Wiig is in a role that could have been pure satire. But she plays every moment for truth and comes up with a characterization thats honest and nuanced and much funnier than it ever could have been otherwise. -- Advisory This film contains drug use.

"Movie review Paul - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-PaulMovie review PaulThe whimsical and gentle buddy comedy comes as a relief. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost star as fanboys who go on the run to protect a weed-toking alien (voiced by Seth Rogen).March 18 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Seth Rogen provides the voice of a rude and sometimes crude alien named Paul... (Double Negative / Universal...)Dont let ""Pauls"" R-rating fool you. In the latest comedy from those funny Brits of ""Hot Fuzz"" and ""Shaun of the Dead"" the wise guys have gone more off-center than off-color with this whimsical and surprisingly gentle road trip adventure about two friends an obsession and an alien named Paul. After the sharp bite and harsh light of most American-style guy-based funny films today ""Paul"" comes as such sweet relief. If not for a lot of F-bombs and other naughty words this would be a family film a sort of fractured ""E.T."" with Seth Rogen never more likeable than as the bald-headed extraterrestrial who just wants to phone home (he should consider this kind of disappearing act a la Mike Myers and Shrek more often). The film was written by and costars the ""Hot Fuzz"" cops and ""Shaun"" zombie hunters Simon Pegg and Nick Frost perfecting their affable pair personas as friends on the run to protect this alien intruder. Like the earlier two films which Pegg wrote with Edgar Wright (who directed ""Fuzz"" and ""Shaun"") ""Paul"" is an ode to films past. In this case the target for all the sight gags and slight puns is sci-fi movies great and small but mostly Spielberg-ian starting with Paul himself a gray-green shorter version of those ethereal beings of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" but with ""E.T."" hands. The movie is a good fit for director Greg Mottola with a filmmaking vocabulary in which ""sentimental"" is not a dirty word (see the lovely 80s nostalgia of ""Adventureland""). Here he has created an easy marriage between the British hysteria (proper and restrained dont you know) of road-trippers Graeme Willy (Pegg) and Clive Gollings (Frost) and the laid-back mellow yellow of Pauls weed-toking flip-flop wearing CGI wonder (thanks to effects wizards at Double Negative for creating the most excellent illusion that Paul is always and actually really truly there). As all tall tales of fanboys should the story begins in San Diego at that annual gathering of sci-fi movie freaks Comic-Con. Graeme and Clive are in the crush of all the convention crazies yet still managing to look nerdy and out of place even in a crowd that favors Darth Vader-wear. The ""were all aliens"" and ""its hard for a lot of us to fit in"" themes are well established long before Graeme and Clive set out in their RV after the convention closes. Their quest is to visit all of the major close-encounter hot spots around the country. By the time they hit Area 51 and come face to face with Paul we understand their outsiderness their completely adorable geekdom and most of us will feel their pain. The trip picks up speed once Paul is on-board. Hes been hanging out (well imprisoned) at a secret military facility for 60-some years where Zelig-like hes been advising world leaders and moviemakers (all of this made funnier by the lack of irony). But now the security chief wants to see what might be learned by poking around inside that big head of his. Much of the real action comes as Paul goes on the run with Clive and Graeme recruited as his reluctant accomplices and a tag-team of special agents on their tail. Overall the casting is spot on and the cameos are clever. Among the central ensemble are comic regulars Jason Bateman as Agent Zoil (full-name Lorenzo Zoil a play on ""Lorenzos Oil"" that will either bring a smile or a groan) with Kristen Wiig in a nice turn as a hyper-religious possible love interest for Graeme. There is no real attempt at serious depth here and Mottola with cinematographer Lawrence Sher keeping things light and breezy. Sher has emerged as a sort of a comic specialist with an indie-feel starting with such films as ""Garden State"" and ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" and moving on to bigger stages with ""The Hangover"" and ""I Love You Man"" among others. Along with the rest of the production team theyve given everything in the film a sort of rumpled empty potato-chip bag look. As a running riff on all the sci-fi movie conventions a lot of scenes will feel familiar because they are just put through the Pegg-Frost juicer. And that is the central key a without the guys the result just wouldnt be nearly as appealing. Somehow they have created characters who are both smart and buffoonish in such an embraceable way and a friendship that feels so true (they are real life longtime friends as well as creative collaborators) that good times are to be had spending time with them. If the films not quite out of this world its close enough. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESCritics Pick The Worlds End caps summer with a fun pub...September 5 2013The Worlds End a refreshing late-summer comedy critics...August 23 2013Review The Worlds End feels like a celebrationAugust 22 2013Will The Worlds End be the most entertaining movie of...August 17 2013MORE STORIES ABOUTPaulSimon PeggEdgar WrightCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-paul-20110318,0,4034495.story",200,paul17,paul,latimes
"Paul Not your average alien stoner road-trip comedy - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Paul Not your average alien stoner road-trip comedy By Scott Bowles USA TODAY Updated | | Share Reprints amp; Permissions Paul comes here in peace though that could be because hes also a little stoned. By Double Negative Universal Studios On the road Simon Pegg left Kristen Wiig Nick Frost and space alien ""Paul"" (a CGI character voiced by Seth Rogen) set out in search of adventure either on Earth or on other planets. EnlargeClose By Double Negative Universal Studios On the road Simon Pegg left Kristen Wiig Nick Frost and space alien ""Paul"" (a CGI character voiced by Seth Rogen) set out in search of adventure either on Earth or on other planets. And foul-mouthed. And unkempt. There will be no confusing Paul with E.T. -- or his film for that matter -- but the slacker alien has just enough snark and humor to lift the movie beyond its miscast Earthling stars. Rude sexist and fond of marijuana the title character of this sweet send-up of the Everygeek is a Shrek for the alien set. Paul knows the little-green-men cliches and is happy to lance them with an epithet and a belch. TRAILER Say hello to Paul Set in San Diegos annual nerd-fest Comic-Con Paul follows comic devotees Graeme (Simon Pegg) and Clive (Nick Frost) as they arrive from England to catch the convention before a road trip to Americas infamous UFO sites. Within minutes of the films opening the pair bump into Paul who has left Area 51 after discovering hes been a prisoner not a guest for the past 60 years. Theres not much back story offered We have no clue why Paul came to Earth from which planet he came or why he looks like an extra from the set of Pineapple Express. Suffice to say he clearly picked up behavior points by watching The Big Lebowski. This should be fish in a barrel for Pegg and Frost who cleaved the cop and zombie genres with Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead. Paul   1/2 out of four Stars Simon Pegg Nick Frost Bill Hader Director Greg Mottola Distributor Universal Pictures Rating R for language including sexual references and some drug use Running time 1 hour 40 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Here though they take oddly sincere roles. Pegg -- lonely limp-haired and looking dangerously like David Spade-- is happy to let Paul lead them on a cross-country trek to see Pauls outer-space pals. Frost has a stranger role as a comic geek who should be over the moon about his passenger but is sullen and jealous. Some performances feel tossed in particularly the one by the gifted Bill Hader whos reduced to a menacing man in black. And Jason Bateman can do corporate sleaze (Up in the Air) but action gunman isnt his forte. Where Paul takes off is in its embrace and knowledge of sci-fi icons. There are so many references to science-fiction classics including Star Wars Star Trek and Close Encounters of the Third Kind that a drinking game borne of the DVD seems a lock. And the space invader himself deserves some credit. Paul is slowed down by some silly action and special effects but the creatures movements facial expressions and interactions with human co-stars are seamless. Rogens vocal performance eclipses many of his latest live-action roles and if anything the alien could use a little more screen time. Its not out of this world but Paul is just spacey enough to convince us the truth is out there. And buzzed. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Comments (2) Paul Recommended Video Rated R  104 minutes  2011 Simon Pegg and Nick Frost the inspired British duo who spoofed horror movies in Shaun of the Dead and cop thrillers in Hot Fuzz star as sci-fi fanboys who arrive in the U.S. for a comic-book convention and piloting their RV through Area 51 pick up an escaped space alien with the voice of Seth Rogen. The script is a veritable cosmos of Spielberg in-jokes but the writer-stars also make room for some vicious and decidedly English digs at red-state shit-kickers and Christian fundamentalists. This is the first big Hollywood feature for Pegg and Frost and their two prior successes seem to have functioned as a supermagnet attracting not only the skilled comedy director Greg Mottola (Superbad Adventureland) but a supporting cast that could sustain two or three movies on its own (Kristen Wiig Jane Lynch Jeffrey Tambor Jason Bateman Bill Hader Blythe Danner Sigourney Weaver).

If Paul misses any prime targets its not for lack of trying.Its a collision of comedy cultures that turns out to be a cozy enough match. Frost and Pegg have won Stateside fans by sending up zombie movies (Shaun of the Dead) and police dramas (Hot Fuzz). Director Greg Mottola (Superbad) works with raunchy rapidly paced canvases of American youth in revolt. Everyone involved seems to view Close Encounters of the Third Kind as some kind of holy grail right down to the Devils Tower. (What no mashed potatoes?)Paul looks like the stereotypically gangly saucer-eyed alien that pop culture has fed us for years. Thats because hes been hanging out at a secret desert facility since the 50s helping propagate the spaceman image weve been served ad infinitum.Long assimilated Pauls become a regular dude who drinks smokes swears and wants to have a good time. Now hes in danger and our two Brits double outcasts by virtue of heritage and geekiness must traverse the Southwest and bring him to safety in a rented Winnebago.Brazenly silly and a bit too long for its material Paul subscribes to the theory that a dry-witted slacker alien behaving badly is a funny thing. As often as not thats right. The interspecies trio picks up a Bible-thumper (Kristen Wiig) who refuses to believe the spaceman is real giving the movie a bit of cosmological zing to go with the surplus of gags. Jason Bateman joins Mottola favorites Bill Hader and Joe Lo Truglio as federal agents on the trail of the visitor and his unlikely saviors.Paul gets pretty shaggy between gags; once the redefinition of ""alien"" is established the picture leans on its bawdy-as-we-want-be attitude a little too hard to sustain anything beyond fleeting pleasure. But its core audience should gobble it up like a case of Reeses Pieces.PaulB- Starring Simon Pegg Nick Frost Seth Rogen Jason Bateman Kristen Wiig Bill Hader Joe Lo Truglio Sigourney Weaver David Koechner and Blythe Danner.

Respectively the illustrator and the author of a graphic novel the lads are on a pilgrimage to Comic-Con in San Diego.After rubbing shoulders with Wookies and Sith lords the duo board an RV to visit UFO sacred sites such as Area 51 Roswell and Devils Tower. On their journey they are startled by E.T. in cutoffs. He wants to go home. The name of the bat-eared computer-generated figure is Paul. He smokes like a chimney swears like a sailor and snarks like Seth Rogen who supplies his voice.Pegg and Frost penned this comedy conceived by of and for the fanboys. For whatever reason it lacks the edge of their previous work. Is this because theyre working with a different director? Or because it doesnt successfully transplant British humor to U.S. soil? Their script which promises to be a tribute to the Spielbergian kind of science fiction ends up being a spoof of same. (There is a very good reason Paul so much resembles E.T. but as its the films one genuinely good joke I will not share it.)As directed by Greg Mottola (Adventureland Superbad) Paul provokes gentle giggles rather than explosive laughter. Prior Pegg/Frost outings were lightning-paced affairs directed by Edgar Wright who observes the principle that comedy requires speed.Mottola prefers a more leisurely pace. In his hands the comedy doesnt sprint it shambles. Because of the lethargic pace cheeky jokes become positively jowly. And the easy lampoons of rednecks and bible thumpers beg to be called ""Close Encounters of the secondhand.""The film has some consolations. Their names are Jason Bateman (as one of the men-in-black trying to find the alien in their midst) and Blythe Danner.Warning The R-rated Paul is not suitable for those under 14. It is crammed with gratuitous profanity that has the effect of making the movie less funny than it might have been.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

By Colin Covert Star Tribune March 17 2011 -- 211pm Video (2502)  Two aspiring comic-book creators with bad haircuts stumble upon a real live alien who has better social skills than they do. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint When youre really good at something the time comes when the ghosts of your earlier accomplishments are your toughest competition. The English comedy team Simon Pegg and Nick Frost who brilliantly satirized zombie movies in ""Shaun of the Dead"" and buddy-cop flicks in ""Hot Fuzz"" gave audiences huge laughs and gave themselves an extremely hard act to follow. The pairs third film ""Paul"" suffers by comparison. The film feels episodic haphazard more hit-and-miss onslaught than hilarious marksmanship. It pays homage to science fiction manhunts road movies stoner comedies and fanboy culture. The in-jokes come fast and scattershot citing ""Battlestar Galactica"" ""Aliens"" and all things Spielberg. The Vasquez Rocks featured in several ""Star Trek"" episodes make a cameo appearance. But the film loses it with strained references to ""Titanic"" ""The Blues Brothers"" and even the incest documentary ""Capturing the Friedmans."" The most crucial stumble however is structural. Rather than driving the story Pegg and Frost become bystanders in a story about a runaway extraterrestrial. Pegg and Frost play Graeme and Clive aspiring comic-book creators with bad haircuts limited social skills and a lot of T-shirts with comic-book motifs. They revel in the nerd nirvana that is Comic-Con then take an RV on the open road on a tour of UFO sites throughout the Southwest. The Englishmen feel a little alien in the United States but things get seriously weird near Area 51. Following a close encounter with a friendly little green man in a stolen government sedan the pair agree to assist his escape from the secret military compound where hes been confined for 60 years. Soon theyre on a life-and-death run from FBI Agent Zoil (Jason Bateman) angry rednecks and a vengeful daddy (John Carroll Lynch) whose daughter Ruth (Kristen Wiig) they have more or less kidnapped. The ensemble is not bad but they consign Pegg and Frost to the sidelines when they should be front and center. Courtesy Universal Pictures Universal Pictures Paul the alien voiced by Seth Rogen left and Simon Pegg have a series of close encounters in the Greg Mottola film ""Paul."" Missteps aside there are lots of good ideas packed into the movie. Cool dude Paul (voiced of course by Seth Rogen) is quite comfortable with human culture; hes more down-to-Earth than his British guardians. As he teaches them to shed their British reserve relax and live in the moment diffident Clive falls for Ruth a sheltered fundamentalist Christian whose world is upended by her encounter with extraterrestrial life. When Paul zaps Ruth with a vision of the universe that refutes her dogma she decides to break every commandment but cant get much beyond attempts to coin new swearwords. The culture clashes in this fish-out-of-water story are nicely handled too. The Brits who create comic books about three-breasted Martians nevertheless consider themselves ""men of science."" They regard the biblical literalists they encounter much the way Paul sees humans in general odd primates. The scripts saber-sharp atheist humor puts a nervy jolt of social satire in the mix. Yet viewers who know what happened to the Bibles Paul during his long-ago road trip will appreciate an added layer of irony in the film. And theres a sweetness of tone here that distinguishes ""Paul"" from the duos frenetically paced earlier work with director Edgar Wright. This time its American director Greg Mottola at the helm delivering the emotional grace notes that made his hit ""Superbad"" and his criminally underseen followup ""Adventureland"" such warm experiences. ""Paul"" brims with affection for its characters even as they become mere stick figures in a swirl of galloping breakneck action.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Movies Paul Review E.T. with a Potty Mouth Simon Pegg Nick Frost and Seth Rogen have amiable fun skewering sci-fi cliches but Paul never quite lives up to their talents By Richard Corliss March 17 2011 Share Read Later Double Negative / Universal Pictures Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture You have a friend whos famous for his dinner parties and this time he hosts a subpar soiree. The foods not as good as usual the wine is tres ordinaire the guests dont quite click. Thats the sort of disappointment that crept over me as I watched Paul the new comedy from Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. They play two English creators of fantasy comic books -- Graeme the writer (Pegg) and Clive the illustrator (Frost) -- who on a trip to Nevadas Area 51 befriend a four-foot-tall extraterrestrial named Paul. Back in England Pegg and Frost played the put-upon hero and the house doofus of two affectionate semibrilliant parody films Shaun of the Dead in 2004 and Hot Fuzz in 2007. Those movies which Pegg co-wrote with director Edgar Wright spurred a deep pool of good feeling for the trio especially among fans of zombie movies (Shaun) and Brit crime dramas (Hot Fuzz). Before that Pegg and Wright also collaborated on the Channel 4 domestic sitcom Spaced which boasted a charm level to match its high IQ. With Wright decamping to make Scott Pilgrim vs. the World Pegg and Frost came up with the script for Paul. How bad could this party be? Not bad but certainly not good; classify the movie as lazy fun. It goes for and occasionally achieves an amiable vibe that requires no particular wit or skill. Instead of Wright with his spring-coiled expertise at picture making Pegg and Frost settled for Judd Apatow stablemate Greg Mottola (Undeclared Superbad) the kind of director who doesnt think his job is to make things happen; rather he stands around and hopes things happen and when they dont he inserts a mouth-agape reaction from one of the characters or an actor falling backward to the ground as a visual rim shot to cue audience laughter. All you have to know about Paul is that the role of the alien is voiced by Seth Rogen in his jovial-stoner mode. When Pauls spacecraft crashed back in the 1940s the government kept him prisoner in Area 51 where he remained until he escaped into Graeme and Clives care after a road accident. Over the decades with nothing to do but answer questions from men in black and watch TV Paul became an expert in American cultural conspiracy. (Toking on some weed he remarks ""Im pretty sure this is the stuff that killed Dylan."" Graeme ""He isnt dead."" Paul with a knowing smile ""Isnt he?"") He was also an important source for the weavers of Hollywood fantasy. He takes credit for The X Files (""Mulder was my idea"") and for Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial. Anyway those two Steven Spielberg films served as the twin inspirations for Pauls plot of wayfarers on a quest to meet interplanetary travelers and of an alien stranded on Earth and needing civilian help to get him back home. Along the way to Pauls pickup spot he Graeme and Clive try to avoid three mysterious Feds (Bill Hader Joe Lo Truglio and Jason Bateman) and two vicious rednecks. They also adopt or possibly kidnap Ruth Buggs (Kristin Wiig) a Christian fundamentalist with a T-shirt that depicts Jesus shooting Charles Darwin. Its exactly the menagerie that foreigners like Graeme and Clive would expect to find in that huge crucial crazy and wonderful place called America -- at least Movie America. (See TIMEs Steven Spielberg covers.) Well leave for another time the question of how much the Hollywood mythos contributed to the worlds choice of America over the Soviet Union as a model to emulate and envy. (In short we had Bogie Marilyn and Animal House; they had movies about tractors.) But theres no question that locating the center of U.S. filmmaking in that geographic oxymoron -- a desert by the sea -- attracted filmmakers from all over the world and not just the German-speaking geniuses (Fritz Lang Billy Wilder Robert Siodmak) who were fleeing Hitler and needed a place to work. In 1969 alone three major European directors made movies in the American West Jacques Demy made Model Shop Agnes Varda made Lions Love and Michelangelo Antonioni made Zabriskie Point. The same year some homegrown Hollywood guys hatched Easy Rider another road movie about two guys who pick up a strange dude (though then it was Jack Nicholson). Paul is just the latest example of clever aliens heeding Americas siren call. These days of course our popular culture is instantly assimilated by everyone everywhere. The new Pegg-Frost film like Shaun of the Dead Hot Fuzz and Spaced is crammed with gaggy allusions to movies of all kinds from Capturing the Friedmans to Lorenzos Oil; but the inexhaustible touchstone is Hollywood sci-fi. The aliens name could be a tribute to George Pal producer of the pioneering SF films Destination Moon When Worlds Collide The War of the Worlds and Conquest of Space. Graeme and Clives visit to a Nevada roadhouse where John Williams Star Wars cantina theme is played underlines the actor-writers debt to George Lucas -- a connection made explicit in their new vidcast in which they play C-3PO and R2-D2 as the idiot descendants of Laurel and Hardy. Theres nothing either offensive or memorable about the movies R-rated humor -- its mostly mild frat language and boner jokes -- which can be synopsized by the shot of Paul in the front passenger seat of Graemes RV dropping trou and treating an adjacent driver to the spectacle of his gray butt. (Headline Alien Moons Earthling) But the movie deserves a short spanking for its misuse of two Saturday Night Live stalwarts. Wiig many of whose SNL characters (Penelope Gilly Shanna Dooneese) tend to hijack the skits theyre in gets to stretch a bit here but only to shift from the extremes of born-again zealotry to inept profanity; honestly thats the whole character. Hader is given even less to do in a word glower. Thats not the way for a gifted comic actor to spend his summer vacation. The movie is so inattentive to its main characters that it never thinks to have these obsessive creators of space-themed comic books ask Paul what its like where he comes from. But thats just further proof of the low bar Pegg and Frost have set for themselves. Even people who are naturally funny like these two are not always funny -- not at a dinner table and not in this slapdash confection of an alien comedy. See the 100 best movies of all time.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Shaun Of The Dead and Hot Fuzz Simon Peggs beloved collaborations with director/co-writer Edgar Wright are defined by an affection for the genres to which they lovingly pay homage. Pegg and regular collaborator Nick Frost--co-star of those Wright-directed films--have become geek heroes refashioning the art and entertainment of their childhood in their own image. That process continues with Paul a science-fiction comedy co-written by Pegg and Frost that radiates fond familiarity for E.T. Close Encounters Of The Third Kind and other heartwarming opuses about space aliens. (For extra geek-cred points the film even references Mac And Me the subgenres ultimate desecration.) With Paul Pegg Frost and director Greg Mottola (Superbad) play it both ways lightly spoofing messianic cinematic extraterrestrials like E.T. through its title character--a pot-smoking party-hearty space alien in a hurry to return home--while still gleaning wide-eyed wonder from everyday guys bonding with a visitor from another world. Pegg and Frost play exuberant Brits carrying out their lifes goal of attending nerd paradise Comic-Con before embarking on an epic exceedingly dorky tour of prominent UFO sites. Early in their journey they encounter a real-life alien (a CGI effect voiced by Seth Rogen) who is on the run from a glowering deadpan Men In Black-style operative (Jason Bateman) and a pair of bungling FBI agents (Bill Hader and Joe Lo Truglio). Kristen Wiig co-stars as a clean-living Bible-thumper who goes wild once Rogens wacky alien uses his powers to liberate her from fundamentalist dogma and unearth her buried love of exuberantly awkward profanity. Pegg and Frosts relationship is depicted with an almost homoerotic tenderness that doesnt always extend to other aspects of the film Wiigs character for example serves primarily as a vessel for cheap familiar cracks at organized religion and creationism. Paul is more slapdash than Shaun Of The Dead and Hot Fuzz but it shares many of those films virtues and underlying sweetness though the alien sometimes comes off as a Poochie-like exemplar of in-your-face attitude. Yet by the time it reaches an appropriately epic conclusion the film has earned its laughs as well as its big dramatic moments. Paul is a little sloppy and a little sappy but the filmmakers passion for their subject matter carries it over the occasional rough spot.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + In three movies the Englishmen Simon Pegg and Nick Frost created a new kind of comedy duo. Its true that their bodies fit neatly within the classic mold. Pegg is just south of lean. Frost is a sloppy orb. Otherwise the humor between them arises from a dynamic more organic than shtick. Theyre friends as opposed to rivals for an audience. Neither is the straight man. To that end the running gag in movie number three ""Paul which opens today is that their affection is so apparent that the dumb Americans they encounter assume theyre gay.The movie which Pegg and Frost wrote is a sleepy fiasco straining to achieve the same joy-buzzing soda-pop high of the zombie comedy ""Shaun of the Dead (2004) or the action farce ""Hot Fuzz (2007). Looking only at the title ""Paul is in trouble. It lacks the winking glee of the first two. So does the rest of the movie. Science fiction is the genre under reconsideration this time; and unlike the previous two films this one never achieves the exhilarating feat of exemplifying the types of Hollywood movies it wants to unpack. The airlines lost their luggage.Pegg and Frost have cast themselves as Graeme and Clive a pair of English tourists who follow the hallowed science-fiction convention Comic-Con with an RV road trip through the mythical alien locales of the Southwest. It was clear what the first two films hoped to achieve reverence and reconsideration. The new movie is a murkier affair. Its evident that Pegg and Frost share Graeme and Clives enthusiasm for ""Star Wars and ""Buck Rogers. They speak Klingon to each other the way lovebirds coo. And the movie works only when its protagonists can express ecstasy for this fantasy universe. When Buck Rogerss TV sidekick Twiki arrives for one packed event Clive experiences the same self-combustion American teens had watching the Beatles deplane at JFK.That sort of orgasm proves unsustainable for an entire narrative feature. But how dismaying that Clives smile rarely returns once the plot gets going. Thats partly a result of the woeful etchings of Frosts surprisingly solemn performance. Theres a bigger problem. Clive and Graeme wind up sharing their trip with the eponymous creature a vulgar pot-bellied cigarette-smoking stoner. Paul looks like a toy grown in a glass of tap water and sounds a touch like NBCs wise-ass alien ALF. The voice belongs to Seth Rogen whose husky sarcasm is even less appealing coming from someone elses body. Sitting before a campfire commenting on the joint hes holding Paul says ""This is the stuff that killed Dylan. Hes not dead says Graeme to which Paul replies ""Isnt he? Paul also claims to have inspired ""The X-Files and one flashback to 1980 puts him in a familiar-looking government warehouse as he smarmily advises Steven Spielberg over the telephone. You can see what the movie wants with the character to make the lost lovable space alien irreverent and cool. But thats not clever. Its ""ALF. Pauls wish to flee the feds and phone home upstages what for Clive was meant to be a platonically romantic getaway. It also derails the movies science-fiction hook and buries it with banal caricatures of redneck Bible-thumping rifle-blasting rubes one of whom (Kristen Wiig) is literally half-blind and rescued from her ignorance and sightlessness by two Brits and an extraterrestrial. (There are also parts for Jason Bateman Bill Hader Joe Lo Truglio Blythe Danner Jane Lynch Jon Carroll Lynch David Koechner and Sigourney Weaver.)This is the first Pegg-Frost comedy in which the director Edgar Wright didnt have a hand. You desperately miss his spark of visual wit and pure energy. Wright wrote ""Shaun of the Dead and ""Hot Fuzz with Pegg and directed both movies. Directing ""Paul is Greg Mottola an American whose movies include ""Superbad and ""Adventureland. Hes matte to Wrights gloss. You also dont know where in ""Paul his affections lie. They appear to be scattered all over the highway.Im sure it was obvious fun to mock stupid people Christian fundamentalists and homophobes. But the pile-ups shoot-outs and cast of loudmouthed hicks left me with the sinking feeling that the films true object of affection isnt science fiction but ""Cannonball Run. Hiring Weaver to play the movies monochromatically nasty villain suggests the filmmakers know she starred in ""Aliens but preferred her in ""Working Girl. It says everything about this movie that a few seconds after a brawl breaks out at a biker bar whose house band plays the ""Star Wars cantina song the action ducks outside for the less daunting challenge of gunplay and fainting. Its hard to imagine Wright resisting the opportunity to stage an entire sequence that tries to tweak and top George Lucas.Early in ""Paul theres a touching moment in which Graeme and Clive explain that this trip to America has long been their dream. Perhaps thats also true for Pegg and Frost. Now that its come true one hopes they return to their senses and realize that their comedy might be much better off at home.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

"Paul Take me to your dealer | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesPaul Take me to your dealerBrit filmmakers Simon Pegg and Nick Frost happily grease the slide for our descent into the nerd pool with their story of alien Paul.Simon Pegg and the extra terrestrial in Paul.  (Double Negative / Universal Studios)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. March 17 2011 Paul (out of 4) Starring Simon Pegg Nick Frost and the voice of Seth Rogen. Directed by Greg Mottola. 99 minutes. Opening Friday at major theatres. 14A The four-letter words fly in Paul but the one used most often is ""nerd."" Its fitting with a movie so lovingly dedicated to geek chic where the sci-fi in-jokes come so thick and fast you can cut through them with a light sabre. It sounded like the delighted dude in my row at Wednesday nights screening was going to explode from sheer joy as the references piled up. Perhaps it was the country and western band playing the Cantina band theme from Star Wars that tipped him over the edge. But its all good as Brit filmmakers Simon Pegg and Nick Frost happily grease the slide for our descent into the nerd pool with their story of Paul a diminutive potty-mouthed stoner alien who would have easily beaten E.T. senseless mid-call home and pocketed the quarter. Its not quite up to Peggs and Frostss Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz hilarity perhaps because the lads have hooked up with Superbads Greg Mottola instead of Edgar Wright the director of the two earlier and better efforts. But even though Paul doesnt quite make it to the top tier its a fitting addition to the duos canon which took on zombie and cop-buddy flicks and now turns to 70s and 80s movies about close encounters and stranded aliens with healing powers. Pasty Brit road trippers Graeme Willy (Pegg) and Clive Gollings (Frost) decide to put a cherry on the top of their weekend at Comic-Con in San Diego with an RV road trip through the valley of the geeks with Area 51 as their goal. Enter Paul with his pot belly hanging over his board shorts facility for foul language and slacker hero attitude courtesy of a voice provided by Seth Rogen. A guest of the feds since his spaceship crashed 60 years earlier hes outlived his usefulness to the U.S. government and the entertainment industry and is facing an unwanted cranium invasion. Hes on the lam and needs the nerds to get him to a rendezvous with his home planet homies. With a pair of bumbling G-men (Bill Hader and Jesse Plemons) in pursuit and stone-faced Men in Black acolyte Agent Zoil (Jason Batemen) refusing to give up the chase what every guys-on-the-lamb actioner needs is a willing gal and they find it in bible-thumping Ruth Buggs (Kristen Wiig). Before you can say ""Vulcan mind meld"" Paul has helped Ruth see the light and the formerly uptight missy starts spreading her wings by exploring the delights of foul language with a stream of hilarious non-sequitur swears. With cameos from Sigourney Weaver Jane Lynch Blythe Danner Jeffrey Tambor and even Steven Spielberg Paul moves along at a good 99-minute clip. More about the uncomplicated pleasures of sex drugs and rock n roll and the power of bros bonding amid a crisis Paul is a simple entertaining road-trip movie that doesnt ask us to do much more than strap in and enjoy the trip.

(Universal Pictures) Paul Paul is a comedy to phone home about BY JOE WILLIAMS  Post-Dispatch Film Critic  joewilliamspost-dispatch.com  314-340-8344 Mar 17 2011 (...) Wilson Webb Jason Bateman stars in the sci-fi comedy ""Paul."" (Universal Pictures) They say the truth is out there but if its anything like my recurring nightmare about an intrusive visitor I prefer the fiction of ""Paul."" This sci-fi comedy from the writers of ""Hot Fuzz"" and the director of ""Superbad"" is scabrously funny yet essentially gentle as the main thing that its probing is our collective ignorance.Co-writers Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are reunited as Graeme and Clive two likable British geeks who make a pilgrimage to Comic-Con in San Diego and then on to Nevada to ruminate about UFOs. On a dark desert highway near Area 51 they witness a car crash and are asked for a ride by the only survivor a big-headed gray-skinned little alien who calls himself Paul and speaks with the stoned demeanor of Seth Rogen (who provided the voice for the motion-capture animation).The disbelief is milked for all its worth. But after the nerds shock wears off Paul explains that his spaceship crashed on Earth 60 years earlier and that it took him this long to figure out he was a prisoner at the Air Force base not an honored guest. So now hes on the lam from the men in black two of whom are clueless goofballs (Bill Hader and Joe Lo Truglio) and one of whom will take no prisoners (Jason Bateman). While Paul and his eager new padawans are hiding at a remote RV park Graeme and Clive meet Ruth (Kristen Wiig a joy) who lives there with her protective pappy (John Carroll Lynch). When Ruth makes an innocent remark to smitten Graeme about her religious faith Paul reveals himself -- and the accumulated knowledge of the universe -- to freak her out.With a suddenly libidinous and foul-mouthed new comrade in tow the fugitives race toward an amusingly familiar UFO-rendezvous spot -- after a quick detour for Reeses Pieces. Pegg and Frost have a proven affection for American pop culture and here the irreverent allusions to the movies and comic books of the Spielberg-Lucas era work wonderfully. The chronic cussing isnt quite so effective but despite the cosmological musings in the script director Greg Mottola is aiming below the belt as much as hes aiming for the stars.

Paul Good Director Greg Mottola. Cast Simon Pegg Nick Frost Kristen Wiig Jason Bateman Blythe Danner. Rating R for language and drug use. Guide to this weeks new releases British pals Graeme (Simon Pegg) and Clive (Nick Frost) are visiting the United States to enjoy San Diegos Comic-Con. They plan to top off their holiday with an RV trip hitting such UFO-friendly sites as Area 51 and Roswell N.M. They are lovable nerds to the core; Graeme cheerfully plasters a bumper sticker that proclaims ""Alien on Board"" to the RV after one tourist stop. During their travels they encounter the title character. Paul is an alien who looks like something out of a Spielberg movie. Voiced by Seth Rogen in his typical vaguely stoned mode Paul chain smokes has a thing for toilet humor and enjoys dancing to Marvin Gaye. Paul is on the lam from government agents led by the hard-boiled Agent Zoil (Jason Bateman). It seems that the little visitor has existed in captivity for years but now has outlived his usefulness. The government wants to kill Paul to study his brain so hes searching for a way home. Graeme rips off the ""Alien on Board"" bumper sticker and the road trip suddenly gets more exciting. Frost and Pegg previously starred together in the wonderful ""Shaun of the Dead"" and the lesser overlong ""Hot Fuzz."" In terms of quality ""Paul"" falls somewhere in between those two. It is genial and often hilarious but there are also stretches that feel undercooked and strangely aimless. It could be that the guys simply set the bar so incredibly high with ""Shaun"" that anything less feels like a letdown. Pegg wrote the earlier films with Edgar Wright; this time he shares the duties with Frost. That could explain why the supporting characters arent as fleshed-out as they could be. Agent Zoil is a scream and Kristen Wiig scores as a fundamentalist Christian named Ruth Buggs but then you get fine actors like Jane Lynch and Blythe Danner stuck playing cartoonish roles that add nothing to the mix. But in its best moments ""Paul"" achieves what the guys set out to do in their earlier movies It simultaneously pays loving tribute to a film genre while standing on its own as entertainment. Even if you dont pick up on all the in-jokes that are tossed around you wont feel - pardon the pun - alienated. Pegg and Frost are also so endearing that its hard to hold too much against ""Paul."" The movie never mocks its fanboy heroes; they are treated with an affectionate respect and those sweet-natured vibes are present throughout the whole film. ""Paul"" isnt a great film but it sure is a fun one. Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

Im referring of course to Simon Pegg and Nick Frost the two clever British goofballs who co-wrote and costar in their latest finger-painted love letter to American pop culture. Having previously captured the spirit of our peoples zombie flicks and cop/buddy pics in Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz the two lads set their coordinates to E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial. And with a flourish they call an homage to Steven Spielberg the pair assume the roles of Graeme Willy (Pegg) and Clive Gollings (Frost) man-boy geeks bonded in their love of all things on exhibit at Comic-Con. Graeme and Clive are thrilled beyond measure to be on US of A soil Not only do they attend Comic-Con but they also rent an RV to tour some of the sci-fi shrines of the UFO-friendly Southwest. Its there on a stretch of dusty road and kitschy signage that theyre flagged down by an actual ET all big (CGI) head and spidery fingers -- just like in the pictures. His name is Paul and voiced by Seth Rogen (back in form and liberated by invisibility) he speaks excellent stoner English. Paul has been hanging around the area since he crash-landed in a farmers field some 60 years ago and a little girl befriended him before the feds took him away. For decades Paul served as a consultant to world leaders and Hollywood suits (The X-Files Agent Mulder was his idea). But now those same feds are thinking of terminating him. Having escaped their custody Paul just wants to get back to his ship. And he hopes that Graeme and Clive will give him a lift. Its here that Paul the movie finally finds its own shambling syncopated rhythm. Because in the beginning when the boys wander the Comic-Con convention floor the films comedy gears dont yet mesh. We can hear the grinding as the U.K. stars and their awesomely American director Greg Mottola (Superbad) attempt to broaden their comedy appeal for a bigger Hollywood studio budget. But then around the time the pilgrims pull into an RV park and Graeme is gobsmacked by love at the first sight of Ruth the demure psalm-quoting creationist daughter of the religious park manager (John Carroll Lynch) Pauls comic road map starts to make sense. (SNLs Kristen Wiig gives one of her best most endearing character transformations as Ruth.) Here in the desert surrounded by a made-in-America possibility of reinvention two visitors taste freedom with the help of a foulmouthed 420-friendly little alien dude who loosens them up. Meanwhile the filmmakers offer up a spot-on cartoon of types weve loved in dozens of other movies the grim special agent on a Mulderian mission (Jason Bateman possessor of a ridiculously funny character name); his dimmer underlings (Bill Hader and Joe Lo Truglio); the more coffee honey? diner waitress (Jane Lynch); the Spielbergian little girl all grown up (Blythe Danner a fine comedian stealing her scenes); and on a throne of honor the sinister mastermind behind the plan to off Paul -- played by none other than Sigourney Weaver queen of Alien/Avatar/Galaxy Quest/Ghostbusters and everything else that she surveys. Graeme and Clive representatives of a nation of nonbelievers in UFOs and big dinner portions come to the psychic capital of a country that wants to believe and theyre transformed. In Paul Simon Pegg and Nick Frost do likewise in celebration of what the Spielbergian cosmos is all about.

Note the one key missing element Edgar Wright who directed and co-wrote with Pegg both the 2004 zom-com Shaun of the Dead and 07s Hot Fuzz in which Pegg and Frost re-enacted at least one scene from every buddy-cop and Chuck Norris movie ever made. Greg Mottola instead directs Paul and hes an escapee from Judd Apatows stable having done several Undeclared episodes leading up to his Superbad night out with Jonah Hill and Michael Cera whose Arrested Development Mottola also worked on.Consider this the ultimate modern-comedy crossover as damp a dorks dream as when Superman teamed up with Spider-Man or when Captain Kirk met Captain Picard in Star Trek Generations among the approximately 382 films referenced in Paul. But Wrights absence is notable and moreover noticeable--for reasons so subtle they almost dont matter but which are so evident that they finally render Paul lightweight and less than essential unlike Shaun and Hot Fuzz which entertain no matter how many times you see them. Its the difference between parody and tribute--between Spaceballs and Galaxy Quest.Shaun is nothing less than a canonical zombie film; Hot Fuzz is a terrific shoot-em-up-stack-em-up. Theyre top entries in their respective genres not mere nods of reverence to the tower of reels upon which they were constructed. Paul however is a sci-fi movie spoof half its dialogue consisting of lines lifted from Star Wars Close Encounters of the Third Kind Star Trek Raiders of the Lost Ark Aliens Back to the Future and all the other 70s and 80s sci-fi comfort-food staples fed to growing fanboys back then. And its plot is pure E.T. An alien who has phoned home needs the help of humans to meet his ride.But in this case the alien is a shirtless foul-mouthed dope-smoking ass-flasher named Paul voiced by Seth Rogen. Paul looks like every alien throughout popular culture-- bulbous noggin wide-screen eyes rail-thin frame--because as it turns out hes the original pop-cult prototype. As he explains after he crash-landed on earth in 1947 and wound up in government captivity Pauls likeness was marketed via moving pictures and literature in order to get people used to his image should there ever be an actual alien invasion. And hes no E.T. rip-off man; thats his life story down to his gig as Steven Spielbergs uncredited consultant.Frost and Pegg (Scotty) are Pauls ideal chaperones They are respectively stalled-out sci-fi novelist Clive Gollings and his illustrator/best friend Graeme Willy traveling across the ""extraterrestrial highway"" in the Southwest desert in an RV as part of a holiday that begins at Comic-Con in San Diego. Who better to escort an extraterrestrial cross-country than nerds who want to believe (speaking of Mulder and Scully were also Pauls invention)?Theyre chased by Men in Black among them Jason Bateman (as Agent Lorenzo Zoil one among dozens of cheap gags) and Bill Hader who receive their instructions from a faceless voice on the other end of the phone. (Its Sigourney Weaver which spoils nothing unless youve never heard her speak.) Along the way the trio encounters a True Believer of a different stripe Ruth Buggs (Kristen Wiig) a cycloptic Creationist who runs an RV park with her devout daddy in the middle of nowhere. Wiigs the revelation here A screeching sketch artist she brings rare depth and genuine warmth to the thankless one-dimensional role of a God-fearing Bible-thumper. Her scenes with Paul--when he reveals to her the size of the universe or introduces her to the simple pleasures of a well-used expletive--are more rewarding than those that the alien shares with Pegg and Frost. Only then does the movie transcend parody and stop being a game of Spot the Reference becoming its own singular creation.Thats not to dismiss Pauls simple pleasures--if nothing else its fondness for sex and drugs and four-letter words rescues its references from the soft hands of wee ones into which theyve fallen of late. (Sci-fi cons for those who havent attended one recently are as filled with three-foot-tall Darth Vaders as they are adult-size models.) This is the smart-ass stoners E.T. the movie the fanboy parent wont be able to hand down like some tattered squeaky-clean memento to their action-figure-collecting kids. Its just not quite right without Wright who could have helped Frost and Pegg stuff Mel Brooks back into their Han Solo Underoos.

By Anthony Lane Aaron Eckhart takes on aliens in Jonathan Liebesmans new movie.   Credit Photograph by RICHARD CARTWRIGHT / SONY PICTURES You have to hand it to Aaron Eckhart. Back in 2000 he found himself up against Julia Roberts at her most buccaneering in ""Erin Brockovich."" Last year in ""Rabbit Hole"" he went head-to-head with Nicole Kidman who was in full lamentation mode. And now just as he was hoping for a quiet life he gets blitzed by merciless invaders from outer space in ""Battle Los Angeles."" Does the man have no fear? The new film directed by Jonathan Liebesman assigns Eckhart the role of Staff Sergeant Nantz who is nearing the end of twenty years in the Marine Corps. After a difficult tour of Iraq he is in Los Angeles with the Second Battalion Fifth Marines. His final duty is to assist with an evacuation; there are meteor showers off the coast and people are freaking out. In a nice touch the meteors are reported to be slowing down before impact which means that somebody or something with feet is hitting the brakes. Shortly afterward extraterrestrial shock troops--organic-mechanical monsters described as ""an infestation of God knows what""--swarm up the beaches blazing away at anything that moves. They are said to lack air support which seems peculiar if you can stream across desolate reaches of the cosmos you should as a rule be able to rustle up a couple of choppers. And so in due course the alien craft arrive tetchy pilotless drones in the shape of pizzas from which individual slices peel off to launch spicy deep-crust attacks on defenseless mortals. All of which is a problem for Nantz and his platoon who have been sent to rescue civilians trapped in the West Los Angeles police station. From there one of the marines hot-wires a bus (""Hes from Jersey"" the explanation goes) and the group heads for the freeway in search of safety. The first of these setups is a nod to ""Assault on Precinct 13"" while the second pays crunching tribute to ""Speed"" but neither homage causes the film to stop and admire itself. Liebesman just keeps things rolling and there is a silly but rich satisfaction in watching men of arms--or a woman of arms in the case of Tech Sergeant Santos (Michelle Rodriguez) who has hitched a ride with the marines--grow ever more resourceful as the fight proceeds. By way of a rebuff to the robotic slavish activity of their foe they get to prove their human handiness not least when Santos and her new pals defying our expectation of a gargantuan nuclear strike end up bayonetting the enemy at close quarters as if this were a Belgian trench in 1917. Rodriguez who began her career with ""Girlfight"" (2000) and has never looked back seems almost comically in her element here. Indeed given her track record onscreen and off she may not even have realized she was in a movie at all. Politically the film is calculated to a tee. The real America remains in the claws of two foreign conflicts that have been morally and practically contentious from the start so what can fictional Americans do to heal or temporarily conceal such wounds? The answer is to engage a hostile force that can be assailed with impunity and without division or debate; to be blunt its not possible to commit atrocities against extraterrestrials. Against one maybe if he gets stranded in a forest but not against a throng. Liebesman scorns the slow burn that prevailed to the north in San Francisco where Philip Kaufmans ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" made it hard for us even to gauge who the aliens were so cunningly did they entomb themselves in our physiques. As for ""The Birds"" the best film ever made about the threat of the inhuman on the West Coast Hitchcock left us in a rustle of uncertainty about everything--the trigger for the attack the motive and the prospect of peckings to come. ""Battle Los Angeles"" by contrast could not be clearer what these critters need is water. They plan to colonize our planet erase its pesky inhabitants and harvest the H?O. Fair enough but couldnt they have tried asking? Its not even clear how this full-scale aquaculture was meant to work. Peering carefully at the screen I couldnt see a single alien who had remembered to bring a bucket although one of them does get more than he bargained for when a rookie marine in the back yard of an abandoned family home fires from close range and knocks the intruder into the swimming pool. Note how that sequence the spookiest in the film unfolds with barely a word. Would that the whole movie had followed its lead. Near the beginning Nantz is seen running along the seashore and being outsprinted with ease by his own men. We then get a labored conversation between him and his superior ending with ""Youre expired"" and adding nothing to what we have just witnessed. This establishes Liebesmans equation a lively visual shorthand interspersed with lumps of dying dialogue. The credits list Christopher Bertolini as the author of the script but most of it seems to have been devised by a basic screenwriting app ""Give this letter to my wife"" ""Id go to Hell and back for you sir"" and best of all from Nantz to an orphaned boy ""I need you to be my little marine."" In flashback we are introduced to each member of the platoon (the nervous new lieutenant the father-to-be and so forth) and this results much later in an exchange between Nantz and the brother of a marine who died under his command. The staff sergeant delivers a long encomium to the dead and then says briskly ""None of that matters right now"" to gleeful sniggers from the audience. If it doesnt matter why include it? I cant think of a single viewer adult or kid who will see this film and feel better or wiser for that scene and I cant help wishing that Liebesman had played to his strengths stripped down the talk to military orders alone cut all backstories as if cancelling all leave and allowed his characters to express themselves in action as they themselves would prefer. In the words of Staff Sergeant Nantz ""Heavy shit is highly overrated."" ""Battle Los Angeles"" is a lot more fun than bludgeoning soul-draining follies like ""Terminator Salvation"" or the ""Transformers"" films and with a decisive trim it could truly have fulfilled its brief as a bright semi-abstract pop fantasy at once excitable and disposable. Oddly it did once exist in that form in the first trailer shown months ago which featured no talking at all and no shouting either--just a silent montage of mayhem overlaid with the twang of a plaintive electro-soundtrack. If Liebesman wanted to make a work of art why didnt he simply release the teaser and leave it at that? As shown by ""Battle Los Angeles"" and hordes of films before it science fiction is nothing if not mockable. The very extravagance of its imaginings lays it wide open to the crowing delight of a movie such as ""Paul."" Directed by Greg Mottola it was written by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost who also star as a pair of hapless British dorks named Graeme Willy and Clive Gollings. They visit San Diego to attend Comic-Con like pilgrims journeying to Santiago de Compostela and then rent an R.V. to tour those hot spots beloved of U.F.O.logists--Area 51 and the rest. And then they meet an alien. His name is Paul and he is voiced by Seth Rogen which tells you immediately that he is not the cutie from beyond. He has a few magic powers such as resurrecting the dead but having languished in confinement for decades on Earth and finally escaped he has soaked up the worst of our habits. He drinks he curses he smokes both cigarettes and weed and he wears shorts slung dangerously low. Now that is not a bad joke on which to start building a movie; unfortunately in the case of ""Paul"" it is the only joke. Once you have seen the little gray man mooning through the window you kind of get the point and the film makes his ribaldry contagious. Everybodys talk turns blue with skilled performers like Jason Bateman and Kristen Wiig joining in and adding to the scent of desperation. What happened here? I yield to no one in my joy at Frost and Peggs earlier films ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" which also thrived on parody and stung with satirical precision. But they were set in England whereas ""Paul"" adrift in foreign territory feels at once secondhand in its eagerness and unknowing in its scorn. The secondary figures look especially thin; just as I was thinking Oh well at least the writers havent resorted to some crazy-eyed trailer-park Bible-thumper toting a shotgun in came Moses Buggs (John Carroll Lynch). More vexing though is the thought that science fiction is so inherently close to the absurd that the toughest challenge is not to lampoon it--as movies like ""Galaxy Quest"" have done before and as Mottola does here with his blatant gestures to ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""E.T.""--but to play it straight as Spielberg managed to do. Only thus can we probe to borrow a key verb from the aficionados the ridiculous for the sublime those terrors or unlikely consolations that lurk within.

Part bromance part sci-fi spoof and all a bit disappointing ""Paul"" hits the road with two English nerds on vacation (Simon Pegg and Nick Frost ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"") who befriend a hard-partying alien from outer space (voiced by Seth Rogen). In theory Rogen and helmer Greg Mottolas laconic stoner style shouldve meshed well with the Brits tongue-in-cheeky approach. In practice the cogs jam somewhat resulting in fitfully funny but anodyne entertainment. Nevertheless pic did stellar biz (well over 8 million) in its first week in Blighty and could perform solidly Stateside when it opens March 18. Visiting Comic-Con in San Diego aspiring illustrator Graeme Willy (Pegg) and wannabe sci-fi writer Clive Gollings (Frost) are in geek heaven especially when they meet their idol Adam Shadowchild (Jeffrey Tambor in a droll cameo). After the convention they take a road trip in a rented RV planning to visit all the Southwests most famous UFO hot spots from Nevadas Area 51 to Roswell N.M. En route they almost collide with another car that runs off the road. The driver turns out to be laidback dude-from-another-planet Paul who with his huge eyes massive head and spindly body looks exactly like the classic small gray aliens of yore -- apart from his cargo shorts that is. Assuring Graeme and Clive that hes in trouble and needs help and promising that he has no intention of anally probing them Paul hitches a ride. Action cuts between the guys in the RV and Pauls pursuers another trio made up of hardass Agent Zoil (Jason Bateman) and two goofy rookies Haggard (Bill Hader) and OReilly (Joe Lo Truglio) whose own development is just as arrested as Graeme and Clives. Although it transpires that Paul is on his way to rejoin his mothership theres little sense of urgency as he Graeme and Clive make pit stops along the way. Tension is generated only by whether or not someone else will glimpse Paul; at one stop Clive becomes smitten with Ruth Buggs (Kristen Wiig) a shy sheltered fundamentalist Christian with a clouded eye and they end up kidnapping her in the nicest possible way when she accidentally spots the alien. One of the winning things about Peggs scripts for ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" (which he co-wrote with helmer Edgar Wright) was the way they managed to riff on the genres they spoofed while still delivering sympathetic reasonably rounded characters particularly ones whose heroics were undercut by their exaggeratedly mild English manners. The screenplay for ""Paul"" credited to co-stars Pegg and Frost sticks largely to the same formula but the transplant to American soil hasnt proved quite as fertile. Despite a few laugh-out-loud moments the hit-miss ratio is lower this time around perhaps due to Wrights absence. Although the gags never push film in-jokes to the absurd levels of the ""Scary Movie"" franchise and its ilk sometimes the nudges (such as numerous references to Steven Spielberg who literally phones in a cameo) serve to show off the filmmakers range of references rather than to further the story. Meanwhile the edgy-slackerish sensibility Rogen and Mottola might have been expected to bring to the party lacks the spontaneity of their previous collaborations ""Superbad"" and TV series ""Undeclared."" Certainly this feels like a bit of a regression for Mottola taking on a studio work-for-hire after his underrated indie ""Adventureland"" while Rogen constrained by a more-or-less voice-only perf (his movements and expressions have been replicated somewhat for Pauls animation) sounds like hes on autopilot. Its Wiig who impresses most here with a bravura display of comic timing and some of the filthiest lines in the film (once she learns to cuss Ruth goes at it with a vengeance). Her characters sudden disavowal of intelligent design and embrace of hedonism is clunkily written but the thesp manages to put it across with verve. Pic is executed with pro polish. Combo of CGI and puppetry to create the charmingly designed Paul is seamless although the thesps dont always convincingly pretend that theyre interacting with a character they can actually see instead of a tennis ball on a stick to create eyeline matches.

Not just yet but if it was a cardigan - and lets face it this is cosy comedy - the elbows would be going. The pair follow up their smash send-ups Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz (which starred both and Pegg co-wrote) with an affectionate ribbing of sci-fi and get-the-alien-to-the-mothership movies. There are plenty of giggly gags but also a hint of diminishing returns.This is a US-UK comedy alliance with Seth Rogen as the voice of Paul a CGI alien on the run from the FBI (the CGI and live-action combo works fine) who comes across like a Pixar character who smokes weed and tells jokes about genitals. Director Greg Mottola (Superbad) replaces Edgar Wright with co-writers Pegg and Frost acting out their usual male-hetero-romance dynamic as nerds who get more than they bargain for when they run into Paul on a tour of UFO hotspots.The whole thing capers along rolling in chase movie pastiches by the end the trio has a Bible thumper two rednecks and the FBI on their tail. There are plenty of jokes for Brits and liberal Americans but transported to America some of the idiosyncratic fondness of the earlier films is lost. A couple of gags are weak too the pair are continually mistaken for a gay couple snore. But there is enough sly humour and cracking one-liners (yes some about anal probes) to make Paul a shrewdly timed alt-Valentines Day movie.

Its definitely a step down from the previous two films - but it still has some funny moments. I cant help thinking that it is not as witty as the previous two films because it has far more of an American influence.

Daily Edition Login to download Paul Film Review 1143 AM PST 2/7/2011 by Ray Bennett FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Universal A sci-fi spoof for everyone with funny encounters that will require close attention. TWITTER Directed by ""Superbad"" helmer Greg Mottola the film -- which premiered at SXSW -- also features Kristen Wiig Jason Bateman and Sigourney Weaver. LONDON -- There are so many references to science-fiction films and comic book characters in Universals affectionate funny and action-packed sci-fi spoof Paul that there should be a prize for anyone who gets them all. Simon Pegg who teamed with Edgar Wright to write the wonderful zombie spoof Shaun of the Dead and the much admired shoot em up horror lark Hot Fuzz here partners with co-star Nick Frost to script a comedy creature feature that hits home with wit invention and flare. With great gags lots of clever little moments and a winning almost-human story at the center to leaven the big action sequences the film should please devoted fans of the genre with its savvy attention to detail. But also it should appeal to those who generally can take or the leave the genre which it treats with cheerful disrespect. Box-office riches lie in wait as it is exactly the kind of film that fans will want to see more than once. The picture gets down to business briskly with Pegg as Graeme and Frost as Clive best mates from England on a dream trip to the United States that begins at San Diegos Comic-Con ahead of a tour of the most famous UFO sites. Genial and naive they eat up Comic-Con where Jeffrey Tambor delivers a devastating portrayal of an aging comic creator before they set off in a RV headed for the desert. Somewhere along the Extraterrestrial Highway they run into Paul. Seth Rogen voices the title character a laid-back weed-smoking E.T. on the run from a U.S. government agency that has kept him prisoner for 60 years. After some persuasion Graeme and Clive agree to help Paul get to where he can be rescued and taken back to his home planet. Men in black rednecks and fundamental Christians are the main heavies that get in the way of their plans. The writers populate the lavishly photographed American West with several weird and wonderful characters. Sigourney Weaver is the mostly unseen voice of the head of the agency that wants to see whats in Pauls brain with Jason Bateman as her ruthless man on the case. Kristen Wiig spouts scripture as an impressionable clerk at an RV camp who finds salvation thanks to Pauls evolutionary wisdom and Graemes love while John Carroll Lynch carries a Bible and a shotgun as her angry father. Theres a pair of dangerously ham-fisted agents and a couple of belligerent truck-driving cowboys also on their tail. Director Gregg Mottola (Superbad Adventureland) encourages Lawrence Shers cinematography and David Arnolds score to be as witty and intelligent as the script with pictures and music that evoke and tease the classics of science fiction with the same invention. Meanwhile the alien is all head big shiny eyes and gangly limbs a first-class CGI creation that fits seamlessly into the film. With secure spots in the Star Trek and Mission Impossible franchises and The Adventures of Tintin The Secret of the Unicorn coming up Pegg is now an established star with a patented mix of good-guy innocence and street smarts. Frosts slacker buddy routine can become tiresome but he shows good comic timing and handles deftly several gags about whether Clive and Graeme are gay. Rogens nonchalant smart-ass delivery is perfect for a cool outer-space dude and Wiig has the required sweetness and prettiness to deal with a young woman whose liberation leads her to become an ill-advised potty-mouth. Theres lots of bad language in the film all of it for comic effect but constant nonetheless. Christianity gets in the neck which could hurt Bible-belt box office and some of the action becomes a bit serious. Its all in good spirit though and many of the jokes are priceless.
