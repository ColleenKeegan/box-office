""Most men reek of fear"" says the Master Vampire (Charles Dance). ""In you I smell hope."" Vlad (Luke Evans) the King top fighter and undisputed hunk of Transylvania does have a desperate hope that he can defeat the invading Turks of the Ottoman Empire. So the Master Vampire (Charles Dance) offers to bestow all the infernal powers of his species on Vlad. And in a kind of infomercial twist on Faust hell get a free three-day trial. The small print If in that time Vlad surrenders to the insatiable lust for human blood--the vampires most delicious addiction--he is doomed to become a monarch of the eternal undead. No refunds. Dracula Untold means not only to upend the charnel image of Bram Stokers vampire but also to give a sweet sheen to the legend of Vlad ""The Impaler"" Dracula the Wallachian king whose name Stoker borrowed for his novel. Known as a sadistic warrior who left his victims piked on spikes like scarecrows in a cemetery Vlad gets a bio-makeover comparable to turning Englands Richard III another 15th-century king of fearsome rep into Henry V. This origins story directed by Gary Shore and written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless (all first-timers in feature films) casts Vlad as a loving husband a protective father and a national hero--Vladimir the Redeemer. Thats right Dracula is a little bit Jesus. Like the Christian Messiah Vlad spends part of his childhood in a foreign land (not Egypt but Turkey) before maturing into an idealist and a freedom fighter. Choosing to die--to be undead--for the salvation of his people Vlad endures a Calvary of sacrifice and spends the requisite three days between Crucifixion and Resurrection. The difference is that for him the resurrection as a vampire in training comes first. Hell pay later. Intended as the launching of a film franchise--the movies last line is ""Let the games begin""--Dracula Untold grossed a tidy 23.5 million on its opening weekend in North American theaters. It has also earned about 63 million in its release abroad. Most reviewers slammed the movie but its not nearly as awful or offal as its critical odor. If Untold isnt exactly must-see big-screen fare it would be a welcome companion on a long flight or as a rainy-day Netflix rental. The big shock if you were expecting a typical Dracula story is that this not a horror film. You show up for the predatory pestilence of F.W. Murnaus Nosferatu or the toxic love bites of Park Chan-wooks Thirst--to cite the two vampire films on the all-TIME Top 25 Horror Movies list--and instead find a stately epic in the Sword and (Satanic) sorcery genre. Hewing with fair fidelity to the Vlads story as recounted by historians (or at least Wikipedians) the script recounts his adolescent years in the Ottoman court where his father had sent him as a prince-captive and his long battle as a leader of the Christian crusade that Pope Pius II had ordered against against the Muslim invaders. When the Turkish king Mehmed II (Dominic Cooper) demands that Vlad hand over a thousand boys as soldiers for the Empire including his young son Ingeras (Art Parkinson) he refuses. Thats when Vlad makes his deal with the demon. It gives him the strength to singlehandedly defeat an army of thousands--whose soldiers courteously wait until hes slaughtered one bunch before attacking him--and it creates an aura that will scare other troops. As he cogently observes ""Men do not fear swords. They fear monsters."" Very well for God and country hell be one. The Transylvanian monks first mount the worlds fastest insurrection then try to contain Vlad when they note those telltale vampire signs fear of sunlight and the avoidance of gleaming silver. As the third of his free-trial nights nears its end Vlads wife Malena (Sarah Gadon) learns of his deal just before she is to die at Ottoman hands. Like any good spouse she insists he drink her blood for the strength he needs to defeat his foe. So Vlads transformation into vampire isnt an act of infernal craving. Its what he did for love. The battles are robust but mostly bloodless; in a PG-13 action film you see a weapons thrust not its impact. This is no Game of Thrones (also shot in Ireland also costarring Dance (as Tywin Lannister). To extend the Jesus metaphor its more a Crown of Thorns. But cinematographer John Schwartzman finds strong subtle tones in all the nighttime battles and photographs everyone to look great -- even when theyre supposed to look bat-split ugly like Dance. The actor under his CGI makeup has creepy majesty as the demon whos grown long of tooth (and claw). And Gadon the Canadian actress who played a teen victim of vampirism in The Moth Diaries is both pure and sexy in the sort of role -- faithful wife with heaving bosom -- that Hazel Court so often took in old Hammer horror films. Evans the Welshman who made solid early screen impressions as Apollo in Clash of the Titans and as the rustic stud in Tamara Drewe carries Untold by admirably fulfilling the two essential functions of a period-movie hero to enunciate comic-book dialogue with Shakespearean authority and to look great with his shirt off. Any viewer male or female would be happy to meet him in a dark cave and give him a free three-day trial. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

"Mistrial and Error RDJs Messy The Judge and the Highs and Lows of Whats New This Week << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Mistrial and Error RDJs Messy The Judge and the Highs and Lows of Whats New This Week Movies October 10 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print At least a dozen movies are opening around the country this week. More than half of them are in The Judge. Not different genres per se just different movies. Theres the one in which greasy careerist Hank Palmer (Robert Downey Jr.) puts the brakes on lucrative defense-lawyering in order to be good and folksy; theres the one in which he returns to his small Indiana hometown and winds up defending his estranged father -- Judge Joe Palmer (Robert Duvall) -- in a murder case. Theres the one in which he resumes flirtation with his high school flame Samantha (Vera Farmiga) the Cool-Girl Ex Who Never (Ever) Left Town and the one in which he and his equally estranged brothers Glen (Vincent DOnofrio) and Dale (Jeremy Strong) bond over their mothers recent death. And thats not even accounting for the movie about the widowed judge himself whos secretly ailing requiring snobby Hank to play caregiver. Is there time to mention the movie about Hanks nasty divorce and relationship with his only-in-the-movies adorable tweenage daughter (Emma Tremblay) whos never met Grandpa? More Awards SeasonAll of our Oscar coverage These stories could work in a single film. But in The Judge they dont. The studio knows this. A baffled friend has been sending me notes for weeks about how each TV ad is for a new movie. The only thing all these parts of the finished product have in common is Downey who glides into each sequence as though the previous one hasnt happened. Hank is smug and testy. As he hops into his sports car bound for his mothers funeral he berates his soon-to-be ex-wife for cheating on him. His put-downs are mean but chummy. Then as he drives off from his modernist glass-and-metal fortress his tone changes in response to a plea from the wife. ""You wanna do something for me Water the fucking hydrangeas"" Back home in fictional Carlinville Hank basically gets amnesia when it comes to the hurt hes caused everyone in his past. But to be fair they dont seem to care -- theyre just so glad hes back Within minutes of walking into Samanthas waterfront restaurant (please dont make me tell you what its called)1 Downeys being bathed in whatever moonlight is spilling off Farmiga Its as if theyve always been together. No one can hold a grudge against Hank because theyre already carrying his water. The Judge is maddening and this is mostly why. There is no reason to like Hank. As a professional hes an asshole. As a man hes a brat. But the movie keeps stacking the scenes in his favor. Even when hes wrong he gets the last word. Watching Downey patronize his family and condescend to the goober attorney (Dax Shepard) that Judge Joe initially hires I had the same feeling I did seeing Tom Cruise swoop into town and outwit everybody in Jack Reacher -- the locals are mostly portrayed as dim and parochial even tough lunar-lit Farmiga. Theres a brief moment when Hank receives his comeuppance from Judge Joe. But thats not permitted to stand. The fathers health is rigged so that the son retains the compassionate upper hand. Most of The Judge is built on rough sketchy writing (credited to Nick Schenk and Bill Dubuque). (You know the movies in the creative basement when your hear that the no-nonsense prosecuting attorneys name is Dwight Dickham played by Billy Bob Thornton.) Theres a stab at sex farce and several whacks at family tragedy. But the director David Dobkin (Wedding Crashers) cant do much with apples and oranges except find a banana to add to the mix. If an audience goes for this movie -- there was big laughter and some sniffling the night I saw it -- thats due to Downeys charisma. But his arrogance is miscalibrated here. Its impossible to be a withering snob and a saint who suffers; to be Albert Brooks and Jack Lemmon. Other stars can do more appealing peacocks George Clooney and Brad Pitt come with a moral core; Denzel Washington gets away with being better than you because well he is and part of whats better is his sexiness. But those men can laugh at themselves. Downeys shtick is really just laughing at the people around him. Whats funny to most Downey characters is that were not him. That persona is the engine of the Iron Man movies. Not only is his sleazy billionaire richer than we are hes also demonstrably more brilliant and puts that brilliance to superheroic use. When Downey stars in other movies like this one and Due Date hes just a defensive bitterly sarcastic version of his trust-fund burnout in Less Than Zero. That sort of adolescent entitlement is where the movies are right now. Its as if no one has any trust -- in the material the audience themselves -- to tell one story in an absorbing complicated way. Some of this is the direct result of what happens when too many grown-ups have moved into fantasyland. No one knows what an adult looks like or how an adult behaves because no one wants to be one. Some of it is the preponderance of television in our lives. Shapeless lawless beholden seemingly to no one television as an entity is everywhere and everything. The movies feel beholden to it. The clanging plots and sloppy ideas and overpopulated underutilized casts the muscle-pulling pivots from comedy to drama seriousness to schmaltz This Is Where I Leave You and Men Women amp; Children and now The Judge all feel like TV that television wouldnt want. Whatever is happening with Hollywood movies at the moment you can feel it in The Judge. Its not that it doesnt know what kind of movie to be. Its that it wants to be many movies and fails at being even one of them. Hanks been dredged in a batter of glibness then deep-fried in a vat of need. One of the storys father-son showdowns can be accurately reduced to I needed a hug and you never gave me one. Its embarrassing to see the filmmakers trying to connect the Palmers dysfunction with the legal matters at hand. As it turns out the truth about the case is rather poignant. The movie could have done more with it. But the courtroom scenes are too much at either extreme. One minute Dobkin is doing To Kill a Mockingbird the next its My Cousin Vinny.2 It doesnt feel good to remember that 25 years ago the moral and dramatic stakes were higher. Jessica Lange starred in Costa-Gavrass Music Box as an attorney defending her father (Armin Mueller-Stahl) against charges that he was a Nazi who had worked in the death camps. That movie wasnt perfect but it had warmth and was serious with small spasms of human comedy. Lange and Mueller-Stahl acted from a place of deep emotional connection. And crucially the trial was structured with suspense. You cared about the case and what the verdict would do to that family. Who knows what The Judge is about or whats important to it? More people are going to see it than will ever see Music Box. But if the movie is a hit itll be one thats getting away with murder.  Gary Webb the journalist Jeremy Renner plays in Kill the Messenger also believes hes smarter than everyone. But hes found himself in the midst of a scandalous story It seems that the Central Intelligence Agency did little to stop the U.S. drug epidemic of the 1980s because it was in bed with the Nicaraguan contras some of whom used the smuggling proceeds to arm themselves in their insurgency against the Sandinista government. Webb worked for the San Jose Mercury News and took his own life 10 years ago after almost a decade of defending his work to both an aggressively skeptical national press and a chagrined CIA. In 1995 and 1996 he wrote and reported on a devastating three-part series that blew the lid off those secret alliances catching fire on the Internet at a time when the web carried a fraction of the content it does today. The stories were sensationally packaged and probably overreached. Their implication that the CIA put crack in South Central Los Angeles is a myth that still persists today. At its best the movie dramatizes the ways in which control of the story gets away from Webb. It drops in on the newsrooms of the bigger more powerful New York Times Los Angeles Times and Washington Post which defile Webb and debunk the stories rather than building on them. This stretch of Michael Cuestas movie is a lean paranoia thriller with volleying telephone calls and the government closing in and tense meetings within different organizations including at the Mercury News about how to proceed with Webbs work. But it takes an hour to get there and the tension doesnt last long enough once it does. The screenplay is by Peter Landesman and is based on a pair of nonfiction books Webbs own Dark Alliance The CIA the Contras and the Crack Cocaine Explosion and Nick Schous Kill the Messenger How the CIAs Crack-Cocaine Controversy Destroyed Journalist Gary Webb. Its probably a miracle that Landesman located a two-hour movie in all that material. Theres one nicely done scene in the early going with Webb convicted drug dealer ""Freeway"" Rick Ross (Michael Kenneth Williams) and Rosss attorney (Tim Blake Nelson) in which Ross tells Webb that a cartel guy was also a CIA operative and Webb kind of cant believe it. The comedy in their incredulity points to a different possibly satirical film. But thats just about the only humor this otherwise solemn movie can afford. Webbs pieces about harsh drug forfeiture lead to a busty flirtatious Latina (Paz Vega) coming on to him in a diner to give him documents that point to a bigger story. For an hour it looks as if Kill the Messenger might be one of those vast topical conspiracy dramas like Traffic or Syriana thats more interested in how the conspiracy affects white people than how it affects everyone else. (There are parts here for Richard Schiff Oliver Platt Mary Elizabeth Winstead Michael Sheen Robert Patrick Andy Garcia and Ray Liotta.) It takes too long to make clear that Kill the Messenger is ultimately concerned with Webbs heroism and downfall. Along the way cliches and obviousness litter the movie. When Webb sits down to start writing he puts on the Clash while a montage plays of guns and soldiers faces and black men being locked up. Theres a shot of a camera clicking away at Webb while hes on the go. Meetings with government officials turn ominous in a way that requires Renner to lower his head and make a face that asks ""How did I wind up in The Pelican Brief?"" Just as I finished saying They forgot the scary parking-lot sequence the scary parking-lot sequence came. Renner is consistently strong. Hes a character actor who like Dustin Hoffman hides in plain sight. Unlike Hoffman he might never get the major acclaim he deserves. He doesnt feel compelled to pull the stops out. He was just as alive as everybody else in American Hustle but winning a scene didnt appear to be his goal. Theres shaggy righteousness to Renner as Webb moves from bafflement to fear to anger to something morose. When the brightness goes out of the performance the shading he uses is impeccable. One sequence at a journalism banquet is lit and decorated in a way that feels like the lining of a coffin. The movie wants very much to be a moral and ethical tragedy. And Renner by that point understands Webb to be a martyr participating in his own funeral. It makes sense that Kill the Messenger works when its driven by the action of internal debate and journalistic backstabbing. Cuesta has spent a long time crafting intrigue on Showtimes terrorism drama Homeland. He gives assurance to the scenes of people plotting their next moves. But the movie either needed to be told entirely from inside Webbs point of view or he should be part of larger more integrated work. Kill the Messenger has neither the artistry nor the athleticism to do both.  Ive written before that Im not a fan of movies about parental suffering. Theyre records playing at too slow an RPM and can bring out the worst in an actor. The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby is a parental dirge too but its a patient eloquent one. It opens with a woman Eleanor (Jessica Chastain) jumping off the Manhattan Bridge. She survives but rather than back up to explain how shes come to this first-time writer and director Ned Benson moves forward to show you how she continues to live with herself. Thats the first side Her. Benson flips the album and in the second half -- Him -- Eleanors husband Conor (James McAvoy) tries to live without her. Bensons staffed both halves with strong actors. William Hurt and Isabelle Huppert make perfect psychological and genetic sense as her parents; Jess Weixler is her younger sister. Eleanor starts taking classes and a steely Viola Davis plays the professor. Ciaran Hinds is Conors frigid dad. Bill Hader and Nina Arianda work at the failing restaurant he owns. The Weinstein Company acquired the film and released a conflated edition last month -- Them -- that was an hour shorter. It hung together. Nothing seemed to be missing except everything that felt special in the two-sided version -- its quiet and patience and searching emotionalism; the finesse and assurance of the acting; the sense that two lives were happening to you. Them was like reaching into a dryer and pulling out a shrunken delicate. It should never have gone in the wash in the first place. Im sensitive to the charge that Bensons made a slow callow bourgeois movie and that its probably unfair to Conors side of things thats it ultimately not about enough. But I watched this movie -- the longer two-sided version which is being released this weekend -- in a state of captivation. I was seeing a new filmmaker one with a smart eye and a talent for establishing and maintaining psychological intricacy. American movies are running perilously low on fresh youngish talent. Who knows what Benson will do next. I just left his first movie desperate to experience the second one.  Its quite a pronouncement to call your vampire movie Dracula Untold. After scores of movies books and television shows and millions of Halloween costumes what else is there to tell? Lots apparently. Dracs agent obliged and now hes in what is basically 300 Games of Thrones. The story dares to prequelize Bram Stokers 1897 novel giving us Luke Evans as Transylvanias Vlad III Tepes a.k.a. Vlad the Impaler a.k.a. Count Dracula and his transformation from warrior-prince to the immortal neck-biter also known as the Son of the Devil. No one needed this story. Yet Mehmed the Conqueror (Dominic Cooper) attempts to conscript 1000 Transylvanian boys to fight in his army -- and presumably to keep him in bronzer eyeliner and designer haircuts too. The conscripts include Vlads young son (Art Parkinson) so this work of tedious fan fiction forces a Faustian bargain The old cave-dwelling Roman emperor Caligula (Charles Dance) gives Vlad two days of superpowerful vampirism to gut the Turks and save the boys. If at the end of 48 hours Vlad has avoided the taste of blood he gets his mortality back and can resume making stressless love to the missus (Sarah Gadon). If not hes avoiding the sun forever. As a vampire Vlad morphs into hundreds of CGI bats that mow down thousands of invading CGI Turks. He waves his arms and poses to conduct his own bat army (cue the eye rolls from Wayne Manor). The big showdown between Vlad and Mehmed relies on silver serving as vampire Kryptonite (cue the eye rolls from every werewolf in America). Most of the time I found myself feeling like I was waiting for a turn with the gaming controls. Basically its just depressing to hear Dracula or Caligula or whoever say things like ""The worlds fate hangs in the balance"" as if what Stoker or ancient history had always wanted was to write a Dungeon Siege tale. In the end some ideas about faith blasphemy and mob rule get half-explored. Theres even a finale that sets up a sequel that looks so much better than the dull starchy one weve just watched that you dont know why they didnt just make that. Why give us all this muffin when all anybody wants is the top? OK OK Its Thyme by the River.And the twinkling music doesnt stop either; Thomas Newmans score keeps humping your leg.

"Dracula Untold | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; dracula-untold ) Dracula Untold (United States 2014) October 09 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Dracula Untold purports to relate the origin of how the worlds most famous vampire became the creature we all know and fear. Unfortunately Gary Shores film suffers from narrative issues and problems of execution. Some of these are likely beyond his control but they result in a generic vampire tale in the Underworld vein that comes closer to the infamous Van Helsing than a memorable re-interpretation of a legendary monster. Instead of being respectful of Bram Stokers creation it attempts to remake him as a tragic figure with superhero powers. One of the first rules of horror cinema is that it isnt possible to make a good PG-13 vampire movie. Vampires are all about sex and death and gore. Theyre hideous frightening creatures. Done right theyre scary. None of this can be effectively represented given the restrictions of the MPAAs PG-13 classification but that doesnt stop Shore (making his feature debut) from trying. And failing. In order to keep the violence and bloodshed at acceptable levels he resorts to a lot of fast cutting with objects obscuring the cameras view. A scene in which 1000 men are slaughtered is an incoherent mess; its impossible not to be distracted by the manner in it is shot. Then theres the sex which is presented in a typically chaste PG-13 manner. Dracula Untold could have used a little eroticism not only to emphasize the bond between the main characters but to amplify the tragedy of what Dracula loses along with his humanity. Theres nothing wrong with the premise which blends a cherry-picked selection of facts from the life of the ""historical"" Dracula with those of the mythological beast Stoker birthed. Dracula (Luke Evans) born Vlad Tepes spends his childhood and young life serving in the Turkish army. Following a series of bloody brutal campaigns hes allowed to return to his home country of Transylvania where he reigns as a prince and vassal to Mehmed (Dominic Cooper) the sultan of Turkey. After years of peace the sultan decides that in additional to the usual monetary tribute he collects from Transylvania he wants 1000 boys for his army including Vlads son Ingeras (Art Parkinson). Deeming this to be too steep a price to pay Vlad goes to war. Recognizing that he cannot defeat the mighty Turkish army with a small largely untrained force he seeks supernatural aid in the haunted caves of a nearby mountain. There he meets the Master Vampire (Charles Dance) who offers him a bargain power for damnation. He accepts and uses his new abilities to save his people but when they learn what he has become on their behalf they turn on him. For the better part of an hour Dracula Untold does a reasonable job establishing the setting and characters. This isnt an atmospheric motion picture but there are some unsettling moments in the caverns where the Master Vampire is entombed. Were presented with the beginnings of a loving relationship between Vlad and his beautiful wife Mirena (Sarah Gadon). Sadly the final half-hour is as unsatisfying as one can imagine; the aforementioned PG-13 limitations combine with an excess of computer-generated special effects to ruin the climax. The films epilogue takes the curious step of repudiating the entirety of Stokers classic novel. Although the majority of Dracula Untold provides the backstory leading up to Dracula the movies final scene indicates that the events of the book never transpire in this alternate universe. Perhaps theres a fundamental failing the filmmakers dont recognize could it be that Dracula as an entity is passA(c)? Over the years there have been so many different interpretations of his legend that its no longer possible for a story about the character to be interesting surprising or compelling. (The last noteworthy Dracula adaptation was Werner Herzogs 1979 Nosferatu.) Although Tod Brownings 1931 version isnt a great movie Bela Lugosis iconic performance has loomed over the character for nearly 85 years. Luke Evans wisely doesnt attempt imitation but his interpretation devolves into that of an undistinguished vampire in a production that is little different from any other recent (non- Twilight) movie about the bloodsucking undead. The use of the name ""Dracula"" is a marketing tool. This isnt so much an expansion of the legend as it is a complete rewriting of it. Theres nothing here to convince that the story of Dracula Untold needs to be told.

Youre not going to build sympathy for a guy called Vlad the Impaler who lives in Castle Dracula in Transylvania and who only gave up the impaling gig because hed finally sickened of the sight of the thousands of corpses hed speared on as many tall sharp sticks.Article Continued BelowNever mind that its the 15th Century not exactly the era of enlightenment and Vlad has an excuse for his abuse. Invading Ottoman Turks had kidnapped the Transylvanian prince as a teen and press-ganged him into participating in genocide along with 999 other enslaved child soldiers. Young Vlad got rather good at his ghastly gig. You can see just how good in a rare moment of this claustrophobic and muddy-looking pic when rookie director Gary Shore and lenser John Schwartzman (The Amazing Spider-Man) pull the camera back to survey the grisly body count. Vlads obviously not into pink flamingos or garden gnomes for his front lawn.Faster than you can say ""I vant to drink your blood"" its some 20 years later. Prince Vlad has grown to adulthood played in dour macho mode by The Hobbits Luke Evans with no serious scars except the ones on his newly activated conscience.Vlad has turned peacenik while also snagging a lovely wife (Sarah Gadon). Together theyve produced a tousle-haired son (Art Parkinson) who you just know will become a bargaining chip for maniacal and murderous Turkish Sultan Mehmed II (Dominic Cooper). The sultan greedily also demands another 1000 Transylvanian tots for soldier training pronto lest he unleash hell on Vlads weirdly tame people.The Transylvanians dont stand a chance -- even Vlad talks about negotiating with Mehmed rather than impaling him. But then the Trannies find a cave filled with bats lined with crushed human skulls and hosting a lurking entity who seems like a cross between Star Wars Phantom Menace and Dickens Jacob Marley.The cave dweller (Charles Dance) has been hiding there for eternity awaiting the day when a sucker er courageous man would go for his bizarre money-back deal drink a bowl of his blood and turn into a monstrously powerful vampire for three days long enough to lay waste to the Turks. As long as you dont drink any more blood for three days youll turn back into good ol Vlad none the worse for wear.Seems like reasonable offer even if youve read Faust or seen Francis Ford Coppolas Dracula and Vlad doesnt have much of a choice. Either he turns temporary vampire or he his family and his fellow Transylvanians will be turned into Turkish lawn ornaments.All this should be scary and tragic but it isnt. The CGI battle scenes are fake as hell the bat hordes Vlad summons look like a food fight in a Milk Duds factory and the incredible romance that supposedly motivates him seems as heartfelt as plastic roses on a coffin.We already know Vlad is going to become Count Dracula -- screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless based him both on historical fact and Bram Stokers novel creation -- so why cant we get more fang and less fuss?This movie should really have been titled Dracula Unsold because nobodys going to buy this bloody bore.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

VPC Brian Truitt USA TODAY 321 p.m. EDT October 9 2014Vlad (Luke Evans) makes a fateful deal to fight for his family and people in ""Dracula Untold.""(Photo Universal Pictures)Twilights vampires did enough damage to the undead. But at times Dracula Untold flirts with dullness so much that it might as well just stick a stake in the heart of Bram Stokers legacy.But at least Luke Evans doesnt sparkle like the vampires in Twilight.His Dracula turns the iconic villain into a Transylvanian action hero in the new horror-fantasy film ( out of four; rated PG-13; opens in select theaters Thursday and nationwide Friday). But before he unleashes his power Dracula Untold drags like a heavy coffin.USA TODAYSt. Vincent stuck in lovable grouch modeInstead of being the Bela Lugosi romantic type Evans character is based on the real legend of Vlad the Impaler though real-life Vlad probably didnt have a posse of brooding bros or a growly Batman voice (though he is literally a bat-man -- more on that later).Its 1414 and Prince Vlad a former Turkish slave is enjoying a period of peace with his people until a bunch of Turkish scouts go missing near Broken Tooth Mountain. (It is fittingly named.) The sultan Mehmed (Dominic Cooper) an old pal of Vlads comes sniffing around and wants 1000 Transylvanian boys to fill out his Turk army or else.Vlad not wanting to give his son up to slavery makes a deal with the Master Vampire (Charles Dance of Game of Thrones) to gain extraordinary abilities in order to keep his wife Mirena (Sarah Gadon) and people safe. One caveat While his powers last for three days before he turns back into a mortal theres no coming back from going full vamp if he gives in to his extreme thirst for blood.Director Gary Shore makes his feature debut and whips up some effects-laden battles where Vlad not only can turn himself into a bunch of bats but also can control seemingly millions of the little guys to crash down on invading armies and shake the earth.Sharknado? Pffft. One hasnt lived until witnessing the glory of a Batnado.Vlad (Luke Evans) warns his son Ingeras (Art Parkinson) to run in a scene from the motion picture ""Dracula Untold"" the origin story of the man who became Dracula. Gary Shore directs and Michael De Luca produces the epic action-adventure. (Photo Universal Pictures)Those Game of Thrones-style epic sequences balance out the weak dialogue which switches between cliche fantasy lines and outtakes from a Die Hard script After Vlad wipes out a bunch of Turks he walks off the battlefield with a swagger and a one-liner ""Negotiations failed."" Mileage may vary on how much old-school Dracula fans want their favorite guy to be John McClane with fangs.Evans does what he can and exudes enough charisma to make his Vlad pop at times especially in one sequence that couldnt be more obvious in cementing Dracula Untold as the start of a Marvel Studios-style shared universe of movies.Does that make Evans the Monster Avengers answer to Tony Stark? Who knows but at least he can rock a serious Batnado. 71 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1vUpteo",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/10/09/dracula-untold-review/16452913/,200,draculauntold6,draculauntold,usatoday

Photo Universal Studios MOVIE REVIEW Dracula Untold Running time 93 minutes. Rated PG-13 (violence slaughter). At the Empire the Lincoln Square the 34th Street others. The origins story ""Dracula Untold"" is Dracula unbold -- unoriginal unimaginative and utterly non-unprecedented. This Vlad the Impaler has all the edge of Vlasic the pickle. A drab Welshman named Luke Evans -- his go-to expression is a disbelieving wince -- plays Vlad as a wise Transylvanian prince a fond daddy and sweetheart to his wife (Sarah Gadon). The last time he fought a war he left a field full of enemies with pikes running through them like Swedish meatballs. Nonetheless the Sultan of Turkey (Dominic Cooper) likes his chances and cheekily demands Prince Vlad turn over a thousand boy-children including his own son for induction in to the Turkish army. Vlad cant quite oblige so on a hunch he drops by the creepy cave where he and his men were nearly killed by the local spawn of hell (Charles Dance) who lurks there. The monster helpfully mentions that a gulp of his blood will give Vlad the super-strength he needs to crush the Turks. Mirena (Sarah Gadon) attempts to reason with husband Vlad (Luke Evans).Photo Universal Studios If Vlad can resist the urge to drink human blood for three days hell then return to normal. If not Vlad had better cancel all garlic and silver deliveries and forget about suntanning. Since we kinda have an idea how this is going to end up there isnt a whole lot of suspense. Instead we get bits and pieces of better movies. The figures impaled against a blood-red sky are borrowed from Francis Ford Coppolas vastly superior 1992 ""Dracula""; the ranks of CGI soldiers mowing each other meaninglessly down could be outtakes from ""The Lord of the Rings"" or ""300""; and the way apparently solid objects dissolve into fields of bats is straight from ""Batman Begins"" in which the image was a grace note. Here though rookie director Gary Shore uses and reuses it endlessly like the kid guitar player who cant lay off the feedback. Dominic Cooper stars as Mehmed in the film.Photo Universal Studios Shore is even fuzzy on the basics Is silver a mortal enemy to vampires or is it more of an irritant like jock itch? If the former why can Vlad fight effectively in a room full of it? If the latter who cares? Were told that Vlad will lose his powers when the sun comes up on the third day except it does and he doesnt. Nor is it clear what it takes to kill a vampire. The blinding light of day might or might not do it. Shore isnt too sure. Who cares Heres another shot of clouds of bats A silly coda (shades of 2011s ""Captain America"") doesnt make much sense either. Bat man begins here and my guess is that its also where this retelling of the story ends.

Now we can add ""Dracula Untold"" to the batch of failures.What is ""Dracula Untold""? Imagine the legendary tale in a ""Game of Thrones""-like setting. Then take out all the nudity and gore and there you have it. In this lightweight medieval fantasy/origin story the sweet existence of Lord Vlad Tepes (Luke Evans) his wife Mirana (Sarah Gadon) and teen son Ingeras (Art Parkinson) is interrupted when Sultan Mehmed (Dominic Cooper) demands 1000 boys including Ingeras join his army.Vlad makes a pact with a creaky old master vampire (Charles Dance) in an effort to save his son. The trade-off is that Vlad becomes a vampire.He uses his new powers -- super strength ability to dissolve into a mass of bats etc. -- to fight Mehmeds army and keep his family together.Directed by Gary Shore the dull ""Dracula Untold"" feels longer than its 95-minute running time. And whats the point of a Dracula story without blood? A couple of watchable CGI sequences include a beautifully shot death scene that comes too late to save the movie.This toothless attempt is just dead on arrival.What ""Dracula Untold""  One and a half stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 135  Content Intense warfare vampire attacks disturbing images and some sensuality Kevin C.

(Universal Pictures) BY Jordan Hoffman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday October 9 2014 106 PM Title Dracula Untold Film Info The origin story of the famous vampire trades Victorian scares for 15th-century battles. With Luke Evans Sarah Gadon. Director Gary Shore (132). PG-13 Violence. Area theaters. This is how the real bat-man begins. Luke Evans of ""Fast amp; Furious 6"" is sufficiently swashbuckling to play Prince Vlad a 15th-century warrior defending his people against approaching armor-plated enemies. But this is no ordinary field of battle. Sultan Mehmed II (Dominic Cooper) is coming to Transylvania to take ""one thousand boysz"" back to Turkey under the brutal lash of army conscription. Vlad suffered the same fate as a child earning him the war name Vlad the Impaler. He doesnt want that for his son (Art Parkinson or Rickon of ""Game of Thrones"") so he promises his wife (Sarah Gadon) hell protect him -- even if it means starting a war. Vlad needs a tactical edge against the Turks. He finds it in a cave where a Crypt-Keeper-looking Charles Dance (Tywin Lannister also of ""Game of Thrones"" in case youre sensing a trend) offers great powers that come from drinking some hexed blood. ""Dracula Untold"" is hazy in laying out the rules but basically if Vlad resists the temptation to take a second sip ... hell have vampire power for three days and then return to normal. During the final battle Vlad must condemn his soul to darkness to get the job done. The twist offers some sympathy for the Devil thats interesting to dwell on but feels forced in this story. Vlad (Luke Evans) seeks compassion from wife Mirena (Sarah Gadon) in ""Dracula Untold."" (Universal Pictures) The CGI -- mostly Evans transforming into fightin bats -- look muddy and cheap but the weapons Turkish helmets and Romanian interiors are all gorgeous. If only the rest of this ""Lord of the Rings"" wanna-be were at the same level. On a mobile device? Click here to watch video.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Michael OSullivan October 9 2014 For a tantalizing half hour or so it actually seemed like the underlying idea of ""Dracula Untold"" -- an origin story drawing its DNA from superhero flicks not monster movies -- might go somewhere. Unfortunately in its search for fresh blood to rejuvenate the desiccated corpse of Bram Stokers hero long since drained of narrative power it goes places it shouldnt. The films problems arent limited to liberal cadging from comic books. In fact thats precisely whats best about the film which occasionally boasts gorgeous visuals. But the movie doesnt know when to stop stealing. Its Prince Vlad -- played by Luke Evans as an honorable 15th-century Balkan crimefighter who acquires superhuman abilities and a thirst for blood after an encounter with a ghoul in a cave -- evokes at various times Spider-Man Superman the Hulk and other freaks as he adjusts to his gifts. ""Sometimes what the world needs is no longer a hero"" says Vlad as he prepares to open a can of whup-ass on the evil Turks who have invaded his homeland. ""Sometimes what it needs is a monster."" Thats not a bad line courtesy of writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless. But the film doesnt restrict its borrowing to a single genre. It also owes a heavy stylistic debt both visually and thematically to ""300"" ""Twilight"" and ""Game of Thrones."" (Two of its actors Charles Dance and Art Parkinson have recurring roles on that television show.) But there are other even more incongruous touches especially among the movies villains. One Turkish soldier with beautiful blond braids looks like a cross between Charlie Hunnam from ""Sons of Anarchy"" and the bassist from a Swedish metal band. And the marauders leader played by Dominic Cooper with an indeterminate globetrotting accent sports what my screening companion Jenny called a ""boy-band"" fade. Then theres the word ""okay"" which gets uttered by various characters not once but three times. In 15th-century Romania. Okaaay. Deeper questions of logic arise from the films handling of established vampire lore. Although the films bloodsuckers prove sensitive to silver daylight and crucifixes it isnt clear exactly what effect the metal has on Vlad other than as a kind of low-grade kryptonite. Sure it appears to weaken him but not terribly. And where does his ability come from to control both weather and bats the latter of which make up the films silliest special effect? At one point our hero summons a 50000-ton batcloud from the sky pummeling a phalanx of Turks like a giant flying fist made of flapping wings. That said the film isnt awful. There are moments of handsome cinematography and occasional effects that both frighten and impress. The takeaway We might have to get used to the newfangled bloodsucker-with-a-heart-of-gold who takes on the name Dracula only near the end of the film which concludes with a groaningly obvious sequel set-up. Universal Pictures which made the movie recently announced plans to reboot its entire back catalogue of classic monster movies. Get ready for ""Creature From the Black Lagoon Untold.""  1/2 PG-13. At area theaters. Contains violence scary sequences and brief sensuality. 92 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Gary Shore directs and Michael De Luca produces the epic action-adventure. Photo Jasin Boland Dracula Untold review The sadness of Vlads dilemma 1 / 1 Back to Gallery To its credit ""Dracula Untold"" finds something new to do with the Dracula story. It mixes the vampire element with some of the true history of Vlad the Impaler who in this movie is a really nice guy saddled with an unfortunate nickname. For that reason when he meets a woman here he just says ""Im Vlad"" and leaves off the other part because the name is a distraction in forging relationships. Vlad the Impaler (Luke Evans) here as in history was a 15th century Transylvanian prince who found himself in conflict with the Turks the dominant power in the region. The film is particularly and most genuinely effective in the early scenes in which Vlad faces a horrible choice He either can lead his people to annihilation by fighting an uphill battle against the Turks or he can give into the cruel Sultan (Dominic Cooper) and turn over 1000 Transylvanian boys including his son to be made into Turkish soldiers. ""Dracula Untold"" is no campy vampire movie and the early part of the film is well-made enough that the sadness of Vlads dilemma is truly felt. Here is this proud man who either has to preside over the destruction of his kingdom or tell his nice pretty wife (Sarah Gadon) to surrender their only child to some power-mad potentate. No wonder Vlad looks for an alternative besides those two awful choices. No wonder he looks into acquiring ... certain skills ... that will make him a nightmare to people like the Sultan. I suppose if youre already named Vlad the Impaler getting called Dracula would be considered a step up. In any case ""Dracula Untold"" also might be called ""Dracula Begins"" in that it tells how he got his start. He visits a cave where he makes a deal with the Master Vampire (Charles Dance) with the intention of going back to being a normal human being after 72 hours of unlimited vampire power. The only thing that could go wrong is if he drinks blood between now and then. If he does thats it. He will be fully and completely lost. So here we have a vampire movie that brings together elements from other more popular movies. As in the ""Twilight"" series we have a fellow who cant get sexually aroused at least not without wanting to rip open someones neck. As in the ""Lord of the Rings"" series we have a man dabbling in absolute power while trying to avoid ultimate corruption. And as in ""The Lost Weekend"" (1945) starring Ray Milland we have an addict trying to white-knuckle it through a very long three days. This is clever -- not inspired but OK. Inevitably of course a vampire movie must be a vampire movie and so this one ultimately succumbs to genre with enough red blood on white fangs to make its quota. Still ""Dracula Untold"" is better than you might expect. Mick LaSalle is The Chronicles movie critic. E-mail mlasallesfchronicle.com Twitter micklasalle Dracula Untold Vampire movie.

When we first meet him this time around Vlad the Impaler (Luke Evans) is filled with regret. Hes spent his youth as a warrior-slave for the Ottoman Turks committing horrific misdeeds in their service. Now returned to his rightful Transylvanian throne with a family of his own he wants to keep his semi-autonomy from Sultan Mehmed II (a sneering snarling Dominic Cooper) his former brother-in-arms. But the Sultan isnt having it. He wants a thousand young boys to enslave anew for his Janissary army along with Vlads young son Ingeras (Art Parkinson). ""Whats one son?"" the Sultan quips. ""If you are virile you will make plenty more."" This aggression will not stand man. Desperate Vlad turns to the one force that can help him a mysterious vampire who lives in a remote mountain cave and whose untold powers our hero thinks he can harness for his own by joining the undead. He wants essentially to trade in one kind of slavery for another. Theres a catch however Vlad can have the powers of a vampire for three days and if he can resist drinking another persons blood for those three days hell be freed of his curse and return to being a mortal. If not then hell be ""a scourge on this earth destined to destroy everything you love."" Thats a pretty clear choice and a pretty clear timeline He has three days to defeat the Turks or he becomes a monster. Will he succeed? Is there no franchise if this movie manages to have a happy ending? The blurring of the usual Dracula myth provides just enough uncertainty that we start to wonder where the film is actually headed. Dracula Untold is a dumb lowest-common-denominator kind of movie but its a surprisingly entertaining one. Its brisk which counts for a lot in this overbaked genre. The action is directed with verve and imagination -- and its all gorgeously bleak with black clouds of bats whipping around remote craggy castles beneath portentous Carpathian skies. Theres little nuance but lots of intensity Evans is called on to show tenderness for about five whole seconds; the rest of the time hes glowering roaring or screaming. But hes got a face built for this sort of thing In films like Fast and Furious 6 and The Hobbit The Desolation of Smaug hes commanded our attention with those angry eyes and that constantly clenched jaw. (In fact have I ever seen this man smile in a movie?) He seems genuinely tough and haunted We buy the idea that this is someone who has already spent half a lifetime impaling humans on stakes. That makes his dilemma as well as his potential for violence rather captivating. A A That said the film also avoids taking itself too seriously which is so often the kiss of death for these movies. A lesser more opportunistic filmmaker might have tried to sell the Clash of Civilizations angle in this story as Zack Snyder did in 300. But here director Gary Shore (making his first film after a career in commercials) and screenwriters Burk Sharpless and Matt Sazama avoid overtly Orientalizing the Muslim Turks There isnt a turban or a prayer rug in sight among the bad guys. (To be fair this probably has less to do with aesthetic bravery and more to do with avoiding offense and some will find it a bit of a chicken move but hey as a Turk I appreciated it. And its not like they made us the good guys or anything; were still pretty awful people in this movie.) I dont want to oversell this film. But in an era in which weve seen a lot of failed attempts to reinvent classic fantasy tales as CGI-action spectacles it feels remarkably assured. In part its working with good material The Dracula story has always been rooted in a mysterious evocative milieu and the character has always had a kind of brooding uncertainty. He is as much a romantic as he is a monster and you can mold him to fit whatever sensibility you want. Dracula Untold may turn him into a hero but we see the potential for real cruelty lurking right beneath the surface.

These primo lines of Christopher Nolan-speak come courtesy of the cadaverous cave-dwelling bloodsucker who grants the title character his malevolent powers. Heres the thing though The Dracula who appears in this expensive action-packed reboot is more hero than monster. Raised by his enemies the Turks to be a great warrior the count (Luke Evans) only joins the ranks of the undead as a desperate measure to save Transylvania from the conquerors at its gates. Once hes slurped down the red stuff Drac gains all kinds of nifty skills He can cover long distances as a flock of bats or conduct the little winged companions like a biblical swarm. These gifts are not without their drawbacks however--namely an insatiable hankering for vein juice as well as the distrust of the people hes sworn to protect. Heavy is the cape etc.More sad dad and noble martyr than creature of the night Evans dashing Prince Of Darkness inspires less fear than just about any incarnation of the famous character save perhaps the one played by Leslie Nielsen. Thats mostly because Dracula Untold isnt in the scaring business; rebooting a horror icon into a 15th-century Dark Knight the film sees in its Bram Stoker source material only the promise of an untapped franchise. (Or many franchises considering Universals plan to give its roster of monsters the extended-universe Avengers treatment.) Those who go in expecting some seasonal Fangoria fare will instead be greeted by yet another comic-book origin story this one complete with requisite CGI armies and little Year One winks (like the brief appearance of a Renfield type hissing ""master"" at the fledgling fiend).Essentially an extended remake of the prologue to Francis Ford Coppolas boldly stylized 1992 adaptation Dracula Untold mixes elements of historical fiction into its wannabe blockbuster makeup. The legendary clash between Vlad The Impaler--Stokers real-life inspiration for Dracula--and the Ottoman Empire is the fact-based backdrop with the films screenwriters entertaining the notion that a supernatural influence accounted for Vlads 300-like vanquishing of the Turks. Unable to protect his homeland from Mehmed (Dominic Cooper) who demands an army of Transylvanian child soldiers Dracula makes a pact with the forces of darkness; hes got three days to defeat his enemies before vampirism becomes a permanent (read eternal) way of life. And so while his wife (Sarah Gadon totally wasted) frets about his condition the count goes to town on teeming masses of soldiers fighting the urge to sink his fangs into some jugulars and seal his franchise-mandated fate.The battles are bloodless and frenetically shot preserving the coveted PG-13 rating though a flurry of unintelligible carnage. At least the castles and landscapes look cool in a very Game Of Thrones kind of way; Dracula Untold suckles at the veins of that HBO series borrowing a composer Ramin Djawadi and a few cast members. (Done up like Nosferatu Charles Dance brings a Lannisterian disdain to his role as the Ras Al Ghul to Evans Batman.) As a character study though the movie is utter hogwash. Determined to make a tragic antihero out of their eponymous monster the filmmakers sell Vlad The Impalers infamous cruelty as some sort of honorable deterrent applying the Truman atomic-bomb rationale to a man who slaughtered men women and children and stuffed their bodies onto pikes. Of course to take Vlads barbaric villainy at face value would be to risk turning this material into yes an actual horror movie. Dracula Untold would rather fit the count into the superhero-movie mold supplying him with Nolanesque wisdom like ""Even after the darkest night the sun will rise again."" But this is neither the Dracula we need nor the one we deserve.

Well who asked them? True having sucked as much life from their classic monsters as possible the studio would obviously like to revive the lot spinning out the requisite new trilogies. (""Dracula Untold"" ends of course unconcluded.) But Dracula is not the original Batman. He is his own monster made up of scraps of Romanian history and Bram Stokers very Victorian fears of female lust venereal disease and oily foreign seducers. He is the great gentlemanly ghoul -- the fiend in dinner clothes who must ask permission before crossing your threshold -- and as such he stands alone among the mass of stumbling creatures and apart from the requirements of modern movie marketing. But ""Dracula Untold"" drops that idea this time combining the same old shreds of 15th-century history with modern fears of rampaging Muslim hordes. It updates the xenophobia while lessening the magic (and taming the eroticism for a mass-audience PG-13). Luke Evans is Dracula a Transylvanian royal who -- having survived a brutal captivity among the Turks -- now stands as his countrys indeed Europes last bulwark against their aggression. But he know he cannot hold them off forever. No single human can. No single human... but perhaps something else could? And so Dracula makes a dark bargain with an ancient creature and begins his war. This is a new slant on the tale admitted but its not a particularly satisfying one nor is it handled in a very dramatic way. If this Dracula can kill hundreds of enemies by himself -- and he can and does in several dull and protracted battle scenes -- then wheres the suspense? If hes become a monster for noble reasons then wheres the dark conflict? Evans broods on cue and late in the film gets to wear some fetchingly tooled armor. But Sarah Gadon is rather bloodless as his bride and Dominic Cooper in pancake makeup is about as convincing a Turk as poor Jose Ferrer in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" itchy under his false moustache. Director Gary Shore is no help either. His special effects -- particularly the distant mountainous landscapes -- look no more realistic than the matte paintings in old Hammer films (but a lot less charming). Battle scenes are unremarkable unremitting blurs. In a way ""Dracula Untold"" harkens back to other recent reinterpretations of iconic stories warts-and-all movies that stripped the epic out of King Arthur and Robin Hood and portrayed them as ordinary men leading ugly lives in muddy backwaters. Those movies failed though and for a reason The reason those old stories have survived for centuries isnt because theyre realistic. Its because theyre romantic. And thats why ""Dracula"" more than 100 years after Stokers novel remains so alive -- its the strange twisted beauty of it all. Its the whisper of a cape on wet cobblestones red eyes that burn in the dark a sudden kiss that brings a flicker of pain. And an eternal thirst that cant be quenched by offering some sort of new PG-13 fanboy franchise. Ratings note The film contains gory violence sensuality. Dracula Untold (PG-13) Universal (92 min.) Directed by Gary Shore. With Luke Evans Sarah Gadon Dominic Cooper.

Just an all-around solid B-picture about the dangers of embracing the darkness in order to defend the light. Dont go looking for horror gore or vampiric sexytimes; this here is an old-fashioned tragedy that just happens to involve a guy who can turn into a cloud of bats.

More than a century has passed since the publication of Bram Stokers oft-adapted novel and both vampire mythology and folk tales surrounding the Romanian prince Vlad the Impaler (on whom the fanged count is said to be based) are even older. Is Universal merely grinding out another cheapie franchise or is there genuinely something left to be tapped in this shriveled vein that audiences could genuinely find new? The answer is no. Untold seeks to marry the historical record of the real Vlads war against the Ottoman Empire with his fictional transformation into the worlds most famous undead bloodsucker but it works neither as a sweeping historical epic nor as an action-horror hybrid. Fast amp; Furious 6 baddie Luke Evans plays Vlad with teeth-clenched intensity and his square-jawed fearlessness works far better when hes battling his childhood friend turned power-hungry war monger Sultan Mehmed II (Dominic Cooper) than when hes pledging devotion to his blandly whimpering wife (Sarah Gadon) and children. When Mehmet demands that Vlad turn over the bulk of his kingdoms children for involuntary military service Vlad decides the only way to combat his enemy is to strike a bargain with the unholy beast who lives on the spookily-named Broken Tooth Mountain. (Simply mounting a counter-attack with a human army was out of the question?) Theres a trade-off He can heal his wounds and transform into a swarm of bats but hell forever thirst for blood (and wont ever be able to tan). Even if all this werent explicitly addressed in Stokers classic a lifetime of vampire lore makes the machinations feel drably familiar Vlad finds himself pulled between the family that keeps him human and the monster he is destined to become. Though it has some impressive stylistic flourishes including a series of blood-soaked tableaus that help enliven a lengthy run of sluggish opening narration Untold outs itself as merely the latest entry in a vexing series of effects-crusted Old World epics starring blandly buff European gentlemen (see Clash of the Titans or Immortals both of which featured Evans). The action beats are appropriately intense if a little rote though the film grinds to a halt whenever Vlad talks about familial responsibility. Even the semi-affecting finale is undercut by a franchise-teasing coda. Evans does a fine enough job carrying the characters mantle though what little fun he has exploiting his powers of the night he tempers with all those dull speeches about honor. If Evans is going to wear the fangs for a cinematic eternity he better hope future scripts give his Dracula a badly-needed personality transfusion.

Wednesday October 8 2014 at 4 a.m. By Alan Scherstuhl Luke EvansPhoto by Jasin Boland - (c) 2014 - Universal Pictures This Dracula Begins-style sword-and-fangs curio plays like someone said ""What if we took a vampire flick but did a find-and-replace swapping out all that bare-neck sensuality for some video-game ass-kicking?"" Or ""Remember what the Star Wars prequels did for Darth Vader? Lets foist the same kind of tragic love story on Vlad the Impaler"" And so it was and so it was dull the greatest villain in all cinema bitten on the neck and drained of his hottest blood. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Heres a Dracula who feeds for honor slays for duty and ravishes no one but his own wife who has to beseech him to do so. Within a single night he murders a thousand-man army entirely by himself and manages to pig-stick each corpse upon a pike like an olive on a toothpick. His genocide resembles a canapes tray -- and suggests that the vampire power set also includes supernatural abilities for time management. And he of course broods over the violence that is this slab of Bram Stoker-related entertainment products reason for existing the filmmakers trying to pass off goofy solemnity as something like moral inquiry. This Vlad may be haunted by his deeds but whats that count when millions worldwide are expected to get off on them?All this might sound disarmingly mad. The opening scenes generally are A prologue introduces Baby Vlad a Transylvanian prince commandeered into military service with thousands of other kids by the murderous Turks who are the actual villains in a vampire film. Its in his youth that Vlad first wins the right to emboss ""the Impaler"" on his business cards but after years of proving himself the cruelest of killers the prince returns home to rule his ancestral lands from his throne in Castle Dracula. In the meantime the boy has hunked up into the body of Luke Evans the guy whos going to kill the dragon in the last of those overstuffed undervalued bizarrely generous Hobbit movies.Film Details Dracula Untold RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time92 More Info Trailer Once the Turks again demand Transylvanias children the hero from The Hobbit plunges into the blackest of caves to meet the bad guy from Game of Thrones the great Charles Dance here a master vampire pale and skeletal in his bad-Jedi robes equal parts Bergmans Death and EC Comics Crypt-Keeper. This sequence reveals the promise of pricey PG-13 studio fantasies Its a creepy marvel the work of top craftspeople with the budget to achieve wonders. Since theres so few serious movies left for them to work on why not devote all their ingenuity to fitting Dance with Frito-yellow talons he can patter up and down Vlads sword? Dances cave-beast is endowed with the latest version of Predator-vision and were treated to a lacy bio-light show in his POV shots. But even thats not as effective as Dances presence no matter how much goop is pasted on him The dude holds the camera like no one else in the movie even when his job is to lay out this Draculas silly rules. The upshot By taking a swig of undead blood Vlad can gain all the powers of a vampire for three days. If he makes it that long without giving in to the urge to feed Vlad will then go right back to being human.So its a Faust story a cant-buck-fate story a giving-in-to-the-darkness story. But Vlad is never compellingly tempted to want more power and despite his CGI war crimes he never seems at risk of losing his humanity. Its simply the contrivances of romantic-tragedy plotting that force him an hour or so later to go all-in on the bloodsucking. Worse Dracula Untolds resources -- of invention and money both -- seem to have been spent in that opening third. (Savor the moody shots of Vlad his family and his carriage silhouetted on a hilltop beneath a brooding sky. Then wonder at what it means that such beauties now turn up routinely in films in which they do nothing but distract from a general hollowness.)Too much of the last hour is a muddle of unconvincing hard-to-read nighttime action scenes. Theres little tension because this heroic Vlad is drearily overpowered. He summons all the worlds bats and punches a flock of them into a Turkish army; whenever the sun comes up he just wills great black clouds to blot it out so he can keep right on killing. The climax entails a clever mano-a-vampo on a floor of silver coins -- silver saps Draculas power. But the great counts true weakness it turns out is that hes just not made for video-game action. Dracula Untold isnt a stake through his heart -- its a DualShock in his hands which will neither kill him nor dazzle viewers.Directed by Gary Shore. Written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless.

Daily Edition Login to download Dracula Untold Film Review 508 PM PDT 9/30/2014 by Frank Scheck FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS Bloodless TWITTER The origin story of Bram Stokers famous vampire character A kinder gentler and decidedly hunkier vampire is the not-so-strong selling point of Dracula Untold the origin story of Bram Stokers famous horror creation that no one was particularly clamoring for. Universal Pictures is clearly hoping to resurrect a character with whom theyve been in business for some 83 years but this fantasy-feeling effort delivers little in the way of scares relying mainly on the charismatic presence of Welsh actor Luke Evans (Fast and Furious 6) to anchor the lackadaisical proceedings. Genre fans will no doubt chafe at the films PG-13 demureness with blood seemingly in short supply. Set in 15th century Transylvania the story begins with Prince Vlad (Evans) of Wallachia ruling over his kingdom in beneficent fashion having apparently giving up impaling in favor of happy domesticity with his beautiful wife Mirena (Sarah Gadon) and adorable son Ingeras (Art Parkinson familiar with the milieu from his role in Game of Thrones). Unfortunately Vlad finds himself called into action when the evil Ottoman sultan Mehmed (a glowering Dominic Cooper) demands that 1000 of Wallachias young boys including Vlads son be conscripted into his army. Desperate to defeat the Turks Vlad goes to Broken Tooth Mountain -- cue the inevitable attraction at Universal Studios theme park -- where he encounters a grotesque vampire (Charles Dance the latest in a long line of distinguished British thespians looking to offset their high tax bills) who promptly indoctrinates him. Infused with superhuman powers Vlad at least has an escape clause If he can manage to save his people while refraining from his newfound compulsion to drink human blood for three days he will return to human form. Its not easy since during a break in the action when Vlad is just about to enjoy some connubial bliss hes stricken by the sight of blood coursing through his beloveds veins. He quickly excuses himself explaining in gentlemanly fashion ""I need some air. ... Sorry."" Much of the films running time is consumed by a surplus of CGI-enhanced 300-style battle sequences with Vlad employing such new allies as thousands of bats to help roust his enemies. Along the way he finds himself impaired by the usual problems faced by vampires like a terrible reaction to sunlight and an aversion to silver. The latter weakness is exploited by Mehmed in a climactic sword fight in which he uses thousands of silver coins to stack the odds. Making his feature debut director Gary Shore displays little flair for the action sequences with such stylistic devices as using Vlads POV for several scenes adding to the overall cheesiness. Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless muddled screenplay seems so intent on providing a Maleficent-style revisionist spin that its hard to believe that this heroic and sympathetic figure will ever wind up tormenting the nightmares of children for centuries to come. A coda set in the present day with Vlad encountering his seemingly reincarnated wife in meet-cute fashion is beyond silly although it does provide the opportunity for Dances malevolent character to reappear and set up the hoped-for sequel by intoning ""Let the games begin."" But much like the recent widely reviled I Frankenstein this misconceived project mainly signals a need to go back to the drawing board.

Theres nothing new under the moon in ""Dracula Untold"" a decorous but dull origin story that attempts to turn historys most famous vampire into a kind of male Maleficent -- a misunderstood husband/father/ruler who turned to the dark side out of the noblest intentions. What next? ""Freddy Krueger Meets Dr. Freud?"" Lavishly mounted by first-time feature director Gary Shore minus the cheeky good humor that propelled his 2006 creature-feature short ""The Draft"" this Legendary-Universal co-production (which opens today overseas 10 days ahead of its domestic bow) looks to scare up only modest Halloween-season biz amid competition from Warners ""Annabelle"" (out Oct. 3) and Us own ""Ouija"" (out Oct. 24). Like Bram Stoker before them screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless (the forthcoming ""Gods of Egypt"") take their inspiration from the real historical figure of Vlad Dracula (aka Vlad the Impaler) a 15th-century Transylvanian prince taken hostage as a teenager by warring Ottoman Turks and trained in their military ways (events recounted here in a visually striking prologue comprised of three-dimensional static images). We then pick things up a couple of decades later where an adult Vlad (Luke Evans suitably glowering and downcast) has returned to his people who maintain an uneasy peace with the ever-looming Turks. When the new Sultan Vlads childhood frienemy Mehmed II (Dominic Cooper) demands 1000 Transylvanian youths as conscripts for his army -- among them Vlads own son Ingeras (Art Parkinson cementing a very conspicuous ""Game of Thrones"" vibe) -- the war-weary prince sees no option but to defy the Sultans demands. And so the outnumbered out-sworded Transylvanians prepare for battle. But lo all hope is not lost for ye who enter here -- here being a mountain cave stumbled upon by Vlad and two adjutants wherein lurks an ancient ur-vampire (a lip-smacking Charles Dance) who after making mincemeat out of the princes traveling companions offers him a special trial membership (who knew?) in the cult of the undead. Drink his blood says the vampire and for three days Vlad will possess the strength of 10 men along with a voracious craving for human blood. If he succumbs to that temptation then vampire he shall remain for eternity. If he can resist then at dawn on the third day the curse will be lifted. This being an origin story whose outcome is pretty well known ""Dracula Untold"" doesnt really have anywhere to go from there save for a couple of frenetic large-scale battle scenes designed around Vlads newfound ability to shape-shift from human form into a colony of bats -- a special effect that wears out its novelty while Shore is still playing with it like a shiny new Christmas toy. (Most of the time it looks like a flurry of dirt particles in front of the lens.) The only real suspense here isnt so much whether as when Vlad is finally going to sink his pearly whites into the jugular of his devoted wife Mirena (Sarah Gadon so pale trusting and beautiful that one knows it cant possibly end well for her). Well that and how a creature with a marked aversion to wood can continue to spout Sazama and Sharpless dialogue. Whereas Francis Coppolas 1992 ""Dracula"" (a veritable golden oldie in todays short-term cultural memory) was a baroque high-fashion free-for-all ""Dracula Untold"" opts for the stately staid approach and even at a mere 85 minutes (sans credits) its something of a bore -- neither scary nor romantic nor exciting in any of the ways it seems to intend. The Irish-born Shore whos also logged a lot of hours as a commercials director certainly knows how to frame an attractive shot and cinematographer John Schwartzman has accommodated him lushly by shooting in 35mm anamorphic widescreen. But the movie never finds its own style or feels like more than a mashup of outtakes from ""Thrones"" and the entire Peter Jackson catalog (with a nifty but fleeting infrared vision effect borrowed from the urban werewolf classic ""Wolfen""). ""Dracula Untold"" is too high-minded to let go into the kind of energetic B-movie escapism a director like John Carpenter or Paul W.S. Anderson might have brought to the same material while the material itself is too thin to support the heavy-handed Wagnerian approach. The result is finally something neither here nor there -- a vampire movie with nothing at stake. Film Review Dracula UntoldReviewed at Universal screening room New York Sept. 30 2014.

But as a fan I have to say that it was not necessary to use Muslim symbols and names such as Mohammad Alla or Tork. The movie it self is a legend so the names could be imagenary too. As whole i appriciate the hard work bihind it.

Really enjoyed it and the actors were terrific and believable Sometimes a revamped old school story is needed for new generations. I think this Dracula version is a GREAT version for the new generation of Vampire fans. I was impressed with the historical facts they incorporated into the film that many of the previous older movies did not. Great movie ALL around. Reply sepakushite says October 2 2014 at 643 pm saw this the other night and it was absolutely abysmal - terrible writing and direction - Gary Shore has alot to learn and may have been saved here by his cinematographer as its at least pretty - but my god its so average like The Wolfman - such great monsters yet how can you fck this up? Reply Leischer Maela says October 2 2014 at 213 pm Reading first few paragraphs and thinking... Theon Grayjoy Reply Marius says October 2 2014 at 1144 am Vlad the Impaler was born in Transylvania (a medieval Romanian province ruled by the Hungarian Kingdom) but he like his father before him ruled in Wallachia (Tara Romaneasca) an another medieval Romanian province. Come on this is basic history Reply Jared K. says October 1 2014 at 529 pm This guy (Scott Foundas) sounds like he has a huge ego and his review just sounds more annoying than informative. I didnt think it was going to be terrifying or have any humor but a pretty cool and sleek vision of Draculas origin. And guess what? Thats exactly what it looks like with some big battle scenes and Luke Evans giving a damn good performance as usual who is also always overlooked no matter what movie hes in. Reply The Kingslayer says October 1 2014 at 128 pm I reckon if you leave your brain at the door you could probably enjoy this. Reply Tony Casci says October 1 2014 at 1259 pm Such a trashy review. Please get a new writer. Reply Matt McGowan (matt_mcgowan) says October 1 2014 at 825 am Looks like you missed Zach McGowan (Shameless Black Sails) who plays the part of Shkelgim. Not sure about you guys but Im going to watch this film just because he is in it Reply Chelsea says October 1 2014 at 722 am I wonder what Grace Randolph and Jeremy Jahns says about this movie. Reply century says September 30 2014 at 719 pm It may or may not be a good film; I will wait to decide until after I see it. However I understand that it is supposed to be more close to the story of Vlad the Impaler. Reply valhallaarwen says September 30 2014 at 629 pm I hated Coppolas Dracula I still want my money back because that is not Bram Stokers Dracula. Where the fuck is the love story in that book? Not between Dracula and Mina for sure. Reply mad says October 2 2014 at 928 am Leave Dracula alone its a monster if you want romance and shit now you have Twilight ;) Reply valhallaarwen says October 2 2014 at 350 pm Mad I didnt want a love story read my comment. I asked where was the love story in the book Dracula. There was none it was bullshit that Coppola made up. If you read my comment I was stating that I hate directors who use an authors name on a movie and then butchers it. Obviously he didnt read Bram Stokers Dracula because he would know there is no love story. I am not some stupid ass Twilight lover I wanted Dracula to be the monster we all know and love. cigar towelette? says September 30 2014 at 524 pm ""Vampire movie with nothing at stake"" Ha Ha You slay me Scott Foundas Reply Joe DeMuro says January 30 2015 at 556 pm See Tales of Dracula coming 2015. Dracula is the Monster you are looking for. Reply cadavra says September 30 2014 at 522 pm In my case itll be DRACULA UNSEEN. -D Reply fishnets (fish_nets) says October 1 2014 at 535 am haha this Variety review is way more fun that the movie ever hopes to be. ""Male Maleficent"" ""Whats next? Freddie Krueger meets Dr Freud?"" are all awesome pans. This drek-ula looked like I Frankenstein sequel so no susprise reviews are in the same range.
