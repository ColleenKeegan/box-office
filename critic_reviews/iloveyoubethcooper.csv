By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor July 11 2009 Save for later Saved In this film publicity image released by 20th Century Fox actors from left Paul Rust Lauren Storm Hayden Panettiere Jack T. Carpenter and Lauren London are shown in a scene from ""I Love You Beth Cooper."" Joe Lederer/20th Century Fox/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Bitter experience has taught me that any summer romantic comedy aimed at teens already has two strikes against it. If however you go into ""I Love You Beth Cooper"" with zero expectations its not half bad. Its directed by the terminally workmanlike Chris Columbus but the script by Larry Doyle based on his novel has some smart flashes and a few of the young performers resemble real people and not the usual prefab teen idols.The premise is a good one. Instead of spouting the usual boring homilies geeky high school class valedictorian Denis Cooverman (Paul Rust) urged on by his best friend Rich (Jack T. Carpenter) uses the occasion of his senior graduation address to proclaim his years-long crush on fellow classmate and head cheerleader Beth Cooper (Hayden Panettiere) who of course doesnt know he exists.Taken aback but also intrigued by his ardor Beth slowly warms to him as day passes into night. She is flanked by her two best friends cheerleaders Cammy (Lauren London) and Treece (Lauren Storm). Together they form a trinity right out of ""Mean Girls."" Except their meanness burns off rather quickly. You see this is a movie about locating the inner sweetness in all of us. Sometimes a cheerleader is more than a cheerleader. (Isnt it about time somebody organized an antidefamation league for cheerleaders?) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? In case you havent been paying attention just about every young adult comedy no matter how raunchy comes equipped these days with a handy moral message. From ""Knocked Up"" through ""Adventureland"" and beyond peace love and understanding rule the day. Traditionalism is in. Catting around is out. Doing right by your partner is applauded. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review I Love You Beth Cooper In ""Beth Cooper"" it doesnt take us long to figure out that Beth is more than a bimbo. Or to put it another way shes a bimbo with heart. Shes drawn to Denis because he adores her for who she is rather than (or in addition to) how she looks. This is in contrast to her beefcake boyfriend Kevin (Shawn Roberts) a military wacko who with his two wacko cohorts repeatedly hounds Denis in an attempt to humiliate him and get Beth back.Because the film is set in Tacoma Wash. (actually shot in Vancouver) the settings are unnaturally lush and woodsy for a teen genre pic. When Denis and Rich and the three girls are crammed into a Cabriolet whooshing through nighttime rural byways you can taste the minty freshness in the air. Their sense of freedom of leaving high school behind is palpable.However I wish the filmmakers hadnt turned Beths dreadful driving skills and her jokey penchant for turning off the headlights at night into a big fat joke. They also play for laughs a scene where she accidentally drives smack into Denis. Not only does he survive but he is able to laugh it off. Using characters as human crash dummies is not exactly the height of comic inspiration especially in a movie that is pushing sweetness over sinew.Doyle has been a writer and a producer for ""The Simpsons"" and written some very funny humor pieces for The New Yorker. He must be the main reason this film is better than it has any right to be. Whenever ""Beth Cooper"" is in ""Mean Girls"" mode whenever it resorts to standard-issue beer blast hijinks its routine and derivative. And Panettiere from TVs ""Heroes"" is rather vapid - as opposed to playing vapid. But Rust and Carpenter work extremely well together and Doyle has supplied them with some wonderful byplay. One of the films running gags - that Rich is gay but wont admit even to himself what everybody knows - is uncommonly heartfelt because of the way the actors handle the situation. In most movies you have to take for granted that the buddies really are buddies. Not here.Rust in particular is a real find. In his first starring role he shows off the crack timing of a seasoned pro. Although hes a smitten geek Denis is also a Stanford-bound premed whose head Beth aside is screwed on pretty straight. Hes a go-getter. If Rust reminds you a bit of the young Woody Allen its because Allen despite his dweeby goofy veneer was a go-getter too - a rascal.Its too bad ""Beth Cooper"" isnt even better. Doyle dumbs down his wit in a way he wouldnt do for say The New Yorker. With a little more tang and integrity this film might have been another ""Say Anything."" But with any luck Rust who already has several films in the can including the new Quentin Tarantino movie will become the Woody Allen or John Cusack or Dustin Hoffman - take your pick - of his generation. Grade B (Rated PG-13 for crude and sexual content language some teen drinking and drug references and brief violence.)

(20th Century Fox) Joe Neumaier DAILY NEWS MOVIE CRITIC Thursday July 9 2009 554 PM Title I Love You Beth Cooper I Love You Beth Cooper"" could be called an atrocity but that might suggest there was something in it that could be ruined. This unfunny unoriginal charmless teen comedy is so stunningly awful from start to finish its amazing to think its director has made a single film before much less a dozen.Chris Columbus has been derided for easy emotion and pedestrian filmmaking. Still his blockbusters - including the first two ""Harry Potter"" movies as well as ""Home Alone"" and ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" - indicate Columbus isnt clueless about what makes mainstream success. His last movie was ""Rent"" and ""Beth Cooper"" feels like it was made in the Port-O-John used on the ""Rent"" set. It stinks that bad. High school valedictorian Denis Cooverman (Paul Rust) takes advice from his buddy Rich (Jack T. Carpenter) and declares undying love for cheerleader Beth (Hayden Panettiere) in a graduation speech. He also insults various class members setting in motion a night in which the guys tag along with Beth and her girl pals as Beths hulking boyfriend stalks them. Come morning Denis sees Beth as more than just an object of desire. The zit-size plots nocturnal structure is blandly episodic and recalls Columbus first movie 1987s ""Adventures in Babysitting."" (Prior to that he wrote several Steven Spielberg-produced hits beginning with ""Gremlins."") Nothing in Larry Doyles script from his novel is amusing; scenes play out without pay-off and cliches from teen comedies of 20 years ago are recycled unironically. Car crash through a living room anyone? Anyone? Its hard to fault the actors when the material is this lame. Still Rust was likely cast for his huge nose and adenoidal delivery but this twentysomething actor looks alarmingly like a middle-age man (or younger version of 1940s star Eddie Bracken) and his halting wheezy delivery gets really irritating. Panettiere meanwhile is a void inside a vacuum wrapped in a blow-up doll. This child-performer-turned-TV star (""Heroes"") thinks or has been directed to believe that making punky-pouty grimaces and rolling her eyes passes for acting. Whats left? The boring suburban setting the ditz parents the unimaginative soundtrack (the kids sing along to Alice Coopers ""Schools Out"" which may have actually happened for three weeks in the early 70s). ""No one said it was supposed to be fun"" Beth says at one point. But did anyone say it was supposed to make your eyes bleed? jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"I Love You Beth Cooper - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-FilmMOVIE REVIEW I Love You Beth CooperThe teen movie is a rehash of many others as a nerd pursues an out-of-his-league cheerleader.July 10 2009|Mark Olsen ""I Love You Beth Cooper"" is not a remake -- it just feels like one. A flat tired rehash of teen movie story tropes the film attempts to have it both ways by winkingly acknowledging its secondhand origins. The distance from shameless rip-off to loving homage may not be far but it is a chasm this film fails to jump.Directed by Chris Columbus who made the first two ""Harry Potter"" films and adapted by one-time ""Simpsons"" writer Larry Doyle from his own novel the film opens on a high school graduation scene. In his valedictory speech ultra-nerd Denis Cooverman (Paul Rust) declares his love for the out-of-his-league head cheerleader (Hayden Panettiere) of the title.Social hierarchies are quickly established and obeyed as Cooverman has a sidekick who obsessively quotes from movies and Cooper has her own female sidekick counterparts. (Coovermans dad is even played by Alan Ruck familiar as the best friend from ""Ferris Buellers Day Off"" -- a nudge so unsubtle it leaves a bruise.) Coovermans brave foolish move sets in motion one wild night that includes chases and fights and parties and trying to buy booze and the losing of pants and jealous misunderstandings and unlikely hookups.The film is largely hampered by an indecisive tone. In particular violence is meted out with little to no repercussion -- Cooverman is beaten repeatedly falls from a roof is hit by a car and keeps a-going -- creating a cartoonish atmosphere that obstructs any genuine emotional momentum the filmmakers might want. Then there are the teasing intimations of sexiness -- a towel-drop from behind a fleeting female side-flash and one lasciviously licked cream pastry. The films one use of the ""F-word"" is to cadge a line from ""Risky Business."" Staying safely within the chaste confines of its PG-13 rating ""I Love You Beth Cooper"" is no ""Private Lessons.""The film though apparently set in the present day lacks the plugged-in vibrancy of recent teen films such as ""Superbad"" or the underrated ""The Girl Next Door"" leaving ""I Love You Beth Cooper"" feeling more like a sentimental look back than a more lively expression of contemporary youth. The storys main idea that Denis Coovermans best days lay ahead of him and that someone like Beth Cooper may have already peaked reeks of the wish fulfillment of a nerd-domination agenda.--calendarlatimes.com--I Love You Beth CooperMPAA rating PG-13 for crude and sexual content language some teen drinking and drug references and brief violenceRunning time 1 hour 42 minutesPlaying In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESWhy a screenwriting team adapted The Spectacular NowNovember 21 2013Miley Cyrus LOL gets little love from LionsgateApril 19 2012Ferris Buellers best friend grows up to be the worlds...July 9 2009A sweet surpriseAugust 17 2007MORE STORIES ABOUTFilmLoveCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-bethcooper10-2009jul10,0,2406597.story",200,iloveyoubethcooper4,iloveyoubethcooper,latimes

Stephen Cole From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jul. 09 2009 459PM EDT Last updated Friday Jul. 24 2009 313AM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Directed by Chris Columbus Written by Larry Doyle Starring Hayden Panettiere Paul Rust Jack Carpenter Lauren London and Lauren Storm Classification14A What ever happened to Jimmy Reardon? Where have you gone Ferris Bueller? As recently as the 1980s teenage film heroes were resilient adventurers - worthy heirs of the Great American Boy Tom Sawyer. Think of John Cusack in Say Anything or The Sure Thing  Tom Cruise in Risky Business  River Phoenix in A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon  or Matthew Broderick in Ferris Buellers Day Off . Then Jason Biggs got caught romancing the title pastry in American Pie (1999). That films success turned teen comedy into a hazing ritual. And so now in I Love You Beth Cooper  we have high-school valedictorian Denis Cooverman blowing his graduation speech by blurting out that he loves the head cheerleader. After that ""Denis the Penis"" is pulverized by Beths boyfriend knocked senseless by a champagne cork run over by a car ripped apart by a rose bush and left to wander a country road at night wearing only his lucky Spider-Man underwear. Oh and he also loses one of his baby teeth opening a beer. His baby teeth Denis is played by stand-up comedian Paul Rust ( Semi Pro ). Rust is probably an ordinary looking and sounding guy but here the comic has been dumbed down to Super Nerd wearing the same oversized Rugby shirt and expression (wincing as if anticipating a punch) the entire film. His voice is a seagulls caw. As mentioned the love of Deniss life is Beth Cooper (Hayden Panettiere). The acclaimed book upon which the movie is based probably made a great deal of how Beth like nerdy Denis is a victim of typecasting. Everyone figures shes a born-with-streaked-hair bimbo. A girl every boy wants - for one night only. The movie does that too but only intermittently. We get 20-25 minutes of speeding boorish behaviour. Beth and her two girlfriends run roughshod over Denis and his gay best buddy Rich (Jack Carpenter) to a soundtrack of squealing tires and Foreigner-Alice-Cooper-Kiss songs. Then orange light. Action slows. Cue the tinkling piano. Rich is told its okay to be gay. Beth allows that being head cheerleader is a career with an early expiry date. The trouble is that the film isnt convincing at either speed. Filmmaker Chris Columbus made his bones in the early nineties knocking off energetic family comedies - Home Alone Mrs. Doubtfire - but he lacks the funk and fury required to make a properly improper teen comedy. His new film feels curiously outdated. Why are these kids listening to and singing Alice Cooper songs? Theres even a cow-tipping scene And while its great to hear that being gay is okay in a Hollywood comedy the most homophobic of all film genres there is a draggy sincerity to I Love You Beth Cooper . The movie feels like something parents want their kids to see. Harold and Kumar wouldnt want anything to do with Beth Cooper or Denis Cooverman. Youre probably not going to like them much either.

PHOTOS Child Stars Then and Now But ""I Love You Beth Cooper"" the adventures of a class nerd who blurts out the title during his valedictory speech makes for a lively and refreshing glimpse into how the other half lives. It almost makes me regret all the times I stomped on the tracheas of debate dweebs. ""Sixteen Candles"" wasnt one of the funniest movies of the 80s but it was honest and touchingly pure. It lasted. ""I Love You Beth Cooper"" isnt especially hilarious but it has a warm sense of humor instead of a string of gross-out jokes. Itll be a cable mainstay. Beth -- she is named after the KISS song -- is the head cheerleader played by Hayden Panettiere practically head cheerleader of the nation by now. Shes startled by the graduation-day announcement by her toucan-nosed classmate Denis Cooverman (Paul Rust who is 28 but I forgive). She brings two friends to his house for a party that night anyway not to flirt but to have a laugh at Denis gangly nerdiness. The three girls are the only ones who show up though except for Denis Ducky-like sidekick Rich (Jack Carpenter) who keeps denying hes gay despite his tendency to describe a sneaker as ""very Gene Kelly circa 1945 dont you think?"" Beth is having a fight with her psycho older boyfriend a rageaholic soldier who patrols the neighborhood in a giant Hummer that blasts ""Ride of the Valkyries."" Soon the soldier and his crew are chasing the two guys and three girls deep into the suburban night. Based on a novel and script by ""The Simpsons"" writer Larry Doyle the Chris Columbus-directed movie doesnt add a lot of wrinkles to the long-wild-night format of ""American Graffiti"" ""Dazed and Confused"" and ""Superbad."" It does have a sheaf of quotable lines and a sometimes-piercing eye. Rich seems to think a brief same-sex kiss ""isnt gay -- its within the three-second rule"" while a sluttish girl murmurs ""Champagne makes me do . . . things."" A principal notes ""I cant let you kill him on school property."" Spider-Man underpants huggy bullies and a beatdown with a skeleton play important roles. As the brilliant-but-canceled TV series ""Freaks and Geeks"" showed getting high school right is as important as getting it funny. That means equal parts annihilating boredom and wistful nostalgia. ""So what are you thinking?"" says Denis. ""Nothing"" replies Beth. When she demonstrates a cheer a word need not be spoken to make it clear how poignant -- how ""Benjamin Button"" -- the situation is For Beth this is as good as it gets. Denis who is headed for Stanford has nothing but glory in his future. Only at this moment do their trajectories intersect. If they ever see each other again shell be serving him drinks. Which is why in a way Beth is as frustrated as Denis is. In one erratic episode she blurts ""Who said its supposed to be fun?"" Its a toss-up whether that remark is as sad as this one from Denis ""All my memories of high school are from tonight."" kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next YOO-HOO MRS.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post At the Buffalo Grove High School graduation valedictorian Denis Cooverman says what hes felt since the seventh grade. With sweaty palms and a tentative then wise delivery he publicly confesses his love for the schools head cheerleader. It surprises the object of adoration irks her Army-enlisted beau and gives ""I Love You Beth Cooper"" its hooky title. Paul Rust of the comic troupe the Upright Citizens Brigade plays Denis. ""Heroes"" star Hayden Panettiere shows bigger-screen promise as Beth. Flattered by Denis grand gesture and ready for easy sport Beth and her closest friends (Lauren London and Lauren Storm) arrive at Denis graduation party which consists of the host and best friend Rich (Jackson T. Carpenter). The arrival of a jealous and tweaked boyfriend sends the fivesome out into a night of mishaps disappointments and deeper bonding. TV scribe Larry Doyle who adapted his antic-rich novel said the setup came to him in a dream. Literally. He dreamed he was giving a commencement address and confessed his long-term crush on a student. When Denis does ditto its the films first (and nearly the only) sweetly original moment. Like the high schools bison mascot this romp is lean on fresh laughs. Still if youve never seen a high-school comedy ""I Love You Beth Cooper"" might serve as a genre primer. Here we find the familiar foils -- jocks nerds cheerleaders -- in the recognizable throes of the usual hang-ups bullying yearning and sexual teasing. Chris Columbus who made the winning if slapstick-brutal ""Home Alone"" directs. And the havoc Beths boyfriend Kevin (played with automaton clarity by Shawn Roberts) and his buddies wreak is over-the-top. Sure its cartoonish. But since theyre enlisted clean-cut thugs its too easy to read their abuses as cheap-- and dodgy -- commentary. Directed by Chris Columbus; written by Larry Doyle; starring Hayden Panettiere Paul Rust Jack T. Carpenter Lauren London Lauren Storm Shawn Roberts Alan Ruck Cynthia Stevenson. PG-13 for crude and sexual content language some teen drinking and drug references and brief violence. 1 hour 44 minutes. Opens today at area theaters.

Egged on by his best friend Rich (Jack T. Carpenter) Denis uses his moment at the podium to declare his love and also to blurt out a few unfiltered observations concerning several other students.Embarrassment ensues and then an unlikely night of soul-baring and boozing slugfests and car wrecks as Denis and Beth accompanied by Rich and by Beths two cheerleader pals discover their ""real"" selves.Despite Denis supposed ability to speak the truth and elicit it from others I Love You Beth Cooper never gets close to unmasking its high school stereotypes. And the charmlessness of its central characters - Rusts charisma-challenged Denis Panettieres Barbie-hard and vacuous Beth - makes this putative farce all the more difficult to endure.Not funny not fun.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

"I Love You Beth Cooper | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; i-love-you-beth-cooper ) I Love You Beth Cooper (United States 2009) July 09 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli I Love You Beth Cooper contains a share of effective elements wrapped around the core that overall isnt very good. Although masquerading as a generic teen romantic comedy the film touches on topics that are atypically introspective for this sort of production although it fails to delve into them in a manner that would elevate the proceedings to a higher level. The tone is an uneven brew of the satirical and the serious although the former lacks the edge to give it bite and the latter is only occasionally applied with conviction. The result feels at odds with itself and never fully satisfies. Theres a sense that a much better movie is trying to get out but it never attains escape velocity. Its graduation day for the seniors of Buffalo Grove High and valedictorian Denis Cooverman (Paul Rust) is about to deliver an unusual address. In it he professes unrequited love for the schools head cheerleader Beth Cooper (Hayden Panettiere). This delights Denis best friend Rich (Jack T. Carpenter) who is the instigator of Denis confession. Beth is conflicted - despite being embarrassed she finds the whole thing ""so sweet."" Her thuggish drugged-out boyfriend Kevin (Shawn Roberts) decides that ending Denis life might be the best way to resolve an unpleasant situation. Events conspire to group Denis Beth Rich and Beths two best friends Cammy (Lauren London) and Treece (Lauren Storm) together for the night. Their misadventures include avoiding Kevin when he launches an attack on Denis house breaking into the school for some fun in the showers turning up at the most popular party of the evening and spending time in a cabin in the woods. Out for blood Kevin is always in hot pursuit and both Beth and Denis discover things about their feelings for one another they werent expecting. The intended raunchy content has been watered down for PG-13 consumption. There is nudity but its of the peek-a-boo variety and it doesnt take a genius to guess what a ""deep kiss"" was originally designed to be. Director Chris Columbus a graduate of the John Hughes school of filmmaking (perhaps best known for handling the first two Harry Potter movies) avoids anything deeply scathing or controversial. Although I Love You Beth Cooper doesnt quite fit neatly into the teenage romantic comedy mold it comes close with titles like Risky Business and The Girl Next Door being appropriate antecedents. (The Tom Cruise movie is even mentioned explicitly.) Of course neither of those films can boast a scene in which the characters venture into a pasture to do some cow-tipping and one steps in a steaming pile of manure. Its moments like this - and there are a few others - that do irreparable damage to I Love You Beth Coopers attempts to be ""more."" Despite being ten years beyond high school graduation age Paul Rust is well-cast as the uber-nerdy Denis. I Love You Beth Cooper is Rusts coming-out party but this is not his only screen credit of the summer he can also be seen in Inglorious Basterds in which one hopes the screenplay and director better serve him. Hayden Panettiere is best-known for her role in the TV series Heroes although her acting career stretches back much farther. She shows impressive range here essentially having to play three versions of Beth Cooper the image that attracts the eyes and stirs the hormones of all the boys in school (including Denis); the scary reckless one who pushes boundaries and buttons; and the ""real"" girl behind all the curtains. Panettiere integrates the three into one which is a more adept task than one might imagine. The performance is better than the movie deserves. One of my recurrent complaints about romantic comedies is the lack of conversation between the leads. Falling in love in a movie consists of argument as foreplay followed by deep meaningful stares and heartfelt confessions of undying affection. Dialogue is a rarity and substantive dialogue almost never occurs. I Love You Beth Cooper does two things right in this arena Denis and Beth actually say things to each other and they do not fall victim to ""happily ever after"" romance. They are after all teenagers. Denis must replace the idealized Beth around which his fantasies have been built with an image of someone more human and vulnerable and Beth must see Denis as more than a caricature. Unfortunately I Love You Beth Cooper doesnt just chronicle this joint emotional journey; it throws in a lot of crap that distracts detracts annoys and ultimately takes over. Its hard to imagine any way in which jettisoning Kevin would not have improved the story. In addition while ""friends"" are mandatory accessories in teen movies Rich Cammy and Treece often feel like extraneous appendages. I Love You Beth Cooper recognizes that for a teenager high school graduation stands at the nexus between past and future. For some like Beth high school is the high point of life - a period when her position at the top of the student popularity pyramid provides her with the illusion of greatness. For others like Denis high school is a necessary transition between childhood and a promising future. Their divergent perspectives define how they interact with each other during this night. Sadly the film doesnt do nearly as much as it could with this material. Theres a sense that I Love You Beth Cooper has been smoothed out and dumbed down to reach the broadest audience. (Not having read the novel by Larry Doyle who also penned the screenplay I cant say for sure.) As good as some of the bonding material is thats how unfortunate many of the so-called comedic and generic story elements are. I Love You Beth Cooper is schizophrenic - two very different movies uneasily occupying the same space and time. One of them has promise; the other is annoying and off-putting. The filmmakers lacked the courage and conviction to tell an honest character-based story and resorted to something that has been massaged into a more comfortable easily consumable cinematic morsel. Too bad the inevitable result of ingesting this is heartburn.

Media San Francisco Chronicle I Love You Beth Cooper Comedy. Starring Hayden Panettiere Paul Rust Jack Carpenter and Shawn Roberts. Directed by Chris Columbus. (PG-13. 102 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Genre films - particularly ones featuring teens - have a shorter shelf life than other movies. Just as John Hughes put the ""Porkys"" franchise out of business the Judd Apatow-produced ""Superbad"" makes ""I Love You Beth Cooper"" seem quaint and a bit out of style. ""Beth Cooper"" isnt a terrible addition to the teen coming-of-age party movie catalog. It just feels dated. Its the cinematic equivalent of the Whitesnake album that came out after Nirvanas ""Nevermind"" topped the charts. Why even bother? The answer becomes clearer upon learning that the filmmaker is San Franciscos Chris Columbus who directed the Hughes-penned ""Home Alone"" films in the early 1990s. His new movie is filled with nods to Hughes including the casting of ""Ferris Buellers Day Off"" co-star Alan Ruck as the protagonists dad and a brief yet clever homage to the ""Sixteen Candles"" auto shop scene between Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall.

Carpenter and Lauren London are shown in a scene from ""I Love You Beth Cooper."" Photo Joe Lederer AP Review I Love You Beth Cooper is just dated 1 / 2 Back to Gallery But he also throws in some broad slapstick leaving one character hanging off the gutter of a two-story house then losing his shoe in a pile of cow feces. There are rich kids acting stuck up and nerds getting tossed around by jock types. How many Michael Cera movies have to come out before people realize that being good at math is way cooler than being a lacrosse star? ""Beth Cooper"" begins promisingly with a valedictorian speech from geeky Denis Cooverman (Paul Rust) who declares his love for hot cheerleader Cooper (Hayden Panettiere). Its a well-written scene and the predictable follow-up involving her boyfriend and other insulted students is handled nicely. Cooper doesnt think much of her admirer but she realizes that the peak of her life is ending and the Stanford-bound Coovermans is just beginning. So she hangs out with him during a night of post-graduation partying. From there Cooverman gets bullied and embarrasses himself while occasionally stopping to get to know Cooper a little better. Her two character traits are looking hot and driving dangerously but we know shes a really good person inside mostly because were told that her brother died of cancer. Coovermans best friend might as well be named Duckie and his parents are the understanding types that both ground and congratulate their kid when he stays out all night with a hot girl. Rust as Cooverman tries a little too hard and his clumsiness and insecurity are overplayed. The actor is also in his late 20s which is a distraction - although the world did need a fourth face to join Luke Perry Justin Long and Ralph Macchio on the Mount Rushmore of old guys playing high school kids a decade after their last real pep rally. But ""I Love You Beth Cooper"" loses all credibility when five high school seniors in a car start singing along to ""Schools Out for Summer"" without missing a word. No teen kids in a movie have known all the lyrics to that song since the ""Dazed and Confused"" kids had their last beer blast in the park. -- AdvisoryHey hey hey hey Ooo ooo ooo oh wah Dont you forget about the sexual references crude language profanity and violence.

Adapted by Larry Doyle from his 2007 novel ""I Love You Beth Cooper"" peaks early -- like during the first three minutes -- and rapidly goes downhill from there. Attempting to create an ""American Graffiti"" for the current teen generation director Chris Columbus squanders a fertile premise with a loud series of episodic gags so much so that by the time a few moments of genuine sweetness belatedly arrive the pic has exhausted any goodwill. Hayden Panettiere (""Heroes"") is the primary draw as the movies poster girl but thats a slim PG-13 come-on to the young guys representing ""Beth Coopers"" best hope. Of course Panettiere plays an indestructible cheerleader in her TV series and she neednt stretch much here as a surprisingly vulnerable one -- the not-very-subtle ""Breakfast Club""-esque message being that high school stereotypes are not necessarily all they appear. With apologies to ""Heroes"" if only saving this cheerleader could salvage the movie -- or for that matter if only Columbus had found a way to relate Doyles story with greater style and in less than 102 laborious minutes. High school valedictorian Denis Cooverman (Paul Rust) -- prodded by his movie-obsessed maybe-gay best friend Rich (Jack T. Carpenter) -- decides to ""seize the day"" at graduation and say exactly what he thinks. That includes not only expressing his long-simmering admiration for Panetierres Ms. Cooper -- the girl he has worshipped from afar -- but telling off her muscle-bound ROTC boyfriend Kevin (Shawn Roberts) and calling out the school bully a stuck-up diva and so on. The fallout from that uncharacteristic burst of boldness and honesty could have potentially made for an interesting movie. Instead ""Beth Cooper"" devolves into an all-in-one-night graduation romp -- mostly encouraged by Denis dad an appropriately cast Alan Ruck -- that simply feels pallid next to ""Superbad"" and other edgier coming-of-age comedies that these days all seem somehow connected to the prolific mind of Judd Apatow. Basically Beth and her pom-pom pals Cammy and Treece (Lauren London and Lauren Storm respectively) that comprise the ""trinity"" show up at Denis house leading him and Rich on a madcap evening with Kevin in hot pursuit. Denis is said to be bound for Stanford and eventually med school which is good since an assortment of rapidly healing cuts and bruises follow. As constructed its almost as if Richard Dreyfuss ""Graffiti"" character actually caught up with that dream blonde in the convertible -- only to discover that once he did there was nothing much left to do or talk about other than race through Vancouvers wooded areas. Rust is certainly nerdy enough and Panettiere does what she can with whats really more an object than a fleshed-out personality. The same goes for Storm as her promiscuous bubble-headed friend -- a near-bright spot who might be more amusing if her dialogue was less predictable -- and Carpenters Rich forced to keep proclaiming his heterosexuality while enthusiastically quoting from classic movies that are significantly better than the one were watching. ""No regrets"" Denis states during his impassioned address in which he urges his peers to seize their moment. For the young thats always an appealing thought but one suspects ""Beth Cooper"" will nevertheless leave plenty of regrets behind all around.

"I Love You Beth Cooper Not much to love | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentI Love You Beth Cooper Not much to loveWith its painfully awkward shifts between pat sentimentality hackneyed teen-movie tropes and parent-baiting raunchiness theres little to love about I Love You Beth Cooper .Hayden Panettiere middle with Lauren London and Treece Kilmer.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Jason AndersonSpecial to the StarFri. July 10 2009(out of 4)Starring Hayden Panettiere Paul Rust and Jack Carpenter. Directed by Chris Columbus. 101 minutes. At TK theatres. 14A With its painfully awkward shifts between pat sentimentality hackneyed teen-movie tropes and parent-baiting raunchiness theres little to love about I Love You Beth Cooper. Like last falls Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist its an adaptation of a well-regarded young-adult novel whose contents are sometimes very adult by nature. In other words its teenage characters are no strangers to sex booze drugs or the lyrics to Alice Coopers ""Schools Out.""But director Chris Columbus displays as little affinity for the lives of contemporary teens as he does for the subtleties in Larry Doyles screenplay which the writer adapted from his own book. Article Continued BelowI Love You Beth Coopers opening scene is also snappy enough to suggest that things couldve turned out differently here. The kind of dork that even the teenaged Anthony Michael Hall wouldve wailed on our hero Denis Cooverman (Paul Rust) uses his valedictory address to his high schools graduating class as an opportunity to confess his feelings for Beth (Heroes heroine Hayden Panettiere) a cheerleader who barely knew he existed. Shes embarrassed by Deniss declaration but rather more forgiving about it than her army-cadet boyfriend Kevin (Shawn Roberts). His rage is stoked further when Beth and her pals accept Deniss invitation to a party at his house much to the surprise of the host and his sexually confused best friend Rich (Jack Carpenter). After Kevin arrives with the intent to damage Denis the two geeks flee with the girls for an evenings worth of destructive hijinks. Their agenda includes everything from car accidents to underage drinking to a menage-a-trois to an attempt to tip a cow. Along the way Beths suitor discovers that she is far less perfect than he has imagined her to be. In turn she sees something in Denis that the audience certainly doesnt.Just as Deniss pal Rich is overly eager to quote lines from his favourite films (his Jack Nicholson impersonation is especially poor) Columbus seems intent on stitching I Love You Beth Cooper together from scenes lifted from the teen classics of yesteryear - Sixteen Candles Weird Science and even Porkys figure prominently in the mix. (The appearance of Alan Ruck as Deniss dad provides a link to Ferris Buellers Day Off too.)Even the most ardent devotees of Panettiere can disregard that Heroes line about saving the cheerleader and save their time and money instead.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Humorless Beth Cooper wont be so popular for long - USATODAY.com Cars  Auto Financing  Event Tickets  Jobs  Real Estate  Online Degrees Shopping SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Life >> Movies Box Office Report Movie Listings Awards Central Shop for Movies/DVDs Humorless Beth Cooper wont be so popular for long Updated  | Review  | Recommend E-mail | Print | Enlarge By Joe Lederer 20th Century Fox Surprising developments And a not-so-hidden stash of condoms is the least of them for Rich (Jack T. Carpenter) and Beth Cooper (Hayden Panettiere). ABOUT THE MOVIEI Love You Beth Cooper  (out of four)Stars Hayden Panettiere Paul Rust Jack T. Carpenter Lauren London Lauren StormDirector Chris ColumbusDistributor 20th Century FoxRating PG-13 for crude and sexual content language some drinking and drug references and brief violenceRunning time 1 hour 46 minutesOpens Friday nationwide WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Beware the hazards of TMI. Too much information as delivered by a nerdy high school valedictorian in I Love You Beth Cooper leads to a raucous night that should be amusing and fun but feels forced and witless. This leaden teen comedy is meant to be lively but its curiously bland invigorated only by the offbeat humor of Jack T. Carpenter who plays Rich the valedictorians best pal. Based on the young-adult novel of the same name by Larry Doyle the movie has too few flashes of originality relying instead on formula. Denis (Paul Rust) is a geeky high school grad bound for Stanford. He has long nursed a crush on the popular Beth (Hayden Panettiere). Egged on by his buddy Rich Denis professes his amorous feelings during his valedictory speech. Then he publicly lays into several others at the school inciting the ire of the bullying Kevin (Shawn Roberts) who also happens to be Beths boyfriend. For a bright guy Denis lacks some essential common sense. After his soul-baring speech Denis awkwardly invites Beth to a party at his house. Though she was embarrassed by his admission of affection she shows up with a couple friends in tow. None of this makes much sense. Theres a particularly unfunny performance by Lauren Storm who plays Treece a bimbo who will do anything after having a few beers. She makes some jokes about her family but her quips are either disturbing or unintentionally sad. The characters lack charm and dimension falling into stereotypical molds. Joyless scenarios bounce between scenes of driving around town and predictable party mayhem. As high school comedies go I Love You Beth Cooper is barely likable.

(Joe Lederer) By Ty Burr Globe Staff / July 10 2009 Email| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + ""I Love You Beth Cooper is unusual in that its the rare teen stu-com - shorthand for ""stupid comedy a proud lineage that goes back to ""Porkys and beyond - thats based on a novel. On the other hand maybe not so unusual since author Larry Doyle has written for ""The Simpsons and ""Beavis and Butt-Head (and The New Yorker OK?) and he comes clean about his love for all things John Hughes in the quotes that open each chapter. So what we have here is a cross-media repurposing of teen movies mulched through Doyles head onto the page then remulched by him and director Chris Columbus back onto film.The results not surprisingly taste like mulch. ""I Love You Beth Cooper is one of those long-graduation-night-of-the-teenage-soul comedy dramas (""American Graffiti and ""Dazed and Confused remain the platinum standard) in which geek woos golden girl and everything goes fantastically wrong before it goes outrageously right. Theres no denying the movie starts out as in the book with a bang High school senior Denis Cooverman (played by 28-year-old Paul Rust) decides to use his valedictorian speech to go out in a blaze of glory proclaiming his undying love for head cheerleader Beth Cooper (Hayden Panettiere).In the same speech he namechecks and pop-analyzes the schools bully (Josh Emerson) psycho military freak (Shawn Roberts) and bitchy queen bee (Marie Avgeropoulos) before outing his own best friend Rich (Jack T. Carpenter). Rust whos quite good behind his enormous beak of a nose expertly conveys the sweat-flop thrill of burning all your bridges in public - the scenes propulsively funny because you have no idea where its going to end.It does end though and takes the rest of the movie with it. Beth contemptuously amused turns up at Deniss house with her two BFF minions ditzy Treece (Lauren Storm) and dead-eyed Cammie(Lauren London). Shortly following is her boyfriend Kevin the aforementioned psycho G.I. Joe who with his own steroid toadies chases Denis Rich and the girls throughout the suburban evening. There are stops at the liquor store the girls locker room the queen bees party various unlit back roads. A Hummer gets driven through a picture window. A raccoon is made to look like a feral killer through the use of computer-generated fangs. Yes again.""I Love You Beth Cooper in other words is a rehash of teen-comedy conventions that occasionally comes within shouting distance of its 80s-era inspirations. Carpenters character is a film geek dropping classic lines of dialogue none of the others even recognize (been there) and when he references Curtis Armstrong in ""Risky Business you realize thats what this movie wants to be one of those crummy yet witty ""Savage Steve Holland comedies Armstrong made with John Cusack back in the day ""Better Off Dead or ""One Crazy Summer. For ""Ferris Buellers Day Off fans theres even the blissful sight of that movies Alan Ruck - scha-winggg battah - as the heros cool-jerk dad.Heres what I cant figure out though Why invite Chris Columbus to this party? Hes a well-rewarded studio hack who can and has brought major properties successfully to the screen - ""Home Alone the first two ""Harry Potter films - without a hint of personality or genuine moviemaking passion. You can tell he gets the jokes and likes the characters in ""Beth Cooper but hes unable to stitch the scenes together with any comic momentum. The movie keeps building and flat-lining building and flat-lining botching (among other things) the subplot about whether the best friend is or isnt gay. You leave wondering if anyone involved with ""Beth Cooper has even met anyone whos gay.Panettiere Im sad to report is a dud as the title character a supposed wild thang who never rises above the level of runty obnoxious mall chick down to the roll-on tan. (Storm and London register much more strongly as her friends.) The movie takes pains to humanize this dull mannequin while making cruel sport of the ugly girl (Anna Mae Routledge) Denis is ashamed he ever dated. Heres an idea please Can some woman repurpose her high school years and finally stick it to all the geeky boys who grew up and made it in Hollywood? (c) Copyright 2009 Globe Newspaper Company.

Superbrave Then he speaks his mind to other high school archetypes including the school bully the class rich bitch Beths bulldog of an older boyfriend and Denis own drama-loving best friend who hasnt declared his sexual orientation leaving his classmates to declare it for him. The movie directed with modesty by Home Alone and Harry Potter helmer Chris Columbus from a swell book and screenplay by comic writer Larry Doyle (Buffalo Grove class of 76) follows the fallout from Denis barn-burning speech -- a cheery night to-remember comedy of outlandish unlikely coincidences and lively mishaps culminating in the shared witness of a sweet hope-streaked sunrise. The story is timeless; this could have taken place when Doyle graduated in 76 -- or any year really since the effects of high school linger throughout adult life and nerds are forever.

Share Tweet Based on the novel by former Simpsons writer Larry Doyle (who also scripted) I Love You Beth Cooper opens with a high-school super-nerd boldly declaring his long-unspoken love for the head cheerleader during his valedictory speech. Its a supremely clueless moment in a supremely clueless movie but it sets up a potentially interesting dilemma What will happen when gulp he actually has to speak to her? How might the real girl square with the fantasy? After the movies over thats still an open question because Doyle and director Chris Columbus peel back the fantasy of a untouchable beauty to reveal another fantasy--that of a Manic Pixie Dream Girl who sprinkles fairy dust on the heros head and drags him into adulthood by his Spider-Man Underoos. Theres hardly an authentic second in the film. A shotgun marriage between the extreme awkwardness of Judd Apatow comedies and ancient jock-vs.-nerd battles from 80s John Hughes or Revenge Of The Nerds I Love You Beth Cooper takes place in a world no modern teenager will recognize. After confessing his love to sparkle-eyed Hayden Panettiere at graduation Paul Rust and ambiguously gay best friend Jack Carpenter retreat to Rusts place for a house party with no expected guests. When Panettiere shows up with two hot friends Rust entertains the group by making a fool out of himself--dont trust a bungling doofus with a champagne bottle--but everyone has to flee in terror when her psychotic ROTC boyfriend and his buddies come around. What follows is a dusk-til-dawn coming-of-age story in the Dazed And Confused tradition though thats all the two films have in common. Columbus doesnt go for subtle observation when sitcom cartoonishness will do; whenever the film unleashes one of its cutesy flashbacks the adolescents inevitably have Coke-bottle glasses zit-pocked faces and more steel on their teeth than Jaws in Moonraker. Columbus love of the obvious gag--Carpenter shows off his new shoes in reel two for the sole purpose of stepping around cow patties in reel four--sabotages the budding connection between Rust and Panettiere in spite of the insistent pleadings of the wall-to-wall music score. Much like Hughes The Breakfast Club I Love You Beth Cooper tries to exploit and explode broad stereotypes but it never transcends the labels it applies.

Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review I Love You Beth Cooper -- 1 out of 5 stars I Love You Beth Cooper 20th Century Fox A geeky high school valedictorian tells it like it is in his graduation speech. July 10. A geeky high school valedictorian tells it like it is in his graduation speech. July 10. (20th Century Fox) Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Oh to have teenage kids just so I could forbid them to see I Love You Beth Cooper.A miscast and misjudged graduation-night comedy Cooper occasionally -- only occasionally -- wanders into ""harmless."" Much of the time its sending bad messages about oh driving without your lights on after dark using sex to score beer and letting peer pressure determine your sexuality. Lets state emphatically that Americas teens are too smart to do most of those things. Lets also state they probably wont find much to laugh at in this emphatically unfunny comedy from the guy who owes his career to Home Alone. Paul Rust is the charmless uncharismatic lead Denis a nerd who uses his valedictory speech to tell his classmates what he really thinks of them. And that girl he has lusted for but never ever spoken to? She ( Hayden Panettiere) gets his punch line.""I love you Beth Cooper."" She is flattered and over the course of a long and tedious graduation night Denis and his pal Rich (Jack Carpenter) whom he outed in his speech follow Beth and ""The Trinity"" (Lauren London and the hilarious Lauren Storm) as Beth drives her Yaris like a long lost Andretti flees her maniacal military boyfriend and knocks herself off the pedestal Denis put her on.The reason this was made was to escort young Panettiere from ""cutie"" to ""hottie."" But did they need the lame cocaine jokes the military bashing the parents (Alan Ruck Cynthia Stevenson) playing hide-the-vibrating-cell-phone?There is no way to discuss this movie without wondering if there has ever been a more successful awful director than Chris Columbus. The movie was adapted by the fellow who wrote the novel Larry Doyle and is so tone-deaf as to make one fear for American publishing. And the woebegone Rust the poor mans McLovin is ill-suited for this in so many ways that you dont even have to get into his appearance -- no timing no sparkle zero chemistry with Hayden.At least this should quickly become one of those blips on Panettieres resume a Leprechaun for the New Jennifer Aniston to roll her eyes about on Conans couch a few years down the road.

I Love You Beth Cooper Director Chris Columbus. Cast Paul Rust Hayden Panettiere Jack T. Carpenter. Rating PG-13 for crude and sexual content language some teen drinking and drug references and brief violence. Great Good Fair Bad Bomb Related Hayden Panettiere is back in uniform Teen movies That certainly seems to be the case with ""I Love You Beth Cooper."" Beak-nosed Paul Rust (""Semi-Pro"") plays Denis Cooverman who uses his high-school valedictory address to declare his unrequited passion for the cheerleading captain played by bland beauty Hayden Panettiere of TVs ""Heroes."" ""I loved you from behind"" he says in an unintentional entendre that foreshadows the level of cleverness to come in a wild night of sight gags and PG-13 crudity. Theres a raccoon attack an attempted cow-tipping and a climactic towel-snapping battle with the obligatory bully. A handful of moments are genuinely funny as when Beths steroidally enhanced boyfriend uses a pair of skeleton arms as nunchuks to slap Denis silly and Rust does a good job of capturing the excruciating vulnerability of a high-school outcast. But every time the story shows some glimmer of originality it immediately retreats back to formula. The comedy is by the numbers and lacks the kind of oh-no-you-didnt daring that made 2007s ""Superbad"" a standout in this overdone genre. The characters are equally lackluster with the exception of best buddy Rich Munsch a gracefully geeky movie buff who spends most of the night trying to convince everyone that he isnt gay. It could be a breakout role for actor Jack T. Carpenter who brings such natural laid-back charm to the screen that he makes Beth and her party-girl sidekicks seem even more like lifeless mannequins. Although there are some obvious attempts to connect with the current generation of plugged-in teens with references to iPods and Facebook theres no disguising the fact that ""Beth Cooper"" is a rehash. The flick is a thinly disguised exercise in nostalgia right down to the music Theres the ""Waynes World""-style sing-along to Alice Coopers ""Schools Out"" for one. And then theres the big emotional moment set to the Kiss power ballad ""Beth"" which every one of the teenage characters instantly recognizes even though they werent born when it was a hit in 1976. Uncoincidentally thats the year that screenwriter Larry Doyle graduated high school. Were guessing he didnt get the girl. Reach the reporter at kerry.lengelarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4896.

Or have to pony up for an emergency organ transplant? Even if so Im not sure it fully excuses this joyless offensively stupid end-of-high-school farce set into motion when nerdy valedictorian Dennis Cooverman (Paul Rust) uses his commencement address to profess his unrequited love for the titular cheerleading goddess (Hayden Panettiere). Complications ensue as the numinous Ms. Cooper pays a grad-night visit chez Cooverman with two gal pals in tow and a coked-up Army brat boyfriend (Shawn Roberts) in hot pursuit. Cue the listless succession of house trashings party crashings realizations that beautiful people can be insecure too and enough reckless driving to result in a double-digit body count--fitting for a movie thats about as funny as a hit-and-run. At least Columbus and writer Larry Doyle are up-front about their inspirations giving Dennis a film-geek BFF (Jack T. Carpenter) who name-checks Risky Business and a dad played by none other than Ferris Bueller wingman Alan Ruck. But why no love for Columbuss own 1987 debut feature Adventures in Babysitting which went through these same one-wild-night paces with real ingenuity and pizzazz--and less need to persistently debase its characters? ""This isnt fun anymore"" says the wise young Cooverman after his third or fourth near-death experience. ""Who says its supposed to be fun?"" replies his unattainable lady love. Exactly.
