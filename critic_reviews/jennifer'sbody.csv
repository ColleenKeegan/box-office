However by going against the grain of the 80s horror movies to which it pays affectionate homage - Carrie Fright Night slasher movies in general - the script by Juno writer Diablo Cody explores the toxic friendship between Jennifer and her nerdy speccy bosom buddy Needy (Amanda Seyfried). Sandbox love never dies so they are best friends forever. But when Jennifers encounter with a diabolical indie band ends with her being sacrificed and transformed into a literally maneating demon Needy must see through her one-sided girl-crush in order to end Jennifers bloody reign of terror. A welcome antidote to the sexless romanticism of Twilight Kusama and Codys female-driven horror comedy explores the premise that hell is a teenage girl. When the far from virginal Jennifer transforms she simply becomes herself but more so her sexual power is magnified she glows with health after feeding and her cruel selfishness goes into overdrive. But not even Needys sensitive boyfriend Chip (Johnny Simmons) will believe that Jennifers body is now the embodiment of evil. There are weaknesses Kusamas set-piece scare scenes arent always frightening Codys trademark teen slang is occasionally more forced than arch and the mysterious psychic connection between Jennifer and Needy is never explained. But by tapping in to the same vein of hormonal horror as the excellent Ginger Snaps this offers a witty subversive look at the darker side of teen friendship.

It is however if taken lightly a bit of fun and worth a watch. As has been noted by many Megan Fox is never going to be winning any Awards for her on screne ability. But she is a very good looking woman and thats what the role required so she filled that role more than adequatly. The film was a little different to the Horror genres that have gone before but i doubt its one that will move on or develop into anything more interesting. Films that have mixed Horror and Comedy such as Shaun of the Dead this is not; but its worth a watch.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 16 2009Thomas NoctorFeaturedI watched this film in my hotel room in Chicago because I was bored.

And its got Megan Fox ... Its nice to see a supernatural monster which looks human (and attractive) and isnt a vampire- vampires are great but its nice to have a bit of variety.

How many horror films are there that have convincing female characters as both the main force of evil and heroine? How many films for by and about women that dont focus boringly on shoes diets and being rescused by a knight in shining armour? This is Mean Girls with a horror twist. Delicious stuff.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 3 2009SeyiFeaturedOne of the worst movies ive seen this year. The trailer gives you the impression that youd be scared but at the same time glued to your seat. It couldnt be more wrong. The story line is shallow and even though the actors tried to pull it off the movie is a miserable flop. I wouldnt recommend it for anyone. Even as a download. Its so not worth the space on a laptop. Very disappointed.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 1 2009PaulFeaturedI took my teenage daughter to see this film and we both reached the same conclusion that it stank and was a car crash of a film Apparently it is a poor rip off of some of the Twilight story lines and the film reminded me of The Twilight Zone. If you go expecting to be titillated by Megan Fox then stick to the trailer which makes the film seem good. The mandatory shots of Megan in shorts are there and of course the glossed lips you want to lick and then stick her to the wall.

Comments (6) click to enlarge Jennifers Body 2009 Jennifers Body has a basic rape-revenge plot. Early in the film stuck-up high-school princess Jennifer (Megan Fox) is brutalized by a bunch of guys (though not explicitly raped); late in the film the guys get their long-telegraphed bloody comeuppance. Writer Diablo Cody (Juno) and director Karyn Kusama though want you to know that theyre smarter and hipper than that suggests so they carefully distance both of these primal scenes through devices like ironically narrated flashback. Alas as it turns out being clever with your exploitation tropes tends to just make them boring--especially if youre not actually all that clever. The movie wanders about searching for a suitable replacement--the evil transformation from Christine? The deadly prom from Carrie? Special effects from the Exorcist? BFF jealousy from Single White Female? Women-in-prison films? Anything? Cody gets off a couple of good lines (""shes actually evil not high school evil"") and theres a gleefully oleaginous performance by Adam Brody as a black-souled (but still sensitive) indie rocker. Overall though the flashes of competence just emphasize the extent to which the film has no idea what its doing.

"Reviews American Casino Jennifers Body and more - LA Times ENTERTAINMENT ENTERTAINMENT Reviews American Casino Jennifers Body and more American Casino Rock Table Films / Argot Pictures ""American Casino"" a documentary directed by Leslie cockburn examines the effects of the subprime mortgage crisis and the banking meltdown. ""American Casino"" a documentary directed by Leslie cockburn examines the effects of the subprime mortgage crisis and the banking meltdown. (Rock Table Films / Argot Pictures) Though theres likely a stronger documentary than ""American Casino"" to be made about the recent Wall Street collapse and subprime mortgage disaster its still hard not to be shocked by this stranger-than-fiction look at how a toxic mix of unbridled greed mass financial manipulation and the probable effect of a 2000 government deregulation act upended our nations entire economy.Director Leslie Cockburn who wrote and produced the film with her journalist husband Andrew reportedly shot as the housing market meltdown and megabuck bank and insurance company bailouts were literally unfolding. While this lends the project a kind of you-are-there timeliness the movie also feels as if the Cockburns created its structure as they went along. The result is a lopsided visually uninspired film that works best when it eschews the complex numbers-crunching of its financial industry pundits and whistle-blowers to profile the everyday victims of the crisis. These include primarily several Baltimore-area African Americans who were among the many minority home buyers targeted for exploitive high-rate wildly confusing subprime loans. These hard-working folks emotionally charged stories of losing their houses life savings and dignity because of predatory lending practices (an extended tour of a teachers up-for-auction home is especially heartbreaking) could have and perhaps should have filled their very own documentary.-- Gary Goldstein ""American Casino."" MPAA rating Unrated. Running time 1 hour 29 minutes. At Laemmles Music Hall Beverly Hills. Whats slang for not very scary?What the horror genre gained in pop rejuvenation when the ""Scream"" movies peppered in added humor -- the referential laughs as unexpected as the shocks -- it has since lost in so many wink-wink copycats. Oscar-winning ""Juno"" screenwriter Diablo Cody does her slanguage-laden best to make ""Jennifers Body"" -- about a high school hottie (Megan Fox) turned boy-chomping demon -- into a femme-tastic anti-""Carrie"" but her glib teen-hip dialogue mostly feels like self-conscious splatter over a sorely lackluster scare flick.Its a bloody shame because there are glimmers of something more emotionally interesting in the increasingly fraught relationship between mean-queen Jennifer and plain-Jane best pal Needy. Fox is almost too well cast as Jennifer -- her Boop-ishly snarky line readings hardly surprising -- but thankfully the part of Needy has been tasked to the appealing Amanda Seyfried an actress able to reach past Codys tone-busting one-liners and connect on a basic what-the-hell-happened-to-my-friend level.Director Karyn Kusama meanwhile having moved from ""Girlfight"" to girlfright does manage the nifty task of giving her lead characters one-night-only dalliance an old-fashioned same-sexploitative zing but she cant muster up a modicum of suspense elsewhere. ""Jennifers Body"" held promise but its decidedly more self-possessed than possessed.-- Robert Abele ""Jennifers Body."" MPAA rating R for sexuality bloody violence language and brief drug use. Running time 1 hour 41 minutes. In general release.Absurd life in the West BankThe taxi driver behind the wheel for the 71-minute duration of Palestinian filmmaker Rashid Masharawis absurdist tragicomedy ""Lailas Birthday"" is categorically unfit for the job. Taking fares around the West Bank city of Ramallah the prickly and proper Abu Laila (Arab actor Mohammed Bakri) refuses to drive to checkpoints and wont pick up anyone carrying weapons.""You are robbing yourself man"" one customer complains when Abu Laila points to a sign in his ride reading ""No AK47s."" ""Half of the country wears arms; the other half cant afford to take a taxi.""Masharawis film revels in the irrational beginning with the notion that Abu Laila is forced to drive a cab in the first place. He is in fact a judge but the government has run out of money so Abu Laila is stuck enforcing his own law of the land while motoring around Ramallah in his brother-in-laws cab.""Lailas Birthday"" presents a particularly demented day in the life of this woebegone hero methodically laying out the corruption chaos and small gnawing frustrations that characterize life in the West Bank. The girl in the title is Abu Lailas daughter (Nour Zoubi) and yes shes celebrating her seventh birthday so her father needs to be home to deliver the cake.Masharawi saves his fist-shaking until the very end but he neednt have bothered. His camera captures the senselessness of life in this city under siege in a way that words cannot.-- Glenn Whipp ""Lailas Birthday."" MPAA rating Unrated. Running time 1 hour 21 minutes. In Arabic with English subtitles. At Laemmles Music Hall Beverly Hills.50 tableaux about life and death""You the Living"" is not as surreal or apocalyptic as Swedish filmmaker Roy Anderssons 2002 film ""Songs From the Second Floor"" which envisions no less than the collapse of Western civilization from some kind of mysterious implosion. This time out Andersson delves into the comic aspect of everyday human miseries and frustrations. His film is composed of more than 50 tableaux most of them filmed in large drab sets shot in wide angle with minimal camera movement and soft shadowless lighting -- so that in Anderssons words ""nobody has a place to hide.""Vignettes proceed from one to another in random fashion and although the film develops a measured even majestic rhythm its structure makes it demanding even wearying in less involving moments. Attention however is rewarded with episodes that are worthy of comparison with those of the silent-era masters Buster Keaton in particular. Especially delicious is a nightmare sequence in which a man dreams he is at a family dinner party and is determined to demonstrate that he can pull out a tablecloth without disturbing the 200-plus-year-old china sitting upon it. The poor guy meets disaster and faces the electric chair. A kindly executioner actually counsels the distraught man by saying ""Try thinking of something else."" The film opens with a hefty young couple sitting in a park and the woman is so miserable she breaks into song expressing her longing for a motorcycle that will ""take her away from it all."" After all the woe-is-me routine she adds ""I might come along later"" to her boyfriend despite her earlier extravagant rejection of him.Perhaps the most significant sequence involves a psychiatrist who addresses the camera saying that after 27 years he is worn out trying to make patients happy who are mean because they are so selfish and egocentric. ""You the Living"" suggests that we would do well to discover the joy we find in each other that so often goes along with the pain. -- Kevin Thomas ""You the Living."" MPAA rating Unrated. In Swedish with English subtitles. Running time 1 hour 35 minutes. Laemmles Music Hall Beverly Hills.Seeing another side of ParisIn his bittersweet valentine to the City of Light Cedric Klapisch crisscrosses an array of mostly working-class Parisians whose lives intersect. The setup is a common one for contemporary filmmakers; what lifts ""Paris"" from the subgenre pack is a fine ensemble in particular the emotional chemistry between two of the screens most magnetic actors Juliette Binoche and Romain Duris.Duris dancer faces a life-threatening heart ailment. He remains eager for life even if he must experience it from his balcony or at the corner boulangerie run by a comically chirpy martinet (the superb Karin Viard). Taking care of him his sister (Binoche) comes to a new understanding of the joking remark that opens the film ""The universe is everywhere.""There are fine moments throughout. A history professor (Fabrice Luchini) text-stalks a beautiful student (Melanie Laurent) and in a terrific scene visits a psychotherapist (Maurice Benichou) all but begging for his defenses to be torn down. But as good as the cast is the multiple stories dilute the films effect and authorial string-pulling is often evident.If the idea of interconnectedness feels secondhand whats fresh and affecting is the way Binoches and Duris characters navigate life and death. From the catacombs to the citys heights ""Paris"" turns an unblinking gaze on the beauty of melancholy and the daring leap toward joy.-- Sheri Linden ""Paris."" MPAA rating R for language and some sexual references. Running time 2 hours 4 minutes.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Sep. 17 2009 441PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 318PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Jennifers Body Directed by Karyn Kusama Written by Diablo Cody Starring Amanda Seyfried and Megan Fox Classification 14A Apparently theres nothing like lean and hungry times to awaken the undead. Lately on big screens and small pointy fangs have been chomping down on exposed necks with a tedious vengeance. But just when you think youll never take another sip from a vampire movie along comes the delicious Jennifers Body . So put away your prejudices and drink deep - bloody fun is here to be had. The funs source isnt hard to trace. From the opening dictum (""Hell is a teenage girl) through the many wicked asides (""Im not even a back-door virgin any more"") right down to the witty anticlimax that scrolls over the end credits Diablo Codys script is incisor-sharp. As evidenced in Juno  and again in this outing the woman definitely knows her way up down and around a crisp line of dialogue. Sure like many before her Cody has set her horror show in the horror show that is high school where evil already abounds and back-biting is the order of the day. But unlike most shes found a neat way to raise the stakes to get us from naturally to supernaturally mean from the back up to the neck all without missing a clever beat. We start then with Jennifer and her body who together rule their small-town school. Played by the aptly named Megan Fox the girl is the gorgeous brunette to die for and doesnt she know it. Consequently transforming her into the gorgeous brunette to die from isnt much of a leap. But the manner is ingenious. Strutting her divas stuff at a bar one dark night Jennifer zeroes in on the lead singer of an indie rock group keen to make their breakthrough onto the charts and since Mr. Letterman has yet to come calling theyve put their faith in Mr. Satan. Of course their quest for fame demands a sacrificial virgin (aint it always the way with devilish rituals) and the silly lads think Jen qualifies. Big mistake. Cue the bigger transformation. Not that her classmates notice any difference. Her complexion may have whitened a tad but in the hallways of juvenile power a killer bod is a killer bod and the lineup of eager guy victims remains as long as ever. The flick finds some amusement at the expense of such male folly and then as the death toll mounts high enough to court national media attention the humour acquires a satiric edge complete with Cody-esque sallies like ""The whole country is getting a huge tragedy boner from all this."" Nicely put. Speaking of apt names Ive neglected to mention Needy (Amanda Seyfried) who ever since their childhood days back in the sandbox has been Jennifers tag-along friend - you know the pretty good girl happy to live in the gravitational pull of the pretty bad girl. Seyfried does an admirably subtle job navigating that orbit and hinting at the strength of its pull. She sees Jennifers nasty faults clearly both pre- and post-transformation but theres a need in Needy thats primal - somewhere deep within our light-haired heroine harbours a blond ambition to become a dirty brunette. At that point the sexual psychology takes an expressionistic twist but dont be frightened all you entertainment-seekers out there. This isnt that bleak cerebral German expressionism; instead its the bright pop American variety where the symbolism - Jennifer is the extrinsic proof of Needys intrinsic desire - comes with a payoff many will be delighted to invest in. Which is? Hey nothing less than a lesbian make-out scene shot by director Karyn Kusama in ruby-lipped and tongue-thrusting close-up. At that moment Kusama who previously brought us Girlfight  is fighting no more - she and her once-bellicose belles are clearly at peace. So yes there are symbols and subtext but even these interior layers are shot through with pure fun. In your typical horror picture anything resembling a metaphor wipes clean with a soft tissue. Here at least it takes a J-cloth and a bit of elbow grease and better yet nobodys likely to complain - were too busy whistling while we work.

Jennifers (Megan Fox) insatiable appetites take her on the prowl for a meaty snack in ""Jennifers Body.""

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post This weekends horror offering ""Jennifers Body"" is more of a hoot than a scream. And that suits us just fine. Were wrung out by the charnel- house cruelties of so many horror flicks aimed at teens where the questions are Whats the body count? Can we get the bloody details? This winking pleasure stars Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried as childhood best friends starting to feel the strain of their diverging interests in high school. It has gore and menace. But its short on cruelty and cynicism. Penned by ""Juno"" scribe Diablo Cody the movie is mostly popcorn with some salt added about the place of women in a genre that can be especially brutal to them. The films first words ""Hell is a teenage girl."" Evil arrives in the come-hither form of Devils Kettle denizen Jennifer Check. Fox of ""Transformers"" infamy is the high-school hottie whos outgrown her small town. Seyfried of the blockbuster ""Mamma Mia"" is studious friend Anita. Although nicknamed ""Needy"" the moniker describes her handmaid relationship to Jennifer more than her personality in general. After all she has believably sweet boyfriend Chip (Johnny Simmons) and is able to make friends with others like Goth sensitive Colin (Kyle Gallner). The film opens with Anita incarcerated and unfolds as a recounting. How did a nice girl like her wind up in a place for the criminally unhinged? One thing made clear by ""Jennifers Body"" Cody knows her way around snappy dialogue. This from the trailer in which Anita shares her suspicions with Chip ""Jennifers evil."" ""I know"" he replies. ""No I mean shes actually evil not high-school evil."" Jennifers transformation from mean to possessed takes place after a concert. The scene borrows its misery from the Great White conflagration that took place at a Rhode Island club a few years back. When the roadside tavern combusts the lead singer of Low Shoulder (Adam Brody) and his bandmates leave with Jennifer. What happens to Jennifer who can usually talk her way into and out of trouble is a nicely calibrated mix of the wicked and the wrenching. Director Karyn Kusama finds resonant terror in details the look Anita and Jennifer exchange before Jens fateful ride or a victims last-minute ah-hah. The filmmakers are also skilled with the ridiculous (a collection of woodland creatures makes a cameo) as well as the sublime. The tart inclusion of Holes quasi-riot-grrrl growl ""Violet"" is a bit of genius. Girl-power duo Kusama and Cody owe something to that edgy musical tradition. J.K. Simmons dons a hairpiece and a prosthetic arm as high-school teacher Mr. Wroblewski who along with the student body calls ritualized grief into question. Amy Sedaris appears as Needys mom. Cody also an executive producer on the film doesnt punish teens for having sex. At least not in the clunky way Jell-O-green-with-envy Jason and Mike so often do. Much as she did in ""Juno"" she treats their sexual forays as tender fumbling stuff. Theres no judgment about its appropriateness just acceptance that it will happen. Hey even nerdy students get it on. ""JENNIFERS BODY."" R for sexuality bloody violence language and brief drug use. 1 hour 42 minutes. Directed by Karyn Kusama; written by Diablo Cody; photography by M. David Mullen; starring Megan Fox Amanda Seyfried Johnny Simmons Adam Brody J.K. Simmons Amy Sedaris. Opens today at area theaters.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet When you win an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay as Diablo Cody did with her debut script for Juno in 2007 you have reason to feel confident in your talent. For Cody this turns out to be a dangerous prospect. Her second film script for the excruciating teen horror-comedy Jennifers Body doubles down on the slangy Cody-isms serving as a fresh reminder that the house of Juno wasnt built on a foundation of homeskillets and honest-to-blogs. It was at heart an affecting story about a pregnant teenager sorting through some very difficult decisions and trying to do the right thing; her colorfully sarcastic one-liners worked in part because she deployed them as a kind of defense mechanism. By contrast Jennifers Body is clever for its own sake a showy piece of writing that doesnt have that all-important ballast of sincerity. This time Cody will stop a scene cold for the chance to shoehorn ""move on dot org"" into a sentence. Another major problem Neither Megan Fox nor Amanda Seyfried can handle the wordplay like Ellen Page did. As they play best friends on opposite sides of the popularity divide Fox rips into her line-readings with lusty overconfidence while Seyfried timidly pushes them across as if they were written in a second language. The mayhem begins when the gleefully reckless Fox ropes Seyfried into going to the local roadhouse to see a touring emo band because she has designs on the lead singer. (Adam Brody as the diabolical frontman in question handles the Cody-isms with hilarious aplomb.) After the roadhouse mysteriously bursts into flames the band steals off with Fox in their van; later that evening she returns to Seyfrieds house dazed and covered in blood. Soon enough its revealed that Fox has been transformed into a rapacious demon who feasts on the flesh of the many young men who desire her. What follows is a femme-centered metaphorical horrors-of-high-school film in the mold of Ginger Snaps and Buffy The Vampire Slayer but Codys script fails in the fundamentals like establishing the odd dynamic of Fox and Seyfrieds friendship or defining the particular anxieties of teenage life. The dialogue reaches for the darkly funny abstraction of Heathers but Cody shows off more than she illuminates; even in the middle of the gory climactic sequence the characters are hurling one-liners at each other like rival battle-rappers. They forget that anythings at stake. Share Tweet Filed Under Film More Movie Review Previous Movie Review Paris Next Movie Review Disgrace Dont miss a story--follow The A.V.

This may seem like a reasonable enough statement to anyone who has crossed paths with said creatures but its not an entirely accurate representation of the thesis of Jennifers Body. In this movie hell is actually two girls embroiled in the fiendish complexity of a deep female friendship. The fact that one of them is a boy-eating demon is believe it or not secondary. (See TIMEs pictures ""Rise of the Zombies."") Anita (Amanda Seyfried of Big Love and Mamma Mia) and Jennifer (Megan Fox) residents of a bleak town called Devils Kettle fell in girl love with each other in the sandbox and have remained friends well into high school -- they wear matching lockets engraved with the initials BFF -- despite their differences. Jennifer is a pampered sought-after cheerleader and a raging narcissist (she has a framed photograph of herself on her vanity) while Anita or Needy as shes known is a bespectacled smart girl whose single mom (Amy Sedaris) works the swing shift. The only thing Needy has that Jennifer doesnt is a devoted boyfriend. Chip (Johnny Simmons) is a band geek and soft-eyed sweetheart -- essentially a replica of the Michael Cera character from Juno -- and he barely even notices Jennifers Playboy physique. To him shes just the rival who cuts into his time with Needy. (Read why zombies are the new vampires.) On the day the action starts Needy is persuaded to leave Chip at home and accompany Jennifer to a local dive bar to see a band. The girls stand together holding hands listening to Low Shoulder the preposterously pretentious band fronted by the ""salty"" Nikolai (Adam Brody) and Jennifer is completely smitten. Suddenly the warring elements of Needys relationship with Jennifer play across her face. Shes pleased for her friend -- finally ablaze with passion rather than her usual cynicism -- but simultaneously afraid for her because Jennifers craving for Nikolai is so intense and because she herself knows better than to fall for a poseur like him. Thats her strength. And shes right about him. He is trouble. Within minutes a suspicious electrical fire leaves the bar in flaming ruins and Jennifer disappears with Nikolai and the band only to turn up later covered in blood starving and projectile vomiting what looks like used motor oil. Soon their male classmates start turning up partially consumed (""Lasagna with teeth"" is the description of one victim.) It seems Jennifer has gone from metaphorical man eater to the real thing. Every kill makes her more physically powerful and more beautiful. ""I feel scrumptious"" she tells Needy and undeniably she is. The script is very recognizably Codys laced as Junos was with pop-culture-inspired puns. Some are mildly amusing. ""Move on dot org"" Jennifer tells Needy when she brings up the troubling issue of all the dead bodies. More fall flat as when Jennifer accuses Chip of jealousy ""Youre Jell-O."" Fox handles Codyspeak with the kind of relish you expect from an actress who has spent too much time with Michael Bay. Seyfried a much more nuanced actress mumbles a bit when she gets to a line that is too obviously Junos rather than Needys. There is a lot of intelligent camp here and some sharply observed characterizations (Brody in particular is wickedly funny). Female empowerment would have been the obvious message here with Jennifers bloody appetites stemming from a take-back-the-night scenario gone terribly awry (as in Teeth a smart indie film from 2007) so it was a pleasure to see Cody and Kusama delving instead into the frequently disempowering effect of female friendships. Their depiction of the ways in which women like Needy are willing to compromise themselves to indulge an ultimately less secure friend is spot-on. As the movie approaches its bloody climax were cheering for Needy to take back her own night. But Cody and Kusama have to contend with a tricky story element; you cant just break off your friendship with a demon. In trying to resolve the plot in a crowd-pleasing fashion they loop back unsuccessfully to the idea that BBFs really are forever negating the more interesting groundwork theyd laid. Juno gathered strength as it headed toward its wistful touching conclusion which made it easier to put aside any annoyance with all that honest-to-blogging. Walking out of this film one hopes that someone maybe a very dear girlfriend will convince Cody that phrases like Jesus Fries are demonstrations of a tic not the talent she has in abundance and should be fostering more carefully.

"Jennifers Body Not much life to this | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsOpinionJennifers Body Not much life to thisExpectations are the devils playground.Jennifers Body doesnt have any of the zinging witticisms that were the hallmarks of Diabolo Codys debut effort Juno.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Sept. 18 2009 Jennifers Body (out of 4)Starring Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried. Directed by Karyn Kusama. 102 minutes. At major theatres. 14A. Expectations are the devils playground.Had Diablo Cody not charmed all comers and scored an Oscar for her linguistically limber screenplay for Juno its unlikely her sophomore outing with Jennifers Body would have attracted attention - or disappointment - outside of bored and horny teen boys.Yet Cody is the pen behind this tepid tale of demonic possession and thats the really satanic thing about it. As in what the hell happened?Jennifers Body comes across as Diablo Cody lite something she seems to have dashed off in-between talk show appearances and updating her MySpace page with her latest caustic witticisms.Directed by Karyn Kusama who peaked with her 2000 debut Girlfight its a paint-by-numbers story about a demon-possessed high school girl run amok in smalltown America determined to devour boys in all the wrong ways. Its Ginger Snaps without the snap.Megan Fox is the girl the non-bawdy Jennifer and if youre one of those bored and horny teens hoping to see her in something less than tight clothing youll be swallowing a bitter pill.Shes hotter in her Transformers biker leathers than she is with Beelzebub in her bod.There were so many opportunities to make this the black satire it screams to be but most of them were missed. Cody conjures a promising set-up with a lame rock band called Low Shoulder that seeks success by making a demonic deal with Ol Nick but she fails to deliver the requisite laughs - especially in the scene where these emo idiots led by Adam Brodys oily Nikolai mistake Jennifer for a sacrificial virgin. You might also expect Cody to have some fun with Amanda Seyfrieds character Needy Jennifers erstwhile BFF satirizing the rom-com trope of the gorgeous girl pretending to be homely simply by donning a pair of glasses. Yet its not grist for Codys mill. Seyfried does the best she can with the little shes given.This thing doesnt even work as straight horror. The bumpkins of backwater burgh Devils Kettle (ho ho) ought to be a lot more terrified than they are by the mass incineration of their most drunken residents a tragedy that is followed by Jennifers nocturnal noshing on jocks goths and geeks. Everybody just carries on while the cops resume whittling.The picture devolves into a standard stalk n snack vampire flick. Theres very little of the inventive wordplay or wicked zingers that made Juno such a pleasure - and where such expressions as ""Im crossing you out"" and ""youre Jello"" probably wouldnt have made it past the first table reading.This movie even manages to burn J.K. Simmons who played Junos dad to much amusement. Here hes just punching the clock as a nerdy teacher.Another flick at TIFF where Jennifers Body opened the Midnight Madness program plays the satanic-pact angle to much funnier (and scarier) effect. Its called Suck and its hopefully coming soon to a theatre near you.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

So observes the narrator of Jennifers Body tongue in cheek - not to mention other bodily regions.The high school horror-comedy with a decidedly feminist bite stars Megan Fox as the traffic-stopping title character and Amanda Seyfried as her BFF Needy.It is Needy (short for Anita) who narrates the tale of Satanism ravishment and revenge in girlspeak courtesy of Diablo Cody Juno scribe. (While Codys dialogue is endlessly repeatable every line is delivered as though it has air quotes around it.)As a horror movie Jennifers Body doesnt fully deliver. But as a comic allegory of what its like to be an adolescent girl who comes into sexual and social power that she doesnt know what the heck to do with it is a minor classic.Cody and director Karyn Kusama (Girlfight Aeon Flux) have a lot of fun setting up Fox - seen here in all her glory with that double-dip bod and triple-dip eyelashes - as the voluptuous vixen too cool for school and too hot for you. As this sexually ambidextrous character Fox has a lot of fun too. Her teasing message I know what boys want - and I know what girls want too.Instead of sacrificing Jennifer as the hot chick who deserves to get punished as girls of this sort routinely are in horror films the filmmakers present her as one overwhelmed by hormones and male attention. Jennifer is tired of being the campus lust object. Shes tired of the limited menu of men in Devils Kettle Minn. Shes looking for fresh meat.So with bestie Needy in tow Jennifer goes to the local roadhouse to hear an emo band Low Shoulder led by Nikolai (Adam Brody) and makes him her lust object. Then hell is unleashed and Jennifer becomes a literal man-eater. Yes theres a satanic initiation with a side of chili con carnage.In a clunky but not unlikable way the filmmakers play with ideas about female sexual voracity. At first it is suggested Jennifer is a nymphomaniac. The way Cody structured the film suggests that a not-very-interesting phenomenon has taken place when in fact it is later revealed that something much more interesting has happened. As the movie progresses Jennifer emerges as the Jessica Rabbit of horror - shes not bad shes just drawn that way.As hottie and nottie Fox is appropriately foxy and Seyfried (a genuine beauty) is made to look geeky. These are archetypal characters to be sure but Fox and Seyfried are very good in expressing the intensity of teen-girl friendships.Kusama a good director of actresses doesnt establish her own visual style. Instead she borrows from other directors (Jennifers Body pays tribute to many horror flicks including Carrie The Silence of the Lambs Thelma amp; Louise and Halloween). This makes the film seem derivative when in fact it is an original.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

"Jennifers Body movie review by Roger Moore - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie review Jennifers Body -- 2 out of 5 stars ""Jennifers Body"" is about small town high school student Jennifer (Megan Fox) who is possessed by a hungry demon. She transitions from being ""high school evil"" - gorgeous stuck up and ultra-attitudinal - to the real deal evil/evil. The glittering beauty becomes a pale and sickly creature jonesing for a meaty snack and guys who never stood a chance with the heartless babe take on new luster in the light of Jennifers insatiable appetite. Meanwhile Jennifers lifelong best friend Needy (Amanda Seyfried) long relegated to living in Jennifers shadow must step-up to protect the towns young men including her nerdy boyfriend Chip (Johnny Simmons). Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Megan Fox queen of cut-off jeans lip gloss and hair toss Fandango bait to the fanboys in the Transformers movies makes a mess of herself in a teasing mess of a movie titled Jennifers Body.The erstwhile ""It"" girl riffs through a script by ""It"" screenwriter Diablo Cody ( an Oscar winner for Juno) and typecasts herself as a ""body"" and a literal man-eater. But skinny-dipping scenes and Cody quips cant give this body a heart. Fox is the object of desire in rural Devils Kettle High in Minnesota. Jennifers now-institutionalized BFF ""Needy"" (Amanda Seyfried of Mamma Mia) is the one who tells the tale.""We were our yearbook pictures"" Needy (Anita) narrates ""Nothing more nothing less."" Needy and Jennifer check out a hot indie band at a bar. A horrific fire and a bad decision by Ms. Banging Bod to climb into a van with the band transforms the sultry Jennifer into something that needs human flesh to maintain her glow. As local boys die horrible deaths Needy has to figure out how to convince her beau Chip (Johnny Simmons) that Jennifer is ""Evil. Not just high school evil. EVIL.""Codys wiseacre way with dialogue is a saving grace of this gruesome paint-by-bloody-numbers succubus story. Her teen slang is hip and laugh-out-loud funny.""Whats up Vagisil?""""Wheres it at Monistat?"" Fox is well-cast as a girl who owns her sexiness and knows how to use it. Those arent breasts theyre ""smart bombs. Point em in the right direction"" and.|.|. well you get it.Seyfried makes a sassy counterpoint to Fox. But amid the bloody assaults undeveloped broadly drawn characters (J.K. Simmons as a teacher) and the girl-on-girl action tossed in just for the fanboys this film from the once-promising director of Girlfight wanders into the Dont Care Zone. Clever one-liners dont cover the cruelty here. Jennifer is shallow. The movie about her is too. At least they got the title right. From the opening crotch shot to every bare-midriff moment that follows thats all Jennifers Body is -- Jennifers body nothing more nothing less.  Jennifers BodyTwo of five starsCast Megan Fox Amanda Seyfried Johnny Simmons Adam BrodyDirector Karyn KusamaRunning time 1 hour 42 minutesIndustry rating R for sexuality bloody violence language and brief drug use.

NOBODY can accuse Oscar-winning screenwriter Diablo Cody of trying to top ""Juno"" with the light-on-scares horror spoof ""Jennifers Body"" though fans of the amply displayed Megan Fox will probably not be asking for their money back. The ""Transformers"" hottie undergoes her very own transformation here thanks to satanic possession. ""Shes really evil not high school evil"" helpfully explains a friend in a typically snarky line from Cody who opens with ""Hell is a teenage girl."" PHOTOS MEGAN FOX Megan Fox in Wonderland Magazine The narrator is the aptly named Needy (a glammed-down Amanda Seyfried of ""Mamma Mia"") to whom we are introduced as a violent inmate in a mental institution. In flashbacks we see Needy assigned herself the impossible task of trying to keep her bitchy and gorgeous BFF Jennifer (Fox) from getting into trouble in their small town of Devils Kettle. A trip to a bar for instance ends with the place burning down with many fatalities -- and with Jennifer leaving in a van with a skeevy rock band whose members plan to sacrifice her in a satanic ritual. Unfortunately our heroine has lied about being a virgin. So Jennifer turns up on poor Needys doorstep dripping blood vomiting black goo and acting allegedly scary. Shes her voluptuous self in school the next morning but her new beauty routine requires her to use her seductiveness to literally eat her way through the male student body. Needy eventually figures out that Jennifer is planning a ""buffet"" for herself at the prom with Needys boyfriend (Adam Brody) as the main course. As in ""Juno"" the script is larded with pop culture references as well as many sexual double-entendres and lines like ""Enough with the screaming youre such a cliche."" Indeed theres nothing we havent seen here before even if it is from a more specifically female-centric point of view. The film is sharply photographed and brisky directed by Karyn Kusama (""Girlfight"" and the abysmal ""Aeon Flux"") who encourages Fox and the rest of the cast to chew the scenery and everything else that isnt nailed down. While shes more interested in laughs than suspense or scares gorehounds and admirers of the pinup star will not go home disappointed. Especially when Fox and Seyfried who are not exactly taxed in the acting department share a lengthy lip-lock. J.K. Simmons who played the father in ""Juno"" turns up as a teacher in ""Jennifers Body"" with an Irish accent a prosthetic arm and a wig that makes him resemble the late director Sydney Pollack.

Megan Fox plays Jennifer who gets a makeover from high school vamp to demon bloodsucker. She binges on the guts of high school boys and purges in torrents of black projectile vomit. In similar fashion the film gobbles up horror-movie cliches and sploshes them onto the screen in half-digested disarray. This is the kind of fiasco so jarring that you wish the ushers would wrap you in a shock blanket and hand you a cup of cocoa. Fans of Oscar-winning screenwriter Diablo Cody (and I count myself a big one) can only hope her followup to ""Juno"" will soon be forgotten an awkward asterisk in a proud career. The story is narrated by Jennifers best friend Needy (""Mamma Mias"" Amanda Seyfried) whom we meet as a violent inmate in an asylum. ""I used to be normal"" she declares. ""Well as normal as any girl under the influence of teenage hormones."" Back in Devils Kettle High School she was the nerdy nice girl to Jennifers cheerleader Queen of Mean. Jennifer wants a wingman for her trip to a roadhouse where a cool rock band is playing. The alpha girl wants to sink her talons into lead singer Nicolai (Adam Brody). We soon learn that hes trolling the hinterlands for a virgin sacrifice to Satan (the reason for the offering is one of the movies few well-conceived jokes). Jennifer however is no virgin and through ""demonic transference"" she returns to school with an insatiable thirst for boy blood. Its a serviceable premise but the execution fails on almost every level. The tone wobbles like a tray of Jell-O shots. Director Karyn Kusama (""Aeon Flux"") cant decide if shes making a girl-power gore movie a lampoon of exploitation flicks or a parody of a Diablo Cody film. Teens discuss the Jennifer situation in hyper-articulate Codyspeak (""Shes really evil not high school evil"") but fail to call the authorities to do something about it. A campy scene of Fox shredding jugulars will be followed by a solemn shot of the victims keening parents. If the feel that they were aiming for was grisly hilarity with laughs providing a quick reprieve from nail-biting tension Kusama and Cody utterly miss the target. The effect is not tongue-in-cheek its foot-in-mouth -- all the way up to the knee. JENNIFERS BODY  out of 4 stars Rating R for sexuality bloody violence language and brief drug use. Kusama has zero feel for the dance of anticipation and surprise that marks a good horror movie. She tries to make kill scenes double-scary by pouring on more ketchup. Not that the poorly paced script gave her much to work with. Cody mostly shuffles stock scenes from the fright film template and stirs in her patented Dialogue Helper ""Whats up Vagisil?"" ""Wheres it at Monistat?"" Which brings us to the matter of Fox the most mentally checked-out actress this side of Jessica Alba. That tinny voice. Those vacant eyes. That leer-but-dont-touch strut. Seyfried sells every scene she appears in even a gratuitous out-of-nowhere two-minute lip lock with her co-star. Shes the true star of the show. But its Foxs movie her ascent to leading lady status and she is simply cringeworthy. Ive seen balloon animals with more presence. The decent thing to do with ""Jennifers Body"" would be to cremate it and scatter the ashes.

"Jennifers Body Kind of hot but a little flabby in spots - USATODAY.com Cars  Auto Financing  Event Tickets  Jobs  Real Estate  Online Degrees Shopping SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Life >> Movies Box Office Report Movie Listings Awards Central Shop for Movies/DVDs Jennifers Body Kind of hot but a little flabby in spots Updated  | Review  | Recommend E-mail | Print | Enlarge By Doane Gregory 20th Century Fox Flame on Megan Fox stars as a cannibalistic teenager in Jennifers Body. ABOUT THE MOVIEJennifers Body  (out of four) Stars Megan Fox Amanda Seyfried J.K. Simmons Adam Brody Johnny Simmons Amy SedarisDirector Karyn KusamaDistributor Fox AtomicRating R for sexuality bloody violence language and brief drug useRunning time 1 hour 42 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Jennifers Body is not as hot as you hope it would be. Written by the talented Diablo Cody whose way with words -- particularly teenspeak -- was a revelation in Juno Jennifers Body tries hard to be cool gross and nasty but feels forced and misses the mark. Some of the pieces in this horror/comedy hybrid are marginally inspired such as an alt-indie band (fronted by Adam Brody) who turn to ritualistic murders since the field is so tough to make a name in and the hapless efforts of such school officials as Mr. Wroblewski (J.K. Simmons) to cope with a grisly killing spree that is decimating the student body. But much of the humor and the scares fall short. Jennifers Body generally follows the conventions of a teen horror tale interspersed with some lackluster wannabe edgy humor. It aspires to be sexy by casting Megan Fox as Jennifer a flesh-eating femme fatale. When her best friend a slightly geeky girl named Needy (Amanda Seyfried) tells her sweetly earnest boyfriend (Johnny Simmons) that Jennifer is evil he registers no surprise. She goes on to explain that shes not ""high school evil"" -- conceited manipulative and haughty -- but ""evil evil."" Jennifers drop-dead good looks lead to an epidemic of actual dropping dead around her high school. But the story spins disappointingly out of control lacking the taut structure and clever wit one would expect of Cody after her brilliant debut with Juno. Perhaps it has something to do with hanging a movie on Fox who doesnt demonstrate much of an acting range. (Just ask Michael Bay her director on the Transformers movies.) Fox pouts effectively and wears shiny lip gloss well but Codys acid tongue and snippy quips arent convincing coming from her mouth. Consequently the films mean-spiritedness overshadows its biting hipster wit. The film opens with a scene of scab-picking which might be the perfect metaphor for this movie. While intending to reveal something creepy and hidden from view it lacks a sense of suspense and real twisted-ness. It wears its goriness like an affectation so one is never truly invested in the tale. This seems like the kind of movie that Ellen Pages whip-smart Juno character would dismiss with a surly scoff. The friendship between Jennifer and Needy doesn?t ring true for a second and the film?s efforts to be offbeat and quirky would probably only annoy her. The world of disaffected teens -- whether satirized and made extreme or mined for angst -- is not easy to distill and capture. Jennifers Body sags under the weight of its pretensions.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 17 2009 534 PM Jennifers Body One of the most purely pleasurable movies of the year so far. By Dana Stevens After youve seen Jennifers Body come back and listen to our Spoiler Special discussion on Diablo Codys sumptuous succubus You can also click hereto download the MP3 file or youll find this and dozens of other Spoiler Specials in our iTunes podcast feed here. Megan Fox in Jennifers Body Jennifers body is luscious and powerful sexy and scary maddening at times but impossible to stop watching. So is Jennifers Body (20th Century Fox) the new film directed by Karyn Kusama ( Girlfight) and written by Diablo Cody (who won an Oscar for her catchphrase-laden script for Juno). The literal body in question doesnt really belong to Jennifer; its on loan from Megan Fox the Transformers phenomenon whos never been given a chance before to be anything but a body on-screen (or on the magazine covers that she seems to have single-handedly taken over of late). The combination of the overexposed Cody the wildly overexposed Fox and a much-hyped girl-on-girl kissing scene didnt augur well for this movie. Surely it was going to be a snarky schticky mashup of Twilight and Girls Gone Wild. Instead Kusama and Codys collaboration is a wicked black comedy with unexpected emotional resonance one of the most purely pleasurable movies of the year so far. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. To quote Courtney Love (whose song ""Jennifers Body"" gave the movie its title and whose music plays over the closing credits) Jennifer Check is the girl with the most cake. Outlandishly gorgeous and unapologetically sexual shes the unchallenged alpha female of the local high school in the podunk town of Devils Kettle Minn. Anita ""Needy"" Lesnicki (Amanda Seyfried) has been Jennifers best friend since childhood--as she tells us in the opening voice-over ""sandbox love never dies."" Jennifer pushes the mousy Needy around upstages her torments her--and needs her desperately if only for companionship on ill-advised excursions like a trip to a local roadhouse to see a self-important emo band called Low Shoulder. A freak fire destroys the bar and most of the people in it but Jennifer and Needy escape the inferno. Still in shock Jennifer allows the creepy lead singer (Adam Brody hilariously channeling the Killers Brandon Flowers) to drive her home in his van. Advertisement Thats the last time Needy will ever see her friend alive but it takes her a while to figure out that the bloodstained wreck who shows up at her door later that night is something other than Jennifer. What exactly that something is were never quite sure. Jennifers new incarnation has elements of both vampiredom and zombiehood. In one of those occult-section research montages that no B-movie should be without Needy comes upon a handy guide that identifies her as a ""succubus."" Whatever Jennifer has become shes scary as all hell sprouting fangs to feed on human flesh one minute and reverting back to her Delias-clad cheerleader self the next. To enter into the spirit of Jennifers Body you have to let go of your preconceived notions of Diablo Cody whether for good or ill. If youre looking for the gentle indie spirit of Juno youll be disappointed--this isnt a world in which abortion protesters make their case with twee observations about baby fingernails and getting pregnant at 15 is nothing a Moldy Peaches song cant cure. Life at Devils Kettle High is nasty brutish and short especially for Jennifers male victims (who arent necessarily sexist jerks--one of the movies strengths is its refusal to be read as a straight-up feminist revenge story). If on the other hand Junos preciousness made you gag you shouldnt write off Jennifers Body either. True Codys mania for catchphrases hasnt faded--Needy and Jennifer greet each other with rhymed putdowns along the lines of ""Wheres it at Monistat?""--but shes learning to channel the more egregious lingo into the mouths of characters who might actually talk that way. In Jennifers Body the principal perpetrator of Codyisms is Jennifer herself which makes perfect sense. Proving ones social worth by spouting insider slang is a mark of insecurity and for all her sexual bravado Jennifer is nothing if not insecure. Megan Fox whose previous roles called on little more than her ability to successfully straddle a motorcycle nails this tricky role. She does more than look sensational--she shows us what it feels like to be a sensational-looking young woman and to wield that as your only power. Fox seems to understand the key gambit of Codys script Her character is less a teenage girl turned monster than an exploration of the monster that lurks inside every teenage girl. Amanda Seyfried is no less pitch-perfect as the terrorized best friend Needy (though that character name is an unfortunate symptom of Codys still-unconquered tendency to hammer home her points too hard). In one particularly effective scene Kusama cross-cuts between Jennifers gory cannibalization of a schoolmate and Needy losing her virginity with her boyfriend Chip (Johnny Simmons). What makes this parallel editing work is that Needy and Chips encounter is played completely straight--no clever quips no high drama just a boy and girl having awkward stammering first-time sex. When the camera cuts to Jennifer slurping up her victims organs we get a glimpse of Jennifers sexual self-confidence from Needys point of view as both nightmarish and weirdly enviable. She may be snacking on her dates liver but shes eating her best friend from the inside out. The movies climax in which Needy attempts to save Chip from Jennifers bloodthirsty clutches at the school dance is a bold but not completely successful attempt to blend horror suspense and comedy; its as if Carrie were being re-enacted by the cast of Heathers. But ultimately Jennifers Body functions best as an allegory about female friendship with all its attendant cross-currents of envy competition loyalty and betrayal. By the last scene weve been through all manner of undead mayhem but when Needy rips off Jennifers heart-shaped BFF pendant and hurls it to the ground you know things are really getting serious.

Megan Fox is killer in more ways than one in Jennifers Body but the movie is still lifeless. (20th Century Fox) Joe Neumaier Thursday September 17 2009 1257 PM Title Jennifers Body As their moms get in line for this weeks Jennifer Aniston comedy teen girls will likely head to ""Jennifers Body"" to see some scares and hear some sass.But as screenwriter Diablo Cody might say in her irritatingly pop-cult way this zombie-chick horror-satire is more dead-eyed than Blake Lively.Walking calendar girl Megan Fox stars as the titular ghoulfriend the resident vamp at Devils Kettle High. She and nerdy Anita (Amanda Seyfried cute and perky) have been galpals since their sandbox days though Jennifer chases guys and talks in Tweet-speak while straight-laced Anita cozies up to dorky boyfriend Chip (Johnny Simmons well-cast). Anitas nickname by the way is ""Needy."" As Cody might write OMG get obvious often?While at a concert Jennifer is abducted by the Goth musicians and murdered as a virgin sacrifice so they can attain fame. She is of course the wrong girl for that job and her trollop status curses her to creephood devouring innocents to stay alive.The movie has a few creepy moments thanks to director Karyn Kusamas (""Girlfight"") woods-at-Midnight feel. Fox merely needs to look either vacant or evil which the ""Transformers"" boy-toy does spookily well. And at least the movie is more punky than wannabe-pithy unlike Codys script for the overrated ""Juno.""But words and story are still the lifeblood of a movie and ""Jennifers Body"" is filled like a Twinkie with half-fleshed-out ideas (demonic bands undead superpowers a weirdo waterfall) and becomes fatally distracted from its big ""Carrie""-like conclusion at a high school dance.

BOTTOM LINE Feminist theory cant compensate for jumbled ideas in this occasionally amusing horror-comedy. CAST Megan Fox Amanda Seyfried Johnny Simmons Adam Brody LENGTH 142 Its said that girls are horror-film fans which seems mystifying Could there be a more disempowering genre for women? ""Jennifers Body"" aims to turn those tables This time its the boys who meet untimely deaths at the hands and jaws of a bloodthirsty female. That female is Megan Fox who threw some memorable curves into the angular ""Transformers"" films. Shes the perfect choice to play Jennifer Check a come-hither high schooler smoldering in a damp backwater called Devils Kettle. Her nerdy best friend is Anita ""Needy"" Lesnicki played by Amanda Seyfried (""Mamma Mia"") wearing oversize glasses and a mop of unvolumized hair. The story kicks into gear when Jennifer hops into a van with several sinister indie-rockers (led by an entertaining Adam Brody ""The O.C.""). What they do to her would horrify even Motley Crue but Jennifer reappears the next day in strangely good spirits. Whats more as local boys begin turning up half-eaten Jennifer only grows prettier. Connecting the dots Needy suspects her own boyfriend (a baby-faced Johnny Simmons) will be next. advertisement | advertise on newsday Screenwriter Diablo Cody (""Juno"") and director Karyn Kusama (""Girlfight"") have nth-wave feminism on their minds but their abundant ideas never jell. Is Jennifer a sexual avenger or just a bimbo? Where did the smart confident Needy get her nickname? And do the filmmakers really think viewers will still be shocked by a girl-on-girl kiss? Last year a low-budget horror flick called ""Teeth"" about a virginal girl who had incisors where she shouldnt covered this territory with more creativity complexity and humor. ""Jennifers Body"" for all its promise could use some of that bite.

Jennifers Body Fair Director Karyn Kusama. Cast Megan Fox Amanda Seyfried Johnny Simmons. Rating R for sexuality violence language and drug use. Related Qamp;A Diablo Cody Women get their bloody revenge Big stars little talent Toronto film fest Sexually assured confident perfectly willing and able to disarm all those around her with her frankness Jennifer would seem the perfect role for Fox. Fox is of course the eye candy in the ""Transformers"" movies and something of a sensation among the Internet-ogling and lad-mag set. But Diablo Cody wrote the ""Jennifer"" script a few years ago before Fox was well known. Chalk it up to luck. Yet while Foxs performance as a high-school girl possessed by a demon would seem key to the fortunes of the film Amanda Seyfried as her unlikely best friend Needy makes it more interesting than it would be. Jennifer and Needy have been best friends since childhood (""sandbox love never dies""). Jennifer is the hot cheerleader who uses her precocious sexuality to get what she wants. Needy is the bookish nice girl (the ugly glasses are the clue) with a steady boyfriend Chip (Johnny Simmons). Eventually at least. The film begins with a framing device in which Needy is housed in a facility for the criminally insane; shes not exactly the model patient. She recalls just a few months ago when things were normal in the town of Devils Kettle (subtlety is not always one of Codys strong suits). That changes when a band from the city led by singer Nikolai (Adam Brody) comes to town to play. But a fire burns down the venue killing several people and Nikolai and his bandmates drive off with Jennifer. Jennifer shows up later that night at Needys house (parents are conveniently absent when they need to be) covered in blood and vomiting some sort of gore that looks like tar and needles. This cant be good. No dummy Needy she picks up on this. But the next day Jennifer is radiant and happy even as the rest of the school and town are depressed over the fire. Soon boys start turning up dead torn apart. Movies like this dont have much mystery; you know whats going on practically from the start. They rely more on execution. Fox is able to keep up with Codys signature overly self-aware hip-teen slang (youre not jealous youre Jell-O lime-green Jell-O) but Jennifer isnt exactly a stretch for her. Brody has fun with the singer desperate to make it big. If human sacrifice is what it takes well doesnt everyone have to sacrifice to succeed? (Bonus points for suggesting that Maroon 5 is evil.) The great J.K. Simmons is largely wasted as a clueless teacher with a hook for a hand. But its Seyfried who is able to make the shift from virginal good girl to vengeance-seeking hellion both plausible (if plausibility exists in a movie like this) and intriguing. Good thing because neither Cody nor director Karyn Kusama has come up with anything original here (beyond the admittedly cool idea of what happens when you mean to sacrifice a virgin but your victim isnt one).

This is the sophomore production from Juno screenwriter Diablo Cody similarly told through ultra-stylized slangy teen dialogue which is cool in theory in the way it respects the verbal resourcefulness of idle flyover kids but is excruciating to listen to in actual fact. Megan Foxs lithe Jennifer is BFF to goldfish-faced bespectacled Amanda Seyfrieds ""Needy""--the nickname underlines the essentially condescending dynamic in their high school relationship which also digresses into the best close-up girl-girl liplock since Cruel Intentions. Jenny is transformed from a flaunting tease into a literal man-eater a boy-gobbling succubus after going off one night in some out-of-town rockers van (the movie can read as a cautionary tale on the dangers of trolling for hot band dudes instead of sticking with your schlubby boyfriend) setting up a Good Girl vs. Bad Girl knock-down-drag-out. The suburban interior decor is about a generation off but the satire is roughly contemporary with routine ""risky"" digs at 9/11 kitsch (and generally the American ""Tragedy boner"") and a re-enactment of the Great White club fire. Lines like ""Sandbox love never dies"" could be lyrics to the Warped Tour riffs to which Fox slo-mo sashays at the camera.

"Jennifers Body | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; jennifer-s-body ) Jennifers Body (United States 2009) September 14 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Jennifers Body mixes matches and crosses three popular genres horror comedy and teen angst. Unfortunately it fails at all of them - and ""fails"" might be too kind a term. This movie is a spectacular disaster the kind of thing a cat might bury in a litter box and still keep building the covering because the stench cant be smothered. There are so many things wrong with this motion picture that it might be easier to pinpoint the few elements that are right. The film is the product of the ""girl power"" team of director Karyn Kusama (Girlfight) and writer Diablo Cody (Juno). Neither has previously dabbled in horror and based on the evidence at hand in Jennifers Body neither should be allowed near it again. Kusama comes across as a filmmaker who is playing at making an exploitation flick without having a good understanding of what the elements are and how they mesh. The tone is off throughout like a piece of music played in the wrong key. The notes are there but the sound is dissonant. Drinking massive amounts of coffee before seeing Jennifers Body might make it more bearable since frequent trips to the bathroom will break up the monotony. Amanda Seyfried is Needy a typical high school nerd girl whose best friend is the hotter-than-hot Jennifer (Megan Fox). The two are an unlikely pair and they both know it. When they go out together Jennifer wants Needy to look good but not too good. Upstaging is not welcome. Needy has a boyfriend whos on her ""level"" - the sweet eager Chip who could have been played by Michael Cera if he hadnt been doing something else (instead the job went to Johnny Simmons). One night Jennifer drags Needy to a bar to watch the group Low Shoulder. The lead singer (Adam Brody) gives Needy the creeps but Jennifer is into him. And when she disappears in a van with the guys of Low Shoulder after their gig is abruptly ended by a fire Needy fears the worst. But Jennifers experiences with Low Shoulder result not in her death but her transformation into a demon that eats men (literally) as a way of maintaining her beauty and vitality. For Diablo Cody this represents an opportunity to prove that Juno was not a fluke. But the comfortable wit of Codys Oscar-winning screenplay is largely absent here although the rhythms of the dialogue indicate that she may be trying too hard. An approach that worked wonderfully in the more naturalistic environment of a low-key teen comedy fails utterly here. This is a clear case of a screenwriter attempting both to broaden her range and copy what made her successful and not succeeding in either aim. The films central attraction (and some might argue its only attraction) is Megan Fox. Before this we have had little indication whether Fox is just another well-toned body or whether she has some acting chops to go with the grade-A abs. Michael Bay used her as eye candy so its not fair to judge her based on two ultra-long toy commercials. Sadly Jennifers Body indicates that Bay optimized Foxs exposure without unduly highlighting her flaws. Her acting is plastic and one-dimensional. Pairing her with Amanda Seyfried was probably not a good choice because Seyfried can act and her ability makes Foxs deficiencies more glaring. Maybe the filmmakers should have chosen Paris Hilton instead of Seyfried. Kusama and Cody are apparently trying to make some kind of murky statement about strong powerful women in horror movies although their take is neither original nor interesting. Yes the hero and villain are both women and the victims are male but thats less unusual in the horror genre than one might suppose. Theres also a resolute determination not to show any nudity. Theres plenty of PG-13 teasing including a long lesbian kiss (with tongue) but the movies R-rating (earned because of copious gore and much profanity) makes all the covering-up seem strangely prudish especially since this fits into the exploitation genre. Coyness does not belong in a movie like this. I have my problems with Hostel but at least Eli Roth understood that B-grade horror comedies go all-out when it comes to gratuitous elements gore violence sex and nudity. (I assume the decision to avoid Tamp;A is Kusamas since there are several scenes in the film where flesh could easily have been shown and one would assume based on her past that Cody has no problem with nudity.) There are also editing problems. One scene attempts to create parallelism by intercutting two sex scenes but the back-and-forth shifts happen at the wrong times breaking the flow and creating a scene that feels awkward. Jennifers Body also struggles to figure out whether it wants to be campy or a little less flamboyant but it never finds the right balance. Its never truly scary or funny. At the beginning it feels amateurish as if a bunch of people who dont have a clue about horror decided to make a movie. By the end its almost insulting. The movie is a trial to sit through reminding us that just because something looks delicious doesnt mean the taste wont be rancid. If youre in search for a way to ogle Megan Foxs body there are a lot better ways to do it than subjecting yourself to this.

While not exactly lifeless ""Jennifers Body"" sure could be fresher. Even with Megan Fox ideally cast as a sharp-fanged succubus with a lusty appetite for young male (and sometimes female) flesh this high school horror romp tackles its bad-girl-gone-really-bad premise with eye-rolling obviousness and fatally a near-total absence of real scares. Fox Atomic item will stir interest as a post-""Juno"" outing for scribe Diablo Cody whose whippersnapper sensibility can be heard in the occasional snatches of self-consciously clever dialogue. But even auds primed to see guts and other exposed body parts will be disappointed by a ""Body"" less bawdy than advertised. At the very least Fox (the actress not the studio) best known for her pinup-worthy turns in the ""Transformers"" movies must be grateful for a project that requires her to do more than interact suggestively with the hood of a Camaro. Not that the role of a snotty teenage vamp reps a huge stretch Jennifer (Fox) teases and seduces every guy within flirting distance her sexual over-confidence masking a desperate desire to escape her tiny hometown the unpromisingly named Devils Kettle. Nervously overseeing Jennifers behavior is her nicer smarter best friend Needy (Amanda Seyfried wearing glasses so as to look plain by comparison). ""Sandbox love never dies"" Needy muses early on adding some latent Sapphic undertones to the pics unholy hormonal stew even though she has a cute attentive b.f. (Johnny Simmons). But after the girls narrowly escape a freak fire that destroys a local tavern one night Needy can only watch helplessly as Jennifer possibly high on smoke fumes gets into a van with a band of wannabe rockers whose intentions seem rather less than pure. Hours later Jennifer turns up at Needys house dripping blood vomiting black tar and behaving in a generally unpleasant manner. But before you can say ""Drag Me to Hell"" shes back at school the next day looking as healthy and voluptuous as ever -- though she has a weirdly callous attitude toward the towns rapidly mounting death toll as one male classmate after another is found brutally dismembered. Even this summary suggests more of a mystery than the pic actually has stashed beneath its creaky floorboards. In her latest femme-driven actioner (albeit one quite different from either her promising indie ""Girlfight"" or her sci-fi campfest ""Aeon Flux"") helmer Karyn Kusama shows little interest in mounting suspense instead resorting to a tired arsenal of shock cuts jolting sound design and levitation effects. Auds have probably endured Ouija board sessions scarier than the flashback revealing the precise nature of Jennifers demonic condition. In ""Juno"" Cody succeeded in bringing her cheeky high spirits to bear on the usually sober topic of teen pregnancy; surprising then that shes unable to work the same magic with a much more outlandish story. Cody also exec produced ""Jennifers Body"" and it certainly bears her arch comic signature from its satirical jabs at indie-rock poseurs (who per the script are basically Satans henchmen) to the way her characters tend to sound more like hyperarticulate pop-culture savants than recognizable adolescents. Fox gets plenty of juicy double-entendre-laden dialogue with which to flaunt her carnal knowledge though sorry to disappoint the R rating is more due to the pics gore quotient than its coy almost-nudity. Seyfrieds appealing grounded presence here may bring to mind her ditzy turn in ""Mean Girls"" and indeed the current films not-very-well-buried subtext is that its a mean-girl tale taken to supernatural yet entirely logical extremes; the bitch trying to steal your boyfriend might just as well be evil enough to steal your soul. Fox sinks her teeth into the role with admirably bloodthirsty abandon yet as ""Jennifers Body"" approaches its overwrought climax its hard not to think that as a match for her talents the Camaro may have been the superior vehicle. ""Juno"" alums include producers Mason Novick and Daniel Dubiecki; director Jason Reitman who gets a producing credit here; and thesps Valerie Tian and J.K. Simmons sporting an Irish accent and making the most of his brief scenes as a one-handed schoolteacher.
