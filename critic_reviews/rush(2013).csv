Dave McGinn The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 27 2013 1201AM EDT Last updated Friday Sep. 27 2013 900AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Ron Howard Written by Peter Morgan Starring Chris Hemsworth Daniel Bruhl Olivia Wilde Classification 14A Year 2013 Country USA Language English James Hunt and Niki Lauda are a filmmakers dream.In the mid-1970s they shared an epic rivalry in a sport - Formula One - with plenty of action and death-defying drama. Off the track the two men couldnt have been more different offering director Ron Howard and screenwriter Peter Morgan (The Queen Frost/Nixon) the chance to explore something much more interesting than the typical sports movie where a single hero is on a path to inevitable glory. Multimedia Rush The official trailer Video Video Stars Ron Howard on the TIFF red carpet for Rush The problem with car-racing movies though is that they are car-racing movies. Has any director found a way to spare audiences the eventual tedium of watching automobiles go around and around a track and instead capture the thrill of the sport?Howard a dependable craftsman not known for action sequences does his best by putting cameras just about everywhere you could imagine down at a drivers feet inside the cockpit behind spinning wheels up above trees that hide speeding cars and by the side of the track as cars whip by.While Howard is busy with these multiple perspectives Morgans screenplay is singularly focused on the two mens contrasting personalities which become not just differences of character or temperament but opposing life philosophies. Hunt is the brash reckless Englishman who beds any woman he wants and swigs champagne before a race whereas Austrian Lauda is the calculating impersonal technician.To its credit the film portrays both men as equally unlikeable. Chris Hemsworth (Thor) plays Hunt with such cocksureness that he nearly swaggers over the line into parody. Daniel Bruhl (Inglourious Basterds) seems to revel in playing up Laudas more oft-putting character traits. Why his wife loves him is anyones guess although none of the secondary characters including Olivia Wilde as Hunts wife are much more than thinly drawn sideshows to the main event of Hunt and Laudas battles.Howard has to compress six years of those battles into a mere 123 minutes which means he is briefly forced to recount race results at whiplash speed Lauda wins this one Hunt wins that one. Points totals are flashed on screen. It also means the film opens and closes with bits of completely superfluous voice-over dialogue explaining the rivalry and the two mens hard-won respect for each other.The movie finds its emotional centre when Lauda has a crash during a race in 1976 that leaves him badly burned. The scenes of his recovery including him getting his lungs vacuumed are painful to watch. When he gets back in the car its emotional though hardly as rousing as Howard and Morgan want it to be.The final showdown to decide who will emerge as champion of the world shot in a gritty palette by cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle manages a surprise twist - even if who winds up on the podium is predictable.The movie could have ended there but Howard and Morgan cant resist a denouement where the rivals have a chance encounter in an airplane hangar and bludgeon the audience with a discussion of their different philosophies of life just in case you havent been watching. Lauda tells Hunt that hard work and dedication make a champion while Hunt says that if you dont enjoy life whats the point of winning races.Unlike so many other conventional sports movies Howard chooses not to take sides. Its a wise decision in an entertaining movie with two solid performances that only occasionally stalls because of its sometimes heavy-handed treatment of Hunt and Laudas differences.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) left and rival Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) dominate the Formula One circuit in the 1970s in ""Rush."" (Jaap Buitendijk) By Ann Hornaday September 26 2013 Follow AnnHornaday The last time director Ron Howard and screenwriter Peter Morgan worked together it was on ""Frost/Nixon"" a crafty and illuminating cat-and-mouse psychological thriller that pitted interviewer David Frost against still-roaring lion in winter Richard Nixon. With ""Rush"" the filmmakers are in harness again and again their fascination lies with two strong-willed men of diametrically opposed temperaments. Ostensibly about the rivalry between Formula One race car drivers James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) which reached its zenith in the explosively dramatic 1976 season ""Rush"" is also an old-fashioned morality tale an iteration of the Ant and the Grasshopper with fast cars spectacular smash-ups fierce competition and the kind of cutthroat grudgingly respectful one-upsmanship of which so many classic male-bonding myths are made. Beginning in 1976 when Hunt and Lauda played their own cat-and-mouse game through a series of Grand Prix races ""Rush"" flashes back six years earlier when Hunt -- a handsome blond playboy -- first meets Lauda a serious-minded Austrian with an unfortunate overbite and zero sense of humor. Both sons of prosperous bourgeois families their similarities end there with Hunt largely driving on instinct and adrenaline and Lauda taking a far more technical analytical approach. Portrayed as a hot-headed undisciplined risk-taker on track and a legendary swordsman in bed Hunt was like a shaggy 007 of the car-racing world; at one point someone actually introduces him as ""Hunt James Hunt."" While Hunt lives it up dining on oysters and Champagne at races and capitalizing on the ""aphrodisiacal effects of being close to death"" as he puts it at one point Lauda keeps his head down his humanity finally peeking through when he takes his future wife (and two awe-struck fans) on a breakneck joyride through the Italian countryside. Morgans script can be faulted for telling rather than showing too often as the men deliver a few too many pat speeches in which they spell out What Our Rivalry Means. But Howard directs ""Rush"" with speed and jangly jarring verve bringing the races themselves to white-knuckled life and allowing the mens stories to play out with only slightly predictable reversals upsets and inevitably those hard lessons learned. The most harrowing of those sequences happens during the German Grand Prix in 1976 when Lauda is horribly burned at which point the film slows down to show his excruciating recovery in literally painstaking detail. The episode not only tempers Laudas resolve but leaves him even less handsome than Britains perennial Golden Boy who even when hes binging on alcohol and pot seems destined for a life free of ordinary consequences. As much escapist fun as ""Rush"" is as an adrenaline-juiced car-race movie its most interesting as a rare depiction of male vanity how physical attractiveness informs self-worth and potency and the role beauty -- so often the sole purview of women on screen -- plays in mens relationships and personal insecurities. Its not surprising that Lauda earns the audiences allegiance as the plain-looking hard-working underdog of the pair; the twist is how much sympathy Hunt earns as the pretty one who keeps his anxieties hidden beneath glib bonhomie and quiet bouts of pre-race nausea. That viewers care at all about men who are joyless bossy and arrogant on one hand and vain shallow and arrogant on the other can be directly attributed to Bruhl and Hemsworth each of whom imbues his character with enough personal charm to keep the audience invested as their cars keep going round and round. Howard cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle and editor Daniel P. Hanley deserve credit as well for creating a crisp well-told account that succeeds as a workaday biopic glamorous period piece and portrayal of sports culture that seems quaintly scruffy seen from an era taken over by steroids TV-ready narratives and endorsement deals. Considering the subject matter ""Rush"" delivers the expected visceral jolts; whats surprising is how endearing it is even when its two protagonists are behaving like little more than boys with very fast toys.

"The Fast and the Furious << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous Deliberating the Niners  Next Quite a Rush Courtesy of Fox Searchlight Facebook Twitter Print Movies The Fast and the Furious Paula Patton runs for love Ali fights for justice and Ron Howard drives really hard by Wesley Morris on September 27 2013 When movies stars really want love they run for it. They run to train stations and airports. They run across cities across time across Fenway Park. Based on the amount of running done in Baggage Claim no one in the history of movies has ever wanted love more than Paula Patton. A hilarious amount of this movie devotes itself to her in motion. When she runs its your pulse that goes up. ""Run"" isnt exactly what Patton does either. She gallops. The best thing about her previous romantic comedy Jumping the Broom was seeing her bounding through a house and across lawns. The movies could use more of her coltishness. Pattons Hollywood sisters (and grandsisters) -- the best and most popular of them anyway -- have just been too sophisticated too self-actualized too free too smart to do that sprinting Katharine Hepburn Audrey Hepburn Doris Day Julia Roberts Meg Ryan even Katherine Heigl. They hem. They haw. Then they succumb. They have standards. Some of them try running the other way first. Not Paula Patton. Paula Patton will run you down for love. In Baggage Claim she gets out of a car at the airport runs toward the check-in then runs back to the car because she forgot something. The movie knows its a good gag. She does it three times. And thats the other thing about Paula Patton. She might run you over but itd be an accident. Shed turn right around and say something like ""Oh my god. Im so sorry. I have a man to catch. Did I say that? -- I meant plane. God Im such a dork."" That wouldnt be untrue. She is a dork. Baggage Claim has Patton playing a flight attendant named Montana Moore.1 And the reason shes always on the run is occupational yes but personal too. Her baby sister (Lauren London) is getting married and her fabulous man-eating mother (Jenifer Lewis) wont stand for Montana showing up alone at the wedding. She has 30 days to find a solution. So Montanas bickering best friends/coworkers -- Jill Scott (buxom; breathy; horny) and Adam Brody (slender; mannerly; willing to leave the queeniness to Scott) -- devise an only-in-the-movies travel network courtesy of pals at curbside check-in ticketing and security that alerts her whenever one of her exes is about to fly. The thinking here is that it has been a while; maybe one guys eligibility (or suitability) has changed. Theres a young record producer (Trey Songz) and a Congress-bound chauvinist (Taye Diggs) as well as her sturdy Baltimore hallmate (Derek Luke) a strapping businessman (Boris Kodjoe) and Djimon Hounsou as a jet-setting hotel magnate with a fatless face and viscous accent. (Almost none of these men flies coach.) The movie which David Talbert wrote and directed comes up with one reason after another for Montana to turn them down. Some of them are legitimate. The record producer for instance is a fool. Her hallmate taxis her around in his truck opens her mail but has a girlfriend (Christina Milian). One of these gentlemen will reveal himself to be Mr. Moore. The rest are less -- but never less than -- entertaining especially Diggs and his invention of bitchy machismo. This is a silly predictable movie but it never runs out of small happy surprises. Its a romantic comedy fried in chick-flick batter. Montanas husband-hunting seems initially like the sort of depressing fantasy you find in a Heigl movie. (Montana has toiled as a bridesmaid only a third as many times as Heigl in 27 Dresses.) But Talbert is going for something more classical. Hes made a kind of 1930s romantic comedy stuffed full of charismatic characters and screwball nonsense and good throwaway lines. It also has the robust sense of indecency that gave some 30s comedies their kick and remains cute and cutting without going crass. Scotts character Gail calls after Montana hooks up with the businessman and asks Montana whether shes still having sex. ""I wouldnt answer the phone"" Montana says. ""I would"" says Gail with a purr. The movie takes the ludicrousness of this scenario and wrings glamour and lavishness from it. Thats not just a matter of the five-star hotels apartments and yachts. Its also having an actress as flamboyantly regal as Lewis sashaying around bellowing judgments. Shes like Thelma Ritter Celeste Holm and Pearl Bailey all being done by one drag queen. Talbert has thrown in some topical farce too. For the business-meeting scene in a fancy restaurant that these movies have been doing for eight decades Diggss politician takes Montana to dinner with a donor (Ned Beatty). Just as the two men are about to get into an argument about the authenticity of Tiger Woodss blackness Montana interrupts this way ""What I think makes Tiger Woods black is that he drives an Escalade and that his daddys name is Earl."" You have to hear for yourself Pattons aw-shucks delivery but a line like that is a conversion moment for a skeptical audience. It tells you somebodys home. The movie didnt have to go there but it does over and over. Scenes like that seem to borrow from the loose louche banter of an Ernst Lubitsch movie. Its all ""Look ma no hands"" stuff. Talberts other movie was a gassy hostage comedy called First Sunday with Ice Cube and Tracy Morgan holding up the churchiest of churches. It didnt work but it had something that passed for wit. This new film has actual wit. Most crucially though it has Patton. Patton is a severely youthful 37-year-old light-skinned black woman. Her neck is thick. Her shoulders are wide. Shes tall. If acting didnt work out thered always be volleyball. (Diggs is almost half Pattons size.) Shes had memorable parts in Precious (she was the funky lesbian writing teacher Miss Blu Rain) and the last Mission Impossible movie and is better known for her beauty and her husband Robin Thicke. But Patton is best at contagious bliss. She might be the best at it. When she smiles you smile. You want her to have what she wants even when how she wants it is stupid. The running is a big deal with her. But that just lands her in a specific movie club. Whats most special about Patton is her buoyancy. As a star shes impervious to gravity. Her voice has some rasp and girlishness and wonder. She was raised in Los Angeles and its California you hear when she speaks. Its optimism and hope. The other romantic comedy stars have struggled in some way. Is their idealism compatible with their feminism? Patton is conflict-free an actor who floats and carries you up with her. Judy Holliday Mary Tyler Moore and Goldie Hawn could do that. Amy Adams did it in Enchanted. Emma Stone does it on award shows. Taraji P. Henson did it in Think Like a Man. Adams made just one obvious romantic comedy 2010s Leap Year and it was awful partly because you could feel her hating herself for making it. She didnt want to be that kind of star a let-go balloon. She needed emotional anchors. Patton doesnt seem to care about any of that. (Baggage Claim is actually an ironic title for a woman who travels this light.) Its fair to see her crinkling up her nose or grinning ear to ear to see her so radiantly unself-conscious and mistake her delight for cluelessness. She just doesnt need to show you how smart she is which is why that Tiger Woods line lands so perfectly. Shes a dingbat with a snipers aim. Its as if she has passed all of the self-doubt without even having to go through it. The romantic comedy needs that kind of assurance right now. It needs a star who can be important for movies without seeming to have an ounce of importance in her. Maybe its a note of progress that the great sports controversies are now largely self-inflicted. The egotism they expose fails to alter the larger culture. Alex Rodriguez and Lance Armstrong for instance debase the thrill of principled self-aggrandizement. Their version of righteousness is a joke. The stakes are big but narrow. The goal isnt to protect a legacy per se -- its to uphold a commercial brand. The Trials of Muhammad Ali a magnificently concise documentary by Bill Siegel recalls a moment in which one mans beliefs enthralled the planet. Much of Alis stardom owed to his presentation and packaging. He was a showman but a rare ideological one. The film reminds you that his showmanship had an angle. Largely it looks back on the seismic impact of Cassius Clay changing his name to Muhammad Ali and joining the Nation of Islam. He did so not long after his upset of Sonny Liston for the world heavyweight title in 1964 shocked the country. He then upset the establishment by renouncing what he called his ""slave name."" Alis natural charisma had hooked up with a charismatic political outfit whose pro-black anti-white anti-integration platform amplified his bravado. He renounced his draft status refusing to join the Army and go to Vietnam on both religious and historical grounds. (The Vietnamese didnt lynch his people. That was America.) Ali was convicted of draft evasion stripped of his title and banned from boxing while awaiting the outcome of a Supreme Court appeal. The film explores the legal ingenuity that kept him out of prison and the cultural fruit born of his almost four-year absence from boxing. Alis conscientious-objector status transformed him from an athlete to a spokesman against injustice. He was the fighter who wouldnt go to war. The film deploys the usual nonfiction arsenal of news footage archival photographs and interviews to bring home the strange electricity of these seven or so years. Siegel gets the right footage photos and people (including the journalist and current ESPN ombudsman Robert Lipsyte Alis second wife Khalilah Camacho-Ali and Louis Farrakhan whos as mischievous as ever). Siegel doesnt slather the images in agenda or overproduction. This isnt an argument so much as an evocation The wire from that era is still live. As race-conscious as 2013 America might seem its got nothing on the 1960s and 1970s. Ali was the most crucial transformational figure from that era. For one thing he was the major race figure who survived it. For another whether he was confronting or being confronted he had a camera-ready stardom. Even when he was wrong ideologically (and as Elijah Muhammads bigoted mouthpiece he often was) Ali was irresistible. He could make the wrongness seem sensible. This was a man who came to equate most relationships with whites as a form of slavery. Photos of him seated at a conference table surrounded by some of the 11 white Kentuckians who managed his money provide a little psychological clarity. Technically they worked for him but still. By 1966 both sides had parted ways. The assassinations of the 1960s left Ali oddly and increasingly alone at the vanguard of civil rights iconography. He became the dapper eloquent embodiment of both violence and nonviolence militancy and charm. He presented sports as theater politics as theater theater as theater (theres a clip of his bearded Afro-ed performance in Buck White a musical that opened on Broadway at the end of 1969). This movie makes you feel his radicalism all over again. Whenever athletes declare themselves the greatest it feels somehow like a mockery of the complexity of Alis greatness. His progenys self-obsession differs from Alis self-regard. Its punier. This isnt to say Ali didnt have a brand to promote and protect. He did. But his brand was humanity. The Ali documentary is rolling out incrementally. If you happen not to live in one of the handful of U.S. cities showing it and want a movie about risk and consequence in sports Ron Howards Rush will more than do. It makes comic drama of the season-long 1976 contest between Formula 1 drivers Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) and James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) to end that year atop the sport. Howard and his crew give the races an impressionistic zing. Getting into a car after this movie is like having sex after seeing John Holmes work. Youll feel like an amateur. The script is another Peter Morgan special. Like say The Queen and Frost/Nixon its a speculative duet built around a moment of newsworthiness. That moment in Rush involves a crash at the German Grand Prix that left Lauda with severe burns on his face and in his lungs. The crash occurs beyond the movies halfway point raising the film somewhere higher than the enjoyable odd-couple competitive-strategy piece it had previously been. It becomes a compelling enactment of athletic philosophy that better than most sports movies individuates the thrill that makes athletes compete. Both Lauda and Hunt are affluent outcasts. They want to prove their families wrong. Otherwise theyre opposites. Lauda is a funny-looking Austrian pedant. Bruhl a Spanish-born German plays the part sugar-free. Hes like a Rafa Nadal post-match press conference. Lauda knows mechanics understands physics and has a complete awareness of the logistics required to win. He loves that hes smarter than everyone else. Hunt is a slutty rock star from England. He parties prefers his shirts open to his navel and likes to go fast. That entertainingly is that. Hunts arrogance provides Hemsworths smoldering dullness with a suitable home. The crash gives the relationship depth and Laudas recovery stinging purpose. From his hospital bed he can see Hunts teeth gleaming from the winners podium. (Howard doesnt even need to include the ""ting"" sound effect.) The film spells out whats different about these two. The accident happens after Lauda tries to cancel the race and Hunt basically calls him a pussy. Lauda wants desperately to win. He just isnt willing to die for it. Hes risk-averse. For Hunt its safety last. Any risk-awareness dampens the fun. Morgans script wonders aloud about professionalism versus bravado; pragmatism versus showmanship. It convincingly asks what winning entitles a champion to. To that end Rush might be an inapt title. They couldve just called the movie More. Crazily that name is almost the same as the transsexual daytime star played by Cathy Moriarty in the severely underrated Soapdish.

By Anthony Lane James Hunt and Niki Lauda compete on the track in Ron Howards new movie.   Credit Illustration by Chris B. Murray The new Ron Howard film ""Rush"" is about the rivalry between two young drivers who fought for the Formula 1 world championship in the nineteen-seventies. In one corner we have the crowing rooster a lusty blond Brit by the name of James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) who competed for the good times the glory and the fun. In the opposing corner lurks Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) born into Austrian wealth whose demeanor was that of a highly organized rodent and who approached every race as if it could be solved by quadratic equations. Never was battle joined with more fury than in 1976 when the outcome was decided in the final minutes of the final race and settled by a single point. In the words of Tom Rubython whose timidly titled book ""In the Name of Glory 1976 the Greatest Ever Sporting Duel"" covers the same ground as the film ""No Hollywood screenwriter could have scripted such an ending or described the human drama of such a dramatic season."" That sound you hear is the nibbling of an authors fingernails as he waits for a producer to call. In short ""Rush"" sets off at the front of the starting grid though it soon makes a hash of that advantage. We get a lurch of flashbacks and voice-overs swerving from 1976 to 1970 as if cutting and pasting were the only way to proceed. Is it now completely beyond the pale to tell a story in chronological order? Is the example of ""Citizen Kane"" a helpful one in all circumstances? It would have been simpler in the case of ""Rush"" to begin in the early seventies and accelerate from there. After all it was a merry scene perched on the edge of a joke. We see Hunt driving Formula 3 cars--less prestigious than their Formula 1 kindred but equally frail--for Alexander Hesketh (Christian McKay) a rubicund English lord who hands his protege a glass of champagne before the race saying ""Have a gargle with this."" It is inconceivable that such roistering amateurs--as they seemed to the outside world--should have sidled into the big time but somehow it came to pass and when the Hesketh funds ran dry Hunt switched to the McLaren team. A smart move because it was sponsored by Marlboro and Hunt was a champion smoker; he actually preferred Rothmans but would carefully cram them into a Marlboro pack just to keep the customer satisfied. The film is shy of such details never mentioning that he was also drawn to cocaine. Hemsworth catches the swagger of the man but Hunt was more big-headed both physically and emotionally than ""Rush"" allows and his gluttonous record as a sexual gourmand is played down ""a good driver but an immortal fuck"" somebody labels him yet his tastes are shown as disappointingly earthbound. We get the seduction of a kindly nurse and the unforeseen marriage to Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde) who then left her handsome speed king for Richard Burton--surely the gold standard for unalloyed seventies conduct. But where is the circuit managers wife at the Canadian Grand Prix track whom Hunt seduced in the back of an ambulance while her husband suspecting nothing stood nearby? Where are the thirty-three British Airways flight attendants whom if you accept the legend Hunt managed to sleep with in batches before the Japanese Grand Prix? Well this is a Ron Howard movie. However inflammatory the theme his instinctive caution and nicety of taste show through. His best film remains ""Apollo 13"" a perfect storm of decency and daring and it comes as no surprise that his sympathies in ""Rush"" incline toward Lauda and his calm calculations of risk. Hence the lovely sequence in which Lauda stranded in Italy hitches a ride first with the ravishing Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara) who has no idea who he is and second with a couple of locals who know exactly who he is and who egg him on to drive their little Fiat as only he can do. Lara is a wonderful actress never less than watchful in her elegance and the nervy Bruhl allows himself to be unhunched as it were by her charm. Here you sense is Howard at his most relaxed as he was in ""Splash"" almost thirty years ago. So how to gird himself for the lunatic rigors of the track? Answer hire Anthony Dod Mantle as a cinematographer. He usually works for directors like Danny Boyle on ""Slumdog Millionaire"" or Lars von Trier on ""Antichrist"" and it speaks well for Howard that he sought out someone to embolden the look of his film--to stoke its colors and give it the blaze of a waking dream. Sometimes the plan overheats; to cut from Hunt making out in a toilet to a closeup of pistons shunting back and forth in his well-oiled engine is not the most subtle flight of visual wit. Where we crave intensity of course is when the drivers overtake each other by the width of a cats tail; when their crash helmets filmed from inside mist over in the onslaught of rain; or above all when Lauda has his dire accident at Nurburgring the notorious German circuit in August 1976. To this day what happened in the ensuing weeks defies belief. I will say no more except that this passage of the film reinforces the strange suggestion evident from the start that motor racing is a lonely sport. You could come away from ""Rush"" under the impression not merely that Hunt and Lauda went head-to-head but that all the other heads--of their fellow-drivers of the backup teams even of demigods like Enzo Ferrari for whom Lauda drove--were barely more than backdrops and props. Can this be true? Maybe we should expect it of Peter Morgan the screenwriter of ""Rush"" and a specialist in the two-man character crunch. We had Tony Blair and Gordon Brown in ""The Deal"" directed by Stephen Frears; then came ""Frost/Nixon"" also for Ron Howard; and now we have Lauda versus Hunt. Morgans ability to lock together opposing temperaments has grown efficient to a fault; the airtight verges on the airless. Not for a second for example would you guess from ""Rush"" that the two drivers had occasionally shared an apartment in London when they were in Formula 3 or that Lauda once called Hunt ""an open honest-to-God pal"" and telephoned from the hospital after Nurburgring to wish him a happy birthday. (In the film he gazes up from his sickbed at a TV screen seething at his rivals success.) Still it is a writers privilege to trim and tailor at will and everybody loves a duel. It would take the dullest of curmudgeons not to enjoy the surge of this saga accurate or not and the excesses of what already feels like a distant age. As Lauda informs us there were twenty-five drivers in Formula 1 and each year two of them died; but boy how the others lived. The debut feature from Stuart Blumberg ""Thanks for Sharing"" is about sex addiction in Manhattan. I thought that this was like bratwurst addiction in Bavaria evenly and thickly spread through the population but no; on the evidence of this movie it mainly affects professional white guys who go to meetings vent their issues and mentor one another through times of horny crisis. There is Mike (Tim Robbins) the leader of the pack and the master as ""Seinfeld"" would put it of his domain. There is Adam (Mark Ruffalo) who for the past five years has been ""sober""--the correct word apparently for not watching porn not having too many girlfriends at once and not masturbating. (What does he do all day?) And there is Neil (Josh Gad) a doughnut-gorging doctor although his real area of expertise is rubbing up against women in the subway. If you want some idea of how bizarre the tone of this movie is imagine if the Michael Fassbender character from ""Shame"" had been teleported into a romantic comedy. Each of our male sufferers is given a river to cross Mike must learn to love his estranged son (Patrick Fugit) who is a drug addict; Adam must reveal his condition to a radiant new beloved (Gwyneth Paltrow) who is a cancer survivor; and Neil must learn to ride a bike. One moment we are groin-deep in the bleakness of compulsion and the next we watch a fat wobbly guy cycling along to a soundtrack of jovial tunes. No doubt there are differing views on sex addiction (""Is that even a real thing?"" a woman asks) but you emerge none the wiser though a little tetchier from such floundering. Yet ""Thanks for Sharing"" is worth it because of Pink. This is not her first movie; we all treasure the voice-over work that she did for ""Happy Feet Two."" Here she is onscreen in the solid flesh acting under her own name Alecia Moore although given the topic I kind of wish that the word ""Pink"" had filled the screen in the opening credits. She plays Dede who is addicted to pretty much everything but her performance--far more robust and more rooted than anything delivered by the experienced stars--suggests a tough spirit addicted to life. What is wrong with Dede feels woven into what is right with her and there isnt a stray thread of self-indulgence. Most of the folks in the film you want to slap but not Dede. You want to cheer her on bringing back the old motto from ""Funny Face."" Think Pink.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

"Rush directed by Ron Howard reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Rush Is a Sleekly Assembled Thrill Machine Rush Is a Sleekly Assembled Thrill Machine Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 27 2013 657 PM Rush A sleekly assembled thrill machine. By Dana Stevens Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl in Ron Howards Rush. Photo courtesy Jaap Buitendijk/Universal The rivalry between two fiercely competitive temperamentally opposed race-car drivers is a subject thats had at least two memorable cinematic treatments in recent years. In the 2006 comedy Talladega Nights Will Ferrell and Sasha Baron Cohen were hilarious as NASCAR drivers bent on each others destruction while the mesmerizing 2010 documentary Senna traced the real-life competition between the Brazilian Formula One driver Ayrton Senna and his career archrival the French driver Alain Prost. When I heard that Ron Howard was taking on similar material in straightforward dramatic form with Rush--a kind of joint biopic of 70s Formula One stars Niki Lauda and James Hunt--I wondered if it was possible to make a movie about a death match between racing rivals without slipping into parody. But Howard (aided by screenwriter Frost/Nixon screenwriter Peter Morgan) has gone and done it Rush is an outsize Hollywood spectacle about two outsize personalities in conflict a sleekly assembled thrill machine that makes up in excitement for what it lacks in nuance. Rush is an outsize Hollywood spectacle about two outsize personalities in conflict that makes up in excitement for what it lacks in nuance. Rush focuses on the years between 1970 and 1976 following its protagonists rise from scrappy third-string race-car jockeys to archrivals for the Formula One world championship title. Hunt (Chris Hemsworth last seen winging a massive hammer at aliens as The Avengers Thor) is a Brit a daredevil and a notorious playboy given to toking up before big races getting roaring drunk afterward and nailing every attractive woman in sight (in one early scene he beds an emergency-room nurse before she can even finish dressing his wounds). Lauda (Daniel Bruhl a Spanish-born German actor soon to be seen in The Fifth Estate) is Hunts polar opposite in nearly every way a cold technocratic Austrian whose maniacal preparation includes a precise calculation of the mathematical risk he takes with each race. Lauda refuses to go over a 20 percent chance of dying--a degree of caution which sounds more than reasonable to those of us not in the business of hurtling in circles at 170 miles per hour but which earns him the scorn of his more macho colleagues Hunt first among them. From the moment they meet Lauda and Hunt take a strong dislike to one another but theyre also bound together by their obsessive love for speed and for victory. At the track and at press conferences they go out of their way to trash-talk and upstage each other Lauda is always ready to mock Hunts lack of discipline and Hunt Laudas rule-bound prissiness. The two mens personal lives also exist in stark contrast Hunts impulsive marriage to the model Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde) quickly falls apart when she leaves him for Richard Burton while Laudas union with the devoted Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara) is strong enough to make him rethink his approach to risk assessment Is a one-in-five likelihood of dying per race a chance he still wants to take? Its during the event-packed Grand Prix season of 1976 that the Hunt/Lauda rivalry becomes the stuff of which sports legends are made. If like me you know nothing of the events of that year I wont spoil the heart-stopping second half except to say that the Lauda character who in the early scenes comes off as something of a nasty prig emerges as the movies unexpected moral center and its true hero. Bruhl is exceptional in his actorly restraint--given multiple opportunities to win over the audience with easy sentimental uplift he refuses them all to create a character whos prickly and charmless yet oddly admirable. Hemsworths performance is broader--all he really has to do is turn the lion-maned golden-boy charisma up to 11 and keep it there for two hours--but hes irresistible as the rakish Hunt. Rushs title is apropos as the movie shot by Danny Boyles longtime cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle hurtles forward at a sometimes vertiginous pace. Extreme close-ups of pumping pistons and drivers bloodshot eyeballs alternate with soaring aerial views of the cars Hunt calls ""coffins on wheels"" as they careen around the track. Theres also extensive use of a point-of-view shot from within the car that owes a lot to the helmet-mounted cameras that made Sennas race footage so thrilling. The films forward rhythm is slowed only by a few unnecessary detours into overfamiliar biopic territory--do we really need to watch Hunt down an entire bottle of scotch the night after a big defeat as a phonograph needle scratches on a played-out record? This isnt a movie that paints in fine brushstrokes but theres something primally satisfying about the starkness of its last suspenseful faceoff two rivals two cars one rain-drenched racetrack and may the best man win.

Its easy to forget especially on the heels of a movie summer as disappointing as this last one that there are certain things that big-studio motion pictures can do very well.Take Rush the latest film from director Ron Howard and easily one of his best. This ""based on a true story"" auto-racing movie does a number of things very well. But just as important to the movies success are the things it declines to do at all.Related Story Prisoners Moral Exploration or Exploitation? Lets begin with the former. Rush depicts the competition between two larger-than-life Formula One stars British driver James Hunt (played by Aussie Chris Hemsworth) and Austrian driver Niki Lauda (played by German-Spaniard Daniel Bruhl). Though the tale begins in the early 1970s the bulk of the action takes place in 1976 with the two men locked in a neck-and-neck struggle for the world championship trading victories at grand prix after grand prix Brazil South Africa Spain Monaco Belgium France Great Britain Germany...  This was a period in Formula One when losing a race was far from the worst of plausible outcomes. As Lauda notes early in the film ""Twenty-five drivers start Formula One each year and two of us die."" (Its arguably an exaggeration but only a slight one. Thankfully a variety of additional safety measures have altered the sport such that no driver has been killed since 1994.)The contrasting styles and personalities of Hunt and Lauda could hardly be more striking. Hunt is gorgeous charismatic fond of booze and drugs and women and recklessly drawn to the mortal nature of his chosen sport. Lauda by contrast is precise and aloof with prominent buck teeth that earn him the nickname ""the rat."" While Hunt enthuses that a Formula One car is essentially ""a bomb on wheels"" Lauda sees racing as merely a means to an end. ""If I had more talent and could win more money at something else"" he explains at one point ""I would.""Hemsworth (Marvel fans know him as Thor) is excellent as Hunt charming gregarious and in his way entirely genuine. But it is Bruhls Lauda--sulky diffident obstinate rude--who gradually runs away with the film inch by inch checkered flag by checkered flag. Though Bruhl was good as the lovestruck Nazi war hero Frederik Zoller in Tarantinos Inglourious Basterds his performance here is a minor revelation nuanced unsentimental and utterly original.Howards direction is crisp and lively neatly interweaving the racing sequences and character studies for a satisfying blend of the kinetic and dramatic. The 1976 Formula One season itself (the details of which I will not divulge here) offers a cinematic arc brimming with tension spectacle and surprise. If this sports story didnt exist Hollywood would have had to invent it.Theres no tedious backstory here no maudlin explanations of why Hunt and Lauda came to be the men they were.The neatest trick Howard engineers however may be his forbearance of the narrative larding in which big-budget films such as this one seem almost inevitably to enmesh themselves. Theres no tedious backstory here no maudlin explanations of why Hunt and Lauda came to be the men they were. Though the movie cycles through both ups and downs it does so efficiently neither basking in success nor wallowing in misfortune. And even as Howard offers up this clash of outsized personalities (and the moral paradigms they perhaps represent) Rush remains refreshingly agnostic on the subject of their relative merits. Theres no message here--or rather any message one chooses to take away will be equivocal conditional and lacking the whiff of sanctimony that so often pervades big awards-season fare.Rush is not a particularly deep film. But more importantly it is not a film that mistakes itself for deep. However fascinating they may have been Hunt and Lauda were after all race car drivers their story the perfect grist for a well-crafted but unassuming entertainment like the one Howard has provided us. And this self-knowledge makes Rush in some ways a wiser film than many that aspire to loftier goals.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

JAAP BUITENDIJK UNIVERSAL PICTURES View slideshow From left Chris Hemsworth is the playboy Englishman James Hunt and Daniel Bruhl is the perfectionist Austrian Niki Lauda in ""Rush.""JAAP BUITENDIJK UNIVERSAL STUDIOS By MICHAEL SRAGOW / ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF RushStarring Chris Hemsworth Daniel Bruhl Directed by Ron Howard Rated R for sexual content nudity language some disturbing images and brief drug use Running time 2 hours 3 minutes Playing Throughout Orange County (See theaters and movie times)The quick hitStripped-down characters and skeletal dramaturgy limit this movie about the real-life Formula 1 racing rivalry of James Hunt and Niki Lauda but harrowing track scenes and an affecting second half provide some vivid compensation. Grade B Strapping dashing Formula 1 challenger James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) calls the reigning champion Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) ""the rat"" by dint of his rodent-like appearance (complete with enormous overbite). At least one reviewer has said that both characters are so elemental they might as well be the tortoise and the hare. Surely all these animal comparisons are a bit off. Bruhls Lauda may not be another Norse god like Hemsworth whos best known to moviegoers as Thor but he does look like an Austrian version of Jean-Louis Trintignant - who after all set the standard for romantic racecar drivers in Claude Lelouchs ""A Man and A Woman."" (Baby-boomers cue buh-buh-buh-buh-bah music in your memories please.) And if Lauda is a ground-hugging cautious racer compared to Hunts high-flyer hes certainly not a tortoise - after all hes still super-fast. The fable that ""Rush"" really resembles is ""The Grasshopper and the Ant"" with Hunt as the swinging English jet-setter hopping from one hedonistic hot spot to the next while fiddling joyously with fast cars and fast women and Lauda as the scrupulous industrious drone whose efforts are so fierce he roars past most of his competitors. What should make ""Rush"" a crowd-pleaser - apart from its splendid visceral depiction of the pairs on-track rivalry - is that director Ron Howard and screenwriter Peter Morgan who last teamed on the crackerjack ""Frost/Nixon"" have shaped the factual material so that the film ends with both men as winners. No sad cicada here starving in the snow. The only snow Hunt puts in his face is cocaine. Still even car fans drawn in by the virtuoso race scenes should find the first half rough going. I know the adulation of Steve Jobs has made ruthless monomania the preferred leadership mode but its difficult to see Hunt and Lauda lord it over their women as well as their teams. Lauda tells his bride Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara) that hell be a bad husband and probably forget her birthday but if hes going to do this marriage thing he might as well do it with her. Hunt weds a worldly knockout model Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde) then cant understand why shed want to go skiing in Gstaad while hes obsessed with searching for his next ""ride."" The dramaturgy is so skeletal were not surprised when she later says that she met Richard Burton on the ski trip busting up two marriages. Its meant to be unflinchingly adult to make these guys so unlikable. The problem is much of the time the filmmakers also make them uninteresting. Maybe it was the golden locks but watching Hunt I kept thinking he should be more like General Custer as rendered by Ian Frazier in ""The Great Plains"" ""Custers life demonstrates the power of having fun .... Custer was good at being loved .... Custers fame is the victory of fun and myth over complicated history."" All the moviemakers give Hemsworth to play with as Hunt is a generalized jauntiness. If hes supposed to be a witty fellow he doesnt demonstrate it often - unless its intended to be a knee-slapper when he calls Lauda ""a goose-stepper."" By the way for a movie thats more than two hours long ""Rush"" conveys few of the national and commercial rooting interests that fuel Formula 1 fans. It also barely touches on the politics of Grand Prix racing except when it comes to Hunt influencing more of his peers because hes more simpatico. (The documentary ""Senna"" did all that in 106 minutes.) The film finally gains emotional traction when (spoiler alert) Lauda crashes and burns in the middle of the 76 season. Bruhl is peerless at gritted-teeth determination. As Lauda watches Hunt on TV racking up wins while he endures skin grafts Bruhl conveys how the drivers competitive urge sparks him back to life - and returns him to the sport earlier than anyone predicted. ""Rush"" finally finds its theme the best should push the best to be better. Does the filmmaking clarify the sport for non-initiates? Not really. The movie spends more time observing Lauda getting his lungs vacuumed than it does elucidating what goes on in a Formula 1 pit. But a couple of car scenes are inspired. When Lauda shows his future wife and two fans what he can do on a normal road in a regular road car the movie demonstrates his pinpoint skills for bobbing weaving and accelerating in the most down-to-earth and exciting way. And the climactic race in the rain in Japan is both impressionistic and precise bringing us in and out of the drivers perspective as they focus on the tracks curves and their competitors lights through torrential downpours. Even better Hunt begins to register more nobly as he comprehends the profundity of Laudas comeback. Theres a brooding Byronic streak to Hemsworths ebullient charisma. I hope this multi-toned actor who became a star as the god of thunder gets to explore his range soon in a movie thats a lot less like ""Days of Thunder.""

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post R. 123 minutes. At area theaters. ""Rush"" is a fable. Sure director Ron Howards thrill-ride is based on a legendary season in Formula 1 racing but the movie (with its light and dark rivals and its doubling of themes) has the layers of a bedtime tale -- albeit a rumbling and roaring at times randy and romantic one. In 1976 the Formula 1 racing world was treated to an intense dangerous star-making rivalry that pitted James Hunt an upstart with playboy elan against Austrian automotive rationalist and world champion Nikk Lauda. Handsome and present Chris Hemsworth brings the right stuff to the Brit Hunt. This is the world pre-HIV pro-birth control. ""Rush"" has sex drugs and the appropriate soundtrack. When Hunt wanders into an ER after a race he gets nursed in every way. Next day that healer is cheering him on. Busy actor Daniel Bruhl does moody work as the dour Lauda who turns his back on the familys banking business to race cars. ""Rush"" opens on a rainy racetrack in Germany. Luada narrates. His voice here comes as something of a surprise. After all Hunt is the type of protagonist women want to be with and men want to be as the saying goes. Even Lauda is aware of this. Like a rash of films this season ""Rush"" begins in a particularly potent moment then goes back in time before looping then passes where it began. Its a deft way to recount how the two men -- so seemingly different -- wound up spending a life-altering year chasing points chasing each other chasing glory all the time tempting fate. With 12 F1 fatalities the 1970s was a particularly deadly decade. While Lauda and Hunts differences are underscored the film smartly subtly touches on their similarities. Theres something visually resonant about Olivia Wilde and Alexandra Maria Lara in their roles as Suzy Miller (Hunts wife) and Marlene Lauda. Although the actresses dont look alike really their casting adds to a sense of cosmic affinity. ""Rush"" fires on all cylinders Anthony Dod Mantles cinematography is ultra-aware of the sexy-cool-moneyed vibe that permeated that world but also of the steely arousing vigor of machines. Howard relies on the two editors Mike Hill and Dan Hanley he gathered for ""Apollo 13"" and ""A Beautiful Mind."" The casting of the movies leads is impeccable. Writer Peter Morgan (""The Queen"" ""Frost/Nixon"") understands the lure and burden of power in this case personal charisma and horsepower. It is not just the adrenaline jitters induced by the action that makes ""Rush"" among Howards best films. Indeed it would be a mistake to think because it has guys gals and cars that it was somehow late for its summer flick start time. ""Rush"" takes seriously risk calling competition. This is a deeply adult drama not least because Howard shows the costs of being so driven in a sport in which a driver is encased in a potential fireball. I pitied the folks eating chicken wings at a preview screening when the action went from a slick track to a hospital burn ward.

"Rush (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Rush (R) This story of the legendary rivalry between two Grand Prix racers in the 1970s is a furious entertainment for grown-ups. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com9/26/2013 Editor rating 3 When the 17th century Spanish philosopher Baltasar Gracian wrote ""A wise man gets more use from his enemies than a fool from his friends"" he might as well been summarizing the theme of Ron Howards Rush. This furiously entertaining movie about the legendary rivalry between Grand Prix drivers James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) makes the case that the stronger your competition in any given field the better you will become. Although the story of Hunt and Lauda is well-known around the world they never became household names in the United States where Formula One racing didnt catch on the way it did everywhere else. Screenwriter Peter Morgan who previously collaborated with Howard on Frost/Nixon wisely mines the real-life events for suspense. And even if you know how it all ends the films uncharacteristically loose and inventive direction makes getting there a thrill. Howard who has too often stuck to a rigid dull style (A Beautiful Mind The Da Vinci Code Missing Apollo 13) finally breaks free of his prestige-picture shackles. He invests the movie with the carnival-funhouse energy of Boogie Nights (split screens pop songs montages) and he shoots the racing sequences in a hyper-realistic manner that not only puts you in the seats of the drivers but also inside their heads and even their engines all pumping pistons and oil and gasoline. Conveying a sense of what it feels like to drive at 170 miles per hour is critical to Rush because it takes a certain kind of lunatic to participate in this insanely dangerous sport. Hunt who is British and Lauda who is Austrian approach their craft from opposite directions Hunt a spirited bon vivant with the chiseled looks and body of a surfer doesnt really take much seriously whenever hes not on the track. He also never met a woman he couldnt seduce with just a look. Lauda by comparison is an arrogant humorless man who takes pride in the fact no one likes him. He can tell everything about a car just by sitting in it and he knows a lot about design and aerodynamics and the science of racing too He is the Spock to Hunts Captain Kirk. Rush alternates between the mens private lives (Olivia Wilde and Alexandra Maria Lara play the women they end up marrying) and their increasing animosity on the track where they constantly try to beat each other to the finish line by any means possible (including occasionally some dirty pool). The movie would have worked just as well if real life hadnt provided the filmmakers a horrific tragic turn that only intensifies the rivalry. Hemsworth and Bruhl constantly battle for the viewers sympathies You dont always like these guys but you come away with tremendous respect for both. Rush is the kind of Hollywood studio production that has sadly become all too rare -- a smart exciting R-rated entertainment for grown-ups that quickens your pulse and puts on a great show without ever insulting your intelligence.

As Richard points out Christopher Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl are excellent. The racing sequences are very well made and exciting. In other words Richard is right for the most part. Olivia Wilde is not that good. I think her role is just a throwaway. However that aside ""Rush"" is a great movie that is worth your time. Ryansaid on Saturday November 02 2013 25706 PMRush is the best movie I have ever seen. Chris Hemsworth gives the performance of his career and Daniel Bruhl( so good in Inglorious Bastards) is astounding.

"Racing to define a champion Rush review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesRacing to define a champion Rush reviewRon Howards Rush is every bit as commercial as the ad-festooned cars and uniforms of the Formula One racers hes dramatizing. Yet he also gives art house regulars reason to root.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Sept. 26 2013RushStarring Chris Hemsworth Daniel Bruhl Olivia Wilde and Alexandra Maria Lara. Directed by Ron Howard. Opening Sept. 27 at GTA theatres. 123 minutes. 14A.Ron Howards Rush is every bit as commercial as the ad-festooned cars and uniforms of the Formula One racers hes dramatizing. Yet even as he steers directly towards the multiplex he also gives art house regulars reason to start their engines. Article Continued BelowThis is no mere thrill ride by two real-life rival speedsters although it is certainly that. The film also provides a sobering look at what it takes to be a true champion.Youd expect Rush to cut to the chase but Howard and screenwriter Peter Morgan (The Queen) tease us a bit in establishing the ego vs. egghead rivalry between 1976 top guns James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl). Neither racer is an easy sell although the casting is right on with two rising actors who are ripe for serious leading roles.Hunt is blond British and brash as quick to chase nubile young things (including Olivia Wildes gimlet-eyed Suzy) as he is to tear down the pavement.Lauda is icy Austrian and austere a believer that science as much as talent leads to winning results with his state-of-the-art Ferrari. When hes matched with a woman (Alexandra Maria Laras sultry Marlene) it seems more by accident than by design.The two men could hardly be more different apart from a shared determination to win and closely matched driving skills. Verbal sparks fly as they constantly challenge each other both on and off the race course. When Lauda delivers a major setback to Hunts plans by filing an official protest against a tiny mechanical infraction by the latters McLaren car a shared autograph session turns ugly.""Rules are rules"" Lauda tells Hunt.""Yes and rats are rats"" Hunt retorts.The film follows the 1976 season from its testosterone-fuelled start in Brazil to its rain-soaked finale in Japan carrying us with it the entire way.Howard and cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle (Slumdog Millionaire) dont stint on the burning rubber and skid marks -- racing fans will love it -- but they and scripter Morgan also sustain the Sunday drivers in the audience.A near-tragedy during a race in Germany abruptly changes the leader board in the Formula One season and the emotional stakes in the film. (Its worth mentioning that this section also tests the audiences tolerance for visceral crash and hospital scenes.)Rush shifts into a higher gear of contemplation one that asks us to reflect on the high cost of being on top of a sport where a single bad turn can end a career -- or a life.We learn to appreciate that Hunt and Lauda both have more going for them than an almost supernatural need for speed.Best thing of all about Rush is how it maintains suspense until the final flag drops. The 1976 Formula One season truly was an amazing test of skill bravery and resolve.Do yourself a favor and dont Google the real-life results before seeing the film.

September 26 2013 -- 257pm Video (0158)  Your weekend box office guide. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert ""Rush"" is a Formula One racing drama of almost irresistible forward momentum. The on-track action is blistering the filmmaking sure-footed (even as cars fishtail into catastrophic crashes) the characters bigger than life. Even more important it avoids the stock plotting that turns most sports movies into bland emotional pick-me-ups. Its one of the best films of Ron Howards career certainly the most surprising. Who knew that this competent craftsman had such a furiously exciting sex-drenched story in him? By granting equal time to two historical figures devil-may-care English golden boy James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and his dark calculating Austrian rival Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) the film turns their racing rivalry into a collision between diametrically opposed personalities. Hemsworth is nearly as glamorous a demi-god here as he is in Thor movies. His rodent-faced rival Bruhl who played the film-buff German soldier in ""Inglourious Basterds"" seems like a central casting villain. Hes an obnoxious know-it-all doubly irritating because hes usually right. Dont decide too quickly who to root for. Our sympathies shift as fast as a racer negotiating a tight curve. The shrewd script by Peter Morgan (""Frost/Nixon"" ""The Last King of Scotland"" ""The Queen"") stresses the parallels in the mens lives. Each came from a family that disapproved of high-risk sports. Each man is petulant and childish. Hunt was a callous playboy Lauda coldly indifferent to his wife. Each is willing to put his life at risk for a jolt of adrenaline and adulation. Theyre deeply selfish giving little thought to the effect their risky careers have on friends and families. The virile impulsive extrovert and the chilly methodical introvert are kindred spirits pushing each other to greater glory and ever nearer disaster. Its a testament to the actors abilities that we find them partially sympathetic all the same. Universal Chris Hemsworth is racer James Hunt in ""Rush."" There are clumsy passages here. We really dont need a debauchery montage set to Bowies ""Fame"" to grasp that Hunt was publicity-drunk or a scene of Lauda painfully pressing his crash-scarred head into a racing helmet to understand that he was obsessively competitive. Still ""Rush"" red-lines the spectacle and exhilaration of the wildly eventful mid-70s Formula One circuit while delivering something more complex and gratifying than a stock underdog story. Colin Covert has covered films for the Star Tribune for 20 years interviewing Peter Jackson Kate Winslet Steven Spielberg Cate Blanchett Quentin Tarantino Neil Gaiman and John Travolta to name a few. Colins job as a film critic consists mostly of thinking up synonyms for ""mediocre."" He still gets a thrill when the lights dim and all too often a bigger thrill when they come on again.

Starring Chris Hemsworth Daniel Bruhl Olivia Wilde and Alexandra Maria Lara. Directed by Ron Howard. (R. 122 minutes.) In racing films its easy for the actors to get upstaged by the cars. Theres a junkyard of movies - ""Driven"" ""Days of Thunder"" ""Le Mans"" - that faltered because filmmakers used their shiny fast-moving automobiles as an excuse to ignore the story. ""Rush"" brings as much raw horsepower as anything else in the genre. But its success comes from a careful balance by director Ron Howard and especially screenwriter Peter Morgan. The ego trips and sexuality and driving are all filmed with equal intensity to the point where the emotions and flesh and crunched metal seem to blend together. The movies only major problem is that the tension sometimes overwhelms. Its a myth that there are no good racing movies. The exceptional documentary ""Senna"" about legendary Formula One race car driver Ayrton Senna came out just three years ago. (And ""Talladega Nights the Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" from 2006 counts too right?) Even so Howard and Morgan set a high degree of difficulty when they chose to chronicle the complex F1 rivalry between drivers Niki Lauda of Austria and James Hunt of Britain. ""Rush"" offers a brief background for each focusing on the surprising similarities between the playboy Hunt and savant-like Lauda who are both fearless drivers estranged from their families. Their hatred of each other comes down to approach Hunt needs to blow off steam in the form of sex and boozing; Lauda has an analytical mind that cant be distracted. The bulk of the action focuses on the events of the 1976 Formula One season a year filled with drama tragedy and an ending that was made for cinema. Chris Hemsworths James Hunt is on the movie poster but the movie hinges on Daniel Bruhls nuanced performance as Lauda. The actor could have easily settled into a straight villain role if he didnt offer regular clues to the humanity inside - many in the scenes with his lover Marlene portrayed with a believable dedication by Alexandra Maria Lara. Morgan writes choice crowd-pleasing scenes for both drivers whether its Laudas awkward marriage proposal or Hunts sexual conquests. But the more subtle moments carry the film. During the few meaningful connections between Lauda and Hunt Morgans script runs screaming from sports movie cliches. The trailers for ""Rush"" betray the reality that this is a drama with some racing in it not a racing movie with some drama. Taking liberties with timelines and making composite characters is standard for this kind of movie. But Howard revs the drama too deep into the red line particularly in the end. Subtle narration by Hemsworth and Bruhl gives way to over-the-top racing commentary (""In Formula One its known as the graveyard"" ... ""In these conditions it must be close to impossible to drive a 450 horsepower car"") - exposition that isnt necessary given the strength of the rest of the script. A journalists rude question during a Lauda news conference is distractingly over the top and belongs in a lesser film. As a positive Howard proves that directing action is one of his underrated strengths. The racing scenes are dynamic and easy to follow with a sheen that brings the 1970s into sharp relief. And credit to whoever is responsible for the soundtrack which includes a Thin Lizzy song and the superior British version of ""Gimme Some Lovin "" by Steve Winwood. For those whistling ""The Andy Griffith Show"" theme song before entering the theater know that this film more than earns its R rating. Mangled human remains in the crash scenes and multiple bare breasts and backsides are featured. Frances Bavier would definitely blush but shed still be proud of another strong directing effort from her youngest co-star. Rush Drama.

Comments click to enlarge Rush Video Rated R  123 minutes  2013 Ron Howards penchant for the formulaic and sentimental is on full display in this action drama about James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) rival Formula 1 racers who went toe-to-toe during the 1976 Grand Prix. Bathed in warm cinematography--almost identical to that used in Howards underrated genre bender The Dilemma (2011)--and making unexpected use of avant-garde framing techniques its easily his most visually ambitious work to date though the computer-generated race scenes pale in comparison to Justin Lins pulsating Fast amp; Furious films. This is entertaining enough but ultimately its spuriously triumphant Oscar-baiting fluff.

RELATED NEWS Interview Ron Howard 10 best Ron Howard films By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Wed Sep 25 2013 1246 PM If you follow Formula One racing history you know all about what happened during the 1976 season. If you dont it doesnt matter. You will still get a thrill out of ""Rush"" Ron Howards propulsive film about the battle between British playboy driver James Hunt and straight-laced Viennese driver Niki Lauda. The story of that fateful season when Lauda was defending his championship with Hunt hot on his heels is compelling enough on its own; when tragedy strikes it becomes even more so. And Howard whose first job as a director was the 1977 Roger Corman-produced ""Grand Theft Auto"" has captured what is surely the greatest racing footage ever shot. Its not showy or over the top. Instead its almost hyperrealistic giving the audience a taste of what its like to be in the ""little coffins"" as one driver describes the cars. Theres something to that. As Lauda played by Daniel Bruhl explains in a voice-over at the beginning of the film Formula One was averaging about two deaths a year on the track in 1976. Hunt played by Chris Hemsworth later says ""The closer you are to death the more alive you feel."" Which means they feel very alive indeed. Hunt especially is one of those live-life-to-the-fullest guys (which may have contributed to his later death at 45 of a heart attack). He drinks he smokes he has a patch on his suit that says ""Sex the breakfast of champions"" which seems like a pretty accurate description of his existence. But man can he drive. Hes working his way up the lower circuits when we meet him. And when Lauda meets him. They take an instant dislike to each other. Lauda is from a rich family but instead of becoming a banker he drove his family crazy by driving cars. Very fast. He is as meticulous as Hunt is spontaneous poring over every detail of his car. He doesnt have friends or a social life. He has racing. Lauda wins the Formula One championship in 1975; it seems inevitable that he and Hunt will compete for the 1976 title. Along the way each gets married Hunt to model Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde) who would eventually leave him for Richard Burton which tells you the crowd these guys ran in. Lauda marries Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara) even though he tells her up front hes not going to put much effort into the romance of it all. Lauda takes the points lead early in the season and holds onto it with Hunt in second. We get looks at the tracks around the world where they race. Then they arrive at the Nurburgring track in Germany. Its nickname is the Graveyard and thats at the best of times. On race day its pouring rain. Lauda calls a drivers meeting and wants to cancel the race. The charismatic Hunt knowing this will give Lauda an even greater lead in points argues that the race should go on and it does. The results are horrific. Without going into too much detail suffice it to say that a gruesome accident will change the course of the season dramatically but also lead to an inspiring rehabilitation and comeback that is hard to believe (and often difficult to watch). Peter Morgans screenplay is shallow in places particularly when it comes to women. And other drivers are mostly just props straw men for Hunt and Lauda to mow down on the track. But Hemsworth and Bruhl are outstanding. Their story is what drives the movie two men different in every way except for their unyielding desire to win. Which of course makes them more alike than they would ever want to admit. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter twitter.com/goodyk.

"Rush movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs One foot on the brake in Rush  1/2Ron Howards Rush takes a cautious look at 2 risk-taking Formula One rivals in the 70sSeptember 26 2013|Michael PhillipsStill from the film ""Rush."" (Jaap Buitendijk/Universal Studio)Its big brash and dramatically it goes in circles. The first two may be enough for most people especially if theyre into Formula One racing to overlook the third.With ""Rush"" director Ron Howard brings a long earnest careers worth of expertise to bear on a two-headed Formula One biopic dramatizing the rivalry between dashingly louche Englishman James Hunt played by Chris Hemsworth and the rigid cautious Austrian ace Niki Lauda portrayed by Daniel Bruhl. The Grand Prix competition between Hunt and Lauda in the 1976 racing season full of tense reversals and scary track conditions all over the world is more than enough movie for a movie. On a technical and atmospheric level Howard and his collaborators have a ball with the 1970s-ness of everything from the hair to the clothes to the widescreen supersaturated images of blazing color.For Howard who started out directing features 36 years ago with ""Grand Theft Auto"" ""Rush"" ushers him back into his own past (he was acting on ""Happy Days"" on TV during this time) while allowing him to exploit his filmmaking knowledge. Theres a fair amount of digital effects work in the racing sequences designed to push you ever closer to the high-velocity death lurking around every hairpin curve.If ""Rush"" feels a little hollow the reason lies with screenwriter Peter Morgan whose play ""Frost/Nixon"" Howard filmed to pleasing results. Morgan has long proved himself adept at intertwining interdependent biographical studies. In ""The Queen"" for which Helen Mirren won her Oscar the character of British Prime Minister Tony Blair (played by Michael Sheen) achieved equal narrative importance.In ""Rush"" Morgan treats the men jockeying for position throughout as contrasting pencil sketches of 70s-era princes behind the wheel. One is a sober meticulous character the other a carouser who must be taught by life and circumstance to respect his rival. ""Twenty-five people start Formula One"" Lauda explains at the beginning ""and each year two die. What kind of person does a job like this?""A gut-wrenching crash plays a major part in this story by factual necessity though to be sure Howard is not making a documentary here. (For a terrific Formula One documentary do yourself a favor and see director Asif Kapadias ""Senna"" about the Brazilian Grand Prix racer Ayrton Senna and his rival Frenchman Alain Prost.) By nature a cautious and tidy dramatist screenwriter Morgans sensibility is at odds with the material. The writer doesnt do much of anything with Lauda establishing him as a by-the-book prig and leaving it at that. Also the multilingual Bruhl (""Inglourious Basterds"") works hard but hes pretty dull on screen.If the film finds an American audience itll be because of Hemsworth best known for swingin the hammer in ""Thor."" Hunt a charismatically reckless party boy is the kind of guy (according to the script if not real life) who proposes to model Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde in a swank variety of enormous hats) mere seconds after they meet. Hemsworth lives for excess and just as Hunt brought a boozy sort of panache to the sport Hemsworth conveys genuine enthusiasm for whatever hes doing on screen without going over the top.Where the events of 1976 took these two is fascinating history. But ""Rush"" while never dull rarely feels dramatically alive; it hits its marks dutifully and darts onward.mjphillipstribune.com""Rush"" - 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating R (for sexual content nudity language some disturbing images and brief drug use)Running time 203Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesInterview Chris Hemsworth Olivia Wilde Rush Into TorontoSeptember 7 2013Toronto Rush of Awards AdrenalineSeptember 9 2013Rush Revs Its Engines at London PremiereSeptember 2 2013Ron Howards Rush for Independent Film FinancingAugust 21 2013Film Review Ron Howards RushSeptember 3 2013Find More Stories AboutHappy DaysGrand PrixRushRon HowardTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0924-rush-20130926,0,4581727.column",200,rush(2013)17,rush(2013),chicagotribune

"Review Rush from Ron Howard is one smart thriller - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Rush from Ron Howard is one smart thrillerBy Tony Hicksthicksbayareanewsgroup.comPosted 09/24/2013 035758 PM PDTUpdated 09/25/2013 040440 PM PDT""Rush"" may or may not be a big hit at the box office. But it definitely will cause a spike in speeding tickets among people driving home from theaters.Actually ""Rush"" which opens Friday likely will be a hit among lovers of action thrillers and sports movies along with movie snobs who need a screaming roller-coaster ride every now and again. It has more things going for it than one might think. In other words the Oscar buzz surrounding the film is warranted. This image released by Universal Pictures shows Chris Hemsworth in a scene from ""Rush."" (AP Photo/Universal Pictures Jaap Buitendijk) ( Jaap Buitendijk ) Director Ron Howard -- not necessarily known for seat-of-the-pants action -- takes his audience into the high-adrenaline world of Formula One auto racing thanks to some snappy editing and cinematography that seemingly pulls you onto the racetrack and into the death-defying cars. Its a sexy sometimes messy look at a sport that is often both -- and we get to see the stars at both their best and worst without overglorification. Much of the credit for the well-paced well-developed story goes to screenwriter Peter Morgan (""The Queen"" ""Frost/Nixon"").Advertisement The thing about ""Rush"" is it seemingly adopts a good-guy-vs.-bad-guy premise early on but it quickly morphs into much more. Its based on the true story of the 1976 Formula One season and the rivalry between two of racings top drivers British party boy James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and serious and desperate Austrian World Champion Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl). The two could not be more different and more suited to a bitter rivalry. Hunt is handsome gregarious and naturally talented; Lauda is aesthetically challenged and acerbic and has had to work for everything he has earned. Youre even reminded at one point that they were on opposite sides of two world wars. On the surface it seems rather easy to pick one to root for.The rivalry goes back six years to when both drivers were lighting up car racings lesser circuits. As they move up there is lots of jealousy between the two not to mention name-calling trash-talking and on-track battles. By the time both are in their prime during the 1976 Formula One season Lauda is defending world champion and Hunt is right on his tail as second-best. Hemsworths portrayal of the cocky and troubled driver is first-rate. He shows his acting chops as Hunts overindulgent lifestyle and bad reputation cost him personally and professionally (in other words the role is a far cry from Thor). Bruhl is just as good if not better as the relentless Lauda who even as the reigning champ always seems to have something to prove.Yes there are some seriously high-octane racing scenes in ""Rush"" but the film is really a personality study of two incredibly competitive athletes who are opposite in almost every way and who genuinely detest each other. Their rivalry is high-stakes personal pointed and sometimes even humorous. Both men can be alternately likable and contemptible.However a funny thing happens about halfway through ""Rush."" Lauda goes from being stuffy and unsympathetic to something closer to heroic. His serious obsessive nature becomes a virtue as he attempts to come back from a serious setback. Kudos to Howard for not shying away from a scene that while painful to watch magnifies both the dangers of the sport and Laudas resilience.Of course the championship of the season in question isnt decided until the end with a bit of a twist in an otherwise predictable finale. Perhaps most rewarding is that by then its much tougher to choose sides.""Rush"" is much more than a sports film partly because of how Howard approaches the film and partly because the very nature of Formula One racing creates as visceral a sense of danger as any beast or natural disaster. You spend at least half the movie on the edge of your seat and not just because youre rooting for someone to win or lose. ""Rush"" offers great action and drama largely because it takes great pains to bring us inside a world that has both.Contact Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks or Twitter.com/insertfoot.RUSH    Rating R (sexual content nudity language some disturbing images brief drug use).Cast Chris Hemsworth Daniel Bruhl Olivia Wilde Alexandra Maria Lara Pierfrancesco FavinoDirector Ron HowardRunning time 2 hours 3 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Curb Your Enthusiasm The long wait for new episodes is almost overGame of Thrones Season 8 definitely the lastReview Holocaust haunts family in The Gathering Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

"Rush | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; rush ) Rush (U.S./U.K./Germany 2013) September 24 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Ron Howard is probably best known for making slick well-produced crowd pleasing motion pictures. From his early days behind the camera with light fare such as Splash to his most accomplished feature Apollo 13 to his Oscar-winning A Beautiful Mind Howard has enjoyed critical and popular success. Recent years have not been as kind to him however. Re-teaming with screenwriter Peter Morgan (who wrote Frost/Nixon) Howard delves into somewhat darker and more adult territory than has been his norm and emerges with one of his better films of the last decade (trailing only the aforementioned Frost/Nixon for dramatic impact). Rush not only effectively presents a balanced view of the rivalry between two race car drivers but manages the difficult task of taking Formula One racing an inherently non-cinematic sport and translating it to the screen. The race scenes are tense and effectively staged but the movies strength lies in its presentation of the characters the forces that motivate them and the mutual antagonism that fuels their competition. The majority of the film offers a fictionalized recreation of the 1976 Formula One season when James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) went toe-to-toe for the championship. Since about 95% of those viewing the film wont know the ending I wont discuss it here even though its a matter of historical record. Howards changes are minor and mostly focus on personal details like how the characters meet and woo their eventual wives. In fact one could make a convincing argument that the central romances - Hunt with model Suzy Miller (a blond Olivia Wilde) and Lauda with Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara) - are the films least convincing aspects. In the past Howard has shown the capacity to craft love stories but thats something not in evidence in Rush. Technically Rush can be considered a ""sports movie"" in that its about competitors struggling against one another to win a championship. In a generic movie of this sort the ""good guy"" and ""bad guy"" are clearly delineated. Our rooting interest is preordained. This isnt necessarily a bad thing but it skews the drama. For Rush Howard and Morgan take a different tack. The story is nicely balanced between Hunt and Lauda. Both are shown ""warts and all"" with Hunt depicted as a superficial preening self-obsessed party boy and Lauda as a stuffy unpleasant misanthrope. The films unwillingness to ""favor"" one man over the other leads to an unusual dynamic. We become invested in both mens lives and the winning of the championship while still important is a secondary concern. Its safe to say that without each of the men to push the other neither would have been as successful. Laudas accident which is foreshadowed during the first scene is a defining moment in their relationship. He is goaded into participating in a dangerous race because he cant bear to lose face to Hunt. Then as hes recovering Hunts successes during his absence become his motivation to return. As he later notes although Hunt was instrumental in his being injured he was an equally important factor in his recovery. This is no indie production; Howards Hollywood credentials are in evidence. The movie boasts impressive production values including effective period detail. The racing sequences are expertly mounted. And theres plenty of tension in the various contests especially during the rainy finale in Japan. In order to keep events (relatively) accurate the screenplay is limited at times (for example theres no climactic one-on-one ""race off"" between Hunt and Louda because thats not what happened in 1976) but if anything the element of restraint makes things fell less like a cookie-cutter manufactured production. With a reported budget under 40 million Howard cut cost by limiting the number of ""name"" hires. Rush features no A-list stars although Chris Hemsworth by wielding Thors hammer is headed in that direction. Hemsworth is very good here exhibiting personality and range when freed from the constraints of a comic book iteration of a Norse god. Olivia Wilde is another recognizable name but shes pretty awful in a thankfully limited role. Daniel Bruhl gives the best performance of the film melding righteous indignation with a flair for invention and an asocial personality but this may be the first time 99% of the audience is seeing him (although he had supporting roles in both Inglourious Basterds and The Bourne Ultimatum). With a few cuts Rush probably could have gone out with a PG-13. The boobs butts and single shot of a mangled body after a car crash could easily have been sanitized. I respect Howard for not doing that. This isnt a story that will appeal to teenage boys anyway so why try to make it for them? Rush is for adults who like a little (but not too much) ambiguity in their sports stories. Formula One fans who remember 1976 will no doubt delight in the film but for those who (like me) were more interested in other things during the year of Americas bicentennial its not only a good lesson in sports history but an entertaining two hours to spend in a theater.

Even though the film is essentially an anti-buddy buddy movie the buddies here are given a glow.Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) is as detached and methodical as Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) is glamorous and carousing. Racing each other in ever-spiraling death-defying competitions they achieve a kind of yin-yang wholeness. One man doesnt exist entirely without the other.Howard overemphasizes the disparity between the two men. (Didnt Lauda like to party even a little bit?) And the script by Peter Morgan (""The Queen"" ""Frost/Nixon"") is surprisingly lame with instantly unmemorable dialogue. The racing scenes also lack vroom. ""Rush"" isnt bad exactly but its like a standard-issue male action programmer that somehow crept in from an earlier era.

Jaap Buitendijk/Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Jaap Buitendijk/Universal Pictures The radically different Formula One racers James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth left) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) are at the center of Ron Howards Rush a biographical drama thats as strong on character as on cars. Jaap Buitendijk/Universal Pictures Rush Director Ron Howard Genre Action Biopic Running Time 123 minutes Rated R for sexual content nudity language some disturbing images and brief drug use. With Daniel Bruhl Chris Hemsworth Olivia Wilde (Recommended) You might think that if the driving scenes in your auto-racing movie are the least interesting thing about it thats a problem. But its far from a sign of engine trouble for Rush a swift-moving character-rich biopic whose kinetic Grand Prix sequences are constantly being overshadowed by genuinely riveting scenes of ... people talking. But then in a film written by Peter Morgan -- of The Queen and Frost/Nixon -- maybe its no wonder that questions like why they drive why they want to win and who they want to beat take center stage. Rush investigates the psyche of the professional race driver through personal moments on the way to loss and victory and specifically through the twin lenses of Englishman James Hunt and Austrian Niki Lauda whose considerable talents (and egos) led to an intense rivalry that defined Formula One in the 1970s. Lauda and Hunt meet in Formula Three a kind of farm-team race circuit in which Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) as the movie opens has already developed a reputation as an incorrigible ladies man and a racer with a near-reckless desire to win. He lives for the thrill of facing death and barely dodging it and Hemsworth makes his brash devil-may-care swagger thoroughly seductive even as youre aware of the downsides of a thrill-seeking personality. The Salieri to Hunts Mozart is the coldly calculating no-nonsense Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) whose personality repels most everybody even as he backs up his matter-of-fact confidence with results. The Austrians serious-mindedness means he barely even shows off instead putting in the hours training his body and examining every inch of his vehicle to tweak it for maximum speed. Hunts penchant for dangerous driving as well as his playboy tendencies fueled his rivalry with Lauda. Jaap Buitendijk/Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Jaap Buitendijk/Universal Pictures As the tactless and nearly charisma-free Lauda Bruhl clearly relishes playing up the characters off-putting qualities demonstrated best when Lauda moves up to the Formula One class signs with the prestigious Ferrari team and begins berating the crew with claims that their decorated car handles like a cow. Disgusted by Hunts braggadocio and lack of professionalism Lauda makes it a point in every race to edge out the Englishman who naturally loathes Laudas approach to the sport. Covering 6 years and two world-championship contests Rush tracks a narrow enough time frame to delve deep into Hunt and Laudas ambitions personal lives and perspectives on racing. Each makes sacrifices to do what he does not the least of which being the choice to commit to a job that can make you feel alive right before it kills you. Director Ron Howard doesnt shy away from the incredible danger in the sport lingering on gruesome images of driver injuries and deaths long after its been communicated that something terrible has happened. Its a choice that may antagonize (or nauseate) some audiences but it seems intended to do so -- to bring drivers otherwise seen distantly on a TV screen into focus as humans. Howard chooses a few moments to let the film breathe but for the most part -- aside from a clunky first-person narration that book-ends the film -- he propels Rush from scene to scene with a momentum that never lets the thing drag. Its forgivable but still perplexing then that the director isnt quite sure how to best evoke a race on screen. Is it in the firing of the engine? The face of the driver? Their point-of-view? In the motion of the tires? The grass blowing by? Or is it the crowd watching from the stands? For Howard the answer is everything in rotation. It makes for a lively experience but one that hasnt decided whether to embody what it means to watch a Formula One race or to drive in one. The pleasure of seeing Lauda and Hunt square off drives the film satisfyingly forward but its the pleasure of seeing Hemsworth and Bruhl play with such expertly characterized and contrasted characters that elevates Rush from a story of a sporting rivalry to a fuller portrait of complex individuals. Drastically different in attitudes Lauda and Hunt often appear to be two sides of a coin -- Hunt could benefit from Laudas discipline while Lauda desperately could use Hunts ability to enjoy himself. Yet you get the sense that their excesses are what make them special. Balance those qualities and they wouldnt be the fierce competitors they are. Its a rare biopic that can distill the essence of its subjects with such satisfying clarity.

Pack it full of fuel slip in an engine snap on some tires and then send it zooming around at speeds above 200 mph. Oh but first -- put a human being inside. Thats the sport of Formula 1 racing probably given its best big-screen exposure in the John Frankenheimer film ""Grand Prix"" (and the recent thrilling documentary ""Senna""). And its a sport full of speed fire passion egos and hubris. All of which are on display in Ron Howards zippy new slightly old-fashioned drama ""Rush."" Narrowing its focus the film looks at the 1976 racing season and the competition between two men. Theyre both champions in their own way -- and also fascinating contrasts. James Hunt for example is English strikingly handsome and devoted to risk at every turn -- whether its the girls he steals away from other boyfriends or the gambles he takes on the track. Niki Lauda on the other hand is Austrian a bit weaselly-looking and dedicated to minimizing the unknown -- carefully redesigning every car part analyzing every course until he knows he has to win. They are exact opposites -- and so of course perfectly matched for a great competition. A good film too. Ron Howard is a director who prides himself on not working in any one style or even genre but theres a throughline that runs through his work anyway -- an interest in the workplace be it NASA or a newspaper and the way people come together for a common goal. Thats here in ""Rush"" too but the connection interestingly isnt within the racing teams but between the drivers themselves -- the race is the thing and you cant have a good one without rivals who dramatically bring out the best (and the most dangerous) in each other. Taking a cue from ""Senna"" Howard keeps his cameras small and all over the cars to show us dazzling machinery in motion the ground whizzing by in a blur underneath. Playing to his own strengths though he keeps this a movie about character. Based on a script by Peter Morgan (who wrote ""The Queen"" and Howards ""Frost/Nixon"" and has a unapologetic fondness for fictionalizing real people) ""Rush"" quickly sets things up in comfortable old-fashioned terms having the two protagonists spy each other early on. And its loathe at first sight. The film then proceeds in brisk chronological order skipping some details (including quite a bit about the sport actually) while bringing in the mens off-track escapades as they each inexpertly search for love (Hunt is no monogamist; Lauda no romantic.) When ""Rush"" goes outside the track it sometimes goes off the track; theres no real sense of physical passion. Actually apart perhaps from ""Splash"" romance is the one genre Howard has never quite conquered; the love stories here dont quite connect and even the sex scenes are perfunctory as if Howards embarrassed. But Daniel Bruhl is very good as Lauda bravely embracing his more prickly annoying attributes (and then showing the mans true bravery after a horrendous accident). And Chris Hemsworth is charismatic -- golden effortlessly charming and full of absolute who-gives-a-damn insouciance. If ""Thor"" hadnt already made him a star this film would. Except the real stars here are those cars low and sleek and shining in the sun. And racing endlessly side by side -- until one inevitably pulls ahead of the pack. Ratings note The film contains strong language nudity alcohol abuse sexual situations and violence. Rush (R) Universal (123 min.) Directed by Ron Howard. With Chris Hemsworth Daniel Bruhl.

Which is one thing ""Rush"" doesnt do Its a classic story of competitors on a headlong collision course a 450-horsepower movie traveling at 220 miles per hour. But for all its immersion in the roar grease and danger of Formula One the fact-based ""Rush""--about the sports great rivalry of the 1970s--is also more predictable than a pit stop something well-suited to Mr. Howard. Hes made perfectly palatable pictures but never a truly great one partly because he has such a weakness for the commercial and a consequent gift for the obvious. Nothing is ever suggested if it can be said out loud. Very little is beyond further simplification. And the two real-life personalities at the center of his story are so archetypal they may as well be a fuel-injected tortoise and hare. The British champion James Hunt ( Chris Hemsworth) dangerously handsome dangerous behind the wheel is in racing for the glory the fun and the not-always-well-chosen women. Hunts chief rival is Niki Lauda ( Daniel Bruhl) a Teutonic perfectionist with a matter-of-fact awareness of his own superiority no compunction about explaining it to anyone who questions him and a certain satisfied joy in describing a competitors failings to his face. He exists beyond arrogance but in close proximity to loathsome. Focused on the 1976 racing season ""Rush"" travels from the great European tracks to South Africa and Japan as the Hunt-Lauda rivalry--no other drivers seem to exist--seesaws back and forth with personal speed-bumps occasionally intruding on the aerodynamics At one point Hunts estranged wife the ravishing Suzy ( Olivia Wilde) takes up with the actor Richard Burton to the delighted agitation of the tabloids and Hunts vague displeasure. Laudas setbacks are far more serious. Without giving too much away his recovery involves scenes far more disturbing than anything that happens on the track. The great American car movies have usually involved crime (""Bullitt"" ""The Seven-Ups"") speed as an allegory (""Two-Lane Blacktop"") and the occasional one-off masterpiece (""Smokey and the Bandit""). The closest thing to ""Rush"" other than ""Days of Thunder"" and ""Le Mans"" is ""Senna"" the 2010 documentary about a later Formula One rivalry which had the real footage ""Rush"" often simulates. But what happens away from the racing often makes for the better ""Rush"" moments A sequence in which Lauda meets his wife-to-be Marlene ( Alexandra Maria Lara) and--at the behest of a couple of backseat Italians--speeds them all through the provincial countryside is simply wonderful a moment deeper felt than almost anything else in the movie. Like many directors whove made biographical films Mr. Howard cant resist showing in his movies closing moments photos of the real subjects something that always feels like a betrayal of the actors. Nevertheless the shots do show how close Messrs. Bruhl and Hemsworth come or dont to replicating the originals. Mr. Bruhl is equipped with a prosthetic overbite that not only enables him to chew more scenery but displays why Hunt always called his rival a ""rat."" The real Mr. Hunt who died in 1993 was not nearly as handsome as Mr. Hemsworth. But who is? With that long blond mane he suggests a young Brad Pitt and at times seems to be channeling both Peter OToole and Errol Flynn. His face is his fortune and maybe the movies too As was the case with ""Thor"" the advertisement for ""Rush"" is simply a closeup of Mr. Hemsworth. No smoke no lightning no race cars. And certainly no Niki Lauda. Despite being a schematic exercise in storytelling ""Rush"" does take one calculated gamble Neither of the protagonists is close to likable. Both are arrogant reckless unfeeling and ubercompetitive--qualities that no doubt make for world-class drivers but not for naturally sympathetic movie heroes. Its a smart twist on the usual though a calibration in a film about a sport in which everything is oversized except the margins of error. Working from a very clever script by Peter Morgan (""The Queen"") Mr. Howard doesnt pick sides. He lets two distinctly abrasive characters rub up against his viewers chafing them into gear. Watch a clip from the film ""Haute Cuisine"" the story of Daniele Delpeuch and how she was appointed as the private chef for Francois Mitterrand. (Photo/Video The Weinstein Company) Haute Cuisine ""Witty and brisk"" is not the name of a French breakfast cereal but it does describe a certain brand of French film the type that coquettishly flirts with comedy while sprinting in the direction of dry sophisticated charm. Such is ""Haute Cuisine"" which is based on the memoir of Daniele Delpeuch who served as private chef to Francois Mitterrand during several of his years as president of the republic. As played by Catherine Frot the heroine is a model of efficiency devotion to duty everything one might expect and one thing more The personification of creativity crushed by bureaucracy. ENLARGE Haute Cuisine Weinstein Co. As such that character here called Hortense Laborie elevates what might have been a rather gloriously photographed trifle (the seafood the patisserie the salmon-stuffed cabbages) into something considerably more something that has led Hortense--as we see in the entree to the film--to Antarctica. There among a platoon of researchers apparently more accustomed to gruel she has become beloved the Marianne of gustatory integrity. Unfortunately shes also become the target of an Australian television journalist who wants to tell her story. Its not a story Hortense necessarily wants retold. The viewer however is ready for the main course. Four years earlier in flashback Hortense is tracked down on her truffle farm by a brusque team of government emissaries who are as short on charm as they are on information They refuse to tell her where shes being taken but shes willing to be patient. As it turns out her destination--and her base of operations for the next several years--is the Elysee Palace in Paris. Mitterrand wants good simple food for himself and his guests. Hortense is given a mission. Shes also given a rogues gallery of bean counters pencil pushers and one corpulent cook with which to contend. She immediately becomes the bete noire of Lepiq ( Brice Fournier) the long-time ruler of the palaces main kitchen who views Hortense as an intruder a pretender and a threat. Worse shes a woman. There has never been a woman behind the stoves of the palace or allowed to wield the copper cookware that dates back to Louis-Philippe. She must be overthrown. Ms. Frot brings a sympathetic mix of determination and passion to Hortense who dedicates herself to making dishes that suit the president. Jean DOrmesson looks nothing like Mitterrand but seems a bit dotty and is treated more like a king. He certainly eats like one. The preparation of his meals--cockles steaming ducks being stuffed a Sainte-Honore cake being anointed with pastry cream--is hallucinatory. If some enterprising movie concessionaire offered the truffles on toast that Mitterrand enjoys during his late-night snack audiences would be streaming to the lobby to snatch them up. Even after the presidents doctors via the bureaucrats start making Hortenses work impossible she perseveres. For a while. Eventually shes going to head for Antarctica which is certainly a comment on public life and the concept of egalite Its warmer on the ice for Hortense and among diners who appreciate what theyre getting. Watch a clip from the film ""Prisoners."" When Keller Dovers daughter and her friend go missing he takes matters into his own hands as the police pursue multiple leads. Starring Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. (Photo/Video Warner Bros.) Prisoners Theres a near-sacred history in Hollywood of non-U.S.- born directors providing fresh perspectives on America. Milos Forman. Alfred Hitchcock. Ang Lee. Ernst Lubitsch. Billy Wilder. For ""Prisoners"" a stress-inducing trip into child abduction the director is Quebecois filmmaker Denis Villeneuve who gives us an American ""hero"" guaranteed to push many buttons many times and who might not have been allowed to be quite so awful under a different directors lens. ENLARGE Jake Gyllenhaal Warner Bros. That character Keller Dover ( Hugh Jackman) is a building contractor survivalist and devout Christian who drives a pickup truck sings ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" in the shower and says an ""Our Father"" before helping his son shoot his first deer. He maintains a survivalists philosophy (""Pray for the best prepare for the worst"") and a basement full of canned goods. When catastrophe strikes he turns into a monster. In his new film ""Prisoners"" actor Hugh Jackman portrays a humble hardworking father whose daughter is suddenly abducted upending his carefully built life. The actor sat with the WSJs Barbara Chai to discuss ""Prisoners"" his future Broadway show ""Houdini"" and returning to the Wolverine in ""X-Men."" Read more at WSJ.com/Speakeasy Mr. Villeneuve leans heavily on ""Zodiac"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"" for his mood and on screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski for his nightmare story. While Keller and wife Grace ( Maria Bello) celebrate Thanksgiving with their neighbors Nancy and Franklin Birch (Viola Davis Terrence Howard) their young daughters go outside and immediately go missing. An RV had been parked outside; the older kids say there was someone in it. Panic ensues as does rain which under the circumstances--aberrant religion informs the entire story--seems vengeful and Old Testament. The local police are on the case right away chiefly the departments ace detective Loki ( Jake Gyllenhaal) who tracks down the camper arrests the driver Alex Jones ( Paul Dano) and decides hes got the wrong guy. Alex is too simple-minded to have abducted two preteen girls in broad daylight and hidden them away. Loki moves on. Keller cant. In addition to the skin-crawling camera moves and the understated dread that bolsters the surface tensions of ""Prisoners"" there is a fascinating actors duel going on. Mr. Jackman is all seething anger and righteous pain; his character clearly wants to be an avenging angel as he kidnaps Alex and tries to torture the truth out of him. Mr. Gyllenhaals performance is different. He internalizes Lokis evident problems which include an insubordinate contempt for his higher ups a supreme confidence in his own investigative judgment and the kind of control over his passions that is very deliberate and fragile. Mr. Jackman may well get awards. Mr. Gyllenhaal gets our attention. After Tiller Nothing has encapsulated the craziness of the so-called abortion ""debate"" than the murder--in church--of George Tiller by an antiabortion religious zealot. So it takes a bit of imagination to think that even a movie as sober and sobering as ""After Tiller"" will have much useful effect on an issue so seemingly immune to reason. Directed by Lana Wilson and Martha Shane ""Tiller"" addresses the issue of late-term abortion by sweeping aside rhetoric and hysterics providing valuable information (i.e. that such abortions account for less than 1% of the total in this country) and delivers a useful debunking of certain ideas including the notion that ending a pregnancy in the final trimester is something done casually as birth control or without enormous anguish on the part of both patient and doctor. ""It seems barbaric"" agrees Dr. Shelley Sella. ""Unless people understand whats going on with the woman its impossible to support."" ""After Tiller"" may not be an exhaustive study of the issue but it does provide some understanding. Rewind You Can Count on Me (2000) ENLARGE You Can Count on Me Directed by Kenneth Lonergan (""Margaret"") this bittersweet story of a drifter brother and his stalwart sister proved to be a breakout for both Mark Ruffalo and Laura Linney who earned her first Oscar nomination as a single mother in upstate New York juggling her son her brother and her miserable boss played with pitch-perfect petulance by Matthew Broderick. Once described as a film about ""beautiful losers"" it is just that and Mr. Lonergan and company make it all very memorable. Jon Tenney and Rory Culkin also appear. Mr. Lonergan wrote the screenplay. Senna (2010) ENLARGE Senna Director Asif Kapadias portrait of Brazilian Formula One legend Ayrton Senna--and his ugly rivalry with French driver Alain Prost--was the beneficiary of the ban against cigarette advertising on television Tobacco companies desperate for exposure starting channeling their ad money into racing sponsoring drivers pasting logos on everything that moved and filming every race with multiple cameras. Mr. Kapadia given unprecedented access to the Formula One archives was able to make a nonfiction film with the same kind of visual storytelling options available to a Hollywood director. The result One of the better documentaries on the theme. Zodiac (2007) ENLARGE Zodiac Jake Gyllenhall plays the obsessive rather than the detective--the cop is portrayed by Mark Ruffalo--in this highly atmospheric David Fincher thriller shot with characteristic moodiness by Harris Savides. Based on murders committed in the Bay Area during the 1960s and 70s by a murderer known as Zodiac it also stars Robert Downey Jr. who eats a bit of scenery as the reporter assigned to the case but is as fascinating to watch as Mr. Gyllenhaal who is driven from boyish to bonkers by a serial killer with a flair for the dramatic.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In 1976 Formula One superstars James Hunt and Niki Lauda battle for world supremacy. Rated R BOTTOM LINE Plenty of speed and volume but what really drives this movie are the fine performances from Hemsworth and Bruhl as personalities clashing on and off the track. CAST Chris Hemsworth Daniel Bruhl Olivia Wilde LENGTH 203 Engines roar at deafening volume in ""Rush"" Ron Howards high-octane movie about Formula One racing legends dueling for domination in the mid-1970s. At its heart though ""Rush"" is a thoughtful story about two smaller much slower creatures the grasshopper and the ant. Remember them from Aesops fable? In this version the carefree grasshopper is James Hunt a British playboy slopping over with raw talent and charisma but lacking in the discipline department. Played to perfection by a golden-haired Chris Hemsworth (""Thor"") Hunt is the embodiment of the high-shag 70s a European dreamboat whose blue eyes and deep-V shirts mesmerize every stewardess nurse and model in his path. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Hunts polar opposite the hardworking ant is Niki Lauda a mirthless methodical Austrian played with intensity and sly humor by Daniel Bruhl a relatively new Spanish-German actor who was in ""Inglourious Basterds."" Thanks to Bruhl Laudas utter soullessness becomes the films most dependably funny gag. ""Happiness is the enemy"" he tells his wife on their honeymoon. In another movie either of these men -- the arrogant hunk the frozen robot -- might have been our villain. But screenwriter Peter Morgan (""Frost/Nixon"") has a deeper insight. Hunt is more of a Tom Cruise type a cocky kid heading for a hard lesson. Lauda provides it by becoming world champion. Competing against Hunt during a neck-and-neck season in 1976 Lauda survives a horrific accident and returns -- still bleeding from surgery -- to compete in the final race at Japans Fuji Speedway. It turns out these archrivals are both heroes. (Helping shade in the characters are Olivia Wilde and Alexandra Maria Lara as their very different wives.) The movies racing scenes can feel hollow. Howard tries to build excitement with impossible close-ups inside combusting engines but these add visual flair not visceral impact. ""Rush"" is most interesting when its off the track and asking a fairly profound question Which is the right way to live? Aesop came down firmly in favor of the ant but ""Rush"" has a more thought-provoking answer. 234 MediaRush trailer PLOT In 1976 Formula One superstars James Hunt and Niki Lauda battle for world supremacy. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING R CAST Chris Hemsworth Daniel Bruhl Olivia Wilde LENGTH 203 BOTTOM LINE Plenty of speed and volume but what really drives this movie are the fine performances from Hemsworth and Bruhl as personalities clashing on and off the track.

Theres plenty of cornpone alongside the racetrack curves in ""Rush"" but this is tremendously exciting cinema - shot by the boundary-pushing Anthony Dod Mantle - as well as old-school escapist drama with ample eye candy for viewers of all persuasions. Howard has a mixed critical reputation (to put it kindly) but is best understood as a professional craftsman who rises and falls with his material. His films as a director range from riveting (""Apollo 13"") to dreadful (""Angels amp; Demons"") and its not coincidental that ""Rush"" reunites him with British playwright and screenwriter Peter Morgan who also wrote ""Frost/Nixon"" Howards last good movie. (Morgans other screenplays include ""The Queen"" ""The Last King of Scotland"" and the underappreciated ""The Damned United"" perhaps the best British soccer film.)Morgan and Howard got hold of a true-life sporting saga that filmmakers have slobbered over for decades the dramatic story of the 1976 Formula One racing season and the fierce rivalry between English playboy James Hunt (played by Aussie heartthrob Chris Hemsworth Thor in the Marvel Comics movies) and Austrian tactical genius Niki Lauda (German actor Daniel Bruhl in his first major Hollywood role). Ive seen Bruhl in several German-language films and Im not surprised that hes perfect as the monomaniacal Lauda but Hemsworth is the revelation here. Hes charismatic and funny not to mention physically impressive but also brings some depth to a character who could have been cartoonish hinting at the real-life Hunts uncertainty and unhappiness. It seems peculiar to issue a spoiler alert for a movie based on well-known events but most of the potential audience for ""Rush"" either wont remember the Hunt-Lauda clash or werent interested at the time. I cant avoid some discussion of what actually happened but Ill try to keep it general.Those were years of maximum glamour and maximum danger in European motor racing when many drivers partied deep into the night and one or two were killed or severely injured almost every season. The whole scene resembled a Helmut Newton photo shoot with the drugs vintage Champagne and long-legged models to match and Hunt a long-haired pretty boy with an aristocratic background and an upper-crust accent was its poster child. In some respects the Hunt-Lauda rivalry of the 70s prefigured the one two decades later between Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna with the latters death during an Italian race in 1994 bringing down the curtain on that whole era. (If you havent seen Asif Kapadias terrific documentary ""Senna"" youre missing out and it doesnt matter whether you know the first thing about auto racing.)While Morgans screenplay sticks pretty close to the most fact-checkable elements of the Hunt-Lauda story meaning details about when and where they raced and who won a decision has clearly been made to ramp up the differences between them for dramatic effect. Theres no denying that they had divergent styles on the racetrack where Lauda was a merciless and calculating tactician and Hunt was a reckless daredevil famous for his crashes. While Lauda was a diminutive racing nerd with a pronounced overbite (often nicknamed ""the Rat"") who spent most of his career married and monogamous Hunt was a legendary womanizer with a succession of tabloid-friendly relationships. His model wife Suzy played by Olivia Wilde in the film left him in 1975 for Richard Burton who reportedly paid 1 million to fund the couples divorce. But Lauda has said in recent interviews that he and Hunt always respected each other and were good friends off the track which isnt what you see in the film. It also sounds as if Lauda wasnt always a monk; he remembers crashing in Hunts London apartment once or twice joined by a couple of late-night companions.Those Hollywood simplifications rankle a bit as does the way ""Rush"" skims over Hunts lifelong battles with fear anger anxiety and depression. (The girls the drugs and the booze not to mention the death-defying occupation may have been his means of self-medication.) But even in this glossied-up version watching Hemsworth and Bruhl bicker on and off the track and white-knuckling along with Mantles supercool race photography -- were attached to the wheel Were in the grass Were looking through the drivers smeared visor -- is so much fun you wont be worried about biblical accuracy. Howard apparently knew almost nothing about Formula One racing going into ""Rush"" and I would say the amount of explanatory material (including judicious snippets of real racing footage) is just about right. You Might Also Like Although ""Rush"" compresses the timeframe somewhat it makes clear that Lauda and Hunt had known each other since they began racing in lower divisions in the mid-1960s and that by the mid-70s they were brash newcomers in Formula One who had arrived by unconventional means. Both started out with wealthy backers who bought them Formula One ""drives"" - Christian McKay has a nice supporting role as the eccentric Lord Hesketh who bankrupted himself behind Hunt - and both were seen as interlopers. Lauda used his mechanical ingenuity and ferocious drive to leverage himself onto the Ferrari team - the New York Yankees or Manchester United of motor sports - and rapidly blew past veteran Ferrari driver Clay Regazzoni (Pierfrancesco Favino) winning the Spanish and Dutch Grand Prix races on his first year with the team and seven more races and a runaway world championship in his second year which was 1975.That set up the big 1976 showdown with Hunt who got a last-minute ""drive"" with the prestigious McLaren team after Lord Hesketh pulled out on the premise that he was the only driver good enough to stop Lauda and Ferrari from repeating as champion. How that all played out in a legendary contest that featured one of them nearly dying on the track a courageous comeback that abruptly shifted the public perception of both men and one of the closest finishes in Formula One history is the stuff of legend. Were nearly done here but if you really dont want to know what happened now would be the time to go click on something else.There was so much soap opera in that 1976 season that Morgan and Howard have to pick and choose which may frustrate fanatics like me but probably makes for a cleaner motion-picture entertainment. They focus considerable attention on the technical protest lodged by Lauda that temporarily cost Hunt his victory in the Spanish Grand Prix and could have scuttled his entire season but never mention that Hunt was actually stripped of a victory in Britain a few weeks later for an entirely different rules violation. But as any racing fan of that era will remember the pivotal event of the 1976 season - and the dramatic centerpiece of this movie - was Laudas near-fatal fiery crash at the Nurbringring in Germany on Aug. 1. Maniacally determined to beat Hunt Lauda returned to racing (against medical advice) just six weeks after being given last rites in the hospital with his mutilated face covered with scar tissue and hastily completed skin grafts. (For reasons of his own Lauda who is now in his 60s has never had more extensive reconstructive surgery.) Theres no way to categorize that except as a form of madness and while the quest to become the best person in the world at driving in circles may seem like an especially idiotic form of madness its arguably no more pointless than most other forms of human competition. Again one feels the limitations of Hollywood cinema in ""Rush"" in that theres so much more to say about the aftermath of that 1976 season and about both mens attitudes toward life and death than this picture can manage. This is the best and most exciting auto-racing movie for years if not decades which doesnt stop me from wishing it were better or its epilogue more satisfying. I can tell you that Niki Lauda won two more world championships after his accident and has had a successful business career since retirement. It was Hunt oddly enough who never seemed to get past the trauma and drama of 76 drifting away from the sport and dying of a heart attack at age 45. He died young and stayed pretty while Lauda is still alive with a face (as he puts it) that scares people. I dont know what to think about that honestly; it all depends on your point of view.

"Review Rush is a good ride but not a great one - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Rush is a good ride but not a great one Rush Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews Rush starring Chris Hemsworth Daniel Bruhl Alexandra Maria Lara Olivia Wilde. Kenneth Turan reviews Rush starring Chris Hemsworth Daniel Bruhl Alexandra Maria Lara Olivia Wilde. Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic If the elegant cars of Formula One racing are thoroughbreds ""Rush"" the new film set in that world is more of a mixed breed. When screenwriter Peter Morgan candidly calls this ""a British independent film directed by a Hollywood director"" he is underlining the movies frustrations as well as its strengths.That director would be Ron Howard who brought his usual brand of crack professionalism to this re-creation of the real life mid-1970s rivalry between drivers Niki Lauda of Austria and Britains James Hunt as they both strove for the Formula One championship. Howard has been especially on target with his choice of actors. Both Chris ""Thor"" Hemsworth as Hunt and the versatile Daniel Bruhl taking on Lauda after projects ranging from ""Good Bye Lenin"" to ""Inglourious Basterds"" completely inhabit their characters.PHOTOS Movie Sneaks 2013 The motor of this drama is not just that each of these men is obsessively driven to win the racing title. Its also that they view life so completely differently they cant help but get on each others nerves in a very major way.Hunt had as much raw talent as any driver of his generation but as Morgans script has him admit ""I have a hot head and an inability to tolerate discipline."" What he does tolerate remarkably well is lots and lots of sex drugs and alcohol not necessarily in that order.Lauda in contrast is a superb technician an obsessive who knows more about his cars than his mechanics do and he begrudges every second he spends away from the track. Unlike the charismatic Hunt he has zero gift for people and a tendency to insult folks without even knowing hes done so.""Rush"" begins on Aug. 1 1976 the ominous rainy morning of the German Grand Prix with Lauda saying in voiceover ""I am known for two things one is my rivalry with James Hunt and the other is this race."" Before we find out what happens on that day and its disturbing aftermath ""Rush"" flashes back to both mens start in racing their relationship with women and the roots of their palpable distaste for each other.PHOTOS Celebrities by The TimesHemsworth is casually convincing as a man so physically attractive that an emergency room nurse is willing to endanger his health by taking him to bed when he needs medical attention. When Hunt does finally get married to top model Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde as a blond) it is completely on a whim.Lauda who calculates the risk in everything has a less impulsive courtship of Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara) though it does start with one of the films most pleasing scenes a hitchhiking episode that offers a reverse twist on the celebrated Clark Gable/Claudette Colbert moment in ""It Happened One Night.""In a sane world there would be nothing remotely risky about making a film about rivals who enjoy taunting each other Hunt mocks Lauda as ""a good little boy"" and the Austrian returns the compliment saying he wished his counterpart was ""half as impressive inside as outside.""In todays franchise-driven marketplace however whats known in the business as mid-range pictures are getting increasingly difficult to finance even ones written by a man twice nominated for a screenwriting Oscar (""The Queen"" ""Frost/Nixon"").And though Universal Pictures has been home to Howard and producing partner Brian Grazer for decades (and the studio ended up with the distribution deal) the director had to seek production money elsewhere for this project. That ""Rush"" got made at all is a happy ending but its difficult to resist the sense that it could have been happier.PHOTOS Hollywood backlot momentsOn the one hand it is satisfying seeing Howard expertly handling a piece of adult mass entertainment. Hes forged a team combining ""Slumdog Millionaire"" veterans like fluid cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle and production designer Mark Digby with his own regular editors Dan Hanley and Mike Hill and veteran composer Hans Zimmer. Together they make the lure and excitement of fast machines palpable on screen.Howard has made some smart adult pictures including ""Frost/Nixon"" and the perennially underappreciated western ""The Missing"" but that touch has eluded him here. Its hard to fight the feeling that his sensibility is in some fundamental way at odds with the story Morgans script wants to tell.For all his skill Howards on-screen instincts are inescapably square. Its not that he avoids the inevitable R-rated sex and drug scenes or even adult themes like the multiple dimensions the bad and the good sides of rivalry. Its that his polished Hollywood style is not ideally suited to the edginess this story seems to cry out for.Unlike the charismatic Formula One racer Ayrton Senna -- the subject of Asif Kapadias superb 2010 documentary ""Senna"" -- both Hunt and Lauda are extremely arrogant albeit in diametrically opposite ways. One has too much personality the other has too little and so the film has difficulty getting us to care about either one of them. Despite its strengths the telling of this counterintuitive tale about the mysterious ways cutthroat competition can enrich lives never manages to be completely convincing. Though one enjoys and appreciates ""Rush"" for what it is it does not thrill the blood the way we have the right to expect a film like this to do.Rush MPAA rating R for sexual content nudity language some disturbing images and brief drug useRunning time 2 hours 3 minutesPlaying In limited release in New York and L.A..

Rated R (profanity nudity sexual content gore drug use). At the Lincoln Square and the Union Square. Im not a car guy. To me ""automobile"" equals ""fuel-efficient metal transportation box with many airbags preferably driven by my wife."" When were told in Ron Howards ""Rush"" that in 1970s Formula One racing two of the best 25 drivers would perish every year the word that flashed in my head was not ""courage."" Its not like these drivers are in it for the promise of saving a life or changing the world or planting a flag in an unknown land. No as one racer puts it in ""Rush"" its pretty much ""driving around and around in circles. Its pathetic. ""When I see a driver roasting to death in his flaming machine I tend to wonder if his last thoughts are ""I did this for a trophy?"" ""Rush"" though it will win no trophies is fine filmmaking a smart visually engorged frequently thrilling tale of boyish competition -- inspired by a true story. At heart its ""Amadeus"" on wheels only this time Salieri is the Austrian. His driver Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl of ""Inglourious Basterds"") the frowny grind who goes to bed early and gets married at city hall shortly after telling his bride ""If Im going to do this with anyone it might as well be you."" Tell him he looks like a rat and he defends rats ""very intelligent and they have a strong survival instinct."" His archrival the clown genius and Sun God of this alleged sport is James Hunt a blond British Mozart of the motorheads who refuses to take racing cars seriously. His uniform patch reads ""Sex Breakfast of Champions"" and he bonks stewardesses while still on the plane. Hes played by Chris Hemsworth who demonstrates true star power in this role Picture a young Brad Pitt with the prairie-simpleton aspect replaced by James Bonds sense of humor. Chris Hemsworth portrays legendary British Formula One racer James Hunt in ""Rush.""Photo AP Compared to him Lauda gets to looking like Billy Crystal wearing a hockey mask (in other words present-day Billy Crystal) as the two compete to be the best Grand Prix racer in Europe in 1976 a moment when the worlds fastest cars were even louder than the mens sports jackets. Howard gets some motor oil under his nails has some fun. Hes loose. The racing scenes are roaring good fun the colors are saturated the camera work is a bit messy. Plus there are lines of cocaine and swearing and bare breasts. Its sweet to think that Howard at least in the early going identifies with Hunt his Formula One Fonzie. Because Howard of course makes laudable polished soundly structured and easily digestible movies that you need only see once. ""Ron Howard is my favorite director"" said no one ever. Howard has been working hard since he was 4 but has never once been kissed by genius. Meanwhile the Quentin Tarantinos and the Paul Thomas Andersons whoosh by with scarves billowing in the wind genius giving them lap dances. Howard cant help signaling where hes going; if theres a shot of a part coming loose the car is about to crash. Announcers keep saying things that pictures alone should tell us. Its like Howard went to those public-speaking seminars where they teach ""Tell em what youre gonna tell em tell em tell em what you just told em."" When Laudas girl says hes all wrong about her car needing a tune-up you know that three seconds later Howard is going to cut to the car smoking by the side of the road. It isnt so surprising then that Howards sympathies turn to Lauda in the second half. Arent guts nobler than gifts? Maybe but This is a movie. We love stars who turn us on and make us laugh and the less space there is for Hunt (colorful even in catastrophe he loses his model girlfriend played by Olivia Wilde to Richard Burton) the more routine the film becomes. Stakes also are a problem There is apparently no Wimbledon or World Series of racing. Instead theres a complicated points-added system. One of the drivers isnt even present for the last race. What kind of sports movie peaks with only one competitor on the field? To clear that up screenwriter Peter Morgan (""The Queen"") adds a somewhat awkward coda The movie announces a little too straightforwardly that what it has really been about is . . . friendship. Yet never do the two boys seem to really hate each other. Which is how you know they dont love each other.

Its also an ode to joyous rivalry.Though based on a true story this is no by-the-book biopic. Nor is it a cliched sports movie about the triumph of the human spirit. Rush is a thrilling action film and a moving tale of an adversarial friendship a kind of anti-bromance that is as captivating as any love story.Director Ron Howard deftly maneuvers his camera and his storytelling to showcase the supercharged competition between the misanthropic Austrian Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) and hedonistic British playboy James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth).Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Rush tells the true story of Formula 1 champion driver Niki Lauda after he nearly dies in a car crash in 1976 and returns to race his rival James Hunt. VPCFor Hunt whose driving suit had a decal proclaiming ""Sex The Breakfast of Champions"" pleasure was as important as winning. When he wasnt racing he was cavorting with groupies (he has supposedly bedded more than 5000 women).Lauda was his polar opposite. Rigid and introverted he had no use for socializing and his abrasive manner was off-putting to many.Though they had complicated personalities the pair developed a grudging respect even as they taunted each other. Their relationship plays out against the riveting 1976 season during the run-up to the world championship.This is Howards best film with a perfectly calibrated screenplay by Peter Morgan author of The Queen and a master of character studies. (Howard and Morgan also teamed on 2008s Frost/Nixon). Factor in the finely tuned performances by Bruhl (he should be remembered come Oscar time) and Hemsworth and the result is a winning formula.VIDEO Hemsworth Wilde Rush to premiereREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersHemsworths blond good looks are ideally suited to the role. He nails Hunts insouciant charisma. But the brash Hunt takes an instant dislike to the caustic Lauda.And the distaste is mutual Lauda regards Hunt as an undisciplined womanizer. Hunt marries model Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde) and the marriage quickly dissolves. Lauda marries Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara) who staunchly stands by him resigned to playing second fiddle to Laudas passion for racing.But the romantic partners are relegated to supporting status here. This is a story of two men who clash and push each other to do their best.Howard unflinchingly depicts a devastating turn of events that transformed Laudas life. We come to regard Lauda in a more endearing light and admire his tenacity. At the same time we see the decency beneath Hunts swagger. Still Howard doesnt shy away from depicting their respective flaws.Rushs racing scenes where accidents and death loom are the most enthralling action sequences of any movie this year. The considerable talents of the storytellers and the two astonishing lead performances make it a tale with wide appeal. 258 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1a7V4NpFall Movies Calendar SeptemberTake a look at the films heading to the box office this September.

(Jaap Buitendijk) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Saturday September 21 2013 724 PM Title Rush Film Info R Language sexuality peril. Area theaters. Racecar driving is one of the most cinematic sports. The drivers are an eccentric bunch and the 1970s was a colorful era. But it takes a few laps for Ron Howards ""Rush"" to find an opening into its fact-based story. When it does though the movie cruises to an ending thats gripping whether you know the outcome or not. In 1976 British driver James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) is a flashy entitled young superstar in need of self-discipline if hes to move into Formula One. When he finally does he has a posh sponsor in McLaren a sleek new car waiting for him a sexy girlfriend who shows up on cue -- and fairly quickly a racing rival -- Niki Lauda. Calm before the storm James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth l.) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) are Formula One rivals in ""Rush."" (Jaap Buitendijk) Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) is an Austrian and like Hunt a spoiled son of money dreaming of an exciting life 180 degrees from what his family expects of him. Lauda however is missing a certain glamorous side; described as ""rat-like"" by Hunt and known for his tenacious manner Lauda doesnt try to charm the media the way his competitors do but he still has the same urge to win. A more crucial difference is Laudas more analytical assessment of risk a then-rare degree of levelheadedness behind the wheel. ""It takes more than being quick"" to cross the finish line first Lauda says. ""Its the big picture."" Blonds who bond James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) weds model Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde) in ""Rush."" (Jaap Buitendijk) Howard tries to capture that big picture in a successful stylistically savvy pastiche of 70s flashiness. Amid all the glitz Hunt and the British model Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde) marry then quickly fall apart due to Hunts single-minded pursuit of the Formula One championship (Miller goes on to date actor Richard Burton). Lauda serves as fuel for Hunts determination -- and an obstacle to his plans. Then tragedy occurs in a fiery horror that has an unforeseen still surprising aftermath. As Hunt Hemsworth (to be seen again in ""Thor The Dark World"") has the golden-locked glow of a born winner. Fortunately he doesnt need to embody much more than the light and dark sides of that. Bruhl (coming soon in ""The Fifth Estate"") dances on the edge of Continental cartoonishness which was Lauda in 1976. He and Hunt -- whose connection the film shows was more crankily cordial than vicious -- filled roles preordained by their bigger-than-life sport. Hemsworth and Bruhl serve a similar purpose in a Peter Morgan script that only glances at subtlety. A real corker James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) celebrates a win in ""Rush."" (Jaap Buitendijk) Howard whose previous tales of men in professional peril include the topnotch ""Apollo 13"" as well as ""Backdraft"" and ""Cinderella Man"" works with cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle to create a style in the racing scenes that makes the most of every angle. By the time the final lap of ""Rush"" starts were up for the ride. jneumaiernydailynews.com Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" throughout the day Thurs.-Sun on New Yorks WOR 710-Am and at wor710.com.

Scratching an itch this Formula One drama has a lot going for it at the starting line a real-life 1976 rivalry between magnetic competitors James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl); a burnished beer-commercial glow courtesy of inspired cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle; and the director of the original Grand Theft Auto Ron Howard. Hunt a playboy and Lauda severe and calibrated make for obvious friction Rushs coleads could have used a few more moments of quiet intensity--theyre saddled with constantly delivering theses on the quest for victory--yet neither one embarrasses himself. But somethings gone horribly wrong on the track and not just the expected fiery spinouts. The plot lacks the grease-stained poetry of better gearhead clashes (such as the extraordinary 2010 documentary Senna); cynically Rush seems to be courting a video-game crowd impatient for another CGI-heavy Fast amp; Furious. Howards hottest point of contact comes at a press conference where the physically mangled Lauda spits invective at a journalist asking about the state of his marriage. A more daring filmmaker would have probed Laudas sacrifice in a quieter follow-up scene. Instead the movie leans on symbolic imagery thats alternately tired and ridiculous Hunts impatiently flicked cigarette lighter (yes hes a candle waiting to be lit) or a black-widow spider crawling up the stands of one particularly dangerous course. These are classic frenemies; their tale deserves more gas in the tank.

The balance is poetic in every form the balance between the two protagonists but even more so the balance in sequences of the two. You never get bored watching and just when youre about to get bored it switches brilliantly. The story is for me one of the strongest points and one of the best sports film stories ever. But thats just the plot and the balance and pacing; the achievement in cinematography is just stunning. Engines being fired ultra zoomed cameras attached to the cars gear where you see every little thing moving rain falling in slow-motion... everything is so so beautiful. But thats just graphically the sound is so deep so real it reels you in and echoes afterwards. In combination with the music just brilliant. But thats just the cinematography the actors deliver an astonishing performance; you hate them both but you wish them both the best they should both win. Hemsworth is truly arrogant and believable Bruhl is truly driven and professional. The chemistry although I hate that word is just spot on.

One of those guys was English racing driver James Hunt the charismatic rapscallion who won that years Formula One World Championship--the embroidered badge on his driving suit read ""Sex the Breakfast of Champions."" His nemesis Austrian-born Niki Lauda was something else again a straight arrow with square hair and equally rigid rules about how exactly one ought to put the pedal to the metal. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Lauda had won the championship in 1975 and had every reason to think he could do so again. What happened when he faced Hunt during the 1976 season surprised horrified and ultimately amazed everyone who followed the sport. That championship year is the subject of Rush which pulls off a mini-miracle itself Its both a perceptive dual character study and that rarity of rarities a large-scale action movie for grown-ups one worth leaving the house for.Its also the last thing you might expect from Ron Howard a director whos made some terrific films (Splash Frost/Nixon) but whose earnestness and dutiful workmanlike approach has also resulted in prestige snoozers like Apollo 13. Then again this is the guy who made his directing debut with Grand Theft Auto for schlock impresario Roger Corman and Rush seems to have shaken something awake in him. If the storytelling sometimes feels a bit scrambled--Howard tries to pack a lot maybe too much into 123 surprisingly fleet minutes--the racing sequences make up for it. Rush is flawed but alive and its actors never get lost in the blur of speed. If the movie is partly about machines--a flimsy type of race car that Hunt calls ""just a little coffin really""--its just as much about men who know precisely what to do in those split seconds when theres no time to blink let alone think.Film DetailsCritics Pick Rush RatingR GenreAction/Adventure Running Time123 More Info Trailer Chris Hemsworth of Thor fame plays Hunt and you can see why the driver is a national treasure even in a country thats almost embarrassed to have national treasures. Hunt is Englands version of California blond insouciant and randy. He loves the ladies almost as much as he loves driving--early in Rush he stands before a gaggle of goggle-eyed nurses and introduces himself 007-style as ""Hunt. James Hunt."" But the person who really gets under his skin is Lauda played by Daniel Bruhl. The two meet very uncute. They each walk away from their first and every subsequent encounter muttering ""asshole.""But Lauda and Hunt are always there for each other sometimes more so than for the women in their lives. (Olivia Wilde plays Hunts wife the model Suzy Miller who left him for Richard Burton after his indifference toward her became unbearable; the stunning Romanian-born actress Alexandra Maria Lara plays Laudas loyal partner Marlene though the womenfolk are pretty much relegated to the backseat here.) Lauda and Hunt growl and spar but they also urge one another on understanding each other better than anyone else ever could. At one point Hunt explains in voiceover ""The closer you are to death the more alive you feel"" a sentiment brought home to Lauda the hard way. In case you dont know the story I wont divulge the details here but Howard working from a script by Peter Morgan dramatizes the event that changed Laudas life in a way thats horrifying and direct; he hits a pitch of fiery claustrophobic intensity thats hard to shake.Hemsworths Hunt is rakish and undeniably adorable. Hes the one you want to look at but Bruhl is the one you want to watch. His Lauda is at first deeply unlikable and uncharismatic a glowering gnat. But he knows himself and his limitations intimately in a way that Hunt doesnt and Bruhl plays that confidence as an alternative kind of sex appeal. Lauda is a hard-ass and a grind assertive to the point of cockiness but you root for him. In a line of work where time means everything he doesnt have a minute to spare for idiots.Hunt died of a heart attack at age 45; Lauda is alive today. Rush is a fuel-injected valentine to them both a love letter written with cursive sweeps of movement and grand whooshes of sound. The racing sequences as shot by cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle and edited by Daniel P. Hanley and Mike Hill are fleet exhilarating stunning in their detail At one point the flagman at the finish line leaps into the air bringing his flag down with a flourish before being blown back by the force of the car passing him. The moment is over in a flash a treasure barely captured. I have an ailing 17-year-old cat who creeps toward the TV fascinated whenever any of the Transporter movies or a random NASCAR race pops up on the screen during his humans channel surfing. His love of fast cars surpasses that of any man I know. I hope he can make it until Rush comes out on DVD. But anyone who can get to the theater on two legs or four wheels should see it on the big screen.Follow VoiceFilmClub Subscribe to the Voice Film Club podcast Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Stephanie Zacharek Follow szacharek Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Biopic Toronto Winners and Losers From a Very Good Year Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl play real-life rivals in a thrilling sports tale thats set -- and looks like it was shot -- in the 1970s ""Sexy"" and ""stylish"" are not the adjectives that usually come to mind when describing the blandly middlebrow output of director Ron Howard. But whether its the racing cars (Howards debut effort was after all ""Grand Theft Auto"") or the real-life daredevil drivers whose stories hes telling ""Rush"" finds the filmmaker at his most electrifying. Youd have to go back to ""Apollo 13"" or even ""Splash"" to find Howards filmmaking instincts pardon the expression firing on all cylinders the way they do here. Set in the glamorous and exceedingly dangerous world of Formula One racing ""Rush"" examines the rivalry between two of the sports giants James Hunt (played by Chris Hemsworth ""Thor"") of Great Britain and the Austrian-born Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl of ""Inglorious Basterds""). See Video Chris Hemsworth Doesnt Believe Death Applies to Race Car Drivers in New Rush Trailer Neck-and-neck rivals on the racetrack the two couldnt have been more different apart from the fact that both came from distinguished families that didnt support their racing dreams. Hunt drives recklessly and fearlessly while Lauda calculates the odds and manages the risks. Lauda has an overbite and a brusque personality (a great many of the films characters call him an a-hole at one point or other) while Hunt is sexy and charismatic. Their rivalry begins in Formula Three racing and continues as both climb the ladder into Formula One. Lauda subverts the usual means of ascent by essentially buying his way in and then making himself invaluable by knowing how to design great racing cars even insulting the handiwork of his eventual Ferrari sponsors to their face. Hunt follows suit first with a posh backer (Christian McKay as Alexander Hesketh) and later with U.K. car manufacturer McLaren -- per the films version of events Hunt all but begs the company for a second chance on the track mainly so he can face off with Lauda again. The men risk injury and personal loss as they devote themselves to being the best at what they do and by the time the two are facing off at the 1976 Japan Grand Prix for the world title they are in best sports-movie form competing not only against each other but also against themselves. Also read Thor The Dark World First Trailer Hits With a Boom (Video) Ron Howards last collaboration with screenwriter Peter Morgan was ""Frost/Nixon"" a movie with a bad habit of showing you and then telling you and sometimes even telling you again in case you missed it the first couple of times. With ""Rush"" however their storytelling has become much more streamlined and spare. Theres a minor bit of narration from both characters bookending the movie but for the most part the script never slows down to walk us through this world or to explain the characters motivations or to generate contrived drama. Scenes move along at a fast clip but they communicate everything that viewers will need to know to stay engaged. Underlining the point is kept to a minimum. The look of ""Rush"" is extraordinary from the frequent use of close-ups (which turn the big and noisy sport of auto racing into something intimate) to the filtered grainy cinematography that makes the movie appear as though it had been filmed in the mid-1970s when most of it takes place. Director of photography Anthony Dod Mantle (who already has one of 2013s best-shot films under his belt with ""Trance"") deserves the lions share of the credit but the period details are perfection thanks to the work of countless set dressers hair and makeup people and an army of digital wizards who no doubt had to erase satellite dishes and other contemporary anachronisms. Also read Harry Potter Actor in Negotiations for Ron Howards In the Heart of the Sea (Exclusive) The film belongs to Bruhl and Hemsworth but there are some choice moments for Alexandra Maria Lara (""The Reader"" ""Control"") and Olivia Wilde as Lauda and Hunts respective spouses. They too look like they just stepped out of 1975 but lucky for them and for us the movie offers some progressive gender politics both of these women understand their husbands need to cheat death on a regular basis and neither clutches a hanky and tearfully begs their man to stay home and find a less risky line of work. As for the male stars of ""Rush"" they recall the line about how Ginger Rogers gave Fred Astaire sex and he gave her class. Hemsworths matinee idol mug gets the prime placement on the U.S. poster and he opens the film with a naked romp through the apartment of a turned-on nurse who has just sewn up one of his wounds. If Bruhl doesnt give the movie class exactly he does give it a heart and a brain taking a character who races not for girls and glory but for the love of the sport and making him someone we care about and respect. Neither character is stricken with one-dimensionality however -- we get to see the vulnerability beneath Hunts bravado and the charm hidden with Laudas determination. The movie might have benefited from a tweak or two whether in tightening the pacing of the third act or dialing down Hans Zimmers overblown score a notch but overall ""Rush"" is an exhilarating surprise from a director whos been playing it safe for most of his career. Like his heroes he takes a risk and wins. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Dowd and Ben Kenigsberg Sep 7 2013 657 AM Share Tweet Share Tweet Theres no right or wrong way to attend a film festival but it seems fair to assert that any American who comes to TIFF to watch nothing but high-profile American movies is--to put it kindly--not getting their moneys worth. Then again sometimes a star-studded homegrown drama can be a nice festival palate cleanser especially when the rest of your day is spent grappling with smaller tougher more esoteric fare. The English-language debut of Denis Villeneuve who made the Oscar-nominated Incendies Prisoners (Grade B+) fits that bill nicely--though its not exactly a breezy genre distraction. Set in Pennsylvania during the investigation of a child-kidnapping case the film is conventional but almost nonstop gripping even after its plotting takes a turn for the slightly ludicrous. A sense of impending doom seeps into the opening shot in which an unsuspecting deer wanders into frame the camera pulling back slowly to reveal the teenage hunter--father by his side--moving the animal into the crosshairs of his riffle. As it turns out these two arent the only ones on the prowl. Hours later on the afternoon of a rainy Thanksgiving Day two grade-school girls disappear. One of them is the daughter of the man from the first scene a devout tough-love type played by Hugh Jackman seething with intensity. Maybe too much intensity actually Burying all traces of his Wolverine-worthy charisma the actor seems close to the edge from the start which makes his eventual descent into blinding bellowing rage less impactful. Better navigating a spectrum of emotions is Jake Gyllenhaal who plays the investigating officer--a local hotshot detective whos allegedly cracked every case hes been assigned. Gyllenhaal lends this archetypal character an amusing irritability; his exasperation is basically the lone source of levity in what turns out to be a pretty relentlessly grim thriller. Villeneuve crosscuts deftly between the efforts of his dueling protagonists men united in their aims but divided by their methods. The police eventually nab a suspect a mentally disabled man (Paul Dano) seen driving a suspicious van in the area but they dont have any evidence to keep him in custody. Consumed with paternal desperation Jackman takes matters into his own hands; the subsequent scenes are disturbing not just for the brutality of their violence but also for their allegorical power. (Jackman locks his silent captive in a cramped wooden box and slings a pillowcase over his head. Sound familiar?) Prisoners is concerned with the relationship between ends and means but not too deeply. Its predominately a crackerjack mystery yarn one that grows increasingly farfetched as it progresses but never quite loses its darkly magnetic pull. Working with the great cinematographer Roger Deakins who lends this ugly material a seductive sheen Villeneuve takes a heavy step into David Fincher territory There are shades of Zodiac in the gorgeous nighttime photography and obsessive procedure and of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo in the implausible plotting. Prisoners also recalls the bleak crime dramas of Bong Jo-Hoon (Memories Of Murder Mother) though it could have used a little more of those films ambiguity. In any case the crowd I watched it with sat in awed tense silence throughout--a mighty good sign that a thriller is doing its job. I might have to make room in my schedule for Enemy another film directed by Villeneuve starring Gyllenhaal and showing at TIFF this year. A half hour after Prisoners let out I ducked into a late screening of a very different movie and experienced an almost polar-opposite reaction from the audience. MANAKAMANA (Grade B) a repetitive but sometimes beguiling documentary produced by the directors of Leviathan inspired waves of walk-outs. The impatience was somewhat understandable A Wavelength selection screening in the less avant-friendly environs of the Lightbox MANAKAMANA requires total submission to its conceptual methodology. Filmmakers Stephanie Spray and Pacho Velez mounted cameras inside the cable cars that provide access to the eponymous temple in Nepal. The entire film is a series of medium shots of the commuters--a father and son college girls women eating ice cream--as they travel up or down the mountain the breathtaking terrain framed behind them. Though one T-shirt-clad teen insists that the round-trip takes 17 minutes travel time seems to vary. Are the subjects aware of the camera? Some seem to deliberately avoid its lens others may be performing for it. (And all but a few seem genuinely unsettled by the loud mechanical grinding that occurs occasionally during the trip.) Time most likely is manipulated; though the directors create the illusion of an unbroken single shot each landing of the cable car provides a cover of darkness in which they can cut. Here and there MANAKAMANA settles on a disarming moment a married couple plainly unable to disguise its discontent a lovely musical interlude even a zoological punchline. But the film overstays its welcome; one too many times does that cable car begin its ascent or descent to the point where the last few fades to black start to feel likes teases. Still I found it less tedious than Closed Curtain (Grade B-) the latest act of defiance from convicted Iranian auteur Jafar Panahi whos still under house arrest and still banned from making movies (though apparently his legal situation has somehow changed in ways the picture doesnt address.) Like This Is Not A Film Closed Curtain takes place almost entirely within the directors home. Unlike that film it has a kind of loose fictional plot in which a writer (Kambuzia Partovi the films co-director) spars with a house intruder who comes to represent surrender/suicide. That may sound livelier than the film that was not a film but without the meta trickery of its predecessor Closed Curtain just begins to feel like a lesser (though more handsomely shot) variation. Its nice to see Panahi keeping busy of course especially given that the main drive of this one is his fear of not being able to work anymore. But the finished product feels a bit like a restless throwaway a film he made of compulsion to just make something. Someone somehow get this man out of captivity and back into the streets like the heroines of his great joyful Offside. --A.A. Dowd One of the drawbacks of film festivals is that movies come in freighted with expectations about how theyll ""perform."" Every film is either a Best Picture contender or a catastrophe--and once a label has been applied thats the end of the discussion. Despite Twitters best efforts its not likely that 12 Years A Slave (Grade B+) conquered the Oscars--or racism in America--in the course of a single screening. That kind of reaction is a disservice to the film Steve McQueen has actually made which is not simply ""about slavery"" but another in the directors portraits of self-denial. Like the fasting Bobby Sands in Hunger (2008) and the repressed sex addict Michael Fassbender played in Shame (2011) Chiwetel Ejiofors Solomon Northup--a real-life Saratoga New York man kidnapped and sold into slavery on whose 1853 memoir the film is based--is forced into a situation where reticence is the only option. Even telling his new ""owners"" he can read and write would put him in grave danger of being killed. Theres a Kafka-esque relentlessness to his ordeal as he wakes up from his abduction and is beaten when he protests that hes a free man. He has no access to the law. Even when seemingly good men swear to help him their word proves to be worthless. 12 Years A Slave becomes a story of survival and to some extent martyrdom in the sense that staying alive requires acquiescing to an unjust system. Solomon becomes a favored slave to a plantation owner (Benedict Cumberbatch) he considers to be a decent man ""under the circumstances""--a stance that earns him accusations from fellow slaves of showing sympathy for the devil. After hes sold to Fassbenders volatile taskmaster the film escalates even further in its violence and horror. McQueens long takes accentuate the brutality as when Solomon is nearly lynched but then left noosed even after being spared or when hes forced to perform a whipping that Fassbender is ashamed to do. A crucial late scene finds the protagonist slowly joining in with the singing of a spiritual his conversion to slave life complete. Marred by a few distracting cameos and an overwrought Hans Zimmer score that at least on first listen sounds almost identical to the Shame score this is nevertheless a powerful vividly rendered film with a depiction of slavery thats less expansive but more stark than that seen in the Boschian atmospherics of Richard Fleischers Mandingo (1975) or Tarantinos movie-ized Django Unchained (2012). Ejiofor and Fassbender give intensely physical performances; the latter looking a little Van Gogh-like is terrifying even when he drapes his arm around Ejiofor who balances his co-star with an exquisite reserve. Its unquestionably a film to be seen and argued over--but dont call it Oscar bait. Its better than that. Yesterday I also overheard someone claim that Daniel Bruhl would receive a nomination for Ron Howards Rush (Grade B-) the kind of remark that again betrays a profound lack of self-consciousness. The movie chronicling the 1970s rivalry between Britains James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Austrias Niki Lauda (Bruhl) will likely appeal mainly to diehard Formula One fans though it does document a dynamic contrast in athletic styles. Hunt is the playboy who lives for danger and instinct. Lauda on the other hand is relentlessly methodical; in a major scene he says hes reluctant to race if conditions give him higher than a precisely 20 percent chance that hell be killed. Despite a clumsy intermittent voiceover from Peter Morgans screenplay Rush is basically a foursquare sports film enlivened by whiplash-inducing crisply edited racing sequences but otherwise pretty ordinary--certainly not on par with the more grandly scaled craftsmanship in Howards Cinderella Man. Howard isnt the only director here to be overshadowed by his past work. Kiyoshi ""no relation to Akira"" Kurosawa can be a first-rate horror filmmaker (1997s Cure) but his Real (Grade C) is an unsatisfying shamelessly derivative mix of elements from Inception Flatliners and Shutter Island. The movie starts promisingly as a man (Takeru Sato) makes a technology-abetted incursion into the mind of his comatose lover (Haruka Ayase) a manga artist who apparently attempted suicide after experiencing profound writers block. While the first half boasts some creepy images and the kind of pervading dread that marked both Cure and Kurosawas Pulse (2001) the further the film travels into its characters pasts the more it falls back on blunt Freudianism and risible metaphysics. Tims Vermeer (Grade B-) puts forth an intriguing idea that Vermeer in a secret method painted by using a camera obscura combined with a mirror as a guide. Its a technique anyone can use that essentially qualifies the artists paintings as proto-photographs. This Penn amp; Teller production (Teller takes directing credit; Penn appears as a talking head) follows San Antonio-based technologist Tim Jenison as he sets out to test his theory by painting his own version of a Vermeer using only tools the painter had at the time. Its a cool hypothesis catnip for art-history buffs but it cant quite sustain feature length. Lastly Im going to have plead ""grade pending"" on this years Locarno winner The Story Of My Death whose final 15 minutes I missed due to some last-minute schedule reshuffling. But on the basis of the two-hours-plus I saw Albert Serras imagined meeting of the minds between Casanova and Dracula--the latter doesnt appear until past the halfway mark--is as verbose and self-serious and as his biblical riff Birdsong (2008) and his Don Quixote story Honor Of The Knights (2006) were laconic and wry. --Ben Kenigsberg Share Tweet Filed Under More Toronto International Film Festival Previous Toronto International Film Festival Toronto 2013 Day One A Julian Assange biopic is no match for a Frederick Wiseman triumph Next Toronto International Film Festival Toronto 2013 Day Three Gravity drops Dont miss a story--follow The A.V.

As first impressions go it did not signal the second coming of Orson Welles. But the freckle-faced former Happy Days star radiated an infectious delight in smashing as many roaring muscle cars as he could get away with. Since then of course Howard has become one of Hollywoods most consistent and respected filmmakers crafting well-made crowd-pleasers that tackle more highbrow subjects. But judging from his white-knuckle new film Rush he hasnt outgrown his youthful sweet tooth for four-wheeled mayhem. He still has hot rods and the death-defying men who drive them on his mind. Based on the real-life rivalry between Formula One racing legends James Hunt and Niki Lauda Rush is a tale of two opposite personalities eyeing the same checkered-flag goal winning the 1976 world championship. Chris Hemsworth draws the flashier role in Hunt a fast-burning British bad boy with flowing blond locks silk shirts unbuttoned to his navel and a rakish playboy swagger. On and off the track hes wild cocky and undisciplined -- a deadly combination when youre strapped into a coffin on wheels going 170 miles an hour. ""The closer you are to death the more alive you feel"" Hemsworths Hunt says. And its thanks to the Thor stars champagne-spraying charisma that he makes risking your neck look like the coolest job on the planet. As Lauda Inglourious Basterds Daniel Bruhl buries his boyish good looks behind ratlike prosthetic teeth. With his clipped Austrian accent everything that comes out of his mouth sounds like a brusque insult. And it usually is. He may not be a particularly likable fellow but hes a methodical grinder with the unshakable conviction of someone whos calculated the odds on what it takes to win. Pitted against each other theyre like Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. Its not just about beating the other guy its about humiliating him in the process. Howards film is at its best when the rubber meets the road. Rush traces the thrilling neck-and-neck 1976 season from start to finish hopscotching from Brazil to Monaco to Japan. Even though the film hurtles from one exotic locale to the next the speedway sequences never feel repetitive -- and they never let up on the gas. More than in any racing movie since 1966s Grand Prix the action scenes capture the daredevil kick of sitting in the cramped claustrophobic cockpit of a Ferrari zipping around hairpin turns as tires squeal and engines roar. Things arent quite as thrilling off the track. When theyre not putting the pedal to the metal Lauda and Hunt are painted as broad archetypes -- the bad and the beautiful. It doesnt help that both men are given a perfunctory love interest (Olivia Wilde for Hemsworth and Alexandra Maria Lara for Bruhl) neither of whom feels fleshed out or is given much to do other than look worried. Theyre as much spectators as the fans in the stands. Its only in the last third of the film that Hunt and Lauda become flesh-and-blood human beings instead of videogame avatars. Jockeying with each other to become the leader in the standings the two men arrive at Germanys Nurburgring track where drizzly conditions prove why the harrowing course is called the Graveyard. Lauda ahead in points argues that its too dangerous to race and that the event should be canceled while Hunt uses his back-slapping charm to get the other drivers to vote Lauda down. Naturally disaster follows as Lauda barely able to see through his rain-soaked visor crashes in a grisly fireball horrifically burning his face and lungs. As he struggles to recover in the hospital Hunt closes in on first place which in turn fuels his enemy to rehabilitate faster and return to battle. The thought of a man covered in monstrous third-degree scars wincing in agony as he pulls his racing helmet over his head so that he can get back behind the wheel may sound insane. But as both Howard and millions of racing fans around the world know its also compelling human drama. Rush hits a few potholes but in the end it reveals the psyches of two men who only feel alive when theyre cheating death.

That and the feeling that youve been scraping your nose along rainy rubber-stained asphalt for almost two hours. Last time Howard made a sports movie it was the underpowered boxing film Cinderella Man. But Rush has on its team British screenwriter Peter Morgan - who also wrote Howards Frost/Nixon another head-to-head tale set in the 1970s. Here the sparring partners are champagne-swilling British racing driver James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) a stern Austrian. Part of the fun of Rush is how it takes us back to a pre-Ryanair time when England and the rest of Europe were still miles apart. Its a story of detente and new beginnings as fierce rivals Hunt and Lauda come to something of an understanding as we watch them contest race after race around the globe during the 1976 Grand Prix season. You wonder what effect the F1 documentary Senna had on Rush. There are parallels the rivalry of course but also an explosive row and a horrifying crash. Maybe Senna just reassured the filmmakers that audiences beyond F1 fans would care. Theyve gone all out to make Rush look exciting. Cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle matches the films look to period archive footage and finds angles and perspectives youd think impossible. Its anything but boring. Its also one of those cheeky real-life tales that Morgan adores a portrait of people in crisis who live their lives in the public glare whether its the Queen Nixon or Tony Blair. Rush is fast slippery stormy and dangerous.

From 1950 to 1980 a staggering 42 men lost their lives competing in the sport of Formula One racing. Thats a stunning number isnt it? The fatality count lurks beneath the surface of Ron Howards ""Rush"" especially when the film reminds you that someone would have to be a bit of a lunatic to strap themselves into a 180mph bomb with nothing but highly combustible fuel tanks as buffers. The two main characters of the film which is based upon a true story are drivers Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) and James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth). The two couldnt be more different Lauda an Austrian is all precision and science while the British Hunt embodies confidence and wild abandon. Their lifestyles method of driving and motivations are clearly in direct opposition creating a natural rivalry that shows off the best side of sport the true beauty of serious competition. We dont get many films about professional racing only ""Senna"" ""Days of Thunder"" and ""Talladega Nights"" come immediately to mind so its always refreshing to see a film attempt to capture the speed and power of the elegant machines built to satiate humankinds relentless need to race. Director Ron Howard does well here to put you behind the wheel but also gives us continually alternating views we see the spectators owners and television announcers routinely. Given the drivers are wearing helmets and speed is difficult to convey without physical movement accolades should be handed out to a film that more than once makes you think ""Aaargh dont crash"" A rich triumph that gracefully hammers home its themes""Rush"" sets expectations and then defies them the narrative crowning a hero only to show that there may have been another way to get there. The most compelling force in the film isnt one of the main characters so much as it is the idea of two people pushing each other to the brink and then way over it. There are only a few tiny items to quibble with where ""Rush"" is concerned minor details that shouldnt be more than a speed bump on your road to enjoyment. The first is a merciless use of ""Gimme Some Lovin"" in a montage of racing it comes off as completely cheesy plus it was already used in a racing movie ""Days of Thunder"" (along with a couple dozen other films). Additionally the first 45 minutes of the film are also fairly rote content to set the stage and little more. Lastly ugh definitely avoid the trailer to this film. I was unlucky enough to see it prior to seeing the film and the marketing folks really should take a bow for revealing so many crucial plot points. If you can go into ""Rush"" unspoiled your experience will be seriously heightened so hopefully youre able to pull off that trick. However ""Rush"" has a multitude of strengths that far outweigh any deficiencies. It often portrays the very face of courage but its also clever enough to present two different versions as courage isnt a ""one size fits all"" attribute. There arent really good and bad guys here the characters feature more depth than those simple labels and the narrative is much more complex than your average sports film. The movie also follows one of the cardinal rules of good cinema it ends like a freight train. Theres a subtle little pivot switching the audiences sympathy which is almost never done by anyone who doesnt have the label ""Best Director"" attached to their resume. Ron Howard has two of those Academy Awards so clearly hes able to set the pace and make the film he wants to and it shows as the initial standard setup is jettisoned for something truly unique and ambitious by the closing moments. ""Rush"" is to be lauded for portraying motor sports as something more than fast cars going round and round getting to the heart of what it is to risk your life every time you do your job. The glory the lethal mistakes the differing personalities needed to sustain excellence on the edge ""Rush"" has a sprinkling of each of these elements plus comedy and tension as well finishing as a film thats firing on wait for it all cylinders. As a movie that takes full advantage of the big screen using excellent sound design paired with intimate camera angles in order to make you feel the throttle ""Rush"" is one of those rare sports movies thats compelling as both a drama and a spectacle. SCORE 8.6 / 10 Laremy wrote the book on film criticism and wishes he could hoist a championship trophy just once.

TWITTER Ron Howard returns to his high-speed roots to explore the 1970s Formula One rivalry between Chris Hemsworths James Hunt and Daniel Bruhls Niki Lauda. Ron Howard returns to the high-speed roots of his directorial debut Grand Theft Auto (albeit with a budget probably a hundred times bigger) with Rush an involving Formula One racing drama centered on the nasty mid-70s rivalry between two drivers who couldnt have been more dissimilar. Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl excel as respectively British wild man and hedonist James Hunt and Austrian by-the-books tactician Niki Lauda. Limited American interest in European Formula One means Universal wont be seeing anything resembling Fast amp; Furious business at the box office but international returns could be very substantial. Most modern-era car racing movies from Grand Prix and Le Mans to Days of Thunder have been far stronger at portraying the excitement on the track than at developing interesting downtime drama among the characters. But rather the reverse is true with Rush which offers perfectly coherent racing coverage but devotes far more time to exploring the personalities of two drivers who represented behavioral polar extremes and drove each other to distraction. PHOTOS 25 of Falls Most Anticipated Movies Its a credit to Peter Morgans screenplay that one can come to understand and sympathize with both of them even though there are many reasons one might not easily warm to either one. Just as young ladies threw themselves at the great-looking Hunt literally by the thousands (one line describes his sexual prowess as ""immortal"") female viewers might be persuaded to attend a racing film simply because of Chris Hemsworth who looks fantastic with his long blond locks and ready smile and has finally found a role he can really score with in every sense of the word. His looks and devil-may-care attitude aside (at one point he ventures that women like race car drivers because of ""our closeness to death"") Hunt is the kind of figure who dares you to take him seriously; he stays up all night before races never abstains from sex and is seen taking swigs of booze right before races. Purists and the more serious-minded are bound to disapprove of this guy as they did in real life. Offering a 180-degree contrast is Lauda who comes from a conservative Viennese background but defies his family by taking up racing. He buys his way on to teams and is meticulous about engine specs and team discipline. An all-work-and-no-play guy he cares nothing for ingratiating himself with his team members and his abrupt marriage proposal to the pragmatic and supportive Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara) formerly a girlfriend of film star Curt Jurgens feels more like a business venture than a love match. STORY Ron Howards Rush to Get Exclusive Openings in New York and Los Angeles Physically Hunt taunts Lauda as ""my ratty little friend"" and with a pasty brown face and protruding teeth the Austrian awfully well played by Daniel Bruhl really does resemble a rodent. Hes a chilly character for sure brusque and reserved; as the guy behind the wheel hes not asking for love from his Ferrari team just maximum effort to put him in a position to win the F1 championship which he does in 1975. With his former team falling apart Hunt who has married high-maintenance blond beauty Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde) is desperate to do ""whatever it takes to beat that prick"" ultimately hitching on with McLaren despite their wariness over his erratic reputation. Presenting atmospheric snippets of the 1976 seasons early races in Sao Paulo South Africa Spain and Monaco the film creates an impressionistic rather than dramatic picture of a racing season that sees Lauda jump ahead in points. Morgan develops a dovetailing emotional dynamic between the drivers when after rubbing it in with Hunt that his wife has left him for actor Richard Burton Lauda finally marries Marlene only to find that happiness seems to be a detriment to his driving. By contrast Hunts edgy turbulence in the wake of his very public embarrassment motivates him to drive faster. The turning point comes at the Nurburgring track in Germany aka The Graveyard notorious as the most dangerous course on the F1 circuit. The rainy conditions compel Lauda to propose cancelling the race but Hunt leads the move to vote it down. Sure enough the meticulous Lauda then has a terrible accident; hes stuck in his burning car for more than a minute and suffers terrible burns to his head and lungs. VIDEO Rush Trailer The recovery shown in more than sufficient detail is terribly painful; his lungs must be vacuumed and trying to put a helmet on is purest torture. Lauda both blames Hunt for the accident and credits him for motivating him to get back on the track an amazing 42 days later but not before Hunt pummels a tasteless journalist who asks Lauda at a press conference if he thinks his wife will stay with him now that he looks so bad. In Laudas absence Hunt has made up a lot of points but the Austrian puts on an amazing display so that the championship will be determined in the final race of the season in Japan within view of Mount Fuji -- and in heavy rain. In the wake of the season the two men remain at odds -- they are far too different and too competitive to ever be friends -- but they do understand each other in a way that perhaps only fellow professionals can. Weve never gotten particularly close to these very distinct personalities but theyre interesting and lively company for the two hours theyre onscreen due to the sharply etched performances of the two leads. Thats more than you can say for anyone else in the film as Morgan hasnt bothered to add more than one dimension to any of the other characters nor to provide especially memorable dialogue. The racing footage is serviceable enough although there are no attempts at the sorts of amazing shots or extended bravura driving sequences that previous filmmakers have sometimes pulled off.  Rather than brilliantly clear Anthony Dod Mantles cinematography has something of the grubby visual quality of 70s films -- particularly of international co-productions of the time which is sort of amusing. Its startling to be reminded of how flimsy and delicate the cars of the time looked and of how common it was for drivers to be badly injured or killed. The very fine and successful 2010 documentary feature Senna underlined that fact and may actually have been an impetus for this films creation.

Add to that list of epic clashes Formula One adversaries James Hunt and Niki Lauda whose larger-than-life bout for the 1976 world championship title fuels Ron Howards exhilarating ""Rush"" -- not just one of the great racing movies of all time but a virtuoso feat of filmmaking in its own right elevated by two of the years most compelling performances. Its high-octane entertainment that demands to be seen on the bigscreen assembled for grown-ups and executed in such a way as to enthrall even those whove never watched a race in their life.This story first appeared in the September 10 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. Audience skepticism could give ""Rush"" a slow start in theaters as folks question why they should care about such a subject -- or wonder what Howard who has spent the past decade churning out respectable middle-brow entertainments can bring to the material. But if Universal gives word of mouth a chance to build (screening the film at the Deauville and Toronto film festivals is a good start) they should have a huge worldwide phenomenon on their hands. The hook couldnt be simpler ""Rush"" pits two personalities from opposite ends of the spectrum against one another in a sport where the stakes are no less than life and death. An Austrian with an innate gift for racing but no sense when it comes to social interaction Lauda (as played by ""Good Bye Lenins"" Daniel Bruhl) is the pragmatist to Hunts British playboy. Already plenty dashing in real life bad-boy Hunt proves even more irresistible in the hands of ""Thor"" star Chris Hemsworth who makes Hunts driving look like the least reckless thing about him. Whereas Hollywood screenwriters tend to give us clear-cut heroes and villains real life deals in far more ambiguous rivalries and Peter Morgans script manages to deliver complicated personalities with elegance and efficiency relying on these two fine actors to flesh them out onscreen. The two racers meet in the lower divisions where Hunt sparks a deep animosity with Lauda by pulling a risky move that could have gotten them both killed. However irresistible the call of glory ""Rush"" makes clear the potential cost of ego by depicting an accident early on A competitors car has smashed through a barrier and the driver is nowhere to be seen replaced by an ugly smear running down the length of the hood. SEE ALSO Ron Howards Rush for Independent Film Financing ""Twenty-five people start Formula One and each year two die. What kind of person does a job like this?"" asks Lauda at the outset. Those who know what happens to Lauda can appreciate the gravity of his question which perfectly conveys the edge-of-your-seat incredulity with which sane feet-on-the-ground types watch such races. Nothing could be worth putting oneself in such danger even in ideal driving conditions and yet the visceral thrill is undeniable -- and the mere presence of a worthy adversary enough to push great racers to peak performance. Modern audiences have been conditioned by the sheer volume of bad screenwriting they encounter day in day out to be wary of scripts that articulate their own themes as eloquently as humanly possible. ""Rush"" is such a film a rare thing where every utterance is ""on the nose"" and yet so perfectly calibrated it would be a crime to force the characters to bury their thematic concerns in subtext. Who needs inane reality-show naturalism when you can have life-and-death philosophy delivered at 200 miles per hour? As Hunt cavalierly describes his car (in Morgans words of course) ""Its just a little coffin really surrounded by high-octane fuel all around -- for all intents and purposes its a bomb on wheels."" No wonder the ladies find him so damned sexy Every time at the wheel could be his last. Even Lauda with his pinched-in cheeks and rat-like face has spent more time on the brink of death than any sane mortal hopes to experience in a lifetime. Hunt seems to view the time between races as bonus rounds to be lived to the fullest and the movie doesnt shy away from depicting his R-rated habits -- or the streak of spontaneous romanticism that inspires him to propose to model Suzy Miller within moments of meeting condensed from a courtship of several weeks in real life. (As Miller Olivia Wilde makes a strong enough impression one cant help but envy Hunts chutzpah.) ""Rush"" works so well because Lauda embodies everything Hunt isnt and though he too has the good fortune of meeting and marrying a compatible woman (Alexandra Maria Lara) during the 1976 season their relationship signifies something safer more calculated and built to endure. Both racers buy their way into F1 where Lauda engineers a faster car but Hunt embodies the reckless spirit audiences have come to love. It would be too easy to paint the cool-headed Germanic strategist as the villain here but the film is more balanced than that. Its as if two completely antithetical philosophies are on the line and the only way to settle the dispute is on the track. The thrill of ""Rush"" would stall if the off-road scenes were any less dynamic but of course its the racing moments that take the film to the next level. Partnering with d.p. Anthony Dod Mantle Howard seizes the opportunity to innovate in these retro-saturated sequences denying the boredom inherent in watching fast cars zip round and around the same track and integrating compact digital cameras directly into the automotive machinery itself. He takes audiences places that human eyes could never fit as the cars hurtle forward at top speed pioneering an intuitive visual logic that flows from the stands to the cars to the subjective perspective of the racers themselves -- never more frightening than during the climactic Mount Fuji Circuit race where rain reduces visibility and the drivers may as well be steering by ""the Force."" Though ""Rush"" extends across the duration of Hunt and Laudas hyper-competitive 1976 season no two races resemble one another as Howard and editors Daniel P. Hanley and Mike Hill find ways to condense an astounding amount of story into a hyper-efficient 123-minute running time. Another filmmaker might have made it shorter still and yet Howard recognizes the vitality of every moment how any sacrifice would diminish what makes these two characters so relatably human. Meanwhile the racing footage is white-knuckle stuff even -- or perhaps especially -- when one of them is out for the count watching on TV while he has his lungs vacuumed in hospital. To witness this level of storytelling skill (applied to a subject only a fraction of the public inherently finds interesting) is to marvel at not only what cinema can do when image sound and score are so artfully combined to suggest vicarious experience but also to realize how far Howard has come since his directorial debut 1977s bang-up ""Grand Theft Auto."" The technique is so cutting-edge its impossible to tell where the practical photography ends and visual effects begin -- and besides the two leading men are so enthralling audiences minds have little time to drift away from the human-interest story at its core. Too often in the intervening years Howard has played it safe but here his choices are anything but obvious. He embraces the power of music to heighten the experience but goes the opposite direction that one might expect with it using Hans Zimmers cello-driven score to steer things to a deeper place. The same goes for the story itself Who else would have imagined F1 as an appropriate conduit for existential self-examination? And yet youve seldom felt more alive in a movie theater than you will experiencing ""Rush."" Film Review RushReviewed at the Landmark Los Angeles Aug. 22 2013.

I saw the film last week and was quite blown away by how captivating it is and this coming from someone with little interest in F1. Fantastically executed. Reply Rolo says September 29 2013 at 651 pm Rush Howard directed a good movie Thor is a great aktor Those days of Mayberry Life are OVER FOR GOOD And Olivia DeWilde is a great aktress meant to empress oops impress... Too bad Rush didnt do the sound-track Kind of dorky like those WWE razzlers in loincloth tights yelling and walking half-nude like a French baguette at a beach Reply Terry says September 29 2013 at 635 pm Worked for Watkins Glen during the late 60s to mid 80s Have a black and white picture of Lauda and the Fittipaldis running toward the ""90"" at a start of a race in 1975. Oh the memories Cant wait to see the movie. Met most of the famous GP drivers that came through the ""GLEN"" To me Hunt and Lauda are completely different types. Niki is calm and calculated while James was all out party animal When I heard about this movie coming out I had to see it and feel those times again Reply Volker says September 20 2013 at 1146 pm One of the Best Racingfilms I have ever seen. Well done Reply billy kravitz (wilkravitz) says September 18 2013 at 1029 pm the RUSH THE MOVIE site followed a lot of people on Twitter acted real friendly and got some positive feed back.. then they unfollowed everybody... thats just what they did...wow now we know... yuck Reply vonryansexpress says September 15 2013 at 1101 am Compelling review however where is the cultural film memory to Frankenheimers seminal F1 film ""Grand Prix""? Discussions of digital wonder that do not recall Grand Prixs multi-camera varied screen opening fail to establish the nexus with the tradition that Mr. Howard is recreating. You have to know how you got here. Grand Prix was scored by Maurice Jarre---again the memory shows the movie redux. Reviewer? Reply Meridian says September 11 2013 at 843 pm Rush is a must see movie for anyone who wants to see true life triumph over adversity and unbeatable odds. The portrayal of James Hunt true to form but the portrayal and look into the efforts of Niki Lauder is well deserved and a long over due tribute to one of the people that have made significant impact on the automotive world as a whole. Reply Paul says September 8 2013 at 1240 pm Yet another bomb from the person that thought putting poor Jim Carrey in a Grinch costume let alone thought an audience would enjoy a film about David Frost and Nixon. And I honestly think the audience has simply passed old Opie right on by. At least hes trying but he hasnt got a clue what the audience wants to see. At this point most films are dying a quick death. This film would be DOA if it werent for the action scenes the ones without the sex and other than that its pretty awful. It also has the R rating kiss of death so all the teens who would go to catch a steamy sex scene cant get in the theatre. If hed toned it down a bit he might have been able to at least appeal to the kids. Maybe theyll make money of PPV and dvd sales. Reply Dan Ivers says September 21 2013 at 1011 am Surely youve made better films right? Where can we see them? What a sad miserable person you must be. Reply Rom says September 25 2013 at 832 am +1 Dan  Hmmm says September 25 2013 at 306 am Its called criticism. Whats more troubling to me is the state of this Variety review. Although I guess you can read the condescension between the lines if you really try I suppose. Bubbles says September 6 2013 at 256 am Excellent review. I went to a screening last night and was blown away. A fantastic movie - I just hope it gets the audience it deserves. Reply Alan Rinfret says September 4 2013 at 1252 pm Been waiting for this film for several months. This review makes the wait worth every day. In addition to the competition between Hunt and Lsufait is important to note that these were also some of Formula most dangerous years. Poor safety barriers crowds too close to the tracks plus racing in suits that had little If any ability to retard flames. Add to that the fastest racing cars in the world and a driver in James Hunt who oftentimes drove in a condition that would have resulted in his arrest on city street. This is a movie that I hope many will see. Reply bighaydo says September 4 2013 at 213 am Errm... Only a fraction of people find F1 interesting? Outside of the football world cup and the Olympics youre talking about one of the highest viewed sports in the world Hopefully the realisation that this is based on an actual story (albeit embellished somewhat for effect) should add a bit of gravity to the leading characters and that their feats are not inconsequential. Never one for vanity Lauds bears his scars from 1976 to thus very day. Reply JP says September 4 2013 at 124 pm There is a new F1 dedicated Magazine coming out soon called ""Lollipop."" http//lollipopmagazine.tumblr.com Reply Troy Webster says September 3 2013 at 1149 am I am amazed at your description of Ron Howards playing it safe and how this is so far out of his genre and then you add ""Howard seizes the opportunity to innovate in these sequences denying the boredom inherent in watching fast cars zip round and around the same track and integrating compact digital cameras directly into the automotive machinery itself. He takes audiences places that human eyes could never fit as the cars hurtle forward at top speed pioneering an intuitive visual logic ..."". And you give no credit to the Cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle??? He made ""Slum Dog..."" the visually exciting film that took it to another level and he has done it here with a very non-visual director. You credit the score but not the cinematography? And beyond the shots and sequences there is the retro film look that so fits the era. I dont think this accomplished without Mr. Dod Mantle and his research talent and work all the way through the DI color timing. Shame on you for acclaiming the visuals to be important enough to state ""...cinema can do when image sound and score are so artfully combined... "" with image leading the group Not to mention Mr. Dod Mantle by name is indicative of the ignorance of film critics who think it all comes from Herr Director Reply Julienne says September 3 2013 at 1106 am It will NOT compare to the Bobby Allison film...a true story. Reply JP says September 4 2013 at 125 pm Whos that? Reply Nobhob says September 4 2013 at 456 am Come on basic research Not only is the film a true story it is a reasonably truthful depiction of it not a ""based on"" like so many of Hollywoods ""true"" films.Bobby Allison? Formula 1 has always been international- a claim that cant ever be made with NASCAR. The makeup on Daniel Bruhl for the second part of the movie really makes those with a basic knowledge of the story do a double-take- it is absolutely correct. I wonder what Niki thought at the premier... Reply JP says September 4 2013 at 127 pm Lets hope it takes the world by storm. Im in Europe and it is advertised EVERYWHERE - Germany France Italy etc. Elizabeth says September 3 2013 at 221 pm Okay you do realize this is also a true story? Have you already seen the movie? If not how can you make that assumption? Reply Thomas says September 3 2013 at 1034 am Rush is going to kill it. Reply JP says September 4 2013 at 125 pm Lets hope we can get Americans to start watching Reply Rafael Sanchez says September 3 2013 at 1005 am September. Not a good month for new movies. Reply sbob says September 3 2013 at 923 am ""the sheer volume of bad screenwriting they encounter day in day out"" -- wow really? Just going to dump that in and keep recklessly driving on. The whole industry lives on the back of the seminal creations of screenwriters. Their solo efforts are too often butchered by nervous execs who have as many as fifteen different writers try to get it it ""right"". It is the screenplay alone that attracts the director and the talent. Rarely is a screenplay praised when everything works because of course it was the director and the actor... and here we are left with your short sighted barely contemplated blather... ""Rush"" works so well because... it started with a good screenplay by a very talented artist. Reply bighaydo says September 4 2013 at 219 am Not to mention that this will be a film closely scrutinized by F1 purists. Poor screenwriting could be paramount to actual life with Rush either that or having to reduce a highly complex sport to be comprehended by a broader audience..
