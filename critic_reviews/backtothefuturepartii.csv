Newsday + - ""Back To The Future Part II"" earned two-and-a-half stars from Newsday when it hit theaters in 1989. Here Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown and Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly in the film. Photo Credit Universal City Studios / Ralph Nelson advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW ""Back to the Future Day"" is Wednesday Oct. 21 2015 -- the date Marty McFly and Doc Brown time-traveled to in the 1989 sequel ""Back to the Future Part II."" Below is Newsdays original film review which ran Wednesday Nov. 22 1989 the same day the movie premiered in theaters. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless Comedy Central upset over use of fake Colbert? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Messing Shelton call truce after spat over Trump Matt Damon says hes taking a year-long acting break ----- Young Marty McFly and old Doc Brown once again trip in sprightly fashion from future to past stopping occasionally at the present. Technically dazzling increasingly familiar sometimes confusing. Starring Michael J. Fox Christopher Lloyd Lea Thompson Thomas F. Wilson. Directed by Robert Zemeckis. At area theaters. Time travel is not without its perils. As wild-haired ""Doc"" Brown (Christopher Lloyd) warns young Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) there is a danger It might just ""destroy the entire world -- granted thats a worst-case scenario."" Movies26 movies we cant stop watching In ""Back to the Future Part II"" our two intrepid time commuters have dashed off to the year 2015 to prevent Martys future son from committing a criminal act. While theyre busy righting future wrongs Biff the town bully (once again Thomas F. Wilson) borrows their time machine goes back to the year 1953 and gives himself young Biff a 2015 sports almanac that enables him to make millions wagering on upcoming sports events while simultaneously altering the course of history and creating an ""alternate reality."" advertisement | advertise on newsday Returning to the year 1985 Marty discovers just how much havoc Biffs mischief has caused. Young Biffs sudden gambling prowess has made him the wealthiest man on Earth and once-bucolic Hill Valley is now dominated by a towering skyscraper casino ""Biffs Pleasure Palace."" Home windows are barred gates are locked the school principal trades shotguns blasts with roaming truants rotting car-hulks line the streets and bands of motorcyclists are drawn by the ""Bikers Welcome"" signs. In the new revised Hill Valley Doc Brown is in an insane asylum McFlys father has been murdered and his mother complete with breast implants is married to Biff. Observes Marty ""Its like were in hell or something."" Not exactly. Its more like were back in Pottersville in ""Its a Wonderful Life."" Pottersville youll remember is what would have happened to Bedford Falls if good old George Bailey had never lived -- a perfect illustration of that movies message the difference that one decent man makes to a community and to every person in that community. While the revised vision of Hill Valley seems a direct ripoff of that vastly superior film it dramatically illustrates the weaknesses of ""Back to the Future Part II."" There seems little import or impact to McFlys nightmarish world -- none of the meaning none of the terror that made ""Its a Wonderful Life"" so memorable. While director Robert Zemeckis technical wizardry (in addition to the initial ""Back to the Future"" he did ""Roger Rabbit"") will always draw praise the special effects come at the expense of human effects. However what draws the strongest audience response is neither his sometimes dazzling vision of the future nor his romanticized image of the past but his light-hearted commentary on our present. Future executives for example are Japanese and future criminals are sentenced within hours of the crime because ""The justice system works well . . . now that weve abolished all lawyers."" EntertainmentBig pop culture anniversaries in 2015 The humor tends to be mild and while the funny-bone is being gently tickled the eye is constantly diverted. Unfortunately and I find this true of every Zemeckis movie neither the mind nor the heart is ever fully engaged. Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff Considering that the original ""Back to the Future"" made 350 million and was the top-grossing film of 1985 a trip ahead to the past was inevitable. The irony is this A Zemeckis film gets its strength from novelty and sequels are by definition the enemy of novelty. The closing words of the current film -- ""To Be Concluded . . . "" indicate there will be only one additional sequel (already filmed at the same time as this one) and I sincerely hope that is not just an idle promise.

"`Back To Future Part Ii` A Disappointing Sequel - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs `Back To Future Part Ii` A Disappointing SequelNovember 24 1989|By Gene Siskel.Our Flick of the Week is ``Back to the Future Part II`` which turns out to be a surprisingly oppressive rapid-fire noisy gadget-filled action picture lacking the emotion of the original film. In this second film of a planned trilogy all of the key players are back with the significant exception of Crispin Glover who played Michael J. Fox`s father. Their relationship formed the heart of the original film and that`s what`s missing here.The story takes place in the future and in the past as Fox and Christopher Lloyd as the Doc try to avert both a disastrous life for Fox`s son as well as a prosperous life for the evil Biff Tannen Fox`s longtime enemy. This movie might as well have been called ``Biff`` because his character dominates the action whining screaming and pummeling those around him.The only inventive elements in the mix are scenes that takes us back into the original film but from another point of view as Michael J. Fox tries to maintain the integrity of the past as we know it. Writer director Robert Zemeckis has made more of a helter-skelter action picture along the lines of his ``Used Cars`` than a warm-hearted story similar to his ``I Wanna Hold Your Hand.``Youngsters may enjoy looking at such futuristic gadgets as a hovering skateboard and sport shoes that automatically tie themselves. But a little of that doesn`t sustain ``Part Two`` which leaves us hanging at the end promising a story ``to be continued`` in the Old West.``Back to the Future Part II`` is playing at the Water Tower Webster Place and outlying theaters.

To answer the most pressing question second the new film (which opens today) is a lot of fun anyway.Part II begins where Part I left off in 1985 at the Hill Valley home of teen-ager Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox). Martys scientist friend Doctor Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) has just arrived with dire news of the future. So Marty his wife-to-be and Doc Brown settle back in the time-hopping DeLorean (you know the one with the flux capacitor) and zip off to the year 2015.Before the movie is over Doc and Marty must return to the Hill Valley of 1955 (where most of the original film was set) and also travel to an altered nightmarish version of Hill Valley 1985 in which Martys dad is dead and in which the heavy Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) is married to Martys mom Lorraine (Lea Thompson). Just as Part II is ending we learn that there will be a Part III (due out this coming summer) in which Marty will find himself in yet another era. (I dont want to give away the time period but youll have a clue if you can remember what was playing at the town-square movie theater in the Hill Valley of 1955.)Back to the Future Part II tells a complicated tale sections of which will be virtually incomprehensible to anyone who hasnt watched (or doesnt remember) Part I. If youre in that unfortunate category and youhave any intention of seeing the new movie go immediately to your favorite video store and rent the original. If you dont have a VCR I hope you saw the broadcast of Back to the Future on NBC last Friday. (If you missed that broadcast and dont have access to a VCR your best bet is to find a time machine set the dial for 1985 and see the first film there.)Although Part II is less wonderful than Part I director Robert Zemeckis and writer Bob Gale (the original team) have not been content simply to settle for a weak copy. In the new movie they do return to themes and situations from the first film but they often find clever twists and sometimes spin the movie off in surprising directions.Their view of the future for example is imaginative and amusing. In 2015 shoes lace themselves men wear two neckties at once lawyers have been abolished skateboards are replaced by flying hoverboards the Jaws series is up to number 19 and the Chicago Cubs finally win another series. And if you laughed at the problems Marty had ordering a Pepsi Free in Part I youll chuckle when he encounters a drink called Pepsi Perfect in Part II. (He gets it at a restaurant called Cafe 80s a nostalgia place where the waiters are Max Headroom-like versions of Michael Jackson the Ayatollah Khomeini and - shades of Doonesbury - Ronald Reagan.)When we return to 1955 its facinating to see how the filmmakers have squeezed new developments into familiar sequences. Its like deja vu-plus to discover that just as Marty was finishing up his guitar solo at the Enchantment Under the Sea dance another Marty was getting ready to drop sandbags on three creeps standing backstage.Many of the reasons that Part II doesnt fully measure up to Part I are due to factors that were probably unavoidable. Crispin Glover who played Martys father in the first movie didnt participate in the filming of the second and though Zemeckis and Gale have been ingenious in compensating for his absence the absence is felt nonetheless.And Part II inevitably suffers from middle-act droop. Its so busy tying up loose ends from Part I and creating loose ends that will presumably be tied up in Part III that it doesnt seem as brilliantly structured as the first one did.And the new film is so preoccupied with plot bridgework that it never becomes as warm and human as its predecessor. Michael J. Fox Christopher Lloyd Lea Thompson and Thomas F. Wilson offer performances more-or-less comparable to the ones they originally gave and some of these actors play their characters at more than one age. (Wilson gives us four versions of Biff plus Biffs grandson while Foxs quintuple role includes two teen Martys Marty in his 40s Martys son and even Martys daughter).But the relationships among the characters arent developed any further than they were in Part I. The experience of watching the first film was enchanting like seeing one of those wonderful clocks in which figurines emerge in perfect sychronization strike gongs on cue and bow to each other as if they were really alive. Watching some sections of the new film is more like seeing that clock being wound.And I must say I was also a little disappointed that Zemeckis and Gale missed prime opportunities to make comic references to aspects of the original movie. They do follow up on their earlier mentions of Reagan and Pepsi among other people and things. But considering the presence of Libyan terrorists and Chuck Berrys cousin in Part I shouldnt Reagans co-waiters at Part IIs Cafe 80s have been Chuck Berry and Moammar Gadhafi?Oh well I guess these are basically quibbles. As I say the most important point is that the new film is fun. Its simultaneously an entertaining follow-up to Part I and a tantalizing introduction to Part III (which is billed as the sagas conclusion). As far as Im concerned the third film cant get here fast enough.Fire up that flux capacitor MORELottery results for Powerball Florida LottoLottery results for Powerball Florida LottoDo your homework before painting or sealing cool deckPuerto Rico birth certificates How to get a new oneLottery results for Powerball Florida LottoLottery results for Powerball Florida Lotto Related ArticlesTime Travel Takes On New DimensionSeptember 19 1993Amusing And Clever Twists In backJune 21 1998Its Future Shock In Part 2 Of TrilogyOctober 16 1994Future Back-to-back-to-back Has 3-part HarmonyJune 1 1990This Future Holds Adventure Action And LaughsMay 25 1990Index by Keyword|Index by Date|Privacy Policy|Terms of ServicePlease note the green-lined linked article text has been applied commercially without any involvement from our newsroom editors reporters or any other editorial staff.,http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1989-11-22/lifestyle/8911222587_1_marty-part-ii-biff-tannen,200,backtothefuturepartii2,backtothefuturepartii,orlandosentinel

But the movie cant sidestep the real truth that confronts every sequel-maker.Some successful films that provoke the demand for a sequel - or more accurately the desire to turn a dollar by cinematic recycling - end with such resounding finality that theres really nothing left to add. Steven Spielbergs Jaws is a prime example - its follow-ups were merely toothless repetitions of his deep-sea drama. Other movies - Spielbergs Raiders of the Lost Ark and Bob Zemeckis Back to the Future - leave open the possibility of viably continuing a story line. But these originals have a freshness exuberance and excitement of discovery that no one - not even the creators - can hope to replicate.Zemeckis has reassembled most of the principals from his 1985 megahit Back to the Future and filmed two sequels that give new meaning to the expression back-to-back. Back to the Future Part II opens today and Part III will be here next summer. Depending on your point of view this is cynical sequel- mongering run amok or economic and logistical common sense. Certainly this tandem approach to filmmaking suggests that Zemeckis coming off the global success of his 1988 blockbuster Who Framed Roger Rabbit might be disposed to just mail this one (or two) in.But to their credit Zemeckis and screenwriter Bob Gale have obviously made an effort where they could have simply made a walk-through to the bank. The duo has taken the story in several directions probably too many for the length of the movie. Sophisticated camera technology has also made it possible for Michael J. Fox returning as Marty McFly to interact with himself.The hardware allows a stroke of ingenuity in the story Marty goes back to 1955 at the point in time at which he intervened to save his parents romance and thus his own future. Since he is already there in the reality of the first movie he is in effect watching himself as he also frantically makes adjustments that will prevent a different and calamitous turn of events from unfolding.Many directors reflecting on their past work have fantasized about being allowed to reshoot scenes but Zemeckis has the freedom to go one step further - he reshoots scenes in the context of ones already shot. What he does not have however is something that was at the core of the original.Beyond its intricate comic structure and attention to jokes that springfrom little details Back to the Future had a lot of heart. There was a Capraesque charm to the picture and it made the most of its rich premise by having a teenager face something most teenagers find inconceivable. Namely that their parents were once teenagers themselves. It lent point and substance to the gags.There are many jests strewn through Part II especially when Marty and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) take off for the voyage to the future suggested at the close of the first film. In the world of 2015 where the kids get around on skateboards that work like tiny hovercraft Marty has to look out for his kids. Anyone who makes his way around the crack-infested streets of our cities will find Zemeckis view of the world 25 years hence uncommonly rosy. But the satirical contrasts between our sorry present state and this idealized future world could have been more strenuously and inventively explored.There is work for Marty and Brown to do in all three time zones - 1955 1985 and 2015. The narrative hinges on a sports almanac containing that ultimate gamblers dream the results of every major sporting event. Armed with this prescient text Martys old nemesis Biff has become a millionaire and married Martys mother. Back to the Future Part II deals mostly with the possession of the almanac and its pivotal place in the protagonists fate.Fans of the original should relish going back to Back to the Future as long as they keep in mind that in movies - as in life - you cant go home again. And if you do things arent likely to be the same.BACK TO THE FUTURE PART II   1/2Produced by Bob Gale and Neil Canton; directed by Robert Zemeckis; written by Bob Gale; photography by Dean Cundey; music by Alan Silvestri; distributed by Universal Studios.Running time 1 hour 48 mins.Marty McFly - Michael J.

"Jaunt Back A Glum Trip - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Jaunt Back A Glum TripSpirit Missing In `Future` SequelNovember 22 1989|By Dave Kehr Movie critic.Disappointing as it is ``Back to the Future Part II`` does represent something new in sequels.The follow-up to what was with more than 350 million in worldwide ticket sales the top-grossing film of 1985 ``Back to the Future Part II`` is the first extension of a hit that takes place not before or after the original but simultaneously with it.In the new film time-travelers Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) must go back from the present to 1955 the time frame of the original picture in order to straighten out a potential logical paradox that threatens the stability of the universe. As they do so the climax of the first movie plays out in the background behind them complete with duplicate selves who must be avoided if the cosmos is to be kept from flying out of balance.If that sounds confusing it is and that isn`t the worst of it. Directed by Robert Zemeckis from a screenplay by Bob Gale (the team responsible for the highly entertaining first outing) ``Back to the Future Part II`` is a movie that must spend most of its running time explaining its hopelessly complicated premises which leaves very little room for anything much to happen.So much effort seems to have gone into working out the logistics of the plot that the filmmakers have little energy left to spend on one crucial ingredient of the original-its extravagant comedy. Where Part I buzzed by on its cartoonish exaggeration inventive slapstick and the outrageous Oedipal joke at its center (would the teenage hero be forced to sleep with his own mother?) Part II is glum claustrophobic and often oppressive.The picture begins brightly enough with a visit to a typical suburb of 2015 where things seem just as mindless and superficial as they did in 30 years earlier although now the Cubs have won the World Series. Consumerism still reigns and Zemeckis and Gale underline the point by allowing the number of paid product plugs-for everything from self-tying Nikes to the Mattel hover-boards that have replaced the banal skate variety-to mount up to the point of absurdity making a self-deprecating gag of their own greed. It`s the one passage in the film worthy of the authors of the overlooked 1980 classic ``Used Cars.``But from there the film returns to an ``alternate`` 1985 where the pleasant suburb of Hilldale has been turned into a nightmare vision of urban decay presided over by the thuggish Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) the greaser heavy of the original now become a Trump-like casino magnate. It`s to prevent Biff`s rise that Marty and Doc must go back again to 1955.The special effects are often ingenious and they`ve been dropped into the story with an admirable off-handedness that makes them seem in retrospect all the more impressive. Zemeckis has picked up a few tricks from his experience as the director of ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit`` His computer-driven camera now moves with apparent freedom when actors confront their doubled selves in the same frame an effect impossible a few years ago when a double exposure required an absolutely immobile camera setup.But technique without spirit doesn`t count for much and the spirit of``Back to the Future Part II`` is really that of an extended coming-attractions trailer. The filmmakes such close and arcane reference to Part I that it seems designed in part to boost video rentals of the original as puzzled viewers go running back to the primary text to figure out what they missed.And by its climax Part II has literally turned into previews for Part III filmed back-to-back with the present effort and due for release in the summer of 1990. One can only hope that Zemeckis and Gale`s next trip back to the future doesn`t become another grim journey back to the well.`BACK TO THE FUTURE PART II`(STAR)(STAR)Directed by Robert Zemeckis written by Bob Gale photographed by Dean Cundey production designed by Rick Carter edited by Arthur Schmidt and Harry Keramidas music by Alan Silvestri produced by Gale and Neil Canton.

WilsonBilly ZaneUniversal B+ Back to the Future Part II Starring Michael J. Fox Christopher Lloyd; Starring Elisabeth Shue Lea Thompson Thomas F. Wilson Billy Zane; Director Robert Zemeckis; Author Bob Gale; Producer (person) Steven Spielberg; Distributor Universal Posted May 25 1990 -- 1200 AM EDT W.C. Fields didnt actually say ""Never give a sequel an even break"" but years of lame follow-up movies have made betting against their quality a sound wager. Occasionally though a long shot does pan out and the second installment of Michael J. Foxs time-travel adventure is very nearly as good as the first. Picking up exactly where the original left off Back to the Future Part II begins as Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) set the time-traveling DeLoreans controls for the year 2015 where the villainous grandson of bully Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) is about to draw Martys future son into a life of crime. Fortunately the Doc has a plan to protect the McFly familys good name in perpetuity. As every good science-fiction fan knows even well-intentioned tampering with the future is a tricky proposition. The films heroes prevent one catastrophe only to discover that the safety of the entire world depends on their forestalling another this time in 1955 -- coincidentally the chronological site for much the original Back to the Future. Weaving breathless new action into events from that movie makes for a complicated yarn in Part II but the gambit works What better way to underscore the paradoxes of returning in time than to have the sequel return to the original? Those who relished Future Is warm family humor may be unpleasantly surprised by the sequels frenetic pace and emotional distance. Where the first film was like a TV sitcom using time travel as its whimsical premise this resembles a mildly violent comic book. Its all action and macho adventure with more sci-fi than romance. As dissimilar in tone as the two films are Foxs winning personality bridges the gap with ease. For their part director Zemeckis and coscreenwriter Bob Gale have remained true to the originals ground rules. Their four-dimensional quandary is imaginatively disorienting but internally logical and again peppered with subtle bits of wit. Their version of the future promises power shoelaces dust-repellent paper 80s nostalgia and no lawyers. All in all Future II is another fantastic voyage in a thoroughly entertaining contraption.

The energy and heart which Robert Zemeckis and story-writing partner Bob Gale (who takes solo screenplay credit this time) poured into the ingenious story of part one is diverted into narrative mechanics and camera wizardry in Future II. The story starts exactly where the original left off with Michael J. Foxs Marty McFly and Christopher Lloyds visionary inventor Dr Emmett Brown taking off in their flying DeLorean time machine for 2015 on an urgent mission to save Foxs children from a terrible fate. Future II finds the McFly family living in shabby lower-middle class digs in a world that isnt so much Orwellian as a gaudier and tackier projection of the present day. What matters to Fox is that his son has become a wimp just like his father was in the 1955 segment of the original film. Then in a curious narrative lapse Fox picks up a sports almanac which if taken back to the past will enable him to get rich by gambling on future events. But villainous Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) absconds with it in the time machine to give it to his 1955 self and the chase begins. Zemeckis fascination with having characters interact at different ages of their lives hurts the film visually and strains credibility past the breaking point by forcing him to rely on some very cheesy makeup designs. 1989 Nomination Best Visual Effects Back to the Future Part IIProductionAmblin/Universal.

Comments Back to the Future Part II The further adventures of Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and ""Doc"" Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) take them from 1985 to 2015 and back and then back to 1955 after a mishap in the future involving the villain (Thomas F. Wilson) creates a universe parallel to the one they left. The problem with all the time-travel high jinks involving multiple versions of the major characters (a gimmick that Robert Heinlein handled much better in stories like ""By His Bootstraps"" and ""All You Zombies--"") is that in order to make the plot even semiintelligible writer Bob Gale and director-cowriter Robert Zemeckis have to turn all these characters into strident geeks and make the frenetic action strictly formulaic. (Significantly the principal ""romantic"" interest Elisabeth Shue is knocked unconscious early on so she wont interfere with the little-boy games and Fox briefly playing his own sister in drag only adds to the rampant misogyny.) Theres a bit of fun in the 2015 section (although this notion of the future is more nostalgic and Disneyfied than genuinely speculative) but the shrill simplicities that follow become increasingly mechanical. By the end you may feel that youve just sat through a feature-length commercial for both part one (which has to be seen to make this sequel comprehensible) and part three (a trailer for it literally ends part two) along with a host of other consumables (from Pepsi to other Spielberg productions) and have been turned into a first-class geek along with the characters--an airhead consumer designed to wolf these products down. Please Mr. Spielberg give us all a break (1989).

"Back to the Future II Related Item Go to Video Finder Back to the Future II By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer November 24 1989 Director Robert Zemeckis Cast Michael J. Fox; Christopher Lloyd; Lea Thompson; Thomas F. Wilson; Elizabeth Shue; Charles Fleischer Parental guidance suggested Compare prices for this movie Find local video stores More movie shopping Save money with NextCard Visa IN ""BACK to the Future Part II"" theres a scene set in the year 2015 in which our familiar hero Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) encounters an 80s theme bar pounding with Michael Jackson music walled with multiscreens and featuring hovering videoscreen faces of Ronald Reagan and the Ayatollah Khomeini. Its meant to be a cute thing. So why is it so disconcerting? Maybe because this cleverly plotted but commercially overloaded sequel belongs right in that depressingly familiar bar.""Future II"" bombards you with more brand-name advertising than three hours of prime-time TV could muster although repeat filmmakers Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis put a humorous twist on everything. Among the collection of futuristic fad-gadgets (airborne skateboards clothes that blow-dry themselves) look for a hydratable mini-pizza from a well-known chain a new improved (and M.J. Fox-sponsored) soft drink and an equally famous running shoe that tightens itself (""I want a pair of those shoes"" said a moviegoer at a sneak screening).In keeping with this cultural-retread decade that our calendars promise will soon go away ""Future II"" is exhaustive with self-reference. Gale and Zemeckis give you not only the sequel but the original too. Fox (the Beaver of the 80s) and nutty professor Christopher Lloyd not only must return to the 1955 prom night of ""Future I"" (it has to do with chasing archenemy Biff Tanen) but also avoid their previous time-traveling selves -- the ones still trying to get young-Mom (Lea Thompson) and Dad (Crispin Glover -- seen only in flashback) together.This time-tripping caper to be followed by a third ""Future"" next summer is the kind of streamlined style-over-substance fare that will undoubtedly do well at the box office; Gale and Zemeckis have outdone themselves in terms of time-space shenanigans.But they have gone for narrative gymnastics rather than anything touching. ""Future I"" the smash hit of 1985 hit some timeless almost classical human chords that resonated beyond its snappy plotline Fox had to return to the past make his mother fall in love with his nerdy father and keep her from falling in love with her son-to-be. The suspense turned on character whims not just whizz-kid storyboarding.Here the suspense consists of a cosmic chore Fox and Lloyd (in their trusty DeLorean time machine) must retrieve a significant document from the past in order to prevent some terrible events in the future including danger to Foxs present and future family a rise to power for nemesis Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) and -- possibly the one event that almost justifies making this movie -- preventing a fifth presidential term for Richard Nixon.BACK TO THE FUTURE PART II (PG) (c) Copyright 1999 The Washington Post Company Back to the top",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/backtothefutureiihowe.htm,200,backtothefuturepartii10,backtothefuturepartii,washingtonpost
"Back to the Future II (PG) Back to the Future II (PG) By Rita Kempley Washington Post Staff Writer November 22 1989 Thick with corporate plugs and self-promotion ""Back to the Future Part II"" defines capitalism as an art form. Its a crass calculating feature-length billboard. Whatll you have? A Pepsi a Miller a pair of Nikes a tank of Texaco? Maybe a Pizza Hut pie smoking from a Black amp; Decker oven. A ""Jaws"" sequel? Or how about some of those ""Future II"" sunglasses on sale at a fast food outlet near you? This latest product from the Spielberg Factory is the last bite of the food chain a form of capitalistic cannibalism. Audiences pay to be insidiously manipulated by the conglomerates. And in this case they are paying to see a movie that theyve not only seen before but that theyll pay to see again. You see history repeats itself in ""Back to the Future Part II"" which is really a feature-length trailer for ""Back to the Future III."" The confounded tomfoolery doesnt even have an ending save ""To be continued in Back to the Future III. "" That as the Spielbergermeisters know wont matter a damn. Its all a matter of supply and carefully orchestrated demand. Like ""Batman"" its the latest must-see peer pressure carve the logo on your head designer blue jean experience. Of course you have to have seen the original to make any sense whatsoever out of the sequel. But hey thats more money for video rentals. ""Future II"" is a glib and glossy crowd-pleaser crafted honed and polished by Robert Zemeckis director-cowriter of the blithe original. Its clever but ultimately unsatisfying story sees heroes Marty McFly and Doc Brown hurtling up and down the space-time continuum in their familiar DeLorean. Except for Crispin Glover who is replaced by Jeffrey Weissman as George McFly members of the original cast enthusiastically reprise their earlier roles. The sequel takes up right where the prequel left off. Marty (Michael J. Fox) has just kissed his girlfriend when Doc (Christopher Lloyd) screeches back into Hilldale 1985 in his souped-up speedster. Wearing a clear tie and a pair of fluorescent solar glasses (remember on sale at a burger emporium near you) the agitated genius has been visiting the year 2015. ""Its your kids Marty. Somethings got to be done"" says Doc hurrying Marty and Jennifer (Elizabeth Shue) into the time machine. A theme-park-like future awaits. Conceived by an army of set designers special effects wizards and costumers the suburban paradise of 1985 California has become a popsicle-colored landscape filled with mellow moppets and refugees from the post-apocalypse of ""The Road Warrior."" Dont worry you can still pick up your USA Today on any street corner. Alas the McFlys Hilldale neighborhood is now down at the heels though every home is equipped with a scenery channel and such gadgets as a Black amp; Decker Pizza Hut pizza hydrator. Marty and Jennifer (Fox and Shue in lumpy makeup) have become losers like Martys parents were before he altered times fabric in the original. Marty Jr. (Fox) and his sister Marlene (Fox in drag) are a troubled wimp and a garrulous teen coquette respectively. In the meantime young Jennifer drugged for her own protection and stowed in an alley is picked up by two policewomen who thumbprint her and take her home where she plays hide and seek with her 47-year-old self. Meanwhile Doc and Marty Jr. tangle with Griff (Thomas F. Wilson) the antisocial grandson of Biff (Wilson) now a conniving old-timer. A hover board (flying skateboard) chase ensues while unbeknownst to the time travelers the past has been drastically altered. We never do learn what happens to the McFlys of the 21st century. Rather we return to 1955 to stop an event that has produced a hellish new 1985. Time McFlies when youre having fun. The alternative Hilldale is a laissez-faire nightmare of violence homelessness legalized gambling spouse abuse and toxic waste ruled by the now all-powerful Biff. Its like 1989. Biffs foul empire is symptomatic of the sequels overall meanspiritedness a refutation of the prequels frothy joys. ""Future II"" is to ""I"" as ""The Temple of Doom"" was to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" good clean giggles gone sour and mumpish. Its also extremely complicated. Zemeckis and longtime writing partner Bob Gale have devised a pop Rashomon -- the same scenes viewed from new perspectives. Its as snazzy a display of moviemaking legerdemain as Zemeckis gave us in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit."" The story line all things being relative makes about as much sense as turning your clock back when youre short of daylight. Its to be admired for its intricacies which promise to become even more arcane in ""Back to the Future III"" now in production. Maybe Zemeckis et al. see no point in ending ""Back to the Future Part II."" Maybe they figure the promise of more of the same is compelling to generations who teethed on reruns. Maybe theyre right. Certainly they arent naive. Whats missing is that wide-eyed innocence that set off the earlier Steven Spielberg sci-fi adventures the emotional core of ""E.T."" and ""Close Encounters"" the ingenuousness of McFly in ""Future I."" Here Marty is wide-eyed but hes turned into a proto-Charles Bronson. ""Nobody calls me chicken"" he says a retort that proves his undoing no matter what the decade. ""Future II"" poses the dramatic question Will he learn to control that redheads temper? Well just have to wait till 1990 wont we? Fox the me decades answer to Mickey Rooney will no doubt prove as irresistible to his followers as ever. His zany costar Lloyd remains a most beloved absent-minded professor a comic treasure despite a paucity of funny opportunities. Lea Thompson seems ill-used as the paunchy alcoholic mother in evil Hilldale. ""Back to the Future Part II"" makes America safe for suburban tomorrows for well-lighted malls and lots of cineplexes. It promises a holographic ""Jaws 19"" (""Now its really really personal"") and Nikes that automatically fasten themselves and robots that walk dogs. As Doc says to McFly when he is being attacked by Indians ... To be continued in ""Back to the Future III"" next year.
