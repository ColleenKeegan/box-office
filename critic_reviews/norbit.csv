"Norbit | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; norbit ) Norbit (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Now begins a period of prayer for Eddie Murphy - he must pray that no one who can cast a Best Supporting Actor vote in the 2007 Oscar race will see Norbit because no one in their right mind could think of providing an honor to anyone involved in this misfire Murphy included. All the goodwill built up for the actor as a result of Dreamgirls is cast aside by Norbit. The movie combines with Hannibal Rising to form an odd configuration on their shared opening weekend Hannibal Rising is a horror movie thats unintentionally comedic and Norbit is a comedy thats unintentionally horrifying. (Its mere existence is enough to cause that reaction.) Norbit takes the idea behind The Nutty Professor 2 - that Eddie Murphy can play just about every character in the movie - and strips it of all charm and humor. This movie belongs to the much-loved sub-genre of comedies called ""unfunny."" Its crass cruel and borderline offensive but the laughs that could redeem all of that are missing. Material as bad as the tripe that comprises Norbit can be endured only if theres a payoff. In this case the point seems to be that some actors will do anything for a buck. Norbit (Eddie Murphy) is a skinny geeky guy who after a lifelong search finds his perfect mate in the person of Kate (Thandie Newton) his best friend from the orphanage where they both lived as children. Years ago Kate moved away but now she has returned with the goal of buying the orphanage from elderly Mr. Wong (Murphy again). Two things stand in the way of Norbit and Kate finding happiness together Kates fiancA(c) Deion (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and Norbits wife Rasputia (Murphy the third). Rasputia is a particularly imposing impediment. Not only is she the size of a gorilla (with none of the charm or the manners) but she has three intimidating brothers. They want the orphanage so they can turn it into a strip club. Murphy doesnt do any acting in Norbit. This is all shtick - the kind of stuff that might work in a five-minute skit on Saturday Night Live. Norbit is a supersized version of Steve Urkel. Rasputia is Big Momma with bigger boobs. And Mr. Wong is a politically incorrect caricature of a racist Asian. At least the movie has Thandie Newton. This isnt a film shell highlight on her resume but for anyone unfortunate enough to be stuck watching Norbit she is easy on the eyes. Newton has always been a lovely actress with talent to match her looks but she may have never looked better on screen than in Norbit. And as for Cuba Gooding Jr. - who would have thought he could have uncovered a movie worse than Boat Trip in which to appear? Norbit operates on the principle that vulgarity is automatically funny. Crassness doesnt need a joke attached because it is (in and of itself) the height of hilarity. The very sight of Eddie Murphy simultaneously in drag and a fat suit is supposed to cause viewers to explode into paroxysms of laughter and is topped only by his appearance in yellow-face as old Mr. Wong. Some of the most egregiously awful jokes fail so badly the first time (broken bed sex Rasputia crammed into her compact car) that theyre brought back for encores. In one way its surprising that the movie is so consistently unfunny. One would assume director Brian Robbins knows a thing or two about humor. After all he directed that pinnacle of comedic excellence The Shaggy Dog. Need I say more?

Norbit Mr. Wrong | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesNorbit Mr. WrongIncredible as it seems we may have to rethink Jackass 2 in light of Norbit  Eddie Murphys latest adventure in latex.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Feb. 9 2007  (out of 4)Starring Eddie Murphy Thandie Newton and Cuba Gooding Jr. Directed by Brian Robbins. 102 minutes. At major theatres. PG  Article Continued BelowIncredible as it seems we may have to rethink Jackass 2 in light of Norbit Eddie Murphys latest adventure in latex.Jackass 2 was the low-water mark for extreme vulgarity prior to Norbit which opens today at undiscerning megaplexes everywhere. But the Jackass boys who seem restrained in hindsight had just a single scene of a morbidly obese woman throwing herself upon a helpless male.Norbit has several such scenes and follows them with additional footage of the flying sow terrifying other unsuspecting individuals with her bikini-clad bulges. Her name is Rasputia played by a fat-suited Eddie Murphy who also happens to play the lisping title character Rasputias timorous husband. Think Big Mommas House blended with a particularly loathsome Jerry Lewis movie and youve got the picture. Grimacing yet?And to think that Murphy volunteered for this gig which he co-wrote with his brother Charles. Yet he had to be persuaded to accept the Dreamgirls role that has him considered a front-runner to win Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards on Feb. 25. Murphy is almost Shakespearean in his tragic inability to spot lemons. He matches great talent with an almost pathological lack of good taste much like the late Elvis Presley during his jump-suited Vegas sell-out years. For every Dreamgirls 48 Hours and Beverly Hills Cop on Murphys resumee there are at least two clunkers of the ilk of The Adventures of Pluto Nash The Haunted Mansion and I Spy.Norbit may well be his worst film - and thats really saying something. It is utterly bereft of honest laughs. Murphy presents so many offensive racial stereotypes along with the usual juvenile yuks about bodily functions its almost as if hes going out of his way to convince Academy voters that it would be foolish to honour him for Dreamgirls a rare good performance.His Norbit is a four-eyed dweeb in the style of one of the lesser creations of Bill Cosby whom Murphy used to savagely skewer. Norbit is born an orphan left at the doorstep of the Golden Wonton Restaurant and Orphanage which is run by a kindly racist named Mr. Wong (played by Murphy yet again adding Asians to his long list of offended parties).The marble-mouthed Norbit grows up and gets himself married against his will to the hyper-aggressive Rasputia a foul-mouthed 400-pounder whose main criterion for a spouse seem be any male who wont complain about being crushed by her.Norbit would really rather be with his orphanage sweetheart Kate (Thandie Newton tragically miscast) but hes too timid to say so. Besides shes about to get married to her fiance Deion (Cuba Gooding Jr. a long way from Oscar) who is far more calculating than he lets on. Unbeknownst to her Deion is involved in an attempt by Rasputias three brothers to turn the orphanage into a strip joint called The Nipplopolis.This brief exposition might give the impression that Norbit actually has a plot. Dont be fooled and ditto for the direction. Whatever guidance was provided by helmer Brian Robbins (The Shaggy Dog) must have been sent by flaming arrows. Theres no discernible intelligence behind this production whatsoever.Saddest of all is the thought that a once-great comic has been reduced yet again to jumping into a rubber suit to get cheap laughs as he has done before. What happened to the Eddie Murphy of Raw the 1987 concert film in which he kept a New York audience in stitches for 90 minutes with nothing more than his jokes and stories?That Eddie Murphy must have been crushed beneath the bulk of Rasputia along with whatever is left of the mans self-respect.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

But mostly he likes fat suits. 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Norbit Comedy. Starring Eddie Murphy and Thandie Newton. Directed by Brian Robbins. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to SFGate.com/movies.) If Eddie Murphy gets an Oscar for ""Dreamgirls"" later this month the deciding factor with voters may be his performance in ""Norbit."" Its much more impressive than anything he does in ""Dreamgirls"" and yet movies such as ""Norbit"" or ""The Nutty Professor"" never get nominated for anything even though they represent some of the best work of an important screen comedian. Its just the way it is. Until the motion picture academy gets with the program and comes up with a special category for comedy voters will have no choice but to continue honoring comedians just for turning somber. [Podcast Mick LaSalle reviews.] So he sings and dances in ""Dreamgirls"" and he looks sad when his producer is mean to him. But does he play a 300-pound woman? Does he play an old Chinese man? ""Norbit"" is a tour de force in which Murphy plays three distinct characters two of them to the hilt. In fact the only thing that makes ""Norbit"" good rather than great is that the title character is a bit bland. Hes caught between Murphys need to make him ridiculous and his function within the script as more or less a romantic lead. So thats the bad news Its not a classic. The good news however has something to do with sitting in a theater laughing out loud for 105 minutes. This is Murphy doing what he does best genial cruelty and good-natured nastiness. His comedy is so obvious that he dares the audience to see every moment coming and then delivers by topping expectations and making his jokes bigger and more ridiculous than anyone could imagine. Youve heard of rapier wit. This is sledgehammer wit wielded with sledgehammer precision. Life has always been cruel to Norbit (Murphy). As an infant he was thrown from a car by his parents and adopted by Mr. Wong (Murphy) the owner of a Chinese restaurant/orphanage. Before he has a chance to come into his own he is taken under the wing of a very fat girl and as soon as he and Rasputia (Murphy) are old enough they marry. Rasputia is the great comic creation of ""Norbit."" For those familiar with Murphys standup work there are echoes here of his descriptions of his maternal aunt an enormous woman whod fall down the steps every Fourth of July and destroy the stairway. The difference is that Rasputia is phenomenally ill-tempered sexually driven and absolutely convinced of her own physical attractiveness. She shows up at a water amusement park wearing a bikini and has to lift up her stomach to show that shes wearing bottoms. This is the level of comedy were dealing with here. If that doesnt sound funny to you youre not the audience. Rasputias obesity is the subject of a number of hilarious sight gags Scenes of her pouncing on her husband demanding physical satisfaction a shot of her going down a waterslide and a running motif of her taking up the whole bed and rolling over her husband. Yet the fat jokes would exhaust themselves were it not for the character work. Murphys eyes his facial expressions as Rasputia her stare the way she carries herself -- all of this is hysterically funny a portrait of someone deluded about herself in every possible way. More than a sight gag Rasputia is a villain someone in stark contrast to the lovely Kate played by Thandie Newton (whose haggardness in ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" was just part of the role). Kate has a handsome fiance (Cuba Gooding Jr.) but she has a rapport with Norbit and he cant help but hope. Its a measure of the effectiveness of this often outlandish film that it builds a strong desire within the audience for Norbit and Kate to get together. As for Mr. Wong it took me two-thirds of the movie to figure out that Murphy was playing him. At first I was wondering who was this very funny Asian actor. I began to catch on when I noticed the movie giving him loads of screen time when I realized he was playing a Chinese man with an absurd Japanese accent and when he began to complain about ""Brack people."" Or to put it another way I caught on he was Murphy when I realized he was too funny to be anybody else. -- Advisory This film contains sexual situations and coarse humor.

Norbit (Eddie Murphy) finds himself up a tree in his relationship with Rasputia (Eddie Murphy) in Norbit. Photo Dreamworks Pictures Norbit 1 / 2 Back to Gallery In Norbit Eddie Murphy assumes four roles. The first is a nerdy schnook with plastic-frame glasses. The second is a Chinese restaurateur/orphanage director with wire-rim glasses. The third is the nerdy schnooks gazillion-pound spouse a role made possible by split-screen sleight of hand and mounds of prosthetic flab. The fourth isnt visible. Its the ghost of Murphys electrifying turn in Dreamgirls a performance that has garnered huge praise and multiple kudos including an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. That role in that film loudly corrected anyone who thought of Murphy as nothing more than a worn-out star in a fat suit a guy whose recent career highlights ran from The Nutty Professor II The Klumps to Daddy Day Care. Sayonara old Eddie. Aloha new Eddie. Norbit reminds us the old Eddie is alive and kicking. It reminds us too that careers are never really planned in Hollywood; they just happen for good or for ill with capricious zigs and zags. Murphy grimacing his way through Norbit is one such zag. He looks like hes in pain and he probably is -- latex cellulite cant be fun to wear -- but his anguish is as much existential as physical trapped inside a lumbering vehicle that offers a morbidly obese harpy as the main comic attraction. Her name is Rasputia a reference to the Russian mystic of notorious beard and ugliness. Rasputia is exceedingly large wears exceedingly polyester clothing (see canary-yellow hot pants) and treats Norbit with exceeding cruelty. He marries her because hes lonely -- he grew up in Mr. Wongs Golden Wonton Restaurant and Orphanage -- and because hes too darned nice to object. Their eventual sexual congress involves slinky outfits (Rasputia in a silk teddy Rasputia in dominatrix leather) and a succession of smashed beds. In the midst of this living hell appears Norbits one true love a slim ethereal being named Kate. Kate (Thandie Newton smiling through her own existential pain) is engaged to a smooth hustler (Cuba Gooding Jr.) whos in cahoots with Rasputias thug brothers (Terry Crews Clifton Powell Mighty Rasta) to turn Mr. Wongs orphanage into a strip joint. Kate unaware of this scheme agrees to a hurried wedding but thereafter spends all of her free time with Norbit. Insert The Graduate cliches here. In the process we hear jokes about fat people driving (Rasputias chest honks the horn) fat people bathing (Rasputia meets Archimedes) fat people bouncety-bouncing (Rasputia catapults blonde girls) and fat people careening down a water slide to the tune of Wagner (Rasputia meets Valkyries). Director Brian Robbins coaxes humor from a few scenes -- I quite enjoyed Katt Williams and Eddie Griffin as blinged-out pimps -- but otherwise lumps together crudities with the same witless pushiness he exhibited in The Shaggy Dog. As Rasputia Murphy hikes up his face into a ghastly countenance and shrieks loudly; one might say he caterwauls. As Norbit he talks through his sinus cavity. As Mr. Wong he channels Mickey Rooneys sham-Chinese landlord from Breakfast at Tiffanys swapping his Ls for Rs (""I dont rike brack I dont rike Jew either"") in a breathtaking display of moronic insensitivity. Speaking of which Whats so funny about thin people pretending to be fat? Are triple-E bosoms with Batman nipples inherently hilarious or are we awed by the knowledge that a skinny Murphy lurks within? Maybe neither. Maybe fake rubber thighs arent funny at all.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post As the Academy Awards approach there are naysayers out there when it comes to Eddie Murphys celebrated performance in ""Dreamgirls."" For this critic though the uncorked glee of Murphys soul man Jimmy ""Thunder"" Early infused the musical with a crazy verve. And the confusion that eclipses Jimmys vibrancy as he loses his place in the pop firmament was touching. But its easy to concede that there are hints of a dismayingly familiar shucking and jiving in the stars turn. Beneath Murphys sweaty fragrant James Brown impersonation one detects whiffs of another of the actor-comics ""SNL"" staples - Buckwheat. And thats not otay. Murphys latest comedy ""Norbit"" opens today. No actor should be denied their earned kudos because he commits a taste crime - a stunningly unfunny one at that. But ""Norbit"" is so balefully bad its hard not to rethink the nominees Oscar run. As he has done in films with varying degrees of charm Murphy endures layers of makeup and fat-suit prosthetics to play a number of characters in this story about an unhappily married man who is reunited with his childhood love. Actually Norbit Albert Rice is more than a miserable spouse. Hes downright abused. His poindexter mouth is frozen in a Joker-like rictus. Only Norbits rigid grin signals his abject acquiesence. As a boy he was saved from bullies at the Golden Wonton Orphanage run by Mr. Wong (Murphy) by a more chilling mass of menace named of Rasputia who claims him as her own. Eternally beholden he marries her. Quicker than you can scream ""I dont. I dont"" Norbit gains not just a wife from hell but three sulfuric siblings. Because a movie even an awful one must create tension the brothers who run the Latimore Construction Co. intend to buy out Wong and make the orphanage a strip club. Norbits first love Kate (Thandie Newton of ""The Pursuit of Happyness"") wants to take over the orphanage where she and Norbit met. Cuba Gooding Jr. mugs admirably as Kates dodgy fiance. In a tradition that now competes with the Brits for men in dresses Murphy - like Martin Lawrence and Tyler Perry - dons drag to depict his hefty female alter ego. While Lawrence and Perry arguably celebrated Big Momma and Madea there is so much contempt in Murphys depiction of Rasputia that hes due for an intervention. ""Norbit"" is a running fat joke with some pimp nonsense (Eddie Griffins Pope Sweet Jesus) stuffed in for good measure. This borderline-PG-13 comedy demands the sort of sociological scrutiny that often has the moviegoer looking for a fun night out rolling her eyes. And granting ""Norbit"" consideration feels like swinging a sledgehammer at a microbe. Still here are some cultural clashes worth noting. At a recent preview packed with folk of color the first big laugh came when Mr. Wong the proprietor of the garish orphanage sees coyotes sniffing the swaddled baby Norbit. ""Another black one"" he mumbles. ""You cant give them away."" Ha ha. A week ago a colleague sent a link about New York high schooler Kiri Davis whose seven-minute documentary called ""A Girl Like Me"" (uthtv.com/ umedia/show/2052) includes a section re-creating Dr. Kenneth Clarks contribution to the Brown vs. Board of Education case in which she asks black children which doll they prefer the white or the black one. ""Can you show me the doll that is the nice doll?"" Davis asks a youngster. He picks the white one. He wasnt alone 15 out of 21 children preferred the white doll. Ha ha. And why spill ink over what Sen. Joseph Biden meant by ""articulate"" when Murphy et al. still try for mileage with this ""So when you answer the phone try sounding white"" a Latimore brother tells Norbit. OK the difference might be similar to who does and does not get to use the n-word but arent we tired of plying such a lame privilege? Recently Murphy told the ""Today"" shows Al Roker he was putting the make-up shtick behind him. Hes one movie too late. Come Monday ""Norbit"" could beat out ""Hannibal Rising"" for the box offices No. 1 spot. But just because audiences commit their own taste crimes with dismaying recidivism doesnt mitigate this cynical undertaking. In a couple of months Donkey Murphys animal ego will bray in the third installment of the ogre franchise. Give me ""Shrek"" over this dreck and Donkey over this asinine outing any day.

"Norbit belongs in the stereotype hall of fame - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Norbit belongs in the stereotype hall of fame Eddie Murphy plays both the nerd Norbit and his overweight wife Rasputia. (bruce mcbroom) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  February 9 2007 A Saturday evening. The phone rings. ""Hello?""""Hey girl.""""Oh hey. Whats going on?""""Nothing. I just saw that Eddie Murphy movie Norbit where he plays both the nerd with an overbite big glasses and a puffy little Afro and the obnoxious fat woman he marries.""""Thats funny I went last night. And Im at a loss. I laughed and all. But it was also dumb and coarse and sometimes boring and a little bit sad. I mean I know Eddie Murphy is a great comedian and Im happy for his Oscar nomination for Dreamgirls and that his careers on a roll again -- and I mean Ill support a brother. But whens he gonna try to do some August Wilson. Cause this Norbit is some seriously regressive -- """"Im feeling you on this. He still doesnt like women.""""Ive been saying that since Delirious. """"This movie belongs in the Black Stereotype Hall of Fame from the three shiftless schemers to the two funky pimps. It is interesting that Eddie decided to play the most offensive characters himself -- the wife Rasputia and the kindly racist Chinese dude who raises Norbit.""""The only recommendable thing about Norbit is that hes not as bad as every other person in this movie. Its like these weird defects in Eddies psychology are OK because he can make entertainment out of them.""""Comedians do that all the time. But his biggest defect is about us. Were not as big as Rasputia but were not dainty either. And this movie is about an evil obese chick. Shes jealous and petty and lazy and greedy and gross and ignorant. Did you see yourself in her? Cause I didnt.""""No. But whats weird is how shes not meant to be a satire on a particular type of person. Shes like just a pure living nightmare the reason why so many men chase Paris Hilton and the Pussycat Dolls. Norbit never loved her. He married her because her no-good idiot brothers -- two bodybuilders and one slick dude -- pretty much force him to. She goes crazy when Thandie Newton shows up playing his childhood sweetheart whos a lot thinner. The dark-skinned fatty versus the fatless hottie. Its Lena Horne versus Ethel Waters all over again.""""Or Dreamgirls. """"Is it me or did it seem like the people making this movie went out of their way to make Thandie look a lot lighter than Rasputia?""""Its not you. They definitely gave her the Barbra Streisand lights.""""It was also like every time Rasputia starts to seem real in an understandable human way like when she tells Thandie shes too thin out of actual jealousy the movie makes her do something stupid in the next scene."" ""Oh like when she torpedoes down that water slide in the bathing suit.""""The joke is never how skinny Thandie is. And Rasputia is right Thandie needs to eat. The joke is how Rasputias exposed celluloid jiggles and how this great big woman is capable of flying through the air with so much ease.""""I was embarrassed for her because she was too dumb to be embarrassed for herself.""""But I was embarrassed for Thandie too.""""What is going on with her? Remember her in The Truth About Charlie? Wheres that movie star?""""I didnt see that movie. But Im always rooting for her. I hate seeing her so shrill and strident like in Crash and in The Pursuit of Happyness.  """"She looked a hot mess in that movie.""""She looked strung out and nuts so Will Smith would look good.""""At least in Norbit shes not crazy.""""But shes an airhead. I mean seriously Who agrees to marry Cuba Gooding Jr. anymore?""""I forgot he was in this movie.""""He plays her golddigger boyfriend.""""What happened to his career?""""Girl we dont have time.""""Well lets get back to my original concern. What are these black comedians doing for us?""""If were not 500 pounds and insane were 50 pounds and stupid.""""Look at Big Momma. Look at Tyler Perry and that Madea character.""""Come on. I like Tyler Perry.""""He doesnt hate women the way it seems like Eddie Murphy does. Ill give you that. But the point is that these men are dictating how normal and big black women play in the movies. I cant think of a woman who would waste her time playing a fat black dude for laughs.""""I dont think our narcissism works that way. If a black woman gets the chance to carry a movie or heaven forbid direct one we wouldnt have time for a frivolous mess like Norbit."" Wed have to make something that matters.""""Thats the worst news of all about these brothers in drag. It means another black woman is out of a job.""""Im convinced if Eddie Murphy had his way. He would have played his part in Dreamgirls and Jennifer Hudsons.""""Dont even go there.""""Well with this movie likely to top the box office when the Oscar polls close on February 20 Eddie should just be glad there are barely any big-boned black women in the Academy to vote for somebody else.""""Mmm hmm. You go Marky Mark""Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/movies/blog.

Thesps fans will flock to this low-ball item that arrives just as hes in the Oscar spotlight -- a coincidence that will only boost early February B.O. Eddie Murphy once again taps into his inner Jerry Lewis -- and his idea of a big fat overbearing wife -- in ""Norbit"" playing a meek hubby and his hopelessly domineering 500-pound-plus wife. Murphy continues his ongoing gambit for playing multiple characters in various shapes sizes and races but his story (conceived with brother Charles) lacks even the basic form that held most of ""The Nutty Professor"" together. Thesps fans will flock to this low-ball item that arrives just as hes in the Oscar spotlight -- a coincidence that will only boost early February B.O. ""Broad"" may be the obvious word to describe the movie but it doesnt begin to suggest its nasty side -- its contemptuous depiction of plus-size African-American women. Narrating his own unfortunate childhood Norbit (Murphy) describes how his parents literally tossed him outside the Golden Wonton Orphanage just after he was born in 1968. Raised by owner Mr. Wong (Murphy again) Norbit becomes close friends with cute little girl Kate (China Anderson) whos then adopted and taken away. Just as orphan bullies are about to cream the shy Norbit hes protected by a hefty 10-year-old girl named Rasputia (Lindsey Sims-Lewis) who effectively wraps him up in her arms and never lets him go. Now the adult Norbit finds himself caught in severe wedlock with Rasputia (Murphy once again) enforced by her three physically intimidating brothers (Terry Crews Clifton Powell Lester ""Rasta"" Speight) who run a shady construction company. More than anything else ""Norbit"" depicts four huge black folks basically terrorizing an all-American town thats somewhat integrated but feels lily-white. The racial politics of this curious situation are bypassed and deflected by Mr. Wong who ultimately admits he hates both blacks and Jews -- while acknowledging that both groups love Chinese food.Norbit may have found his way out of his domestic hell with the return of Kate (whos all grown up into Thandie Newton). A pretty reed of a woman next to the repulsive mound of undulating flesh and boobs that is Rasputia (care of Rick Bakers special effects makeup) Kate offers hope to Norbit until she introduces her fiance Deion (Cuba Gooding Jr.). What Kate doesnt realize is that shes engaged to a con man whos about to work a deal with Rasputias brothers to get hold of Wongs orphanage and turn it into ""a titty bar."" Director Brian Robbins whose specialty is sweet-minded sports movies and most definitely not knee-to-groin slapstick inserts physical set pieces into the predictable romantic comedy storyline that have no flow or comic inspiration. The most that can be managed is a ridiculous number where Rasputia -- in her red string bikini -- takes a ride down a water-park slide and nearly squashes little girls. The more Murphy the actor and writer tries to tap into Lewis the further he gets from what made Lewis best work such a marvel of camera and comedian in tandem. Murphy plays Norbit as mentally slow and even just dumb but it finally doesnt ring true since Norbit like a really smart guy is able to turn the tables on Deion. Where Murphy goes to town is with Rasputia and even the act of wearing what looks like seven layers of flesh makeup doesnt stop him from delivering some of his patented drop-dead expressions. Still its not hard to detect this creature as the object of something like pure hate by four male screenwriters. Comedy like this isnt pretty. Murphys Wong trucks in pure stereotype but at least Newton counters all of this with some recognizably human behavior and vulnerability. Eddie Griffin turns up from time to time as a loud-mouthed pimp. Production is a pro studio product through and through down to the outdoor sets which are obviously studio backlots.

"Stereotypes On Steroids washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Stereotypes On Steroids Eddie Murphy as Norbit right and as Mr. Wong the racist adoptive father tests the waters of political incorrectness. (By Bruce Mcbroom -- Dreamworks Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 9 2007 Viewed through a conventional critical lens ""Norbit"" is just another crass Eddie Murphy comedy. Of cours e the movie -- featuring the toothy comedian as a Chinese curmudgeon a bespectacled goofball and a super-size female harpy called Rasputia -- is crude offensive and shameless. And of course were appalled at those bus posters of Rasputia -- in all her Victorias Secret-y glory -- crushing her hapless weenie husband also played by Murphy. Maybe we should consider instead why films like ""Norbit"" -- Martin Lawrences ""Big Mommas House"" farces and Murphys ""Coming to America"" and ""The Nutty Professor"" come to mind -- are so perennially popular. Could it be these movies amount to mass permission sessions? They give us license to laugh at things on Saturday night wed decry on Monday morning. In the safety of a crowd it seems anything or anyone is fair game. And the more exaggerated the comedy the funnier. And the safer too Surely we quietly reason to ourselves no one is really that fat that geeky or -- and heres where it really gets dicey -- that stereotypically ethnic. With Murphy as the master of ceremonies of ""Norbit"" theres an added measure of license. As the godfather the professor emeritus of P.C.-busting hes been given prerogative to do the outrageous since his 1980s ""Saturday Night Live"" era when he played politically incorrect characters such as a bumbling Buckwheat a Mister Rogers of the hood. But in light of ""Borat"" -- last years big kahuna of political incorrectness -- ""Norbit"" feels artless and callow. Both comedies traffic in stereotypes; the difference is that filmmaker Sacha Baron Cohens knife is smarter and sharper as he speaks to real issues in society. Murphy on the other hand is just playing for laughs; his is sitcom satire rather than social satire. Still the targets of these stereotypes can end up hurting just the same. (The very overweight woman sitting in front of me didnt so much as chuckle during the entire movie.) The movie which follows the misery of Norbit (Murphy) a nerd whos caught between his abusive extremely rotund wife Rasputia (Murphy in fat suit mode) and his beloved childhood sweetheart Kate (Thandie Newton) does have its moments most of them slapstick. There certainly is something funny -- on whatever primitive level -- about Rasputia speeding down a waterslide and breaking infrastructure upon her landing. And its hard not to respond -- with groans if not laughter -- to Rasputia flipping up a roll of tummy fat to prove to the pool attendant shes wearing swimsuit bottoms. As Mr. Wong Norbits adoptive Chinese father Murphy certainly tests the boundaries of political correctness. Outfitted in white latex and jaundice-yellow teeth and speaking in Charlie Chan English hes a bigot who at one point refers to Rasputia as a ""gorilla."" Of course this is Murphys winky-winky aside to the audience Since hes African American he gets to make indirect fun of black people (just as Cohen makes fun of Jewish people). But can he do this as an Asian stereotype whos given to racist invective? (Now were in Spike Lee ""Do the Right Thing"" territory?) Even in the permissive environment of an Eddie Murphy comedy it feels wrong and jarring. ""Norbit"" isnt one of Murphys best a poor cousin to his other multiple-role comedies. As Rasputia whose catchphrase is a brassy ""How you doin?"" hes surprisingly unfunny. Norbit himself is a weak reworking of Jiff Ramsey the socially challenged and funnier character Murphy played in 1999s amusing ""Bowfinger."" And much of the movie -- which Murphy wrote with a small posse of collaborators -- is taken up with the torturously dull not to mention unbelievable romance between Norbit and Kate (a disappointingly lackluster Newton) and the tedious agenda of Cuba Gooding Jr. as a schemer-manipulator. But who knows Boosted by a Golden Globe win and an Oscar nomination for his energetic performance in ""Dreamgirls"" Murphy hopefully will be too busy having his pick of quality projects to even think of making ""Norbit 2."" Norbit (102 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for crude and sexual humor nudity and profanity.

As Norbit an aviator-framed nerd whos like a human punching bag out of the worst urban sitcom of 1974 Murphy speaks in a breathy lisp as if his mouth had been partially buttoned shut and he doesnt give himself the nerds traditional redeeming feature of a geeky slide-rule intellect. Norbit all frozen gawk is just a very dim bulb. He is married for some reason to Godzilla...I mean Rasputia a shrieking scowling terror her limbs dripping with fat played by Murphy with enough head swivels angrily wagged fake fingernails and sassafras ""attitude"" to make Martin Lawrences Big Momma and Tyler Perrys Madea look like the Bronte sisters. (In a smaller role Murphy also plays Norbits adoptive father the unfunny Asian stereotype Mr. Wong.) Yet here once again the character has no glee no happy raunchy devil inside. Shes just a scratchy-voiced monstrosity an excuse for Murphy to strut around wearing the latest in fat-suit technology. Now theres where Norbit is impressive. When Rasputia shows up in a bikini you dont just see the rolls of blubber; you see dimples and stretch marks -- you see cellulite. The spectacle of spilling jiggling flesh served up via the wizardry of Rick Baker is so convincing that it makes a mockery -- an irrelevance -- of Eddie Murphys gifts.
