The D are egregious comic behemoth Jack Black and his buffoonish sidekick Kyle Gass - a comedy rock duo whose music is an ironic mix of hair metal and medieval prog windbaggery. This cartoonish biopic of the band takes the plot of The Blues Brothers and the characters from Bill and Ted and sends them on an acid-fuelled jaunt to find a magic guitar pick fashioned from a chipped tooth of the devil and while Black clings tightly to his School of Rock schtick Gass comes across like an old buddy to whom Black now somehow owes a career. Clearly intended to be viewed through a haze of marijuana smoke itd be against the law for us to recommend this film. So we wont.

"Boisterous Black thrives in the litter of The Pick - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Boisterous Black thrives in the litter of The Pick By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  November 22 2006 Jack Black has only one setting all the way up. And his singing for ""Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny."" is an excuse to slip off your noise-blocking headphones since its the last weapon in his blunt assaultive arsenal he has yet to fully wield at the movies.Its an amazing instrument his voice. Streep-like in its versatility Freddy Mercury-esque in its drama and atomic in its force Blacks voice freakishly refracts a selected history of vocal acrobatics that puts Gilbert and Sullivan and Don Dokken in reasonable aural proximity. He might be the only man alive who could out-belt Christina Aguilera and if Black didnt think being a rock star were a joke hed be one. Instead with his affable tubbier musical sidekick Kyle Gass he tells the joke with hilarious skill as the band Tenacious D.Directed and co-written with the duo by the musician Liam Lynch ""The Pick of Destiny"" recounts with liberties the bands story. Its a gift to the followers whove hung on Gass and Blacks every lick since they were doing guest spots on HBOs ""Mr. Show."" Their movie rewards fans devotion with 90-plus minutes of cruddy stoned adventures that veer from sitcom slacking to an exciting showdown with Satan.I can explain Black and Gass are JB and KG two penniless and uninspired musicians who dream of elusive stardom and copious pot. But they also worry about holding on to their unkempt apartment just off Venice Beach. (""Well pay the rent"" Black says ""with our rock."") One day they notice that their guitar heroes -- Townshend Page Van Halen etc. -- all play with the same pick.They get a tip from Ben Stiller in a Gene Simmons frizz wig that this pick is accursed and sacred. Fashioned from one of the devils teeth the pick has traveled from medieval times to the fingers of Robert Johnson and Angus Young. Now it rests in a rock museum and JB and KG hatch a plot to steal it. Obviously the trip to nick the pick is more a distraction from their fruitless songwriting labors than a solution to them. But their 300-mile journey does afford a nasty cameo from Tim Robbins as a crippled European and a DayGlo musical interlude after JB swallows some forest mushrooms.As a movie its a mess -- and lazy too. Lynch doesnt appear to see the film medium as anything more than a means by which to showcase his stars. A random mashing together of bits and set pieces does not a motion picture make however -- not under the circumstances. Lynch took the same tack in ""Sarah Silverman Jesus Is Magic"" another movie that managed to be funny despite how indifferently it was made.""The Pick of Destiny"" has greatish moments. That rock-off with Satan (who unfortunately appears to be a live-action version of the gay underlord from the ""South Park"" movie) is one. Another is the stellar first 10 or so minutes which are presented as a rock opera the rest of the film never turns out to be. (Surely a ""Tommy"" lurks in Tenacious D -- or at least a ""Kilroy Was Here."")Regardless Black thrives in these grubby environs. His full-throttle bodily chaos makes more sense in movies done on the cheap than in blockbusters and polished comedies like ""The Holiday"" in which he stars next month opposite Kate Winslet. Black and Kevin Smith should be the DeNiro and Scorsese of no-budget. Though Black is a Hollywood star now this movie makes a loud cheerful case for him to return from whence he came.

To second-guess the sound and furious celebration of true rock love? Enjoying the guitar-shredding comedy ""Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny"" one wondered if it shouldnt be the fans of Jack Black and Kyle Gass band Tenacious D that decide how much to celebrate the goofball pleasures and overindulgences of this rock fable about how the band came to be. While there are enough easy gags for the non ""D""-votee one imagines the movie becomes funnier by half (a star) for knowing the back story and music of the popular band. Gass and Black met at Tim Robbins Los Angeles theater troupe and launched the band in 1994. Over the years Tenacious D has opened for Pearl Jam and Beck. In 2001 it had a platinum CD. ""Pick of Destiny"" begins in a pious household in Kickapoo Mo. While his folks and brother gather around the table long-haired Lil JB thrashes and trashes all dining decorum with a song fit for a stevedore. You will not confuse this moment with ""School of Rock."" This 10-year-old headbanger Troy Gentile is a delirious sight lip-syncing Blacks screeching blasphemies. After a hide-tanning JB beseeches a poster of singer Ronnie James Dio who has worked as lead shrieker for Black Sabbath and Rainbow. Dio answers his entreaty. Soon the boy is headed for Hollywood. On Venice Beach JB (Black) discovers his spiritual guide Kyle Gass. The pudgy disdainful sidewalk busker tries to shake off his new fan. Hes a fool to do so especially after JB creates a wickedly amusing song to accompany KGs strumming of Bachs Bourree in E Minor. But thanks to a ""Clockwork Orange""-inspired gang the two become acolyte and guide. Youve guessed it ""Pick of Destiny"" is a ""kitchen sink with InSinkErator"" comedy throwing all manner of pop-culture morsels into its mix. Black Gass and co-writer and director Liam Lynch lavish affection on the subcultures that bubble up around heavy metal. Eric Clapton might be god to some but metal comes from a shadier place. With the help of a Ben Stiller cameo they tease the relationship between the music with the darker arts. Tarot cards introduce different moments in JB and KGs sojourn one that leads them to the Rock and Roll History Museum. Yet for all its satanic verses ""Pick of Destiny"" hasnt a mean moment in it. Just the opposite even when the beast tries to reclaim the guitar pick that many legendary rockers have handled. Not only does director Lynch allows his stars their excesses he has fun of his own. A magic-mushroom sequence is as surreal and colorful as a Teletubbies frolic. ""Pick of Destiny"" has cameos galore Starz Denver Film Festival award recipient Tim Robbins has demented fun playing a crucial role in the guys quest. Meat Loafs turn as the young JBs righteous dad is clever casting. Of course the singers fire-and-brimstone rail against metal is one of the rockingest moments in the movie. Alas there is enough ribald rhyming of the word ""rock"" to earn the movie an R rating. Too bad. Theres nothing heavy about this metal-loving comedy and theres a lot that is good-hearted.

(AP Photo/New Line) In this photo provided by New Line Kyle Gass (KG) and Jack Black (JB) have formed a band the likes of which has never been seen in ""Tenacious D and the Pick of Destiny."" (AP Photo/New Line) Photo New Line Tenacious D a tad more than half baked 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny Comedy. Starring Jack Black Kyle Gass Jason Reed and Tim Robbins. Directed by Liam Lynch. (R. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. To see complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) Most stoner cinema happens accidentally. Its doubtful that Sid and Marty Krofft set out to make ""H.R. Pufnstuf"" appeal to young male slackers who are totally baked on marijuana. And Pink Floyds ""The Wall"" was someones political statement long before it became a midnight movie pothead staple. ""Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny "" on the other hand announces its intentions boldly with a short ""THC The Audience Is Baking"" cartoon at the beginning of the movie -- spoofing those THX sound system ads with that little robot plumber. The next 90 minutes of film includes a talking Ronnie James Dio poster Jack Black dressed as Sasquatch and a high-stakes battle of the bands with Satan himself. The finished product is passable entertainment for sober audiences but comic gold for anyone who is currently stoned has been stoned in the past or spends a lot of time around stoned people. This is the movie that ""Scooby Doo 2 Monsters Unleashed"" should have been. ""Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny "" may not set records at the box office this week but Im betting that concession sales of Milk Duds Red Vines and Junior Mints reach an all-time high. Tenacious D for those who have missed it is a band featuring actors Jack Black and Kyle Gass. Much like the ""Spinal Tap"" guys they lampoon the ironies and histrionics of heavy metal and hard-rock music. Also like Spinal Tap they play their own instruments and really do rock hard -- so theyre actually poking fun and paying tribute at the same time. ""Were going to pay the rent"" Black says during the movie with utmost sincerity. ""With our rock."" ""The Pick of Destiny"" crafts a heavily exaggerated origin story for the band starting with the childhoods of Black and KG. The movie has the pair meeting at Venice Beach in Los Angeles and embarking on a meandering quest for a magic green guitar pick that will make the bearer jam like Van Halen. Black also faces the devil -- played true to the random stoniness of this movie by the Foo Fighters front man Dave Grohl. To outsiders Black has always been George Michael to Gass Andrew Ridgeley in the band. But the characters get equal time in the movie and it turns out that Gass rocks just as hard if not harder. While fans of Black and Gass will be thrilled by their music and antics you can walk in knowing nothing about the band and still be entertained. In effect this is remedial Tenacious D -- with cameos by Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins so mainstream filmgoers wont feel too out of place. As for director Liam Lynchs style the movie actually mirrors the stages of a marijuana high with acts essentially being replaced by symptoms. The first 20 minutes for example are a creative rush -- Black Dio and Meat Loaf tell the story of young JB in rock-opera format -- and funnier than everything that comes afterward combined. The middle is often mind-numbingly slow followed by the trippy ending which is when I suspect everyone in the cast and crew started doing mushrooms. ""Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny "" brings to mind 1980s cult classics such as ""Slap Shot"" and especially the Bob amp; Doug McKenzie movie ""Strange Brew"" where you probably remember all the hilarious parts and forget the occasional stretches of plodding mediocrity. ""The Pick of Destiny"" is a film that will be even more valued once you can view it with a fast-forward button. But its hard to argue with a movie that features our heroes playing a song that rocks so hard someones head literally explodes. Even when the plot seems to be going nowhere Black and Gass are likely to give you the giggles anyway. -- Advisory Whatever youre on when you see ""Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny "" is between you your God and whoever delivers the urine sample to your parole officer. But be warned that this movie contains profanity drug use sexual humor more drug use comic violence and even more drug use. Dude.

Kyle Gass left and Jack Black star in Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny. Photo New Line Cinema As a movie Tenacious D cant beat the band 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The poster for Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny boldly heralds the release of ""the Greatest Motion Picture of All Time"" but rest assured it isnt. Neither is it the worst though it might be a notch closer to the bottom than the top on a scale of cinematic magnitude. Jack Black connoisseurs may debate whether it ranks lower than his flaccid Nacho Libre which didnt employ any ironic braggadocio in its advertising unless you count a heroic image of the star in panties. (Come to think of it maybe you should.) But its a safe bet that hard-core followers of Black heavy metal or Blacks heavy metal will respond to a film that ribs all three. All the cues are there smokin licks. Screechin vocals. Stoner gags. Erection gags. Satan gags. The best gag in the movie if not the Greatest of All Time involves Blacks right butt cheek and Kyle Gass left on which twin domains lie birthmarks of mythical import. Gass is the other half of Blacks band Tenacious D which specializes in broad but loving caricatures of hard-rock cliches a la AC/DC or Black Sabbath (look for Dio in a cameo). A coarsely funny opening sequence visits J.B. as a boy in Kickapoo Mo. where his ramrod parents frown upon his love for the devils music. The whole bit is sung in Tommy-style rock-operatic fervor and for a few minutes I hoped the rest of the film would unspool in snarling recitative. Instead post-credits the cast begins to talk. J.B. carries his kid-size guitar around the country finally arriving in Hollywood sometime in his mid-30s. There he meets Gass who becomes at first a reluctant Pat Morita (""Patience young grass-smoker"") then a partner in the newly formed band Tenacious D. Short on material but long on ambition they resolve to steal a mysterious ""Pick of Destiny"" that has bestowed its demonic power on a long line of metal-slinging gods. Ben Stiller (in one vile wig) tells them where to find it Tim Robbins (in another vile wig) tells them how to steal it and J.B. eats mushrooms that make him hallucinate a dancing yeti. Hair bands and their devotees have been mocked before (Spinal Tap Waynes World) and will be mocked again if only because they seem to mock themselves. The bombast quotient is just too high to resist. A first-rate parody will lampoon this bombast with affection and skill yielding music thats halfway decent enough to sound real. This is true in any genre (including the ""classics"" of P.D.Q. Bach or the opera parodies of the late Anna Russell) but its especially critical for heavy metal in which the distinction between the good stuff and the bad stuff is the difference between party time and aural torment. And the Ds stuff (displayed on a self-titled album and assorted demented music videos) is pretty good notable as much for its musical kick as its bawdy content. Tenacious D video director Liam Lynch (Sarah Silverman Jesus is Magic speaking of bawdy and musical) helmed the film from a script co-written with Gass and Black but a lot of it falls flat. Too many of the songs are truncated -- I wanted to hear more of everything -- and too few are ripped to shreds on screen. A metal-glory daydream in which J.B. blows the top off a guys head is nice but Gass and Black should have been given a few more chances to go completely bonkers. Tenacious D the movie fails to celebrate Tenacious D the band. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Singapore Airlines Fares to Europe and Asia from 499 roundtrip PUMA at eBay for Deals from 2 + free shipping Bass Pro Shops Beat the Heat Sale Deals from 2 + free...

(Its from vintage 70s Loaf that Black cops his popped eyes and matching quivery head shakes.) What makes this one-man mixtape of rock history come to life is that Black is more than just an imitator. Hes still hooked on the teenage muse of his bedroom mirror as he chases down every riff that pops out of his blissed-out id-brain. Hes funny not in spite of his sincerity but because of it. At its loopy dumbass we-dont-need-no-stinkin-budget best Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny works just like a Tenacious D song. The movie feels giddy and eruptive dopily enthralled with itself and more or less made up on the spot especially when it lapses into pure rock opera Meat Loaf as the heros scolding dad in an opening number that might have come out of Tommy; or Black known as JB watching his future partner Kyle Gass strum classical-gas guitar on the Venice Beach boardwalk then adding improvised lyrics to Beethovens ""Fur Elise"" (""If you think its time to f--in rock...""). Then again we also have to endure Tenacious Ds quest for ""the pick of destiny"" a Lord of the Rings guitar pick that legend has it is the tooth of Satan. Its a holy-grail pursuit that keeps stopping the film in its tracks. The Pick of Destiny has its tasty-lick moments like the duos sensationally obscene performance on open-mike night Ben Stillers cameo as a paranoid hippie guitar-store clerk and a musical showdown with the giant red devil himself. But Black a true star and Gass who squeezes more faux-star wattage than youd expect out of his complete lack of star quality are stuck in a movie that could have used a little more ragtag trippiness and a lot less excellent adventure.

With Jack Black Kyle Gass Tim Robbins Ben Stiller. (93 min.)Jack Black is wildly talented and I bow to no one in my admiration for his performance - thats right performance - in ""The School of Rock."" Hes a real actor. But his choice of material leaves a lot to be desired. I can understand his wanting to make ""King Kong"" but ""Nacho Libre"" was a dismal affair and ""Tenacious D"" isnt much better. Black and Kyle Gass started their acoustic/heavy metal rock music comedy act back in the late 1980s. Gold albums and HBO shorts followed now this. Still any movie featuring Jack Black with an appearance by Sasquatch is not a total loss and for those who care we learn the origin of the groups name. The answer is not for the faint-hearted. Grade CSex/Nudity 9 scenes of innuendo/nudity. Violence 6 scenes including child abuse and bullying. Profanity 144 instances including 120 harsh. Drugs/Alcohol/Tobacco 11 scenes including drug use. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The Fountain (PG-13)Director Darren Aronofsky. With Hugh Jackman Rachel Weisz Ellen Burstyn. (93 min.) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 The only startling thing about ""The Fountain"" is the fact that it got made. You certainly cant fault Warner Brothers for playing it safe with this phantasmagoric head-trip flick. On the other hand some risks should be avoided. Just because ""The Fountain"" is different doesnt mean its good. In fact its borderline unwatchable though this hasnt prevented the Oscar buzz from buzzing. Hugh Jackman acting in three separate guises plays a man trying to save his dying wife (Rachel Weisz who in real life is married to Aronofsky). His journey takes him from 16th-century Spain as a conquistador searching for the Fountain of Youth to the 26th century as an astronaut. In between hes a modern-day scientist. Far out man. Grade D+Sex/Nudity 2 scenes; 1 with innuendo; 1 with implied sex. Violence 7 scenes including fights torture and graphic self-flagellation. Profanity 5 instances including 1 harsh. Drugs/Alcohol/Tobacco 1 drinking scene.Still in ReleaseCasino Royale (PG-13)Director Martin Campbell. With Daniel Craig Judi Dench Mads Mikkelsen Eva Green. (144 min.)""Casino Royale"" unveils Craig as the new James Bond and except for Sean Connery hes the best. The new film based on Ian Flemings first 007 book gets back to basics. Although the novel has been updated its still about how Bond debuted as Bond. Craig makes you aware of something that the Bond series in its pursuit of steamy sex and cartoon action quickly lost sight of 007 is a killer. Thats what hes licensed to do. Further evidence of a paradigm shift Bond falls in love with the Bond Girl (Green). Bonds first mission pits him against Le Chiffre (Mikkelsen) banker to the worlds terrorists. By bringing ""Casino Royale"" into the age of global terrorism director Campbell risks turning the Bond franchise into a real-world fright show instead of an escape hatch for our action fantasies. But in the end its still Bond James Bond. Grade B+Sex/Nudity 9 instances including 5 with innuendo and 3 scenes of implied sex. Violence 22 instances including torture and explosions. Profanity 13 mild expressions. Drugs/Alcohol/Tobacco 10 scenes with drinking. Next up Culture Cafe James Bond in SPECTRE Will the new take on an old plot succeed?

"Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; tenacious-d-in-the-pick-of-destiny ) Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Few movies are easier to review or define a recommendation. If youre a die-hard fan of either Jack Black or the band he formed with Kyle Gass youll likely love every moment of Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny. For anyone else the better choice would be to buy the soundtrack (if you like the music) and skip the movie. This is one of those musicals that provides moderate entertainment when the actors are singing or playing guitar but devolves into a spiral of tediousness during the increasingly lengthy gaps between numbers. The comedy is juvenile and often unfunny. There are some laugh-aloud moments but not nearly enough. In the end you have to possess a sweet spot for Black and his antics to find Tenacious D more than barely watchable. The movie is a fictionalized account of how the real band Tenacious D was formed. It uses a comic-book style approach with both JB (Jack Black) and KG (Kyle Glass) coming across as larger-than-life characters. They meet on the streets of Hollywood become mentor-and-pupil (with Black as the latter) in a relationship that intentionally recalls Yoda and Luke. Eventually they agree to play together but to elevate themselves above all the other wannabe rockers they embark upon a quest for ""the pick of destiny"" a guitar pick fashioned out of the devils tooth. It resides in the Rock n Roll History Museum; they must break in and steal it. The musical sequences offer a certain level of appeal and the movie gets off to a quick start because its front-loaded with them. Unfortunately after that things stabilize to where Tenacious D resembles a typical Jack Black comedy. For those who break out in laughter merely looking at Black this movie will scratch an itch. Those expecting him to do something funny will have to judge whether his antics fail or succeed. Most of Tenacious Ds comedy seems aimed at teenagers (jokes about farts and erect penises being primary components). The music makes Tenacious D bearable although its not top notch rock. The lyrics have their subversive and amusing moments which is more than what can be said about the film in general. Directed by Liam Lynch Tenacious D represents a series of peaks and valleys but there are too many of the latter and they last too long. The climax is suitably-over-the-top and oddly reminiscent of the 1979 tune by The Charlie Daniels Band ""The Devil Went Down to Georgia."" Its a comic book ending to a comic book movie (albeit not a very good one). My advice set aside the money you would have spent on a ticket toward buying the soundtrack. That way you can get all thats moderately good about Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny without having to endure the substantial bad.

Comments Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny Since the late 90s Jack Black has teamed with Kyle Gass in the comedy-rock duo Tenacious D and their short-lived HBO series led to Blacks breakout role in High Fidelity. Now that hes a movie star Black has invested some of his capital in this big-screen outing though the format magnifies the disparity between the two performers. Blacks love of heavy-metal pomp animates the giddy opening sequence a rock opera with cameos by Meat Loaf and Ronnie James Dio and a few choice gags pop up later (asleep on a park bench Black is menaced by Alex and his droogs from A Clockwork Orange). But most of the movie about the search for a magical guitar pick farts along at the level of a ""Waynes World"" sketch. Liam Lynch (Sarah Silverman Jesus Is Magic) directed. R 97 min. By J.R.

Theaters would be wise to disarm smoke detectors for showings of ""Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny"" a kind of origin story for the self-anointed ""greatest band on Earth"" starring Jack Black and Kyle Gass. Not surprisingly the pic struggles at times to flesh out even its relatively brief 90-odd-minute duration but it delivers some genuine if generally low-brow laughs along the way. An avid cult of ""D"" devotees should ensure a respectable opening (though probably not equal to Blacks recent outings) and sweet licks in DVD release where mood-enhancement aids will be all but compulsory. Black and Gass created the duo a dozen years ago mixing a knowing sense of hard rocks sound and fury with wild and humorous lyrics. In between there has been a short-lived HBO program bestselling CD and raucous live shows. As a feature the vibe is very much akin to a live-action Beavis and Butt-Head complete with the incumbent challenges of stretching a limited concept into a theatrical format. Several cameos help (including exec producer Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins whose Actors Gang troupe was where ""D"" began) but only the most ardent fans wont find themselves studying their watches once in awhile. Directed by Liam Lynch (who helmed the concert film ""Sarah Silverman Jesus Is Magic"" and shares script credit with Black and Gass) the story opens with Blacks young JB fleeing his Christian upbringing (singer Meat Loaf an inspired choice appears as his dad) for Venice Beach to pursue his dream of rock godhood. Soon he encounters guitar virtuoso KG (Gass) and after a run-in with ""A Clockwork Orange""-like quartet of hooligans (will anyone in the target audience get that gag? Unlikely) KG takes JB in and puts him through a training regimen infused with ""Kung Fu"" overtones. Pic meanders a bit as the two bond over bong loads and plot to win an open mic competition to pay the rent. They then learn of a magical guitar pick that could inspire the masterpiece they yearn to create at which point the action kicks into a caper mode as they steal the pick from a rock museum. This is followed by a gratuitous car chase thats either an appeal to ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" crowd or simply an attempt to pad out the narrative. As the more accomplished performer of the two Black carries much of the comedy load and frankly theres more of him here than the average viewer would want to consume in one sitting. Nevertheless many of the lyrics are funny including a closing-credit claim that ""our movies better than Citizen Kane."" Not hardly but give credit to Lynch and his design team for creating the free-wheeling look which includes an extended if somewhat cheesy fantasy sequence after JBs meal of organic mushrooms. (The film has yet to be rated but given the ample drug use profanity flatulence and graphic depiction of the skill that doing ""cock push-ups"" develops it will surely be rated ""R."") For Tenacious D acolytes the movie has been long in coming and the appetite for the related CD should be healthy. In terms of comedies aimed at the dazed and confused ""Tenacious D"" is hardly the pick of the litter but it litters enough laughs in its wake to do more than just blow smoke.
