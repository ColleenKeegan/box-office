As a TV news director (Sigourney Weaver) marshals her cameras a shot rings out and the leader of the free world crumples to the ground. What just happened? Lets rewind... before you can say Rashomon were seeing the same events from another perspective (the Presidential POV) then another (veteran bodyguard Dennis Quaid) and even eventually from the vantage point of the perpetrators. Sounds fascinatingly ambiguous no? Well it might have been if the film had been made 35 years ago but one simple truth emerges murderous Arab extremists wont escape US intelligence forces not even in a high-speed car-chase down narrow side-streets lined with cafe tables. Although mounted with no little efficiency by director Pete Travis (who previously made the TV drama-doc Omagh) the narrative enterprise actually hides a one-dimensional world view with civilian casualties mere background set dressing. Crass indeed.

This film is very very good. Its sharp original and extremely fast passed. In a nutshell itaEUR(tm)s a single event covered from the perspective of people involved within it. This is a aEUR~24aEUR(tm) style in a single movie. This must have been extremely difficult to put together aEUR"" give the editor an Oscar. As for the stupid comments on the acting itaEUR(tm)s was never written to win Oscars itaEUR(tm)s all about the story. This basically revolves around the assignation of the President of the United States. ItaEUR(tm)s not what the film makers did it was all about how they did it and they did it stunningly well. Every perspective act left a big question at its climax. It was all brought together with no loose ends? Was the end weak? No. I was very satisfied that Denis Quads character once again saves the day. What was wrong with that? It was set-up right at the start of the film to end that way. This film is beautifully shot and the style enhanced the sense of urgency and drama. If you like car chases this has one of the best ones I have ever seen. It reminded me of those in the Borne films.

By David Denby Forest Whitaker and Dennis Quaid in a thriller shown from several points of view.   Credit ROBERT RISKO One of the things that moviemakers dream of is the excitement of capturing the sheer flux of life the interaction of many motions large and small--say a mass of people surging forward (in war revolution or just getting to work) and within that mass the movements of a few individuals (lovers murderers executives late for an appointment). So heres a complex sequence of events featuring as much flux as any director could desire the President of the United States is giving a speech in a public square in Salamanca Spain; an assassin plugs him from a window across the square; a bomb goes off underneath the speakers platform; men and women all with some mysterious intent of their own barrel through the general confusion while panicked people by the hundreds stream into the surrounding streets among them terrorists and American Secret Service agents racing after them. Now considered merely as story material ""Vantage Point""--a new thriller that records all this--is sub-Tom Clancy stuff. The terrorist plot at the center of the movie is not even marginally plausible; the characters are stick figures--either loyal and brave defenders of the President or swinish swarthy bad guys. Considered as a piece of storytelling however ""Vantage Point"" is something remarkable--the ultimate case perhaps of a movie as a big whirling machine. The writer Barry L. Levy and the director Pete Travis a Brit who made a TV movie about a bombing in Northern Ireland may be taking their cues from genre fiction but no one can say that they havent beautifully mapped out their turf as a grid of charged vectors. To get everything in the filmmakers use a theme-and-variations structure. We see the events from beginning to end six times first from the point of view of a TV-news crew reporting the speech and then through the eyes of a Secret Service agent (Dennis Quaid) a tourist who gets mixed up in the mess (Forest Whitaker) the President (William Hurt) two of the terrorists (Said Taghmaoui and Edgar Ramirez) and so on. The movie is intended as an homage to Kurosawas ""Rashomon"" but really its quite different. In ""Rashomon"" the varying accounts of a rape and murder are shaped by self-interest. ""Vantage Point"" is more literal; it shows what each person actually sees not what he wants to see. In each depiction we get a little closer to comprehension of the entire affair only to have the film-makers--in a rather cheap trick--cut away to still another characters restricted view of things. Finally they abandon the vantage-point experiment shift to an impersonal view and finish the story in a conventional way. Like so many other thrillers this one ends in a series of car crashes and shootouts. Is it art? Not remotely. But up to the final scenes its a tremendous piece of engineering. After all the narratives have to synch up visually which cant be easy to manage. And the hurtling force of ""Vantage Point"" is fun to watch. But something more than excitement is at stake. Like mystics or ancient philosophers we long to perceive the secret and idiosyncratic pattern within chaos the singular currents running through the tumultuous sea. We are denied this in life since we can never recall everything in an event happening around us no matter how many times we replay it in our heads. Levy and Travis though have pulled this off. They inject some small human touches into the action--Dennis Quaids frowning determination Forest Whitakers natural empathy William Hurts self-amusement mixed with gravity--but all that feels like decoration. The soul of this new machine is the machine itself. Who is the greater hero the morally intransigent man who refuses all compromise with evil or the trimmer who partly collaborates with an oppressor in the hope of keeping himself and others alive? These are hardly the freshest questions in the world but ""The Counterfeiters"" which was written and directed by Stefan Ruzowitzky--whose Austrian grandparents were Nazi sympathizers--makes the old quandaries vibrantly new. This sombre-looking but emotionally commanding movie (the Austrian nominee for the best foreign-language-film Oscar) celebrates two real-life figures of very different temperament. The central character is based on Salomon Smolianoff--known in the movie as Salomon Sorowitsch or Sally (Karl Markovics)--the most talented counterfeiter in prewar Berlin and also a bon vivant ladies man cynic and opportunist; in brief a happy criminal. In the film Sally a Russian-born Jew is arrested in 1936 and later sent to Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria where he survives for five years by painting Nazi kitsch--portraits of S.S. families and the like. In 1944 hes transferred to another camp Sachsenhausen near Berlin and placed at the head of Operation Bernhard--a counterfeiting workshop run by the S.S. and staffed by Jewish prisoners skilled as printers and graphic artists. The Nazi plan is to produce enormous amounts of authentic-looking British and American currency dump it on the market and undermine the economies of those countries. Sallys unit produces the British pound in bulk but his perfect design for the dollar is sabotaged by a Communist printer in the group Adolf Burger (August Diehl) a fiery anti-Nazi who cant bring himself to help the German war effort. In Sallys eyes Burgers morality is impeccable but the noble printer could get them all killed. ""The Counterfeiters"" is devoted to Sallys gift for survival--his way of using his wits to keep the group together and to prevent Burger from attaining the martyrdom he appears to long for. The movie is based on a book by Burger who more than sixty years later is still alive. But theres little doubt who the true hero of the story is. Shooting the film at the rebuilt Babelsberg studio just outside Berlin Ruzowitzky re-created the forgers special quarters in Sachsenhausen--a privileged playpen where the inmates are fed and housed decently and given a Ping-Pong table for ""pleasure."" The director assumes that we dont need to see what else went on in the camp. Perhaps thirty thousand people died there and sounds of the camps normal activities eerily break through the walls of the forgers compound. In all the situation of the counterfeiters is similar to that of the British prisoners building a bridge for the Japanese in ""The Bridge on the River Kwai."" They get to practice their craft which keeps their morale up and even provides them with a little joy. Yet some of them are also sick with shame--the clothes they are given to wear by the S.S. have been taken from the dead. Ruzowitzkys cinematographer Benedict Neuenfels shot the movie largely with a handheld camera and always from the point of view of the forgers who live and flourish only at the sufferance of the S.S. An officer named Herzog (Devid Striesow) a Nazi of ambiguous intentions--hes a protector and a potential executioner--treats Sally as both a genius and a worm and Sally silent furtive and willing to accept humiliation plays at servility. As the movie tells it its precisely Sallys faking and his criminal abilities that work for him in the camp. Karl Markovics has a narrow hatchet face--aggressive but guarded--and a glint in his eye. The movie keeps us close to him and we learn with increasing admiration how his mind works. ""The Counterfeiters"" is a testament to guile. Ruzowitzky scored the picture with tangos and the tangos are meant to be Sallys music--seductive insolent triumphant. Ryan Reynolds the mild-eyed TV actor is perhaps too recessive for starring roles in the movies. In the new romantic comedy ""Definitely Maybe"" he plays a young man who cant decide which of three women he wants. His character Will Hayes is meant to be a little lost but the performance itself is tentative and physically inert; its as if Reynolds thought that any display of sexual swagger would turn Will into a cad--a misconception that almost any old movie star could have argued him out of. Yet ""Definitely Maybe"" which was written and directed by Adam Brooks has charm and spirit. The movie is set in Manhattan during Bill Clintons first Presidential campaign and the years afterward a period in which Wills ambitions and romantic mishaps are plotted against the Presidents troubles with women and the disillusion that overtook the later Clinton period. At the request of his smart little daughter Maya (Abigail Breslin) Will recounts his love life though he changes the names so that Maya cant tell which of his three girlfriends will turn out to be her mother. For us the best part of the tale is not finding out which woman he marries; the interest lies in the women themselves. Elizabeth Banks a slender cheerful blonde plays a Midwesterner with a sense of honor so highly developed that she argues herself out of happiness; Isla Fisher short with thick auburn hair is a changeable free spirit who keeps Will--and maybe herself--off balance; and Rachel Weisz in her strongest movie work to date is shrewd flirtatious and stunningly untrustworthy as an ambitious journalist. In serious roles Weisz can be stiff-backed and righteous but here doing comedy she appears to be a major actress eager to reveal everything shes been holding inside.

While the title trailer and commercials imply that well be carefully piecing together clues to a complex assassination attempt as seen from several perspectives the final product turns out to be a tepid thriller that promises more than it delivers. CLIP Gain some perspective on Vantage Point Things start out promisingly enough. The U.S. president (William Hurt) is attending a global summit on terrorism in the scenic Spanish city of Salamanca. We see a bit of what leads up to his appearance on the dais then suddenly hes shot. We see the same events from the distinctly different angles of eight people in attendance and at first are caught up in catching every nuance and gesture that might provide a clue to the source of the shots. But the movie abandons its premise about halfway in and devolves into a long and rather badly edited car chase. On top of that quite a few loose ends are left dangling. The various viewpoints dont quite link up. And they all employ the same rewind technique once unspooled. Stylistically this laying out of the facts then speedily going back over them in reverse seems initially intriguing but it gets old after about the fifth time. And when motivations are unclear the filmmakers turn to such well-worn cliches as surprise explosions or endangered children to amp up the tension. The positions we have access to include views from the camcorder of Forest Whitaker an American tourist; the watchful eyes of a Secret Service agent (Dennis Quaid); and the combined cameras feeding in to a TV news producer (Sigourney Weaver). Weavers role while small feels glaringly artificial. She entreats a reporter and photographers to focus on the summit not the protesters whom she calls ""the sideshow."" That undermines her credibility as a newsgatherer because protesters are an important part of a news event too. Also hard to buy is Quaids ridiculously indestructible Secret Service man. Like too many action-adventure movies that are short on plot intricacies but long on gimmick and explosives too much is given away in the trailer. In fact one gets a powerful feeling of deja vu when watching the movie. The ads seem to imply we have to be paying close attention to every nuance and they cleverly prime moviegoers to sit up straighter and watch more closely. But ultimately that aspect is oversold. We dont feel terribly challenged or even seriously engaged. Audiences would probably find it more entertaining and stimulating to watch a rerun of TVs 24.

Jones left and Dennis Quaid are shown in a scene from Columbia Pictures ""Vantage Point"". (AP Photo/Columbia Pictures Daniel Daza)  NO SALES  Photo Daniel Daza Review Vantage Point doesnt add up 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Vantage Point Drama. Starring Dennis Quaid William Hurt and Forest Whitaker. Directed by Pete Travis. (PG-13. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) ""Vantage Point"" has a fractured and frustrating narrative. It presents a colossal terrorist attack in Spain in which two bombs go off and the president of the United States is shot. We see this happen once and then the clock is wound back and we see the same events happening again and again each time from the perspective of another character. There should be a reason for filmmakers to tell a story in this way and for a while the temptation is to look for one. For example if all the recollections contradicted each other then the movie could be a commentary on the faultiness of memory particularly in recollecting moments of crisis. Like ""Rashomon."" In the case of ""Vantage Point"" the basic facts are never in dispute but even then theres a willingness on the part of the viewer at least for a while to let director Pete Travis and writer Barry Levy have their fun. The expectation is that surely the movies plot is a fantastic and intricate construction best revealed in this strange and splintered way. But no. Not really. When everything is finally revealed the story ""Vantage Point"" tells is fairly pedestrian and nothing special is gained from all the stopping and restarting. The title is the tip-off. Aside from the changing-perspectives device ""Vantage Point"" has nothing going on. Theres no artistic philosophical or even jolly entertainment reason for adopting this strategy. Its just arbitrary a gimmick. Of course a fun gimmick would have been fine - a fun gimmick is good enough. But the gimmick in ""Vantage Point"" is not fun at all. This is what its like The movie gets you engrossed in the problems of particular characters and their situation. The segment builds to a crisis - and then just when things are getting dramatic the screen freezes. The previous action starts playing backward in super-fast motion and a digital clock rewinds about 20 minutes. The next thing we know were being introduced to another set of characters that we either dont know or dont care about. This is not a problem the first time it happens. The second time its mildly annoying but acceptable. By the third time its irritating. By the fourth time its maddening and by the fifth time. ... Actually by then the pain is gone along with any hope. William Hurt is the president in Spain to promote an international treaty to combat global terrorism. Dennis Quaid plays a Secret Service agent back on the job and a little shaky after having been recently shot by a would-be presidential assassin. Forest Whitaker is just a guy in the crowd an American with a camera. Each gets his turn to be the focus of the movies attention and so do various cops and conspirators and Sigourney Weaver who is effective in a feature role as a TV news director calling the shots live. ""Vantage Point"" is at its best in the early going when it focuses on the Secret Service agent whom Quaid plays with the intensity of a man trying to blast through doubt and fear by staying very very angry. Quaid is so good that his performance ends up promising what the script cant deliver - a blazing portrait of an American professional the sunburned man of action whose inner torment cant stop him. He makes the movie seem like its going to be about a particular guy a particular kind of guy. When that promise fades theres still hope that the movie is going to be about interesting things happening but no action in the movie is more dramatic than the depicted terrorist strike as it turns out. Thats a problem. The audience waits and waits for the dreaded flashbacks to end and then finally when the movie gets past showing the same 20 or 30 minutes over and over theres nothing of compelling interest to see. We just get a climax thats flat and far-fetched. Oh and that Secret Service agent who was so interesting in the early minutes? He becomes just another guy in a car chase. -- Advisory Graphic violence over and over. To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies listen to his weekly podcast at sfgate.com/podcasts.

Kennedys murder -- and even so those who were alive when a young loner fired at Ronald Reagan can remember the conflict the contradictions the absolute chaos of the immediate aftermath. ""Vantage Point"" puts all of that dizzying drama onscreen. Its setup is fictional -- an American commander in chief abroad in Spain to deliver a speech and inaugurate a new anti-terrorist alliance. Its a gutsy choice of venue given that nations own struggles with extremists and as it turns out a foolhardy one -- the president is attacked and several bombs set off to cover up the crime. Parallels to the recent Bhutto assassination are accidental -- but chillingly real. The movies structure meanwhile is clever -- the same story successively told from eight angles. We begin with the supposedly objective view of a cable-news crew then progress through the perspectives of a Secret Service agent an American tourist a Spanish security agent and others. Each story gives us another piece of the puzzle. And then the film rewinds and begins the story again. The cast has plenty of familiar faces -- William Hurt as the chief executive Sigourney Weaver as the TV director Dennis Quaid as the heroic agent Forest Whitaker as the tourist (because its the law -- every ensemble movie has to have a part for Forest Whitaker). Plenty of unfamiliar faces too including the scarily hard-to-read Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer as a duplicitous mystery woman. Unfortunately Barry Levys script like so many of the recent movies that have played with points of view and rival truths -- ""Redacted"" ""Before the Devil Knows Youre Dead"" even ""Diary of the Dead"" -- doesnt always follow through on its own ideas or even play by its own rules. Some of the characters -- particularly Whitakers tourist who joins a dangerous police chase just so he can keep living out some Zapruder fantasy -- seem slightly unlikely. Some sequences although ostensibly following one character show us things he or she couldnt have seen. (During its long climax the film gives up this device entirely.) Yet the more standard thriller elements -- a horrible crime a few double-crosses and chases and a race to catch the villains -- unfold quickly and effectively. Hurt makes the most of his few scenes as an American president who refuses to blindly answer violence with violence (yet is perfectly capable of defending himself when the attack is personal). Quaids clenched-jaw heroics make this the best Secret Service recruitment film since ""In the Line of Fire."" And director Pete Travis -- whose lauded ""Omagh"" looked at a real-life political attack in Northern Ireland -- keeps things grim and gritty and moving. If youre one of Alfred Hitchcocks least favorite moviegoers -- ""the Plausibles"" he called them -- you may spend your drive home from the theater questioning some plot twists and puzzling over who did what to whom and why. But while youre watching -- and the film has one of those hairpin car chases that have been de rigueur for Euro-thrillers since ""Ronin"" -- you wont have time to do anything but sit on the edge of your seat. And maybe if youre old enough remember how shocking and confusing and deeply unnerving a crime like this can really be. Ratings note The film contains violence and strong language.

Once it gets going (about halfway through) this presidential-assassination whodunit throws in enough hurtling bodies screaming bullets and totaled cars that it at least holds your interest so it passes the worth-watching-if-youre-stuck-on-an-airplane test. Down here at sea level though its unlikely to be your best option (unless the rest of the screens at the multiplex are showing ""Fools Gold"" and ""Jumper""). William Hurt plays the president; hes in Spain to deliver a speech and also take a couple of bullets from an assassin hidden somewhere in the unruly crowd. Then a bomb goes off. The how and why of these five minutes of chaos are the subject of the entire first half of the movie. The event is shown and reshown and re-reshown from the point of view of various characters from a Secret Service man (Dennis Quaid) who is still twitching from the bullet he once took for POTUS to a TV news director (Sigourney Weaver) monitoring the speech in a van to a tourist (Forest Whitaker) recording the speech on his video camera. With each retelling the story advances a bit farther. It hits a supposed cliffhanger (every so often someone peers into a video monitor showing images of the shooting exclaiming ""Oh my God"" as we wonder what he just saw) and rewinds to the beginning to start over from a different angle. The film is tremendously pleased with its structure but it has no answer to the charge that a big chunk of it is reruns of earlier scenes. The blur of personnel - a dozen or so shuffle in and out of the action - is meant to keep you guessing and to a point it does Is the guy in the beard for instance a good guy a terrorist or a red herring? But too much attention is given to some people and far too little to others. We learn that Whitakers tourist is having problems with his marriage; under the circumstances this is like being told that the man with the umbrella on the Grassy Knoll in Dallas suffered from athletes foot. The key person behind the conspiracy isnt given a motive or a back story so the revelation of his or her role in it doesnt have any impact. Chugging forward and chundering back the movie keeps promising to whip up something hellishly complicated but what keeps the movie going for an hour and a half is not a complicated plot but a stingy way of dribbling out information. The conspiracy which turns out to span three continents and involve more players than the USC marching band leads nowhere interesting. Moreover the central twist that constitutes the sole memorable detail of the whole scramble is both absurdly far-fetched and ultimately irrelevant since it doesnt surprise the people its meant to. And one key character simply disappears seemingly forgotten by everyone including the screenwriter. The ending doesnt pay off - unless this is some sort of meta-production that intentionally leaves more unanswered questions than the Warren Commission report. Maybe its meant to set up a sequel in which eight different producers screenwriters and studio execs hash out the mysterious box-office death of this movie - and the motive of the critics who assassinated it.

Borrowing the narrative structure from Stanley Kubricks 1956 noir gem ""The Killing"" (re-used by Quentin Tarantino in 1991s ""Reservoir Dogs"") the crime is told and retold from the perspective of a half-dozen witnesses plotters and innocent bystanders. Its kaleidoscopic format -- a hailstorm of flashbacks alternate angles and visual echoes -- turns standard action fare into stylish savvy entertainment. A visit by U.S. President Ashton (William Hurt) to an antiterrorism conference in Spain offers the bad guys just the opportunity they desire for an earthshaking counterstrike. At a photo op in a crowded plaza shots are fired Ashton goes down Secret Service agents Dennis Quaid and Matthew Fox take off after the villains an explosion rocks the scene and chaos erupts. Sigourney Weaver jaw agape in shock plays a TV news director whose on-the-spot editing decisions are a crash course in writing history on the fly. We see how images that she deliberately omits (anti-Ashton demonstrators) and others that she instinctively throws on the air (fire stampeding crowds casualties) become a messy first draft of the tragedy. We get only so far into the story before the film cuts to an earlier part of the day. We follow a Spanish policeman (Eduardo Noriega) as he arrives in the public square butts heads with the American security men then chases two assassins to a tense showdown; once his part in the story is over we cut to American tourist Forest Whitaker cheerfully videotaping the excitement before the presidents arrival and so on. Breaking down the story withholding information and giving every character a parallel chapter creates an intricate framework of suspense. But this is hardly the only reason to watch ""Vantage Point."" Irish TV director Pete Travis (a colleague of ""United 93"" and ""The Bourne Supremacy"" director Paul Greengrass) is a whiz at creating battleground carnage that stops just this side of gruesome reality. He supplies all the necessary genre thrills -- tire-smoking car chases running gun battles in the streets and a satisfyingly high body count -- while evoking powerful work from his cast. There is extraordinary depth of feeling in Whitakers shell-shocked performance Quaid makes his bodyguard a machine tooled for action and Hurt swiftly sketches a commanding commander-in-chief; only the terrorist mastermind and his femme fatale seem like stock figures from a spy novel. Grounding the inventively structured story in a degree of human reality keeps it from spiraling into jump-cut frenzy. While its no classic ""Vantage Point"" is well worth a look.

Photo Daniel Daza Vantage Point 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Its high noon in Salamanca Spain. The President of the United States is arriving in a large city plaza to deliver the keynote speech in the kick-off of a groundbreaking international anti-terror summit attended by 150 world leaders. A teeming throng crowds the plaza flags wave cameras roll. The mayor of Salamanca delivers a welcome as U.S. secret service agents nervously scan the crowd. The president approaches the podium raising both arms in salutation and triumph. Then crack a gunshot. Crack another gunshot. The president goes down and a bearded man in a white shirt bolts across the stage. A small boom followed by mayhem. Then a monstrous boom followed by more mayhem as a bomb explodes inside the plaza. The smoke clears to reveal a horrific expanse of blood and broken bodies and its clear that hundreds - maybe thousands - have died. Ambulance sirens and wails of agony pierce the aftermath. Now ask yourself Doesnt that sound like a fun time at the multiplex? Before you collapse from post-9/11-depressing-movie fatigue (and by the way you really should see In the Valley of Elah) consider the tingles of excitement to be found in a nice straightforward good old-fashioned geopolitical conspiracy thriller with no pretentions. Vantage Point is nothing but a potboiler but there is room in this world for potboilers - especially intelligent and well-structured potboilers that grab us by the hair and send us flying. This is a very crafty film with a very kick-butt car chase. And sometimes thats all we need from the cinema a concentrated dose of adrenaline. In the hands of lauded British TV director Pete Travis (Henry VIII) and screenwriter Barry Levy Vantage Point functions as a Euro-centric 21st-century Rashomon minus swords. Every few scenes or so the movie ""rewinds 21 minutes to that same fateful noon and retells the events from a new perspective. In this manner it cranks through multiform points of view television journalists covering the summit (Sigourney Weaver and Zoe Saldana); the secret service men assigned to the president (Dennis Quaid and Matthew Fox); the mysterious white-shirted running man (Eduardo Noriega); the tourist who films the whole thing (Forest Whitaker); the president himself (William Hurt); and assorted terrorists. This could get tedious fast. It doesnt - thanks to the films airtight (or close to it) logic and attention-deficit pacing which means that any existing plot holes whoosh past too fast to notice. I did not feel encouraged to think while watching this movie. I did however feel encouraged to gasp in amazement whenever cinematographer Amir Mokri hyper-zoomed on someones eyeballs (theyre staring; I get it) and gasp in shock at the plot twists some of which were stupidly and unnecessarily blown in the trailer. Ninety percent of the movie is utterly effective though I will admit to laughing for all the wrong reasons at Matthew Foxs character arc. Good actor meets ill-fitting role. The rest of the cast acquits itself just fine in a film that doesnt allow much room for actorly flourishes. Hurt is vacantly presidential and Whitaker is splendidly warm while Quaid harks back to Clint Eastwoods bone-weary presidential bodyguard from In the Line of Fire. Everyone utters every line as though the fate of the world depended on it. ``We have to be better than this says a politico near the end and he says it with all due solemnity. But I have to disagree they dont have to be any better than this. Neither does the movie. For what it is its more than good enough. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals SanDisk 128GB Cruzer Glide USB Flash Drive for 20 + pickup at...

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Crash Bang Boom goes the action in ""Vantage Point."" Though not necessarily in that order. A final-act car chase with its collateral smash-ups dents director Pete Travis taut if gimmicky thriller some. But before it swerves toward action boilerplate ""Vantage Point"" makes nice use of the heft of Dennis Quaid Forest Whitaker William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver in a story in which an assassination followed by an explosion gets revisited from eight points of view. Top billed but by no means top banana Quaid plays a tense-jawed Secret Service agent. Thomas Barnes is just back from a long recuperation after taking a bullet in the line of fire when hes called to be part of the detail protecting the president in Spain. President Ashton (Hurt) is there to announce a landmark alliance in the war on terror. RATING | Political Thriller When first we see Barnes hes eating pills moving gingerly looking worried. Some agents doubt hes ready though not Kent Taylor (Matthew Fox). Standing on the podium Barnes sees a flutter in a window. So too does American tourist Howard Lewis (Whitaker) who thinks he may have caught the events on his video camera. In the minutes between the shot fired and the blast Lewis calls his wife and children back home. The director makes poignant use of that moment finding fatherly love and human vulnerability in Whitakers looming frame drooping eye strained voice. Weaver plays a TV producer in bickering battle with a headstrong reporter (Zoe Saldana) about how to cover the event. ""Were here for the summit not the sideshow"" she barks at her reporter. ""Not everybody loves us"" the reporter reminds her producer. Are the cherry-picked celebrants inside the plaza more real than the protesters calling the U.S. president a warmonger? When the shot comes their heated exchanges turn briefly touching before coming to an abrupt silence. Chaos ensues -- over and over again. And each time the plume of debris creeps toward a camera gazing down on the plaza the action begins again. A new version brings fresh angles. Most shouldnt be revealed here. Who is that Spanish cop really? What is his relation to a seemingly amorous couple saying goodbye on the edge of the crowd? Who is the stranger (Edgar Ramirez) who pleasantly engages the American tourist who accidentally topples a little girls ice-cream cone? It would be unhelpful however not to tell you that when the terrorists strike the real Ashton is sequestered in a nearby hotel with his advisors (Bruce McGill and James Le Gros) who are trying to compel him to order a first strike in Morocco. ""Vantage Point"" makes some compelling points about media political will national arrogance. But the screenplay lacks the fortitude to delve into all the points of view it teases. The motivation of the terrorists remains murky. And a gunmans motivations (French actor Said Taghmaoui) arent as they seem. It feels slightly chicken too to have cast Israeli star Ayelet Zurer (""Munich"") as the female terrorist. None of this dilutes the adrenaline rushes. Travis keeps things moving. But better directed than written ""Vantage Point"" starts from a position of strength only to race through the streets of Salamanca Spain toward a foregone conclusion.

"Would-be thriller has some major disadvantages - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsReal EstateLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review Would-be thriller has some major disadvantages From left Forest Whitaker Dennis Quaid and Matthew Fox star in an action movie that shows events from several characters perspectives. (Daniel Daza) Email|Print| Text size - + By Ty Burr Globe Staff / February 22 2008 ""Vantage Point"" reduces global terrorism to a Rubiks Cube suitable for an evenings entertainment. If that doesnt make you vaguely ill by all means take this thriller for the shallow gimmicky ""ride"" it aspires to be. You can marvel at the cluelessness of Hollywood writers and directors later.The gimmick in question is the old ""Rashomon"" trick - repeating the action through the perspectives of different characters - updated to an age of post-9/11 dread. The setting is Salamanca Spain where US President Ashton (William Hurt) is about to open a peace conference with a speech in the Plaza Mayor. We watch the ensuing developments from the news truck of producer Rex (Sigourney Weaver acting all Faye Dunaway in ""Network"") The president is shot a Secret Service agent appears to bring down a suspect a bomb goes off somewhere else in the city and then the Plaza podium itself detonates in a massive explosion.Click. Rewind. Now were seeing the events from the point of view of that Secret Service agent Barnes (Dennis Quaid) as he radios in a suspected shooter in a hotel window overlooking the plaza brings down the suspect - who turns out to be Enrique (Eduardo Noriega) part of the mayors security detail - and reviews video camera footage shot by an American tourist played by Forest Whitaker. Boom goes the podium. Click. Rewind. Now were following Enrique. And so forth.Americas in worse shape than I thought if William Hurts the president but never mind that. The rewind/retell gambit quickly grows tiresome - were groaning by the fourth narrative reboot - and anyway the device isnt used to question the nature of truth (as it was in ""Rashomon"") but to slowly reveal a nefarious terrorist conspiracy to . . . but I can say no more. Suffice to say that Hurt gets a lot more screen time than it at first appears.Weaver largely disappears after her opening bit though and ""Vantage Point"" eventually tosses its own gimmick to settle in for a long hectic game of foil-them-Arabs with agents Barnes and Taylor (Matthew Fox of ""Lost"") crashing cars through the crowded streets of Salamanca after the Evil Mastermind (the gifted French-Moroccan actor Said Taghmaoui) his beauteous but soulless accomplice (Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer) and their various dupes and traitors.The result is a movie thats both clever and stupid - an interesting feat. Puzzle addicts may enjoy the way the pieces of Barry L. Levys script snap together if they can overlook the times he forces pieces that dont fit. (The Evil Mastermind can massacre thousands of innocents but swerves to avoid a little girl? As they say on ""Saturday Night Live"" Really?) Action fans will like the explosions. Those of us who follow the news may be alternately tickled and appalled at a movie that reduces current events to the level of an old Warner Brothers anti-Nazi flick.I guess its comforting to believe the forces of Islamic extremism can be quelled by one true-hearted American Secret Service agent. Or it used to be back when Clint Eastwood was saving the world in ""In the Line of Fire."" That was 1993 though. This is now and even the hero doesnt seem convinced Quaids scowl is screwed on so tight here he looks constipated. Maybe he tried to digest the script.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

This crazed and crazy-making thriller claims to be patterned on ""Rashomon"" the Japanese classic that re-enacts a double crime from four different points of view. The crime in this case is assassination. Seconds before the president of the United States is to make a speech in Salamanca Spain hes shot dead by a snipers bullet. But the president as the trailer makes abundantly clear isnt dead at all. Then what is the real crime? Why beating the audience about the ears eyes and brain with essentially the same sequence of events from eight characters points of view none of which adds much more than deafening hysteria and identically dreadful music. The filmmakers seem to have missed the point that each re-enactment in ""Rashomon"" provides new and conflicting information. It makes you wonder if they studied the wrong movie. Maybe they rented ""Rush Hour"" or a video on Rosh Hashanah. The director was Pete Travis -- its his first feature after some highly praised work on British and Irish TV -- and Barry L. Levy perpetrated the script. William Hurt plays the president Dennis Quaid and Matthew Fox are Secret Service agents protecting him. Forest Whitaker is an American tourist with a camcorder in his hand and Sigourney Weaver is a TV producer with a battery of cameras at her disposal. Shes the luckiest of the four since she has the least screen time but lucky is a relative term; Mr. Travis manages against all odds to make every one of the actors in his impressive cast look bad and to make all of his chases look graceless. (Mr. Quaid does more huff-and-puff chasing than anyone else more frowning and lots more talking into the curled fingers of one hand which either contains a microphone or represents some hapless directorial gesture toward a comic-book style.) The film wouldnt be worth belaboring if it werent so heavily promoted and at the same time devoid of content. Last week I sought to convey the emptiness of a thriller called ""Jumper"" while allowing for the possibility that it would be a hit which it was. (At least on its opening weekend. Less attention is paid to second and third weekends when the grosses for supposed hits sometimes fall off sharply.) This week an unsuspecting public is the target of yet another massive marketing campaign on behalf of damned near nothing and theres no reason to think the effort wont bear fruit. Its rancid fruit though if you care about the state of the medium. ""Vantage Point"" is above contempt but not all that far. Charlie Bartlett ""Charlie Bartlett"" a smart bright comedy directed by Jon Poll and written by Gustin Nash makes a mostly delightful mockery of our pill-popping culture with a precocious young hero who both pops and pushes them. Hes played by Anton Yelchin as a rich overmedicated Candide in high school -- a public high school where he has been sent after getting himself kicked out of a fancy private school for forging IDs. Charlies drug of choice is Ritalin but the choice is his psychiatrists and his stash of the stuff becomes so copious that he starts sharing it and other under-the-counter compounds with his schoolmates. Soon hes functioning as a one-man mental-health clinic -- and treating his own need to be admired -- by dispensing therapy along with pills in the boys room. The film functions as a high-wire act that can leave you giddy with laughter. Charlie is a charming optimistic character who evokes among others Ferris Bueller and Max Fischer the wunderkind of ""Rushmore""; at certain moments the film also echoes ""Harold and Maude."" Some of these correspondences are too close for comfort but ""Charlie Bartlett"" is still a debut feature of distinction and the delicacy of Anton Yelchins comic performance makes it easy to believe that Charlies classmates believe in his quiet wisdom. (The estimable Paul Sarossy was the cinematographer.) The cast includes Hope Davis at her witty radiant best as Charlies languorous and libidinous mother; Robert Downey Jr. as the schools bibulous principal; and Kat Dennings as his daughter whose bedroom looks like the inside of Peter Maxs memory bank. When the high wire goes slack its because the script has turned earnest or didactic and things that went hilariously wrong are made tidily right. Thats no tragedy though. The movie as a whole is a sweet pill to swallow. The Counterfeiters Stefan Ruzowitzkys ""The Counterfeiters"" in German with English subtitles is a concentration-camp drama with a difference and we are told with a grounding in fact. Its the story of Salomon Smolianoff or Salomon Sorowitsch as hes known in this fictionalized version who is played with haunting intensity by Karl Markovics. As a Russian Jew in Berlin Salomon is sent to a concentration camp during World War II. But Salomon is also a master counterfeiter and he is put in a ""golden cage"" -- given many of the comforts of home -- in exchange for setting up a massive operation to forge British pounds and U.S. dollars; the Nazis hope to use vast numbers of these bogus notes to weaken the Allies economies. Much of the drama turns on producing counterfeit currency thats convincing enough to fool Europes banking experts. Failure to do so will doom Salomon and the fellow Jews on his staff expert printers and collotypists who must achieve something close to perfection with severely limited resources. Yet the essence of the story Austrias entry for an Academy Award in the category of best foreign film is the moral dilemma of these privileged men who are saving their own skins by aiding the Nazi cause. ""The Counterfeiters"" is inevitably serious even austere and full of chilling ironic details. When Salomons golden-cage mates are sent to the showers for example they are bathed by warm water. Morgensterns DVD Tip ENLARGE In the Line of Fire (1993) Several key concepts in ""Vantage Point"" appeared previously in -- Id hate to say they were purloined from -- ""In the Line of Fire"" (1993). Clint Eastwood is a Secret Service agent protecting the president from a psychopathic killer played by John Malkovich. The picture directed by Wolfgang Petersen and written by Jeff Maguire is derivative in its turn but often exciting. And nothing in the story happens more than once.

Can an implausible setpiece offer up fresh thrills and insights if replayed ad infinitum from different perspectives? Not according to ""Vantage Point"" a 23-minute movie dragged out via some narrative gimmickry to a punishing hour and a half. Circling endlessly around a political assassination attempt and its violently contrived aftermath the film proves every bit as crude nerve-grinding and finally unsalvageable as the car accidents it keeps inflicting on its characters. Originally slated for a 2007 release Sony holdover is unlikely to stop traffic around multiplexes despite its attention-getting cast especially when poor word of mouth takes hold. Pic is set entirely in and around a plaza in the Spanish town of Salamanca where leaders are gathering for an international summit devoted to fighting terrorism abroad. In the first of many such sequences -- this one seen through the eyes and lenses of a news crew -- the president of the United States (William Hurt) is gunned down onstage followed by a huge explosion and mass confusion in the streets. The smoke soon clears but the plot doesnt instead turning back the clock 23 minutes and replaying the entire chain of events this time from the p.o.v. of troubled Secret Service agent Thomas Barnes (Dennis Quaid). And so Barry L. Levys script goes ""Rashomon""-style back and forth again and again tagging along with a different character and parceling out new clues with each successive go-round. After witnessing the horrific events alongside a fellow agent (Matthew Fox) Thomas perspective switches to that of a suspicious-looking Spanish cop (Eduardo Noriega); he passes the baton to a friendly American bystander (Forest Whitaker) who conveniently has a video camera; and eventually we come around to Mr. President himself who turns out to have his own unexpected view of the proceedings. Even for viewers invested in this improbably detailed scenario tedium begins to set in at around the half-hour mark -- not because the instant-replay structure couldnt work in theory but because its audience-baiting tactics are so transparent (having a character whisper ""Oh my god"" when something shocking transpires offscreen loses its punch the third or fourth time). Pic hurtles from repetitive to risible with a high-speed car chase and a hail of gunfire reaching a nadir when an adorable little girl with an ice cream cone winds up dodging traffic. Whatever their flaws recent topical dramas such as ""Lions for Lambs"" ""Rendition"" and ""In the Valley of Elah"" at least engaged with their hot-button subjects. At once timid and opportunistic ""Vantage Point"" freely milks anxiety from both 9/11 and the 2004 Madrid train bombings but otherwise stays safe and apolitical throughout. Padding out the backstory are some fleeting references to Morocco and three baddies whose origins are left deliberately vague played by French thesp Said Taghmaoui (""The Kite Runner"" ""Three Kings"") Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer (""Munich"") and Venezuelan actor Edgar Ramirez (""The Bourne Ultimatum""). Atli Orvarssons percussive score gives way to exotic crooning whenever these three enter the frame as though suddenly accompanying a terrorist-themed telenovela. Directed by Pete Travis (who debuted with the 2004 docudrama ""Omagh"") pic suggests a collision between 1998s ""Snake Eyes"" and the two most recent ""Bourne"" movies minus Brian De Palmas voyeur-implicating subtexts and Paul Greengrass kinetic precision. Pic clearly apes the latters signature style with its flailing handheld camerawork and amped-up editing; viewers not overcome by motion sickness will note the many temporal inconsistencies between replayed segments. Thesps deliver performances largely in keeping with the films hysterical tone though Sigourney Weavers cool brittle news editor (who disappears too soon after the first reel) and Hurts dignified commander in chief are welcome exceptions. Filmed at a replica of Salamancas Plaza Mayor in Mexico City pic has a convincing rally-like atmosphere and handles its cast of extras (some of them likely digital) capably enough.

"Vantage Point Boom with a view - Mercury News Entertainment Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeVantage Point Boom with a viewIN VANTAGE POINT AN ASSASSIN STRIKES - OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAINBy Bruce NewmanMercury NewsPosted 02/21/2008 103348 AM PSTUpdated 02/21/2008 053328 PM PST The bones of a good idea for a conspiracy thriller lie buried in the corpse of ""Vantage Point"" the lunkheaded account of a presidential assassination told from what are meant to be a half a dozen or more different points of view. It feels more like a movie with a personality disorder. Its supposed to be a ""Rashomon""-like story in which the camera keeps turning in a new direction to reveal some previously hidden truth. But the movie doesnt abide by its own premise and the result is often unintentionally comical a kind of ""Groundhog Day"" with guns and ammo. In the movies listless early scenes each replay of the big event seems identical except for some vital piece of information that we subsequently learn was being withheld from us. Instead of allowing each character to reveal clues as the shooting of President Ashton (William Hurt) unfolds from a new vantage point the audience gets a shotgun blast of plot twists coming from no discernibly fixed point of view. As the American president arrives in Spain for a global summit on terrorism we learn that another 4500 innocents have been killed since 9/11. In the Global News Network control room director Rex Brooks (Sigourney Weaver) barks instructions at her reporter Angie (Zoe Saldana) who appears to be the most recent winner of ""Americas Next Top Model."" The TV cameras record a pair of gunshots as Ashton raises his arms in a triumphal greeting then theres a bomb blast.Advertisement Amid the smoldering rubble the picture begins to rewind and we are transported to the same location 23 minutes earlier. This time we see everything unfold from the point of view of Secret Service agent Thomas Barnes (Dennis Quaid) who saved Ashtons life during a previous assassination attempt by taking a bullet. In the first of many remarkable coincidences that pass through the movies plot like a pig through a python this is Agent Barnes first day back on the job. And somebody mentions that after his heroic act he suffered some kind of nervous breakdown. Yet there he is standing next to the president in the middle of a European vipers nest. He thinks he sees a curtain fluttering in a distant window although maybe thats just his knees shaking. Barnes doesnt trust his own judgment and he hesitates to act. Unfortunately thats not a condition that afflicts Quaid who seems to believe that acting is all about making faces as you keep repeating the words ""Oh my God"" His partner Kent Taylor (Matthew Fox of ""Lost"" who gives no evidence of attempting to act beyond biting his lower lip) goes to investigate the suspicious window telling Barnes ""If youre wrong let me take the heat."" After the president is felled once again and the plaza explodes Barnes races into the GNN control room and demands to see the footage. As he watches the tape he does a full face-clench and croaks one more ""Oh my God"" Then the movie reloads again. The most entertaining replay comes from a Spanish policeman in the mayors security detail done as a foreign-language soap opera. The cop sees a sultry vixen in the square but she is talking to another man a stranger. The conversation is framed in a series of close-ups. There are smoldering stares in slow-motion. ""You have a glow about you"" the man tells her. ""Its the heat"" she lies. What has she been doing here with that suspicious satchel? ""I was taking in the crowd"" she lies. ""Some more than others"" he sighs. ""Te quiero"" Then you know Boom. By the time the movie comes to Howard Lewis (Forest Whitaker) a lonely American with a video camera ""Vantage Point"" has gone through four re-enactments of the assassination and its only halfway to the finish Howard is like the assassins unofficial videographer so when a Secret Service agent takes off in pursuit of the terrorist - firing wildly into the crowd by the way - hulking overweight Howie is able to sprint in tandem with the agent handicam rolling. ""This war will never end"" one character in the film says referring to the global jihadist nightmare although you get the feeling that scourge will end before the movies ceaseless replays do. At one point a Harrison Ford movie breaks out - briefly but satisfyingly. And then the whole thing ends with another huge coincidence certainly one of the biggest and most unlikely any thriller in recent memory has asked an audience to swallow. Like the rest of ""Vantage Point"" these convenient plot twists dont get better the more times you see them.  1/2Vantage Point  1/2 Mercury News Rated PG-13 (sequences of intense violence and action some disturbing images brief profanity) Cast Dennis Quaid Matthew Fox Forest Whitaker William Hurt Sigourney Weaver DirectorPete Travis WriterBarry L.

How many times have you driven past a traffic accident and wondered what set of circumstances had to play out perfectly for that person to end up in that place at that time? Coincidence plays as big a role in movies. How many films have you seen where a set of events has to happen in a particular way for say Ingrid Bergman to walk into that bar at that time? The problem with Vantage Point or at least one problem is that it depends too much on coincidence. The film about an assassination attempt on a U.S. president told from several points of view - we are practically required by the rules of movie criticism to refer to this as ""Rashomon-like"" - relies on things breaking a certain way for nearly every plot advancement. Which is not to say there arent some things to like about the film. First and foremost Matthew Fox has fun with an underdeveloped role as a Secret Service agent with . . . sorry cant say. Bruce McGill always a welcome presence practically foams at the mouth in a small role as a hawkish presidential adviser bent on bomb strikes. And as with any film told in this way its kind of enjoyable to see developments play out from different perspectives although its occasionally exasperating to go back to the beginning of the story time and again particularly when its being told through the eyes of a less interesting character. Vantage Point takes place in Spain where President Ashton (William Hurt) is to attend an anti-terrorism summit. With him is Thomas Barnes (Dennis Quaid) a Secret Service agent assigned to the presidents personal detail - he took a bullet for Ashton literally a year before. Everyone including Barnes questions whether hes ready to return and its with no little disappointment that you realize over the course of the film that this is going to be not so much a whodunit as the story of Barnes redemption. Oh well. There are halfhearted feints toward American arrogance and our standing in the world but none of it comes to much. Mostly Vantage Point is a puzzle whose pieces director Pete Travis doles out a few at a time. Its also yet another recent film along with Cloverfield and Diary of the Dead that uses found media to tell its story (though not to the extent of those films). Forest Whitaker for instance plays an American tourist who captures a key development on his video camera. And Sigourney Weaver is on hand as a cynical cable-news producer whose cameras also catch a one-in-a-million moment thats key to solving the mystery. Luckily for the president the United States the free world et al. nothing escapes Barnes careful eye. The more we learn the more unbelievable it gets. But theres a cool car chase and a couple of twists that make Vantage Point fun if not exactly good. Making it both apparently would be one coincidence too many.

In a Spanish town square the U.S. president (William Hurt) is about to address a global summit on terrorism. Moments after stepping to the podium he is struck by an assassins bullet; a minute later a bomb explodes killing dozens. The scenario unfolds from the point of view of a CNN-style news outfit its producer (Sigourney Weaver) barking orders from a command center. The movie then ""rewinds"" and we see the same tense few minutes played out again -- this time from the POV of the Secret Service agent (Dennis Quaid) who had tried to stop the man he thought was the assassin. Then we see the events again and again a grand total of six times. The director Pete Travis is a pulse-pounding technological showman whose high-strung quick-cut style might be described as JFK meets Paul Greengrass meets Jerry Bruckheimer. That said its not the plot that thickens -- its the pulp. Vantage Point starts to slide off the rails when it tracks a tourist (Forest Whitaker) and his trusty camcorder; instead of Zapruder-like intrigue the episode has him running around like an agent in a rote thriller. The segments just get more ludicrous from there. It reveals nothing to say that if a government ever used a stunt double it couldnt do so this openly or that the last episode is such a bombastic pileup of schlock conspiracy and gunplay it would embarrass Tom Clancy.
