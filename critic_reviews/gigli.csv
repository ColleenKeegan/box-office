In fact reports about the making of ""Gigli"" were so toxic that you began to wonder if they could really be true. Surely no movie could be that bad.As it turns out ""Gigli"" is not as wretched as Madonna and Guy Ritchies ""Swept Away"" but after the schadenfreudian thrill of watching beautiful people humiliate themselves wears off it has the same annihilating effect on your will to live. Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez will survive ""Gigli."" But it will be interesting to see what becomes of the director Martin Brest. Hes made good movies-- ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and ""Midnight Run""--but his last outing ""Meet Joe Black"" was so godawful that it and ""Gigli"" seem like the first two parts of a trilogy. What you see to the right is what lawyers like to call parody sprinkled with ""fair use."" The quotes are all real. The movie is not to be believed.

Low Point In Film History Gigli Is the Centurys Worst By Joe Morgenstern Updated Aug. 1 2003 100 a.m. ET Let me tell you a secret about ""The Secret Lives of Dentists."" This portrait of a failing marriage is one of the summers great discoveries and a marvel of mercurial intimacy. The film has one obvious flaw; what begins as an amusing fantasy device keeps barging in on reality. But that reality is wonderfully well observed and youd have a hard time finding two better performances than those of Campbell Scott and Hope Davis as David and Dana Hurst the husband-and-wife dentists of the title. (You may also have trouble finding the movie which opens today in only a dozen theaters around the country though it will gradually go into wider distribution. For theaters and dates click here. Teeth are more than pearly pretexts here for mordant drama; theyre a metaphor for marriage which requires constant care and sometimes extensive repair. The marriage has already begun to decay before Daves realization that Danas having an affair. Then things really fall apart in Alan Rudolphs screen version of Jane Smileys novella ""The Age of Grief"" which was adapted inventively and for the most part successfully by the playwright Craig Lucas. The story is told from the husbands point of view. Dave knows hes not the man hed like to be or the man his lovely ardent wife hoped he would be but we see much more that hes closed off from himself as well as from her; that he has used sex in their marriage as a substitute for friendship (one heartbreaking scene begins when she asks him if he likes her); that hes seething with anger (one chilling scene plays out in front of their three young daughters) and that hes terrified of confronting the cause of his mortal grief. Because much of the story is Daves interior dialogue with his tortured self Mr. Lucas has opened him up by expanding a fleeting presence in the novella a pugnacious white-knuckle patient named Slater into an omniscient companion. Played cannily by Denis Leary Slater is Daves caustic interlocutor and conscience -- Jiminy Cricket as a jazz trumpeter. Hes intriguing for a while then a nuisance who seems to have wandered in from a surreal stage play. Apart from the problem of Slater though or even with it ""The Secret Lives of Dentists"" is the best thing Alan Rudolph has done since his delightful -- and now sadly unavailable -- ""Songwriter"" in 1984. No drama in recent memory has evoked married life with such penetrating detail -- every parent will register the doleful ring of truth when the whole family comes down with the flu -- or with such a marvelous cast. The drilling done by this film is far from painless but its restorative. Gigli ""Gigli"" which stars Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez is the worst movie -- all right the worst allegedly major movie -- of our admittedly young century. More stupefying follies may come but its impossible to imagine how theyll beat this one for staggering idiocy fatuousness or pretension. Mr. Affleck plays Larry Gigli whose last name is pronounced ""Jeally"" not ""Giggly""; hes a petty hoodlum assigned to kidnap the young brain-damaged brother of a federal prosecutor. (The brother is played cloyingly by Justin Bartha.) Ms. Lopez is Ricki an enforcer assigned to make sure Gigli does what hes supposed to. In a movie thats being marketed as a romantic comedy its something of an inconvenience that Ricki is gay but thats the least of the problems she presents; a similar premise worked perfectly well in ""Chasing Amy."" Ricki is given to matchlessly self-enchanted soliloquies that include instructions on gouging an antagonists eyes out and she delivers her own jaw-droppingly narcissistic version of ""The Vagina Monologues."" As for Gigli who deserves to be called Giggly he delivers a dissertation on evolution and the penis strikes popinjay poses and spouts florid dialogue with withered roots in Damon Runyon. ""Gigli"" offers in addition a brief but verbose appearance by Christopher Walken and yet another exhibition of galloping Al Pacinoism by Al Pacino. The movie was written and directed by Martin Brest. His previous feature ""Meet Joe Black"" took booby prizes for sententiousness and glacial pace but ""Gigli"" is something else. Its inexplicable. The Magdalene Sisters ""The Magdalene Sisters"" opens with an almost wordless sequence of such riveting brilliance and horror as to seem unsustainable A young woman Margaret (Anne-Marie Duff) is brutally raped at a wedding party in Dublin while the pipers play and the guests dance. Yet Peter Mullans film pretty much sustains it all -- the brilliance with the horror. This fictional story purportedly based on fact seems straight out of the 19th century or before. But the time is the 1960s when innocent Irish girls like Margaret are still being incarcerated in Magdalene Asylums -- combination reformatories and commercial laundries run by the Catholic Church where inmates are forced to work under appalling conditions. (The last laundry were told closed in 1996.) While Margarets supposed sin was shaming her family the film follows the similarly blighted fates and incarcerations of Bernadette (Nora-Jane Noone) a headstrong student at an orphanage whose offense is conspicuous beauty and Rose (Dorothy Duffy) a sweet hapless girl who gives birth to a child out of wedlock. It should be noted that Catholic groups have denounced ""The Magdalene Sisters"" on the grounds that similar conditions prevailed during the same era at Protestant-run institutions as well. Be that as it may Mr. Mullan who played the title role in Ken Loachs ""My Name Is Joe"" evokes a nightmare world of sadistic nuns and predatory priests a world in which religious tenets have been twisted into pitiless tyranny. See ""The Magdalene Sisters"" for its own sake; the performances alone are inspirational. But see it too as an example of how powerful a feature film still can be in the hands of an impassioned filmmaker. And Now Ladies and Gentlemen The good news about Claude Lelouchs ""And Now Ladies and Gentlemen"" -- theres no bad news -- is that the man who made the sublimely superficial ""A Man and a Woman"" almost four decades ago has grown in wisdom and artistry but hasnt lost his love of glossy surfaces. This new film glitters on land and sea. Valentin an English jewel thief played by Jeremy Irons is suddenly beset by memory loss; he cant recall his thefts or whether in fact he has stolen. Jane a jazz chanteuse played by the French cabaret singer Patricia Kaas (in a drop-dead-dazzling film debut) cant remember her lyrics. Soon they make their separate ways to Morocco (he sails his own sailboat which is called Ladies and Gentlemen). There connected medically if not astrally they pursue radically different therapies and eventually each other. Whats real and whats imagined along the way? Who knows? Whats the meaning of it all? Who cares? Theres genuine feeling between kindred spirits in the midst of all the stylishness and a delicacy of tone thats quite remarkable given the potential for self-parody. I enjoyed every glowing frame of the leisurely trip which is punctuated by sententious epigrams. (""Lies are dreams caught red-handed"" or ""Marriage is the perfect murder of love."") I also noticed that the movie is rated PG-13 for I kid you not ""momentary language."" The language may well be momentary but the images are momentous and scrumptious. American Wedding ""American Wedding"" is the third panel of an increasingly soiled triptych that includes ""American Pie"" and ""American Pie 2."" The first as funny as it was raunchy depicted sexobsessed buddies desperate to lose their virginity before graduation from high school. Now one of the buddies played by Jason Biggs is out of college and getting married but sex obsession still rules. This is a gross-out saga that sentient adults should avoid like the plague notwithstanding one good gag that almost literally takes your breath -- and appetite -- away.    DVD TIP Alan Rudolph wrote and directed another movie in 1984 ""Choose Me."" It has the twin virtues of being available and quite magical a romantic roundelay set in Los Angeles that links lonely lovers in felicitous ways. The extraordinary cast includes Keith Carradine Lesley Ann Warren John Larroquette Rae Dawn Chong Ed Ruscha and most memorably Genevieve Bujold as a radio therapist named Dr. Love. The songs of Teddy Pendergrass grace the sound track.

Columbia Pictures By Christy LemireThe Associated Press Published Friday August 1 2003 at 330 a.m. Last Modified Thursday July 31 2003 at 1100 p.m. ""Gigli"" -- which spawned the phenomenon the gossip pages and celebrity magazines so lovingly refer to as ""Bennifer"" -- is every bit as unwatchable as the deafening negative chatter would suggest. Facts REVIEW ""Gigli""  out of Directed by Martin BrestStarring Jennifer Lopez Ben Affleck Justin BarthaRated R for sexual content pervasive language and brief strong language.Opens Today at Bama 6 The dialogue from writer-/sdirector Martin Brest is clunky the film has serious tonal inconsistencies and at more than two hours it drags on way longer than it should.Even making a little game of it and trying to pinpoint the exact moment when Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez fell in love stops being fun after a while.Perhaps its when he says in an attempt to seduce her ""Im the bull youre the cow.""Or when she beckons him into foreplay by lying back in bed and purring ""Gobble gobble"" -- which could forever change the way you view your Thanksgiving turkey.But as pop-star vehicles go ""Gigli"" isnt as insufferable as say last years Madonna-Guy Ritchie debacle ""Swept Away."" Its more on par with Mariah Careys ""Glitter"" and Britney Spears ""Crossroads.""If this were a movie starring two B-list actors or two complete unknowns it probably would have gone straight to video. After curious masochists and J.Lo fans check it out the first weekend ""Gigli"" probably will have a drop-off in audience that rivals ""The Hulk"" -- 70 percent -- then go to video. And with the release next spring of Kevin Smiths ""Jersey Girl"" in which they also co-star we can have this little conversation all over again.For now we have Affleck starring as incompetent mob thug Larry Gigli. (Thats pronounced JEE-lee which rhymes with really a running joke that isnt particularly funny the first time.)Gigli is asked to kidnap Brian (Justin Bartha) the mentally disabled younger brother of a/sfederal prosecutor whos going after a New York mobster (Al Pacino).His boss however thinks hes incapable of handling the assignment alone and sends in Ricki (Lopez) another contractor to help him. Gigli is an anti-social lout who lives in a seedy apartment. Ricki is beautiful grounded enlightened. She quotes Sun Tzu -- who could blame Gigli for falling for her? (And whether you like her or not Lopez does have an undeniable presence.)But Ricki is also a lesbian -- so it makes absolutely no sense when she falls for him too although they have all the obligatory banter and alleged sexual tension required of a romantic comedy. (And its only a romantic comedy sometimes. Other times it aims to be an edgy action-crime movie; still other times it aspires for gag-inducing poignancy.)Apparently the only force that binds them is the fact that they both feel squeamish about cutting off Brians thumb and mailing it to his prosecutor brother. Instead they break into a morgue and saw the thumb off a corpse using a plastic knife while Brian -- who has an unexplained penchant for old-school rap -- sings Sir Mix-a-Lots ""Baby Got Back.""Its also incredibly misinformed to suggest that Ricki can be ""converted"" to heterosexuality -- that a mans love is all she really needed to allay any confusion about all that silly lesbian stuff.So what you have here is ""Rain Man"" meets ""Chasing Amy"" -- which is apropos since the latter is a 1997 Kevin Smith movie in which Affleck also starred as a guy who falls for a lesbian. Instead of counting matches and obsessing about ""The Peoples Court"" like Dustin Hoffmans ""Rain Man"" character Brian counts sunflower seeds and obsesses over going to ""the Baywatch.""Cameos from Pacino Christopher Walken as a detective and Lainie Kazan as Giglis mother dont help either.Did they owe someone a favor? What are they doing here? Pacino won his one and only Oscar with Brest for 1992s ""Scent of a Woman"" but couldnt he have just thanked the director instead?Instead we get to see Pacino shoot someone in the head then watch as fish in a nearby aquarium snack on splattered drops of the victims blood.Hoo-ah Take a pass on GigliBen Affleck and Jennifer Lopez star in ""Gigli.""TuscaloosaNews.comJuly 31 2003 1100 PM""Gigli"" -- which spawned the phenomenon the gossip pages and celebrity magazines so lovingly refer to as ""Bennifer"" -- is every bit as unwatchable as the deafening negative chatter would suggest.The dialogue from writer-/sdirector Martin Brest is clunky the film has serious tonal inconsistencies and at more than two hours it drags on way longer than it should.Even making a little game of it and trying to pinpoint the exact moment when Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez fell in love stops being fun after a while.Perhaps its when he says in an attempt to seduce her ""Im the bull youre the cow.""Or when she beckons him into foreplay by lying back in bed and purring ""Gobble gobble"" -- which could forever change the way you view your Thanksgiving turkey.But as pop-star vehicles go ""Gigli"" isnt as insufferable as say last years Madonna-Guy Ritchie debacle ""Swept Away.""

Comments Gigli Can you buy the notion of Jennifer Lopez as a hit woman even in a romantic comedy? It doesnt look like she costar Ben Affleck or writer-director Martin Brest can even though thats the setup. Lopez and Affleck play heavies assigned by a crime lord to watch over the kidnapped mentally challenged young brother (Justin Bartha) of a federal prosecutor but this is less a narrative than a lecture-demonstration on the innate superiority of the New Agey womans brains style femininity and open bisexuality over the old-fashioned mans bad taste violence and seemingly straight macho bluster. For the most part I was able to accept this thesis and enjoy Lopez in her usual superwoman role but the script does get awfully preachy in spots. Brief but flamboyant cameos by Christopher Walken and Al Pacino helped keep me distracted from the noble intentions and the silliness. 124 min.

Lopez is Ricki reluctant homosexual and late-night yoga enthusiast who charms her way into the hideout apartment to supervise the job. The pain comes in many forms (the sparkless Ben-Jen compound a bellowing Al Pacino turn an orgasmic close-up on slack-faced Affleck when he Nails the Lesbian) but most acutely in the impaired-brother subplot and the slavish adherence to Hollywood psychiatry whereby a disordered mind is tidied by adventure and romance. Mitigating factors a carefully curated sampling of J-Lo butt cleavage and an arrhythmic Christopher Walken cameo which momentarily diverts the doomed ship from collision with the iceberg. JWin.

More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Affleck in way over his head plays Larry Gigli a dim bulb of a mob enforcer. Gigli (its pronounced jeel-ly but everyone gets it wrong) has kidnapped mental patient Brian (Justin Bartha doing Rain Man) the kid brother of a federal prosecutor to keep mob boss Starkman (Al Pacino in an overwrought cameo) from going to jail. Dont ask how. Know only that mob cutie Ricki (Lopez) a lesbian with a suicidal girlfriend has been sent in to make sure Gigli doesnt screw up. Lopez treats the role like a photo shoot doing yoga exercises in Giglis apartment and ruminating on why its more erotic to kiss a vagina than a penis. Writer-director Martin Brest who should have learned from his last fiasco Meet Joe Black instead provides more excruciating dialogue and slack pacing. Christopher Walken gets laughs as a nutso cop but the focus soon switiches to what motivates Ricki to spread her legs and tell Gigli to and I quote ""gobble-gobble."" Careers have been crushed by less. Test audiences reportedly balked at the films happy ending and wanted Gigli and Ricki to die bloody deaths. And they say critics are harsh.

No double-entendre in le divorce ; like le drugstore  its one of those words understood equally in Massachusetts or Montparnasse. And its the perfect title for the new Merchant-Ivory film about what happens when an American girl in Paris tries to divorce a French husband and two cultures collide. The theme of Le Divorce is a Gallic spin on the old saying ""Love is eternal-as long as it lasts."" It doesnt translate but youll get the message-and enjoy it too. Unlike the costume epics that have made the Merchant-Ivory team famous Le Divorce is a hip contemporary romantic comedy but it has all of director James Ivorys informed compassion for lavish detail his usual all-star ensemble of stylish personalities spread across a crowded canvas of complex emotions dozens of settings throughout Paris and another script of wit and intelligence by Mr. Ivory and the unofficial third member of the Merchant-Ivory team Ruth Prawer Jhabvala. The elements blend smoothly to create a delightful blend of American sensibility and French chaos in a movie that is sunny surprising and consistently entertaining. Based on the 1997 novel by Diane Johnson its the chronicle of an American-style marital smash-up dressed in a fashionable and sophisticated couture of manners and morals that is decidedly French. Amidst the fabulous food in four-star Michelin restaurants and the stratospheric shopping sprees on the Rue St. Honore (talk about a location shoot that looks like quel fun) three plot lines converge the Parisian-style coming of age of Isabel (Kate Hudson) a California peach with a Technicolor smile who arrives in Paris to find her pregnant half-sister Roxy in the middle of a domestic crisis; the emotional upheaval of Roxy (Naomi Watts) an expatriate poet married to a pompous irresponsible French scoundrel who has now deserted her for a lusty Czech mistress who is married in turn to a jealous American psycho (Matthew Modine); and the two sisters battle to save a family heirloom from being confiscated by the French-a valuable Baroque painting created in France but brought over from Los Angeles now wanted by three museums. Very complex stuff peppered with characters that come and go like aperitifs and it gets denser scene by scene. While helping Roxy through her pregnancy and depression Isabel gets a job working for Olivia Pace (Glenn Close) another American expatriate who is writing her memoirs after decades of sexual political and literary adventures in the City of Light-a combination of Mary McCarthy and Susan Sontag no doubt but as played by Ms. Close looking more like Janet Flanner. Isabel also researches her own definition of lamour fou with a much older very married French diplomat (French heartthrob Thierry Lhermitte) who also happens to be the uncle of Roxys two-timing husband. Add to the bouillabaisse the girls parents (Stockard Channing and Sam Waterston) who want to drag poor deserted Roxy and her priceless painting back to Santa Barbara; the Getty Museums art curator (Bebe Neuwirth) and the pompous art expert for the Old Masters division of Christies in London (ribald Oscar Wilde look-alike Stephen Fry) two rivals in the art world with material designs on Roxys painting both fighting to smuggle the canvas out of France; and Suzanne de Persand (Leslie Caron) Roxys imperial mother-in-law and the controlling matriarch of her sons upper-class family who will stop at nothing to apply the tenets of French divorce law for her own domestic materialism. Somehow it all comes to an explosive head in a spray of melodramatic bullets on top of the Eiffel Tower with Matthew Modine getting even with everybody perhaps for the smallness of his role. The ersatz ending which I wont spoil is unconvincing enough to be the one disappointment in an otherwise radiant experience. But even if you tire of the pace the plotting and the population youll love the jewels the 17th-century furniture the excursion to Leslie Carons country estate Mr. Lhermittes sexy bachelor den in Montmartre the luxurious lunch at Laperouse the arrondissements which architecturally change personalities as fast as the people who live in them ... in short all the things that make Paris Paree. Kate Hudson as the films centerpiece more than makes up for the lame work shes done in her last four films and the rest of the performances are juicy as profiteroles and stylish as Lanvin. Pierre Lhommes bright polished cinematography bounces off the retina like holiday sparklers the memorable music by Merchant-Ivory veteran Richard Robbins is rich and sensual and the masterful editing by John David Allen is a moving collage of images sounds and tempos that keeps the movie on its feet from start to finish. In a summer of wet noodles Le Divorce is a Sunday picnic in the park with a modern zonked-out George. Turkey Time Everyone has machine-gunned the catastrophic Gigli for an infinite number of perfectly justifiable reasons but as tired as I am of the lousy misguided Ben Affleck-Jennifer Lopez duet I still dont find their vulgar overhyped love song as sour and off-key as the one once howled by Sean Penn and Madonna or Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley. If only they would restrict their boring public affair to the lenses of the paparazzi and not the cameras of the motion-picture screen saving sane and paying customers hours of undeserved punishment and move it to somewhere private we dont want to know about like a mud slide in Bosnia. But here they are in torturous closeups on a mall screen near you reminding the world how superficial badly advised greedy for fame and fanfare desperate for money and attention and pathetically incompetent they both are in the only two things that matter in career longevity-craft and talent. As oblivious as they are to criticism and as unwilling as they are to learn from past mistakes (would you believe theyve got yet another movie on the way?) they seem doomed to frivolity and make-believe. I predict the worst. Remember even Mrs. Lincoln liked a good play. Trying to analyze Gigli is like constructing a rocket ship out of paper clips. Its a moronic maze about a bungling Los Angeles hit man named Gigli (rhymes with ""feely"") dispatched to kidnap the mentally disabled kid brother (Justin Bartha) of a federal prosecutor. Joining him is another Hollywood contractor (J. Lo) who does yoga and gets a lot of unintentional laughs quoting Eastern philosophy. She is also a lesbian who blabs a lot of contrived bilge about the power of vaginas that cannot be quoted here. As a matter of fact the dialogue in this fiasco is so filthy and inane you cant even write it down. Shapeless and without a shred of originality the movie mimics and copies pieces of a number of old movies all superior in every way. The kid counts sunflower seeds and sings hip-hop songs and gets on your nerves faster than Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man . Though it defeats the purposes of motivation and logic Mr. Afflecks tough tattooed mob slob falls for the man-hating lesbian the same way he did in Chasing Amy  mysteriously converting her to heterosexuality when she throws him on the bed mounts him for the silliest sex scene in movie history and announces ""Its turkey time"" (A line that makes no sense without a baster.) Turkey sex apparently softens their hard hearts if not their hilariously fumbling accents. Theres a big deal about feeling blue about cutting off the retarded kids thumb and mailing it to his brother. So they break into the morgue and saw the thumb off a corpse with a plastic knife while the kid sings the rap song ""Baby Got Back."" The two stars are only slightly less plastic than the knife but a great deal phonier. They are undeniably buff and wear as little as possible to prove it but they remain pitifully clueless when required to pronounce a word containing more than two syllables or play a scene for even the most minimal dramatic impact. Writer-director Martin Brest offers no help in the direction of realism. While the garbage mounts he distracts from our irritability quotient with screechingly dissonant cameos by Lainie Kazan Christopher Walken and Al Pacino who won an undeserved Oscar in Mr. Brests Scent of a Woman and doesnt mind trashing his reputation to say thanks. Will anybody see this movie or-like Madonna in Swept Away -will it vanish without a fingerprint to prove it ever existed in the first place? Lurid curiosity seekers may check it out like the ambulance chasers who flock to fires and the freaks who would pay anything for a front-row seat at a public execution. I would consider it miraculous if any of the victims of Gigli ever spoke to each other again but knowing Hollywood they are probably already planning a sequel. Hope Springs Eternal Bob Hope lasted a whole century and for the next 100 years theyll probably still be rewarding him for it. Although he made few films of any impact or lasting importance he did win five Oscars-not for his acting but for humanitarian causes and industry contributions. He was more famous for his sarcastic one-liners celebrity golf tournaments and flag-waving morale-boosting trips to the battlefronts of every war where the American military saw action than he was for his movies. Still the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center is celebrating this show-business institution from Aug. 8 to 14 with a 13-film salute called ""Thanks for the Memories"" which was planned long before he died on July 27. The Film Society of Lincoln Center has creepy but perfect timing if you ask me. While the menu spans the highlights of his comedy career it offers few surprises. Four of the best Bob Hope movies- Fancy Pants and Critics Choice  both with Lucille Ball and Sorrowful Jones and The Lemon Drop Kid  both based on Damon Runyon tales-are curiously missing. Three of the seven popular but now hopelessly dated Road pictures he made with Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour are included as well as two films that hold up better- The Paleface and The Facts of Life (also with Lucille Ball). What you wont see much of-and this is an area of his achievement people always overlook-is the positively amazing number of songs Ol Ski Nose introduced on stage and screen. Before he ever journeyed west in 1938 Leslie Townes Hope had already sung Jerome Kerns ""Youre Devastating"" in Roberta and performed Cole Porters ""Its De-Lovely"" with Ethel Merman and Jimmy Durante in Red Hot and Blue . But he really made history in 1936 when Ira Gershwin teamed with Vernon Duke to write the score for the musical revue Ziegfeld Follies of 1936 . This sensation starred Fanny Brice Josephine Baker Gertrude Niesen Judy Canova and the dancing Nicholas Brothers but it was newcomer Bob Hope who stopped the show singing ""I Cant Get Started"" to bored showgirl Eve Arden while she yawned and manicured her nails. Hollywood called and the rest is history. At Paramount Hopes warbling abilities were under-utilized especially after he teamed with Crosby. The writing team of Burke and Van Heusen created several musical masterpieces for those dopey Road pictures but they were all sung by Der Bingle. Still in The Big Broadcast of 1938  his first Hollywood film Hope turned ""Thanks for the Memory"" into a popular standard that became his theme song for the rest of his life. In the western spoof The Paleface (1948) he turned a throwaway ditty by Jay Livingston and Ray Evans called ""Buttons and Bows"" into such a smash hit that the song won an Academy Award. I laugh every time I see Bob Hope saddle up to voluptuous Jane Russell on the lyric line ""My bones denounce ... the buckboard bounce."" Three years later in The Lemon Drop Kid  the same songwriting team provided Hope with another blockbuster and ""Silver Bells"" became an annual holiday classic. The king of wisecracks was also no slug when it came to plugging tunes. Bob Hope funny icon international hero buried wearing more medals than General Eisenhower. A bigger celebration seems mandatory. But lets face it-death at 100 years old lacks a certain spontaneity.

"Should Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez apologize for Gigli? Slate Sign In Sign Up Should Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez apologize for Gigli? Should Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez apologize for Gigli? Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Aug. 1 2003 1234 PM The Mod Couple Ben and J-Lo attempt acting. By David Edelstein Lesbianism besmirched in Gigli Do Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez the stars of Gigli (Columbia) have chemistry? Of a sort He brings out her mushiness and she brings out his wooziness. Its not the stuff of great screen pairings which tend to thrive on tension more than harmony. Lopez plays Ricki a lesbian ""independent contractor"" dispatched to keep tabs on a none-too-swift hood Gigli (Affleck) who has been ordered to kidnap the mentally disabled brother of a federal prosecutor. Lopez saunters into Afflecks bachelor pad and mocks his machismo then tells him not to ""allow the seed of carnal hope to sprout"" in his soul. But within seconds this ostensibly hard-ass dyke is jiggling her tongue and giving her co-star hot appraising looks--which turn Affleck already an actor of amazing edgelessness into a twinkling doughboy. Disparaging her sexual preferences he tells her that ""every relationship has a bull and a cow"" but Gigli looks for all the world like heifers in love. Advertisement Its tempting to try to make a case for Gigli which has already been widely mocked but Im not that perverse The movie is bafflingly boring and ridiculous. Its loginess is exacerbated by the pacing of the writer-director Martin Brest a onetime nervy NYU prodigy who moved to the West Coast around the time of Beverly Hills Cop (1984) stocked himself a big fat wine cellar and lost his New York edge. His last comedy Meet Joe Black (1998) clocked in at three long hours and he doesnt seem to want to end his scenes in Gigli either. Lopez holds forth on female cunnilingus (""The mouth is the twin sister of the vagina ..."") while doing stretching exercises in tiny gym shorts and a bursting halter; unfathomable as it sounds I got tired of looking at her. Brest has imported a pair of New York stars--Christopher Walken and Al Pacino--to give a couple of scenes a Method-y jolt. But no one has any idea what Walken and Pacino are supposed to be playing. Gigli turns the audience into heifers staring dumbly. Brest was slotted to direct Rain Man (1988) and he seems never to have gotten over the loss of that gig. He reused parts of the plot in Midnight Run (1988) which actually made it to the screen first and now he recycles the autistic brother motif The kidnap victim Brian (Justin Bartha) tests Giglis patience with hysterical tantrums (they revolve around Baywatch instead of Judge Wapner) before winning the big guys heart. Giglis advice to Brian on the subject of how to approach women evidently makes him even more alluring to his lesbian antagonist who finally demands some of that ""sweet hetero lingus"" for herself. Id suggest that Lopez and Affleck issue a public apology to lesbians but when moviedoms hottest couple is reduced to gobbling and mooing at each other its likely that heterosexuality has suffered the more lasting injury.

Compare it to what passes for sophisticated filmmaking in this country and the movie becomes a living instrument of cinematic humanism lovingly intent on observing not judging; concerned with sympathy not control; accepting the inevitable ambiguities not denying them. Its an approach prevalent in French films and though its not exclusively feminine (Arnaud Desplechin Olivier Assayas and Cedric Klapisch have all nailed this Rohmeresque sensibility) Lopes-Curval lends it a nurturing generosity. Devoid of any dictatorial point of view or dramatic structure Seaside ambles like a beachcombing on- and off-screen. Lopes-Curval makes it look easy Quartered into seasonal sections and set entirely in a tiny fading beach community dependent upon a local quarry operation that digs and sorts decorative rocks the movie wanders among more than a dozen locals and vacationers catching snippets of their behavior and inner tensions. Marie (Helene Fillieres) a young assembly-line stone sorter seems dissatisfied with everything including her pushing-30 lifeguard boyfriend Paul (Jonathan Zaccai) whose lonely mother Rose (Bulle Ogier) has blown her retirement savings at the towns small casino. Marie is otherwise tempted by Albert (Patrick Lizana) the son of the factorys original owner and now a powerless bureaucrat with the new company. Scores of other characters come and go--including a fashion photographer his blissfully dim girlfriend and his lovely increasingly anxious mother (Ludmila Mikael)--but we see them only in random cross sections. The changing of the seasons leaves some of the towns inhabitants gone some pregnant some resolved to shoulder their burdens; we are not necessarily privy to the changes or how they came about. We do get subtle gestures and evaporating moments a mother looking with fondness and worry after her son a tug on an uncomfortable dress a cocktail drained too quickly a decision to hold ones tongue visualized as an eyebrow flex. Its a gently sensible strategy that dares to suggest as Renoir Ozu Rohmer and Kiarostami films do that you can only know so much about other people by watching them and that our small ""knowing"" says as much about us as it does about the subjects of our attention. Certainly Hollywood films encourage us to enjoy an absurd God-like omniscience; all relevant thoughts incidents and connections are made plain as day. In her first feature Lopes-Curval lets the human mysteries play out invisibly and even the actors are forced to economize in short scenes of little dramatic import. A stare held a split second too long or an evaded gaze can mean the world. Seen last spring in the Walter Reades ""Rendez-Vous With French Cinema"" series and bearing a Cannes Camera dOr Lopes-Curvals film has too small a canvas to be heavyweight but the grand-dame triumvirate of Ogier (aging oddly as only movie stars do) Mikael (a 30-year veteran and Sautet alum) and Liliane Rovere (a Blier favorite playing a prodigal trophy widow) musters a sort of old-town grandeur all its own. In the end though Seasides about a place and some people--as if we were vacationing ourselves and the other inhabitants were merely passing us on the boardwalk. On the far side of convincing Martin Brests Gigli displays nerve both in bearing a perverse title likely to provoke a curdled-milk sneer in most filmgoers and in positing Jennifer Lopez as a mob contractor-hit woman dressed like a Radley Metzger sprite. The titular lug (Ben Affleck) whose pointlessly difficult name barely sustains two bad jokes is a dim false-bravado-exuding wise guy told to kidnap a retarded teenager (Justin Bartha) whose brother is a fed prosecuting the East Coast boss. Assigned as coverage Lopezs vampy breathy New Age-y dyke Ricki provides Gigli with an obscurely flirty object of desire Lopez with an excuse to perform her stretch workout for us and Brest with the odd bickering-couple shtick each of his movies demands. The basilisk-eyed tissue-voiced Affleck must strain for personality and so Brest coasts on Lopezs redoubtable glow. (Affleck has wooed a lesbian before--in Chasing Amy--and it might be his best shot at a career theme; Brest even throws in an overwritten Kevin Smith scene in which the two gendernauts debate the contrasting glories of penis and vagina. Clearly Smiths Lopez-Affleck-starring Jersey Girl will be deja vu all over again.) Having the simple advantage of being a dialogue-dependent film in a summer ocean of monosyllabitis Gigli would simply be mild potato au gratin if it werent for the patronizing Rain Man setup and mercenary zeal for jokes made at the expense of the mentally handicapped. Gigli berates insults dismisses throttles and bellows at Barthas meticulously aped retard and then turns sensitive and warm--its hard to decide which attitude is more insulting. Christopher Walken and Lainie Kazan manage to brighten the one dull scene each gets and since Lopez is best at quiet brooding and sultry playfulness she hits her notes consistently. But Brest would have to go back to his outline to repair this lemon and give America something akin to what its told it really wants--a helping of Lopez-Affleck home movies.

The advance word on this film was so vicious that I had to see for myself if its as bad as its early reputation suggested. The verdict Gigli doesnt live up to (or should that be down to?) its hype. The worst film of all time? Give me a break. Gigli isnt even the worst film of the summer and wont come close to the years Bottom 10 list. Im not going to defend the movie. I dont recommend it and for the most part its an example of inept filmmaking but it is watchable. I have to wonder if those who are coming down so hard on the motion picture have a secondary agenda. Are they reviewing Gigli or are they making a comment on the tabloid supersaturation associated with the Jen amp; Ben show? (As a side note I am unable to determine why anyone but their friends and family care whats going on with these two. What difference does it make to your life?) Admittedly the plot is nothing short of idiotic. Larry (Affleck) and Ricki (Lopez) are two Los Angeles enforcers on the payroll of gangster Louis (Lenny Vito) who is trying to do a favor for Starkman (Al Pacino) a New York City mob boss currently up on a string of criminal charges. To that end Louis commands Larry and Ricki to abduct the mentally handicapped brother of a federal prosecutor assuming that will give Starkman leverage. After nabbing Brian (Justin Bartha) from a care facility Larry brings him to his apartment. Shortly thereafter Ricki shows up and informs Larry that hes stuck with her until the mission is over. So for the next several days they hang around keeping a mistrustful eye on each other arguing and waiting for Louis to call with additional instructions. When Larry tries to put the movies on Ricki he discovers that hes not her ideal partner - shes a lesbian. Ben Affleck who does his best work in ""average guy"" parts is in over his head giving a performance that is as uneven as his accent. His attempts to portray macho chauvinistic Larry come across as cartoonish. Fortunately however Affleck does exhibit some chemistry with his co-star. It doesnt burn up the screen but it is there simmering beneath the surface. For Lopez this does not represent a return to the kind of top-notch acting she showed in movies like Selena and Out of Sight but its a vast improvement over her one-dimensional turn in Enough. Justin Bartha has the unenviable part of playing a walking plot device - the retarded character whos on hand to alternately provide comic relief and fake sentiment. Al Pacino and Christopher Walken have one-scene appearances that allow them to do what they do best. For Walken thats to act weird and for Pacino thats to shout a lot almost to the point of foaming at the mouth. Some of the dialogue is astonishingly awful. Sex and relationships are constantly likened to animal interaction. When Ricki wants some action she purrs ""Its turkey time."" Then when Larry doesnt get it she adds ""Gobble gobble."" He on the other hand assures her that ""in every relationship theres a bull and a cow."" Later to prove his point he moos. Yet as bad as this material is there is a wonderfully inventive conversation in which Ricki and Larry advocate the superiority of their sex organs. For him its all about the penis. For her its the vagina monologues. And this dialogue which occurs while Lopez is clad in spandex shorts doing yoga is a real winner. Gigli is kind of like that - rare worthwhile scenes buried under tons of garbage. Director Martin Brest doesnt understand the meaning of the word brevity. Gigli could easily have been 30 minutes shorter. Although Brest doesnt have his characters pause as painfully often as they did in Meet Joe Black conversations and scenes frequently last too long. Maybe the problem is that Brest needs a better editor. And at least in this case a better plot. Brest has made a romantic comedy. Although there are plenty of unintentional laughs some of the deliberate humor also works. The romantic element of the movie is bound to cause some controversy since Gigli fulfills the male fantasy of the guy winning over the lesbian. However the movie makes it plain that Ricki isnt really a lesbian but a bisexual who is fed up with men. And besides Ben Affleck has been in this situation before. Anyone remember Chasing Amy? Some reviewers have complained about the levels of gore and profanity in Gigli. Careful examination however will reveal that movies like Quentin Tarantinos Pulp Fiction contain far more instances of the f-word and a lot more brain splatter than can be found here. Such comments seem like red herrings from those who are looking for more ammunition to lob at Gigli. This isnt a good film but when set alongside the likes of Dumb and Dumberer and Legally Blonde 2 Jen amp; Ben offer less pain.

""Gigli"" arrives carrying more baggage than a Greyhound bus which may distract moviegoers from what is a silly but still an enjoyably written and performed romantic comedy. With a real-life romance between its two leads that seems to draw equal measures of scorn and curiosity and a story that sounds ludicrous but is actually fun to watch this late-summer entry will likely check out of theaters before it recoups but discover an active afterlife. Only the second film in a decade (following the disastrous ""Meet Joe Black"") from Martin Brest and the first written solely by him since ""Going in Style"" in 1979 pic is one of the few in current release from major studios to rely on dialogue and character creation rather than slam-bang action.The story has small-time L.A. mobster Larry Gigli (Ben Affleck) enlisted by his boss to carry out the kidnapping of a mentally handicapped kid (Justin Bartha) as a means of putting pressure on the kids brother a federal prosecutor giving a hard time to a underworld higher-up (Al Pacino). No sooner has Gigli (rhymes with ""really"") installed the kid in his apartment for safe-keeping than he gets another roommate -- a tough-talking midriff-baring female mob operative and knock-out named Ricki (Jennifer Lopez) who moves in under orders to make sure that Gigli doesnt screw up the job. Stuck in Giglis dingy digs handsome pair has plenty of time to move from loathing to lusting for one another. The roadblock is that Ricki claims to be a lesbian and backs it up with a convincing monologue on why the female form is more desirable performed along with a series of provocative yoga poses that quickly have Giglis mind reduced to mush. But the prideful Lothario regroups and the battle of the sexes is on. The story is nonsensical to be sure and grows more so but for connoisseurs of romantic comedy its sometimes clear that the whole point is to savor the thrust and parry as love blooms between the leads -- much as action junkies forgive ludicrous set-ups on the way to a great fight scene -- and in this department ""Gigli"" does score. Its often profane flights of lyrical rhetoric are often hilarious on a par with the character-based wackiness of ""Bull Durham"" at times; at others it evokes ""Chasing Amy"" in outrageousness while lacking that pics seriousness of purpose. Lopez and Affleck are thoroughly engaging in their smartly calibrated opposites -- his lost boy under a tough Vinnie-from-the-block exterior to her sensually purring Zen warrior. Lopez has not been this good since ""Out of Sight"" while Afflecks turn should add a measure of respect to what seems like an inordinately charmed career. In other roles Lenny Venito displays magnetically seedy panache as Louis the small-time mob boss. Justin Bartha in his debut as the handicapped Brian gives a performance likely to put him on the map despite its obvious debt to Dustin Hoffman and Leonardo DiCaprio. Doing a cameo for his ""Scent of a Woman"" director Pacino gives new meaning to ""over the top"" and Walken similarly lets us know that its all in good fun. Solid tech contributions work toward a realistic feel. GigliProductionA Sony Pictures Entertainment release of a Revolution Studios presentation of a City Lights Films/Casey Silver production.

Peter says June 20 2016 at 949 am Seriously the ONLY positive review on Rotten Tomatoes Wow - what movie were you watching? ""Lopez and Affleck are thoroughly engaging in their smartly calibrated opposites"" - Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha huh? Reply Akindele K Afolabi says January 19 2016 at 846 pm I cant believe no one has commented in all these years. Your review of the ""film"" Gigli was rather disappointing. It was disappointing to see a publication as large as Variety to have an employee thats so incompetent at their job(which is to review movies and show an understanding of the film industry and help give a voice to the difference between quality amp; garbage) that they gave a positive review for the film. Sure there are certain seconds of certain scenes that can be viewed as somewhat positive but to claim that this piece of garbage is an overall positive film that will leave viewers speaking about it with any kind adjectives after suffering through a viewing of Gigli is insanity. This insanity only serves to highlight what poor taste judgement and opinions can be offered from this employee attempting to do their job. After giving Gigli an overall positive review I stand to claim that this so called movie critic has not a clue as to what theyre doing. Before any further embarrassment to themselves Variety Inc and the film industry as a whole I suggest immediate dismissal from your company and urge this employee to find a new line of work unless they want to be giving their future reviews with a URL that includes ""blogspot"" or some other free website generator whilst hoping that their web traffic for the day reaches double digits.

Too bad potential wedded bliss doesnt automatically translate into movie magic. Their new film ""Gigli"" falls somewhere between horrible and laughably awful. If the public wants to see what laid the foundation for Ben and Jens highly public lovefest then the public might well wonder if this movie like their show-and-tell togetherness should have remained just between the two of them. The title is the first of many irritations. It craves a joke a pun anything besides the last name of a frustrated low-level thug named Larry Gigli (rhymes with ""feely""). When other characters pronounce it wrong (""giggly"" ""jiggly"") you have to wonder what director Martin Brest best known for ""Midnight Run"" and ""Scent of a Woman"" was thinking. In fact having withstood this entire movie Im left wondering about a lot of things. Movie review View trailer 1/2 star ""Gigli"" with Ben Affleck Jennifer Lopez Justin Bartha. Written and directed by Martin Brest. 124 minutes. Rated R for language sexual content and violence. Several theaters. Larry (Affleck) is hired by an uptight mobster named Louis (Lenny Venito) to kidnap a federal prosecutors mentally challenged brother and use him as leverage to save a New York crime boss from prison without parole. Afflecks performance is so passively derivative throughout that it could be called a four-way tribute. He assumes a John Travolta-esque swagger and ""Grease""-style pompadour and speaks with a Matt Dillon-esque Brooklyn brogue (an overused expletive substitutes for any and all tough-guy nuance). He then lures poor brain-damaged Brian (Justin Bartha) from a mental hospital and suddenly hes aping Tom Cruises turn in ""Rain Man."" The most active part of Afflecks face is his James Caan-like set jaw which unfortunately only accentuates his chin dimple. J.Lo stars as Ricki a comely henchwoman whos tapped to keep an eye on Larry so he doesnt screw up the plan. She knows a thing or two about Chinese martial arts and how to drive Larry wild with desire Shes a lesbian. The three camp out at Larrys bachelor pad and take trips around L.A. in his Impala convertible. Ricki and Larry smile sideways at each other in the front seat as though trying not to laugh at Brian who quotes rap songs and asks where ""the Baywatch"" is (an urgent and recurrent request that never fully makes sense). What purports to be a screwball caper flick descends with each passing scene into an unfunny and at times offensive mess. Not only is Brians smiling twitching and nervous sunflower-eating used as a comic foil throughout but as a mental patient newcomer Bartha veers inconsistently from too dopey to too lucid. The script isnt kind to lesbians either. In fact the slurs against both populations come at the audience like fists. They actually take away from what little interest the story accumulates -- if indeed that is actually possible. Studded with several uncredited cameos youll hoot at the likes of Christopher Walken doing an evil eye as a tired cop and then again later for his daring to dip his big toe into this quagmire at all. Ben and Jens chemistry was apparently hot off the set and though the promise of palpable onscreen passion dangles around the lesbian plot twist it never amounts to anything more than shockingly dirty and poorly written verbal foreplay. Lopez radiates Jenny-from-the-block warmth but shes banished her come-hither tough girl to the ""Out of Sight"" DVD. Instead Ricki thrusts herself from one yoga pose to another while delivering a monologue on the merits of the female anatomy. A positively excruciating slow-mo sex scene follows. Disappointed fans of the happy couple can only figure that the real chemistry happened like it said in the tabloids -- everywhere else.

Starring Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez. Directed by Martin Brest. (R. 124 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Gigli"" doesnt need a review; it needs an inquest. The movie is dead on arrival. Who or what killed it? There are multiple suspects Was it the endless prattle? The ludicrously inappropriate soundtrack? The funereal pacing? The uneasy mix of vulgarity and cheap sentiment? The almost nonexistent story? The resounding miscasting of Ben Affleck as a tough guy and Jennifer Lopez as a woman whod actually speak to him? Or the bad bad bad bad writing? The answer This is one of those ""Murder on the Orient Express"" situations in which all the suspects are guilty. The result is the most thoroughly joyless and inept film of the year and one of the worst of the decade. Were talking about a disaster and not of the fun ""Showgirls"" variety either. ""Gigli"" is 124 minutes long almost a marathon by romantic-comedy standards. Yet if all the apparently irrelevant tiresome and flat-out painful moments were cut the film would consist entirely of two scenes -- one featuring a brief appearance by Christopher Walken as a (spooky) police detective and another with Al Pacino as a (screaming) crime boss. Even those scenes are nonsensical but the bravura turns of the veteran actors at least provide temporary distraction. ""Gigli"" seems intended to be a tale of redemption. Affleck plays the title character a strong-arm mob guy who finds a path out of his life of loneliness and violence when he falls in love with Ricki a beautiful lesbian mob contractor played by Lopez. Of course to make this transition at all meaningful we have to believe two things 1) that this fellow really has lived a nasty life and 2) that hes worth redeeming. But Afflecks essence is too good-natured for us to believe him as a cruel customer and in fact the movie starts by assuring us that hes basically a nice guy. So really theres nowhere for the character to go. Plus as written Gigli is such a dumbbell -- and Affleck is so distressingly convincing as a dumbbell -- that watching his character evolve is like watching mold grow. Gigli is assigned to kidnap the brain-damaged younger brother of a federal prosecutor -- newcomer Justin Bartha in a grotesque on-again off-again parody of mental affliction. Because Giglis boss isnt sure Gigli is up to the job he partners him with Ricki and soon the three are living together in Giglis apartment as a kind of mock family. Once that setup is in place the story grinds to a halt and what follows is about 90 minutes of a very stupid hero trying to talk a very uninterested heroine into sex. That Lopez survives ""Gigli"" (barely but she does) is due to the fact that she keeps smiling at Affleck indulgently as though he were a big fool and her smile seems to extend to the film as a whole. Ricki is too cool for Gigli just as Lopez is too cool for this movie. I just hope that Lopez doesnt see ""Gigli"" and decide that shes too cool for Affleck too. Watching the two of them together -- they reportedly fell in love during the making of the film -- I was reminded of an image two people in big winter coats kissing passionately feeling beautiful and not realizing that they look as clumsy as turtles. There are advantages that civilians have over movie stars and a big one is not having to look at ourselves. Director Martin Brest (""Scent of a Woman"") also wrote the screenplay though its hard to fathom that the unrelenting puerile sex talk found here -- dorm-room-like disquisitions on the relative attractiveness of the male and female organs and the words ""gobble gobble gobble"" as an amorous invitation -- could be the product of a mature imagination. But then who knows? In ""Gigli"" when the mentally challenged teenager says he loves ""Baywatch"" because ""thats where the sex is"" sentimental violins play on the soundtrack. And almost every time Gigli refers to his penis a soulful acoustic guitar is heard -- the penis theme as it were. This is a fairly demented film but not nearly demented enough to be interesting. Advisory This film contains sexual situations violence and nonstop coarse language.

"Affleck Lopez Flunk Chemistry 101 - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Killer Affleck Lopez Flunk Chemistry 101Movies - REVIEW - GigliA Potato Produces More Electricity Than This Real-life Pair On The Big Screen.August 1 2003|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticNot since Tracy and Hepburn . . .No thats a stretch.First it was Gable and Lombard Bogie and Bacall . . . and now Affleck and Lopez.Nah. Whom I kidding?One has to return to the storied love of Sean and Madonna to find a real-life romantic couple who light up the screen like Ben and J.Lo in Gigli.Thats about right.Gigli the new comic-tragic romance starring real-life lovers Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez is a relationship killer of a flop. Its a catastrophic miscalculation of tone a comatose comedy about mental illness contract killers and corpse desecration.And for the stars its a stunning blow to how cute they seem to think they are together. They strike too many poses stare off-camera in that meaningful ""soap-opera method"" style. They murder jokes and half-heart their way through tender moments and wear way too many outfits from the Hollywood hitman/woman collection.We hear Matt Damon has been trying to stop the happy couples impending nuptials. He must have seen Gigli. If they connect offscreen as well as they do on I see counseling in their future. And lawyers.Affleck stars as the idiotically named hit-man Larry Gigli pronounced ""Jeely like really."" Hes a scary dude -- or as scary as baby-faced Ben and his mobster hairstyle (hairpiece?) can make him.A thug played by Lenny Venito sends Larry to kidnap Rain Man or this movies version of him. Brian (Justin Bartha) is snatched from a ""special"" school. Larry keeps him in his apartment hoping to leverage the disabled kid-hostage into favorable treatment from his brother a federal prosecutor.Brian is off in the head but adorable profane and a hip-hop and Baywatch fan (make your own hip-hop or Baywatch joke here). And for the purposes of this movie hes calm and quiet whenever cops (Christopher Walken who should be pickier) or mobsters (Al Pacino who should be pickier) are nearby.Ricki (Lopez) is a va-voomy contract killer sent to stay with Brian and Larry basically to make sure Larry doesnt screw up. Shes forever doing yoga and reading ""Being Peace"" and ignoring Larry because shes a lesbian.The sparks between the stars wouldnt ignite an open gas can. They play this unintentionally silly seduction scene as if their whole sordid tabloid history were enough to make us care about characters so poorly developed that we dont believe either of them in their roles. Affleck rises to the dim-wit soft-hearted tough-guy occasion once. Were just supposed to accept Lopez as this tough-talking hardcase but her one or two tough-talking scenes dont cover that.The setup suggests that this will be something of a gender reversal comedy but steps in that direction are all flat-footed. Director Martin Brest did Midnight Run and Scent of a Woman both movies about odd couples tossed together to learn something about each other under stress. He never finds anything like the right tone here spattering brain matter all over a fish tank (and the fish eat it up) in one scene always reaching for laughs that never come.And if all that werent enough to scare you off heres a final five-word warning -- Lainie Kazan in a thong. The Big Fat Greek mama plays Larrys hip hippy and hopeful mom in a scene that comes closest to scoring a laugh.We can all be happy for Ben and Jens impending nuptials. But were allowed too to hope and wish that they never ever work together again. They may be really in love. But Gigli really stinks.

Running time 98 minutes. Rated R (language gore violence sex). At the Empire the Lincoln Square the Orpheum others. IT isnt the fault of Ben Affleck or Jennifer Lopez or any of their supporting cast that ""Gigli"" is such a stinker. The two stars do it turns out have ample on-screen chemistry and Lopez is actually better here than in any of her movies since ""Out of Sight."" The latter was like ""Get Shorty"" an adaptation of one of Elmore Leonards witty tough-guy novels. And the problem with ""Gigli"" is that it is an inept attempt to do Elmore Leonard by Martin Brest a filmmaker whose coarse sensibility makes him catastrophically unqualified to the task. In ""Gigli"" writer-director Brest (responsible for ""Meet Joe Black"") reveals a penchant for ugliness and vulgarity that was only hinted at in the ""poontang"" speech in his ""Scent of a Woman."" His is a sensibility so unpleasant especially when it deals with anything to do with sex that scene after scene makes you want to take a shower. His dialogue - and ""Gigli"" features some of the most embarrassing writing of any movie made in the last decade - is clearly supposed to express an earthy sexual sophistication. But - witness the now notorious ""gobble gobble"" invitation to oral sex - its just crude and clueless and reeks of loathing for both male and female sexuality. Afflecks Gigli is a dimwitted enforcer for an L.A. mobster; J.Los Ricki is a wise wry sexy literate enforcer sent to make sure he does his job properly. This job involves kidnapping a mentally handicapped youth (Justin Bartha who looks like a young clone of Chris ODonnell) to put pressure on the boys father a federal prosecutor. (Were never told precisely whats wrong with the young man but it appears to be a combination of mental retardation and Tourettes syndrome.) It isnt clear if the material involving the kidnapped boy (all of it shamelessly ripped off from ""Rain Man"") is supposed to be funny or disturbing. In the end its too trite to be moving but it casts a depressing shadow on the romance and the comedy. There is nothing unexpected or interesting in the way the two mobsters fall for each other or the way Afflecks characters essential decency beneath a callous immature exterior is brought out by his interactions with his young hostage. Lopezs character doesnt undergo any change at all but like Madonna in the execrable ""The Next Best Thing"" the singer/actress gets to show off her yoga moves and toned muscles at some length. She looks terrific but even her remarkable sex appeal isnt enough to distract you from the idiocies coming out of her mouth. In the movies one genuinely enjoyable sequence Christopher Walken (as a detective) sends a blast of fresh air across the movies general rancidness even though its a bizarre performance over the top even for him. And in another supporting role Al Pacino is back in the eye-popping shouty mode that reached its nadir in Brests ""Scent of a Woman."" All the characters - including those who are supposed to be L.A. born and bred - have Noo Yawk accents as if thats the way all criminals speak.

Liam Lacey From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 01 2003 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Mar. 20 2009 952PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Gigli Written and directed by Martin Brest Starring Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez Classification 18A Rating  This summer the celebrity magazine and TV entertainment shows have produced a purgatorial monotony of data on the canoodlings of movie stars all of whom happen to be promoting new films. A half-century after the end of the studio system and its publicity manipulations the use of celebrities sex lives real or invented to sell tickets is brazenly back in style. On the eve of the Charlies Angels sequel Demi Moore grabs headlines for dating a sitcom star who could be her son. Angelina Jolie remembers shes lesbian-positive in time to promote the Lara Croft sequel. Loudest and busiest of all is the churning publicity machine linking the upcoming nuptials of Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck to their new comedy Gigli. Sometimes this celebrity hype ends up biting itself on its own backside. The predictable virulence of forthcoming reviews for Gigli will undoubtedly be interpreted as a backlash but thats not the real story. Quite apart from anyones feelings about their blandness wealth good looks and questionable acting gifts Affleck and Lopez have made a truly awful movie together. This is not just ordinary bad in a Bad Boys II sort of way but a hypnotic black hole of a movie that sucks reputations careers and goodwill down its vortex. Rarely has a movie that doesnt star Madonna achieved such a skin-crawling mixture of deluded preening and bungled humour. The creator of Gigli is director-writer Martin Brest ( Meet Joe Black Scent of a Woman) who attempts to recreate one of the mismatched buddy comedies of the eighties ( Beverly Hills Cop Midnight Run). Affleck plays a low-level Italian-American enforcer living in Los Angeles who is named Larry Gigli. To signify his retro macho values he wears striped bowling shirts and a pompadour of a Grease extra shrugs and waves his hands and shouts a lot. In the mob world he inhabits apparently devoid of other Italian-Americans or opera fans no one can pronounce his surname which he explains ""rhymes with really. "" Soon the humour really begins to ferment. Giglis perpetually irascible boss Lou (Lenny Venito) assigns him to kidnap the teenaged brain-damaged younger brother (Justin Bartha) of the district attorney in an attempt to pressure him to drop charges against a New York gang boss. The boy named Brian is a source of instant hilarity . He explodes in outbursts of obscenities quoting rap lyrics verbatim (including of course Sir Mix-A-Lots buttocks-celebrating Baby Got Back) and pursuing his ambition to visit ""the Baywatch"" which he assumes to be a reality television show. Back at his one-bedroom apartment Gigli yells at Brian who spouts obscenities back until the doorbell rings. Enter Jennifer Lopez revealing front and back cleavage in low-riders and pushup bra. She calls herself Ricki and she has been sent by Lou to make sure that Gigli doesnt screw up his assignment. Almost instantly she confuses Gigli and the audience too. Who is she really supposed to be beyond an implausible plot device? Lopez unlike the persistently awkward Affleck at least has the seducers talent for controlling pace though her constant smirk and lisp are impediments to the wordy clumsy monologue shes required to deliver. Her character devoid of any plausible history quotes Sun Tzu and threatens unruly teenagers by sashaying up to them in her miniskirt and describing a fictional martial-arts move that tears out the visual cortex and deprives its victim of all visual memory. At about the halfway point in Gigli the procedure sounds tempting. Ricki also declares she is a lesbian which means its going to be a little harder for Gigli to sleep with her. (Along with Chasing Amy Gigli now makes Affleck Hollywoods number one lesbian converter). In defence of her sexual orientation Ricki performs yoga exercises in which she lies on the floor spreads her legs like a spitted chicken and does a long speech about the wonders of the vagina. While the couple are hanging around the apartment engaging in long arguments about the merits of their genitalia they are occasionally interrupted. Christopher Walken shows up as a cop in a typical self-parodying cameo talking about aliens and abductions and punching out words with his usual lurching emphasis and giving you the sense he may have seen his dialogue five minutes before shooting it. The scene is ridiculous but you keep half-hoping he might return to lend some spark. Events finally get some dramatic push when Lou calls announcing hed like to have Brians thumb sent to his older brother while Ricki and Gigli find they have developed some affection for their little prisoner. This leads to a scene with Al Pacino as the New York mobster in which he gives his younger colleagues a lesson in truly large-scale bad acting. At first Pacino vamps like a swish fashion designer and then spends the rest of the scene bellowing. Pacinos uncurbed excesses raise questions about exactly where the fault in Gigli lies. Writer-director Brest has never made a worse movie but apart from the movies wordy tasteless dialogue awkward pacing and tacked-on ending the biggest failing is the misguided celebrity casting. Both Affleck and Lopez are light-as-a-bubble presences enjoyable when balanced with stronger actors or when serving an assertive director but theyre hopelessly out of place in a character-driven black comedy. By the end of the movie they actually earn sympathy. Sure their celebrity charms may sell magazines and promote talk shows but here Ben and Jen seem as comfortable as a couple of kittens thrown into a rain barrel.

"Gigli This Star Vehicle Is A Lemon washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living >> Follow Style On Gigli This Star Vehicle Is A Lemon Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday August 1 2003 Ben and Jen? After seeing ""Gigli"" I think Ben and Jerry could make a better movie. ""Gigli"" is certainly bereft of low pleasures Its both giggle-free and jiggle-free. Worse its enervated torpid slack dreary and oh yes nasty brutish and long. Summed up in a bumper sticker it would come out as Have you hugged your kidnapper today? Ach. Oy. Woe and poo bleccch and uck ZZZZZ-zzz. Ben (Affleck) plays Larry and Jen (Lopez) plays Ricki. Both are um ""contractors"" meaning facilitators for certain mob transactions against private citizens that call for the use of force. Before the world went all icky touchy-feely on us they used to be called ""enforcers"" and before that ""thugs."" Anyhow they are ordered (by separate clients) to kidnap the brain-damaged brother of a federal prosecutor who is putting the heat on a New York mobster. They are to hold that sad wounded boy whose painful autism is played for chuckles and yuks as a means of leveraging the prosecutor to back off though that whole part of the story is left undramatized except as justification for a late showy cameo by Al Pacino. But most of the movie is Ben and Jen spatting attitudinizing and improvising in a poorly decorated L.A. apartment to the pretend delight of the poor boy impersonated by Justin Bartha who has spent entirely too much time watching Dustin Hoffman in ""Rain Man."" Regardless of the off-screen reality Ben and Jen have very little electricity on-screen. Hes locked into a shameless pasty John Travolta imitation while shes -- well shes -- hmmm. I dont know what shes doing. Whatever it is its not terribly amusing. But thats okay because shes very poorly dressed and barely awake. This is her snooziest performance ever if ""performance"" is quite the word. She can barely be stirred to wipe the sleep out of her eyes. In fact the whole grotesque thing feels like a movie originally written for Sean Penn and Madonna in their brief fling at celebrity dating. Its about on a level with ""Shanghai Surprise"" the only celluloid residue of the Penn-Madonna linkage. But I still think Penn and Madonna would have had the higher wisdom to nix this project. The criminal mind behind this is Martin Brest who hit the bigs many years back with ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and has been desperately trying to make it back to the smalls ever since. He may have finally made it. Its even worse than his last film ""Meet Joe Black"" which many considered his worst. The movie has no structure at all no sense of urgency no compelling reason to exist or be endured whatsoever. The scenes play on and on and on and the story wends down byways of no consequence whatsoever. In one scene Lopezs former lover shows up and commits a gaudy mock-suicide with razor blades over the loss of her serene majesty. The lover I should add is female for the Lopez character is a self-announced lesbian. So in the middle of the strangely sluggish film we have one scene of screaming scenery- eating culminating in a bloody act of self-mutilation. This is followed by an emergency room scene and then by . . . nothing. It connects with nothing. It means nothing. It was simply an audition by the obscure actress Missy Crider. Theres another disconnected tidbit in which Lopezs character launches into one of those speeches we doubt ever got speechified Its a poetic invocation of oral sex and what is remarkable about it is that using incredible discipline Brest is able to force himself to build a scene around a part of her body other than her butt Now thats a pro Equally feckless are cameos by two great actors Christopher Walken and the aforementioned Pacino. Each is gaudy and explosive and so meaningless as to be instantly forgettable. In fact I had so totally repressed the appearance of Walken that it slipped into my unconsciousness and only a friends mention recalled it. But what is most appalling about this whole appalling thing is its complete disinterest in the victim of the plot it chronicles so listlessly. It never acknowledges really that for an autistic child such an event would be shattering. Instead hes played for laughs as a kind of punching bag for Affleck and as an object of reduction and condescension for Lopez. This tough treatment improves him and of course improves them too. Hes the therapist not them. Its really all about them you see. But these days . . . what isnt? Gigli (124 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for extreme language -- every other amp;% word -- and some skin-showing intimacy between its two stars.

"In Gigli Ben and Jen Corner the Bull Market washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids In Gigli Ben and Jen Corner the Bull Market Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday August 1 2003 IN ""GIGLI"" Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck have a sustained argument about whose sexual apparatus is actually sexier male or female. They discuss power politics in romantic relationships -- as in whos da big tough bull and whos you know the submissive cow? When theyre not fighting cute theyre flexing cute. A shirtless Affleck checks out his bis and tris in the mirror Travis Bickle style before hopping into bed with J-Lo who performs leg-stretching exercises purely designed to showcase her contours. Whatever they do of course is lit up like a Rembrandt painting. As if you hadnt figured this out already the movie written and directed by Martin (""Beverly Hills Cop"") Brest is basically an oglefest for die-hard fans of J-Lo and Ben-Yo. The story? Puh-leez. Larry Gigli (Affleck) a reluctant incompetent hood for a splenetic gangster named Louis (Lenny Venito) has been ordered to kidnap and baby-sit Brian (Justin Bartha) the autistic younger brother of a federal prosecutor who can keep Larrys uberboss (Al Pacino) out of jail. This is meant to be one of those offers a prosecutor cant refuse. Louis doesnt trust Larry to do the job right so he sends a real pro to baby-sit him. That would be Ricki (Lopez) -- at least thats what she calls herself. She may act sweet but shes a contract killer when she needs to be. Larrys none too thrilled about holing up in his apartment with a kid who talks like ""Rain Man"" and a female who calls all the shots but its only a matter of time before he becomes very interested in his attractive companion. That is until he learns shes not interested in his gender. The rest is negotiation and I dont mean between the Mafia and the prosecutor. Larry does his best to persuade Ricki to as he puts it ""hop the fence."" She just broke up with a girlfriend and shes not completely against the idea but first they have to argue about bulls and cows. Apparently the filmmakers want guys to show up for this thing so they have filled the movie with grittiness violence and tough talk. Larry whos meant to be a politically incorrect paisano swears up a storm insults Brian and tries to tell Ricki whos da boss. (Lets just say hes a performance short of an Oscar nomination.) And to further entice the male gallery there are cameos from Christopher Walken as an intimidating detective and Pacino as a psychotic gangster who smiles first and blows out brains afterward. If the bull is supposed to be the dominant one then Lopez definitely wears the horns in this celebrity meadow. But she wins this battle with a soft touch subtle forms of intimidation and quotations from Sun Tzus ""The Art of War."" Afflecks the one who strips his shirt surrenders the most becomes the butt of the jokes and accepts J-Lo as his own personal savior. Which I guess makes him the cow. Guys Im telling you Dont go to this movie Its ""Chasing Amy"" with guns Youre walking into a trap This is for fans of the holy couple but they already know that. GIGLI (R 124 minutes) -- Contains violence sexual situations and pervasive obscenity. Area theaters.

For the rest of us that isnt much of a recommendation. Separately Affleck and Lopez have rarely given better than passable performances. (This is especially true of Lopez who acts about as well as she sings.) Together they present an insurmountable challenge for a film that was saddled with a bum script from the beginning. Excellent actors support the stars but not even Al Pacino Christopher Walken and Lainie Kazan can help when nobody knows how to use them. Their characters each have a clear purpose. Walkens is to rachet up the tension. Pacinos character commits an act that turns the story in a new direction. Kazan is supposed to add shading to Afflecks character. They appear for one scene then vanish. It feels as if writer-director Martin Brest started the script by putting scenes on note cards then forgot to weave them together. As a director Brest is responsible for Scent of a Woman Midnight Run and Beverly Hills Cop. The movies he wrote are largely forgotten. Now we know why. Afflecks character Larry Gigli (pronounced GEE-lee) is an enforcer for a tough-talking mobster who conducts his business meetings on the sidewalk outside a Los Angeles restaurant. Its a mystery how Gigli got started in this line of work because hes a pussycat. Ordered to kidnap the mentally handicapped brother of a federal prosecutor Gigli hides the kid Brian (newcomer Justin Bartha) at his apartment. Suddenly Ricki (Lopez) appears. The boss sent her because he doesnt trust Gigli to handle things alone. Gigli tries to establish whos boss but mangles his lines which feel swiped from an Ice Cube movie. He throws down. He says bring it on. The man can represent because hes ""the original pimp gangstas gangsta."" Its all right to laugh. After seeing the movie it comes as a surprise to learn Brests intentions from the production notes. He wanted Gigli to come across as a ""mean angry and unsympathetic"" character who comes to realize hes not the person he imagined himself to be. That might make an interesting movie but Gigli doesnt come close. Its as confused as its main character is supposed to be. Its language is raw but the characters mostly come off as sweet. Ricki is a lesbian but this is a heterosexual love story. Humor involving Brian is supposed to feel edgy -- it isnt nice to make fun of the handicapped after all -- but much of it just feels awkward. Gigli only does one mean thing and it is so at odds with the prevailing tone that it makes us flinch. Ricki sees through his mask which isnt hard to do. The love scene is painful to watch. The film tries a neat trick by switching masculine-feminine roles but it doesnt work. The movie tries too hard to be edgy to work as a sweet romance yet lacks the courage to push as hard as it needs to. With the good-looking Lopez and Affleck starring Gigli is always watchable but factoring out the eye candy its only worth watching at two points. The first time is when Walken playing a suspicious police detective pays Gigli a visit. The scene feels as if Brest threw it in out of necessity. The audience needs to see that the police are on the case and having cop and kidnapping victim in the same apartment could have injected some much-needed dramatic tension. But Walken who specializes in off-kilter performances gives one of his strangest. His monologue is full of odd pauses wild looks and crazy rhythms. Time stops when he enters the room. We wonder what planet he hails from. Nothing else of interest happens until near the end when Pacino appears as a ruthless mobster. He out-Walkens Walken moving constantly casting wary glances his voice and face at odds with his words and actions. When these men are on screen Affleck and Lopez disappear. Kazan who plays Giglis mother also eclipses the principal actors but shes forced to interact with the stars whereas Walken and Pacino are on their own wavelengths. Pacinos character is upset because kidnapping a federal prosecutors brother can do nothing but intensify pressure from the authorities. Strangely however that one appearance by Walken is the only hint anybody cares. For the most part Gigli Ricki and Brian seem to exist in a cocoon untouched by the outside world. Of course they become an ersatz family albeit one destined to break apart. A lesbian a mamas boy and a kidnapped mentally challenged child on the lam -- there should be a story in such an unconventional family. But Brest either never found the story or wasnt able to put it on screen. Grade C- Todays Deals GameStop Summer Sale Banana Republic Final Cut Sale Up to 75% off + free shipping...

Lo and Ben when the highlight of their first movie together is a surprise histrionic appearance by that old yeller Al Pacino. His entrance about two-thirds of the way through Gigli finally injects some familiar energy into this embarrassing debacle. A bum steer Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck flunk chemistry in Gigli. Gigli is the rare movie that never seems to take off but also never seems to end. It tries hard to titillate but ends up making audiences want to avert their eyes. Review of the movie Gigli ( out of four) Stars Jennifer Lopez Ben Affleck Justin Bartha Director Martin Brest Distributor Columbia Pictures Rating R for sexual content pervasive language and brief strong violence. Opens today nationwide Ben Affleck playing the low-rent hood Gigli kidnaps a retarded teenager. When the task threatens to become too tough reinforcement arrives glam lesbian Ricki (Jennifer Lopez). Of course she succumbs to his wily charms. The stars preen for the camera but strike no sparks with each other. Theres no question that Lopez knows how to steam things up Check out her scenes with George Clooney in 1998s Out of Sight. But Affleck had more chemistry with buddy Matt Damon in Good Will Hunting than he does with Lopez whom he met while making this film and now is his fiancee. Maybe its because Lopez appears so in love with herself that theres no room for anyone else. She shows off her curves through a variety of yoga postures and other self-consciously suggestive moves while Affleck looks on sometimes in a dumb leer sometimes in a calculated approximation of desire. Gigli aspires to the comic noir style of the Elmore Leonard adaptations Get Shorty and Out of Sight. The intent one imagines was to integrate black humor and sexy banter with some shatteringly violent moments. But what emerges is desperate -- and occasionally offensive -- salaciousness merged with corny predictable jokes. Supporting actor Justin Bartha must have watched Rain Man a few hundred times to nail his performance as Brian a cheery lad with occasional bouts of Tourettes syndrome interspersed with moments of comic wisdom. When he obsesses over his favorite show ""the Baywatch"" he sounds as if hes channeling Dustin Hoffmans Judge Wapner-loving Raymond. Still Bartha is a good deal more engaging than our not-so-dynamic duo. When Bartha requests a bedtime story (""it soothes me down"" he explains innocently) Affleck mocks him reading aloud from a Tabasco sauce label and a Charmin toilet paper wrapper. See he has no books in his house. A rare illuminating moment in Gigli comes when we learn the proper pronunciation Gigli rhymes with ""really."" Or is it silly? No big deal-y.

"Giglis faults more than a couple - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEWS Giglis faults more than a coupleAugust 01 2003|Manohla Dargis | Times Staff Writer Nearly as unwatchable as it is unpronounceable the gangster comedy ""Gigli"" arrives in theaters amid a public relations tempest. As anyone within reach of the worldwide flack-net knows the film stars real-life paramours Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez who stung by bad publicity about the feature have vowed never to work with each other again. First though the pair should reconsider working with anyone who thought well of a movie hinged on jokes about the disabled switch-hitting lesbians and the sight of a dead mans brain splattered across an aquarium.So forget the hype -- this movie would stink even without its big-ticket stars which isnt to say that either is entirely blameless. Affleck plays a low-level Los Angeles hood whose surname rhymes with ""really"" and Lopez plays Ricki an underworld contractor brought in to ensure that he doesnt screw up a job. Giglis immediate boss Louis (Lenny Venito) has ordered his reluctant minion to kidnap the mentally handicapped Brian (newcomer Justin Bartha) the young brother of a federal prosecutor whos causing them business trouble. After luring the kid out of his group home Gigli retreats to his bachelors pad whereupon he Brian and Ricki become the spurious misfit family so beloved of contemporary Hollywood while the movie grinds to a thudding stop.For the next 40 minutes or so Gigli and Ricki swap stale banter as the actors feign animosity and Bartha sneaks off with the movie by channeling Dustin Hoffmans ""Rain Man"" shtick. Throughout the strained repartee the jokes keep coming and bombing but its not as if the movie is devoid of humor. Its fairly risible when Ricki quotes Sun Tzu by heart and equally gag-worthy when without a shred of conviction she declares shes a lesbian just before snuggling in bed next to Gigli. A protracted scene in which the camera and Gigli both leer at Rickis wobbly yoga moves as she sings the praises of the female anatomy has irrefutable camp value as does an inevitable seduction capped by the memorable line ""its turkey time -- gobble gobble."" Yes it certainly is.After a well-regarded student movie and a couple of misses Brest hit it big as a director by staying out of Eddie Murphys way in ""Beverly Hills Cop."" He subsequently scored with ""Midnight Run"" which he followed with the more serious ""Scent of a Woman"" and ""Meet Joe Black"" both studio-slick and strictly impersonal. The new film marks a return to a more overtly comic register for Brest -- this is the first movie hes taken a writing credit on since his 1979 caper ""Going in Style"" -- which in keeping with movie-comedy fashion mostly involve forced stabs at ostensible ""politically incorrect"" waggery. The insults about Brian being a ""half-wit"" are crudely unfunny and made all the more painful by Brests steady attempts to reduce his stings with sentimentalism.Unlike the Farrelly brothers Brest doesnt embrace his bad taste -- he flees from it. Every time Gigli hurls another insult at Brian Brest and his team cue up a syrupy riff just to let us know that no one on board really thinks the kid is stupid. The frantic backpedaling seems a bid to put the thug into a better light but it doesnt. Gigli weighs in as such an insufferable lunkhead that its difficult to think of an actor who could pull him off without shifting the whole movie into pure caricature. A passable actor but a lousy star -- the bigger the movie the worse he comes across -- Affleck doesnt have the chops or the charm to maneuver around (or past) bad material and unlike his co-star he cant coast on looks alone.If Lopez fares somewhat better its only because her lines arent as egregious and her beauty affords its own pleasurable dividends. Shes as badly miscast as her sapphic warrior is ludicrously conceived but because her well-manicured persona carries so much extra-added value -- Puffy The Rump Ben and Jen -- Lopez ends up being a welcome distraction a voluptuary of attractions. Thats especially true once the characters hit the street and the story spirals ever further south. Much like Christopher Walken and Al Pacino both of whom stop by for a pair of resplendently eccentric too-brief appearances Lopez proves her big-screen worth mainly by making you forget the movie. When youre this fabulous it just doesnt matter if youre any good.GIGLIMPAA rating R for sexual content pervasive language and brief strong violenceTimes guidelines The language is raw the sex is tame and the violence certainly isnt brief.Ben Affleck...Larry GigliJennifer Lopez...RickiJustin Bartha...BrianAl Pacino...StarkmanChristopher Walken...JacobellisRevolution Studios presents a City Light Films/Casey Silver Production released by Columbia Pictures.

Connoisseurs of the Eastern discipline however may be startled by the limber stars salty discourse as she bends writhes and gets buffly spiritual in a thing called Gigli.Introducing herself as Ricki Lopez can be found giving Ben Affleck - who plays a dim-bulb hit man - a lecture on how and where women like to be pleasured. Ricki who turns out to be mob-connected herself is talking in rather colorful detail about various erogenous zones and hot spots of the female form. And then she does a very nice peacock pose.This soft-core yogic moment is immensely - albeit unintentionally - funny as Lopez flexes her gluteals and coos provocatively while Affleck looking as if someone just lodged a BB pellet between the eyes gazes on agape and stupefied.Agape and stupefied are good words to describe how audiences will likely feel upon exiting Gigli - a torpid dud starring the cuddly celebrity twosome of the moment. Sprung from the mind of writer-director Martin Brest Gigli is an ostensibly comedic crime-world romance about a hood (Affleck) who goes around correcting everyones mangling of his surname (its pronounced with soft gs as in Geely ""rhymes with really"") and who ends up baby-sitting a ""psychologically challenged"" hostage.Ricki has likewise been assigned to guard this autistic abductee Brian. A poor mans Raymond Babbitt (Dustin Hoffmans Rain Man character) he has been kidnapped as leverage for a mob boss facing charges in federal court. As portrayed by Justin Bartha (think Big-era Tom Hanks) Brian is a twitchy damaged soul whose eyes light up at the thought of the buxom bikinied lifeguards of Baywatch. Bartha spends the movie flinching squinting and yelping ""the Baywatch"" over and over again. It is not pretty.Afflecks Gigli cant believe his good fortune when the bare-midriffed miss shows up at his door but hes soon struck dumb by the revelation that the beautiful Ricki is a lesbian. And so Gigli whose first name is Larry spends the rest of the movie trying to get his new partner in crime to ""hop the fence.""Theres lots of putatively suggestive chitchat about men and women bulls and cows (and a turkey - dont ask) and how Afflecks mobster dude would look swell in mascara. Gigli apparently wants to say something about gender roles and sexual experimentation. Its titillation with a thump.Lopez in a scene in which she flirts with a female store clerk is hardly believable - but at least the actress appears game. Affleck for his part behaves as if a Zero from Pearl Harbor dropped one too close to his noggin. He looks permanently shell-shocked.Gigli stops dead in its tracks for a couple of lazily over-the-top cameos by two master hambones Christopher Walken and Al Pacino. Pacino won an Oscar under Brests guidance in Scent of a Woman and the actor doing some serious shtick here throws in everything but the kitchen sink - and the ""hoo-ha"" that nabbed him his Academy Award as an arrogant blind ex-Army colonel a a decade ago.Riding a Chevy Impala convertible around L.A. Affleck Lopez and the guy blurting ""the Baywatch"" from the backseat take in the sights and run across a few sinister types. There is also an encounter with Lainie Kazan who shows up as Giglis mom and presumably knows how to pronounce his name.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.Gigli  (out of four stars)Produced by Casey Silver and Martin Brest written and directed by Brest photography by Robert Elswit music by John Powell distributed by Columbia Pictures.Running time 2 hours 2 mins.Larry Gigli. . .

With Ben Affleck Jennifer Lopez Justin Bartha Christopher Walken Al Pacino. Written produced and directed by Martin Brest. Running time 124 mins. Rated R Language partial nudity sexual situations violence. 1 Star. Gigli"" is a disaster. Although Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez fell in love while making this crude black comedy which opens tomorrow they play unappetizing characters who deserve each other only because no one else would have them. The one thing the movie has going for it is as my dearly departed grandmother might have observed of J.Lo ""That girls kishkes are hanging out"" She would have used the Yiddish slang for guts to account for the copious amount of bare flesh that pours from Lopezs low-rider jeans as she portrays a supposedly deadly mob enforcer. (Where does she pack her gun?) But like the stuffed-intestine delicacy by the same name ""Gigli"" clearly has been chopped and re-formed in a vain attempt to appeal to a fan base that craves a Cinderella story. The impending nuptials of Lopez and Affleck lead the public to expect a romantic comedy with a happily-ever-after ending. However the script by writer-director-producer Martin Brest looks as if it began life as a crime drama with a heart. It has since morphed into a comedy without a pulse. Affleck plays Larry Gigli (rhymes as he often tells people with ""really"") a caricature of a low-level goombah. Under instructions he has kidnapped a federal judges younger brother in an attempt to influence the outcome of a mob trial. Lopez plays a thug-ette named Ricki who helps Larry baby-sit the kidnap victim a mildly autistic lad who dials up Australian weather reports and who wants to visit ""the Baywatch"" an idea of heaven on earth he got from the TV show because ""I think thats where the sex is."" In a ""Rain Man"" sort of way the boy grows on his two kidnappers and we know this because the music on the soundtrack inappropriately soars and swells as if willing the audience to melt in tears. When Larry and Ricki are instructed by a crime boss to cut off the kids thumb as evidence of how much they are not to be trifled with the two realize theyre not cut out for a gangland career after all. A ridiculous and unamusing sequence ensues as Larry carves a substitute thumb off a stiff at the morgue. Romantic comedies must offer the main couple an obstacle to overcome and ""Gigli"" has one that would appear to be a deal-breaker Ricki prefers women. She not only prefers them she rhapsodizes over their body parts in unflinching detail. Even if Ricki werent a lesbian she is clearly disgusted by all things Larry. She sneers at him and lampoons him for proclaiming things like ""In every relationship there is a bull and a cow."" In this relationship there is also a turkey. When Ricki finally dares Larry to show his stuff in bed the resulting sequence could charitably be called a mercy mission. Two cameo appearances in ""Gigli"" are so odd and gratuitous were just going to pretend they never happened. One involves Christopher Walken who deconstructs his dialogue into component words and then delivers them in some sort of salute to Kafka. The other involves Al Pacino who is under the misconception that he is in a decibel contest. Thanks to a new ending that was tacked on to increase its shelf life ""Gigli"" offers an amazing cure for homosexuality. How could scientists shrinks and lesbians everywhere have missed this? The cure is ... Ben Affleck Something about him makes lesbians want to ""hop the fence."" What could that be? It is surely not his acting ability. E-mail Jamibernaol.com SIDEBAR SAVE 10 amp; YOUR DIGNITY There are so many bad moments in ""Gigli"" its a shame to single out only a few. But so you will be able to talk about the movie without actually having to see it here are just some the worst offenders LAINIE KAZANS BUTT Larry Gigli has to give his loudmouth mother an injection (insulin maybe?) and grabs her butt cheeks in full dismaying closeup. ""BABY GOT BACK"" The autistic boy Larry has kidnapped likes to learn the lyrics of rap songs even though he doesnt understand them. Hence he bursts out with ""I like big butts and I cannot lie"" GOBBLE GOBBLE Heres the start of the big sex scene Confirmed lesbian Ricki lies back on the bed with her legs spread and instructs Larry ""Turkey time Gobble gobble"" DOWN DOG J.Lo demonstrates her yogic expertise on a sticky mat where she goes through a lot of demanding revealing contortions while explaining in clinical detail why her character loves the female body and detests a certain male part which is ""like a slug."" FRIGHTENING NEMO After a gangster shoots a hole through the head of one of his lackeys the blood and brain matter spill into a nearby fishtank where the fishies begin to nibble. WRIST-SLICING FOR FUN When Rickis lesbian lover pitches a fit and slashes her wrists the scene is edited for comic potential.

Story Tools VIDEO Gigli starring Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez is taking a beating from entertainment critics across the country. CNNs Peter Viles reports. (August 1) PLAY VIDEO (CNN) -- OK so ""Gigli"" is not the worst film in years. That dubious title still goes to ""Swept Away"" or maybe ""Freddy Got Fingered."" But ""Gigli"" is still a huge waste of celluloid. In Hollywood its all about ""what have you done lately"" and despite such successes as ""Scent of a Woman"" ""Midnight Run"" and ""Beverly Hills Cop"" writer/director/producer Martin Brest has done nothing that can make up for this ill-conceived mess. If miscasting was a crime this movie would be proof of a felony. Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez fit their characters like a glove -- if the glove in question belonged to O.J. Simpson. Affleck plays a low-level mob enforcer named Larry Gigli (pronounced like ""really"") assigned to kidnap a mentally challenged young man Brian (think Raymond in ""Rainman"") played amazingly well by Justin Bartha in his feature film debut. Afflecks real-life lady love Lopez (they met during the filming of this movie) plays Ricki another mob enforcer hired to keep an eye on Gigli. Insult upon insult It seems Brians brother is a powerful federal prosecutor who is after a mob boss played by Al Pacino. The plan is for the prosecutor to drop the charges against the gangster in order to get his brother back safe and sound. Say what? In what universe? Of course Ricki and Larry fight like cats and dogs and hate each other from the get-go -- a sure sign that theyll be under the sheets by the second reel. And they are despite the fact that Ricki is a lesbian. Lopez plays a lesbian hitwoman sent to keep an eye on Afflecks hitman Gigli in ""Gigli."" Yes ladies and gentlemen Ben Affleck who already did this in ""Chasing Amy"" is at it again. Hes become ""Benny the lesbian changer"" the new secret weapon for the religious right. In all fairness the ending was changed at the last minute after massive negative audience reactions in test screenings. This however is only the final insult after a film full of them. There were obviously many changes made during the making of this cinematic train wreck. The story is all over the place there is one really strange scene with Christopher Walken playing a cop and then we never see him again. Hes on the cutting room floor. Wishing he were there too is Pacino who appears in only one embarrassing scene. Beyond the cringe But the award for the most cringe-inducing moment goes to Lopez for a scene in which she stretches out on the floor in every sexual position known to man while debating the pros and cons of female and male anatomy. I know it sounds hot on paper doesnt it? The bad guy characters become good guys with no motivation nor any visible cause or effect. None of the scenes seem to be connected to each other in any way; the entire film feels like it was edited on an assembly line without feeling for rhythm or nuance. At one point Rickis lesbian lover breaks into their ""hideout"" and tries to commit suicide. After comforting her in the hospital Ricki runs back and jumps in the sack with the ""lesbian changer."" This is a comedy? Brest showed such great promise in the 1980s with hit after hit as mentioned above. Then in 1998 he gave us ""Meet Joe Black."" Now hes given us ""Gigli."" He should remember that California is a ""three strikes and youre out"" state for criminal offenders. ""Gigli"" opens nationwide on Friday August 1 and is rated R.

"Sappy together - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Sappy togetherAugust 01 2003|By Mark Caro.Put together enough pointless random details and you get ""Gigli"" a movie thats less incompetent than bewildering. Writer-director Martin Brest somehow thought combining the most incongruous elements of ""Chasing Amy"" ""Rain Man"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" was a good idea.Try this on ""Gigli"" is the heartwarming tale of mob henchman Larry (Ben Affleck) who falls for curvaceous lesbian Ricki (Jennifer Lopez) hired to keep an eye on him while he guards the mentally challenged young guy hes kidnapped so his boss can extort a federal prosecutor.When Larry and Ricki start talking every other word starts with an ""F."" But soon the would-be couples conversations resemble rambling therapy sessions with Dr. Phil Ricki thinks Larry is sad. Larry just doesnt get the lesbian thing.Then theres Brian (Justin Bartha) one of those mentally challenged characters that movies like to portray as innocent man-children rather than as three-dimensional humans. When he smiles Brest never fails to thrust the camera right up to his face. At such moments the orchestral score becomes coated in so much syrup it could open its own IHOP franchise.Not an unskilled writer Brest has crafted some decent scenes. In one Ricki offers a literate if raunchy explanation of the difference between ""sure"" and ""yes."" In another Christopher Walken provides a laugh as a police detective with the air of someone who cant remember which body part itches.But you never lose awareness that youre watching something written as opposed to something that actually happened. Nary a note rings true.You sense the actor and filmmaker straining to be-- whats that annoying word?--edgy. The result is as convincing as Pat Boone covering N.W.A. songs. R.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet There arent many reasons to see the talky spark-free gangland romantic comedy Gigli but intrepid moviegoers should at least try to slip in and catch one scene before shuffling off to Seabiscuit or Terminator 3. That scene comes shortly after loudmouthed enforcer Ben Affleck spends his first night with Justin Bartha (the kidnapped developmentally disabled brother of a federal judge Afflecks bosses want to influence) and Jennifer Lopez (a lesbian fellow contractor assigned to make sure Affleck does the job right). Playing a police detective Christopher Walken shows up for some unannounced intimidation. In a few short minutes his scene spotlights the range of his talent as he veers from scary to funny to bizarre then back again. Unfortunately he feels like an old pro condescending to stop by for amateur night. Sure writer-director Martin Brest lends the film a professional sheen and his stars (who some rumors suggest may have become romantically involved) have charisma to spare but the film has all the charge and momentum of a Paxil ad. In what passes for chemistry Lopez smirks while Affleck yells in a voice borrowed from early John Travolta roles. He delivers a monologue about how every relationship has a bull and a cow. She counters his bluster with quotes from Sun Tzu though the film lets her killing skills like her sexuality remain mostly a matter of hearsay. Apart from the painful anticipation of waiting for Bartha-a newcomer who seems to have seen Rain Man once or twice-to demand a trip to see ""the Baywatch"" or bust into another impromptu rap the tension comes from Afflecks inability to score with Lopez whose professed sexual preference lasts longer against Afflecks charms than Joey Lauren Adams does in Chasing Amy but not by much. To be fair Brest seems to have set out to make a film exploring such sexual vagaries a theme his characters discuss repeatedly and at great length. But it would be a lot easier to appreciate what the film works toward if it ever came close to getting there. Instead the dialogue sounds as unconvincing as the action it sets up a fatal flaw for a film thats essentially all talk. Neither a loud bloody cameo from Al Pacino nor the obviously tacked-on ending come close to redeeming the tedium and the unfulfilled promise of a second scene from Walken doesnt help.

Charles Taylor Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Jennifer Lopez Movies Entertainment News As is often the case with movies that have poisonous advance word of mouth ""Gigli"" turns out to be merely bad -- not a train wreck not the crime against humanity its been rumored to be. That and the fact that its fashionable to hate Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez right now will probably do nothing to discourage the predictable pig pile of critics trying to outdo each other by seeing who can be the most dismissive or scathing. After all nobody wants to look like the class nerd. More often than not buzz is something created by the studio and there are too many -- you should pardon the expression -- entertainment journalists and critics who report that buzz as if its fact. Needless to say critics who believe anything a studio tells them in advance are damn fools. I dont know how many times Ive heard critics say ""It must be bad the studio isnt screening it"" as if marketability were a mark of quality. I suspect that whats made Columbia nervous about the movie isnt that its bad -- studios release far worse movies with no compunction -- but that it isnt a formula picture. There are no car chases or explosions no boffo jokes that can become catchphrases before the movie opens and only one gunshot. The ads showing Affleck and J.Lo in a clinch dont hint that she plays a lesbian. ""Gigli"" is a character-driven piece pitched awkwardly between comedy and drama. Affleck is Gigli a mob enforcer whos far too tenderhearted to bring his assignments the level of brutality desired by his boss (played by Lenny Venito -- to say he gives a one-note performance would be generous). A federal prosecutor is threatening to make trouble so Giglis boss tells him to kidnap the prosecutors teenage autistic brother Brian (Justin Bartha) for leverage. Giglis boss doesnt trust him not to screw up so he sends another contractor named Ricki (Lopez) to keep an eye on things. She flummoxes Gigli. Not only does she show more patience and kindness toward Brians quirks but her quiet way of dealing with things makes hash of Giglis macho bluster. The lead performances work the same way. Affleck bellows his way through dem dese and dose-isms and Lopez who underplays nicely consistently shows him up with her quiet confident line readings. Shes charming here and I loved watching her. The tension between Gigli and Ricki comes from the fact that he cant believe this gorgeous woman is immune to his swaggering. Its fun to watch Lopez disarm Affleck. Her best scene comes when while doing yoga she explains to him that its the vagina and not the penis thats the real power in the world. One thing the writer-director Martin Brest can take pride in is that ""Gigli"" has a sexual openness uncommon in Hollywood movies. Theres no shame no big shock moment when during that speech Lopez refers to ""my pussy."" And when they do go to bed its not presented as if Ricki is ""cured"" of her lesbianism. Sex is sex the movie is saying and the reality of sex is that sometimes we find ourselves falling into bed with the least likely partner. And besides she seduces him. You Might Also Like Theres a startling moment at the beginning of that seduction when Ricki asks Gigli if he thinks his nails need clipping. The movie turns it into a bit about discerning a mans masculinity from how he looks at his nails. But we all know what it means when a woman asks a man shes about to go to bed with if his nails need clipping. Its the sort of small recognizable sexual detail the movies routinely shy away from. (And while the movies treatment of the autistic Brian is often icky it doesnt pretend that he doesnt have sexual feelings either. At times Barthas performance is too much Rainman Jr. At other times hes unpredictably funny.) The problem with ""Gigli"" -- and it isnt a small one -- is that Brest never finds an appropriate tone or pace. He appears to be trying for something like a European sense of melancholy here and instead the movie just feels confused (the black comic moments are jarring though I did laugh at a shot of a fish happily chowing down on a bit of brain matter thats found its way into his tank). Christopher Walken shows up for a few minutes of patented weirdness and so does Al Pacino whose five-minute performance may be the worst acting hes ever done. Predictably the movie falls into sap and it takes forever for Brest to bring things to a conclusion. He gets a few good comic moments. Brian likes to be read to at bedtime and Gigli without a book in his house is reduced to reading the labels of Tabasco sauce and toilet paper to soothe the kid. And theres a funny moment when a gruesome sound inspires Brian to use it as a backbeat to rap Sir Mix-a-Lots ""Baby Got Back."" Considering what Hollywood has put out this summer without any shame the likes of ""Hulk"" and ""Bad Boys II"" ""Gigli"" is a minor failure nothing to celebrate but nothing to be ashamed of. Unless a movie that tries -- however badly -- to concentrate on character instead of spectacle has come to be considered a crime. Charles Taylor is a columnist for the Newark Star-Ledger.
