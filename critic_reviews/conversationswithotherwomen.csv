When a nameless man (Aaron Eckhart) flirts with a woman (Helena Bonham Carter) at a wedding their sparky banter slowly reveals a deeper bond established many years before. The dialogue is sharp entertaining and contemplative musing on gender differences life decisions and the fragility of love.Supposedly supporting these themes is a continuous split screen separating the pair and showing proceedings from varying points of view. Sometimes it flits back in time to show the characters as they once were - or perhaps as they imagine they were.While this contrivance theoretically gives the audience the opportunity to edit what they see it undermines the impact of the conversation and forces a viewing choice thats not always welcome. Perhaps a second watch would be illuminating but this is not the kind of film thats going to attract repeat bookings in their droves. Still excellent performances and a tidy script mean its a cut above your average relationships drama.

Such is the stuff of ""Conversations With Other Women"" a misleadingly titled but intricately structured meditation on the morphology of contemporary relationships starring Aaron Eckhart and Helena Bonham Carter. As the unnamed Man and Woman who meet cute at a wedding reception the two throw off some convincing sparks during what seems to be a spur-of-the-moment flirtation. The plot thickens and during their real-time liaison in the wee hours all is eventually revealed. Writer Gabrielle Zevin has an acerbic peppery tone especially when it comes to Bonham Carters pungent observations on aging and director Hans Canosa uses what could be an irritating split-screen conceit to its full advantage making ""Conversations With Other Women"" a rather ingenious experiment in structure. The film ultimately becomes too contrived to be anything but a fleeting diversion but kudos to these emerging filmmakers for daring to make something a little bit different and for the most part intriguing. And props to the gorgeously haggard Bonham Carter for daring to age so honestly on film. -- Ann Hornaday Conversations With Other Women R 84 minutes Contains profanity and sexual content.

"Conversations is an oddly moving tete-a-tete - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW An oddly moving tete-a-tete By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  September 15 2006 The wedding reception is winding down. The smooth 30 ish bachelor (Aaron Eckhart) perhaps having steeled himself with champagne wanders over to the attractively embittered bridesmaid (Helena Bonham Carter) hovering at a back table. He charms she parries he ripostes. We can guess where this is going. Or can we?The charm of ``Conversations With Other Women"" a gimmicky but oddly moving two-character drama that flies in from who knows where is its intelligentknowingness. The couple at the films center -- we never do learn their names -- is well aware of the pleasures and dangers of the path on which theyre about to embark. They know the rules of engagement and they know when to break them. ``The illusion of effortlessness takes great effort indeed"" sighs the bridesmaid and brother she aint kidding. That brittle weariness extends to both sides of the camera.As the film moves from banquet hall to elevator to hotel room there are certain things we learn about He and She that deepen the tale -- that tilt it toward farce on one hand and small tragedy on the other. The delicate balancing act is embodied in the movies chief formal device The whole darn thing has been shot in split screen.Cued by an observant epigrammatic script by Gabrielle Zevin director-editor Hans Canosa divides the image in half but not for strict he said/she said purposes. Most of the time we see the action (and by ``action"" I mean ``talk"") from separate but closely aligned occasionally overlapping perspectives -- much as two potential lovers might see the world.Just as often though one screen stays with the couple while the other looks in on their significant others or on a possibly shared past that may actually be a fantasy of missed chances. ``Conversations With Other Women"" at times feels like a third leg in Richard Linklaters ``Before Sunrise""/ ``Before Sunset"" relay race but theres the possibility the leg the film is pulling belongs to the audience. Whos the bigger romantic here (and thus the greater fool) -- he or she or us?A movie this precisely constructed risks being merely clever and sure enough the oxygen starts to run out in the final scenes of ``Conversation s ."" What could be a self-conscious acting exercise though is kept in the air by Eckhart and especially Bonham Carter. He lets us see the vanity and fear under the unruffled exterior as well as the naivete  While the characters are the same age she correctly notes ``I feel like youre a little boy and Im an older woman.""As for Bonham Carter Tim Burton movies and new motherhood have kept her from wandering of late into roles like this which is our loss. Always a vivid actress she gets more interesting with each passing year -- more adept at conveying undercurrents of passion knowledge wit dread. Age genuinely becomes Carter unlike most of her bland Hollywood peers and Im beginning to think we havent seen her best work yet.``Conversations With Other Women"" isnt her best work but its a small tart appetizer for what may yet come an amuse - bouche flavored with regret.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

By Moira Macdonald       Seattle Times movie critic PREV of NEXT FABRICATION FILMS          The one-night courtship between two wedding-goers (Helena Bonham Carter and Aaron Eckhart) is effectively portrayed throughout ""Conversations with Other Women"" with a split screen. Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Conversations with Other Women"" with Helena Bonham Carter Aaron Eckhart. Directed by Hans Canosa from a screenplay by Gabrielle Zevin. 84 minutes. Rated R for language and sexual content. Harvard Exit. Described on paper Hans Canosas film probably sounds unbearable. ""Conversations with Other Women"" taking place over the course of one night in Manhattan is the tale of a brief encounter between an unnamed man (Aaron Eckhart) and woman (Helena Bonham Carter) depicted throughout with a split screen. In this case however a picture -- or rather two pictures -- is worth more than any words. Yes the split screen is a gimmick but it works like gangbusters. The two characters -- let us call them He and She -- meet up at a wedding reception at a hotel Shes a reluctant bridesmaid Hes a guest with a wandering eye. Perhaps they have met before but Gabrielle Zevins screenplay dances delicately with this question before answering it later on. They flirt they chat they record sound bites for the wedding video and ultimately they go up to her room where they have sex by the light of the flashing message indicator on the phone. And then they chat some more. In other words its a pretty old story. But the dialogue has a bitter heightened cleverness that feels very real in this kind of situation two intelligent people made self-conscious by their discomfort with each other. ""There are no happy endings in our future"" says She in her husky smokers rasp; they both know this isnt a romantic comedy. Bonham Carter and Eckhart who both have faces that reward lingering close-ups sink deep into their characters able to let silences tell their backstory as well as any dialogue. ""Conversations"" might well have been compelling as a single-camera character study but the split-screen technique takes it into a new realm. Canosa uses the vertical split in a dizzying array of ways to show past and present simultaneously; to show two people apart at the same time; to turn a crowded three-shot (as the two are joined in an elevator by a bitchy fellow bridesmaid) into a claustrophobic six. Sometimes the split is obvious; sometimes it seems to fade away We see two people sitting side by side and the seam is so carefully hidden that they appear to be sitting together when theyre actually far apart. At times He or She will enter the others screen as if boundaries are dissolving and then become isolated in their own screens again. Or the two screens can explore fantasy and reality The two are apart in one screen but kissing (as He wishes they were) in the other. It can be tricky to watch both screens at once (""Conversations With Other Women"" rewards multiple viewings) but its invigorating to see a filmmaker exploring technique as metaphor. ""Time really cant move in two directions"" notes one of the characters. No but this movie can.

Starring Helena Bonham Carter and Aaron Eckhart. Directed by Hans Canosa. (R. 82 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Conversations With Other Women"" is a smart sexy romantic drama directed within an inch of its life by Hans Canosa. Canosa employs a split screen something another director might use for a minute or two as a stylistic flourish but he uses it for the entire movie. He shoots each protagonist with a different camera even though both are together in the same room for almost the entire movie. Theres an invisible line down the middle of the screen and it stays there from the first shot till the last. This effect is distancing often frustrating and sometimes just plain odd. Maybe frustration is the point. Maybe the idea is that the man and the woman though together in the same room inhabit different psychological landscapes. Or maybe not. Maybe the director just liked the effect. Most viewers wont. When two actors stand alongside each other its distracting to see all of one in one frame and then a piece of that same actor showing up in the next frame. My guess is that ""Conversations With Other Women"" would have been better had Canosa taken a more conventional approach -- certainly the story would have had more emotional force. Then again even if filmed by Richard Linklater this story could never have achieved the lilting lyricism of the ""Before"" pictures despite a certain similarity in structure Like ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset"" the film presents us with conversation-as-seduction a two-person conversation between a man and a woman that stretches over an evening. In the waning minutes of a New York wedding reception an oily attractive man (Aaron Eckhart) spots a sharp-witted attractive woman (Helena Bonham Carter) and strikes up a conversation. Shes in the wedding party visiting from London and he lives in New York. Over time they come to realize that they knew each other years before. From the beginning sex is in the atmosphere and soon it begins to seem inevitable. The wedding after all is being held in a hotel which means their getting-acquainted conversation is taking place in a building with hundreds of bedrooms. Though the split-screen gimmick is questionable Canosa brings it off with grace and inventiveness. Sometimes both actors are in one frame while the other shows a scene from the past or a vision of the future. In a couple of instances both frames show the same actor doing alternative takes of the same reaction shot. The best use of the strategy is when the two face each other and one frame shows one actors right profile and the other frame swings around to show the same profile of the other actor. If this all sounds too clever by half its not -- its too clever by whole -- but enjoy it because this is not a trend thats about to catch on. Besides the script by Gabrielle Zevin is clever too and in all the ways that word ""clever"" implies skillful shrewd intelligent and just a trifle icy. Icy or not to think back on ""Conversations With Other Women"" having seen it is to be impressed by the control that the screenwriter has over the material how dialogue thats seemingly free-flowing is carefully calibrated to introduce a series of revelations that keeps viewers on their toes. This is entertainment by and for adults. Its about adults as well dealing with the romantic aspirations of two middle-aged people and their accumulated choices and regrets. Both Bonham Carter and Eckhart are good at giving us their characters practiced surface and the truth thats underneath it. Eckharts smile is about as engaging and thoroughly untrustworthy as that of anyone in the current cinema and our wondering about him is part of the movies suspense. Likewise Bonham Carters prickliness as the woman could be the indication of either strong uncompromising character or mere irritability. -- Advisory Strong language nudity convincingly realistic simulated sex.

With Justin Long Adam Herschman. (90 min.)Eight colleges have rejected Bartleby Gaines (Long) and his parents are on his case. Several friends are in the same predicament. Their solution Set up a fake college Internet site and send themselves acceptance letters then rent an abandoned mental hospital as a campus. Troubles begin when hundreds of other would-be students find the website and show up waving tuition checks. And then come legal challenges from the elite college up the hill. ""Sophomoric"" doesnt begin to describe the humor (most of the characters are freshmen after all) but you may find some laughs in spite of yourself. Grade C- M.K. TerrellSex/Nudity 12 instances of innuendo 2 images of a phallic sculpture. Violence 2 instances. Profanity 111 expressions including 62 harsh. Drugs/Alcohol/Tobacco 8 scenes of drinking 1 drug deal. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Conversations With Other Women (R)Director Hans Canosa. With Aaron Eckhart Helena Bonham Carter. (84 min.) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Eckhart and Carter play old lovers who meet up at a wedding reception after many years. Shes married hes involved but for a night at least they attempt to put the rest of their lives on hold. Gabrielle Zevins screenplay is second-tier Pinter. The actors who portray a reunion that is more sparring match than love fest strike occasional sparks. (But why must Carter always look so chalk white?) The story is shown in split-screen an effect that has no rationale except artiness. Grade B-- Peter RainerThe House of Sand (R)Director Andrucha Waddington. With Fernanda Montenegro Fernanda Torres.(103 min.)Resembling at times the Japanese metaphysical drama ""Woman in the Dunes"" Waddingtons film takes in three generations of mothers and daughters enduring life in the remote northern Brazilian landscape of Maranhao between 1910 and 1969. Mother and daughter are played in successive stages by Montenegro and her real-life daughter Torres. The visuals are often abstractly beautiful - you havent seen this much sand since ""Lawrence of Arabia."" Montenegro the star of ""Central Station"" and her daughter make a remarkable pair. They hold your attention even when the emptily portentous story does not. Grade B+- P.R.Step Up (PG-13)Director Anne Fletcher. With Channing Tatum Jenna Dewan. (98 min.)Vandalizing a Baltimore arts school gets troublemaker Tyler Gage (Tatum) 200 hours of community service mopping floors at that very school. Tylers street-dancing talent wins him a reprieve when a student (Dewan) needs a partner to rehearse for her senior dance recital. Choreographer Fletchers directorial debut may be a bit clunky and how many teen flicks like this have we seen? But its themes of commitment and redemption around go down easily. Plus the dance numbers are worth waiting for. Grade C+- M.K.T.

Helena Bonham Carter and Aaron Eckhart could lift this from the fest circuit to very limited theatrical runs. The battle of the sexes is restaged to clever but inconsequential effect in ""Conversations With Other Women."" Very much a case of old wine in a new bottle this two-hander about a couple sparring and trysting over the course of a night is played out entirely in split-screen -- or as first-time director Hans Canosa calls it ""dual-frame"" -- with sometimes catchy but more often innocuous results. Names of Helena Bonham Carter and Aaron Eckhart could lift this from the fest circuit to very limited theatrical runs. An unnamed man and woman in their late 30s meet at the New York hotel ballroom wedding of the mans sister. As she (Bonham Carter) chain-smokes and he (Eckhart) chain-drinks innuendos and witticisms roll out of their mouths and they circle one another like cats; they both appear pretty good at their games -- she at simultaneously warding off and attracting male attention with British-accented zingers he at coming at a woman from so many different angles that his relentlessness is finally irresistible. First-time helmer Canosa divides the Panavision widescreen frame right down the middle with one character on each side. But as the actors and camera move around boundaries are ignored and thesps often cross the middle line to the other side or turn up in alternate angles of the same scene. Format is further used to provide flashes of what the characters are talking about particularly a past that shortly clarifies itself as one the two characters shared as student lovers two decades earlier. Revelation henceforth gives their interchanges a new layer of import as the evening pushes toward the time for them to decide whether or not theyre going to bed down; shes got a husband and kids in London and hes got a hot young girlfriend. Initial stretch has a frisky fast-on-its-feet quality that engages and Bonham Carters self-deprecating and dismissive way with one-liners amuses in a Bette Davis-lite sort of way. In the final half-hour however Gabrielle Zevins verbally agile script gets too heavy and serious depleting pics modest tank of gas very quickly. Nor does it take much advantage of the big opportunity it sets up to explore the differences in sexuality at different ages what sex means at 19 compared to 38; how desire lust sensuality and love between the same people contrasts over such a long gap. Among the more interesting character insights are the womans observation to the man that ""Somehow I feel so much older than you"" and the general sense that the man is still immature and on-the-make qualities deftly conveyed in Eckharts perf while the woman is cynically over-mature and hung up on her age. Director-editor Canosa and lenser Steve Yedlin keep everything moving fluidly although its debatable how much the elaborately worked split-screen technique actually adds when all is said and done.
