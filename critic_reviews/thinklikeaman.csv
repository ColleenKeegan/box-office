The men realise soon theyre being manipulated so they play the ladies at their own game - which naturally blows up in their faces.  Theres no mistaking the films true star Harveys real-life 2009 dating-advice tome. Its funny how the camera lingers over its cover. But for what amounts to a feature-length ad this is surprisingly entertaining. Amid all the candlelit dinners and happy endings you almost miss the fact that Harvey offers a depressingly businesslike view of love. Its fitting since at heart this movie is all about transactions both romantic and commercial.

Men as you may have heard are either cads mamas boys or slackers while women are blameless tormented creatures who are doomed to put up with (and try to improve) men. If that sounds familiar you must have watched a sitcom at some point in the last 30 years. Inspired by comedian Steve Harveys relationship-advice book Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man and turned into an overlong screenplay by Friends with Benefits duo Keith Merryman and David A. Newman the film is based on the principle that men will never do what women want them to do -- which is by definition what they should do -- unless women trick them into doing it. The women in the movie who all live in Los Angeles and have jobs that do not permit them to have money problems treat Harveys book like a bible. No matter what kind of gal you are or what kind of fella youre dealing with the current host of Family Feud has a list of tips for you Dominic (Michael Ealy) is a dreamer who flits from job to job with no long-term goals; his new lady friend Lauren (Taraji P. Henson) is a successful business executive with high standards who must motivate him. Michael (Terrence Jenkins) is too attached to his mother (Jenifer Lewis) to make a girlfriend a priority; it befalls his latest Candace (Regina Hall) a single mom herself to show him how. Jeremy (Jerry Ferrara) has been with Kristen (Gabrielle Union) for several years and shows no sign of popping the question; Kristen obviously must take matters into her own hands. Zeke (Romany Malco) a smooth ladies man and total player meets Mya (Meagan Good) who has decided shes not going to have sex with him until theyve known each other for 90 days. These four guys have two other friends as well a newly divorced one (Kevin Hart) and a happily married one (Gary Owen.) The former character is included purely for comic relief enjoying his new liberation by spending too much time at strip clubs. The latter is here to remind everyone of the ideal relationship theyre all hoping for. Ill try not to read too much into the fact that the guy is hardly in the movie and we never see his wife. The four main couples ups and downs provide some modest laughs for a while. Directed by Tim Story (Barbershop the Fantastic Four movies) the film might best be viewed as a glossy showcase for several likable performers who dont often get leading roles. (Im pleased to note that while all but one of the major characters is African American race is mentioned only in passing and jokingly at that. This isnt a Tyler Perry movie. In fact the script takes a couple of well-observed swipes at Perrys formula.) Facile and shallow though it may be its breezily inoffensive. But its also drastically overlong burdened by too many stories about too many couples who are too one-dimensional to be relatable. Even when the womens suggestions are good ones -- Jeremy really should stop being complacent about his career; Michael really is too focused on his mother -- the men would rather lie to their girlfriends about improving themselves than actually improve themselves. Why? Because men are liars duh. Meanwhile the most serious flaw that any female character has is that shes too good at her job. And the overarching plot doesnt make any sense. The women think the Steve Harvey book is a secret even though its a bestseller and are angry when they find out the men have been reading it too. Why? Well because it got to be that point in the movie where the women were supposed to get angry and the men were supposed to feel bad and apologize. You know the routine. Youve seen sitcoms.

In theaters on April 20 2012. Photo Credit Screen Gems/ advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A best-selling self-help book becomes a secret weapon in the war between the sexes. BOTTOM LINE Supririsingly engaging and often very funny with a likable ensemble cast that overcomes the inevitable cliches. CAST Taraji P. Henson Michael Ealy Gabrielle Union Jerry Ferrara. LENGTH 200 While watching the movie version of Steve Harveys self-help book ""Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man"" you may feel a subliminal desire to rush out and buy the book. Not because of its insights into gender -- Did you know men like sex? -- but because the actors keep holding the 23.99 hardcover edition up to your face. Talk about product placement Frame for frame Im not sure Hasbros Transformers have appeared on-screen this often. ""Think Like a Man"" is part of an ongoing trend of movies based on advice books including ""Hes Just Not That Into You"" and the upcoming ""What to Expect When Youre Expecting"" although this one is built around Harveys twinkly eyed personality as a comedian and radio host. That makes the self-promotion understandable but what makes it forgivable is that ""Think Like a Man"" is a surprisingly engaging entertaining and very funny movie. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? It follows several couples facing typical relationship hurdles (hey I didnt say it was original). The women are losing their battles until they find this book by you-know-who that reveals the secrets of the male mind. Example ""Men respect women with standards. Just get some."" As a result Kristen (Gabrielle Union) stops waiting for a proposal from Jeremy (Jerry Ferrara); single mother Candace (Regina Hall) loses patience with mamas boy Michael (Terrence J); successful Lauren (Taraji P. Henson) falls for wage slave Dominic (Michael Ealy); and promiscuous Mya (Meagan Good) withholds her ""cookie"" -- Harveys term -- from lady-killer Zeke (Romany Malco). The squirrelly Kevin Hart as newly divorced Cedric counteracts the syrupy stuff with salty comedy. Director Tim Story (""Barbershop"") juggles this potentially clunky material quite deftly and the bumps are smoothed over by the appealing cast. (Even Chris Brown in a cameo seems likable again.) And despite the hard sell theres absolutely no obligation to buy Harveys book. BooksBooks turned into movies PLOT A best-selling self-help book becomes a secret weapon in the war between the sexes.

BOTTOM LINE Supririsingly engaging and often very funny with a likable ensemble cast that overcomes the inevitable cliches. Books31 must-read celebrity biographies Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff Steve Harvey chats up his book If author comedian and syndicated radio and television host Steve Harvey whos been married three times seems an unlikely relationship expert its because hes not. ""I wrote a book on how men think"" to help empower women Harvey said during an interview last week. Because how men think is Harveys area of expertise. Men share universal truths Harvey says and he wanted to get the ladies to stop talking to other women about men and start talking to men. Or at least to him. So he broke down his talking points into chapters of his book which are played out on-screen. The movies central conceit is that women whove been underserved in relationships buy the book -- which gets loving close-ups -- and confound their men. The men find the book and turn the tables. advertisement | advertise on newsday ""When you take away all the social networking texting Facebook at the end of the day youve got to sit down face to face with this woman and try to make a go of it"" Harvey 55 says. ""What the movie did was it really showed women a lot of the power they possess. At the end of the day every man knows this You gotta have one of them to complete the journey.

Photo SCREEN GEMS Weve all been told that throwing yourself at someone will only make you less desirable. So it goes with this vaguely movie-like infomercial for Steve Harveys best-selling love-advice book of the same title. The more this alleged romantic comedy begs you to adore it the more you wish you could block its calls. Certainly seeing the movie obliterates any need to read Harveys folksy 100 percent retro ""Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man"" since the concepts are underlined constantly. And I do mean underlined via at least a dozen shots of highlighter markers running over bullet points like ""boys shack MEN build homes."" ""Think Like a Man"" looks at the love lives of a group of mostly African-Americans in Los Angeles -- breaking them into a series of matchups Theres the Mamas Boy (Terrence J) versus the Single Mom (Regina Hall); the Dreamer (Michael Ealy) versus the Woman Who Is Her Own Man (Taraji P. Henson); and the Non-Committer (Jerry Ferrara) versus the Ring Girl (Gabrielle Union). The film also pits the Player (Romany Malco) versus the 90-Day Girl (Meagan Good) -- 90 days is how long shes supposed to ""keep the cookie in the cookie jar."" That last gem says it all about this movies coy substitutes for love lust or wit. Between dates the women drink wine and tell each other that having their very own hardcover Harvey tome has given them a new attitude. The men play basketball and dissect their romances with a fervor that would strike the ""Sex and the City"" ladies as somewhat excessive. There are too many couples. And theres no suspense since were hardly going to get a screenplay that suggests Harveys bromides dont actually work. The sole visual interest comes not from director Tim Story (""Barbershop"") but from the actors. Most are devastatingly attractive and talented though the ersatz Jerry Lewis voice and tics of Kevin Hart (as the Happily Divorced Guy) are an acquired taste. Advice books presume that human behavior can be broken into a small number of highly predictable patterns. Movies thrive on individuality and at least the illusion that we can surprise each other from time to time. Shove people into categories then into a film like ""Think Like a Man"" and its a recipe for tedium.

Smoove Director Tim Story Running time 202 Release Opened Apr 20 2012  Editorial Review A womans guide to winning datesBy Ann HornadayFriday Apr. 20 2012Its become an all-too-familiar lament among film fans that the romantic comedy has gone the way of the dodo but those pessimists often overlook some terrific African American rom-coms that have come out in recent years Anyone remember ""Love Jones""? ""Love and Basketball""? ""Something New""? ""Think Like a Man"" a gleaming sumptuous adaptation of Steve Harveys 2009 bestseller ""Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man"" deserves inclusion in that group if only because it seeks to rescue contemporary black storytelling from the clutches of men in drag and misogynist moralizing. An all-star revue of some of the most physically stunning actors working in Hollywood ""Think Like a Man"" is a pleasure if only on a purely sensory level. (The earrings constitute a lustrous ensemble cast all their own.) If it begins to strain under the sheer weight of its multiple characters plot lines and pieces of aphoristic advice ""Think Like a Man"" is a movie sure to find an appreciative audience in anyone longing to see at least some recognizable reality folded into their cinematic fantasy. The nine main characters in ""Think Like a Man"" might be archetypes-bordering-on-stereotypes but all manage to resemble authentic human beings thanks to the terrific actors who play them Lauren (Taraji P. Henson) is a super-successful corporate executive who doesnt want a man whos taller or earns less money than she does; Mya (Meagan Good) she of the bangin earring wardrobe persists in believing that a one-night stand can lead to something real; Candace (Regina Hall) is a single mom. And Kristen (Gabrielle Union) has been living with her college boyfriend for several years without the relationship - or his predilection for ""Star Wars"" and SpongeBob posters - growing up. Each of these gorgeous high-achieving self-aware women faces a unique dating problem for which Harvey - whose cameo appearances on various TV screens gives ""Think Like a Man"" a regrettable air of self-promotion - has just the right advice. The men in their lives - played by Michael Ealy Romany Malco Terrence J and ""Entourages"" Jerry Ferrara respectively - embody Harveys ready-made labels The Dreamer the Player the Mamas Boy and the Non-Committer. (Most of the comic relief in ""Think Like a Man"" arrives by way of Kevin Hart whose motor-mouth shtick begins to wear thin early in the film but who anchors one of the movies funniest set pieces on a basketball court.) Harveys advice - with its 90-day rules before having sex and warnings against being a ""chirp-chirp"" girl - doesnt break any ground that readers of books like ""The Rules"" wont know by heart. (The ""chirp-chirp"" line has to do with insisting that your date open the car door for you. Now you know.) But you dont have to buy into Harveys portrayal of sexual gamesmanship and manipulation to take in the myriad pleasures of ""Think Like a Man"" in which director Tim Story makes the most of his attractive and accomplished cast and with glancing references to books like ""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"" and rapper AMG manages to sound a clear distinctively hip pop-cultural dog whistle. (And an occasionally unwelcome one especially when it traffics in tired unfunny gay jokes.) Its on this level - which co-star Ealy recently described as ""that beautiful black aesthetic"" - that ""Think Like a Man"" is best appreciated. Forget hackneyed cliches about Players and Dreamers and the scheming women who seek to domesticate them. Focus on the pleasures of watching a group of gifted actors spar and seduce each other with genuine warmth and ""Think Like a Man"" just might go straight to your head.Contains sexual content some crude humor and brief drug use.

"Think Like a Man suffers from self-promotion |       NJ.com comments Think Like a Man suffers from self-promotion Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on April 20 2012 at 830 AM View/Post Comments Alan Markfield Lauren (Taraji P. Henson) with Dominic (Michael Ealy) in ""Think Like a Man."" ""Think Like a Man"" is an occasionally funny 90-minute romantic comedy. Unfortunately its interrupted by about 30 minutes worth of Steve Harvey commercials. Harvey wrote the self-help book ""Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man"" which purported to tell women what men really thought -- and how to outsmart them. Like the similarly Im-just-being-honest put-down ""Hes Just Not That Into You"" it became such a best-seller Hollywood was willing to buy it just for the title. Except once the movie starts it feels like an ad for the book. We see Harvey on TV talking about it. We get Harvey on-screen talking right to us. We get endless close-ups of the dust jacket of various pages of actual highlighted sentences. We get everything but a way to drop it in our Amazon shopping cart. Its not only shameless it detracts from what this movie could have been and still is when the self-promoting Harvey shuts up -- which is an old-fashioned battle-of-the-sexes comedy focusing on four fictional supposedly modern couples. The gimmick is that first the women read Harveys book and decide to use its manipulative strategies to catch the guys. Then the men read it and decide to turn the tables to trick the women into bed. Yes this is all about as liberated as a Tony Curtis sex comedy. Its also overcomplicated with at least two too many characters. Yet in a way the overabundance of roles is a good thing because it means a lot of work for underused African-American actors. The always terrific Taraji P. Henson for example is marvelous as the MBA whos set her sights so high she doesnt realize what a diamond in the rough Michael Ealy is (although a woman at the screening -- who breathed ""Lord have mercy"" when a bare-chested Ealy appeared -- had no such problem). Meagan Good is lovely too as the too-easy woman who has decided to start off all boyfriends with a 90-day probation period before they get their ""benefits package."" And the manic Kevin Hart steals every scene hes in as a filthy-mouthed hanger-on who trash-talks everybody. Sadly little of the rest of the movie has his raw humor. In fact the themes of emotional deception and sexual withholding -- the women talk a lot about keeping their ""cookie"" in the cookie jar until the boys earn it -- are pretty dusty if not outright distasteful. In a particularly ugly development the film -- like some of the Tyler Perry ones it references -- saves its sharpest barbs for the most successful female character who were told cant ""get"" a man because shes become one. Its the sort of message that plays well only to the scared or envious. But that doesnt keep Henson from giving this character warmth. Or Hart -- a fireplug who puts his body into everything -- from finding dirty laughs in the weakest of lines. Or Ealy -- a rougher version of Terrence Howard -- from setting hearts aflutter with his cool pale eyes. But just when they get something going Harvey shows up again flashing an unctuous smile and pushing his book. Yes this movie urges women to ""Think Like a Man."" But it thinks like an infomercial -- and for a pretty old-fashioned product. Ratings note The film contains strong language sexual references and drug use. Think Like a Man (PG-13) Screen Gems (123 min.) Directed by Tim Story. With Meagan Good Taraji P. Henson Kevin Hart Michael Ealy. Now playing in New Jersey.

Henson are shown in a scene from ""Think Like a Man."" (AP Photo/Sony Pictures-Screen Gems Alan Markfield) One sure takeaway from the urban rom-com ""Think Like a Man"" If you werent aware comedian Steve Harvey has a best-selling book ""Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man"" you will be.The book is shoved down viewers throats with shots of characters reading it discussing it fighting over it -- even scenes of Harvey quoting from it.""Think Like a Man"" also proves that romantic stories from African-American perspectives still exist outside of Tyler Perry films. (Theres a fun nod to Perry when Michael Ealy references a character he played in Perrys ""For Colored Girls."") In the movie directed by Tim Story couples meet hook up and break up. The men are lumped into types at the onset Theres the Player Zeke (Romany Malco); the Mamas Boy Michael (Terrence Jenkins); the Dreamer Dominic (Ealy); the Noncommittal Jeremy (Jerry Ferrara); the Happily Divorced Guy Cedric (Kevin Hart in a breakout comic performance); and the Happily Married Guy Bennett (Gary Owen).The young Michael meets older Kandace (Regina Hall) who draws disapproval from Michaels mother Loretta (Kinloch native Jenifer Lewis). Recently fired cook Dominic woos executive Lauren (Taraji P. Henson) but fears telling her who he really is. Zeke meets Mya (Meagan Good) who is holding out sexually as part of her ""90-day rule."" Jeremy doesnt see the obvious -- that his live-in Kristen (Gabrielle Union) is waiting on a ring.And so it goes with the women navigating their entanglements based on what they read in Harveys book. The men discover the book and use Harveys words to give the women what they want so the men in turn can get what they want. Despite the crass book promotion the overlong film is harmless romantic fun thats well played.Among many are cameos by Kelly Rowland Sherri Shepherd Keri Hilson Ron Artest Bruce Bruce La La Anthony and more notably Wendy Williams as a surprise character and Chris Brown as a one-night stand gone wrong for Mya.

Not just how to dress act and turn ""no"" into ""go"" but how not to become a chirp-chirp girl. A what you ask? Well as comedian and broadcast personality Steve Harvey explains in Think Like a Man -- a film that illustrates the stereotypes and situations he wrote about in his self-help best-seller Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man -- shes the girl who puts up with a man who uses his key fob to unlock the car -- ""chirp chirp"" -- as hes heading for the drivers side and expects her to open the passenger-side door herself. Meagan Good playing a sweet sensitive woman whos protecting herself by adopting Harveys 90-day rule before succumbing to her boyfriends advances wont put up with chirp-chirping or with any other guff from smooth-talking player Romany Malco. And so it goes in this romantic rondelay. Commitment-phobe (Jerry Ferrara) dates girl-who-wants-a-ring (Gabrielle Union); mamas boy (Terrence J) falls for strong single mom (Regina Hall); independent career gal (Taraji P. Henson) meets head-in-clouds dreamer (Michael Ealy) who waits tables to make ends meet as he seeks kitchen cred as a chef; and divorced guy (Kevin Hart) misses feminine companionship so much that hes prepared to hit on a friends mom (Jenifer Lewis). As the types pile up it will occur to you that its kind of amazing that humanity manages to procreate at all. The story pits men who get together to drink play basketball and fantasize about women against women who gather at book clubs to complain about men. As the film begins Harveys guidebook is giving what used to be called ""the weaker sex"" an advantage. But then the men find the book and ... well you can see where this is going. When the men -- Jeremy (Jerry Ferrara) Bennett (Gary Owen) Michael (Terrence J) Dominic (Michael Ealy) and Zeke -- discover the women are using dating tactics from Steve Harveys book they decide to turn the tables on their significant others. Alan Markfield/Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Alan Markfield/Sony Pictures Tim Story who also directed the ensemble comedy Barbershop here takes time-honored stand-up material and turns it into something pleasantly sitcom-ish -- kind of a knowing urbane variation on the sort of thing that would get more earnest treatment from Tyler Perry. The director doesnt require -- and doesnt really get -- distinctive acting from his cast but every once in a while the company manages to wink broadly at the films genre. If you caught actor Michael Ealy in Perrys movie version of For Colored Girls for instance youll get a kick out of the way his character here mocks his character there. Thats pretty meta for a movie based on a self-help book -- a form that qualifies as a whole mini-genre in romantic comedy these days what with Drew Barrymores Hes Just Not That Into You Tina Feys Mean Girls the upcoming What to Expect When Youre Expecting. (The phenomenon goes all the way back to the 1960s and Helen Gurley Browns Sex and the Single Girl which the New York Times bemusedly conceded was ""not the worst picture ever made""). Also Woody Allens loose funny take on David Reubens sex manual Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex  But Were Afraid to Ask. As with most of those pictures theres a promotional impulse driving Think Like a Man. Its a little more blatant here with everyone holding up Steve Harveys book for the camera at one point or another -- including Steve Harvey. All that winking makes it sort of a two-hour infomercial but a decently amusing one.

JENNIE PUNTER The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 20 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 223PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Think Like a Man is a romantic ensemble comedy -- an excessively populated and chatty two-hour one -- spun from comedian and syndicated radio host Steve Harveys 2009 self-help relationship bestseller Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man. The book is sort of a first-person spin on Men Are from Mars Women Are from Venus which was published 20 years ago this month and remains a popular guide for improved interplanetary communication. Screen grab from the online trailer for the new comedy ""Think Like a Man"" starring Michael Ealy Jerry Ferrara and Meagan Good Movies Think Like a Man The official trailer The flick feels less like a self-help guide than it does an extended infomercial; in addition to frequent product placement there are ""reading"" scenes (pink highlighters are a girls best friend when shes trying to land a man) and occasional excerpt recitations from the author himself directly addressing the camera but pictured on a flat-screen monitor with no external context. The fact that the movie adaptation uses just the latter half of Harveys book title is your first clue to its slant. It centres around a fraternity of six friends -- each designated in the intro as a particular ""type"" (as per Harveys book) -- who regularly meet to play basketball drink and talk about women. Four of them discover that the women they are involved with (who are also ""types"") are applying Harveys wisdom to the relationship dynamic so the men study up and turn the game to the home-team advantage for what amounts to a temporary fix. While using the book as a plot catalyst is certainly not a bad approach to constructing a fictional story from the material the movie is bogged down from the get-go with too many bits of business and a very lengthy setup. The many characters are introduced more than once and the story has to show us the initiation of three relationships before the women even start reading the book. Considering what passes for romantic comedy these days any one of the four intertwined and equally weighted stories could easily have been the focus of a movie. Kudos to director Tim Story - who wrangled the boys in Barbershop and the spandex set in two Fantastic Four movies - for not allowing the strained construction to become too convoluted and for keeping the movie moving at a brisk pace despite its overlong running time. Each relationship has its game scenario the solid cast valiantly making the best of thin roles. ""The player"" Zeke (Romany Malco) whose successful modus operandus is counterintuitive pick-up lines that lead to casual hook-ups meets his match in Mya (Meagan Good) who applies Harveys 90-day rule. ""Mamas boy"" Michael (Terrence J) becomes smitten with single mom Candace (Regina Hall) but cant decide who is the top lady in his life. Jeremy (Jerry Ferrera) has been living nine years with college girlfriend Kristen (Gabrielle Union) who signals her need for commitment by packing up his geek fan-boy paraphernalia and redecorating the apartment. The romantic pair with the most performance heat is ""dreamer"" Dominic (Michael Ealy) an aspiring chef who parks cars for a living and Lauren (Taraji P. Henson) a business executive with impossibly high standards for a life companion. The talented Henson whose gutsy but fragile character in TVs Person of Interest is the reason I tune in every week manages to rise above her hackneyed character. Chewing the scenery at every opportunity is comedian Kevin Hart delivering an over-the-top stream-of-consciousness performance as the about-to-be-divorced Cedric who eventually has a change of heart. He also provides the voice-over narration -- as if the non-stop dialogue wasnt enough. But its comedian Gary Owen as the married Bennett who provides the movies ""blink and youll miss it"" turning point When the guys razz him for being hen-pecked (he has to go home and cook dinner) he gives a knowing smile and explains that he likes being at home with his family. In Think Like a Man exploring whats between the covers isnt nearly as much fun as it sounds. Think Like a Man Directed by Tim Story Written by Keith Merryman and David A.

Photo Alan Markfield Screen Gems Think Like a Man review Bright romantic comedy 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Think Like a Man Romantic comedy. Starring Meagan Good Gabrielle Union Taraji P. Henson and Regina Hall. Directed by Tim Story. (PG-13. 122 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Think Like a Man"" is a romantic comedy about four women who decide to manipulate their men by using the relationship advice found in a self-help book. The book - a real-life best-seller Steve Harveys ""Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man"" - gives women practical instruction on how to tell if hes serious when to have sex and how to make him pop the question. Take those situations and fictionalize them a little and you can see how this could be the basis for a good-enough by-the-books comedy. But ""Think Like a Man"" is better than that. Though it is funny - at times laugh-out-loud funny - this comedy is by and for adults. Three of the four women are played by actresses either around or just past 40 and consequently the stakes behind their relationships are higher than what you usually get in romantic comedies. Kristen (Gabrielle Union) lives with a guy who shows no interest in getting married. Candace (Regina Hall) is a single mother. Lauren (Taraji P. Henson) is so successful she cant find a man who isnt scared off by her money and position. And Mya (Meagan Good) cant seem to get a second date - though if youve ever seen Meagan Good that is very very hard to believe. The movie provides the rare and satisfying spectacle of four gorgeous intelligent women actually playing four gorgeous intelligent women - not the victims of a psycho or the girlfriends of a detective or prostitutes bemoaning the hard life of a pimp. That these are four gorgeous intelligent black actresses who rarely find roles in feature films worthy of their talent wit or power makes ""Think Like a Man"" even more something to appreciate. Oh yeah there are men in this movie too and theyre not bad either. They fill out the male types of Mamas boy (Terrence Jenkins) dreamer (Michael Ealy) Player (Romany Malco) and perpetual adolescent (Jerry Ferrara). Thrown into the mix - and a major source of the movies propulsion - is comedian Kevin Hart as a newly divorced man who insists that hes having the time of his life. Hart gives a lift to what might otherwise be static conversation scenes playing every moment with an edge of franticness and hysteria. Most of the big laughs in ""Think Like a Man"" come from him. Men and women play games and deceive each other on the way to falling in love - thats a familiar movie pattern and some of the misunderstandings here are predictable. In one case people dont explain when they would and should in real life and in any honest screenplay. But for the most part the movie avoids cliches or at least subverts them. The men and women take turns being wrong and love doesnt always play out according to formula. There are lessons for everybody which is what love stories are ultimately about - love as the great educator. ""Think Like a Man"" runs 122 minutes long for a romantic comedy. It doesnt feel long not at all. The script by Keith Merryman and David A. Newman is packed with tricky situations and funny incidents and if anything its a triumph of economy. It covers four relationships with enough detail to do justice to all of them without ever giving the sense of a movie going sideways to account for everybody. At every moment the motion is forward with the audience wondering what will happen next. Director Tim Story finds a tone that supports the big laughs and the tender moments. He does his job keeping the audience laughing - and caring - from start to finish.

Henson and Michael Ealy in a film on patterns of romance. Credit Ron Batzdorff/Screen Gems Tim Storys rom-com film isnt just based on Steve Harveys book ""Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man"" its also a two-hour advertisement for it. In ""Think Like a Man"" the camera lovingly and frequently frames copies of the book. Mr. Harvey appears in the movie dispensing advice. And when the characters talk about relationships they often begin like this ""Steve says. ...""So what does Steve say? Mostly things youve heard before Men need to be the providers (its in their DNA); men dont like the words ""we need to talk"" etc. A running joke is that Mr. Harvey has thrown men under the bus by giving away their secrets. But gents if they were secrets they wouldnt be cliches.Mr. Harvey doesnt really want women to think like men but to know how men think. That way women can get what they want respect steady relationships rings. They can also help men learn to want those things too.The couples in ""Think Like a Man"" written by Keith Merryman and David A. Newman play out variations on the relationship war. The characters are introduced as types -- the Mamas Boy the Woman Who Acts Like a Man -- and the appealing cast (including Taraji P. Henson Gabrielle Union Michael Ealy and Romany Malco) doesnt make much more of them. This is humor by pattern recognition.""Think Like a Man"" is occasionally funny though its dirty riffs -- most provided by Kevin Hart as the Happily Divorced Guy -- are as formulaic as its earnest parts. The movie isnt liable to surprise you. Nor will it bore or offend you even if you find Mr. Harveys shtick more old-school sexist than old-school courtly. Its not in my DNA to say more.""Think Like a Man"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some sex some talking dirty. Think Like A Man Director Tim Story Writers Keith Merryman David A.

Henson star as one of the couples trying to get the upper hand in their relationship via Steve Harveys dating tome in Think Like a Man.Sponsored LinksBased on Steve Harveys humorous man-baiting book Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man the film not only plunks men and women on different pages but essentially has them consulting conflicting instruction manuals.Intended to empower women the 2009 book -- which is referred to so often it feels like product placement -- seeks to enlighten them about how mens minds work.VIDEO Michael Early thinks like a manSTORY Think Like a Man cast dishes love adviceMORE 5 Questions with Steve HarveyIn a scene that feels forced and oddly dated women line up to get their copies with unbridled excitement. Montages feature droves of women who are madly eager to learn the secrets of how men think. They are told that to find love they need to delay sex. No matter that it makes romance seem like a business transaction. The point is clear Follow these steps and youll get the best return on your investment.While the outcomes of the individual romances portrayed are fairly predictable the chemistry among the cast members makes this more entertaining than most ensemble rom-coms.

Henson Michael Ealy Gabrielle Union Jerry Ferrara Romany Malco Meagan Good Steve Harvey Director Tim StoryDistributor Sony Screen Gems Rating PG-13 for sexual content some crude humor and brief drug use Running time 2 hours 2 minutes Opens Friday nationwideTheres Lauren (Taraji P. Henson) the high-powered businesswoman intent on landing someone equally successful. She meets a handsome guy driving a Porsche and takes him for the man of her dreams. He turns out to be sensitive but broke Dominic (Michael Ealy) a struggling chef with big dreams and a day job as a valet.Mya (Meagan Good) is intent on making suave player Zeke (Romany Malco) wait the Harvey-recommended three months before consummating their relationship.Kristen (Gabrielle Union) seeks maturity and commitment for her overgrown adolescent of a longtime boyfriend Jeremy (Jerry Ferrara). She has put up with his fanboy ways for years and after reading Harvey she embarks on whipping Jeremy into a grown man.Single mother Candace (Regina Hall) is thrilled to have met Michael (Terrence Jenkins) a wonderful guy who bonds with her young son. But shes no fan of his slavish devotion to his mother.When the guys all buddies figure out that theyre being manipulated they turn to Harveys book to outsmart their women. Of course the table-turning and double-crossing doesnt stop there.The execution is not always clever particularly as the stories tie up all too neatly. Gender politics however is presented with breezy humor and the cast is amiable across the board. Director Tim Story draws on the talent he displayed in witty ensemble comedies such as 2002s Barbershop.Even though Think Like a Man espouses something akin to the philosophy in Beyonces Single Ladies(Put a Ring on It) it makes manipulation more fun than it ought to be.

By the end of the new movie ""Think Like a Man"" you will have no doubt in your mind that Steve Harvey has written a book entitled ""Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man."" Mainly because the characters in the movie keep talking about Steve Harvey and his book ""Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man."" And even Steve Harvey pops up periodically to discuss his book ""Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man."" If you dont mind enduring the films infomercial aspects ""Think Like a Man"" winds up being an entertaining romantic comedy covering the very familiar ground of the differences between men and women and the strategies that women must employ to get men to put that ring on their finger. Once Harvey himself disappears about halfway through the movie has an easier time finding its own voice. Comedian Kevin Hart plays a man in the throes of a divorce and he narrates the romantic misadventures of his closest friends. ""Think Like a Man"" reveals its willingness to treat its characters as archetypes early on -- Harts character introduces us to ""The Dreamer"" ""The Mommas Boy"" et. al. which makes it easy never to learn the names of any of the people onscreen. (Well except for Meagan Goods Mya but only because of a running gag in which a former one-night-stand keeps running into her and calling her ""Michelle"" and a bunch of other incorrect names that being with ""M."") Realtor Kristen (Gabrielle Union) has lived with man-child Jeremy (Jerry Ferrara) since college but cant get him to propose. Single mom Candace (Regina Hall) falls for Michael (Terrence J) but he hasnt quite cut the umbilical cord to his own overbearing mother (Jenifer Lewis). High-powered businesswoman Lauren (Taraji P. Henson) wants a man who wont be intimidated by her swimming-with-the-sharks lifestyle so would-be chef Dominic (Michael Ealy) has to pretend to be as rich and powerful as she is even though hes broke and between gigs. And Mya wants a man who will stick around so she forces notorious player Zeke (Romany Malco) to wait 90 dates before he gets what she (and all of the films other women) refer to as ""the cookie."" All of these women turn to you guessed it Steve Harveys ""Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man"" for advice which works up to the point when the men figure out what theyre up to and start reading the book themselves. Will the women figure out that the men are creating fake versions of themselves to please their ladies? Or will the men discover that they actually want to live up to their Harvey-inspired phony personae? Like the recent ""Hes Just Not That Into You"" -- another adaptation of a non-fiction dating guide albeit one where the authors were happy to remain off-screen -- this is a movie thats always about what its about. Theres not a single conversation that isnt about the mechanics of dating or some other issue of conflict between the genders but this cast is so uniformly engaging and charismatic that they make the whole thing work. Even saddled with an adaptation thats constantly calling attention to the source material screenwriters Keith Merryman and David A. Newman (who previously collaborated on ""Friends with Benefits"") keep the dialogue sprightly and the relationships interesting. Its not uncommon for movies to cram one white girl or one black guy into a group of friends for diversitys sake but this is one of a very few movies where a mixed-race collection of pals feels totally organic. Director Tim Story made a wise choice in returning to comedy (""Barbershop"" was always a much better showcase for his talents than the clanging ""Fantastic Four"" movies) and he and cinematographer Larry Blanford give Los Angeles a dewy old-movie glow. Perhaps the greatest achievement of ""Think Like a Man"" is that it gives criminally underused actresses like Union Good and Henson the chance to star in a movie that appreciates their talents. So often wasted in small roles these three get to flirt crack wise and be the focus of attention. Its great that someone besides Tyler Perry (whose movies are the butt of several jokes here) is giving black actresses the showcase they deserve. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

""Think Like a Man"" blends Steve Harvey relationship advice four warring couples and a fascinating racial dilemma Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Romantic comedy Life News Entertainment News Taraji P. Henson and Michael Ealy in ""Think Like a Man"" So theres a black guy in the White House who may (or may not) get reelected and were long past the point when anyone finds it weird to find white rural kids listening to hip-hop in their Chevy pickup with the Rebel flag sticker. We absolutely do not live in a post-racial society as the Trayvon Martin case has made clear and for many African-Americans economic and geographic segregation remains a fact of life. But at least in the cultural arena racial signals are more mixed and mingled than ever before as Barack Obamas complicated ancestry and upbringing exemplify. With the emergence of fast-growing and newly confident Latino and Asian-American cultural identities the old black-white polarity of American life is gone forever.How then do we account for the near-total segregation of the relationship comedy and the rom-com? If anything ""Think Like a Man"" the awkward but intermittently amusing black-centric ensemble film built out of comedian Steve Harveys self-help bestseller ""Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man"" deserves a gold star for its generous portrayals of Caucasians. OK its true that one of the white guys in the movie (Gary Owen) is your standard-issue ultra-square doofus found in black-oriented movies since time immemorial whose role is to serve as the butt of white-boy jokes and make accidental racist remarks that the black characters then acknowledge are partly true.The other one though is Jeremy (Jerry Ferrara of ""Entourage"") an unshaven semi-unemployed dope who is one of the storys central band of henpecked bros and whose nerdy bespectacled girlfriend Kristen is played by Gabrielle Union arguably the most gorgeous of ""Think Like a Mans"" bevy of beauties. (If I really wanted to go semiotic on you all I would argue that Ferraras presence calls attention to the fact that race is a subjective category with no scientific meaning Hes white all right but after a Brooklyn Italian fashion and his skin is barely lighter than that of blue-eyed dreamboat Michael Ealy who is black.) Anyway nobody in the movie acts as if Jeremy and Kristens relationship is any sort of groundbreaking event plus you get to see Union play the kind of woman who knows who Frodo Baggins is and wears a Voltron T-shirt. Whether thats in any way convincing is beside the point given that any resemblance between ""Think Like a Man"" and anyones life black or white or otherwise is pure happenstance. But would a ""mainstream"" (i.e. predominantly white) comedy depict an interracial relationship so casually even in 2012? I dont actually think so.Setting aside Jeremy and his impressive collection of early-1990s action figures -- his conflict with Kristen rendered in Steve Harvey-ese is ""The Girl Who Wants a Ring vs. The Non-Committer"" and you get only one guess about who ends up on his knees blubbering with a little box from the jewelry store in his hand -- ""Think Like a Man"" is pretty much just ""Valentines Day"" or ""Hes Just Not That Into You"" with the racial polarity reversed. Director Tim Story and screenwriters Keith Merryman and David A. Newman have to shoehorn four warring couples several sidekicks and a whole bunch of random Harvey-isms into one package and it wont quite fit. (Women are invited to compare themselves to different varieties of fish at the end of an anglers line and cautioned ""Holding out for better is making you bitter."") Im not going to claim this is a good movie in some Platonic-ideal way but I enjoyed it more than I did those paler versions maybe just because the musics better or because its fun to see all these undervalued black actors -- Ealy Union Taraji P. Henson Regina Hall Terrence J Romany Malco and the scabrous hilarious Kevin Hart -- cutting loose even in a scenario as dumb as this one. (Yes controversial Ramp;B star Chris Brown is also in this movie in a bit part as and I quote ""an Axe body spray-wearing man-ho."") You Might Also Like There are a few digs at African-American filmmaking titan Tyler Perry in ""Think Like a Man"" as when one character describes the Perry formula The beautiful woman gets dumped by a bad man and rescued by a good man and they both find Jesus at the end. Theres no savior on hand here and the dialogue is racier and more urbane than Perrys. With the exception of Harts foulmouthed and down-home Cedric (whose estranged wife is played by radio personality Wendy Williams) everybody belongs to the acquisitive upward-bound middle class. But in the larger sense this movie belongs alongside Perrys work in the alternate universe of black-oriented entertainment which not only continues to exist -- as it has in various forms throughout American history -- but may be thriving now more than ever.This may seem curious at first. Many kinds of mainstream Hollywood movies especially thrillers and action flicks have gradually gotten more diverse over the years which may reflect a white audiences increasing willingness to root for heroes of color but probably has a more pragmatic motivation. Anyone who understands moviegoing demographics will tell you that African-Americans and Hispanics are overrepresented -- often dramatically so -- among audiences for action-adventure movies horror films and mainstream comedies. Giving those viewers someone ""relatable"" in the cast (I hate that word but apparently its standard English now) is good marketing sense. Love stories however work by a different logic and a form of circular marketing logic kicks in. Heres how I think it works from Hollywoods point of view One nonwhite couple in the background of a mainstream rom-com is fine and the sassy black friend dispensing advice is a perennial. But if you put an interracial couple in a mainstream movie youre making an apparent statement and running the risk of alienating a handful of more erm ""traditional"" white viewers. (As Ive said ""Think Like a Man"" suggests that black audiences may be less skittish about this.) If you make the black couple too central or push the cast beyond say one-quarter nonwhite you reach some perceived tipping point and its an ""urban"" movie playing in Harlem and Oakland and New Orleans and South Central L.A. at the theaters that played ""Red Tails"" and ""I Can Do Bad All by Myself.""Now there may be some insight about human nature here in that people are always more likely to go see a love story about characters they can identify with (whatever that means). Or maybe its just a matter of bigotry and bad science. Very likely its some of both I really dont know. What I do know is that the film industry is always overly cautious in responding to social change. Remember that ""Philadelphia"" in which the gay couple didnt even kiss was heralded as a breakthrough And that black people will flock to movies like Perrys or Storys (he also made the 2002 hit ""Barbershop"") even when the craftsmanship is indifferent because they so rarely get to see their love lives glamorized or ironized on the big screen whereas whites have gotten to see that happen every month of every year of the last century.

One hardship of moviegoing is that you sometimes watch an actor and wonder why you dont see her as much as she deserves to be seen. Taraji P. Henson is that sort of actor.With her its actually more stressful than that. With her what youre wondering is how no one who makes movies can feel her charisma and decide to take a chance on it. I dont mean seeing Henson and hiring her to take care of Brad Pitt. ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" did change her career (she won an Oscar nomination for it). Right now shes playing a tough cop on that CBS show ""Missing Persons"" in which she can be relied on to bust perps and wear pantsuits with equal parts glamour and grit. But for some of us thats not enough.""Think Like a Man"" is a preview of what enough might be. The movies just adequate - platitudes with romantic-comedy flavoring. Henson and seven other people - Romany Malco Regina Hall Meagan Good Gabrielle Union Jerry Ferrara Michael Ealy and the BET personality Terrence J - pair off and act out scenarios from that best-selling Steve Harvey relationship guide ""Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man."" (The comedian Kevin Hart self-immolates from the sidelines while Gary Owen - ""black Americas favorite white comic"" says Ebony - keeps his cool and is almost as funny).Henson plays Lauren an executive so powerful that shed rather live way up in an airless room at a Ritz-Carlton than anywhere else in Los Angeles. To me thats like going to Dodger Stadium for the golf. But Lauren represents Harveys idea that a woman can be only so successful without scaring off suitors. So when Keith Merryman and David A. Newmans screenplay throws Ealys aspiring chef in her way will snobbery keep her from enjoying all the great sex and postcoital food he cooks?Its not much of a part for Henson. None of these characters makes real-world sense. Theyre walking chapter outlines. The best material in the movie which Tim Story directed has mostly to do with matters of race social behavior and class and less to do with whether Halls single mom can seduce Terrence J away from his flamboyantly domineering mother (Jenifer Lewis; who else?) or if Goods strategically chaste bombshell can tame Malcos cassanova.The Costco approach to romantic comedy runs the same risk that some bulk shopping does. What are you going to do with 60 pounds of 10 pastrami? ""Think Like a Man"" becomes as tedious as ""Valentines Day"" a movie based on a holiday or ""Hes Just Not That Into You"" a movie based on putdowns disguised as advice. The movie Harveys book has inspired happens to feature silly cutaways to the self-contented author whose inky mustache glistens as much as his bald head. He looks like hes posing for wallet-sizes at Sears.Nonetheless two wonderful things occur in ""Think Like a Man."" One is the sexy sight of Morris Chestnut in slow motion. When he makes a cameo here alongside an expensive car a jolt goes through the theater. Which brings me to the other wonderful thing The slow motion is aimed at Henson. Her jaw drops to the pavement. The women in the theater laughing at her reaction are actually laughing at themselves.You really respond to Hensons assurance. Shes the lone actor permitted to move and speak with confidence. Thats her trademark self-belief. She gives all her line readings swerving contours and a little extra breath. Her hairs been cut into a short sharp bob that she swings with abandon. In all her scenes shes flirting. With us with Diana Rosss legacy with the possibility of stardom. Pay attention Hollywood Hensons swinging that hair for you.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. Follow him on Twitter wesley_morris. (c) Copyright 2012 Globe Newspaper Company.

And because ""the CIA aint got nothing on a woman with a plan"" as Anthony Anderson noted in the definitive Defense-Against-Marriage comedy Two Can Play That Game the game is now in overtime. More about Think Like a Man >> Everybody wins in Think Like a Man the disarming comedy based on comedian Steve Harveys self-help book Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man that inventories the strategies of both the offense and the defense. From one perspective it might be reduced to the sentence Gals dont give it up till he puts a ring on it. From another Guys heres how to avoid the three-ring circus of engagement ring wedding ring and suffering. Eight can play this game. And as they include Michael Ealy Meagan Good Kevin Hart Taraji P. Henson Romany Malco Gabrielle Union Jerry Ferrara and Regina Hall. it is hard to imagine a more attractive ensemble. Following the general outlines of Harveys book which presented case studies of presumably incompatible couples such as The Dreamer (Ealy low-key as an aspiring chef) and The Woman Who Is Her Own Man (Henson as a high-powered executive) the film illustrates how opposites on the dating spectrum might complement each other. But because the screenplay conceives courtship as essentially strategic rather than romantic the film strikes the familiar beats of a sporting contest rather than the rarer chords of love. No matter. As there are four intersecting storylines to track and as the rowdy randy screenplay by Keith Merryman and David A. Newman (Friends With Benefits) pitches wisecracks at the speed of 75 m.p.h. it wants only to entertain - and it succeeds. Directed by Tim Story who juggled multiple storylines in Barbershop a similarly entertaining and good-natured comedy the goal here is the same as speed-dating or speed-chess capturing the queen in as few moves as possible. Harvey has a recurring role as himself flogging his book and dispensing advice such as ""Women dont hate the player change the game"" The film goes beyond the hoary ""Read the book see the movie"" synergy by embedding the book within the movie. Unlike Barbershop which unfolds within the particular social context of a black Chicago neighborhood Think Like a Man is set in a universal Los Angeles of hookups fixups and courtships. One would have to have a heart of stone not to melt when Zeke (Malco) king of one-night stands plants a kiss on Mya (Good) who tests his commitment by observing the 90-day rule. The rules of goal-oriented dating and romantic comedy are much the same. If no man proposes marriage from natural causes then unnatural ones will be contrived. Story and collaborators succeed in making a courtship comedy that will entertain women and amuse men. Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at carriedrickeygmail.com.

Henson) go on a date in Tim Storys new movie Think Like a Man. (Ron Batzdorff) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday April 19 2012 217 PM Title Think Like a Man Film Info With Gabrielle Union Taraji P. Henson. Romantic comedy loosely based on Steve Harveys advice guide. Director Tim Story (203). PG-13 Sexuality crude humor. At area theaters. Dating will never be easy. And date-night movies will never be perfect. But if you go in with the right attitude - that is notice the negatives but focus on the positive - ""Think Like a Man"" should make for a solid option on a Friday night. Lets assess the assets first Tim Storys affable rom-com is smart funny and impossibly good-looking. Even in L.A. where the movie is set youd be hard-pressed to find so many gorgeous men and women hanging out together - let alone complaining that they cant find love. All of them are bonded by a common interest Steve Harveys (real-life) romance guide ""Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man."" The ladies are following Harveys advice; the men are stymied by it. Single mom Candace (Regina Hall) has to untie the apron strings for mamas boy Michael (Terrence J). Mya (Meagan Good) wont allow Zeke (Romany Malco) into her bedroom for 90 days. Kristen (Gabrielle Union) wants longtime BF Jeremy (Jerry Ferrara) to finally propose. And status-conscious Lauren (Taraji P. Henson) needs to decide if shes willing to date a broke chef (Michael Ealy). Watching all this frantic activity from the sidelines is Cedric (a hilarious Kevin Hart) who professes to be thrilled about his impending divorce. If youre wondering why I havent mentioned Chris Brown yet its because he appears for about five minutes. He does a serviceable job in his cameo (as an obnoxious player) but focusing on him would be like focusing on the drunk who tripped over your table while youre out to dinner. In other words we have better company to consider Every primary cast member is appealing elevating the disposable plot -- men and women are in constant battle yawn -- into a funny sexy take on contemporary dating. Middling lines are delivered with sharp sass; tired stereotypes are ... well still tired actually (women manipulate and nag men lie and evade). But at least the actors offer gentle twists that take away some of the sting. What cant be made palatable however is the ever-present sense that the movies true goal is to promote Harveys book. ""Steve says"" is a perpetual refrain and Harvey himself shows up regularly to deliver his own advice - mostly cliches that combine ""The Rules"" with ""The Game."" Too often it feels as though were stuck inside an infomercial Harvey made about himself. Still if you can look past the annoying quirks youll probably have a good time. As Steve says sometimes it pays to compromise. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Im not counting on the upcoming What to Expect When Youre Expecting to top it. You never know I know but I am pretty sure that in this case I know. Whatever the truth may be Think Like a Man is better than the last movie of its kind Hes Just Not That Into You which also took a book of relationship advice and somehow beat and stretched and stuffed it into the shape of an ensemble romantic comedy. Think Like a Man uses a similar formula -- a group of men and women engage in various emotional skirmishes -- but it doesnt dabble in too much sincerity never takes its silly premise too seriously and is genuinely funny even though youre pretty sure youve heard a lot of these he said/she said jokes before. Director Tim Story who put together another fine comedy ensemble in Barbershop has assembled a good group here too. There are the guys (Michael Ealy Jerry Ferrera Terrence Jenkins Romany Malco) who play basketball hang out together and brag and/or moan about the women in their lives. Think Like a Man neatly sticks each into a category -- dreamer non-committer mamas boy player -- and then sets about pairing them up with women (Meagan Good Regina Hall Taraji P. Henson Gabrielle Union) whose hopes are quite different. The women you see are tired of disappointment and have realigned their romantic goals after reading Steve Harveys Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man which argues that women need to understand how men think in order to ensnare them. (If youre looking for a 21st century feminist manifesto you will need to look elsewhere.) Thus the good-time girl disappointed by yet another one night stand (Good) vows to stick to Harveys 90-days-without-sex rule -- and meets the player (Malco) who is more of a maybe-90-seconds-without-sex rule kind of guy. The female half of the longtime couple (Union) starts redecorating the home that looks like a frat house; the male half (Ferrera) screams for his missing anime posters. The single mom (Hall) gets mixed up with the mamas boy (Jenkins) and the successful businesswoman (Henson) who wants an equally successful guy falls for the prep cook whos broke but has eyes to die for (Ealy). Orbiting them all like an insane comet is their angry divorced pal (the hilarious Kevin Hart) who shrieks about his ex so much you just know theres got to be more to the story than hes letting on. Naturally the guys -- whose banter is the best thing about the movie -- find out about the book curse Harvey as a traitor to his gender and try to turn the tables -- which inevitably ends badly. But fear not. Think Like A Man isnt about to leave you sad or unfulfilled. Its all about making everybody happy. If thats not grounds for a good relationship then I dont know what is. Cast Kevin Hart Michael Ealy Jerry Ferrara Meagan Good Taraji P. Henson Regina Hill Terrence Jenkins Romany Malco Gabrielle Union. Director Tim Story. Screenwriters Keith Merryman David A. Newman. Based on the book ""Act Like A Lady Think Like a Man"" by Steve Harvey. Producer William Packer. A Screen Gems release. Running time 120 minutes. Sexual humor some crude language brief drug use.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Movies Think Like a Man Men and Women Behaving Bedly A fine cast lends charm to this romantic comedy with a schematic plot but an easy attitude By Richard Corliss April 19 2012 Share Read Later Alan Markfield / Screen GemsGabrielle Union and Jerry Ferrara Think Like a Man Year 2012 Director Tim Story Studio Screen Gems Actors Chris Brown Gabrielle Union Kevin Hart Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture It was said that the key to the political success of the 19th century statesman Benjamin Disraeli the first and only Prime Minister of the United Kingdom born to a Jewish family was that he followed the motto ""Speak British think Yiddish."" With rather more meager credentials the comedian Steve Harvey published a book of romantic advice for women called Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man What Men Really Think About Love Intimacy and Commitment. The book offered such secrets of the male psyche as ""Boys shack; men build homes"" and ""Dont hate the player; change the game"" -- wisdom Harvey presumably gleaned from his three marriages (two divorces) and from hosting the latest edition of Family Feud. Women made the book a No. 1 best-seller in 2009 perhaps because they were amused by a man and a stand-up comic at that trying to practice vajournalism. Other movies made from advice books have sprouted songs as in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying or subverted the very notion of erotic self-help Woody Allens Everything You Wanted to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid to Ask). For their screenplay of Think Like a Man Keith Merryman and David A. Newman took a more modest approach creating characters with different humors to embody Harveys homiletics. The result isnt exactly Restoration comedy in full flower; but as directed by Tim Story (Barbershop) its an ensemble piece that packs more easy enjoyment than I was expecting or even now care to admit to. (READ Belinda Luscombes Qamp;A with Steve Harvey) Six guys meet regularly to play basketball the placidly married token Anglo guy (Gary Owen) the Italian Jeremy (Jerry Ferrara who was Turtle on Entourage) and four blacks. Dominic (Michael Ealy from Barbershop) who dreams of being a chef hooks up with the status-conscious Fortune-500 COO Lauren (Benjamin Buttons Taraji P. Henson). Zeke (Romany Malko) is a player who cant get the vulnerable Mya (Meagan Good) on the fast track to the bedroom. The mamas boy Michael (Terence J) takes flack from mom (Jenifer Lewis) when he hooks up with single mother Candace (Regina Hall). The recently divorced Cedric (Kevin Hart) boasts of his freedom but his loneliness and panic are as evident as his flop sweat. And Jeremys realtor girlfriend Kristen (Gabrielle Union of Deliver Us from Eva) is impatient for him to take time from his video games to in two words grow up. The women have been using the Harvey tome to gain the advantages in love that they have earned in their careers. They feel empowered being reminded that in the banquet of sex they ""control the cookie."" The men are domesticated enough to bide their time. Zeke is frustrated that his five-date maximum for bedding a woman has been superseded by Myas ""90-Day Rule"" -- ""Im a Negro gigolo"" he complains to his pals ""the original nigolo"" -- but he acquiesces because love makes sex worth waiting for. (READ What Makes a Bad Boyfriend?) Halfway through the film they discover the womens playbook and by furtively consulting it are able to anticipate all feminine strategies; one says ""It was like takin a test you already had the answers to."" But in an entertainment scrupulously devised for date nights maturing means that the men must be feminized. When Jeremy finally pops the question to Candace he blurts out ""I want to be your wife."" That the movies writers are white and Harvey and most of the actors African-American is just one reason for homogenized tone of the piece. Merryman and Newman also wrote last years Friends With Benefits a romantic comedy that knowingly parodied and exploited the conventions of the genre. Similarly Think Like a Man both mocks and genuflects before the ensemble romances that came before it. (READ Mary Pols review of Friends With Benefits) Besides being a two-hour infomercial for the book the movie isnt far from Tyler Perrys relationship dramedies (Ealy Union and Lewis have all been in Perry films) but with a higher brow a brisker pace and gentler mood swings. At other times the PG-13 movie seems tiptoeing toward the chattier parts of Zanes Sex Chronicles on late-night Cinemax. It talks endlessly about sex and features some major sloppy kisses but only on the way to enough public declarations of love to fill an Oprah hugathon. The film embraces emotion without quite degenerating into crynography that wretched excess of sentiment; it wants audiences to leave with a smile not wracking sobs all the way home. Schematic and borderline dogmatic Think Like a Man still gives welcome space for its charming cast to behave and misbehave becomingly. Its a treat to see Henson Oscar-nominated as Benjamin Buttons saintly adoptive mother strut a modern-day sexual confidence even if her Lauren has to suffer a comeuppance. (The movie like Soul Food and many a Perry parable is more class-conscious than race-conscious.) Most of the other characters escape stern judgment. These 30-something folks comfortable in their circumstances and their skins are allowed to be smart of heart if baffled by the 21st-century courtship game. (READ Steve Harveys Men-Only Mentoring Weekend) Theres nothing profound going on here; the truisms dont blossom into life-enriching truths. Its more like the person you meet at a bar who on second glance is surprisingly attractive. Call Think Like a Man a perfectly satisfactory one-night stand at the movies.

"Think Like a Man Review - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Steve Harveys relationship rules come to amusing life in Think Like a Man ???April 19 2012|Michael Phillips | Movie criticRelaxed yet lively the byplay in ""Think Like a Man"" has some of the spark of director Tim Storys ""Barbershop"" a decade ago. The movie may be the very definition of contrivance coming as it does from the blithely sexist relationship guide ""Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man"" co-written by radio host and comedian Steve Harvey. Considering its source though one of the more unpromising comedies of the year has turned out ... pretty funny.Few best-sellers ever got that way underestimating the American publics taste for generalities about the gender wars. Harveys 2009 ""how to"" divides humans into two camps those with ""the cookie"" (women) and the cookie monsters (men). Harvey and co-writer Denene Millner categorize the ones with the cookies as either ""sports fish"" or those deserving of the label of ""keeper"" someone who ""understands her power and wields it like a samurai sword.""As another best-seller put it its Mars and Venus and never the twain shall meet. ""A womans love"" writes Harvey ""is emotional nurturing heartfelt -- sweet and kind and all-encompassing."" But as he later writes ""Please understand the way we men connect is by having sex. Period."" Elsewhere Harveys song of himself comes down to unseemly braggadocio as when he surveys the symbols of his accomplishments as a provider a father a man ""... the leather chairs the dogs outside the cars in the yard college tuition for my kids -- everything is paid for everything is set."" Wouldnt it be nice.How did director Story and screenwriters Keith Merryman and David A. Newman (""Friends With Benefits"") squeeze an enjoyable film out of this? By retaining Harveys archetypes but getting creative about humanizing the people wearing the labels. The guys consist of The Player (Romany Malco) The Mamas Boy (Terrence J) The Dreamer (Michael Ealy) The Non-Committer (Jerry Ferrara) The Happily Married Guy (Gary Owen) and The Happily Divorced Guy (Kevin Hart). Their ladies former current and future break down into equally slick headlines. Meagan Good is The 90-Day Rule Girl tired of casual sex but after reading a certain best-seller by Mister Steve Harvey eager to enforce the 90-Day rule (no cookies until the fourth month). And so on.As the movie jumps from one couple to the next with everybody stealing strategies and counter-strategies from the same best-seller by Mister Steve Harvey (who appears on screen as well) a funny thing happens. We begin to care about how some of these folks work it out. Scenes entirely off the plot set on the basketball court or in a bar generate real laughs. And its a pleasure to see Taraji P. Henson dig down into a cliche that of a high-powered tightly wound businesswoman (known here queasily as ""The Woman Who Is Her Own Man"") and come back with someone a little bit complicated. Compare Hensons work here to Janet Jackson swallowing the more melodramatic""Why Did I Get Married Too?"" whole and you have the difference between a sparkling team player playing with equally strong cohorts and a one-gulp solo act.""Think Like a Man"" is what it is. But its hangout factor is considerable because the actors charms are considerable. Also Story likes to keep two or more performers in the same shot at the same time which means the actors are allowed to interact. The verbal jokes are often unexpected and often witty. Compared to certain holiday-themed Garry Marshall ensemble comedies I wont be re-watching onNew Years Eve or Valentines Day this one sticks to a formula without falling prey to it.mjphillipstribune.comThink Like a Man -- 3 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for sexual content some crude humor and brief drug use)Running time 200Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesJohn Gray Adds A Magazine To His Mars And Venus UniverseFebruary 9 1998Alls Fare In Love And Gender WarsSeptember 13 1998Surprises in gender-gap researchSeptember 24 2008Mending Gender GapJune 12 1994Speaking Of DifferencesNovember 9 1997Find More Stories AboutTim StoryTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0417-think-like-a-man-20120419,0,2332674.column",200,thinklikeaman22,thinklikeaman,chicagotribune

Share Tweet Think Like A Man is less a feature-film adaptation of Act Like A Lady Think Like A Man--a bestselling relationship guide by comedian and Family Feud host Steve Harvey--than an insanely overlong infomercial for the book. The comedy treats Harveys book as a Rosetta stone that unlocks the mysteries of mens minds and of male-female relationships. Harvey appears throughout to deliver ostensibly sage pronouncements on an Oprah-style talk show In spite of his decades in show business as a stand-up comedian actor radio personality and game-show host hes as stiff and unconvincing playing himself as any amateur actor. Still he has to be flattered by a movie that features characters all but getting into fistfights over the opportunity to buy his book. Steve Harvey worship is even written into the films asinine premise Think Like A Man finds a group of gorgeous professionally accomplished black women reading Harveys book and gaining the upper hand in their relationships with a gaggle of emotionally stunted man-children. Then the fellows figure out that Harvey has betrayed his gender by revealing all their secrets so they devour the gurus tell-all themselves and turn the tables on the scheming females. Think Like A Man reduces the war between the sexes and the infinite mysteries of romance and relationships to a bland pandering assortment of beer-commercial stereotypes and generalities. Men like to drink beer play basketball and avoid commitment even to women who should be universes out of their league. Meanwhile women like to drink wine gossip with their girlfriends pressure men into commitment and ask about short and long-term goals. Barbershop director Tim Story has assembled an attractive overqualified cast that includes Taraji P. Henson Romany Malco Gabrielle Union and Meagan Good but the only actor who makes much impression is Kevin Hart in the Cedric The Entertainer role of the manic irascible shit-talker seemingly given free rein to improvise. He isnt particularly funny (nothing in Think Like A Man is) but his performance has an impish energy that the rest of Storys super-slick film lacks. Think Like A Mans silky buppie charms are barely enough to support a trailer let alone a film that drones on for two interminable hours. Considering its utter lack of substance thats a seeming eternity even for a film based on such a theoretically groundbreaking all-important instructive book.

In fact youve seen it dozens of times. And even if you never buy a ticket or move the DVD to the top of your Netflix queue youll see it dozens more times in the years to come. Thats because it recycles the same tired battle-of-the-sexes premise employed by every third romantic comedy that gets made. Think Like a Man Bad Director Tim Story. Cast Michael Ealy Meagan GoodTaraji P. Henson Gabrielle Union. Rating PG-13 for sexual content some crude humor and brief drug use. The film is based on comedian Steve Harveys real-life non-fiction relationship-advice book ""Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man What Men Really Think About Love Relationships Intimacy and Commitment."" Harvey breaks people down into types and relationships are introduced with such title headings as ""The mamas boy vs. the single mom"" and ""The non-committer vs. the girl who wants the ring."" Love advice from the minds of Think Like a Man Male friends find themselves in trouble when their love interests discover Harveys book (which through cute wishful thinking sells out faster than an eighth ""Harry Potter"" book would). The women dutifully dog-ear and highlight key passages and start following Harveys advice to get their way. Whenever two women share the screen they inevitably start a conversation with the words ""Steve says..."" Thats right theyre on a first-name basis. At times it feels more like an elaborate advertisement to boost book sales than it does a romantic comedy. Harvey periodically pops in infomercial-style to dispense nuggets of wisdom about how men are like this and women are like that. Did you know that men want sex and women like to be held? Brave stuff that. Original too. In fairness ""Think Like a Man"" isnt trying to re-invent the wheel. Its an ensemble comedy with a low bar to clear and the cast makes an honest go of it. Michael Ealy is a gentle dreamy-eyed hunk as Dominic a lowly prep cook looking to charm Taraji P. Hensons Lauren a business woman whos way out of his league. Theres real chemistry in some of the pairings especially between Meagan Goods confident Mya and Romany Malcos game-playing Zeke.Genuine tension crackles between them as Mya resolves not to ""open the cookie jar"" (so to speak) until after 90 days of dating. But the laughs are too infrequent and lazy to do the cast justice. And there are enough mean-spirited gay jokes that you can keep a tally (eight by my count after it occurred to me to start keeping track). Oh and Chris Brown is in it. Even though his screen time amounts to little more than a cameo and he plays a cad his presence is an unwelcome distraction. Youd hope that a movie that tackles the gender divide -- however ham-handed the attempt -- would at least avoid stunt-casting anyone who sent his girlfriend to the hospital in the past three years. Anyway the men eventually discover Harveys book and realize the women have been testing them. Then they start to use the book to thwart the women. When the women find out that the men know that they know about the book the way should be paved for some serious screwball antics as each sex tries to out-game the other.

(AP Photo/Sony Pictures-Screen Gems Alan Markfield) / APShare Photo What is essentially a shameless and overlong infomercial for Steve Harveys dating advice book becomes more tolerable and even enjoyable at times with the help of an attractive likable cast in ""Think Like a Man."" Harveys best-seller ""Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man"" serves as the launching pad for four intertwined stories in which various types couple up and try to make a go of it. Theres Dominic The Dreamer (Michael Ealy) and Lauren The Woman Who Is Her Own Man (Taraji P. Henson); Zeke The Player (Romany Malco) and Mya The 90-Day-Rule Girl (Meagan Good); and so on. But the ladies involved are armed with the knowledge of male romantic peculiarities that theyve gleaned from the book - Tim Storys film makes it seem as if every woman in Los Angeles carries it around all day like a Bible - so every move they make is calculated and executed strategically to get what they want. Conversely the men grow suspicious find out that the book exists and turn its words back on the women as their own weapon to get what they want. These kinds of manipulative machinations seem arduous and archaic - and they did back in the mid-1990s when they were better known as ""The Rules"" a book which itself arose from Eisenhower-era notions about the proper way for a lady to behave in a relationship. Gabrielle Unions character - Kristen The Ring Girl - comes off as especially obnoxious when she tosses out all the fanboy collectibles belonging to her boyfriend of nine years Jeremy The Non-Committer (Jerry Ferrara). Its been nine years already - just leave the dude rather than forcing him to become who you want him to be. Im all for putting the best version of yourself out there and whatever happens happens. But hey the source material is what it is so what are you gonna do? Story has a way with a comic ensemble cast having directed ""Barbershop""; he keeps things moving at a (mostly) lively clip and gives Los Angeles a glossy sheen. (Besides serving as an extended ad for Harveys book ""Think Like a Man"" also feels like a promotional tourism video for certain sections of Culver City where Sonys studios are located as well as the LA Live entertainment complex downtown.) Ealy and Henson are insanely sexy together and unlike the rest of the characters they feel like actual grown-ups; the scene in which he brings her breakfast in bed shirtless is sure to inspire audible gasps. Stand-up comedian Kevin Hart is unsurprisingly a scene-stealer as the fast-talking newly divorced guy of the bunch. The banter between the male friends who frequently meet to play basketball provides a snappy energy as well as some amusing cameos. And you have to give ""Think Like a Man"" credit for not only trying to serve as an alternative to Tyler Perry-style date-night fare but for even going so far as to make fun of those movies for their soapy conventions. But the script from Keith Merryman and David A. Newman who also wrote ""Friends With Benefits"" is crammed with plot and gets bogged down with contrivances. Will Michael The Mamas Boy (Terrence J) finally snip those apron strings and find love with Candace The Single Mom (Regina Hall)? Probably. But only after a lot of time angst and the kind of embarrassingly public I-love-yous that only take place in the movies.

Based on Original King of Comedy and Family Feud host Steve Harveys self-help primer Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man this adaptation by Tim Story (Fantastic Four) often plays like a book on tape The women characters advising one another about 90-day rules and ""controlling the cookie"" begin their lines with ""As Steve Harvey says . . ."" and the author himself (who also executive-produced) frequently pops up directly addressing the camera and quoting himself. When the male counterparts of four dyads--one long-term couple plus three sets of daters--realize their girlfriends have been putting Harveys words into action they strike back with calculations of their own the manipulations apparently laying the groundwork for fulfilling relationships based on trust and open communication. Enduring a day-long session of couples therapy is more fun (and flies by faster) than this film but relief is found whenever Michael Ealy as a caterer trying to impress Taraji P. Hensons class-conscious CEO and the redoubtable ham Jenifer Lewis mother to a worshipful son are on-screen.

TWITTER Steve Harveys relationship advice book hits the big screen with a funny all-star ensemble. The age-old battle of the sexes is equipped with some fresh ground rules in the astute contemporary romantic comedy Think Like a Man. As executed by an appealing ensemble of smooth operators this adaptation of the Steve Harvey advice book Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man often hits its amusing marks but with a weighty running time of two hours it often feels more like a lecture than an intended romp. Nevertheless that attractive cast and the silky production values combined with Harveys loyal radio stand-up and Family Feud following should ensure that the Screen Gems release opens strongly drawing an urban audience in the market for a more urbane Tyler Perry. PHOTOS Hollywoods Color-Balancing Act Harvey plays the part of himself here -- that of a best-selling author whose book instructs women to kick their relationships up a notch by spilling a few secrets regarding how guys really feel about stuff like intimacy and commitment. Among those who manage to get their hands on a hot copy are Gabrielle Union (she also appeared in the similarly themed 2004 rom-com Breakin All the Rules) who plays the longtime live-in girlfriend of slacker Jerry Ferrara (the Non-Committer) and is tired of their place resembling a dorm room. Theres also Taraji P. Hensons demanding exec who learns to readjust her high standards in order to let in Michael Ealys attentive but broke struggling chef (the Dreamer) and Regina Hall as a single mom who meets nice guy Terrence J whos great with her kid but turns out to be a classic Mamas Boy. Rounding out the quartet of readily identifiable types is Romany Malco the Player a sweet-talking commitment-phobe whose bluff is called when he meets vulnerable Meagan Good who adopts Harveys 90-day rule before succumbing to his advances. STORY 5 Facts About Tyler Perry But just when these women seem to be getting the upper hand in the respective relationships the men get wise to Harveys teachings and proceed to turn the tables. While screenwriters Keith Merryman amp; David A. Newman (Friends With Benefits) know their way around smart male-female banter they never quite succeeded in making a seamless book-to-movie transition. Having Harvey frequently dispensing advice from his book can be a real distraction from the fictional characters and their stories not to mention resemble something that could be confused for shameless selfpromotion. And although director Tim Story (Barbershop) is no stranger to ensemble comedy-dramas all the intersecting stories being told here could have benefited from a lighter less purposeful touch. He does coax some fine performances from his impeccably manicured cast which also includes the always terrific Jenifer Lewis as the suffocating mother in question. Kevin Hart provides extensive comic relief as the strip bar-frequenting Happily Divorced Guy. And Chris Brown keeps popping up as Goods professed last of the one-night stands. Technically the production is sleekly high gloss thanks to Chris Cornwells upscale production design and Larry Blanfords elegant cinematography which while on the subject of marketing opportunities effectively combine to serve as a ready-made promo for L.A. Live and environs.

Romany Malco and Jerry Ferrara in Think Like a Man (Alan Markfield/Sony Pictures Classics) B- Think Like a Man Starring Taraji P. Henson; Starring Kevin Hart Gabrielle Union; Director Tim Story; Author Steve Harvey; Release Date Wide 04/20/2012; Runtime (in minutes) 109; MPAA Rating PG-13 Posted May 3 2012 -- 1200 AM EDT If anything can make you long for the hang-loose 1970s its the prospect of looking for love in an era when dating is governed by more regimented thinking than the old Soviet Union. First came The Rules which said that the best way for women to nab a mate was by refusing to give it up (basically the code of the 1950s). Then came The Game which said that if women are playing by The Rules then the only way for men to push past those defenses is to pretend to be even bigger cads than they are (which according to the theory secretly flatters women by tapping their desire to tame the male animal). Then came Steve Harveys Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man which funneled The Rules and The Game into one book by explaining to women all the ways that men are trying to outthink them. Romantics of the world do your heads hurt yet? Think Like a Man an amorous ensemble comedy based on Harveys 2009 best-seller follows a dozen mostly African-American men and women as they attempt to navigate the brave new world of love by the book. The movie which is very sitcom-setup-driven (its The Best Man meets Valentines Day) introduces its embattled pairings with titles like ""The Non-Committer vs. The Girl Who Wants the Ring"" and ""The Dreamer vs. The Woman Who Is Her Own Man."" For a while the cookie-cutter behavioral tics are funny in an overly broad way even if the dialogue is basically stand-up patter turned into glib fast conversation. And the actors make good company. I especially liked Romany Malco as the velvet-smooth player Zeke; Meagan Good as the spiky Mya who finds it hard to stick to her dating-war codes; and Kevin Hart as the hilariously raging Cedric who cant stop jabbering about the divorce he only thinks he wants. Yet Think Like a Man is so busy tracking courtship as if it were a science project that the bite-size love stories lack spontaneity. When the women first get hold of Harveys book the manipulations that ensue are fun. When the men read the book and try to out-psych the women the film should grow ever foxier in its complications -- but instead it comes down to a bunch of horndogs pretending to be chivalrous which is repetitive and kind of soggy. Thats the downside of staging a romantic comedy by the rules.

Translating Steve Harveys bestseller ""Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man"" into a four-pronged romantic comedy Tim Storys breezy if predictable film overstays its welcome. While the result deserves some credit for finding a creative way to bring the book to life the overlapping storylines simply arent compelling enough despite the best efforts of a game and attractive cast. Mostly ""Think Like a Man"" plays like shrewd promotion for the book but the best advice would be to skip the former and read the latter. Pic falls somewhere between raucousness and date-night schmaltz and returns should be similarly mixed. Whatever the films assets more than two hours is a lot to ask of an audience with this sort of flimsy construct even with multiple stories designed to convey various aspects of Harveys guide to helping women understand men on the subject of relationships. Harvey the multifaceted comic appears as a talkshow guest plugging the book (Sherri Shepherd has a cameo as the daytime host) then turns up throughout directly addressing the camera. The conceit is that the book becomes such a sensation that women begin rushing to absorb its secrets and crack the male code. The primary twist such as it is involves their practicing Harveys teachings to achieve their goals only to have the men eventually buy the book as well and realize theyre being manipulated. Regarding those males several varieties Harvey identifies are conveniently represented by one group of friends who play basketball together several times each week. They include the mamas boy (Terrence J) who becomes involved with single mom Candace (Regina Hall); the dreamer (Michael Ealy) who stumbles into a liaison with Lauren (Taraji P. Henson) a successful businesswoman who wants a man equally well situated; the non-committer (""Entourages"" slimmed-down Jerry Ferrara) whose Peter Pan routine is beginning to wear on his longtime girlfriend (Gabrielle Union); and the ladies man (""Weeds"" Romany Malco) who is forced to actually try wooing Mya (Meagan Good) who after one too many one-night stands follows Harveys maxim about withholding sex in order to find true love. Finally theres Cedric (comedian Kevin Hart) the divorced guy who keeps regaling the group with stories about his ex-wife frequents strip clubs and functions as narrator while providing a steady infusion of manic energy seemingly designed to prevent the sappier aspects from weighing down the comedy. Each of the intersecting plots could be (and indeed has been) stretched into a romantic comedy all its own. Yet if blending them together offers a way of hedging bets and maximizing opportunities for laughs it also becomes somewhat numbing especially in the later stages when Story and writers Keith Merryman and David A. Newman have to race around attempting to neatly tie up all their plot threads. Best known for ""Barbershop"" before his sojourn into the spandex-clad world of ""Fantastic Four"" Story does deliver some funny moments and incorporates enough cameos (including NBA players Chris Brown and radio/TV host Wendy Williams) to leave few marketing stones unturned. That said some scenes drag on interminably particularly when the women or guys are alone discussing dating strategies. One sequence in which the warring factions separately recount a date brings to mind the ""Summer Lovin?"" number from ""Grease"" only with less music and more drawn out. Theres also something rather quaint frankly about the premise of a dating-advice book being so influential as if there were a dearth of them or Oprahs Book Club were still in its heyday. Pic does make good use of its Los Angeles environs and an expansive soundtrack especially in the more romantic moments. Kudos too to the glamorous way the movie adorns its leading ladies. Ultimately though ""Think Like a Man"" dilutes its strengths -- perhaps because nobody bothered to think like an editor.
